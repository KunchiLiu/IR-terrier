	<brief_summary>Rationale : There ample evidence inflammatory process play role pathophysiology schizophrenia . Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) show able reduce symptom patient , drug either unfavourable cardiovascular side effect otherwise well tolerate . Moreover , patient schizophrenia already tend increase cardiovascular risk . The combination well-established vascular protection reduction inflammation simvastatin offer highly attractive potential improve treatment schizophrenia relate disorder . Hypotheses : Daily treatment 40mg simvastatin addition antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptom , improve cognition , attenuate brain volume loss , decrease risk metabolic syndrome well movement disorder , compare placebo . Objective : The primary objective trial investigate propose beneficial effect simvastatin compare placebo give one year addition antipsychotic medication patient psychotic disorder . We expect low symptom severity measure PANSS ( Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ) less cognitive decline measure BACS ( Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia ) .Secondary objective assessment general functioning , presence severity metabolic syndrome degree movement disorder , assessment brain volume . Lastly , examine various immunological parameter serum peripheral blood mononuclear cell experience childhood trauma . Study design : Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial . Study population : 250 men woman , 18 50 year age , diagnose schizophrenia , schizoaffective schizophreniform disorder ( DSM-IV 295 . * ) psychosis NOS ( otherwise specify ) ( 298.9 ) . Onset first psychosis longer 3 year ago . Intervention : Patients randomize 1:1 either 40 mg simvastatin placebo daily , form identical tablet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Different line evidence suggest low grade inflammation central nervous system involve pathogenesis schizophrenia . These include altered risk schizophrenia patient relatives specific auto-immune disease , clinical similarity course schizophrenia auto-immune disease decrease prevalence schizophrenia men use Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) glucocorticosteroids somatic disorder . Furthermore , infectious cause trigger suggest observed association schizophrenia pre- perinatal infection , well seroconversion certain pathogen patient schizophrenia . On cellular level , inflammation central nervous system suggest increased number activate microglia cell brain patient schizophrenia visualized positron electron tomography . In activated state , microglia cell produce free radical , pro-inflammatory component neurotoxic substance , cause cell death proximity . The activation microglia cell provide possible route increase pro-inflammatory state brain could cause increased gray matter loss severe negative cognitive symptom . Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) show able reduce symptom patient , drug either unfavourable cardiovascular side effect otherwise well tolerate . Moreover , patient schizophrenia already tend increase cardiovascular risk . The combination well-established vascular protection reduction inflammation simvastatin offer highly attractive potential improve treatment schizophrenia relate disorder . Hypotheses : Daily treatment 40mg simvastatin addition antipsychotic treatment reduces psychotic symptom , improve cognition , attenuate brain volume loss , decrease risk metabolic syndrome well movement disorder , compare placebo . Objective : The primary objective trial investigate propose beneficial effect simvastatin compare placebo give one year addition antipsychotic medication patient psychotic disorder . We expect low symptom severity measure Positive And Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) less cognitive decline measure Brief Assessment Cognition Schizophrenia ( BACS ) .Secondary objective assessment general functioning use General Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , presence severity metabolic syndrome , define American Heart Association/National Heart , Lung Blood Institute ( AHA/NHLB ) , presence severity movement disorder use validated scale , assessment brain volume magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Lastly , examine various immunological parameter serum peripheral blood mononuclear cell experience childhood trauma use Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form ( CTQ-SF ) . Study design : Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial . Study population : 250 men woman , 18 50 year age , diagnose schizophrenia , schizoaffective schizophreniform disorder ( DSM-IV 295 . * ) psychosis NOS ( otherwise specify ) ( 298.9 ) . Duration disease three year . Intervention : Patients randomize 1:1 either 40 mg simvastatin placebo daily , form identical tablet . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome change total symptom severity ( PANSS score ) baseline end treatment . Secondary outcome change GAF score , cognitive functioning , presence severity metabolic syndrome movement disorder assessment brain volume change , addition measurement various immunological biomarkers , childhood trauma . depression symptom . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Use simvastatin implies risk side effect , lipid-lowering drug carry risk negative effect . The number patient visit limit mainly require time investment physical examination , questionnaire two cognitive test session ( around 10 hour per year total ) . Blood draw four occasion negligible know risk ( e.g . irritation ) . The burden risk acceptable benefit expect considerable .</detailed_description>
