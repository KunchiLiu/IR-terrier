	<brief_summary>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy complicate weak breathing muscle lung infection . `` Lung volume recruitment '' technique perform use face mask mouthpiece hand-held resuscitation bag stack breath , inflate lung help clear airway secretion increase forcefulness cough . We believe slow steady loss lung function , prevent lung infection , improve quality life . Our aim compare outcome group individual DMD treat standard care another group also receive lung volume recruitment . If effective , study change clinical practice include twice-daily treatment part standard care individual DMD , order improve lung health quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Respiratory complication primary cause morbidity mortality associate childhood Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) . Involvement respiratory muscle lead progressive hypoventilation and/or recurrent atelectasis pneumonia secondary decrease cough efficacy . Lung volume recruitment ( LVR ) mean stack breath achieve maximal lung inflation ( MIC ) , prevent micro-atelectasis , improve cough efficacy . Although recommended expert `` standard care '' individual neuromuscular disease , strategy widely implement DMD give lack clinical trial date support efficacy well additional burden care require population already require multiple intervention . Primary Objective : To determine whether LVR , addition conventional treatment , successful reduce decline baseline force vital capacity ( FVC ) 2 year ( percent predict , measure accord American Thoracic Society standard ) , compare conventional treatment alone child DMD . Secondary Objectives : To determine difference child treat LVR addition conventional treatment , compare treated conventional treatment alone , : ( 1 ) number course antibiotic , hospitalization intensive care admission respiratory exacerbation , ( 2 ) health-related quality life , ( 3 ) peak cough flow pulmonary function test . Methods : We propose 3-year multi-centre randomize control trial involve fifteen tertiary care pediatric hospital across Canada . The study population consist boy age 6-16 year DMD FVC ≥ 30 % predict . A sample size 110 participant enrol . This informed chart review survey participate centre feasible , re-assessed ongoing internal pilot study . Intervention : Participants allocate minimization procedure receive conventional treatment ( non-invasive ventilation , nutritional supplementation , physiotherapy and/or antibiotic , decide treat physician ) conventional treatment plus twice daily LVR exercise perform inexpensive , portable self-inflating resuscitation bag contain one-way valve mouthpiece . Data Analysis : The primary outcome ( change percent predict FVC 2 year ) compare two study group use analysis co-variance ( ANCOVA ) take account baseline FVC minimization factor . Importance : Decline pulmonary function among child DMD negatively affect quality life predict mortality . The relatively simple strategy LVR potential optimize pulmonary function reduce respiratory exacerbation , thereby improve quality life individual DMD . This study novel first randomize control trial LVR . A major strength result give support refute recommendation regard inclusion LVR standard care individual DMD worldwide .</detailed_description>
