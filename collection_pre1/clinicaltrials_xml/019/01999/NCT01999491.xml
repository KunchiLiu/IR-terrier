	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Pharmacokinetic Study NC-4016 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , enrol either dose escalation group dose expansion group . Dose Escalation : If dose escalation group , assign dose level base join study . Up 6 dose level NC-4016 test least 3 patient enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level NC-4016 . Each new group receive high dose NC-4016 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose NC-4016 found . Dose Expansion : If dose expansion group , receive NC-4016 high dose tolerate escalation group . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . On Day 1 cycle , receive NC-4016 vein 2 hour . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . If severe side effect , dose study drug may delay . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Your vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature ) monitor every 20 minute infusion 1 hour end infusion Cycle 1 right end infusion cycle . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You neurological exam electromyogram . - You EKG start infusion , end infusion , 1 hour end infusion ( Cycle 1 2 ) . After Cycle 1 , 1 EKG dosing . On Days 8 15 cycle , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 2 Cycle 1 EKG correspond 24 hour PK testing . Every 3 cycle ( every 9 week ) : - You x-ray , CT , MRI , PET scan check status disease . - If lymphoma , bone marrow biopsy check status disease . - You nerve conduction evaluation . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn tumor marker test . PK Testing : Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - On Day 1 Cycles 1 3 , blood drawn , 0.5 , 1 , 2 hour infusion , 9 time 12 hour receive study drug ( 13 draw total day ) . - On Days 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 15 Cycles 1 3 , blood drawn 1 time receive study drug . - On Day 1 Cycles 2 Cycle 4 , blood drawn 1 time receive study drug . Urine Collection : Urine collect PK test follow time point Cycles 1 3 : - Before receive study drug - 0-2 hour ( infusion ) - 2-4 hour receive study drug - 4-8 hour receive study drug - 8-12 hour receive study drug - 12-24 hour receive study drug You collect urine home 24 hour follow time receive study drug : - Days 1-2 - Days 2-3 - Days 7-8 - Days 14-15 - Days 21-22 Your study doctor provide urine collection bottle . Your urine sample contain small amount platinum study drug . This consider risk , precaution , urine collection container handle , container label `` Bio-Hazard '' . If severe side effect , may extra test side effect get well . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefitting . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , develop new health problem , doctor think longer best interest receive study drug , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-dosing visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 28 day last dose NC-4016 : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam electromyogram . - You chest x-ray . - You x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , bone marrow biopsy lymphoma , check status disease . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You EKG ECHO MUGA . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn tumor marker test . This investigational study . NC-4016 commercially available FDA approve . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain NC-4016 design work . Up 40 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
