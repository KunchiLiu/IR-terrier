	<brief_summary>Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy ( NBPP ) , characterize weakness sensory loss affect arm , result damage prenatal period nerve extend spine arm . Proper stretch exercise joint affect arm time diagnosis greatly assist development healthy movement limb . Additionally , neuromuscular electrical stimulation show effective treatment neural disorder therefore effectiveness NBPP worth study . In case NBPP patient , loss normal arm function observe early . Young patient often neglect use affect arm modify motion avoid use biceps muscle , specifically hand mouth action grip bottle place toys object mouth . A goal study test effectiveness NMES biceps muscle improve participant 's ability perform normal hand mouth action . Additionally , biceps muscle Medical Research Council ( MRC ) strength active range motion ( AROM ) test examine increase useful arm movement . The subject study newborns age 3-6 month already part University Michigan Brachial Plexus program . Parents child train perform neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy home use EMPI Continuum unit 30 minute day monthly follow appointment perform research occupational therapist throughout three month study period . Parents participant complete questionnaire study period help analyze confounders gather data regarding parent compliance NMES effectiveness . To detect effectiveness NMES , two cohort group use standard unit sham unit recruit compare data analysis . The investigator predict NMES effectively improve ability neonate increase use affect arm , specifically hand mouth movement aspects biceps MRC score AROM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate whether use Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) , via Empi® Continuum unit , improve ability child Neonatal Brachial Plexus Palsy ( NBPP ) able use biceps muscle activity daily live . The investigator intend measure NMES aid patient use affected arm perform routine activity like bring hand bottle mouth . Additionally , investigator examine muscle strength participant ' ability perform active range motion ( AROM ) movement . Patients divide cohort group one group receive NMES receive sham NMES . The investigator plan analyze effect one treatment intervention NMES determine device improve function biceps muscle motion , strength functional activity</detailed_description>
