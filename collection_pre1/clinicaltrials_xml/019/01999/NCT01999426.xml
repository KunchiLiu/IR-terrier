	<brief_summary>Emergency on-call respiratory physiotherapy cover child intensive care frequently provide physiotherapist ordinarily work non-respiratory area . This produced concern safety efficacy on-call treatment widely recognise important clinical governance issue affect service throughout National Health Service ( NHS ) . The aim study investigate whether emergency on-call respiratory physiotherapy service provide paediatric intensive care unit ( ICU ) safe effective . Further explore whether quantifiable difference specialist on-call physiotherapy treatment . The study randomise , cross-over study design . Infants child likely require least 2 physiotherapy treatment one day recruit study . Both physiotherapy airway clearance treatment administer 12 hour period , least 2 hour treatment . One administer respiratory physiotherapist work regularly ICU one physiotherapist on-call rota , normally practise non-respiratory clinical area . Treatments perform randomised order outcome measure , treatment . Physiotherapy staff consent participate study include : Specialist respiratory physiotherapist regularly work ICU Non-respiratory physiotherapist on-call rota normally work non-respiratory area cover ICU overnight weekend . Patients include : study aim recruit 80 infant child ( age 0 16 year ) , paediatric intensive care unit 1 . Require full mechanical ventilation well sedate 2 . Are likely require least two physiotherapy treatment within day study ( assessed independent senior respiratory physiotherapist ) 3 . Whose parent carers consent participate study . Respiratory mechanic , arterial blood gas , oxygen saturation peak pressure record intervention Forces apply manual technique , flow , pressure volume manual lung inflation , volume saline selection order treatment component record treatment Adverse event occur 30 minute physiotherapy also record .</brief_summary>
