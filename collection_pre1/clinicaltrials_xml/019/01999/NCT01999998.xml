	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy follow radiotherapy use treat early stage lymphomas excellent cure rate . However , significant proportion patient develop cancer heart diseases year later result radiotherapy . Therefore , move reduce radiation exposure without compromise cure rate . Radiotherapy plan use CT scan take follow chemotherapy many original site lymphoma longer visible use CT scan take follow chemotherapy many original site lymphoma longer visible . In order safely minimise volume treat radiotherapy necessary accurately reconstruct extent lymphoma prior chemotherapy 'planning ' CT scan . A PETCT prior chemotherapy best way demonstrate original extent lymphoma , take different position radiotherapy treatment position . This aim study explore whether PETCT scan take prior chemotherapy radiotherapy treatment position , conjunction advance software combine scan subsequent radiotherapy planning CT , use accurately identify lymphoma target . The study aim recruit 20 patient early stage Hodgkin lymphoma high grade nonHodgkin lymphoma . A routine staging PETCT follow session PETCT radiotherapy treatment position appropriate radiotherapy immobilisation device . Participation study affect treatment decision radiotherapy plan process . The PETCT radiotherapy planning position make available treating clinician . The process planning radiotherapy systematically alter study . The study aim determine improve radiotherapy planning process future , hope reduce long term side effect treatment whilst retain high cure rate .</brief_summary>
