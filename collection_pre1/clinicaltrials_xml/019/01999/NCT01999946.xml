	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effectiveness extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) vs. enhance treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) among opioid dependent adult leave NYC jail . In parallel , propose recruit match , quasi-experimental methadone cohort , result naturalistic comparison XR-NTX vs. establish jail-based methadone treatment program standard-of-care . Our primary aim compare time-to-relapse among participant treat XR-NTX vs. randomize TAU control time-to-relapse among XR-NTX arm vs. jail-based MTP participant , follow release jail . Secondary aim compare relate opioid treatment outcomes post-release across arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended-Release Naltrexone Opioid Treatment Jail Re-Entry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize control trial XR-NTX ( n=85 ) vs. enhance TAU ( n=85 ) among opioid dependent adult leave NYC jail explicitly reject agonist treatment . Initiating treatment week prior release continue 24 week post-release , hypothesize XR-NTX arm demonstrate significantly longer time-to-relapse vs. TAU . In parallel , propose recruit match , quasi-experimental methadone cohort ( n=85 ) , result naturalistic comparison XR-NTX vs. establish jail-based MTP standard-of-care . Rationale : Immediate relapse drug , alcohol , tobacco use nearly universal expect near-term outcome among adult addiction disorder leave U.S. jail . Yet opioid agonist therapy proven effective re-entry intervention , many US correctional facility , include almost large U.S. municipal jail , offer treatment . However , New York City ( NYC ) , jail-to-community methadone treatment , since 1986 , well-studied standard-of-care , yet many inmate eligible initiate methadone treatment program ( MTP ) incarcerate , possibly due anti-methadone patient preference . Rather , vast majority jail detainee undergo brief 6-day methadone taper follow arrest , remain jail brief period out-of-treatment 'drug free ' undergoing decline physiologic opioid tolerance , nearly universally relapse heroin illicit opioid use follow release , re-arrested next 12 month rate 50-75 % . Extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX , Vivitrol ) , FDA-approved opioid dependence , produce 30-day mu opioid receptor antagonist blockade , offer potentially promising modality 'inoculating ' person leave jail immediate opioid relapse . Persons inject 380mg XR-NTX unable effectively experience euphoria respiratory depression return average dos illicit opioids ensue 4-5 week . An injection prior release would possibly give individual month return home jail , experience opioid abstinence , either continue XR-NTX , initiate agonist behavioral treatment , , resume significantly postpone relapse illicit use . Our team recently establish feasibility administer XR-NTX opioid dependent adult within week release NYC jail . We propose conduct large , definitive randomize control trial estimate effectiveness XR-NTX opioid treatment release jail vs. counseling- referral-enhanced treatment-as-usual ( TAU ) condition . We also propose recruit non-randomized , quasi-experimental cohort participant jail-based methadone maintenance program ( MTP ) , allow additional comparison XR-NTX methadone standard-of-care . Specific Aim 1 : Randomized Effectiveness Trial XR-NTX vs. TAU Jail-to-Community Re-Entry Opioid Relapse Prevention . Our primary aim compare time-to-relapse among participant treat XR-NTX vs. randomize TAU control , follow release jail . Specific Aim 2 : Quasi-Experimental Comparison XR-NTX vs. Methadone Treatment Program Re-Entry Opioid Relapse Prevention . To compare time-to-relapse among XR-NTX RCT arm vs. jail-based MTP participant use quasi-experimental design . Specific Aim 3a-e : Related Opioid Treatment Outcomes . To compare re-entry rate 5 treatment outcome across arm : 3a ) community treatment initiation retention , 3b ) opioid illicit drug alcohol use , define continuous count day , amount/day , urine toxicology , 3c ) injection drug use HIV sexual risk factor , 3d ) accidental drug overdose mortality , , 3e ) rate re-incarceration exploratory analysis cost-effectiveness . Implications : While grow interest newly approve use XR-NTX opioid treatment , effectiveness evaluate correctional facility , include large municipal jail , vs. usual care , context standard-of-care methadone treatment . This study allow provider , correctional public health authority , include collaborator NYC Department Health Mental Hygiene , payer policy maker assess utility XR-NTX re-entry opioid treatment , important implication limit great public safety societal cost heroin prescription opioid addiction . Further , NYC jail inmate predominantly African American Hispanic , represent community disproportionately affected unemployment , family poverty , HIV hepatitis C , downstream effect opioid dependence . As majority opioid addict person leave jail return neighborhood untreated prone rapid relapse , hypothesize add XR-NTX re-entry 'toolbox ' save money live under-served community . This study part NIDA `` Studies Medication Addiction Treatment Correctional Settings ( SOMATICS ) '' U01 Collaborative . Our distinct NIH-funded study NYU align two jail-based opioid treatment study conduct researcher Friends Research Institute ( FRI ) Baltimore , MD , UCLA . SOMATICS seek harmonize assessment intervention across three research center ( RCs ) three independent study order leverage power , sample size , increase generalizability finding . Each RCs SOMATICS cooperative conduct individual trial , share one study arm another RC , several core assessment across site . The SOMATICS collaborative common Statistical Analysis Plan DSMP include single DSMB . The collaborative primary secondary outcome across site list : Collaborative Primary Outcome Measures : 1 . DSM-5 Opioid Use Disorder Diagnosis 30 day prior 6 month post-release follow-up assessment : Measured : DSM-5 checklist via modify CIDI-2 Substance Abuse Module . Collaborative Secondary Outcome Measures : 1 . Illicit Opioid use : measured urine drug test result 6 month post-release 2 . Number day incarcerate : Measured self-report 6 month post-release . 3 . HIV risk behavior : Measured self-report ( Drug Risk Assessment Battery [ RAB ] Needle Use score ) 6-month post-release follow-up assessment . 4 . Number day Opioids , Cocaine , Alcohol , Benzodiazepines , and/or IV Drug Use : Measured Time Line Follow Back 6 month post-release follow-up ( TLFB ; NYU , UCLA ) ASI ( FRI ) . 5 . Non-opioid drug use ( Cocaine , Amphetamines , Benzodiazepines ) : measure urine drug test 6 month post-release 6 . Number day drug abuse treatment : Measured self-report 6 month post-release . 7 . Number arrest : Measured self-report data collect 6 month post-release . 8 . Craving score ( NYU UCLA sit ) : Measured self-report crave scale 6 month post-release . 9 . Non-lethal overdose ( Yes/No ) : Measured self-report 6 month post-release . 10 . Lethal overdose ( Yes/No ) : Measured public record data review 6 month post-release . 11. WHO Quality Life-BREF ( WHOQOL-BREF ) score : Measured self-report 6 month post-release . 12 . Analyses self-same outcome 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
