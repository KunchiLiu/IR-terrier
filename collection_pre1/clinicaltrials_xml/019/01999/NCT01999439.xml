	<brief_summary>To evaluate quantitative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) potential non-invasive , radiation-free diagnostic tool evaluate esophageal wall remodeling ( thickness stiffness ) response treatment child adolescents newly diagnose eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) present dysphagia ( difficulty swallow ) food impaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EoE ( Eosinophilic Esophagitis )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) form chronic inflammation affect esophagus often result wall thicken esophageal stiffen associated complication , esophageal tear stricture ( narrowing ) . Chronic dysphagia acute food impaction ( swallow food stuck esophagus ) common symptom EoE associate esophageal wall thicken stiffness . Current diagnostic technique endoscopy biopsy give limited information change esophageal wall eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) . In routine clinical practice , repeat endoscopic evaluation biopsy commonly perform 3-6 month initial therapy eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) . However , follow-up endoscopy biopsy drawback invasive , costly typically require deep sedation general anesthesia . We propose evaluate quantitative MRI potential non-invasive diagnostic option evaluate esophageal wall remodel patient eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) .</detailed_description>
