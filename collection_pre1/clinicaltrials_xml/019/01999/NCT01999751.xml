	<brief_title>Study Monitor Patients With Pacemakers ICDs Who Undergo MRI Scans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Approach : This study prospective , non-randomized , unblinded case series patient permanent pacemaker implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) undergo medically-required MRI scanning , follow 12 month period . MRI scan perform use accept , standard protocol use FDA-approved equipment . Methods Materials : Patients enrol 60-month period Principal Investigator ( PI ) and/or Sub-Investigator ( Sub-I ) , Regional Heart Center , locate St. Mary 's Medical Center , Essentia Health , Duluth , MN , evaluations medically-required MRI scanning . Eligible patient include person permanent pacemaker ICD implant least 6 week , refer medically-required MRI scan physician participate trial . ICD generator must market release 2001 . Both pacemaker dependent non-dependent patient eligible . The primary endpoint change great 1 V pulse width 0.5 m pacemaker ICD lead time within 12 month MRI scan . On day MRI scan , pacemaker ICD interrogate programmed per usual practice Essentia Health patient undergo MRI scan device place . Three separate baseline capture threshold measurement ( V ) obtain fix pulse width 0.5 msec . Three separate baseline measurement also make lead pacing impedance ( Ohms ) sense P- R-waves ( mV ) use programmer default method . Histograms clear . Leads program bipolar modality . If patient device dependent , device program ODO/OVO/OAO mode ( monitor ) available , otherwise reprogrammed DDI VVI mode low rate 40 bpm pacing output program subthreshold level lead . If participant device dependent , device program asynchronous pace modality ( DOO/VOO ) maximum pace output . If patient ICD , therapy disable . The attend investigator may alter pace modality course scan deems necessary maximize patient safety comfort . Rate responsiveness , rate enhancement include Ventricular Rate Regulation mode , magnet mode turn . During MRI scanning , resuscitation equipment available . If participant pacemaker dependent , study PI sub-I must MRI suite scan . If participant pacemaker dependent , pacemaker nurse MRI suite perform pre- post-checks , electrophysiologist available building question troubleshoot . Patients ask report symptom include : palpitation ; pain ; heat warmth sensation ; device movement ; light-headedness . Scans perform use usual protocol standard peak Specific Absorption Rate ( SAR ) limitation scan . The MRI scan evaluate artifact create pacemaker system . During scan , continuous electrocardiographic pulse oxymetry waveform monitoring perform use usual protocol . Following scan , repeat threshold perform lead histogram obtain . Three separate capture threshold measurement ( V ) obtain immediately patient leaf scanner room fix pulse width 0.5 msec . Three separate measurement also make immediately follow scan lead pacing impedance ( Ohms ) sense P- R-waves ( mV ) use programmer default method . Participants pacemaker dependent undergo one-hour post-scan check use threshold protocol . These one-hour post scan measurement perform either pacemaker clinic patient outpatient hospital patient inpatient . Any stored event detect device electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) artifact scan may retrieve store diskette later analysis . The pacemaker ICD reprogrammed original setting prior discharge MRI suite unless attend investigator deems necessary alter device set maximize patient safety comfort . If patient ICD , capacitor reform charge time note prior dismissal MRI suite . Patients follow pacemaker clinic 3 12 month MRI scan use usual clinic protocol device follow-up . If patient undergoes second MRI scan , follow-up schedule set base upon recent MRI scan .</detailed_description>
