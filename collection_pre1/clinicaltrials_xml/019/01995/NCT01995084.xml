	<detailed_description>Background study : Several study show tumour hypoxia may negative impact outcome anticancer treatment . Assessment tumor hypoxia baseline shortly start treatment may serve predictive marker determine treatment efficacy early stage . Preferably , assessment perform vivo non-invasively.Non-invasive imaging positron emission tomography ( PET ) use 2-nitroimidazole nucleoside analogue , 3-18F-fluoro-2- ( 4- ( ( 2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl ) methyl ) -1H-1,2,3-triazol-1- yl ) propan-1-ol ( 18F-HX4 ) , test new marker tumor hypoxia . Before hypoxia-measurements clinically implement response prediction , reproducibility technique assess specific tumor type . Knowledge reproducibility need determine change parameter two examination consider relevant individual patient . Assessment reproducibility become even important early response monitoring since change tumor induced treatment may small treatment compare response monitor completion treatment . Also , image quality 18F-HX4-PET increase increase time interval injection , determination optimal time point measurement hypoxia warrant . Objective study : In study , first intend investigate optimal time point measurement hypoxia esophageal , pancreatic rectal cancer use 18F-HX4-PET assess reproducibility hypoxia measurement tumor type . Study design : In study two step take . 1 ) First , 18F-HX4-PET image quality may improve allow relatively long time interval injection , three patient esophageal , pancreatic rectal cancer 18F-HX4-PET scan perform 90 , 180 240 minute injection 18F-HX4 . The time-point best image quality ( term tumor-to-background-ratio ) chosen reproducibility study . 2 ) In second step , patient proven esophageal , pancreatic rectal cancer undergo 18F-HX4-PET twice within one week start treatment . 18F-HX4-PET perform 90 , 180 240 minute injection 18F-HX4 , depend result first part study . Reproducibility hypoxia measure 18F-HX4-PET assessed . In patient tumor tissue available treat radiation chemotherapy , level hypoxia measure 18F-HX4-PET compare endogenous hypoxia marker ( HIF1-alfa , CA9 , GLUT1 , PAI-1 , VEGF ) use immunohistochemistry . In patient underwent 18F-HX4-PET start neoadjuvant treatment , level hypoxia measure 18F-HX4-PET compare pathological response neoadjuvant treatment .</detailed_description>
