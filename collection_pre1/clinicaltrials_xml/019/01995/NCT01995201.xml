	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label study evaluate efficacy safety subcutaneously administer RoActemra/Actemra ( tocilizumab ) monotherapy combination methotrexate non-biologic DMARDs patient active rheumatoid arthritis inadequate response non-biologic DMARDs one anti-TNF . In Phase 1 , patient receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously ( sc ) weekly Weeks 1 24 , without methotrexate non-biologic DMARDs . For Part 2 , patient achieve sustain clinical DAS28-ESR remission Weeks 20 24 randomized receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg sc either weekly every 2 week Weeks 24 48 , without methotrexate non-biologic DMARDs . Patients achieve sustain clinical remission achieve low disease activity ( DAS-ESR &lt; /= 3.2 ) continue initial treatment RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg sc weekly Weeks 24 48 , without methotrexate non-biologic DMARDs .</brief_summary>
