	<brief_summary>This study phase IV post registration prospective observational feasibility study patient metastatic soft tissue sarcoma . Pazopanib register treatment patient advance soft tissue sarcoma chemotherapy doxorubicin ifosfamide . - This study look possibility use 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography PET scan early biomarker pazopanib treatment effect patient . - It also study pazopanib pharmacokinetics see difference elderly young patient . The primary objective : - To evaluate whether early metabolic response correlate clinical benefit . - To evaluate effect age ( ≥ 70 year ) pazopanib pharmacokinetics . The secondary objective : - To evaluate whether early metabolic response ( % decrease FDG uptake due pazopanib therapy ) correlate pazopanib exposure . - To evaluate whether early metabolic response ( % decrease FDG uptake due pazopanib therapy ) correlate histological subtypes .</brief_summary>
