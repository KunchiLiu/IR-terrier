	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial LAIV v TIV Vaccines Schools</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study partnership ( Public Health Agency Canada [ PHAC ] / Canadian Institutes Health Research [ CIHR ] Influenza Research Network [ PCIRN ] , Public Health Ontario [ PHO ] , PCCHU ) , support Ontario 's Ministry Health Long-Term Care [ MOHLTC ] , conduct open-label randomized trial elementary school within geographic boundary PCCHU 2013-14 influenza vaccination campaign . In order address four study objective comparison LAIV vs. TIV via SBII , use multiple methodology : questionnaire , interview , household surveillance . Overall study design PCCHU implement SBII elementary school 2000 2010 , approval Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board ( KPRDSB ) renew program upcoming influenza season ( 2013-14 ) . Ten school ( school average 300 student ) recruit participate study . The school randomize 1:1 basis ( i.e. , five school arm ) student offer ( cost ) 0.2 mL LAIV 0.5 mL TIV SBII clinic organize PCCHU . Intervention ( LAIV ) : Healthy child adolescent Junior Kindergarten ( JK ) Grade 8 intervention school immunize LAIV ( FluMist influenza vaccine ) recommend 2013-14 influenza season . A 0.2 ml dose vaccine administer intranasally . TIV also available child whose parent decline LAIV would still like child immunize influenza , child , accord 2012-13 NACI recommendation , contraindication LAIV : severe asthma ( define currently oral high-dose inhaled glucocorticosteroids active wheeze ) medically attend wheeze 7 day prior vaccination ; receive aspirin aspirin-containing therapy association Reye 's syndrome aspirin wild-type influenza infection ; immune-compromising condition due underlie disease and/or therapy , vaccine contains live attenuate virus . Control ( TIV ) : Healthy child adolescent JK Grade 8 school assign TIV immunized inactivate influenza vaccine ( Vaxigrip vaccine ) recommend 2013-14 influenza season . A 0.5 ml dose vaccine administer intramuscularly . Children one follow contraindication , accord NACI recommendation , eligible vaccination TIV : anaphylactic reaction previous dose ; anaphylactic reaction vaccine component , exception egg ; Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome ( GBS ) within six week previous influenza vaccination . Children either arm study young 9 year age previously receive influenza vaccine require two dos ; follow dose administered school , give reminder letter inform parent/guardian second dose receive healthcare setting include family physician 's office community-based public health clinic , four week first dose per influenza immunization recommendation . For purpose study , vaccine offer child enrol participate school ; group school staff , student ' parent sibling may obtain TIV cost setting list LAIV physician pharmacy ( pay privately ) . Objective 1 : To determine whether offer LAIV vs. TIV via SBII lead high vaccine coverage Study design : A web-based questionnaire send parents/guardians student participate school contact information , ask , among question , vaccination status child , child vaccinate , occur . Study procedure : All parents/guardians provide email address contact January 2014 via email invitation complete online ( paper-based , preferable ) Parents ' Vaccination Questionnaire behalf child . Prior begin questionnaire , parent/guardian access screen describe purpose questionnaire , data collect , . They also inform question ( except whether child vaccinate , influenza vaccine ) optional , completion questionnaire implies consent . The questionnaire include question student demographic , presence chronic condition important risk factor influenza , receipt influenza vaccine previous influenza season , receipt influenza vaccine outside school setting ( e.g. , doctor 's office , pharmacy , PCCHU community-based clinic ) current influenza season . We also request health card number permission future linkage provincial health administrative data set house Institute Clinical Evaluative Sciences ( ICES ) ass healthcare utilization , order determine TIV LAIV associate few physician emergency room visit . In case health card number provide incorrect , first last name , sex , birthdate student use linkage . In April 2014 , questionnaire sent parents/guardians child , base questionnaire send January , receive influenza vaccine , capture anyone whose vaccination status change January April , also provide another opportunity parent yet complete questionnaire . After email questionnaire web link send January April 2014 , two email reminder send next three week . For parents/guardians provide phone number study team , RA also remind telephone complete questionnaire . Outcome : The number student school Parents ' Vaccination Questionnaire complete serve denominator vaccine coverage measurement , number student receive LAIV TIV questionnaire complete parent/guardian serve numerator . Separate estimate vaccine coverage calculate healthy child chronic condition place elevate risk serious influenza infection . As secondary measure immunization rate , use vaccination data obtain PCCHU begin January 2014 , number dos ( vaccine type ) give school-based clinic ( numerator ) . We ask principal number student school November 1 , 2013 , use denominator . Sample size : To calculate sample size require detect 10 % increase coverage LAIV compare TIV ( i.e. , primary outcome ) , use sample size calculation two proportion base 80 % power alpha level 0.05 ( two-sided ) . The unit randomization school level unit analysis individual student school . To account cluster effect school , inflated sample size 20 % ( i.e. , variance inflation factor ) , result sample size 451 students/group . We anticipate adequate sample size since need response rate 30 % ( 902/3000 ) , hope incentive response rate 70 % . Data analysis : Bivariate analysis statistical significance continuous variable perform use two-tailed Student 's t-tests . Proportions compare use Chi-Square test Fisher 's exact test . We identify predictor outcome ( vaccinate ) use stepwise regression method . To account cluster effect school , use generalize estimating equation mixed model determine statistical significance continuous dichotomous variable adjust covariates interaction term . The exposure interest vaccine type ( LAIV TIV ) . The null hypothesis reject fix probability type I error 0.05 type II error 0.20 . Two-tailed probability distribution use statistical analysis unless specify . Variables exclude model lead complete separation data , &gt; 10 % miss value , exhibit collinearity , observation one group . We also examine residual identify model assumption invalid affected influential observation . We use STATA version 10.0 ( 2007 , StataCorp , LP , College Station , TX ) analyze data . Objective 2 : To assess acceptance administer LAIV vs. TIV via SBII base school administrator , public health , parent/guardian perception Study design : In order ass perception LAIV TIV SBII program , interview school management staff , public health manager , administer questionnaire parents/guardians student participate school . Inclusion/exclusion criterion : Interviewees must member management staff ( principal , vice principal ) participating school , PCCHU manager immunization nurse , involve aspect coordination SBII clinic . The Parents ' Vaccination Questionnaire use gauge parental perception different vaccine type , administer parents/guardians contact information , regardless whether child vaccinate . Study procedure : - Interviews school management staff immediately follow SBII clinic day understand experience coordinate program , facilitators/barriers continue existence , also experiences/interactions parent regard program . The Information Letter preliminary interview guide outline Appendices H I . These interview take place telephone November December , 2013 . - Interviews public health immunization staff ( manager ( ) nurse ) gauge perception program , administration LAIV vs. TIV , base logistical factor include time coordinate program , communication parent , staff time . These interview schedule take place November December , 2013 ; however , public health staff unavailable time due conduct vaccination clinic , conduct telephone interview January 2014 instead . - Questions related parent/guardian experience SBII clinic , well perception LAIV vs. TIV , specifically regard safety , effectiveness , acceptability ( invasiveness , concern administration , adverse event , etc . ) , include Parents ' Vaccination Questionnaire . Outcome : The outcome study component stakeholder ( school staff , public health , parent ) perception LAIV TIV SBII program , specific coordination , facilitators/barriers , overall experience . Sample size : We anticipate interview approximately one principal vice-principal 10 school , well five PCCHU manager staff member . However , number interview conduct stakeholder group ultimately base number individual involve plan SBII clinic ; therefore , few interview may conduct , appropriate . The Parents ' Vaccination Questionnaire use gauge parental perception different vaccine type , administer parents/guardians contact information . Data analysis : The interview import qualitative analysis software ( N-Vivo Version 10.0 ) aid data organization , review , cod , analysis , facilitate exploration theme emerge data . Themes analyze type vaccine give , factor include school 's population size . At least two team member read transcript get overall sense data , identify major topic issue data . Consensus decision-making use need arrive mutually agreed-upon coding . We use two-proportion z-test compare proportion parents/guardians child LAIV group child TIV group , base perception vaccine safety effectiveness , overall preference vaccine type . We also assess outcome parents/guardians vaccinate child season . To account multiple comparison , adjust p value use Benjamini-Hochberg 's method control false discovery rate ( FDR ) , control number comparison falsely declare significant . Objective 3 : To compare cost associated deliver LAIV vs. TIV via SBII Study design : To obtain cost data associate coordination LAIV TIV SBII program , principal participate school immunization program manager PCCHU interview . Inclusion/exclusion criterion : We use criterion , Objective 2 , since cost data obtain interview . Study process : During interview school board school management staff , public health manager , ask cost associate administer LAIV TIV , include limited training cost , equipment cost , staff resource use ( nursing time coordinate campaign , communication parents/guardians , delivery vaccine post-vaccination monitoring , well data entry clerk time , appropriate ) . Outcome : The outcome component study cost PCCHU , participate school , MOHLTC incur order deliver LAIV TIV SBII program . Sample size : We anticipate interview approximately one principal vice-principal 10 school , well immunization program manager PCCHU . However , may need conduct additional few interview , depend many individual able provide u cost data . Objective 4 : To inform future RCT evaluate direct indirect benefit ( protection influenza ) LAIV vs. TIV via SBII Study design : From 10 study school , 25 vaccinated student household participate Household Surveillance Study , involve surveillance laboratory-confirmed influenza 2013-2014 influenza season , assess effect LAIV TIV influenza incidence . The purpose component generate parameter estimate ( e.g. , incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza , intraclass correlation ) inform future RCT . Inclusion/exclusion criterion : Households eligible Household Surveillance Study : ) include child vaccinated influenza one 10 school-based clinic ; ( ii ) household member consent/assent participate . However , state , maintain inclusion criterion ( ii ) feasible . Additionally , student select school must receive vaccine school assign ( e.g. , student LAIV-assigned school must receive LAIV ) . Study procedure : Once consent/assent obtain household , HRA also collect record baseline data household member , include demographic , risk factor status , current influenza vaccination status . We collect information able describe baseline characteristic population , report standard basis scientific publication . In addition , need control demographic risk factor variable analyze trend data , good compare effect type vaccine . Each individual ask baseline question turn , private , help encourage honesty . Each household provide either paper electronic diary record daily symptom well digital thermometer ( taught use ) . They also supply Copan flock nasal swab , taught HRA self-swab nasally . Participating household ask : . Complete daily diary record whether household member cold , influenza , acute respiratory illness symptom , illness history ( e.g. , hospitalization relate low respiratory tract infection pneumonia , physician visit respiratory illness ) , medical history ( e.g. , medication use ) , miss day school work due acute respiratory infection . The diary available paper electronic form . ii . Have household member exhibit one three symptom influenza ( cough , sore throat , fever ) least two related symptom perform intranasal self-swab soon symptom appear ( within 48 hour ) , call Research Assistant ( RA ) . Data collection Household Surveillance study begin weekly percentage test positive influenza Peterborough area ( test via PHO ) exceed 5 % , end date weekly percentage test positive influenza Peterborough area fall 5 % , indicate end 2013-14 influenza season . Once study begin , RA contact household let know start record data daily symptom diary . For household opt paper diary , RA provide paper copy symptom diary complete daily basis . The RA contact household twice weekly telephone obtain data household member , record directly FluidSurveys . Weekly email reminder also send participate household . Those household opt electronic diary receive daily link patient diary FluidSurveys . This email sent main contact household , fill form household member . The SRC monitor diary entry , entry submit household three consecutive day , RA call household remind complete diary . If individual experience least two cold influenza symptom one three specific symptom influenza [ cough , sore throat , fever ] ) , SRC let RA know contact individual : ) remind self-swab ; ii ) arrange household visit take nasal swab individual within 48 hour symptom onset ( report individual ) . Thus two swab per episode . A repeat swab collect 7 day collection initial swab ( indicate new episode ) individual least one additional symptom , well initial 2 symptom ; individual least two new symptom ( different initial two symptom first two resolve ) . The RAs collect nasal swab household visit , transport regional laboratory Peterborough , store freezer transport central laboratory Toronto test take place . At end study , RA request parent/guardian participate household complete Parents ' Vaccination Questionnaire child , yet do . Sample size : The Household Surveillance study include 25 vaccinated student household , 10 participating school . The student must vaccinate SBII clinic school . Laboratory testing : The specimen test mean reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay detect presence influenza A B virus . We estimate primary secondary attack rate , base proportion household contact influenza develop ( determine RT-PCR assay ) , well rate acute respiratory illness . PHO regional laboratory Peterborough specimens drop send along routine clinical specimen central laboratory Toronto PCR test . We test specimen batch since real-time result require purpose study . We culture specimens test positive influenza PCR explore strain identification National Microbiological Laboratory future date . Data analysis : To calculate influenza incidence among household member , count first infection specific influenza type/subtype ( i.e. , A/H3N2 , A/H1N1 , B ) numerator ( age-specific ) , denominator age-specific uninfected person-days . If participant swab within 14 day , virus detect one occasion time frame , first episode detect used analysis . This calculated influenza non-influenza virus . We calculate incidence use event per 1000 person-days estimate difference rate assume Poisson distribution .</detailed_description>
