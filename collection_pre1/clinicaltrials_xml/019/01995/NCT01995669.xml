	<brief_title>Lenalidomide GA101 Relapsed Indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Three ( 3 ) group 6 participant enrol Phase 1 portion study . Up 60 participant enrol Phase 2 . If enrolled Phase 1 portion , dose lenalidomide receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level lenalidomide . Each new group receive high dose lenalidomide group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose lenalidomide find . If enrolled Phase 2 portion , receive lenalidomide high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level obinutuzumab . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . You give drug diary record dose . On Days 2-22 Cycles 1-6 , take lenalidomide mouth time daily . You take glass water either full empty stomach . Do break , chew , open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day . Do take double regular dose make miss dose . If take prescribe dose lenalidomide , seek emergency medical care need contact study staff right away . You receive obinutuzumab vein Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 2-6 . The first infusion last 4 hour . If well-tolerated , next infusion take 4-5 hour . If stable disease continue receive obinutuzumab lenalidomide 12 cycle . There `` rest period '' . Participants move extend dose schedule Cycle 6 , dose obinutuzumab give every cycle . Extended Dosing : If respond , may begin take obinutuzumab Day 1 every even cycle ( Cycles 8 , 10 , 12 ) . You may continue take lenalidomide Cycle 12 . Study Visits : Some test procedure may do 7 day time list . On Day 1 cycle Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) pregnancy test . - On Day 1 , complete physical exam . If doctor think need , Day 14 Cycles 2-12 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 every 4 month : - You CT PET/CT check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug 30 month . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 28 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - You CT and/or PET/CT check status disease . - You chest x-ray check status disease . - If doctor think need bone marrow biopsy aspiration check status disease . - Blood ( 2 ½ tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) pregnancy test . Depending disease status , many test help check status disease . The exact test need would doctor . Your doctor discus . Long-term Follow-up : If stop take study drug disease get bad , study doctor follow check every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month next year , every year . At clinic visit : - You CT scan and/or PET/CT check status disease . - You physical exam . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA approve treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Obinutuzumab FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Its use study investigational . The combination lenalidomide obinutuzumab investigational . Up 72 participant enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
