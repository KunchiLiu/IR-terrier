	<brief_summary>The common form injection use treatment degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis ( DLSS ) patient neurogenic claudication ( NC ) caudal inter-laminar epidural injection anesthetic steroid . Unilateral transforaminal epidural steroid injection ( TESI ) also use alleviate patient ' symptom NC DLSS , particularly patient whose level stenosis L4-5 higher . However , unilateral injection cross midline , case low extremity pain symptom side , bilateral TESI would probably beneficial . To date , well design prospective study determine effectiveness bilateral TESI level stenosis DLSS patient NC . Therefore , goal prospective , non-randomized case-series outcome study evaluate effectiveness BTESI alleviating symptom NC , well improve function patient DLSS . The hypothesis BTESI level stenotic segment central canal lumbar spine decrease symptom NC improve function patient DLSS .</brief_summary>
