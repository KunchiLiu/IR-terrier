	<brief_summary>Fanconi anemia rare autosomal sex link recessive genetic disease . The disease characterize bone marrow hematopoiesis failure , multiple congenital abnormality , susceptibility neoplastic disease . The cell FA patient extremely sensitive MMC DEB . The symptom age FA patient different , compare exome FA patient parent , mutation accumulate FA patient could find , gene might sensitive repairment important hematopoiesis maintainance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heterogeneity FA . In research animal model , phenotype FANCA , FANCC FANCG knockout mouse similar . They grow develop normally , without severe blood disease tumor . However , show chromosome instablity highly sensitivity MMC . And gonadal dysfunction fertility defect . From conclude severe physical deformity FA patient might induce mutation . By compare among FA patient FA patiens normal people , look forward find mutated gene verify relationship physical deformity . Even 90 % FA patient bone marrow failure eventually occur , start age range 8-84 . And Immuno-inhibition therapy effect FA . Other DNA repair dysfunction diseases high rate tumor , high rate bone marrow failure FA , imply FA protein key role hematopoietic stem cell maintainance . In FancC-/- mouse , young mouse insensitive DNA crosslinks comet assay , adult mouse , indicate accumulation DNA damage time lead DNA repairment defect . compare exome FA patient parent , mutation accumulate FA patient could find , gene might sensitive repairment important hematopoiesis maintainance .</detailed_description>
