	<brief_summary>This two arm , open-labelled phase II randomise trial Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) metastatic melanoma patient give precondition chemotherapy Interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) . Eligible patient undergo surgical tumour excision TIL derive , culture expand . Patients receive precondition chemotherapy cyclophosphamide ( 60mg/kg ) day -7 day -6 , follow fludarabine ( 25mg/m2 ) day -5 day -1 . The autologous TILs re-infused day 0 patient receive 12 dos intravenous High Dose Interleukin-2 ( HD-IL2 ) Low Dose Interleukin-2 ( LD-IL2 ) depend randomise arm . The primary objective response rate assess compare CT scan carry week 6 , week 12 12 weekly interval thereafter evaluation feasibility tolerability TIL therapy HD-IL2 versus LD-IL2 .</brief_summary>
