	<brief_summary>Endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration useful tool diagnosis stag pancreatic cancer . One potential limitation contamination needle traverse gastrointestinal tract continuous negative pressure . Gastrointestinal tract contamination lead misinterpretation FNA specimens . We propose technique eliminate remain negative pressure EUS-FNA therefore decrease gastrointestinal tract contamination . Our hypothesis briefly untwisting syringe biopsy channel specimen obtain eliminates remain negative pressure FNA needle therefore reduces GI tract contamination EUS-FNA specimen , lead improve diagnostic accuracy important clinical technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simple Technique Improve Diagnostic Yield EUS-FNA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) evolve minimally invasive diagnostic staging method . The addition fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) increase accuracy EUS diagnosis stag pancreatic malignancy . An ultrasound probe attach end endoscope allow real-time direct visualization mean ultrasound transmission . During FNA process needle advance biopsy channel endoscope target lesion . In order obtain tissue specimen suspicious pancreatic lesion , FNA needle must traverse either stomach duodenum access pancreatic mass . Once needle enter target lesion syringe exchange needle stylet negative pressure apply allow acquisition cytology specimen . Negative pressure release syringe stop cock close syringe . However , due relatively long length needle significant remain negative pressure needle tip . This lead aspiration surround material include GI mucosal contamination needle remove target lesion . Contamination FNA specimen gastric duodenal epithelium occur continue negative pressure needle tip upon withdrawal needle target lesion . While EUS-FNA high specificity ( 96 % ) , sensitivity ( 87 % ) , accuracy ( 94 % ) , gastrointestinal tract contamination lead misinterpretation FNA specimens . Based clinical experience , propose technique eliminate remain negative pressure EUS-FNA therefore decrease gastrointestinal tract contamination .</detailed_description>
