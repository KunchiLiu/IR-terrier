	<detailed_description>H7N9 AI viruses recently cause large outbreak severe respiratory disease human China . A vaccine use event H7N9 AI pandemic important research priority . Previous study show subject receive live bird flu vaccine receive subsequent `` booster '' dose inactivated bird flu vaccine , vigorous antibody response detect . The inactivated vaccine serve way probe immune response initial live vaccine . The purpose study evaluate safety , infectivity , immunogenicity live attenuate H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine healthy adult , administer booster dose inactivate subvirion H7N9 influenza vaccine 3 month later . This study enroll healthy adult willing remain isolation unit inpatient clinic several day study . They randomly assign receive either one dose ( Group 1 ) two dos ( Group 2 ) live attenuate H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine , deliver nasal spray device . Participants group receive one `` booster '' dose inactivated subvirion H7N9 influenza vaccine 3 month later outpatient set . All participant admit inpatient clinic receive one dose live attenuate H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine 2 day enter clinic . Participants remain inpatient clinic approximately 9 day receive vaccine . While clinic , participant undergo medical history review , blood collection , urine collection , physical examination , nasal wash procedure , vital sign measurement . Participants Group 1 attend study visit Day 28 undergo medical history review , blood collection , nasal wash . Participants Group 2 readmitted inpatient clinic 2 day prior receive second dose live attenuate H7N9 A/Anhui/13 ca influenza virus vaccine Day 28 . They remain clinic approximately 9 day receive vaccine ; clinic , take part study procedure first inpatient visit . All participant attend study visit Day 56 undergo medical history review , blood collection , nasal wash. At Day 98 , participant receive one `` booster '' dose inactivated subvirion H7N9 influenza vaccine , outpatient . They attend additional study visit Days 101 , 105 , 112 , 126 , 154 , 180 , may include medical history review ; physical examination ; urine , blood , nasal secretion collection .</detailed_description>
