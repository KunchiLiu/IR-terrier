By rapid technical development last year small flexible video endoscope develop allow also alternative access upper GI-tract via nose ( transnasal access ) . Patients dysphagia referred physician different discipline ( gastroenterology , surgery , ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) medicine , radiology , neurology ) perform variety endoscopic non-endoscopic technique . Mostly , endoscopic examination esophagus do sedate patient left lateral examination . Typical finding esophagoscopy might tumor , stricture , achalasia diverticulum . Patients suffer neurogenic dysphagia often get catch trap : find somewhere space gastroenterologist , neurologist , ENT-specialist radiologist . This dilemma might due lack pathophysiological knowledge among many physician inability directly visualize esophageal phase deglutition . In sedated patient lie leave lateral position , endoscopists may receive limited impression function different phase swallow since endoscopic access rather static one . The focus observational study patient suspect neurogenic dysphagia . These patient shall examine transnasal endoscopy apply ultrathin video endoscope outer diameter 3.8 mm ( BF-3C160 , Olympus Europe ) . Patients examine sit position ingest water food different consistency ( functional endoscopy ) . Diagnostic shall complete correlated videofluoroscopy , high-resolution manometry assessment clinical sign . Beside feasibility safety primary endpoint , secondary endpoint shall assessment pathologic endoscopic finding patient suffer neurogenic dysphagia .
