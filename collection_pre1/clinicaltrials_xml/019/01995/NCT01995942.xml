	<brief_summary>Extramural venous invasion ( EMVI ) spread microscopic tumour cell vein around tumour . Rectal cancer treatment improve greatly recent year . However , important u learn much tumour possible order develop new therapy . Current treatment may benefit new genetic information relate cancer . We hope identify genetic difference certain type rectal cancer allow future treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) widely accept beneficial select patient term decrease risk local recurrence overall survival . Current management rectal cancer involve risk stratification pre-operative stag leading formulation treatment strategy . Very little known long-term outcome response CRT MRI detect extramural venous invasion ( mrEMVI ) . Although mrEMVI accept marker poor prognosis , whether predictive value specifically treat know . Molecular genetic profiling provide u opportunity understand underlie mechanism govern clinical behaviour rectal cancer . Using high-throughput technology tissue microarray analysis allow large-scale analysis specimen relatively short amount time . It offer ability compare molecular profile different subtypes rectal cancer mrEMVI-positive -negative tumour whether change observe follow CRT . This correlated clinical behaviour medium long-term regard local recurrence , distant metastasis overall survival . This study identify important difference key rectal cancer tumour subtypes . Identification reliable pathological marker EMVI pathway ( primary tumour sample , importantly pre-operative biopsy ) real potential take u step closer personalised management rectal cancer establish prognostic biomarkers reflective disease type , also underlie biology may highlight ( promise therapeutic translation ) .</detailed_description>
