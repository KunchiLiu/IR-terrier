	<brief_title>A Smartphone Application Evaluate Energy Expenditure Duration Activities Free-living Conditions ( eMouve2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow interest evaluate physical activity energy expenditure ( EE ) provide feedback user . The use mass-market sensor accelerometers offer promise solution general public due grow smartphone market last decade . Thus , propose EE estimation function create use accelerometry data collect 10 volunteer equip smartphone two research sensor ( Armband Actiheart ) use estimate EE several control activity . The research sensor ' data serf reference creation evaluation propose function . It evaluate data 6 volunteer free-living condition previous eMouve project . eMouve2 consist acquire data 24 new volunteer order validate function free-living condition . This EE estimation function use smartphone technology dedicate light- moderate-intensity activity , believe new way help people control daily physical activity level .</detailed_description>
