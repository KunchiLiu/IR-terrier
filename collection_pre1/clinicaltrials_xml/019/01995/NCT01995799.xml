	<brief_summary>Ferumoxytol example 'smart ' magnetic resonance contrast agent consist ultrasmall superparamagnetic particle iron oxide ( USPIOs ) avidly take macrophage . Through previous work , investigator establish USPIOs identify inflammation wall abdominal aortic aneurysm associate three-fold increase rate aneurysm growth . The utility ferumoxytol image cardiovascular inflammation area body yet establish Dr Alam establish uptake USPIOs penumbra infarct zone myocardium patient recent myocardial infarction . The investigator wish ass USPIO uptake patient recent acute myocardial infarction identify time course determinant cellular tissue inflammation . This first clinical study examine ability USPIOs image myocardial inflammation follow acute myocardial infarction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Coronary atherosclerosis responsible initiation acute myocardial infarction plaque rupture lead acute coronary thrombosis myocardial infarction . Current treatment acute phase involve re-establishing vessel patency percutaneous coronary intervention support anti-thrombotic therapy . Thereafter , statins , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor beta-blockade prognostic benefit treatment successfully develop target post-infarction inflammatory pathway . Necrotic cardiac muscle elicits inflammatory cascade serf clear infarct dead cell matrix debris . Human cardiac muscle negligible regenerative capacity ultimately inflammation lead replacement damage tissue fibrotic scar . Enhancing reparative mechanism follow inflammatory reaction myocardial infarction may reduce cardiomyocyte injury , attenuate adverse remodelling improve clinical outcome . A good understanding early post-infarct healing phase also facilitate cell therapy strategy engraft stem cell stimulate regeneration . In order achieve goal , investigator must better characterise inflammatory process follow infarction myocardial necrosis human . Inflammatory cell mediate injury healing infarcted myocardium Neutrophils Inflammation within infarcted myocardium associate induction endothelial adhesion molecule enhance permeability microvasculature . Up regulation chemokines include interleukin ( IL ) -8 monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 attract neutrophils monocyte site injury . Early reperfusion therapy amplify inflammatory cell influx accelerate heal response proliferative maturation phase . Neutrophil adhesion endothelium infarcted myocardium occurs within minute reperfusion . Ischaemic cardiomyocytes injured adherent neutrophil release reactive oxygen specie destructive protease include human neutrophil elastase ( HNE ) proteinase 3 . HNE wide range substrate include matrix component elastin , fibronectin , collagen type III IV . Activated neutrophil also occlude microvessels increase endothelial permeability contribute myocardial oedema . Capillary plug obstruction activate neutrophil contribute failure microvascular perfusion increase infarct size within 'no-reflow ' zone . Neutrophil depletion reduces phenomenon infarct size follow reperfusion pre-clinical model . Monocyte-derived Macrophages Recruitment monocytes infarcted myocardium follow maturation differentiation macrophage : process dependent growth factor macrophage-colony stimulating factor ( M-CSF ) . Macrophages multiple role within infarct include ( ) phagocytic clearance dead cell debris , ( ii ) production growth factor cytokines stimulate fibroblast growth angioneogenesis , ( iii ) matrix turnover production matrix metalloproteases inhibitor . Macrophages resident within 24 h infarction persist 4 week . During period , macrophage regulate infarct heal initial development granulation tissue subsequent scar formation . Murine study suggest distinct monocyte subset regulate different process . Monocytes arrive within first 3 day mature macrophage scavenge necrotic debris inflammatory mediator expression , proteolysis phagocytosis monocytes arrive later give rise macrophage promote reparative process angioneogenesis extracellular matrix deposition . Apoptosis primary mechanism determine longevity neutrophil within site inflammation infarction . Engulfment clearance apoptotic neutrophil macrophage produce potent anti-inflammatory signal include release transform growth factor ( TGF ) -β . Combined clearance pro-inflammatory matrix fragment , process drive switch tissue repair resolution post-infarct inflammatory response . MCP-1 expression increase ischaemic myocardium follow reperfusion account substantial proportion monocyte chemotactic activity . MCP-1 knockout mouse exhibit delay macrophage infiltration heal infarct prolong inflammatory phase delay replacement injured cardiomyocytes granulation tissue . The MCP-1 deficient mouse similar size infarct attenuate remodelling compare wild type . MCP-1 mRNA level increase 40-fold within non-infarcted myocardium blockade MCP-1 signal deletion mutant MCP-1 markedly reduce macrophage infiltration within infarct non-infarcted myocardium . Widespread myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration beyond non-infarcted zone observe human autopsy specimen . Blockade MCP-1 signalling associate improved survival rate reduce left ventricular dilatation well reduce tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α gene expression non-infarcted myocardium . These study indicate macrophage activity outside infarct zone may contribute adverse myocardial remodelling follow myocardial infarction . The inflammatory response myocardial infarction necessarily complex coordinate development heal scar infarcted tissue . The role macrophage differs depend differentiation location within myocardium . Therapeutic manipulation heal process come understanding mechanism target reparative pathway . Indiscriminate immunosuppressive therapy setting may result harm observe trial methylprednisolone acute myocardial infarction . Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tracking Cellular Inflammation Iron oxide particle use contrast medium magnetic resonance imaging since alter magnetic property relaxation tissue application radiofrequency pulse . Such contrast medium consist iron oxide core within dextran coat . They classify `` superparamagnetic iron oxide particle '' ( SPIOs ) consist particle 30 nm diameter , `` ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particle '' ( USPIOs ) 30 nm diameter . USPIOs take cell liver , spleen , bone marrow lymph node . They capacity extravasate capillary phagocytosed tissue inflammatory cell reticuloendothelial system . These cell predominately macrophage , neutrophil also show take USPIOs . This model USPIO-enhanced MRI highlight area inflammation model vertebral osteomyelitis , aortic atherosclerosis , arthritis-induced hyperperfusion , autoimmune encephalomyelitis , nephritis nephropathy , cerebral ischaemia renal ischaemia . Pilot Data Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction The investigator undertake preliminary proof-of-concept study examine possibility use USPIOs image myocardium patient sustain recent acute myocardial infarction . To date , investigator study 16 patient follow ST segment elevation myocardial infarction treat reperfusion therapy undertaken serial magnetic resonance imaging scan . By undertake T2* map myocardium 24-h USPIO administration , investigator calculate R2* value ( inverse T2* ) represent colour-coded R2* map . This demonstrate 2-3 fold increase R2* value infarct peri-infarct area . As negative control , investigator observe little change R2* value myocardium remote site ischaemia skeletal muscle . The liver demonstrate marked uptake USPIOs 3-4 fold increase R2* value .</detailed_description>
