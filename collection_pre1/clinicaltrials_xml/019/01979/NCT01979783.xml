	<brief_summary>Transversus abdominis ( TrA ) lumbar multifidus ( LM ) muscle propose play key role stability lumbosacral spine . The muscle ' functional and/or structural deficit link low back pain ( LBP ) syndrome . Evaluation transversus abdominis lumbar multifidus muscle ' function clinical practice scarce well define due number reason . Surface electromyography TrA LM muscle , method examine muscle function , involved clinical routine . Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging ( RUSI ) TrA LM , apart provide information morphology , could helpful assess function . Since concentric muscle contraction result shorten thicken muscle , evaluation potential association muscle 's morphometry , assess ultrasound , electromyography , may potential clinical interest . However , potential relationship context-dependant . Our aim establish difference thickness change TrA LM muscle activation subject without low back pain , establish possible correlation electromyography thickness change muscle assess ultrasound group subject .</brief_summary>
