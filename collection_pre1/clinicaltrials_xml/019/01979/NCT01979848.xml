	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence sexual dysfunction potential side effect men undergo successful removal cancerous prostate via surgery . Hypothermic cool via investigational Endorectal Cooling Balloon show group significantly reduce long term urinary incontinence may reduce sexual dysfunction men robotic prostatectomy , improve patient 's long term quality life ( QOL ) . However successful translation endorectal balloon proceed world wide usage , must understand : 1 . How effectively tissue continence sexual function cool within pelvis . 2 . What capacity vascularize structure ( i.e . neurovascular bundle ) 'cool sink ' diminish effective cool 3 . Determine endorectal balloon re‐designed improved QOL outcomes men . This research study marries two new technique Thermal MRI image Endorectal cool prostate cancer surgery . MRI non‐invasive . A simple confirmation effective hypothermic cooling achieve novel MRI thermal map cool gradient comprehensively sweeps rectum across urogenital pelvis . MRI temperature adaptive software accurately map gradient non‐invasive technique , answer formidable question effectiveness hypothermic cooling prostate direct translation improve continence sexual function surgery . The purpose research study use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Thermal MRI subject receive investigational endorectal cool balloon help understand cool balloon work , may translate us future , include diagnosis patient high risk develop prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer second frequent cause cancer death men account 11 % male cancer . Radical prostatectomy remain gold standard localize disease , offer advantage precise stag grade real possibility disease eradication . In US approximately 100,000 radical prostatectomy ( RP ) perform prostate cancer annually . However , two major challenge quality life outcome radical prostatectomy : preserving urinary continence , sexual function . The quality life ( QOL ) radical prostatectomy relies return continence sexual function surgery pre‐operative 'normal ' status . The main factor determine potency rate patient whether nerve Neurovascular Bundles ( NVB ) , spar , may take year sexual function return . This may due nerve injury nerve trauma surgical procedure . Similarly , major factor involve post‐radical prostatectomy incontinence preservation nerve control external urethral sphincter , bladder , urogenital diaphragm . Also Inflammation surgical removal prostate affect nerve , also may directly damage bladder , urethra , pelvic floor . Effective strategy prevent damage currently lack . One stratagem prevent minimize damage , use local hypothermia ice cold irrigation around nerve tissue prior , , injury occur . In numerous experimental model central peripheral nervous system injury , use moderate hypothermia ( i.e . 28‐33oC ) show provide dramatic neuroprotection safely human , cardiac , kidney , brain surgery many year .</detailed_description>
