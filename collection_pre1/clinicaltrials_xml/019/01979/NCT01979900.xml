	<brief_summary>Mycobacterium Vaccae Injection ( Trade Name `` Vaccae '' ) kind bio-products develop Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co. , Ltd. , get `` The New Drug Certificate `` 1999 . Vaccae approve adjuvant therapy tuberculosis ( TB ) , also recommend drug TB immunotherapy WHO . It approve production sale Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co. , Ltd . 2001 , get favourable comment therapy tuberculosis . The purpose study add new indication Vaccae , mainly prevent Tuberculosis high risk group Tuberculosis Infection . In December 2012 , China Food Drug Administration approve plan `` Phase III Clinical Study Efficacy Safety Mycobacterium Vaccae Prevent Tuberculosis high risk group Tuberculosis Infection '' . In test , 10,000 case whose skin test PPD strongly positive enrol . Using random , double-blind , placebo-controlled method , study carry evaluate efficacy safety Vaccae prevent Tuberculosis . Meanwhile , test , TB incidence degree pathological change experimental group lower control group , drug-related SAEs report treatment group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase III Clinical Study Efficacy Safety Vaccae™ Prevent Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Main Purpose Study : - Evaluation efficacy Vaccae prevent Tuberculosis high risk group Tuberculosis Infection . The Secondary Purpose Study : - Evaluation Lesion Degree ( Bacteriology Indicators , Cavity ) patient relationship Skin Test result TB-PPD Injection Vaccae high risk group . - Evaluation Changes Humoral Immunity Cellular Immunologic Response Before After Injection Vaccae Test Hypothesis : In test , TB incidence degree pathological change experimental group lower control group , drug-related SAEs report treatment group Blinding Random : Using random , double-blind , placebo-controlled method , evaluation efficacy safety Vaccae . Using block randomization method , random sequence generate statistic personnel Fourth Military Medical University Clinical Evaluation Center use SAS9.1.3 statistical software The Unblinding include first time Unblinding second time Unblinding . The first time Unblinding distinguish group , second time Unblinding uncover final Blind Codes . The Blind Codes design produce one time , unblinding carry respectively first year second year begin experiment .</detailed_description>
