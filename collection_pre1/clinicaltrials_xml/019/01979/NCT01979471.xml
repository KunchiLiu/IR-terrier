	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( disease heart blood vessel ) one lead cause death Canada . It also carry financial burden Canadian economy yearly cost close $ 21 billion divide loss productivity healthcare cost . The majority cardiovascular disease case ( 90 % ) cause factor control modify . These factor include high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes ( high blood sugar ) , tobacco smoking , unhealthy diet , obesity , physical inactivity high alcohol consumption . Such factor common well controlled individual factor would risk cardiovascular disease . As control factor reduce risk cardiovascular disease improve individual ' quality life . Pharmacists frequently work patient family doctor provide cardiovascular care . Having pharmacist involve cardiovascular care may help patient cardiovascular disease risk disease accessible may opportunities educate people cardiovascular medication . This might lead good prevention control cardiovascular disease . Purpose : The research study ass community pharmacy cardiovascular risk reduction intervention help reduce cardiovascular risk . Procedure : If individual elevate blood pressure , cholesterol , blood sugar , waist circumference body weight physically inactive , unhealthy diet , smoker take medication previously mention condition , pharmacist ass cardiovascular disease risk [ risk cardiovascular event ( e.g . heart attack stroke ) ] use computer program . If individual high risk s/he ask take part study . If individual agrees take part study s/he randomly assign either Usual Care Group Advanced Care Group . All participant equal chance assign either group . If assign Usual Care Group , individual receive care service would normally provide pharmacist . At 3 month , pharmacist see individual offer Advanced Care time . If assign Advanced Care Group , individual ask meet pharmacist every 3-4 week 3 month period . During meeting , pharmacist conduct assessment may include blood pressure , waist circumference , height weight measurement talk individual cardiovascular risk medication . The individual pharmacist come plan try low his/her cardiovascular risk . The pharmacist discus plan family doctor . The individual ask conduct laboratory test 3 month visit ; test may include HbA1c ( blood test measure blood sugar control last 3 month ) cholesterol assess effect intervention cardiovascular risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death worldwide account nearly one third total death . The majority ( 90 % ) CVD case cause modifiable risk factor . These factor include tobacco smoking , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes , physical inactivity , high fat diet obesity . In Canada CVD rate decrease drastically last decade , yet still one leading cause death . It also carry financial burden Canadian economy cost close $ 21 billion every year divide loss productivity healthcare cost . Despite risk associated major CVD risk factor treatment advancement , prevalence still substantial North America . Treatment gap also report amongst factor . Al Hamarneh colleague ( 2012 ) report almost 50 % community dwell patient type 2 diabetes HbA1c target . Leiter colleague ( 2013 ) report almost half patient type 2 diabetes achieve HbA1c cholesterol target , slightly one third achieve blood pressure target 13 % achieve composite triple target . The guideline recommend use cardiovascular risk assessment equation guide CVD prevention management . Despite recommended guideline , integrate clinician ' daily routine ; fact majority patient attend physician ' clinic report never cardiovascular risk assessment . This indicate need new avenue patient get cardiovascular risk assess . Community pharmacists front-line primary healthcare professional see patient chronic disease frequently family physician ; , well position identify patient high risk CVD , determine CVD risk assist disease management . The efficacy pharmacist ' intervention chronic disease well demonstrated literature . Two large randomize controlled trial community pharmacy set conduct group . Both study report positive impact pharmacist intervention patient ' lipid panel blood pressure . Objectives Primary objective To evaluate effect community pharmacy-based case find intervention program patient high risk cardiovascular event reduction estimate risk major cardiovascular event . Secondary objective Clinical : - Improvements individual risk factor : LDL-cholesterol , blood pressure , HbA1c ( among patient diabetes ) , smoke cessation - Achievement recommend cholesterol , blood pressure glycemic control target - Increase proportion patient receive appropriate BP , cholesterol diabetes medication Process : - Increase number high risk patient screen cardiovascular risk - Assess efficacy various case-finding mechanism vulnerable patient population reach - Assure sustainability explore enable barrier force . Methods Design : Randomized controlled trial patient unit randomization Setting : Community pharmacists Alberta recruitment follow , engage patient family physicians Patients/Population : Inclusion criterion : Adults ( ≥18 year age ) high risk cardiovascular event , include : - Patients diabetes - Patients chronic kidney disease [ eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and/or ( ACR &gt; = 30 mg/mmol two consecutive ACR test &gt; = 3 mg/mmol ) ] - Patients establish atherosclerotic vascular disease include cerebrovascular disease ( prior stroke transient ischemic attack ) , cardiovascular disease ( myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , stable angina , revascularization ) , peripheral arterial disease ( symptomatic and/or ankle brachial index &lt; 0.9 ) . - Primary prevention patient multiple risk factor Framingham risk score &gt; 20 % - In order qualify inclusion , patient must least one uncontrolled risk factor ( i.e. , blood pressure , LDL-cholesterol , HbA1c , current smoker . Exclusion criterion : - Unwilling participate/sign consent form - Unwilling unable participate regular follow-up visit - Pregnancy Recruitment : Pharmacists pharmacy staff go use follow method recruit patient study : · Proactive recruitment case-finding facilitator ( trained pharmacy technician , assistant pharmacy/medical/nursing student focus target prescription oral hypoglycemic , anti-hypertensive lipid lower medication ) . Pharmacists check recent lab result patient course routine care . If patient eGFR proteinuria test do last 12 month he/she give request test copy send his/her family physician . If Patient meet inclusion criterion study patient ask he/she want participate study . If patient agrees participate he/she ask sign write informed consent form . After sign consent form patient enrol study . The patient 's family physician go receive letter pharmacist inform him/her his/her patient agree participate study . Randomization : Once inform write consent obtain , patient randomize ( via centralize secure website ensure allocation concealment ) 1:1 ratio either advance care usual care group Intervention : For patient randomize advanced care group pharmacist complete Comprehensive Annual Care Plan ( CACP ) Standard Medication Management Assessment ( SMMA ) , include : - Patient assessment ( blood pressure measurement accord CHEP guideline , waist circumference , weight height measurement ) - Laboratory assessment HbA1c lipid ( do within 3 month ) - Individual assessment CVD risk education risk - Calculation cardiovascular risk facilitate online tool pharmacist enters patient demographic age , gender , cholesterol , blood pressure , smoke status , diabetes , etc system use appropriate risk engine base patient 's medical history . UKPDS , International model predict recurrent cardiovascular disease Framingham use patient diabetes , previous vascular disease , CKD high Framingham risk ( &gt; 20 % ) respectively ( see appendix risk engine score sheet ) . In case patient one co-morbidity risk engine estimate high risk use - Discussion CVD risk patient use interactive online tool explain his/her individual cardiovascular risk target intervention - Proving patient education cardiovascular risk factor healthy lifestyle option - Providing treatment recommendation ( C-CHANGE date Canadian clinical practice guideline ) - Prescription adaptation ( ) , and/or prescribe necessary meet lipid , blood pressure glycemic control target smoke cessation . - Regular communication patient 's family physician contact patient use physician contact form develop research team - Regular follow-up patient minimum every 3-4 week 3 month ( Interim telephone follow-up may perform discretion pharmacist ; however telephone follow-up use 2 consecutive visit final visit ( 3 month ) . Usual care : Patients randomize usual care group receive : - Usual pharmacy care specific intervention 3 month - At end 3 month usual care period , patient cross receive advanced care outline 3 month The analysis result patient cross usual care group advance care group conduct separately design basis .</detailed_description>
