	<brief_summary>Infectious disease single big cause death worldwide . New infectious agent , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus new strain influenza continually emerge require new investigation understand pathogen biology pathogenesis host . Witness Influenza A pandemic . Concerns new virus impact health economy also increase . Current alert send Ministry Health ( novel coronavirus Avian influenza A virus ) case point . These likely reflect advance science , allow novel pathogen identify . Because geography , Singapore vulnerable new pathogen importation global travel citizen . Hence must ever ready meet unexpected challenge anytime . On administrative front , Singapore General Hospital Disease Outbreak Task-force place many plan activate large-scale epidemic . What miss thus far program enable u perform scientific study set epidemic . Hence study , , collaboration Program Emerging Infectious Diseases ( EID ) Duke-National University Singapore Postgraduate Medical School , attempt ( ) detect novel , previously undescribed pathogen ; ( ii ) characterize virus ( necessarily novel emerge re-emerging ) raise concern cause cluster epidemic hospital and/or country ; ( iii ) characterize immune response virus healthcare worker well patient ( affected virus expose affect ) . The technique use routinely available hospital 's service lab . Some patient remain undiagnosable best available technology . Since new laboratory tool detect previously undiagnosed pathogen may become available future , study also aim archive specimen patient whose illness remain undiagnosed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detect Novel Pathogens Characterize Emerging Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow aim : 1 . To detect novel , previously undescribed pathogen . 2 . To characterize virus ( necessarily novel emerge re-emerging ) raise concern cause cluster epidemic hospital and/or country ; 3 . To characterize immune response viruses patient . 4 . To archive specimen identifiable infectious etiological agent future test . A recent global analysis document emerge infectious disease event increase significantly time . Singapore spar list pathogen since late 1990s , include Nipahn virus , SARS coronavirus , dengue , chikungunya , 2009 H1N1 . As widely know , novel coronavirus may potentially impact Singapore Haj pilgrims Singapore travel Saudi Arabia potentially expose virus . Novel pathogens continue discover . An example Severe Fever Thrombocytopenia Syndrome bunyavirus Henan , China . Appropriately commentary accompany report identify China country large potential emerge re-emerging infectious disease , due close proximity animal human population . Similarly , Southeast Asia identify potential hotspot , cite avian influenza pandemic Nipahn virus outbreak . As , obvious need good define undiagnosed infective syndrome Singapore , subsequently characterize emerge pathogen . In Singapore , currently lack research focus discovery novel pathogen . Our current protocol attempt fill gap . This proposal bring together expert clinical infectious disease SGH , world renowned scientist laboratory diagnostics infectious disease public health epidemiology expert Duke-NUS Postgraduate Medical School . We hope employ state art technology , frontier new pathogen discovery .</detailed_description>
