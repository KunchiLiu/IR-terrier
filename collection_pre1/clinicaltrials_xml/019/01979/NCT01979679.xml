	<brief_summary>The purpose research study measure many dopamine receptor lurasidone occupies throughout brain patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder time period occupancy occur . This research lurasidone investigational medication yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Dopamine receptor key role many process , include control motivation , learning , fine motor movement . The degree occupancy transience occupancy D2 receptor occupancy optimal clinical response prevent relapse controversial area study address . In study Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scan perform D2/D3 ligand 18F-fallypride ( radioactive , injectable substance ) help researcher measure use receptor . Researchers hope quantify amount receptor occupy medication help determine best dose study medication term improvement least side effect relate body size gender well prevent relapse may relate hypersensitivity . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) also perform . MRI scan method make picture part brain use large magnetic field . This study use particular kind MRI call fMRI , functional MRI . fMRI take picture brain person think simple task . fMRI allow researcher investigate patient regional brain activation cognitive ( mental ) emotional task .</brief_summary>
