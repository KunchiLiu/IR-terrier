	<detailed_description>This study single-blinded RCT , whose aim evaluate effect rotation function prevention musculoskeletal disorder industrial worker Methods : Participants recruit employee textile industry . The inclusion criterion : employee age 18 65 year able read understand questionnaire . The number work hour lose due leave sick leave due illness musculoskeletal system connective tissue ( M Group International Classification Diseases , ICD-10 ) use estimate sample size . The average time lose last three month , company study conduct approximately 1,100 hour . Assume intervention enable reduction number 10 % , ie , group difference 100 lose working hour , standard deviation 250 hour . Will consider statistical power 80 % , Î±=0.05 follow-up loss 15 % . Thus , 116 worker require per group . The productive sector include study pre- stratify level exposure ergonomic risk factor . The sector similar demand group randomly divide intervention group control group . The intervention group perform rotation function , switch task low , moderate high ergonomic risk different request ergonomic body region add ergonomic guideline . The control group receive ergonomic guideline . Primary outcome : Absence work due sick leave due disease musculoskeletal system connective tissue . Secondary outcome : musculoskeletal symptom ( Nordic Questionnaire EVA ) , ergonomic risk factor ( Quick exposure Check Job Factors Questionnaire ) , psychosocial factor fatigue ( Need Recovery Scale ( NFR ) , general health status ( WHOQOL-bref ) , physical activity level ( Baecke Questionnaire ) , productivity Work Performance Questionnaire ( HPQ ) cost ( incremental cost effectiveness ratio ) . Outcomes assessed baseline 3 , 6 12 month . The information amount hour lose removal medical leave record daily . Expected result : It expect intervention reduce occurrence musculoskeletal disorder consequent worker absenteeism due sick leave , 100 hour work lost . It expect result obtain study may contribute set standard field Occupational Health , well decision making professional work area .</detailed_description>
