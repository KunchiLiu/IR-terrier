	<brief_summary>Previous work show epidemiological context patient 's presentation provide important information clinician aid diagnosis treatment . With current electronic health record , increasingly possible perform syndromic surveillance local specific patient 's characteristic . The investigator develop algorithms syndromic surveillance number condition contextual information might use treat clinician . The syndromic surveillance algorithm already develop influenza-like-illness , whooping cough , asthma exacerbation , Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis , gastroenteritis infection . The investigator plan study tool cluster randomize control cohort study evaluate clinical decision making affect use tool outpatient general practitioner . The goal incorporate validate algorithms quality improvement tool provide point-of-care clinical decision support clinician</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The epidemiological context patient 's presentation provide important information clinician aid diagnosis treatment . The investigator previously develop validated syndromic surveillance tool detect influenza-like illness ( ILI ) encounter . The investigator evaluate 40,642 outpatient ILI episodes 'flu season ' 6 year . The investigator find even control patient presentation physician factor , context patient present strongly associate likelihood antimicrobial agent would prescribe . Specifically , patient less likely prescribed antibiotic present ILI pandemic influenza period ( awareness 'flu season ' high ) , physician personally see many patient ILI prior week . Currently , clinician limit access data regard 'context ' patient present . Under circumstance , physician often unaware local epidemiological information could help make optimal treatment decision . In center advanced use electronic health record ( EHRs ) , increasingly possible perform syndromic surveillance local ( e.g . specific neighborhood school district ) , current ( e.g . updated daily ) , specific patient 's characteristic ( e.g . age , chief complaint ) . To end , investigator develop algorithms syndromic surveillance number syndrome include Asthma , ILI , Pertussis , Group A Streptococcus Pharyngitis , Gastroenteritis . These algorithm may provide contextual information might use clinician . The purpose study determine effect point-of-care clinical decision tool form syndromic surveillance algorithm affect clinical decision make amongst outpatient health care provider also patient outcome . We use 2 year look back prior tool roll comparison . Specific Aims : To determine effect point-of-care clinical decision tool clinical decision make amongst primary care provider . To determine clinical outcome patient whose physician access tool To understand point-of-care clinical decision tool use among healthcare provider day day practice</detailed_description>
