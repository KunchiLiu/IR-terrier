	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well trametinib without Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 ( GSK2141795 ) work treat patient uveal melanoma spread part body ( metastatic ) . Trametinib GSK2141795 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether trametinib effective without GSK2141795 treat patient metastatic uveal melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trametinib With Without GSK2141795 Treating Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival treat trametinib alone treat combination trametinib GSK2141795 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival treat trametinib alone treat combination trametinib GSK2141795 . II . To compare overall response rate treat trametinib alone treat combination trametinib GSK2141795 . III . To compare safety toxicity treat trametinib alone treat combination trametinib GSK2141795 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical outcome ( response rate , progression-free overall survival ) trametinib GSK2141795 progression trametinib . II . To assess toxicity trametinib GSK2141795 progression trametinib . III . To correlate clinical outcome Gnaq/11 mutational status . IV . To assess pharmacodynamic effect trametinib alone GSK2141795 , utilize whole-transcriptome reverse phase protein array identify marker sensitivity primary resistance trametinib alone GSK2141795 . V. To assess change circulate tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience objective disease progression may crossover Arm B . ( patient enrol Arm B Crossover therapy 11/6/2015 ) ARM B : Patients receive trametinib PO QD Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
