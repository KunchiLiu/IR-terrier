	<brief_summary>Depression older home healthcare patient occur often , typically treat appropriately , lead poor health outcome . This study test intervention , call `` Depression Care Patients Home '' Depression CAREPATH , design help home healthcare nurse work patient , family , doctor manage depression treat depression accord clinical guideline manage treatment time .

	<detailed_description>The goal research improve depression treatment outcomes among elderly home healthcare patient . Homecare nurse major source health care large grow number medically ill injure old adult homebound illness disability . Clinically significant depression twice prevalent patient population compare similarly age primary care patient . Depression effectively treat old adult , treatment guideline develop help physician make treatment decision depress old patient . However , medical home healthcare patient rarely receive guideline-consistent treatment depression . This research test effectiveness intervention , Depression Care Patients Home '' ( CAREPATH ) , two outcome : 1 . Depression treatment ( i.e. , initiate treatment change treatment consistent guideline ) , 2 . Depressive symptom ( i.e. , reduction depressive symptom time ) . The CAREPATH protocol design partnership home healthcare provider . It include major element depression care management model proven effective primary care restructure element fit clinical need home healthcare patient consistency home healthcare practice . The intervention design ecologically sensitive maximize feasibility generalizability program . The CAREPATH Intervention test within six home healthcare agency locate Vermont/New Hampshire , New York , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Florida , Arkansas . The design include randomization ~20 team nurse CAREPATH usual care . The impact CAREPATH depression treatment test eligible patient ( N~600 ) use data collect routinely agency kinds data agency typically use quality assurance . Depressive symptom outcomes test use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) collect researcher staff ( N=300 ) patient consent in-person baseline telephone follow-up interview 12 , 24 , 52 week . Data Plan : H1 Depression Treatment : Patients CAREPATH home nurse clinically significant depressive symptom likely receive `` guideline-based step '' treatment depression patient nurse provide usual care . This analysis test use merge administrative data set . A mixed-effects logistic regression analysis compare patient intervention usual care group change depression treatment receive . The primary independent variable ( fixed effect ) group dependent variable change ( start-of-care discharge guideline consistent treatment receive ( yes/no ) . The structure data cluster randomize trial involve three level mixed-effects model patient nest within nurse nurse within team supervisor . These analysis precede mixed-effects model compare group sociodemographic clinical variable . Those variable differ significantly include covariates primary analysis examines intervention effect ( describe ) . H2 Depressive Symptoms : Patients CAREPATH home nurse clinically significant depressive symptom great reduction depressive symptomatology ( HDRS change baseline ) 3 , 6 12 month baseline interview patient receive usual care . This analysis test use data collect patient research interview . A mixed-effects linear regression analysis compare patient intervention usual care group change severity depressive symptom baseline . Covariates model select described H1 . D9.3 Exploratory Analyses : . S1 . Different Outcomes : . Whether intervention reduces risk poor outcome measure Medicare 's `` Outcome-Based Quality Indicators '' ( OBQI ) target adverse event , include : decline activity daily live , discharge hospital , and/or fall . This analysis test use merge administrative data set . Mixed-effects analysis conduct follow OBQI outcome adverse event . Mixed-effects linear regression use continuous measure ( e.g. , ADL decline ) whereas mixed-effects logistic regression analysis use binary outcome ( e.g. , fall ) . The choice covariates structure data conform describe H1 . We anticipate exploratory analysis sufficiently power statistical test ( e.g. , decline ADL ) , yet others ( e.g. , adverse fall event ) examine direction magnitude effect rather statistical significance . S2 Patient Characteristics Moderators : Whether effect intervention patient outcomes quality care differ depression severity , patient location ( e.g. , rural vs. urban ) , race/ethnicity ( White , Black , Hispanic , Native American ) , availability social support ( caregiver ) , health status , cognitive impairment . Separate model examine patient characteristic moderator use mixed-effects linear logistic regression analysis . The independent variable include intervention respective hypothesize mediating ( post baseline ) moderating ( baseline ) effect ( describe ) . Initially main effect test . Then subsequent model examine incremental contribution interaction intervention hypothesize moderating effect . D10 POWER ANALYSIS Power analyse primary hypothesis conduct base follow assumption sample size : 5 agency ; 4 nurse team per agency , 5 nurse per team , 5 patient subject per nurse . These assumption result patient sample size 500 patient ( 5*4*5*5 ) . We estimate number patient consent research interview half patient eligible base agency 's database data ( i.e. , 60 % participation baseline ; 85 % baseline patient eligible follow-up ) . Thus number patient agency 's database could include analysis use source data least 1,000 . Other assumption power analysis include two-tailed alpha = 0.05 , 12 24 week follow-up assessment subject , attrition rate 15 % . This rate base six month follow-up rate well experience sample community-dwelling frail elder ( e.g. , home care patient ) , find obtain first interview far difficult follow old adult overtime meet talked u . Because computer algorithms readily available conduct power analysis three-level mixed-effects model , power estimate test H1 H2 base simulation describe , involved 1000 simulation run combination specification . H1 Depression Treatment : The simulation consider two intraclass correlation reflect variation level 1 ( subject-level intraclass correlation within nurse ) level 2 ( nurse-level intraclass correlation within team ) . Statistical power detect hypothesize effect anticipate sample size , exceed &gt; 80 % . H2 Depressive Symptoms : Power analysis conduct base simulation use Mixed-effects model level 1 level 2 level random intercept 3-level linear mixed effect regression model . We hypothesize medium intervention effect ( Cohen 's ) standardize group mean difference HDRS change baseline : 0.5 0.6 . ( These correspond difference HDRS change = 3.43 , 4.11 base estimate residual standard deviation = 6.85 HAM-D change TRIAD study . ) The table show power detect effect size &gt; 0.5 adequate ( &gt; 80 % ) .</detailed_description>
