	<brief_summary>Renal colic usually cause obstruct stone along ureter . Some patient present high level creatinin blood , even though normal function contralateral kidney . Furthermore creatinin ideal marker renal function acute change . Several work show modern urinary marker NGAL ( neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ) , KIM-1 ( Kidney Injury Molecule-1 ) others rise earlier much sensitive kidney insult . There lack research role acute kidney obstruction</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population include 100 men woman recruit upcoming year , follow 3 month . The study population divide 2 group : 1 . The stone group : 80 patient , age 18-65 , normal creatinine past year present ER renal colic , image show ureteral stone . 2 . The non-stone group : 20 patient present department elective surgery relate stone bladder outlet obstruction . The stone group : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- In ER patient examine , undergo blood urine workup image usual . If applicable accord inclusion exclusion criterion admit include stone group . After sign informed consent , either patient ureteral stone normal creatinine patient ureteral stone abnormal creatinine , Their urine sample send urinary marker : NGAL , KIM-1 , ENdothelin Cystatin C. At point decide admit discharge accord clinical imaging laboratory finding , acceptable . The admitted patient follow 48 additional blood urine test . The admitted patient undergo renal drainage specific subgroup selective urine test take drain kidney The non stone group : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- These control group take single blood urine test elective surgery .</detailed_description>
