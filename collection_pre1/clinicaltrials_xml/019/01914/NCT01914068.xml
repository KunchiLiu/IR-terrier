	<brief_summary>Patients ' ability tolerate surgery associate physical fitness : less fit patient increase rate death serious complication follow major surgery . Combined chemotherapy radiotherapy ( x-rays ) prior rectal cancer surgery know neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NACRT ) associate improved cancer removal adversely affect physical fitness . In Liverpool , investigator pre-pilot data show NACRT reduces objectively measure physical fitness ( measure cardiopulmonary exercise test ) patient surgery . This pre-pilot study investigated effect 6-week structured responsive endurance training programme ( SRETP ) NACRT cancer surgery . This programme improve fitness health relate quality life ( HRQL ) . Now , investigator undertake randomise control trial compare change patient 's physical fitness response SRETP group patient give exercise advice . The SRETP group exercise 3 time week 9 week . The investigator make objective measurement physical fitness group . The investigator monitor patient 's perception train programme , HRQL , daily activity ( use accelerometer ) , outcomes surgery . The investigator believe , patient exercise group improve physical fitness prior surgery , change behaviour towards exercise , improve activity HRQL follow NACRT . These result contribute design large , multi-centre trial determine whether SRETP increase physical fitness reduction adverse outcome follow surgery . The investigator conduct adequately power randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare SRETP 'exercise advice ' 46 rectal cancer patient . Specifically , test follow hypothesis outcome : PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS A 9-week , structured responsive endurance training programme ( SRETP ) compare control group ( train ) result clinically significant difference physical fitness ( 2.0ml/kg/min VO2 LT ) post-NACRT prior surgery . SECONDARY OUTCOMES 1 . A 9-week SRETP compare control group ( train ) result clinically significant difference physical fitness ( 2.0ml/kg/min VO2Peak ) patient NACRT prior surgery . 2 . SRETP follow NACRT prior cancer surgery provide psychological health benefit improve patient 's HRQL ( assess semi-structured interview questionnaire -EORTC QLQ-30 EQ-5D ) . This provide vital exploratory information inform future application deliver large appropriately power RCT explore hypothesis patient great pre-operative fitness encounter lower postoperative morbidity mortality . Specifically , exploratory outcome : EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES 1 . To investigate whether SRETP follow NACRT prior surgery associate change overall physical activity ( assessed number step active use accelerometer ) . 2 . To investigate whether change day 7 surgical morbidity ( use Post-Operative Morbidity Survey ) mortality . 3 . The effect SRETP cancer downstaging post-NACRT ( Tumour , Node Metastasis Staging-TNM staging ) .</brief_summary>
