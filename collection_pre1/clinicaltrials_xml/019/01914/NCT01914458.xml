	<detailed_description>This single center , single arm , non-randomized prospective study . We plan enroll person 50 74 year age , cigarette smoking least 30 pack-years , , former smoker , quit within previous 15 year . Persons previously receive diagnosis lung cancer , undergone chest CT within 18 month enrollment , hemoptysis , unexplained weight loss 6.8 kg precede year exclude . All participant complete questionnaire cover many topic , include demographic characteristic smoke behavior . We also plan collect additional data plan analysis cost-effectiveness , smoke cessation . Lung-cancer get biopsy biospecimens available researcher peer-review process All screening examination plan perform accordance standard protocol , develop medical physicist associate trial , specify acceptable characteristic machine acquisition variable . All low-dose CT scan acquire use multidetector scanner minimum 16 channel . IDEALCAP radiologists certify appropriate agency board complete train image acquisition ; radiologist also complete training image quality standardize image interpretation . Images interpret first isolation comparison available historical image image prior IDEALCAP screen examination . IDEALCAP primary analysis detection rate lung cancer . Secondary analysis include detection rate lung nodule , 5-year survival rate person lung cancer receive standard surgical treatment , 5-year survival rate person lung cancer receive alternative treatment standard surgical treatment ( ex . Radiotherapy , chemotherapy target therapy ) , correlation CT image cigarette smoke history , correlation CT image pulmonary function . Key Wordï¼š low dose computed-tomography ( LDCT ) , lung cancer screening</detailed_description>
