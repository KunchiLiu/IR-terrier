	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate whether significant difference landmark vs. ultrasound guide approach Subclavian Central Venous Catheter ( SCVC ) placement term success rate , time take perform procedure complication rate . By use ultrasound identify anatomical structure see landmark approach , investigator hypothesize procedural time complication rate ultrasound guide approach lower landmark approach . The investigator hypothesize success rate high ultrasound group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Landmark vs. Ultrasound Guided SCVC ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Placement central venous catheter ( CVC ) common critical care procedure perform emergency physician Emergency Department ( ED . ) Numerous study show physician able reduce time require , complication rate , number attempt , increase overall success CVC placement use ultrasound guidance . Thus , ultrasound guide CVC placement increasingly utilized ED . The investigator propose study investigate utility ultrasound guidance placement subclavian CVC ( SCVC ) ED . Currently numerous study , include prospective randomize trial , compare landmark ultrasound guide placement Internal Jugular ( IJ ) Femoral CVC , ED ICU setting . However , yet prospective randomize trial similarly look SCVC placement ED setting . There study look ultrasound guide SCVC placement perform critical care setting , trial methodological limitation . Recently , large ( 401 patient ) , randomize , prospective study ICU Greece publish landmark approach compare ultrasound guided SCVC placement . The author find ultrasound guide SCVC superior landmark approach success rate , time cannulation , complication rate . The investigator would like conduct similar prospective randomize study ED , investigator compare success rate , procedural time complication rate landmark real-time ultrasound guide approach SCVC placement . In contrast recent Greek study , study involve different patient population . The Greek study look ventilated ICU patient , study look adult patient ED set . Once independent clinical decision reach place SCVC ED attend physician , study investigator contact enroll patient . Patients randomly assign receive either landmark ultrasound guide SCVC placement . In ultrasound guidance group , two person technique utilized ultrasound machine operate one investigating physician , catheter place ED physician caring patient . The investigator employ real time ultrasound guidance use transverse longitudinal view help direct needle vein . Once vascular structure identify ultrasound investigate physician , physician place SCVC direct puncture skin optimal location determine investigate physician . Ultrasound use throughout entire procedure cannulate underlying vein . In landmark group , SCVC place use anatomic landmark locate puncture site physician work clinically ED . The Seldinger technique use SCVC placement landmark ultrasound guide approach . Using stopwatch , investigate physician document `` Begin Time '' patient equipment prepped full sterile precaution . In group , timer would start point time - - needle ready puncture skin . Complications also note investigate physician SCVC placement , include number puncture attempt , success/failure blood return SCVC port , occurrence catheter tip misplacement , arterial puncture , incidence hematoma , hemothorax , pneumothorax . As per routine protocol , post-procedure chest x-ray obtain review evidence complication . The final Radiology Attending interpretation chest xray also record .</detailed_description>
