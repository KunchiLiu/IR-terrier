	<brief_title>Safety Study Cord Blood-derived Cytokine-induced Killer Cells Patients With Solid Tumor After Radical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 2.6 million people suffer cancer 1.8 million die cancer China yearly accord Annual Report Cancer Registration China 2012 . So far , main treatment modality tumor surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy . However , tumor relapse still risk patient underwent conventional therapy . With development oncology immunology recent year , immunotherapy represent novel path obtain durable long-lasting response cancer patient . Cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell heterogeneous subset ex-vivo expand T lymphocytes present mixed T-NK phenotype endow MHC-unrestricted antitumor activity . CIK cell expand conventionally peripheral blood mononuclear cell addition variety cytokine vitro culture . Autologous CIK cell infusion therapy patient malignancy report world widely . However , several drawback autologous CIK limit clinical application . For example , limit cell number , decrease cell activity , unavailable time etc . Cord blood , novel source non-senescent lymphocyte tumor immunotherapy , focus recently . Accumulating preclinical study show cord blood-derived CIK cell potent anti-tumor effector use adoptive cancer immunotherapy . However unclear whether administration cord blood-derived CIK cell safe patient malignancy . Our previous study demonstrate clinical scale expansion CIK cord blood feasible . The cord blood-derived CIK cell exhibit antitumor effect vitro vivo ( tumor bear nude mouse ) variety tumor cell include ZR751 , MCF7 , HepG2 , SMMC-7721 , Hela , A375 , DU145 , H1299 A549 . Furthermore , intravenous infusion single dose 3X10^8 cord blood-derived CIK cell mice safe . The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability cord blood-derived CIK cell patient solid tumor follow radical resection .</detailed_description>
