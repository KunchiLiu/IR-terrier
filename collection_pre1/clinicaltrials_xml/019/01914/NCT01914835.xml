The aim research investigate impact neuropsychological intervention base stimulation cognitive function attention , planning , organization , logical reasoning , executive functioning , decision making . For research propose intervention motivational strategy board game , especially chess associate PFC functioning , since game require complex cognitive ability , : inhibitory control , mental flexibility , sustain attention , future plan decision-making . There two group patient cocaine/crack dependence ( n = 56 ) , one NR ( group A , n = 28 ) another without NR ( group B , n = 28 ) . Group B submit placebo intervention . Both group submit extensive battery neuropsychological test psychopathological rating scale intervention . A sub-group also submit functional magnetic resonance image biomarkers measure ( BDNF cortisol ) .
