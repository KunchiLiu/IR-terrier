	<brief_summary>People Multiple Sclerosis ( pwMS ) often experience 'foot-drop ' mean foot adequately lift so-called swing phase ( foot ground ) walk lead trip fall . Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) shin muscle aid lift foot therefore reduces risk trip fall . There several study show benefit FES walk pwMS . The propose study aim optimise FES prescription fit care pathway pwMS Edinburgh Lothians This achieve firstly survey client MS last 5 year regard suitable FES . Secondly , pilot study ass suitability use simple clinical measurement ( electrogoniometry ) allow measurement degree foot-drop . The degree foot drop usually assessed physiotherapist use visual observation . Using small device quickly fit patient 's low foot duration 2-6 minute walk , physiotherapist able quantify degree foot drop time . Such measurement especially important people MS often affect increased mental physical fatigue . Our first hypothesis degree foot-drop end walk increase compare start walk . Secondly , hypothesise degree foot drop less participant walk assistance Functional Electrical Stimulation next clinical appointment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Electrical Stimulation People With Multiple Sclerosis Who Experience Foot Drop</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants People MS ( age 18 ) assess suitability FES treat foot-drop Slateford Medical Centre eligible participation study . For feasibility study aim recruit least 10 participant . Recruitment Eligible patient give information sheet physiotherapist introduce study initial appointment . A second appointment make fit FES unit patient willing consider take part study , inform consent take . Data collection To record degree foot-drop , one arm electrogoniometer attach side participant 's low leg arm shoe use skin-friendly double sided adhesive tape . The participant ask walk normal walk speed around corridor clinic six minute shorter participant able walk duration . A data logger carry belt participant 's waist continuously record ankle angle data 50Hz . Walking speed derive measure distance walk time record . Rate perceive exertion Borg Scale record every minute immediately walk . Participants also ask fill questionnaire perceive walking performance ( Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale 12 ) . At follow-up appointment ( 1-2 week later ) data collection repeat participant use FES unit . Data analysis . To assess impact fatigue ankle angle prolong walking , ankle angle data first last 60 second walk record . Two way ANOVA employ analyse effect time ( within session ) FES use ( 'Off ' 'On ' , session ) degree foot-drop data normally distribute . Equivalent non-parametric statistic use non normally distribute data . Statistical significance accept p &lt; 0.05 . Inclusion criterion People MS ( age 18-80 ) assess suitability FES treat foot-drop September 2013 March 2014 Slateford Medical Centre eligible participation study . Exclusion criteria Patients fix ankle deformity , allergic tape unable walk least two minute ( without walk aid ) exclude . Patients experience relapse trauma affect walk first fitting appointment follow-up appointment also exclude study .</detailed_description>
