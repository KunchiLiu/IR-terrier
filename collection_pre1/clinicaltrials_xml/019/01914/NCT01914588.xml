	<brief_title>Multiparametric Telemonitoring In Elderly People With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The participant recruit two setting : - Patients discharge first diagnosis heart failure Geriatric Acute Care ward teach hospital ( `` Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico '' , Rome , Italy ) ; - Patients principal diagnosis heart failure attend outpatient clinic hospital . All participant evaluate baseline end study use multi-dimensional assessment include well validate routinely used tool screen geriatric patient order detect global , physical instrumental autonomy consequent degree dependence , well cognitive status . The assessment tool include : Activities daily live scale ( ADL ) Instrumental activity daily live scale ( IADL ) ; Abbreviated mental Test ; Geriatric Depression Scale ; Physical Activity Scale Elderly ; Six-minute walking test ; The Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12 ) ; Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( CIRS ) ; complete list drug . Once write consent form obtain , participant allocate study group 1:1 ratio use computer-generated random list number . Participants follow six month . Patients intervention group monitor via system call PHEBO ( Platform High tech Evaluation Biometrics Observation ) consist commercial Android-based smartphone kit measurement instrument ( sphygmomanometer , pulse oximeter electronic scale ) bluetooth transmitter . The smartphone receive via bluetooth reading measurement instrument , communicate real-time reading central component system issue reminder patient measurement schedule . Patients telemonitoring group receive training session instruct use monitor system perform measurement case symptom . At end session correct comprehension system function test patient . A study physician available call office hour assist patient need instruction . A technician also available order solve ingoing hardware malfunction . Participants unable properly use kit exclude study . The kit able record peripheral oxygen saturation , heart rate , systolic , diastolic average blood pressure , body weight , average physical activity . We set specific schedule measurement : - Blood pressure heart rate : three time day - Peripheral oxygen saturation : three time day - Body weight : day - Physical activity : record continuously . The data receive evaluated every day geriatrician . The monitor system display alert measurement outside predetermined range . In case abnormal reading , physician contact patient verify whether symptom worsen new symptom arise . In event , patient 's adherence therapy check , unsatisfactory , individually tailored intervention promote adherence carry . Otherwise , appointment ( patient milder abnormality symptom ) hospital admission schedule . Participants include intervention group receive standard care . In particular , patient discharge acute care ward receive detailed instruction medical therapy lifestyle counselling . A follow-up visit schedule 1 month discharge . A geriatrician available telephonic support Monday Friday , two hours/day . Patients enrol ambulatory setting follow plan visit general practitioner .</detailed_description>
