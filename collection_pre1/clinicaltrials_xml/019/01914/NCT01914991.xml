	<brief_summary>Study Design : Randomized control clinical study . Introduction : Physiotherapeutic intervention aim restore mobility use different technique stretch , hot pack , exercise , therapeutic ultrasound orthotics . No scientific evidence find correlate improve joint mobility use technique . Application techniques orthoses reshape soft tissue well detail , however , scientific evidence support effectiveness proximal interphalangeal joint ( PIPJ ) lag extension resolution use single treatment find . Purpose Study : The purpose study test effectiveness static dynamic orthosis patient PIPJ flexion retraction use single treatment compare traditional combined therapy . Method : 63 participant include study . Patients use splint compare control group receive conventional treatment . Active passive mobility measure experiment three month . All patient measure condition treat hand therapist . The relationship contracture resolution function measure use DASH Spanish Version .</brief_summary>
