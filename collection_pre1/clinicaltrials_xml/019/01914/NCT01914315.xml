	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective study determine whether comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation superior usual disease management treatment patient heart failure preserve systolic function ( HFpEF ) recently discharge acute heart failure event . The investigator hypothesize addition bi-weekly structured exercise training interaction medical personnel lead great reduction cause hospitalization mortality provide additional functional clinical benefit exercise capacity , quality life well-being . Furthermore investigator seek establish clinical , laboratory echocardiographic predictor hospital readmission cardiovascular event predefined HFpEF population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our primary objective test hypothesis comprehensive multi-disciplinary cardiac rehabilitation program superior usual care treatment patient HFpEF discharge acute heart failure event , result 25 % reduction composite outcome cause hospitalization all-cause mortality 1-year follow-up . This objective represent safety efficacy end-point patient population high rate co-morbidities , may affect well . Previous observation show patient high rate non-cardiac death comparison HFrEF , thus enhance importance all-cause hospitalization mortality primary end-point . Secondary end-points record include separate component primary end-point , time first hospitalization , functional capacity measure NYHA class , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , blood pressure rest exercise , fast glucose Hb A1C level , BNP value quality life EQ5-D questionnaire .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients &gt; =21 year age willing able sign consent form Hospitalization acute heart failure ( AHF ) one internal medicine department participate study AHF primary diagnosis define : ( I ) The presence pulmonary congestion edema chest radiography OR ( II ) Evidence fluid retention ( pedal edema , pleural effusion , ascites ) otherwise explain condition ( i.e . malignancy , nephrotic syndrome , liver cirrhosis , severe hypoalbuminemia , etc ) AND ( III ) Echocardiography demonstrate presence preserve systolic function In case diagnosis unclear BNP testing ( cutoff value &gt; 300 ng/dl ) use . If clinical suspicion pulmonary disease investigator encourage perform pulmonary function test patient condition stabilize . Preserved systolic function determine inhospital recent ( within 3 month ) echocardiographic examination accord ESC guideline absence hemodynamic significant valvular disease . Stable clinical condition prior discharge permit initiation exercise training program Hemodynamically significant valvular disease ( severity &gt; mild TR ) Acute coronary syndrome primary diagnosis End stage heart failure NYHA IV Severe renal dysfunction eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73m2 renal replacement therapy Inability participate exercise program comply study protocol Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ( FEV1 &lt; 50 % ) asthma define severe First episode hypertensive crisis event ( without history chronic heart failure ) Cognitive decline major psychiatric pathology Non ambulatory condition Life expectancy &lt; 12 month Substance dependency Inability participate due technical barrier significant distance cardiac rehabilitation center</criteria>
