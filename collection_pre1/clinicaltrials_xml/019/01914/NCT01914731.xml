	<brief_summary>Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) reconstitution normal flora `` stool transplant '' healthy individual C. difficile-infected recipient , long successful approach recurrent/refractory C. difficile . The purpose project generate frozen FMT inoculum well-screened healthy volunteer donor use repeatedly , particularly healthy intimate partner relate donor . Delivery FMT perform colonoscopically , fecal retention enema , nasogastric route . This study evaluate safety secondarily efficacy inoculum administer frozen orally-administered capsule . Subjects recurrent/relapsing C. difficile infection receive FMT via oral capsule The primary endpoint assessment safety measure clinical event ( GI , procedural , systemic ) . Efficacy define resolution diarrhea antibiotic C. difficile , absence need OTHER systemic antibiotic , i.e . resumption normal bowel status individual . Secondary efficacy endpoint include weight , subjective well-being relative clinical improvement per standardize questionnaire , subject qualitative assessment , satisfaction , transplant procedure . Subjects monitor clinical safety history standard exams follow-up questionnaire well follow closely phone person .</brief_summary>
