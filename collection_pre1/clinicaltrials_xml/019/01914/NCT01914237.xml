	<brief_summary>Aim : Castor novel single-branched stent graft system endovascular repair aortic arch dissection . This prospective , one-arm , open , multi-center , pre-market study Castor stent evaluate efficacy safety treatment aortic dissection . Number patient : 70 patient include undertaken endovascular repair Castor stent . Follow-up : 1.aortic compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) examination 6 12 month surgery 2.telephone clinical follow-up 30 day 2-5 year surgery Primary Outcome Measure : success rate endovascular repair efficacy measurement . Secondary Outcome Measure : 1 year stent related adverse event rate safety measurement . Other Outcome Measures : 1. efficacy : - 1 year success rate treatment - 1 year patency rate branch stent 2. safety : - in-hospital mortality - complication rate neural system - 1 year dissection stent relate mortality</brief_summary>
