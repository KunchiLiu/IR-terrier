	<brief_summary>This phase 2 study see useful , safe , tolerable investigational drug call ENMD-2076 treating patient ovarian clear cell carcinoma . ENMD-2076 oral drug work block certain enzyme call Aurora A tyrosine kinase work . These enzyme need cell divide include cancer cell . ENMD-2076 also work stop growth new blood vessel would provide tumor nutrient grow . It believe block Aurora A tyrosine kinase enzymes work stop new blood vessel grow , tumor may stop grow shrink .</brief_summary>
