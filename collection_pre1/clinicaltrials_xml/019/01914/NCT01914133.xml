	<brief_title>Acarbose Older Adults With Postprandial Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blocking absorption carbohydrate brush border small intestine acarbose ( alpha-glucosidase inhibitor ) seem promising possibility potential therapeutic agent . Although design second-line diabetes drug , medication little risk hypoglycemia old adult . In fact risk hypoglycemia extremely low even patient concurrently take concurrent hypoglycemia agent ( include insulin ) , almost risk hypoglycemia subject diabetes medication . Acarbose suppress postprandial glycemia slow small intestinal digestion absorption carbohydrate , show slow gastric empty Acarbose yet examine prospective fashion old adult , despite prevalence PPH patient population . Preliminary , pilot work do laboratory old adult PPH demonstrate hypotensive response 90 minute standardize meal significantly reduce administration acarbose</detailed_description>
