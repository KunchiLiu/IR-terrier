	<brief_summary>This study test combination regimen Nilotinib Ruxolitinib therapy treatment patient Philadelphia positive chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) resistant multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies BCR-ABL kinase inhibition activity . Ruxolitinib tyrosine kinase inhibitor block alternative pathway independent BCR-ABL mediate pathway , thus potential overcome tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance Philadelphia positive CML ALL patient . Phase I study conduct define recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) phase II study examine hypothesis combinational approach increase response rate resistant CML/ALL patient , thus evaluate efficacy combination regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Nilotinib/Ruxolitinb Therapy TKI Resistant Ph-Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) treat combination approach Nilotinib Ruxolitinib may block alternative pathway besides BCR-ABL kinase inhibition Ph positive leukemia , esp JAK2-STAT5 pathway . First step define dose Ruxolitinib fix dose Nilotinib approve dose 400mg bid imatinib fail CML . During phase I part study , dose escalation decide basis DLTs observe hence exact sample size could predict certainty range 9-12 patient . Three patient enrol per dose level . Accordingly 9 patient expect enrolled . If DLT observe , 3 patient enrol dose level DLT occur . The study conduct multiple site across Canada enrollment competitive . Once 3 patient enrolled cohort , dose level closed enrollment safety assessment 3 subject performed end cycle 1 . This procedure perform dose cohort . Patients assign dose level base authorization sponsor collaboration Ozmosis Research Inc. For phase II part study , RPTD establish phase I portion trial , phase II begin . The phase II portion two-stage , single arm , unblinded study investigate potential efficacy combination Ruxolitinib Nilotinib . A maximum 20 patient accrue phase II portion . Those patient treat phase I portion trial RPTD include analysis Phase II study .</detailed_description>
