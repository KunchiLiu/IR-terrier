	<brief_title>Immunological Mechanisms Allergy Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The process immunization treatment allergic disease brings change well understood understand develop constantly . In study plan check large number immunological parameter broaden scope knowledge evaluate individual immune health across multiple sub field medicine advance basic understand immune cell signal . The study involve 70 participant age 18-45 sex . Persons enrol study diagnose allergic rhinitis cause dust mite person develop systemic reaction follow bee sting candidate treat immunization . After verification diagnosis allergic condition decision start immunization , blood sample draw participant immunization weekly 24 week . Blood sample analyze order identify immune cell subset difference change response allergy immunotherapy . Comparisons make baseline stimulation-induced status protein phosphorylation individual time-series course receive allergy immunotherapy pinpoint molecular mechanism underlie desensitization . Evaluations make cellular mechanism allergy immunotherapy comparing time group , serum cytokine profile blood gene expression individual undergo allergy immunotherapy shot .</detailed_description>
