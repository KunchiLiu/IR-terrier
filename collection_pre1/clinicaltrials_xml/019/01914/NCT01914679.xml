	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate mechanism noninvasive cortical electrostimulation therapy know `` Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical Electrostimulation '' RINCE ) management fibromyalgia . Patients meet 1990 American College Rheumatology criterion fibromyalgia receive 24 RINCE treatment deliver medical device call `` NeuroPoint '' . Approximately 20 patient receive combination active inactive ( sham ) therapy treatment 16-week period follow 4 week post-treatment evaluation . Patients also undergo three ( 3 ) functional brain imaging scan participate study : first prior commencement treatment , another mid-treatment ; third completion treatment period . The study 's primary outcome measure change baseline self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity . The study 's hypothesis change pain intensity well brain functioning . We expect statistically significant improvement pain intensity due small sample expect see statistically significant change cortical function measure EEG fMRI</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient must provide write informed consent privacy authorization prior participation study . Patient must ability read and/or follow write oral instruction , abide study restriction , agree return require assessment . Patient female , 1865 year age ( inclusive ) time consent . Patient must confirm diagnosis fibromyalgia meeting ACR 1990 diagnostic criterion fibromyalgia . Patients must 24hour recall pain intensity score screen baseline visit 40 90 inclusive 100 mm VAS scale . Female patient childbearing potential must willing use acceptable method birth control duration study participation . Patients must willing refrain exclude therapy duration study . In opinion Investigator , patient willing able comply protocolspecified requirement . Participants undergo fMRI 1HMRS must predominantly right hand ( i.e . subject writes right hand ) . The patient eligible enrollment history , opinion investigator , follow criterion meet : Patient current significant psychological psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , severe , unstable poorly control depression , severe anxiety obsessivecompulsive disorder ; history suicide attempt within precede 5 year suicidal ideation within precede 6 month ; history bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , schizoaffective psychotic disorder ) . Patient total Hospital Anxiety Depression score 1121 either anxiety depression , , base investigator 's judgment , patient risk suicidal ideation behavior . Patient currently use prohibit medication treatment ( see Prohibited Concomitant Therapy section protocol ) include stimulant , anesthetic patch , CPAP and/or TENS therapy . Patient active diagnosis treat chronic infection chronic condition lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , hepatitis , polio , seizure , cancer ( basal squamous cell skin cancer ) . Patient chronic pain condition fibromyalgia , Investigator 's opinion , would interfere assessment fibromyalgia ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis , post herpetic neuralgia , pain associate diabetic neuropathy , severe pain due degenerative joint disease , etc . ) Patient history seizure disorder , dementia epilepsy anytime life except pediatric febrile seizure . Female patient pregnant , plan pregnancy , breastfeed . Patient disease medical condition , opinion investigator , would interfere evaluation study device efficacy safety , would compromise patient 's ability participate complete study . Patient history cranial electrical stimulation device use , electroconvulsive therapy . Patient metal implant , stent , aneurysm clip , shunt , pacemaker , defibrillator , neurostimulators contraindication fMRI 1HMRS . Longbone implant exclude . Any anticipated need surgery might confound result interfere patient 's ability comply protocol . Myocardial infarction precede 12 month , uncontrolled hypertension , active cardiac disease ( American Heart Association Functional Class 2 , 3 4 Objective Class C D ) , clinically significant cardiac rhythm conduction abnormality , anticipation bypass cardiac surgery within next 12 month . Current systemic infection ( e.g. , HIV , hepatitis ) . Patients receive systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 5 mg prednisone equivalent per day ) . Pending current litigation disability claim ( include Workman 's Compensation ) . Patients currently receive disability benefit require medical monitor approval casebycase basis . Patient history alcohol and/or drug abuse . Patient participate investigational study within 30 day prior Screening visit currently participate another clinical trial . Patient receive prior experimental treatment therapy , opinion medical monitor , would compromise patient 's ability participate study . Patient staff member relative staff member either investigative site Cerephex Corporation . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) great approximately 40 kg/m2 . Claustrophobia factor sufficiently significant likely prevent successful completion fMRI 1HMRS procedure .</criteria>
