	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Optimized Retreatment Prolonged Therapy With Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This interventional , randomize ( assignment group happen chance , like flip coin ) , open-label , parallel-group , event-driven , international , multicenter , Phase 3 study . This study different phase : pre-treatment phase , treatment phase ( consist optimize retreatment period follow prolonged therapy period , standard retreatment period follow posttreatment period ) , long-term follow-up phase survival end study . Before premature stop enrollment , end study event-driven , define 1 year 186 event ( 'event ' define disease progression death ) . Following premature stop enrollment , effective 20 June 2014 , end study define maximum 18 month enrollment last patient study . After provide write informed consent , patient evaluate eligibility 14-day pre-treatment period . The study doctor carry test see patient suitable study , within two week receipt first dose study drug . Once determined patient able participate , he/she randomly assign 1 2 different bortezomib retreatment schedule . In first randomization , patient receive optimize retreatment standard retreatment 2:1 ratio . Group A : optimize retreatment follow prolonged therapy . Patients start therapy retreatment 6 cycle bortezomib dexamethasone ( two 21-day cycle follow four 35-day cycle ) follow second randomization 1:1 ratio 1 2 prolonged therapy schedule bortezomib alone ( Group A1 : weekly first 4 week 35-day cycle ; Group A2 : every week ) . Group B : standard retreatment eight 21-day bortezomib dexamethasone cycle , follow posttreatment follow-up every 6 week . During retreatment phase , series test do first day cycle . For patient Group A doctor ass patient respond treatment . Only patient respond , he/she able continue prolong therapy part study . At time patient randomize one two group ( Group A1 Group A2 ) prolong therapy phase . During prolonged therapy phase disease status response therapy evaluate every 6 week . This phase continue disease progress , case unacceptable toxicity despite dose modification . During posttreatment period patient group B continue evaluate disease status every 6 week confirm disease progression , start alternative multiple myeloma treatment , withdrawn study , death end study ( maximum 18 month last patient enrol study ) , whichever occur first . In case patient discontinues bortezomib disease progression treatment phase , he/she ask complete End Study Visit procedure evaluate every 6 week confirm disease progression , start alternative multiple myeloma treatment , withdrawn study , death end study ( maximum 18 month last patient enrol study ) , whichever occur first . All patient End Trial Visit perform 30 35 day last administration bortezomib , soon possible bortezomib treatment discontinue patient receive alternative multiple myeloma therapy . After confirmed disease progression start first alternative multiple myeloma therapy , patient enter long-term follow-up phase maximum 18 month last patient enrol study . During phase , patient contact least telephone call every month follow first alternative multiple myeloma therapy survival . From end study country bortezomib commercially available prolonged therapy accessible ( via national program access program ) time , patient opinion investigator would continue benefit prolonged therapy bortezomib , continue supply bortezomib accessible particular country period 2 year , whichever occurs first . Before premature stop enrollment , plan enroll target 240 patient study .</detailed_description>
