	<brief_title>Neurostimulation Vagus Nerve Reduction Frequency Seizures Associated With Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine effect non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation reduction frequency seizure associate epilepsy subject 18 old . Subjects record 4 week baseline seizure activity randomize period 4 week receive active treatment active-sham treatment . All subject receive another 4 week active treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient diagnose epilepsy ; primary generalize tonicclonic partial complex simple complex focal onset seizure , without secondary generalization . 2 . The patient 's present antiepileptic drug ( AED ) therapy ineffective intolerable 3 . The patient receive stable dose 2 oral AED medication ( ) expect change his/her baseline AED treatment treatment period . 4 . The patient 2 recordable seizure month . 1 . The patient status epilepticus within last six month . 2 . The patient epilepsy surgery VNS implant . 3 . The patient history presence seizures occur cluster ( frequently indistinctly separate reliably count ) . 4 . The patient 4 week continuous seizure freedom last 2 month . 5 . The patient psychogenic nonepileptic seizure ( PNES ) seizures . 6 . The patient concomitant progressive CNS disease include progressive myoclonus epilepsy . 7 . The patient significant history cardiac , renal , neurologic ( epilepsy ) , psychiatric , oncologic , endocrinologic , metabolic , hepatic disease , would adversely affect participation study . 8 . The patient episode status epilepticus within 4 week Screening . 10 . Has lesion ( include lymphadenopathy ) , dysaesthesia , previous surgery abnormal anatomy GammaCore treatment site . 11 . Has know suspect severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , severe carotid artery disease ( e.g . bruits history TIA CVA ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , know severe coronary artery disease recent myocardial infarction . 12 . Has abnormal baseline ECG ( e.g . second third degree heart block , atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , recent history ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation , clinically significant premature ventricular contraction ) . 13 . Has previous bilateral , right , leave cervical vagotomy . 14 . Has uncontrolled high blood pressure . 15 . Is currently implanted electrical and/or neurostimulator device , include limited cardiac pacemaker defibrillator , vagal neurostimulator , deep brain stimulator , spinal stimulator , bone growth stimulator , cochlear implant . 16 . Has history carotid endarterectomy vascular neck surgery right side . 17 . Has implant metal cervical spine hardware metallic implant near GammaCore stimulation site . 18 . Has recent repeat history syncope . 19 . Has know history suspicion substance abuse addiction . 20 .
