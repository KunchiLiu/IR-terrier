	<brief_summary>The present study aim develop technique base single dose calcium isotope , enable determine effect nutritional intervention bone calcium metabolism . For purpose nutritional intervention calcium , vitamin D vitamin K apply postmenopausal woman . Treatment effect determine urinary excretion calcium isotope related classical bone marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Nutrition Bone Metabolism Assessed 41Ca</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In present proposal method describe may enable study effect nutrition bone calcium turnover far accurate , within short time frame therefore less intensive volunteer clinical study compare presently exist method . This method enable screen promise food concept combat osteoporosis within relatively short time . Recent development show use nuclide 41Calcium ( 41Ca ) measurement accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) great potential measuring effect bone level within relatively short period time . When introduce diet change ( intervention ) bone metabolism calcium may change result change 41Ca-signal urine . So far medication study osteoporotic volunteer perform appear ultrahigh sensitive technique may also applicable nutrition study healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
