	<brief_title>Long-Term Quality Life Patients With Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study focus long-term survivor define America Cancer Society , survive initial diagnosis 5 year . Previous research investigate long-term Health Related Quality Life ( HRQOL ) patient acute myeloid leukemia , however , first research conduct investigate long-term HRQOL outcomes patient acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . The potential late effect cancer treatment include second malignancy chronic condition affect physical emotional well-being . Therefore , increase interest worldwide evaluate longer-term impact cancer treatment . Currently large cohort patient enjoy disease-free survival 5 year longer . However , disease-free status synonymous life free physical psychological health related cancer and/or treatment . Research show cancer related health concern persist long initial treatment show several cancer population include prostate , testicular , breast cancer lymphoma patient . Long-term cancer survivor experience treatment-induced morbidity ( e.g . cardiovascular damage due chemotherapy radiotherapy ; infertility second tumor ) , chronic disease treatment-related symptom , functional impairment , psychosocial problem , practical problem . Since introduction vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) front-line therapy APL , outcome acute leukemia subtype change state frequently fatal leukemia condition highly curable disease . The Italian cooperative group GIMEMA design 1993 AIDA ( Atra plus IDArubicin ) trial newly diagnose APL . Results 800 patient show complete remission ( CR ) rate &gt; 90 % overall survival 76 % confirm concomitant administration ATRA chemotherapy effective sequential administration . Following identification distinct prognostic category among APL patient , GIMEMA group design new trial ( AIDA2000 ) intensity post-remission treatment adapt relapse risk 498 patient enrol since January 2000 . The result recently publish show CR rate &gt; 90 % molecular remission rate third consolidation 98 % . The new schedule allow Disease Free Survival ( DFS ) 86 % show risk-adapted strategy include ATRA consolidation provide outcome improvement newly diagnose patient . As reported international panel expert , simultaneous ATRA anthracycline chemotherapy schedule use AIDA protocols represent state art therapy newly diagnose APL .</detailed_description>
