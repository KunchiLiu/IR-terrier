	<brief_summary>Invasive cardiac procedure involve procedural guidance x-rays form fluoroscopy . X-ray exposure pose potential risk acute long-term complication staff involve procedure . Lead shield place operator ( left side ) x-ray source limit exposure . However operator require direct access patient x-ray scatter occurs , full protection possible . Lead gown , thyroid collar , lead glass typically wear protect body , thyroid , eye respectively , thickness limit relatively heavy weight . Nevertheless leave brain expose . Further , interest risk brain cancer invasive cardiologist re-emerged recent report left-sided brain cancer primary operator interventional cardiology procedure . Lead cap test past relatively heavyweight lead limit wide-spread implementation . The cap typically worn invasive procedure lightweight , significant x-ray absorption property , wear help maintain sterile environment . A novel , lead-free cap , compose mainly barium sulfate bismuth oxide , develop show absorb x-ray significantly light lead . The investigator propose use multiple x-ray detector test exposure difference primary secondary operator , leave side right side head , absorption via lead-free cap .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Radiation Exposure Attenuation During Invasive Cardiology Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study evaluate radiation exposure operator invasive cardiovascular procedure UCSD Medical Center La Jolla . Primary secondary operator cardiac catheterization procedure use fluoroscopy guidance , include cardiac catheterization , coronary angiography , interventional procedure wear multiple dosimeter evaluate level radiation exposure . The primary secondary operator wear six dosimeter head ; three outside non-lead attenuate cap three underneath cap . Above beneath cap , dosimeter leave side , center , right side head . The dosimeter wear target least 50 procedure operator . The primary operator closest procedural site fluoroscopy unit majority procedure , secondary operator right side primary operator procedure . The operator maintain designation participate study . All operator continue wear dosimeter issue catheterization laboratory part standard radiation monitoring . Each operator assign six dosimeter , secure within cap time assignment . The use cap respective set dosimeter record log book secure cardiac catheterization laboratory associate specific cardiac case number . Specific factor relate operator radiation exposure procedure record include : operator height , patient weight BMI , dose area product ( DAP ) , fluoroscopy time , length procedure , type procedure , access site , complexity procedure determine attend physician . The operator comment comfort cap use semi-quantitative scale level exposure measure dosimeter . The operator also ask compare contrast study cap attenuate non-attenuating cap previously wear . At conclusion study , statistical analysis perform determine differential level exposure primary secondary operator , different side head , attenuation ability XPF cap . The dosimeter outside cap serve control evaluate attenuate ability cap compare correspond dosimeter inside . Each dosimeter location outside cap compare location outside inside set . And finally , exposure measurement compare primary secondary operator dosimeter location . The specific factor list affect operator exposure take account well .</detailed_description>
