Participants randomize one two study condition : cross-systems family-based intervention ( Multidimensional Family Therapy-Cross Systems ( MDFT-CS ) , 2 ) Enhanced Services Usual ( ESAU ) . Both condition incorporate HIV prevention detention also examine effect family-based HIV/STD prevention module beyond impact standard HIV/STD education intervention deliver detention include ongoing HIV/STD intervention MDFT-CS follow release detention . There five aim propose study .
