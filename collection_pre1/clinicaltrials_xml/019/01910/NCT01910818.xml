	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy , essential modality cancer treatment , frequently induce fibrotic process skin lead increase risk malignancy , poor wound heal , pain limitation movement , permanent loss skin appendages hyper/hypopigmentation , decrease sweat xerosis , pose significant cosmetic quality life issue . Advances laser therapy lead use fractional laser treatment ( FLT ) treat fibrosis associate hypertrophic scar morphea , lead tissue repair , scar remodeling . The investigator propose pilot clinical study test hypothesis FLT normalize fibrotic process induce normal scar remodel patient affect chronic radiation injury . Understanding correct underlying fibrotic process help restore normal skin function patient affect chronic radiation dermatitis ( RD ) debilitate fibrotic disease dermatology scleroderma , morphea , nephrogenic systemic fibrosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Effect Laser Reversing Chronic Radiation Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose treat 22 patient significant radiation induce fibrosis ( RIF ) skin change . Each patient receive fractional treatment ( FLT ) use Lumenis Ultrapulse Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) laser well control ( treatment ) randomize site . Patient age , type cancer , method/dosage radiation , latency radiation treatment start study , characteristic skin change record , include fibrosis surface area , depth , color , compliance . Assessments conduct treatment , treatment , 3-12 month last treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Healthy male females 18 70 year age radiationinduced fibrosis depigmentation . The fibrosis must occur least 1 year prior date enrollment . 2 . Having suitable area treatment : All wound area interest must close least two month . The scar must deem stable period 3 month suitable contralateral control initiation treatment . This determine objective measurement scar erythema , pliability , induration , thickness enrollment 3 month ; 3 . Fitzpatrick skin type IVI ; 4 . Able willing comply visit , treatment evaluation schedule requirement ; 5 . Able understand provide write informed consent ; 6 . Pregnant woman include study involve local intervention , new drug . 1 . Active tanning , include use tan booth , course study ; 2 . Prior skin treatment laser device treat area within three month initial treatment course study ; 3 . Adverse reaction compound external agent ( e.g. , gel , lotion anesthetic cream ) require use study , alternative say agent exists ; 4 . History collagen vascular disease ; 5 . Active Herpes Simplex Zoster time treatment experience three episode Herpes Simplex / Zoster eruption within year study enrollment ; 6 . History immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorder ( include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) use immunosuppressive medication ; 7 . Having form active cancer time enrollment course study ; 8 . Significant concurrent illness , uncontrolled diabetes ( hemoglobin A1C 8 ) ( i.e. , disease state opinion Investigator would interfere anesthesia , treatment , heal process ) ; Mentally incompetent , prisoner evidence active substance alcohol abuse ; 9 . Any condition , Investigator 's opinion , would make unsafe ( subject study personnel ) treat subject part research study ; 10 . If determined contracture due deep process involve muscle , ligament bone . 11 . Patient chemotherapy ( tamoxifen thing affect wound heal ) also active XRT 12 . Participation another interventional study potential exposure investigational drug within past 30 day</criteria>
