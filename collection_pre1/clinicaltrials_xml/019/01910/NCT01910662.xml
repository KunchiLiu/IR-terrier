	<brief_summary>This exploratory study develop methodology assessment T-cell mediate therapy via skin immune challenge study healthy volunteer . The study investigate appropriate ; skin challenge agent , time methodology sample characterise T-cells delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) skin reaction . The skin challenge agent use study neoantigen Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ( KLH ) recall antigen Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative ( PPD ) . Part A study ass intradermal ( ID ) KLH challenge three subject assess immune response KLH initiate innate adaptive immune system . Each subject receive one ID dose 0.1 milligram ( mg ) KLH assess skin inflammatory response . Part B study ass repeat ID challenge 28 day apart ; objective characterise T-cell response challenge kinetics response . For Cohorts 1A 1B , 16 subject receive initial subcutaneous ( SC ) 5 mg dose KLH . Fifteen day later subject receive 0.1 mg ID KLH dose response assess 48 120 hour initial challenge . The ID KLH challenge repeat 28 day later response assess 48 hour ( Cohort 1A , 8 subject ) 120 hour ( Cohort 1B , 8 subject ) post challenge . For Cohort 2 , repeat challenge either 2 tuberculin Unit ( TU ) 10 TU ID PPD administer 28 day apart , 8 subject . The first challenge response assess 48 120 hour post challenge . The second challenge administer 28 day first assess timepoints . The repeat challenge 28 day later allow intra-subject analysis determine subject use control . Part C study assess repeat ID challenge PPD PBS ; objective characterise T-cell response challenge kinetics response . For Cohort 1 , 6 subject receive 0.1ml ID dose PBS another dose 24 hour later . Each challenge assess 48 hour post challenge . Approximately 2 subject assessment normal skin control . For Cohort 2 , repeat challenge either 2TU 10TU ID PPD administer 28 day apart , 6 subject . The first challenge response assess 48 post challenge . The second challenge administer 28 day 1st assessed timepoint . The repeat challenge 28 day later allow intra-subject analysis determine subject use control . The total duration study Part A 14-18 day plus 30 day screen . The total duration study Cohort 1A 56-60 day plus 30 day screen . The total duration study Cohort 1B 59-63 day plus 30 day screen . The total duration study Cohort 2 2TU use 45-49 day plus 30 day screening . The total duration study Cohort 2 10TU use 48-51 day plus 30 day screen . The total duration study Part C Cohort 1 15-19 day plus 30 day screening . The total duration study Cohort 2 2TU use 42-46 day plus 30 day screening . The total duration study Cohort 2 10TU use 45-49 day plus 30 day screen .</brief_summary>
