	<brief_summary>Asparaginase ( Asp ) use induction phase ALL treatment child young adult . Its efficacy counterbalance toxicity , mainly patient 40 year old . The efficacy rate old adult population lower child young adult . A recent review outcome old adult ALL point significantly drug reduction , omission delay old group compare young adult asparaginase drug commonly omit . The investigational product ERYASPASE dispersion infusion homologous red blood cell ( RBC ) encapsulate E. coli L-asparaginase . A previous European phase I/II clinical study child adult ( &lt; 55 yo ) first relapse ALL conduct determine optimal dose homologous RBC encapsulate native E. coli Asp ( GRASPA® ) 24 patient relapse ALL . The activity safety profile 3 dos GRASPA® ( 50 , 100 150 IU/kg ) combination standard chemotherapy compare free native Asp . The global safety profile also improve , reduce hypersensitivity , liver toxicity coagulation disorder . Study show single dose GRASPA® 150 IU/kg induce depletion plasmatic asparagine 18.6 day , i.e . similar obtain 8 injection 10,000 IU/m² free native Asp . A reduction incidence severity allergic reaction coagulation disorder observe GRASPA® ( Domenech 2011 ) . A French phase II study design determine maximum tolerate dose GRASPA® combination polychemotherapy regimen ALL patient older 55 yo first diagnosis perform , show 100 150 IU/kg dos fulfil predefined criterion efficacy tolerability well profile 100 IU/kg dose consider optimal dose setting . A phase II/III trial adult child patient relapse ALL currently ongoing . Based result , combination ERYASPASE CALGB chemotherapy regimen appear attractive combination treatment adult patient ALL/LBL .</brief_summary>
