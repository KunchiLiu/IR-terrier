	<brief_summary>The main aim study investigate whether increase amount physical activity frail old people hospital base rehabilitation associate well mobility outcome compare usual care . A second aim investigate whether physical activity intervention associate improvement health relate quality life . Finally plan investigate whether increase amount physical activity rehabilitation cost effective , measure health system perspective , compare usual care . Older people receive inpatient rehabilitation randomly assign intervention group , receive extra physical activity weekdays weekend control group , receive additional activity base social interaction . The activity session individualize particular participant . Both group people assess baseline , discharge hospital 6 month follow discharge . The intervention group provide one two extra session weekdays two extra session weekend duration rehabilitation stay . To account extra physiotherapy time intervention group receive , people control group spend amount time perform activity , card , board game read , whilst seat . To ensure safety participant study , physical activity session supervise either physiotherapist allied health assistant . Hypothesis 1 : The primary hypothesis , compare usual care , increase amount physical activity frail old people rehabilitation lead optimal mobility discharge , measure gait speed . Secondary hypothesis , compare usual care , increase amount physical activity rehabilitation : Hypothesis 2 : lead significantly great improvement mobility function discharge six month follow discharge . Hypothesis 3 : lead well quality life six month follow hospital discharge , measure use EuroQol Health ( EQ5D ) Questionnaire EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale ( EQ-VAS ) . Hypothesis 4 : cost effective compare usual care</brief_summary>
