	<detailed_description>Given vitamin D absorb proximal small intestine , believe vitamin D deficiency people fat malabsorption syndrome may due decrease absorption vitamin D. All diseases small bowel cause fat malabsorption . These fat malabsorption syndrome include Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , cystic fibrosis among others ( 1,2 ) affect amount nutrient fat absorb gastrointestinal tract . Gastric bypass surgery indicate surgical treatment morbid obesity make stomach small allow food bypass proximal part small intestine , many mineral vitamin absorb . Food ( calorie ) intake dramatically reduce new small stomach . Many patient bypass surgery develop nutritional deficiency adhere post-operative guideline concern need nutritional supplement . Malabsorptive operation like gastric bypass surgery pose particular risk multiple nutritional deficiency , include vitamin D malabsorption . ( 3 ) Vitamin D ingest diet , supplement , well synthesize naturally skin follow UVB irradiation sun . As sunlight enters atmosphere , radiation 290 nm absorb stratospheric ozone layer . Radiation 290 315 nm responsible convert 7-dihydrocholesterol ( provitamin D3 ) epidermis dermis previtamin D3 . Once form , previtamin D3 undergoes thermally induced isomerization vitamin D3 . Vitamin D3 enters circulation metabolize liver 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [ 25 ( OH ) D ] kidney 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [ 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ] 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1á-hydroxylase [ 1á-OHase ] . 25 ( OH ) D major circulate form vitamin D routinely measure blood determine vitamin D status patient . The amount vitamin D produce winter sunlight dietary source negligibly raise blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D level . People live area receive less sunlight low circulate 25-hydroxyD ( major circulate form use measure vitamin D status ) level . Vitamin D deficiency ( define serum 25 ( OH ) D level &lt; 20 ng/ml ) general population treat oral supplementation vitamin D dose 50,000 IU give weekly eight week . ( 1 ) However clinical experience , oral supplementation limit efficacy vitamin D deficiency patient malabsorption syndrome likely due inability efficiently absorb vitamin D. * ( 1-3 ) A variety UV light source develop sell in-home tanning device produce vitamin D reptile . In pilot study , investigator observe 5 8 subject significant increase circulate 25 ( OH ) D exposure Sperti® lamp 24 week . However , possibility correct vitamin D deficiency skin exposure artificial source UVB radiation patient fat malabsorption study . The first aim study evaluate efficacy FDA approve artificial source UVB radiation ( Sperti® lamp ) raise serum 25 ( OH ) D level patient fat malabsorption due Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , cystic fibrosis gastric bypass surgery cause . The second aim study compare rise serum 25 ( OH ) D repeat measure study patient 4 different skin type ( type II-V ) . The device investigator use study originally design tan . From pilot study H23521 investigator observe much long time needed increase production vitamin D. As see Figure 1 , healthy adult expose 10 minute Sperti lamp show significant increase serum 25 ( OH ) D level subject study . The investigator find 5 8 subject show significant increase 25 ( OH ) D. Those skin type IV V demonstrate minimal response due sunscreening effect skin pigment ( Fig 2 ) . This demonstrate skin type IV V may require long exposure time achieve 0.75 MED dose raise serum 25 ( OH ) D level . However , pilot study , investigator observe untoward side effect ( skin redness ) associate exposure UVB light longer exposure time .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Men woman , age 18 year old skin type 2,3,4 5 . 2 . The patient establish diagnosis condition associate fat malabsorption due bowel disease ( Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , cystic fibrosis ) , history gastric bypass surgery least 3 month postsurgery continue complication . 3 . The patient able understand information provide give write informed consent study . 4 . The patient able understand complete selfadministered questionnaire . 5 .
