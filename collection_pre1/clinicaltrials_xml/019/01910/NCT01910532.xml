	<brief_title>The Evaluation Clevidipine Patients Requiring ICP Monitoring IV Antihypertensive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open label safety dose titration study evaluate use Clevidipine rapidly control elevate blood pressure patient Intracranial Pressure Monitoring device . All patient ICP monitoring carry need maintain Cerebral Perfusion Pressure ( CPP ) within tight range ( typically , 70-90 mmHg ) order avoid secondary brain injury relate either high low CPP . In context clear benefit associate medication able control hypertensive situation quickly lend easy reliable modulation . Clinical study demonstrate Clevidipine effective antihypertensive agent rapid onset offset action , favorable safety profile . Clevidipine predictable dose-response profile readily titrate achieve individualize pharmacodynamic effect . The investigator reason Clevidipine could effective anti-hypertensive agent cohort patient need rapid precise blood pressure control . It hypothesize improved blood pressure control patient population may result reduction severity neurological impairment . The question answer follow : Is Clevidipine highly effective achieve maintain Blood Pressure control patient hypertension ( Systolic Blood Pressure &gt; 160 mm Hg ) require Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device ? Clevidipine highly effective achieve maintain Blood Pressure control patient hypertension require Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device .</detailed_description>
