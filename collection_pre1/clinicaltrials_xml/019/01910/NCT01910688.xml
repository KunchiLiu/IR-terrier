	<brief_title>Use Radiofrequency Ablation RGB Salvage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity lead cause preventable death United States , approximately 300,000 related death per year . The commonly perform bariatric surgical intervention Roux-en Y gastric bypass ( RGB ) laparoscopic adjustable gastric band placement . Despite overall initial success RGB induce significant EBWL majority patient , significant weight regain occur 25 % patient 2+ year follow surgery . Given preliminary success endoscopic , non-surgical salvage intervention fail ( uncomplicated ) RGB patient , present study ass feasibility use endoscopic radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) treat gastric pouch stoma intent cause tissue contraction decrease compliance . A reduction size compliance may , others report , result re-establish weight loss achieve acceptable EBWL minimal patient morbidity .</detailed_description>
