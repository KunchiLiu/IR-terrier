	<brief_summary>This prospective , multicenter , non-randomized , parallel design compare primary efficacy endpoint subject undergo immediate post-mastectomy breast reconstruction breast implant Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix ( TM ) subject undergoing immediate , two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction , initially place expander exchange breast implant , without type reinforcement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Single Stage Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study compare efficacy immediate single-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction Strattice™ TM , otherwise refer direct implant ( DTI ) compare immediate two-stage post-mastectomy breast reconstruction initially place expander exchange breast implant , without type reinforcement . The objective achieve prospectively assess number plan unplanned post-mastectomy surgical intervention A within 12 month mastectomy . Two-stage breast reconstruction include initial placement tissue expander total partial submuscular position . In case partial muscle coverage , without support mesh autologous flap reinforce low pole . The expander inflate approximately next one six month , replace implant .</detailed_description>
