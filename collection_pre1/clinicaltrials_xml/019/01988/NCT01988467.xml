	<brief_title>The Protective Role Nose During Acute Exposure Passive Smoking .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Analysis laboratory testing : The measurement NO respiratory tract perform Ecomedics CLD 88spNO analyzer follow : examinee perform tidal breathing close nose , special mouthpiece take deep breath exhale steadily flow 50ml/sec . After 3 attempt , obtain exhale NO measurement time , obtain reliability index CV &lt; 10 % . For oscillometry ( IOS ) respiratory tract Master Screen IOS VIASYS use , examinee breathe quietly mouthpiece his/her nose close period 1 minute . In way measure impedance Z 5 Hz , resistance 5,10,20 Hz respectively , reactance 5,10,20 Hz respectively , central peripheral airway resistance resonant frequency . Rhinomanometry do Master Screen IOS VIASYS system , examinee breathe calmly examine nostril , close , 5 breath per attempt perform . After 3 attempt nostril , assessed average inspiratory resistance nostril separately . The plethysmography take place Master Screen Body VIASYS , door Body close well door room without presence motion test room . The subject perform calm breath close nose , mouthpiece take deep breath , follow deep exhalation . At end effort value total lung capacity ( TLC ) , residual volume ( RV ) , airway resistance ( R ) , vital capacity ( VC ) , functional residual capacity ( FRC ) , Exhaled residual volume ( ERV ) ratio RV / TLC . This repeat 3 time one select representative . The P.100 perform Master Screen Body VIASYS door Body Box open . The volunteer perform calm breath close nose , mouthpiece , shutter block flow . The obtained value pressure one develop first second inhalation shutter note . This repeat 3 time one select representative . Spirometry flow-volume curve assess Master Screen Body VIASYS door Body Box open follow : The subject perform tidal breathing close nose , mouthpiece , take sharp deep breath , follow sharp deep exhalation , test end deep inhalation . At end effort value force vital capacity ( FVC ) , violent expiratory first volume 1 ( FEV1 ) , ratio FVC/FEV1 % , peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) mesoexpiratory flow peripheral airway 25 % 75 % vital capacity . This repeat 3 time one select representative . The assessment type breathing exposure secondhand smoke perform VIASYS Respitrace . The protocol follow : The volunteer breathe calmly 20 time mouth close close nose , wear two rubber band , one chest one abdomen , incorporate electrode . The waveform breath thorax , abdomen average record real time . Also , every breath value inspiratory time , expiratory time , total time , participation rate chest , participation rate ventricle , peak inspiratory flow ( Pif ) , mean inspiratory flow ( Mif ) , flow-volume curve analysis chart breath thoracic abdominal component .</detailed_description>
