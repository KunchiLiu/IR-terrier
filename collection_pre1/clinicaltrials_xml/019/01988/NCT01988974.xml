	<detailed_description>The purpose propose research evaluate psychometric property Knowledge , Attitudes , Beliefs Atrial Fibrillation Survey ( KABAFS ) , instrument design tailor delivery Alert Atrial Fibrillation program . The propose research also test feasibility study effect Alert Atrial Fibrillation program treatment-seeking symptom AF large , randomized trial . This research significant , current research suggest treatment seek AF hinder people recognize symptom represent AF , attribute symptom alternative cause , believe symptom serious enough require medical evaluation . Interventions tailor modify patient-specific knowledge , attitude , belief hinder early treatment-seeking critically need order improve early detection AF .
