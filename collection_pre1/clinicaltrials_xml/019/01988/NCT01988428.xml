	<brief_summary>Sepsis one frequent reason referral emergency department ( EDs ) worldwide . The incidence sepsis likely rise upcoming year . Sepsis tendency become serious left untreated high mortality rate , exceed even myocardial infarction stroke . Therefore , much effort put start appropriate therapy early possible . Early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) emergency department fluid resuscitation , administration vasopressors/vasodilators intravenous antibiotic patient severe sepsis septic shock indeed decrease mortality substantially . Emergency medical service ( EMS ) personnel already make significant difference improve care patient acute coronary syndrome , multiple trauma stroke . Patients severe sepsis septic shock could also benefit greatly timely pre-hospital care . Earlier recognition initiation treatment EMS personnel may improve survival even . Interestingly , first hour ED presentation seem critical hour . Administration antibiotic fluid resuscitation pre-hospital set reduce time administration substantially . In adult , best knowledge , study effect pre-hospital administration antibiotic perform . In child meningitis , uncontrolled study show contradictory result , probably due bias severity . We propose non-blinded randomised multicentre clinical trial study efficacy early , pre-hospital intravenous administration broad spectrum antibiotic ( ceftriaxone ) , effective wide variety infectious pathogen cause common community-acquired infection ) patient refer ED suspect severe sepsis septic shock . Objective : To evaluate whether early , pre-hospital administration antibiotic , together train ambulance personnel recognize initiate treatment reduces 28-day mortality patient refer ED suspect severe sepsis septic shock Study design : Non-blinded randomized multicentre clinical trial nest within stepped wedge design Study population : All patient age 18 year , suspect severe sepsis septic shock transfer ED ambulance , eligible study inclusion Intervention : prehospital antibiotic ( ceftriaxone 2000 mg intravenously ) Main study parameters/endpoints : 28-day mortality , hospital length stay , admission intensive medium care unit ( ICU/MC ) , time administration antibiotic .

	<detailed_description>Introduction Sepsis one common life-threatening disease world , cause death AIDS , breast cancer prostate cancer put together ( 8-10 ) . Despite fact mortality sepsis ten time higher myocardial infarction five time higher stroke , relatively little attention give sepsis ( 23-25 ) . In recent year successful clinical care management pathway develop patient suffer myocardial infarction , stroke trauma . Even though strong evidence scientific literature support need series time-dependent action , sepsis still case . On 13 September 2012 , first ' World Sepsis Day ' held main objective : 'to increase awareness sepsis potentially lethal condition , consider medical emergency ' ( 26 ) . Prompt recognition treatment extremely important improve survival , patient survive sepsis still continue suffer physical psychological symptom . The likelihood severity complication depend number factor include severity sepsis length stay hospital stay ICU . Definition Sepsis define proven strongly suspect infection associate 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome ' ( SIRS ) ( 29,30 ) . SIRS exist least two four criterion meet : abnormal body temperature , increased heart rate ( 90 beat per minute ) , increase respiratory rate ( 20 per minute ) abnormal white blood cell ( WBC ) count . There different degree sepsis basis severity . Sepsis may develop severe sepsis septic shock , treatment timely initiate . Severe sepsis define sepsis failure one organ system septic shock severe sepsis persistent low blood pressure despite adequate resuscitation . In particular organ failure shock cause high mortality . In Netherlands , 10,000 patient sepsis admit hospital annually , average length stay ( LOS ) 15 day . The medical cost approximately $ 20,000 per person , total cost severe sepsis Netherlands estimate nearly 170 million per year ( 1-3 ) . Mortality high sepsis timely adequately treat , especially among vulnerable elderly population . The mortality rate vary 20 60 percent , depend age underlying disease diabetes cancer . Even VUmc mortality rate almost 40 % . Multiorgan failure due sepsis septic shock lead cause death ICU ( 31,32 ) . The incidence sepsis increase recent year expect trend continue , partly due age population partly increase number immune-compromised patient highly susceptible kind ( opportunistic ) infection . Early Goal Directed Therapy ( EGDT ) The advent antibiotic major step forward treatment sepsis , cause mortality decrease approximately 25 percent ( 33,34 ) . It noteworthy decade hereafter little progress treatment sepsis make , introduction 'Early goal direct therapy ( EGDT ) . A study Rivers colleague ( 4 ) show apply EGDT first six hour detection sepsis , absolute mortality reduction almost 16 % achieve . This EGDT consist number intervention , purpose optimize hemodynamics quickly possible mean tight monitor arterial / venous pressure oxygen saturation . The cornerstone treatment include aggressive fluid resuscitation , administration vasopressor , give protective ventilation administration broad-spectrum antibiotic . Several large clinical trial confirm value EGDT sometimes even great mortality reduction ( 35-38 ) . Survival Sepsis Campaign Timely recognition rapid treatment sepsis appear crucial , recognize sepsis still remain challenge : symptom often non-specific various disease might fit well . Therefore `` Surviving Sepsis Campaign '' ( SSC ) launch 2003 ( 13 ) , aim create awareness sepsis well recognition treatment sepsis improve prognosis . Through campaign directive develop wherein somewhat modify form EGDT incorporate . This directive also state broad-spectrum antibiotic administer soon possible , preferably within one hour arrival emergency room . Despite extensive attention last year ( major campaign VMS ) shorten time administration antibiotic ( call `` onset needle time '' ) , still delay start antibiotic therapy emergency department ( ED ) ( 6-7 ) . EDs still function optimally , wait time sometimes exceed 6 hour . This also conclusion report : 'Haastige spoed niet overal goed ' 2004 ( Inspectie der Volksgezondheid ) . Herein EDs Netherlands describe weak link emergency care , addition accord report , little progress quality care emergency department make 1994 2004 . After much effort recommendation , progress make last year sufficiently enough ( see report `` Ziekenhuizen goed op weg meet implementatie norman voor afdelingen spoedeisende hulp ' `` ) . Our study therefore able contribute improvement in-hospital pre-hospital acute care chain . Not save costly time trip till reach hospital , moreover also overcome ( potential ) delay emergency department start therapy ambulance . Delays amount one even six hour . Why antibiotic administer early ? The first hour presentation emergency room , also know 'Golden Hour ' seem critical one treatment septic patient . Retrospective study show rapid antibiotic administration could mean good chance survival well reduction chance last physical problem . Moreover , rapid intervention may shorten hospital stay well even prevent need ICU admission ( 1-5 ) . In daily practice however , implementation SSC directives always easy , may several reason delay start treatment ( 6.15 ) . The so-called 'onset needle time ' high several hour . A recent pilot study VUMC show 25 % patient wait long three hour emergency department treatment initiate antibiotic therapy ( 16 ) . Not pilot study university also retrospective study conduct Kumar colleague 32.5 % patient receive first gift within first 3 hour ( 6 ) Any delay administration antibiotic , cause increase mortality rate almost 8 percent per hour ! ( 6 ) . The late treatment initiate , great chance multiorgan failure . Besides high mortality-rates , multiorgan failure directly correlate complication , long hospital stay high use costly healthcare facility ( 10 ) . Therefore probably important onset needle time short possible . Moreover long term sepsis cause much damage ( 17-20 ) . Patients survive sepsis often suffer month complication arise prolonged hospitalization intensive care ( eg . critical illness neuropathy , problem speech swallow prolonged ventilation ) . The quality life also sharply deteriorate experience sepsis ( 18 ) . An important point note study state early antibiotic administration associate improved survival , retrospective uncontrolled study , make occurrence selection bias probable . One reason doctor may keen initiate antibiotic early ( definitive diagnosis make ) may fact consider current evidence insufficient incomplete . In order investigate optimal timing antibiotic administration , prospective randomize controlled study perform emergency department . However , may unethical randomize patient delay initiation antibiotic therapy ED . An alternative perhaps good option perform prospective randomize trial pre-hospital setting , i.e ambulance . In current practice , initiation antibiotic therapy start emergency department ( ED ) ambulance . Pre-hospital antibiotic administration one hand may solution avoid delay treatment ED hand way finally perform randomised trial examine effect onset needle time clinical endpoint improve survival , short hospital stay well quality life . Pre-hospital care , even sepsis ? Ambulance personnel already make significant contribution improve care patient acute coronary syndrome , stroke multiple trauma ( 42 , 43 ) . Patients severe sepsis septic shock also benefit early pre-hospital care ( 44 ) . Pre-hospital care initial medical care , give ambulance personnel reach patient . Since time play crucial role treatment sepsis , early recognition initiation treatment ambulance personnel may help reduce mortality . The provision pre-hospital care associate short start-up time EGDT antibiotic therapy hospital ( 44-47 ) . In addition , appear pre-hospital care lead quicker achievement optimal blood pressure , oxygen saturation . Therefore , expect administration broad-spectrum antibiotic ambulance , survival sepsis improve greatly reduce time administration necessary antibiotic . To date randomize controlled trial effect antibiotic pre-hospital setting adult conduct . In child meningitis uncontrolled study do . In study Strang Cartwright ( 50,51 ) , clear beneficial effect survival see pre-hospital administration antibiotic general practitioner . Hamden Sorensen ( 52.53 ) contrary show administration antibiotic pre-hospital setting associate bad outcome . A possible explanation divergent result occur strong selection bias . The group child receive pre-hospital antibiotic could critical stage illness . A definitive answer question whether administration antibiotic pre-hospital set effective , obtain prospective randomize controlled trial . In form study selection bias avoid . However , recognition sepsis difficult , Suffoletto et al investigate accurately ambulance personnel Pennsylvania able recognize serious infection , negative predictive value 93 % . In contrast , 69 % patient severe infection miss ( 8 ) . A pilot study Maastricht show ( 54 ) , situation probably extrapolate Netherlands well : large proportion patient septic shock fact recognize transport B-ride ( low priority ride ) . The information transfer hereby often incomplete entirely accurate ( general practitioner ambulance personnel/hospital ambulance ED ) cause substantial delay initiate treatment . Therefore , much gain train ambulance personnel get skilled enough recognize sepsis improve transfer information . Research Consortium Through intensive collaboration major Dutch medical centre ambulance service , research consortium establish start nationwide project form multicentre randomize trial : PHANTASi trial ( PreHospital ANTibiotics Against Sepsi ) This consortium joint goal namely evaluate effect early administration antibiotic patient suspected sepsis pre-hospital setting compare regular treatment . Our hypothesis study administration antibiotic pre-hospital set significantly shorten time administration antibiotic , subsequently lead improved survival . In addition , pre-hospital administration antibiotic shorten hospital stay , simultaneously favorable effect cost quality life ( QoL ) . Importance project Sepsis major global health problem increase incidence high mortality rate . While past decade , modern medicine become increasingly sophisticated , treatment care around disease , heart failure cancer greatly improve , treatment sepsis remain problem high mortality . Early administration antibiotic critically ill patient sepsis could possibly change . It clear best time administration , early early ? Moreover , practice often happen time limit , sufficiently monitor closely , whilst increase risk death . Moreover , treatment acutely ill patient require teamwork optimally functioning acute-care chain . Through project possible investigate whether pre-hospital antibiotic therapy lead good outcome category seriously ill vulnerable patient . REFERENCES 1. van Gestel et al .
