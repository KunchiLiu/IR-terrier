	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study : ) determine whether Flow Phonation decrease Laryngeal Resistance ( Rlaw ) patient Muscle Tension Dysphonia ( MTD ) ; b ) establish relationship change measure Rlaw phonatory airflow endoscopic , perceptual , acoustic , handicap assessment rating . MTD debilitate effect individual rely voice most—teachers , preacher , salesperson , singers—costing time , money , even job . It lead vocal fatigue , pain , complete loss voice . While treatment emerge promising effect , treatment prove long-term benefit patient . Our preliminary data demonstrate Flow Phonation training result significant decrease Laryngeal Resistance phonatory airflow associate improvement voice quality voice handicap rating . Sample size pilot study small ; control group utilize ; outcome measure limit . In proposed investigation , large sample obtain , control group participant receive Vocal Hygiene Training use comparison first 3 week , wider range outcome measure include longer period time ( 1 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Laryngeal Hyperfunction With Flow Phonation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant complete Evaluation Protocol baseline , 3 week ( PERIOD 1 ) , 6 week ( PERIOD 2 ) , follow-up 3 , 6 , 12 month post-treatment . During PERIOD 1 ( first 3 week ) , participant ARM 1 receive Vocal Hygiene Training well Airflow Exercise Training participant ARM 2 ( Control Arm ) receive Vocal Hygiene Training . Vocal hygiene train alone demonstrate minimal impact voicing32-34 . During Period 2 ( second 3 week ) , participant BOTH ARMS receive Vocal Hygiene Training Airflow Exercise Training ( Fig 3 ) . Thus , participant Arm 2 receive Flow Phonation initial control comparison 3 week Flow Phonation dose response comparison Arm 1 ( non-control ) participant . Assessment Protocol Each participant receive Complete Evaluation Protocol Baseline , 3 week ( PERIOD 1 ) , additional 3 week ( PERIOD 2 ) , well 3 , 6 , 12 month posttreatment . These include : a. Laryngostroboscopic Examination b ) Perceptual Voice Analysis/CAPE-V48-49 c ) Acoustic Analysis/Computerized Speech Lab ( CSL , KayPENTAX Corp ) ) Aerodynamic Analysis/The KayPENTAX Phonatory Aerodynamic System ( PAS ) Model 6600 ( KayPENTAX Corp. e ) Patients ' Perception Voice Handicap/Voice Handicap Index Treatment Protocol Flow Phonation Each treatment session take place clinical room assessment utilize three exercise : gargling , cup bubble blowing , stretch flow . Each exercise use build form biofeedback ( water tissue ) basic progression activity ( minor alteration ) : 1 ) airflow task without voice establish positive airflow ; 2 ) add voice task ; 3 ) move pitch range voice task ; 4 ) move speaking/voicing task ; 5 ) remove biofeedback . During vocalization attempt , clinician listens clear effortless vocal quality train participant listen . Vocal Hygiene Training Vocal hygiene training center three factor : 1 ) hydration , 2 ) exogenous inflammation control , 3 ) abstinence yell scream . Information provide initially Powerpoint presentation , participant manual write answer specific question . Based response question , study clinician , concert participant , develop set recommendation vocal hygiene . Examples potential vocal hygiene target provide Table 2 . Three five recommendation target participant , base clinical judgment , although number serve guide . Participants provide daily log utilize mark target daily make comment target meet met . Each treatment session Vocal Hygiene Training target , alone concert Airflow Training , participant first present goal , provide daily log discus successes failure since prior session . The study clinician participant discus benefit successes problem solve way improve upon failure .</detailed_description>
