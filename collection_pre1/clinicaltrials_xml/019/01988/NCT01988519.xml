	<brief_summary>Pancreatic resection potentially curative modality treatment pancreatic neoplasm . The mortality associate procedure decrease rapidly past decade . However , morbidity associate pancreatic resection remain high . The main reason postoperative morbidity postoperative pancreatic fistula ( POPF ) , regard ominous complication follow pancreatic resection . Its reported incidence varies surgical literature 10 % &gt; 30 % . Recently publish study show placement intraoperative drain , manipulation drain , time removal drain , especially type drain , significant effect postoperative complication , especially POPF . Controversy exist regard type intraoperatively place drain . Nowadays , two commonly use system close suction drainage close gravity drainage . Open system abandon center obsolete . Our hypothesis close suction drain well result effective gravity drainage . However , surgeon claim suction system actively suck pancreatic juice anastomosis suture thus promote development POPF . The aim study compare close suction drain close gravity drain pancreatic resection randomize control study . The primary end-point postoperative pancreatic fistula rate . The secondary end-point postoperative morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic resection potentially curative modality treatment pancreatic neoplasm . The mortality associate procedure decrease rapidly past decade . However , morbidity associate pancreatic resection remain high . The main reason postoperative morbidity postoperative pancreatic fistula , regard ominous complication follow pancreatic resection . Its reported incidence varies surgical literature 10 % &gt; 30 % . Recently publish study show placement intraoperative drain , manipulation drain , time removal drain , especially type drain , significant effect postoperative complication , especially POPF . Even though several trial show routine use intraoperatively place drain elective pancreatectomy reduce postoperative morbidity , high-volume pancreatic surgery center still place drain routinely . The theoretical advantage drainage identify early bile pancreatic leak , postoperative hemorrhage ; therefore allow early treatment complication ; case , drain would control leak without necessity reintervention . Two large study compare early versus late removal intraoperatively place drain . The first publish Kawai et al . cohort study , include 104 patient . The second one publish Bassi et al . prospective randomized trial include 114 patient . Both study clearly show group patient early drain removal superior result , low rate POPF low morbidity . Controversy exist regard type intraoperatively place drain . The surgeon USA usually use closed suction drainage system . On hand , European Asian surgeon usually prefer open Penrose system , close gravity drainage , combination . The closed suction drainage system use slight pressure drain fluid abdominal cavity . It effective system , thus advantageous . However , surgeon claim suction system actively suck pancreatic juice anastomosis suture thus promote development POPF . Only one study publish Schmidt et al . compare closed suction drainage system gravity drainage . However , study collect result long period , comparison drain primary end-point study . Randomized control trial compare various drain publish cardiac surgery . The situation pancreatic surgery specific . The pancreatic anastomosis suture line water-tight large proportion case . It due character pancreatic parenchyma . Especially soft pancreas , stitch cut cause leak suture line anastomosis . Therefore , pancreatic leak rare pancreatic resection . Most POPF grade A accord ISGPF classification ; clinical consequence . The aim postoperative management prevent POPF become clinically severe ( grade B C ) . And manipulation drain , especially type drain , seem play major role .</detailed_description>
