	<brief_summary>This study conduct develop new technique early diagnosis liver disease . These technique : Shearwave Elastography ( SWE ) ultrasound blood biomarkers . SWE ultrasound use high-frequency sound wave view soft tissue muscle internal organ measure stiffness . An ultrasound create computer image show internal body organ , liver kidney , clearly regular x-ray image . Biomarkers biological molecule find blood provide important information liver disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abnormal liver biochemical function test frequently detect symptomatic patient since many screen blood test panel routinely include . A population-based survey United States conduct 1999 2002 estimate abnormal alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) present 8.9 percent respondent . These patient often refer hepatology elucidate cause abnormal liver test potential liver disease . Identifying cause specific pediatric liver diseases critical management treatment . Liver biopsy provide histological information often need make conclusive diagnosis historically accept best way measure liver fibrosis . Given current gold standard assess liver fibrosis via liver biopsy , several reason field look non-invasive method correlate highly liver histology . Hemorrhage , infection , need often observed overnight , anxiety , need sedation accept risk liver biopsy . The histologic grade liver biopsy ( grades 0-4 ) use grade severity hepatic fibrosis make clinical decision initiate treatment antiviral immunomodulator therapy . Ultrasound image ( sonography ) use high-frequency sound wave view soft tissue muscle internal organ , limit primarily non-sound transmit tissue air bone . Ultrasound excellent modality pediatric population provide far range diagnostic possibility , limit use radiation whenever possible . Sheerwave elastography complimentary noninvasive , real-time sonographic technique show wide range clinical application , include ability assess degree liver fibrosis chronic liver disease . Tissue inherent elasticity may alter pathologic process inflammation , fibrosis , tumor . Elastography use extensively breast image show much promise detect non-compressible mass associate increased risk malignancy . Elastography ability assess small change pliability liver tissue across entire liver . Elasticity tissue context elastography ratio tension ( stress ) need produce relative change length ( strain ) , quantify much pressure must place tissue order cause elastic deformation . Ultrasonic elastography perform detect hepatic fibrosis patient fatty liver disease adult , yet child viral hepatitis B C. Performance compression ultrasound require 5-10 additional minute image know associated risk . Serum fibrosis marker promising non-invasive indicator fibrosis progression cirrhosis adult liver disease : e.g . commercially available FibrotestÂ® use detect hepatic fibrosis hepatitis C non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . However , marker pattern appear disease development ( age ) specific , make adult marker doubtful value child . As proof principle , biopsy study another pediatric fibrosing liver entity , cystic fibrosis liver disease , specific marker pattern derive mechanistic study find highly correlate F3/4 fibrosis v F0/1 . The rapid onset liver disease child ( i.e . HBV , genotype C ) indicate need identify early marker liver fibrosis help facilitate early intervention . Serum chemistry use assess hepatic inflammation injury reliable . Empirically identified marker identify genomic , proteomic , metabolomic technology , well target serum marker analysis , offer new strategy diagnose predict outcome pediatric liver disease . Preliminary study child fibrotic liver disease identify specific marker reflect matrix re-modeling , hepatic stellate cell activation chemoattractant expression age group .</detailed_description>
