	<brief_summary>A rationally design combination adoptive T cell therapy ipilimumab could strongly increase proportion CR patient , well durability response , compare ipilimumab TIL alone . The investigator hypothesize combination two important modality could result durable ( ≥ 1 year ) complete response rate 30 % stage IV melanoma patient .</brief_summary>
