	<brief_title>New Treatment Algorithm Reduce Spherical Aberration After LASIK Correction Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-LASIK induction spherical aberration currently among prominent challenge refractive surgery . The presence significant spherical aberration visual system result reduce contrast sensitivity , visual symptom `` glare '' `` halo , '' `` night myopia '' induction myopia low lighting ( large pupil size ) . A modified Treatment Planning Software ( TPS ) `` VSS-Rx1 OPM software '' develop us modify algorithm ( software design LASIK treatment profile ) limit induction postoperative spherical aberration . Commercially available software use calculate LASIK treatment profile use one eye ( active comparator [ i.e. , control ] ) VSS-Rx1 OPM software use fellow eye ( experimental ) . Subjects mask use either commercially available VSS-Rx1 OPM software .</detailed_description>
