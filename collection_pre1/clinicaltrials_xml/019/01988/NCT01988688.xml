	<brief_title>Pilot Study Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Area LC Chronic Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institution , open-label , phase I clinical trial estimate treatment effect size ass preliminary safety tolerability DBS caudate nucleus ( area LC ) adults big big problem ( tinnitus functional index TFI &gt; 50 ) chronic tinnitus . Up 10 subject implant . The DBS stimulation parameter patient-specific allow vary course treatment period , calibrate TFI . During Period I , stimulation continuous . During Period II , three stimulation OFF/ON epoch , stimulation turn OFF turn back ON tinnitus loudness return certain level ( base change TFI score ) . During Period III , stimulation `` demand , '' i.e . control subject determine subject preference . An important goal determine whether tinnitus control optimization stimulation parameter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman age 22 75 year . Subjective , unilateral bilateral , nonpulsatile tinnitus 1 year 's duration great . Tinnitus Functional Index ( TFI ) score great 50 . Tinnitus unresponsive acoustical behavioral therapy . Prospective subject must receive least one acoustical ( masker , hear aid , Neuromonics® ) behavioral therapy ( cognitive behavioral , directive counseling , tinnitus retrain therapy ) eligible study enrollment , partial response conventional therapy exclude prospective subject individual meet TFI &gt; 50 study participation threshold . Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) ≥ 26 . Subjects childbearing potential use appropriate form birth control acceptable research team negative urine pregnancy test undergone sterilization procedure . Capacity give informed consent . Englishspeaking . Patients experience tinnitus relate untreated retrocochlear lesion , know anatomic/structural lesion ear temporal bone . Patients hyperacusis misophonia ( hypersensitivity loud noise ) . Hearing loss moderately severe great severity either ear . History seizure disorder currently treatment seizure disorder . Patients cardiac pacemaker , intracardiac line , implant medication pump , implant electrode brain , intracranial metal object exception dental filling , contraindication obtain MRI scan . Patients acute chronic unstable medical condition , opinion PI , would require stabilization prior preclude DBS surgery . Patients active ear disease , opinion PI , need evaluate . Patients psychiatric symptom , opinion study team , adequately treat would interfere study activity . Any psychiatric comorbidity may complicate interpretation study result . Pregnancy . Currently breastfeed . Patients tinnitus related Workman 's Compensation claim litigationrelated event . Patients take medication ( ) , opinion PI , ( ) deem etiologically relate development tinnitus . Preoperative neurophychological evaluation indicate either follow : Dementia Using DSMIV criterion memory impairment least one following : aphasia , apraxia , agnosia disturbance executive functioning . The cognitive impairment must severe enough cause impairment social occupational functioning must represent decline previously high level functioning . The diagnosis dementia make cognitive deficit occur exclusively course delirium . Cognitive impairment ( z &lt; 1.5 ) multiple domain without dementia ( i.e . patient functionally intact ) , opinion study team would could comply study requirement . Beck Depression InventoryII ( BDIII ) &gt; 29 , indicate severe depression . Patients history claustrophobia would interfere MRI surgery . Active alcohol and/or drug dependence history alcohol and/or ETOH dependence within last year . Any medical condition , opinion investigator , confounds study result place subject great risk . Unable provide inform consent .</criteria>
