	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Accuracy Subset Length-109 Probe Set Panel ( Genetic Test ) Predicting Response Golimumab Participants With Moderately Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study drug , golimumab , belong group medicine know tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitor approve United States , European Union , Canada treatment UC . Studies show people respond differently treatment TNF inhibitor furthermore , people may actually respond treatment . Tests could predict likelihood response golimumab prior treatment would benefit people UC . This open label ( physicians participant know identity assign treatment ) , multicenter study evaluate accuracy genetic test ( subset length-109 probe set panel ) predict response golimumab treatment patient moderately severely active UC . The study consist screen phase , open label treatment phase ( Week 0 Week 50 ) , follow-up visit Week 58 . A subset length-109 probe set panel test sample obtain colonic biopsy take prior treatment golimumab participant screen . All participant enrol study receive subcutaneous golimumab Week 0 Week 50 ; discretion investigator , participant give option self-administer golimumab Week 6 onwards . Blood fecal sample take various time point study ; colonic biopsy take screening , Week 6 , Week 30 ; endoscopy perform Week 0 , Week 6 , Week 30 . The study duration participant expect approximately 58 week . Participant safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
