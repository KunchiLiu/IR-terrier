	<detailed_description>Dry eye multifactorial condition affect 5-35 % population.1 Common symptom condition include eye irritation , heaviness eyelid , visual disturbance , tear light sensitivity.2 This condition significantly decrease patient health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) . Clinical study show poor correlation clinical test symptom self perceive severity disease.7 Studies also show utility severe dry eye similar condition class III/IV angina affect QOL.6 Correlation reduce quality life present symptom unknown compare factor cost inconvenience treatment . This implicate management condition . In addition , significant socioeconomic burden . In 2009 , 54,051 patient sought treatment dry eye Singapore National Eye Centre ( SNEC ) . In total , cost dry eye medication amount $ 181,354.17.4 Although different questionnaire use assessment dry eye , date , study evaluate extent questionnaire correlate change quality life . This particularly important since symptom dry eye episodic questionnaire administer one time point may may reflect true disease morbidity . Two questionnaire SPEED questionnaire consist 2 question grade scale 0-3 frequency grade 0-4 severity SANDE questionnaires consist 3 question base symptom frequency severity . Both questionnaire publish validated utilized eye clinic investigator . Over last year , SNEC/SERI build dedicate team dry eye researcher trial evaluation diagnostic device . There increase interest internationally , especially industry , partner u test commercial product . Clinical importance Dry eye common grow public health problem significant morbidity decrease health relate quality life . Uncertainty correlation decrease quality life present symptom factor cost inconvenience treatment may implicate management disease . For instance , present symptom correlate poorly perceive quality life , emphasis place make treatment accessible convenient . If high correlation , focus make current treatment efficacious relieve present symptom . The finding study help u decide efficacy questionnaire use future clinical trial centre . Study Objectives Purpose 1 . To determine symptom dry eye assess SPEED questionnaire correlate utility value ( HRQOL ) 2 . To determine symptom dry eye assess SANDE questionnaire correlate utility value ( HRQOL ) 3 . To evaluate extent correlation HRQOL differs significantly SPEED SANDE questionnaires Study design : Prospective cross-sectional interview study Rationale Dry eye disease define The National Eye Institute Workshop tear deficiency excessive tear evaporation cause damage ocular surface associate symptom ocular discomfort.5 These symptom cause adverse effect quality life ( HRQL ) patient result inappropriate management . In order achieve good correlation dry eye symptom quality life , investigator aim distinguish sensitive quantitative tool . Methods Interviewers pass CITI train conduct questionnaire assess patient ' quality life utility value . A set guideline teach prevent inter-examiner variability . Participants target sample size 200 symptomatic patient recruit study dry eye clinic SNEC . 100 patient dry eye clinic SNEC assess SPEED utility assessment , another 100 patient dry eye clinic SNEC assess SANDE utility assessment . Visit schedule Basic eye assessment interviewer-assisted questionnaire do day . There repeat visit require . Duration study : One year Procedures : Assessment Dry Eye Symptoms Basic biodata age , race , gender record . • Tear break time ( TBUT ) A drop normal saline instill fluorescein strip ( Fluorets ) shake visible drop remain . The subject ask look introduction fluoret inferior conjunctival fornix right leave eye . The participant blink time close eye second . The participant ask open eye , look ahead observer 's forehead blink long possible . The break time defined time lid opening first appearance dry spot cornea . The participant request close eye second procedure repeat leave eye . Three read take averaged Corneal fluorescein stain score Assessment positive fluorescein stain assess record TBUT . A score system apply previously publish Barr et al . ( Barr 1999 ) . Briefly , 5 corneal zone 4 conjunctival region show Figure 1 . The stain scale 0-4 , 0.5 unit step zone . The 'total ' stain score also average . • Schirmers I test This do standard strip currently use SERI ( 5 mm wide notch fold ) ( Sno strip , Bausch &amp; Lomb , France ) without anaesthetic . The strip position inferior temporal half lower lid margin eye time.The study participant ask close eye test . Any excessive irritation sign reflex tear note . Dry eye Questionnaires Participants ask score fill dry eye questionnaire assess symptomatic severity dry eye participant extent disruption daily activity past one month . Two different questionnaire utility assessment administer study ; - SPEED Questionnaire Consist 2 question frequency severity grade scale 0-3 frequency grade 0-4 severity . The questionnaire allow patient rate 0 never 3 time frequency 0 problem 4 intolerable severity . - SANDE Questionnaire Consist 3 question frequency severity . VAS apply evaluate dry eye symptom describe Schaumberg et al . ( Schaumberg , Gulati et al . 2007 ) . As show Appendix A ( question 1 3 ) , score record separately frequency severity dry eye symptoms. , patient ask mark `` X '' 100mm line corresponds degree symptom . A global score calculate multiplying frequency score severity score take square root result ( transform back original scale ) . - Utility assessment Investigators use Time trade-off method study , approve IRB use Thermal pulsation system treatment Meibomian Gland Dysfunction study ( CRIB : 2012/191/A ) . In addition , question socioeconomics administer patient . Statistics : Sample size calculation There interim analysis . Analysis perform subject complete questionnaire withdraw study . The distribution score examine histograms normality . Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) calculate SPEED score ( x ) utility value ( ) 2 group patient . Confidence interval calculate 95 % confidence level . The confidence limit compute ; Expected outcome : Primary Outcome - Difference SPEED Questionnaire SANDE Questionnaire affect patient health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) - Difference ( SPEED SANDE ) questionnaires utility value affect patient health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) Secondary Outcomes - Schirmers I read - Tear break time ( TBUT ) - Corneal fluorescein stain Potential problem As 2 questionnaire use English validate translated questionnaire , limited patient English-educated . For simplicity use validated questionnaire , would concentrate English-educated patient study . Dry eye sign correlate poorly symptoms patient may understand true condition make difficult obtain accurate score . In conservative population , sensitive question utility may distress patient therefore inability answer question appropriately .</detailed_description>
