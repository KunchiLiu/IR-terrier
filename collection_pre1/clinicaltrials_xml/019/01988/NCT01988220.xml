	<brief_summary>Background : It estimate 50 % -85 % individual post stroke demonstrate sensory deficit . Sensory impairment often overlook therapeutic setting , although lead slow motor recovery . Working hypothesis : The overall goal study examine effectiveness sensory discrimination reeducation orient therapeutic program lower limb stroke patient sensory impairment . We assume subject group make progress , significant experimental group . Methods : Study population design : Sixty individual chronic sensory impairment follow stroke recruit . Patients randomly assign sensory retrain treatment sensory stimulation treatment . Treatment consist ten 45 minute long intervention session , carry within 6 week period , home exercise program . The person conduct assessment blind treatment allocation subject . Outcome measure : The efficacy intervention determine relation International Classification Functionality ( ICF ) develop World Health Organization include assessment three domain define model : 1 . Body structure function - determined measure sensory capacity lower affected limb ; 2 . Activities - determine measure balance gait ; 3 . Participation - determine measure well-being social reintegration . Two new outcome measure , ankle knee position sense texture discrimination foot , develop within study . Data reliability measure healthy population , test - retest measure post stroke population collect . Intervention : The experimental group treat perception learning orient protocol sensory reeducation , improve identification , localization discrimination sensory stimulus , include electrical stimulation , texture hardness discrimination position sense training . The control group receive stimulus without attentive learn discriminate component . Importance : Scientific proof focus recommendation potent therapeutic method post-stroke population , allow good participation quality life . Key word : Stroke , sensory impairment , perceptual learning , low limb , clinical trial .</brief_summary>
