	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : Specific Aim 1 : To determine Atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) administration preserve LVEF 24 month initiation Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy adjuvant treatment breast cancer . Specific Aim 2 : To determine baseline 6-month difference LVEF predict baseline 24-month difference LVEF Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy concomitant atorvastatin therapy . To achieve aim , perform double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial 0 40 mg atorvastatin/day 250 woman schedule receive Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy treatment adjuvant breast cancer . We use innovative noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedures accurately measure LVEF . In addition , measure LV volume , myocardial strain , fibrosis , aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) wall thickness , factor influence LVEF alter LV pre-load , after-load , contractility.19,20 Advanced serum biomarkers measure assess presence oxidative/nitrosative stress , systemic inflammation circulate neurohormone also may influence LVEF . This study test new clinical paradigm manage breast cancer : primary prevention Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy-related LV dysfunction use pre-treatment low-cost statin . In addition , trial first systematic collection data regard mechanism ( ) time course LV dysfunction subsequent CHF evolve woman give Anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy adjuvant breast cancer . These data useful physician try determine optimal cardiac protection strategy administer adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen breast cancer patient . The objective research use inexpensive medication preserve CV health thereby improve overall survival grow number breast cancer patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Specific Aim 1 : To document effect Atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) cognitive function use battery neurocognitive test ( HVLT , Rey-Osterreith Figure , COWA , Trail-making Parts A B , Digit Span Grooved Pegboard ) breast cancer patient receive anthracycline . Specific Aim 2 : To document effect Atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) self-reported quality life use validated questionnaire ( PROMIS include : General form , Cog Concerns , Cog Abilities , Fatigue , Pain intensity interference , Sleep Disturbance , Physical Functioning Social Functioning ) breast cancer patient receive anthracycline .</detailed_description>
