	<brief_summary>This three year single site clinical evaluation FDA approve ( 510 ( k ) : K100062 ) lesion penetrate resin use infiltrate hamper progression proximal carious lesion . The purpose study compare lesion progression infiltrate ( Icon , Hamburg , Germany ) similar size lesion patient treat placebo . The study design randomize , control , prospective clinical trial three year follow-up evaluation period . The clinical site enroll 150 subject ( age range 19 year old ) 2 study lesion . The patient evaluate six time point period 3 year . Lesion status caries risk monitor 6-month interval , radiographic evaluation conduct 12-month interval 1- , 2- 3-year recall visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Dental caries widespread disease . It cause destruction tooth structure dissolve enamel outside tooth first progressing inside tooth . While possible use traditional dental filling replace diseased tooth structure , far good slow reverse disease process filling need . One difficult place use preventive non-surgical treatment contact area teeth . Recently evolve interest use composite infiltrate enamel dentin area begin destroyed caries . The infiltration technique arrest lesion progression seal porous surface restore damage avoid ongoing acidic damage tooth structure . Objective Assess clinical efficacy use Icon infiltrate initial lesion tooth surface exist contact surface posterior teeth mean stabilize diseased tooth structure arrest lesion development . Materials Methods One hundred fifty volunteer ( 19+ year ) two early lesion posterior teeth enrol clinical trial evaluate clinical efficacy infiltrate lesion compare current watch-and-wait approach combine good oral hygiene fluoride application . Each subject treat lesion control lesion . Only small early lesion without clinical sign surface cavitation select . The control lesions stabilize normal preventive regimen , treatment lesion infiltrate resin . Lesion status monitor every six month clinical examination well use annual radiograph . Clinical Significance Infiltrating caries lesion potential effective strategy strengthen damage tooth structure reduce caries progression without surgical intervention .</detailed_description>
