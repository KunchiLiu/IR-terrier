	<brief_summary>As kidney function decline , ability maintain water balance impair often treat hemodialysis . The removal excess water hemodialysis often lead sudden drop blood pressure cause symptom dizziness , light-headedness , cramping , chest pain . This sudden drop blood pressure link complication heart attack , stroke even death . Research focus different way prevent dangerous drop blood pressure hemodialysis . One way use blood volume monitor biofeedback technology monitor patient 's relative blood volume automatically reduce amount fluid remove blood volume low prevent drop blood pressure occur . This type biofeedback device currently available hemodialysis machine approach appeal , clear effective form biofeedback prevent drop blood pressure . We plan determine use biofeedback base change patient 's blood volume reduce number sudden drop blood pressure occur hemodialysis . To , compare patient treated technology current hemodialysis practice follow important adverse outcome . The result interest frequency hemodialysis session complicate sudden symptomatic drop blood pressure . We also plan monitor amount water different body compartment , blood pressure , blood pressure medication use , marker heart function , patient symptom quality life . We hope provide information technology reduce sudden drop blood pressure hemodialysis , associate rate serious disease death , improve patient quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjusting Fluid Removal Based Blood Volume Hemodialysis : A Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 22 week parallel group , randomize crossover trial determine effect blood volume monitoring , BVM , guide ultrafiltration ( UF ) biofeedback symptomatic intradialytic hypotension ( IDH ) episodes amongst IDH prone patient . The first part study ( Part 1 - Run-In/Dialysis Optimization Phase ) , eligible patient undergo four-week run-in phase . During period patient undergo comprehensive clinical assessment include , clinical weight assessment , anti-hypertensive medication review , dialysis prescription standardization . At end run-in phase , patient still meet eligibility criterion enter randomize cross-over phase . In part 2 ( Randomized Cross-Over Phase ) , patient randomize regular best clinical practice hemodialysis , HD ( without BVM-guided UF biofeedback ; control arm ) BVM-guided UF biofeedback ( intervention arm ) 8 week period . This follow two-week washout phase patient crossed second 8-week phase . The study conduct report follow Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) 2010 guideline .</detailed_description>
