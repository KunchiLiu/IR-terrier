	<brief_title>Preoperative Transarterial Chemoembolization Resectable HCC With Portal Venous Invasion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With various improvement interventional radiology , since 2005 practice guideline issue American Association Study Liver Diseases , transcatheter arterial chemoembolization become one available locoregional therapy HCC . Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization , generally perform intermediate-stage HCC patient , involve injection embolizing agent hepatic artery deprive tumor major nutrient source via embolization nutrient artery , result ischemic necrosis tumor . To prevent intrahepatic recurrence due portal vein invasion HCC tumor , therapeutic strategy preoperative TACE , postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy try . According late powerful evidence , however , preoperative TACE routinely recommend patient undergo hepatectomy treat resectable HCC , TACE may delay surgical treatment decrease resection volume liver , also may create missed opportunity surgical treatment . Rather subject patient invasive procedure put risk miss opportunity surgical treatment , may better select optimal candidate receive surgical resection . Recent study even show favorable long-term survival outcome HR well-selected case HCC PVTT . About whether preoperative transarterial chemoembolization available resectable hepatocellular carcinoma portal vein tumor thrombus , far , hardly report .</detailed_description>
