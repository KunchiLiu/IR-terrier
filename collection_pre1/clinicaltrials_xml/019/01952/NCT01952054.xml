	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn denosumab combination hormonal drug help lower number circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) patient breast cancer spread bone . The safety combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Denosumab Breast Cancer With Bone Mets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive denosumab needle skin Day 1 28-day study cycle . Starting Day 1 week 4 , also begin take hormonal drug . The study doctor choose hormonal drug receive base previous hormonal therapy breast cancer . The study doctor give instruction take hormonal drug . Study Visits : On Day 1 week 4 : - You physical exam - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw CTC test check immune system . - Urine collect test biomarker use measure rate bone breakdown . - If study doctor think need , PET scan , bone scan , MRI check status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Length Study : You may receive denosumab hormonal therapy combination 13 week . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End Study Visit : After last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 5 teaspoon ) draw CTC test check immune system . - Urine collect test biomarker use measure rate bone breakdown . - If study doctor think need , PET scan , bone scan , MRI check status disease . This investigational study . Denosumab FDA approve commercially available prevent bone-related event cause breast cancer spread bone . Using denosumab low CTCs patient breast cancer spread bone investigational . You may option continue denosumab study end . Up 35 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
