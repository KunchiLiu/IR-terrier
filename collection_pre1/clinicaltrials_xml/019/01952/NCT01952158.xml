	<brief_summary>Acquisition transmission MDROs healthcare facility major patient safety problem , afflict particular antibiotic-exposed immunodeficient patient population . MDRO-colonized patient require isolation reduce risk transmission patient , frequently develop infection colonize organism . Most clinically relevant MDROs carry gastrointestinal tract ; thus perirectal culture frequently surveillance method use screen pathogen . Surveillance identify MDRO colonization allow anticipation timely initiation effective treatment patient develop infection . The precise mode transmission within hospital know , contamination hand healthcare personnel , patient care equipment , healthcare environment think play major role transmit MDRO . Suboptimal hand hygiene lead transmission hand staff patient colonization gastrointestinal tract . Few study investigate intestinal colonization healthcare professional . Transmission bacteria healthcare personnel think occur primarily via contaminated hand ; wonder whether gastrointestinal carriage healthcare personnel also play role nosocomial spread . This study screen self-referred convenience sample 400 healthcare personnel contact patient patient culture specimens fecal carriage MDRO one point time . A control group 400 NIH employee contractor contact patient patient specimen also screen . Samples link questionnaire assess exposure staff member patient culture specimens know MDRO colonization infection . We use molecular typing technique link healthcare personnel isolate patient environmental isolates . Finally , study conduct way preserve great extent possible anonymity volunteer , use system alphanumeric identifier unman drop box specimen collection .</brief_summary>
