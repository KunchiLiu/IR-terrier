Existing data suggests CHD occur Sub-Saharan Africa frequencies similar rest world . In application , propose utilize unique advantage Sub-Saharan Africa - combination genetically diverse population world diminish environmental background effect ( i.e . low prevalence smoking , alcohol abuse , obesity comparison western country ) - good understand genetic basis congenital heart disease . We couple next generation genomic technique traditional gene discovery method investigate CHD two African country : Uganda Nigeria . The inclusion syndromic non-syndromic CHD observe population well careful phenotyping ( include echocardiography ) greatly enhance potential provide insight genetic architecture CHD African population . To accomplish , plan enroll family , member congenital heart malformation consistent error early human development research protocol .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study include affected individual affected/or unaffected family member . Family member include parent sibling . The goal obtain minimum trio ( affected parent ) increase probability find gene mutation . Clinical criterion inclusion define presence congenital cardiac malformation relate error early human development . The diagnosis congenital heart disease ( presence congenital cardiac malformation think related error early human development ) make cardiologist team base echocardiogram ( perform C.S. , A.B . E.E . ) , physical examination , medical history , review medical record . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent .</criteria>
