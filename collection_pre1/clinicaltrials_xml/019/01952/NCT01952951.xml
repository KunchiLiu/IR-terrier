	<brief_summary>The current standard treatment locally advanced rectal cancer ( clinical stage II III ) preoperative radiation chemotherapy ( CRT ) follow surgery . But approach suboptimal patient high risk feature ( deeply-seated tumor many regional lymph node involve ) associate recurrence . This study test hypothesis CRT follow chemotherapy surgery improve efficacy preoperative treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Chemoradiation Followed Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Downstaging rate CRT use fluoropyrimidine monotherapy usually 30-40 % .In MRI-defined high-risk patient , downstaging rate conventional fluoropyrimidine-based monotherapy radiation show . We assume downstaging rate chemoradiation arm ( control arm ) would 30 % , addition CapOx CRT ( experimental arm ) may increase downstaging rate 30 % 50 % . A sample size 52 patient per group need 85 % power detect downstaging rate = 50 % compare 30 % type I error rate 15 % . We perform one interim futility analysis half patient recruit evaluated primary endpoint . O'Brien-Fleming boundary consider . Therefore , 26 patient per arm evaluate , interim futility analysis perform , Z score interim less -0.09192 ( one-sided p-value great 0.5366192 ) , study stop futility . Considering 5 % follow-up loss , sample size 55 per arm ( total 110 patient ) study .</detailed_description>
