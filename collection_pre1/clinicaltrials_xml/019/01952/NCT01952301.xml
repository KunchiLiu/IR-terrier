	<detailed_description>A single-blind , randomize , control , split-mouth study 30 subject insufficient zone KT ( &lt; 2mm ) . The study utilize within subject treatment comparison design establish non-inferiority test ( CM ) versus control ( FGG ) therapy . The primary efficacy endpoint KT width 6-months . Secondary endpoint include traditional periodontal measure , clinical attachment , recession bleed probe . Patient report pain , discomfort esthetic satisfaction also record . Biopsies obtain 6-months .</detailed_description>
