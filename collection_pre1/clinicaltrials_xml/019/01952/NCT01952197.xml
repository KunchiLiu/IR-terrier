	<detailed_description>1 . Background The majority sudden death case cardiac origin occur unexpectedly , often outside hospital . Attwood et al . [ 1 ] estimate incidence survival EMS-treated OHCA Europe find , `` all-rhythm '' CA , incidence 37.72 per 100,000 person-years . Survival 10.7 % `` all-rhythm '' CA . If result apply European population , approximately 275,000 person would experience all-rhythm , EMS-treated OHCA , 29,000 person survive hospital discharge [ 1 ] . To resuscitate person , without neurological damage , various effort , describe four link chain survival ( early call , early CPR , early defibrillation early advance life support ) , optimal [ 2 ] . During last decade , quality continuity chest compression increasingly highlight [ 3 ] . The reason blood flow coronary perfusion cardiac arrest relate quality continuity chest compression [ 4 ] . A coronary perfusion pressure ( CPP ) 15mmHg , defibrillation , also appear necessary return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) [ 5 ] . Consequently , different method device improve blood flow heart ( coronary perfusion ) brain CPR , different type mechanical compressor impedance threshold device [ 6-9 ] , study . The initial CPR guideline [ 10-12 ] state `` elevation low extremity may promote venous return augment artificial circulation external cardiac compression '' . However , 1992 guideline [ 13 ] , statement remove . The reason decision lack clinical evidence . During last five year , debate PLR may improve outcome resuscitation manoeuvre CPR re-opened . According Préau et al . [ 14 ] , effect PLR equivalent rapid intravenous volume expander shift blood low extremity towards intra-thoracic compartment . A 45° leg elevation four minute increase right leave ventricular preload , definition , stroke volume , heart preload dependent [ 15 ] . This make PLR predictive fluid responsiveness among patient circulatory failure , e.g . sepsis acute pancreatitis [ 14-17 ] , recommend part haemodynamic monitoring recent international recommendation [ 18 ] . Other researcher also show benefit use PLR increase resistance blood flow [ 19 ] , thereby shift fluid low extremity central circulation [ 20 , 21 ] . The present study design base pilot study recently conduct Gothenburg , Sweden . This pilot study conclude 20° leg elevation CPR improved level end-tidal carbon dioxide ( EtCO2 ) CPR [ 22 ] . It previously conclude EtCO2 correlate well blood flow PLR induces increase descend aortic blood flow least 10 % echocardiographic sub-aortic flow least 12 % [ 23-26 ] . In study , EtCO2 show quantitatively predictive stroke volume [ 27 ] . EtCO2 also describe important value predict ROSC CPR quality [ 22 , 28 , 29 ] . The resuscitation Gothenburg pilot study perform use manual mechanical compression make LUCAS TM 2 ( Lund University Cardiac Assist System ) , effect PLR appear great manual compression . It possible speculate reason , EtCO2 value start high level mechanical group . The possible reason could `` active decompression '' create large preload . Dragoumanos et al . [ 30 ] find animal study coronary perfusion pressure ( CPP ) also increase PLR perform CPR auto-transfusion aorta PLR explanation . It unclear whether mechanism transfer human . The literature also include case report letter advocate PLR CPR [ 31 , 32 ] . However , study show PLR CPR increase survival conduct . 2 . Method design : A prospective , randomise , control trial patient ( &gt; 18 year ) receive out-of hospital CPR randomise envelope treat either PLR flat position . The ambulance crew use special folding stool , allow leg elevate 20 degree . The PLR manoeuvre need perform immediately ( within five minute ) arrival first ambulance . Leg elevation maintain patient receives chest compression CPR stop patient ROSC medical decision make interrupt manoeuvre . PLR perform angle 20 45 degree ( approximately 35 40 cm ) . An instruction video produce train prior study ; aim use specially design fold stool standardise intervention much possible . In start-up phase June 2013 April 2014 , study conduct City Tarragona surround area . In , 13 mobile unit ( 12 BLS one ALS unit ) attend ( attend ) start-up phase . Since April 2014 , 56 unit , whole province , participate study . The study continue three year . 3 . Patient selection randomization : Inclusion/exclusion Inclusion : All patient sex suffer out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest require CPR attend BLS and/or ALS unit Tarragona area . Exclusion : Patients age &lt; 18 exclude study . Allocation concealment ensure via opaque , number seal envelope . The random allocation list generate web-based automate randomization system . To guarantee numeric balance across condition randomisation perform separately random permute block hundred . The allocation list keep remote secure location independent person randomly allocate envelope . 4 . Endpoints : Primary end-point : survival one month Secondary end-point : survival hospital admission one month one year acceptable cerebral performance classification ( CPC ) 1-2 [ 33 ] 5 . Evaluation result : Sub-group analysis : result also analyse relation rhythm ( shockable/non- shockable rhythm ) , age ( less 65 year ) , gender ambulance delay ( le 10 minute ) . Statistical analysis Group comparison ( PLR/flat position ) perform use Fisher 's non-parametric permutation test , Mann-Whitney U test continuous/ordered variable Fisher 's exact test dichotomous variable . All test two-tailed p-values 0.05 consider statistically significant . 6 . Study time : April 1 , 2012 -Mars 31 2015 ( Sweden ) Jun 8 , 2013 - Jun 2016 ( Catalonia )</detailed_description>
