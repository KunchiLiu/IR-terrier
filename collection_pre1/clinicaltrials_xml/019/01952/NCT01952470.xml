	<brief_summary>Patients undergone lung transplantation increase risk develop chest infection due long-term medication suppress immune response . In chronic lung disease cystic fibrosis ( CF ) bronchiectasis , inhale , nebulised mucolytic medication dornase alpha isotonic saline often use part management lung disease characterize increase retained secretion . These agent act make easy clear airway secretion , currently use case-by-case basis post lung transplantation . To investigator knowledge , agent evaluate via robust scientific investigation use post lung transplant , yet widely use routine practice . Patients post lung transplant must investigate separately exhibit difference physiology make clearance sputum potentially difficult compare lung disease . Lower respiratory tract infection lead cause hospital re-admission post lung transplant . Therefore , highlight need randomize controlled trial . The aim study assess efficacy dornase alpha , compare isotonic saline , management low respiratory tract infection post lung transplant . Investigators hypothesize dornase alpha effective isotonic saline . The effect daily dose dornase alpha isotonic saline compare treatment period 1 month . Patients admit hospital suffer chest infection characterize sputum production post lung transplant eligible study inclusion . Patients follow 3 month total analyze short-medium term last effect . Investigators wish monitor physiological change within lung non-invasively via lung function analysis whilst assess patient perceive benefit via cough specific quality life questionnaire . These measure take study inclusion repeat 1 month 3 month . Day day monitoring perform via patient symptom diary , incorporate hospital length stay exacerbation rate . The outcome study potential guide clinical decision-making highlight safe efficacious therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preliminary Study Dornase Alpha Treat Chest Infections Post Lung Transplant .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According International Society Heart Lung Transplantation ( ISHLT ) , incidence lung transplant per annum worldwide rise annually , 3000 transplant complete accord late registry ( 1 ) . The Alfred state-wide , internationally renowned lung transplant service , transplant 59 - 79 patient last two calendar year , wait-list 40 potential recipient . This make one 7 centre worldwide complete volume transplant ( 1 ) . Patients undergone lung transplantation end-stage lung disease subject life-long immunosuppression prevent allograft rejection . These patient heighten risk acquire opportunistic low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) ( 2 ) , often characterize sputum retention / production , negative impact morbidity mortality ( 3 ) . Patients post lung transplant often find difficult clear secretion due alteration normal physiology . Transplanted lung tissue denervated upon resection donor , show lead slower cilial beat frequency ( 4 ) , impaired muco-ciliary clearance ( MCC ) rate ( 4-6 ) impair cough reflex ( 7 ) . Devascularisation lung tissue post ischaemic surgical time acute period lead alteration mucosal property structural change around anastomosis , may impair ability clear secretion ( 3 ) . Inhaled , nebulised mucolytic agent commonly use management suppurative chronic lung diseases characterized excessive production secretion . Dornase alpha act digest extracellular DNA release inflammatory cell infection ( 8 ) . It show positive long-term effect lung function cystic fibrosis ( CF ) ( 8 ) short-term benefit treat atelectasis mucous plug acute , non-CF adult paediatric case ( 9-11 ) . Yet show safe normal subject ( 8 ) , show detrimental effect pulmonary function non-CF bronchiectasis ( 12 ) . Inhaled saline act restore airway surface liquid layer mucosa , favorably alter mucous property , accelerate MCC stimulating cough ( 13-14 ) . Positive evidence exist hypertonic saline ( 6-7 % ) CF ( 13-14 ) hypertonic isotonic ( 0.9 % ) saline non-CF bronchiectasis ( 15 ) . There discussion clinical use saline mucolytic post transplant patient ( 16 ) evidence way randomize controlled trial demonstrate effect . There current evidence use inhale mucolytics post transplant . Currently , dornase alpha saline ( isotonic / hypertonic ) use inpatient outpatient set institution reactive treatment strategy LRTI characterize excessive sputum production / retention . The investigator believe warrant short-term , randomized trial ass efficacy current practice , evaluate whether dornase alpha effective 0.9 % saline , cheap , accessible alternative . Aim To evaluate efficacy inhaled dornase alpha compare inhaled isotonic ( 0.9 % ) saline : - Quantitative qualitative respiratory outcome - The need antibiotic , length stay exacerbation / re-admission rate Hypothesis Dornase alpha effective isotonic saline post lung transplant population LRTI . Study design Phase 2 , assessor blind , prospective randomize controlled trial . Intervention On admission ward inpatient , patient give informed consent within 48 hour initial presentation randomly assign one two group define . The randomization sequence conceal use opaque envelope . Randomization stratify accord pre-transplant diagnosis ( cystic fibrosis ) people cystic fibrosis expect younger different underlie systemic disease process . All participant undertake treatment one month accord allocate group , follow 3 month , ( 2 month randomize intervention ) . Both group continue regular prescribed physical exercise routine course study . Timing assessment All outcome measure perform study baseline , 1 month 3 month follow-up . Daily outcome measure use monitoring diary exception . There cough-specific quality life questionnaire validate use post lung transplant population . Sample size power calculation A total 30 participant ( 15 group ) enter study . The probability 80 percent study detect treatment difference two-sided 0.05 significance level , true difference treatment 1.000 unit LCI . This conservative estimate small previous difference find paediatric population ( 17-18 ) . This base assumption standard deviation response variable 0.94 unit ( 17-18 ) . As phase 2 study , project power detect difference physiological outcome , rather quality life hospitalization . However , treatment prove physiological benefit , secondary outcome study provide critical information power future phase 3 trial . Feasibility : Approximately 12 patient pulmonary exacerbation admit lung transplant service month ( minimum estimate ) . Investigators estimate 70 % meet eligibility criterion study 50 % consent participate . It therefore anticipate possible recruit number need study 8 month . Statistical analysis An intention treat analysis conduct , inclusion randomize participant , regardless study completion . Data continuous outcome include LCI analyze use linear mixed model analysis , make use available data time point less affected incomplete data analysis variance . The likelihood exacerbation hospitalization follow-up period dornase alpha group express relative risk compare isotonic saline group . Bias / Confounders There potential performance bias study due lack ability blind participant allocate treatment regimen . Investigators unable package medication way currently produce . It aim outline , part PICF , inhale medication proven efficacious ( detrimental certain circumstance ) disease process post lung transplant LRTI . Detection bias control use blind outcome assessor follow-up data collection point . Potential confounders study include diagnosis bronchiolitis obliterans ( BOS ) , chronic lung rejection , LRTI occur simultaneously . Patients diagnosis BOS may fact demonstrate difference lung physiology ease sputum expectoration , may effect outcome variable . We feel exclude patient may detrimental impact external validity study , therefore stratify patient accord diagnosis BOS study inclusion . Outcomes Significance This first randomize control trial analyze inhale dornase alpha isotonic saline post lung transplant population . The outcome trial help guide physiotherapy pharmacological management post lung transplant patient LRTI future , nationally internationally .</detailed_description>
