	<brief_summary>The study perform determine whether probiotic ( GoodBelly ) improve blood vessel function.Probiotics similar yogurt live micro-organism ( beneficial host ) live intestine . Patients coronary artery disease enrol study . The research result use determine type bacteria present intestine play role pathogenesis cardiovascular disease . Patients coronary artery disease enrol 12 week . Patients take probiotic 6 week . Following 6 week period washout period 4 week , optional antibiotic study call vancomycin . Patients take vancomycin 10 day . Blood vessel function measure ultrasound probiotic supplement vancomycin antibiotic . Blood also take evaluate marker inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan recruit 20 patient , men coronary artery disease , single center , interventional trial Probiotic-GoodBelly follow Vancomycin . The study include 6 total visit . Subjects pass phone screen invite screen visit study eligibility ( Visit 1 ) Informed consent review ; unique study number assign write informed consent obtain ( subject assign 1 allocation number ) ; relevant participant medical history record include currently prescribe medication ; anthropometric measurement take ( height , weight , waist circumference metric unit ) blood pressure record ( measure triplicate average ) . Subjects allowed take blood pressure medication morning screen visit , morning study visit limit acute influence medication endothelial function . If potential participant qualifies study , return 1 week screen study visit ( Visit 2 ) turn stool sample , undergo initial test endothelial function receive 3 week supply GoodBelly Probiotic . After 3 week return ( Visit 3 ) another 3 week supply probiotic . After total 6 week take probiotic return ( Visit 4 ) stool sample . He ask fast 6-8 hour prior visit limit acute dietary influence vascular endothelial function . During Visit 4 , endothelial function determine brachial artery reactivity test His stool sample collect blood sample also take visit systemic measurement inflammatory marker . If agrees optional Vancomycin study . He return 4 week ( Visit 5 ) . He ask fast 6-8 hour prior visit limit acute dietary influence vascular endothelial function . At Visit 5 , endothelial function determine brachial artery reactivity test His stool sample collect blood sample also take visit systemic measurement inflammatory marker . He give 10 day supply vancomycin . After 10 day return ( Visit 6 ) stool sample . At Visit 6 , endothelial function determine brachial artery reactivity test . His stool sample collect blood sample also take visit systemic measurement inflammatory marker .</detailed_description>
