	<brief_summary>The objective clinical investigation evaluate early mid-term outcome ( 6 12 month ) long-term ( 24 month ) outcome Zilver PTX paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Cook ) versus bypass surgery treatment TASC C &amp; D femoropopliteal lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Cook Zilver PTX Drug-eluting Stent Versus Bypass Surgery Treatment The Cook Zilver PTX Drug-eluting Stent Versus Bypass Surgery Femoropopliteal TASC C &amp; D Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A global noticeable tendency increase prevalence peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . Approximately 27 million people Europe North America affect PAD . Risk factor attain high prevalence include age , obesity , nicotine abuse , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes family history . PAD present asymptomatically symptomatically intermittent claudication ( IC ) critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) . The conservative treatment PAD comprise smoke cessation , exercise management risk factor associate disease . However , medical intervention indicate patient present disable IC , CLI case conservative treatment afford relief . The Inter-Society Consensus Management PAD ( TASC II ) publish overview different category PAD . The TASC II recommendation treatment femoral popliteal lesion show Figure 1 . For TASC A &amp; B lesion , endovascular treatment preferred TASC C &amp; D lesion , surgical treatment prefer . The surgical treatment prosthetic bypass yield good result numerous trial . Berglund , Björck Elfström ( 2005 ) conduct retrospective study 499 patient assess . These patient receive above-knee femoropopliteal bypass saphenous vein graft ( 139 subject ) ePTFE graft ( 360 subject ) . Primary patency 12 month 87 % 75 % venous bypass prosthetic bypass respectively . Jensen et al . ( 2007 ) investigate 427 patient randomized trial patient underwent above-knee femoropopliteal bypass . Eventually , 205 patient receive PTFE bypass graft 208 receive Dacron bypass graft ( 14 patient exclude ) . The primary patency rate 12 month 70 % 78 % PTFE Dacron respectively . Kedora et al . ( 2007 ) compare 86 patient ( 100 limb ) femoropopliteal artery occlusive disease randomize trial . 50 limb treat angioplasty one self-expanding stent graft , 50 limb treat synthetic Dacron ePTFE bypass graft . After 12 month , primary patency bypass group 74.2 % . In similar study setup , McQuade , Gable , Hohman , Pearl &amp; Theune ( 2009 ) study 100 limb 86 patient superficial femoral artery occlusive disease . 50 limb treat angioplasty one stent graft , randomize 50 limb treat synthetic Dacron ePTFE bypass graft . The bypass arm study primary patency 12 month 77 % . A total 27 patient TASC D lesion superficial femoral artery analyze Hines , Wain , Montecalvo &amp; Feuerman ( 2010 ) . All patient receive bypass endoscopic saphenous vein . After 12 month primary patency 73.2 % . At LINC congress Bosiers ( 2012 ) present analysis 100 surgical primary patent bypass . Surgical primary patency measure assess flow bypass . Endovascular primary patency measure absence binary restenosis ( PSV≥2.4 ) , assess proximal distal anastomosis . A total 89 % surgical primary patent bypass evaluate endovascular patent . This analysis show margin approximately 10 % take account interpret primary patency surgical bypass . Dake et al . ( 2011 ) examine 900 lesion superficial popliteal artery treat one Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent . The mean lesion length 99.5 ( ±82.1 ) mm primary patency 12 month 86.2 % . Comparison surgical bypass endovascular approach femoropopliteal lesion study set-up use many time . To date , randomize control bypass new drug-eluting technology conduct . The purpose trial compare result prosthetic bypass treatment Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent treatment . Historical data primary patency bypass result , take 10 % difference surgical endovascular patency account , give endovascular primary patency approximately 70 % . In non-inferiority trial , propose primary patency Zilver PTX drug-eluting stent set 80 % show treatment drug-eluting stent comparable treatment prosthetic bypass .</detailed_description>
