	<brief_title>The Effects Anti-microbial Spray Dressing Preventing Tenckhoff Catheter Exit Site Infection End Stage Renal Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods The study conduct use randomize controlled trial . Sampling The subject patient Tenckhoff Catheter recruit renal team regional acute hospital satellite dialysis centre . The sample method convenience sample . The subject recruit sequentially insertion Tenckhoff Catheter . Inclusion criterion - Patient establish Tenckhoff Catheter least 3 month - Patient skin condition heal satisfactorily Exclusion criterion - Patient present sign symptom exit site infection e.g . purulent discharge , pain , swab exit culture positive growth . - Patient unhealed exit site . - Patient currently require antibiotic - Patient show sensitive JUC Spray Dressing 0.05 % Chlorhexidine solution ( A ) Control group Care Tenckhoff catheter exit site use 0.05 % Chlorhexidine solution ( Guidelines care peritoneal catheter exit site , Renal Unit , QEH ) . The detailed procedure introduce nurse accord protocol unit . Please refer Appendix II detail . Skin test 0.05 % Chlorhexidine carry prior usage Chlorhexidine solution care exit site . For first three day patient discharge , study team member perform telephone follow . Patients remind report sign symptoms infection physical damage catheter note . A routine follow Renal Unit arrange eight week interval . ( B ) Intervention group Care peritoneal catheter exit site use spray dressing . The detailed procedure introduce nurse accord protocol unit . Please refer Appendix III detail . Data collection Quantitative data collection demographic data , time insertion Peritoneal Catheter , history allergy would collect patient 's record . The condition exit site monitor daily patient / carer . They teach report nurse abnormality note sign symptoms infection , skin allergy damage catheter . A comprehensive nursing assessment carry 8 week interval monthly 6 month . Data analysis The data analyze use PASW . The demographic data report use mean standard deviation . Independent sample t-test use compare difference group . P &lt; 0.05 set significant difference . Ethical Considerations All patient participate study voluntary base . Before launch study , ethical approval Research Ethical Committee , The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Ethical Committee , Kowloon Central Cluster obtain . A detailed explanation research objectives different intervention provide patient verbally information sheet . After pass skin test allergy reaction , patient agree participate need sign consent form . During data collection , research code assign subject name appear research documentation ensure confidentiality . The data access research team member . Furthermore , Research Ethical Committee ( REC ) Regulatory Authority study hospital grant direct access subject 's study data data verification . The Research Ethical Committee spot check clinical area study period ensure research ethic adhere good clinical practice maintain throughout study .</detailed_description>
