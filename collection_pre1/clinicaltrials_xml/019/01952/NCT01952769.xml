	<brief_title>Anti PD1 Antibody Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) lethal pediatric malignant disease . Children usually diagnose age 6-8 year follow short history neurological deterioration often combination cranial nerve dysfunction , ataxia long tract deficit . Diagnosis MRI base biopsy require tumor feature image non-classic . As today curative treatment regardless multiple clinical trial do past . Following diagnosis child undergo radiation therapy aim symptom alleviation , almost inevitable disease progression take place several month later . Overall survival range 9-12 month death due disease progression rule ( 1 ) 2 . Relapsed high grade glioma- close accrual 3 . Immunotherapy brain tumor Data regard possible role immune system cancer first present 2001 Schreiber Old demonstrate lymphocyte , activate interferon-γ , inhibit development spontaneous carcinogen-induced tumor immunodeficient mouse ( Shankaran et al , 2001 ) . Later study demonstrate progressively decrease immunogenicity tumor cell advance cancer patient . Based data trial incorporate immunotherapy treatment relapse high grade glioma construct . Past trial center upon active cell base immunization try present patient ' immune system specific antigens derived tumor use different technique enhance immune response . These study show positive result need prepare patient specific vaccination limit use highly specialized center result hard reproduce . ( 3 ) 4 . The role PD-1 cancer immunotherapy One mechanism tumor cell escape immune detection activation inhibitory lymphocyte receptor PD-1 ( program death 1 ) . Low grade activation T cell receptor-secondary prolonged antigen exposure ( find chronic disease protract exposure malignant cell ) - strongly activates- PD-1 . Upon activation , PD-1 drive lymphocyte towards apoptosis reduces cytokine production . PD-1/PD-1 ligand interaction promote tolerance immune system specific antigen ( 4 ) . Lately , study report high level PD-1 expression tumor infiltrate lymphocyte , strong expression PD-ligand within multiple tumor type include high grade glioma .Both finding support data regard role PD1 cancer immune escape ( 5 ) . 5 . Anti PD-1 : Safety efficacy human study Over last two year data accumulate regard efficacy toxicity profile anti PD-1.Topalian et.al report 2012 outcome large phase I study evaluate antiPD-1 advance cancer . Out 296 participate patient 14 % Grade 3 4 drug-related adverse event treat outpatient setup . Several patient diagnose pneumonitis . Most observed treat successfully steroid three patient die . Among 236 patient response could evaluate , objective response ( complete partial response ) observe non-small-cell lung cancer-a cancer know immunoresponsive ( 18 % ) , melanoma ( 28 % ) , renal-cell cancer ( 27 % ) . Responses durable ; 20 31 response last 1 year ( 6 ) . Further study report good toxicity profile similar efficacy . Hamid et.al report outcome 135 patient advanced melanoma . Side effect mostly grade 1-2 treatment related mortality . Response rate among patient 38 % response last least 7 month ( 7 ) . A study evaluate anti PD-1 chronic HCV patient reveal similar safe profile . One patient 66 ( 10 mg/kg ) experience asymptomatic grade 4 ALT elevation coincident onset 4-log viral load reduction . Six patient exhibit immune-related adverse event mild-to-moderate intensity , include two case hyperthyroidism consistent autoimmune thyroiditis ( 8 ) . 6 . Anti CTLA-4 anti PD-1 activity brain tumor Unlike chemotherapy target therapy , antiCTLA-4 anti PD-1 affect T lymphocytes rather tumor . Binding lymphocyte receptor may take place outside central nervous system . Following bind receptor reactivate lymphocyte penetrate brain arrive tumor thus antibody require cross blood brain barrier . Data regard activity antiCTLA-4 within brain may retrieve retrospective summary melanoma patient brain metastasis . These patient usually ineligible clinical trial due grim prognosis . Margolin e al report partial response 5 patient stable disease 12 week another 4 51 patient asymptomatic brain melanoma metastasis . Patients symptomatic lesion require steroid therapy respond . Di Giacomo report disease stabilization 5 near total response another 5 patient 20 patient asymptomatic metastatic melanoma lesion . These data provide proof principle assumption regimen active within brain . Zeng et al report improved survival glioblastoma implant mouse follow radiation anti PD-1 . Median survival 25 day control arm , 27 day anti-PD-1 antibody arm , 28 day radiation arm , 53 day radiation plus anti-PD-1 therapy arm , data along tolerability treatment call clinical trial assess treatment population extremely poor prognosis ( 9 ) . 7 . MDV9300 mechanism action early efficacy data MDV9300 one several humanize anti PD1 antibody currently investigation multiple tumor . A single dose MDV9300 give mouse metastatic melanoma , fibrosarcoma , lung carcinoma colorectal adenocarcinoma lead significant reduction lung and/or liver metastasis along prolonged survival . Combination MDV9300 rituximab , chemotherapy different type vaccine proven synergistic . In phase I study enrol 17 patient advanced stage hematological malignancy ( AML , CLL , Non-Hodgkin lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease multiple myeloma ) 5 patient prolonged stable disease ( average 60 week ) one patient follicular lymphoma complete response . A Phase II study conduct 72 adult patient DLBCL follow autologous stem cell transplantation ; study , MDV9300 give dose 1.5 mg/kg per patient 3 cycle per patient every 42 day ( treatment Days 1 , 43 , 85 ) . The PFS OS 18 month transplant 72 % 85 % , respectively . These value compare favorably result obtain previous similar cohort . In addition , ORR within 40 patient enrol study measurable disease 45 % ( 30 % CR , 15 % PR ) . A Phase II study conduct 30 adult patient rituximab-sensitive , grade 1-2 follicular lymphoma relapse 1-4 prior therapy measurable disease . MDV9300 administer 3 mg/kg IV every 4 week 12 infusion rituximab dose 375 mg/m2 IV weekly 4 week start 2 week first infusion MDV9300 . Of 29 patient eligible efficacy analysis , 19 objective response ORR 66 % . CR observe 15 ( 52 % ) PR 4 ( 14 % ) . Altogether , 25 ( 86 % ) patient measurable tumor regression . The ORR 66 % CR rate 52 % compare favorably previously report ORR 40 % CR rate 11 % single agent rituximab retreatment relapse follicular lymphoma . Median time response 88 day . Of note , 17 % patient achieve initial response &gt; 3 month first treatment . Median PFS 19.6 month , reach 19 responder 25 patient measurable tumor regression . H. first part study eight patient enrol . A total 73 cycle MDV9300 ( range 2- 16 ) apply . Treatment well tolerate , mild moderate fatigue experience 10 % patient follow treatment ( 7 cycle ) . Nine cycle follow neutropenia ( CTCEA grade 1-3 ) . No patient diagnose neutropenia less 500 cell /mm3 . The grade 3 adverse event single event transient blood pressure MDV9300 infusion . Median overall survival 13 month ( 6-19 month ) 50 % survival 1 year . CONCLUSION : Anti PD1 treatment well-tolerated therapy possible activity DIPG .</detailed_description>
