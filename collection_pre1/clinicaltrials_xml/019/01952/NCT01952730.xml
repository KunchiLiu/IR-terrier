	<brief_summary>This study Pilot clinical trial . Pilot clinical trial test safety investigational combination drug . Pilot study provide information effect , good bad , Investigational agent might disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve treatment type cancer . The main purpose study determine : - The amount vaccine make colorectal tumor cell - If vaccine give safely - What effect vaccine , good bad - How vaccine affect immune system - Whether vaccine might effect return cancer liver surgical removal This study do currently treatment demonstrate cure diseae progress , move beyond site primary site disease ( colon rectum ) . These vaccination give complete standard care treatment determine doctor . Laboratory research make vaccine cancer cell insert genetic material protein call granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) cancer cell . Once complete , cancer cell able produce large amount GM-CSF . The vaccine make form cell great anti-tumor effect cancer cell without GM-CSF . The purpose research study determine safety investigational vaccine make use colorectal cancer cell manner describe . This vaccine use several research study treatment cancer ( skin , lung , ovarian , sarcoma leukemia . ) Information research study suggest vaccine may help reduce risk colorectal cancer return colorectal cancer surgery . Due result melanoma several tumor encourage use vaccine approach patient liver metastasis colorectal cancer , cancer liver remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After give consent participate study , study doctor perform test confirm eligible participate . These test may take place 21 day surgery remove liver tumor , use create vaccine . Many follow examination commonly do determine diagnosis and/or stage disease may already evaluations . They may may repeat . These test include medical history , performance status , blod sample , routine blood test , tumor assessment blood pregnancy test ( applicable ) . If test indicate eligible study agree participate , refer surgeon surgical removal tumor tissue vaccine make . The surgery perform Massachusetts General Hospital . You ask sign separate consent form give permission surgeon perform operation . That consent describe risk operation involve remove tumor cell liver . After surgery , possibility physician recommend treatment start vaccine feel would beneficial care medically appropriate . This part treatment would experimental ( example , chemotherapy radiation therapy ) . Then , case , vaccine make cancer administer least 4 week last chemotherapy radiation treatment . If time operation first schedule vaccine injection 8 week longer , ask undergo another chest , abdomen pelvic CT scan clinical blood work confirm still safe proceed vaccine . After 4 week rest period , vaccine administration occur previously outline . If test indicate eligible study agree participate , refer surgeon surgical removal tumor tissue vaccine make . It important know sometimes unable collect enough cell tumor collection . In case try grow tumor cell short period time get enough cell make vaccine , guarantee always able produce vaccine every participant undergoes tumor cell collection . The vaccine create colorectal cancer cell schedule give day 1 , 8 , 15 every two week 6 total vaccine administer . The amount vaccine dependent total amount cell collect colorectal cancer liver metastasis process prepared vaccine lab . It hop receive least six vaccine . All scheduled treatment occur outpatient clinic . The vaccine administer two injection place underneath skin . The two injection give place body . The recommended site arm , thigh trunk area site rotate per vaccine . Day 1 first day treatment study . The following procedure plan day : update medical history , physical exam , blood sample routine lab , require blood sample immune study , vaccine administration , , enough cell grow , receive injection cancer cell kill able secrete GM-CSF . This do measure amount reaction immune system cause vaccine alone . Punch biopsy obtain 2 day first fifth vaccination . A DTH injection also administer first fifth vaccine . Two day vaccine DTH administration punch biopsy take . DTH injection Delayed-type Hyper-sensitivity Tests . This injection insert small amount vaccine skin determine allergic reaction vaccine . This consist small piece skin tissue remove local anesthesia . A small stitch place biopsy . You sign separate consent form procedure . The following procedure plan Days 8 15 : update medical history , weight vital sign , blood sample routine lab immune study , vaccine administration . On day 29 every two week ( vaccine available ) wil undergo update medical history , physical exam , weight vital sign , blood sample routine lab immune study , punch biopsy vaccine administration . With vaccine # 5 , may receive second DTH injection . Two day vaccine DTH injection , punch biopsy take site evaluate body 's response treatment . After final dose study drug , treat physician determine eligible receive second series vaccination . In addition , must sufficient number cell vaccine remain original harvest new liver metastasis occur removed make vaccine . If give consent participate repeat dose phase , require repeat screen test see still eligible participate study . It possible additional round vaccine therapy may offer second round , long appropriate opinion treat physician additional tumor available make vaccine continue meet eligibility criterion . Participants monitor every 3 month blood test first 3 year every 6-12 month total 5 year . Staging CT scan perform 3 month last vaccination , every 6 month first three year yearly year 5 . After 5 year image discretion treat physician . Blood draw immune research study occur every 3 month 2 year complete vaccination .</detailed_description>
