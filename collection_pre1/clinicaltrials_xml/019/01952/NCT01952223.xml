	<detailed_description>Eligible patient randomize via TENALEA web site process insure centralization randomization . Randomization perform accord 1:1:1:1 ratio . The randomization stratify ( minimization ) accord number risk factor ( 2 vs.3 ) , disease extent ( pN- vs. pN+ vs. pNx ) site . The minimization define similar weight 3 stratification factor probability assign treatment minimize imbalance equal 80 % . The main analysis PFS event driven ( &gt; 247 event ) . It likely perform median follow-up approximately 6 year , i.e . 4 year inclusion last patient ( assume accrual 4 year ) . A long-term analysis ( allow robust PFS OS data ) also perform follow-up approximately 10 year . Its exact timing discuss steer committee IDMC . An interim analysis primary endpoint plan . This interim analysis perform 0.001 level ( Peto ) 50 % event i.e . 125 occur . For comparison ( CT comparison pelvic RT comparison ) two PFS curve compare use adjust logrank test ( bilateral test ) : adjust logrank pelvic RT CT comparison CT pelvic RT comparison . A multivariate analysis use Cox model also use . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) compose international expert ( least 2 physician 1 statistician ) select . For safety purpose , IDMC meet inclusion 20 patient ( accrual 50 patient ) cabazitaxel pelvic radiotherapy arm , assess tolerance , ( i.e . inclusion approximately 80 200 patient trial ) . Depending result feasibility phase new relevant clinical result population , remain patient ( n=848 ) enrol . During second phase , IDMC meet every two year approximately accrual carefully assess accrual rate toxicity examine efficacy interim analysis result light result similar trial .</detailed_description>
