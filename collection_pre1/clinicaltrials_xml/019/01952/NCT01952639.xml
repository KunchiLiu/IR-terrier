	<brief_summary>Rationale : The progressive loss skeletal muscle mass aging , sarcopenia , major impact health care system due increase morbidity great need hospitalization and/or institutionalization . One way prevent skeletal muscle loss improve dietary intake elderly . Both whey casein seem offer anabolic advantage soy protein promote muscle hypertrophy . As consequence assume ( ) plant base protein less potent anabolic property compare animal base protein . However , little theoretical background assumption . Objective : To provide evidence efficacy wheat protein wheat protein hydrolysate compare milk protein ( i.e . whey casein ) dietary protein stimulate postprandial muscle protein synthesis vivo healthy old human . Study design : double-blind , placebo-controlled intervention study Study population : 60 healthy non-obese ( BMI 18.5-30 kg/m2 ) old male ( age : 65-80 ) Intervention : A protein beverage ( 350 mL ) contain 30 g whey , casein , wheat protein , wheat protein hydrolysate 60 g wheat protein hydrolysate consume ( n=12 per group ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary study parameter include muscle protein synthesis rate . Secondary study parameter include whole-body protein synthesis , breakdown , oxidation , net balance . Hypotheses : We hypothesize ingestion wheat protein hydrolysate result great muscle protein synthetic response compare intact wheat protein due fast digestion absorption . Furthermore , ingestion wheat protein hydrolysate result higher muscle protein synthetic response compare casein , low compare whey protein . Ingestion 60 g wheat protein hydrolysate ( amount leucine equal 30 g whey protein ) result similar muscle protein synthetic response compare ingestion 30 g whey protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aging accompany progressive decline skeletal muscle mass . This age-related loss muscle mass , sarcopenia , attribute imbalance muscle protein synthesis breakdown . As basal muscle protein synthesis rate seem differ young elderly , research focus potential impairment muscle protein synthetic response main anabolic stimulus , i.e . food intake exercise . Skeletal muscle protein synthesis highly responsive food intake healthy young adult . Recent data indicate muscle protein synthetic response food intake may blunt elderly . This propose anabolic resistance regard key factor etiology sarcopenia . Effective strategy prevent and/or counteract age-related loss muscle mass include protein supplementation , preferably combination resistance exercise . Recent study show efficacy dietary protein supplementation improve muscle strength function frail elderly augment gain muscle mass function combine resistance exercise . As consequence , nutrition research look optimal amount , type , time protein consumption maximize postprandial muscle protein synthesis rate . Improvements protein balance and/or high muscle protein synthesis rate report follow ingestion various type dietary protein : whey , casein , soy , casein hydrolysate , egg protein , whole-milk and/or fat-free milk . It seem obvious question source dietary protein effective promote muscle protein synthesis . There limited research compare efficacy ingestion different protein source protein synthetic response . As , difficult identify specific protein source potentiating . This complicated fact numerous parameter modulate muscle protein synthetic response protein ingestion . The amount time protein administration , amino acid composition protein , digestion absorption kinetics protein source ( mixed meal ) , may modulate muscle protein synthetic response . Milk protein , i.e . whey casein , widely study dietary protein . Casein whey seem distinct anabolic property , attribute difference digestion absorption kinetics . Whey protein soluble protein lead fast intestinal absorption , whereas intact casein clot stomach delay digestion absorption subsequent release amino acid circulation . The faster , transient rise plasma amino acid concentration whey protein ingestion lead high protein synthesis rate . In addition intrinsic difference digestion absorption rate , suggest whey protein effectively stimulate protein synthesis due great leucine content compare casein . Both whey casein seem offer anabolic advantage soy protein promote muscle hypertrophy . As consequence assume ( ) plant base protein less potent anabolic property compare animal base protein . However , little theoretical background assumption . In study ass capacity wheat protein ingestion mean increase postprandial muscle protein synthesis vivo human . By directly compare anabolic property wheat protein wheat protein hydrolysate casein whey , determine anabolic property wheat protein ( hydrolysate ) vivo old human .</detailed_description>
