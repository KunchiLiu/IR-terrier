	<brief_summary>Despite remarkable achievement neonatal survival preterm infant low birth weight ( VLBW , birth weight &lt; 1,500 g ) past three decade , improvement produce little change prevalence severe developmental disability rate low severity dysfunction ( e.g. , learn disability , low IQ , attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder , specific neuropsychological deficit , poor perceptual-motor skill internalize behavioral problem ) remain high 50 % 70 % . Few intervention program develop preterm infant Western society show short- long-term benefit certain cognitive function , however rare study investigate intervention effect school age explore plausible neurological pathway effective intervention . This three-year study therefore aim extend previous research longitudinally examine effectiveness three intervention program ( clinic-based intervention program [ CBIP ] , home-based intervention program [ HBIP ] usual care program [ UCP ] ) VLBW preterm child Taiwan seven year age . ( The intervention deliver birth one year correct age previous study . Intervention give study . ) The CBIP HBIP contain similar child- parent-focused service well interaction activity respectively deliver clinic CBIP home HBIP . A total 178 VLBW preterm infant randomly assign CBIP , HBIP UCP . Sixty-two gender maternal education level match term child normal birth weight also include serve reference group comparison developmental outcomes . Effectiveness examine include child parent outcome . The long-term effect early intervention preterm child provide important information help medical professional public policy maker develop effective intervention Taiwanese preterm child risk developmental disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : This study extend previous research longitudinally examine effectiveness three intervention program ( CBIP , HBIP UCP ) VLBW preterm child Taiwan seven year age . Gender maternal education level match term child also include serve reference group comparison developmental outcomes . The intervention deliver birth one year correct age previous study . Effectiveness examine include child parent outcome . Primary outcome refers measure child neurobehavioral neurophysiological function . Neurobehavioral assessment include cognitive , motor behavioral measurement . Neurophysiological assessment refers electroencephalogram/event-related potential examination use investigate neurological pathway underlie effective intervention . Secondary outcome refer child growth health , quality parenting measure . Subjects Methods : Participants : One hundred seventy-eight VLBW preterm child 62 term child participate previous study enrol present study . VLBW preterm child bear admitted National Taiwan University Hospital , Mackay Memorial Hospital Taipei City Hospital , Branch Women Children Taipei , Taiwan , time period 2006 2008 . Methods : While age seven important time period child enters elementary school begin participate school activity , comprehensive outcome measurement require . The World Health Organization emphasize health condition consider body , individual societal perspective depict International Classification Functioning , Disability Health model . Accordingly , outcome measure study consist primary ( i.e. , child neurobehavioral neurophysiological function ) secondary outcome ( i.e. , child growth health , quality parenting ) . Child neurobehavioral assessment include measurement cognitive , motor , behavior function . The domain cognitive function examine include intelligence ( IQ test ) , efficiency attention control ( sustain attention test ) , cognitive flexibility planning ( executive function test ) . Motor function include motor skill acquisition coordination . Child behavior measure use parental report child behavior teacher 's observation child 's adaptive behavior school context . Child educational resource ( special education resource class ) education-related support receive outside school also record study . Child neurophysiological function measure electroencephalogram ( EEG ) /event-related potential ( ERP ) technique . All family contact via phone call mail participate study . Children parent examine follow outcomes child approach seven year age . All measure except neurophysiological measure conduct Infant Motor Development Laboratory , School Physical Therapy , National Taiwan University . Several examiner background physical therapy psychology receive training knowledge test instrument test procedure . They reach require level competence agreement 0.80 data compare experienced investigator commence study assessment . All examiner keep blind child 's group assignment . To decrease fatigue child due prolonged examination , participant ask return twice . The first assessment consist IQ test , sustain attention test , executive function test whole session take 180 minute . The second assessment neurophysiological measurement EEG/ERP task session take 90 minute .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Premature Birth</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Seven year old child receive intervention service previous intervention study invite participate study . â€¢ The inclusion criterion term infant : birth weight great 2500 g , gestational age within 3842 week , absence serious prenatal perinatal complication . The inclusion criterion VLBW preterm infant : birth weight less 1500 g , gestational age le 37 week , admission study hospital within 7 day birth , singleton first child twin/multiple birth , absence congenital anomaly severe neonatal disease . Infants exhibit persistently unstable physiological condition 36 week ' post menstrual age ( PMA ) old , discharge hospital 44 week ' PMA older , develop severe neonatal disease ( e.g. , seizure , hydrocephalus , ventriculoperitoneal shunt , periventricular leukomalacia , grade IIIIV intraventricular hemorrhage , necrotizing enterocolitis colostomy , stage IVV retinopathy prematurity ) early terminate study . Additional selection criterion infant study follow : mother read speak Chinese , maternal age old 18 year , absence maternal alcohol drug abuse history , parent marry child 's birth .</criteria>
