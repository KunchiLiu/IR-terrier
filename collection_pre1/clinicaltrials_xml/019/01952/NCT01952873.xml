	<brief_summary>It universally accept high-pressure balloon inflation require effectively deploy coronary balloon-expandable stent . However , consensus guideline regard method balloon inflation , particularly duration inflation . Underexpansion strut malapposition stent deployment among powerful predictor adverse vessel outcome . High-pressure inflation stent deployment effective optimally expand stent , unlike vitro test air , poorly distensible plaque element may instantaneously yield balloon pressure . However , element may ultimately yield prolonged inflation . Most clinical interventional cardiologist inflate relatively short period ( 15-30 sec ) . The investigator note balloon pressure maintain certain pressure level tend decrease time , may require 60-180 second maintain pressure stability . This finding imply plaque element yield slowly time increased pressure , thus increase expansion , suggest prolonged inflation balloon pressure stabilize effective rapid inflation/deflation sequence fully expand appose stent vessel wall . At present consensus stent deployment strategy . It hypothesis prolonged inflation superior commonly use strategy rapid inflation/deflation . Optimal coherence tomography ( OCT ) , novel technology measure near-infrared light reflection translate 2D image , axial resolution nearly 10-times intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) . Thus possible examine extent stent apposition stent expansion use modality . The current randomized trial test hypothesis prolong balloon inflation stable balloon pressure maintain effective rapid inflation/deflation sequence perform balloon inflation pressure .</brief_summary>
