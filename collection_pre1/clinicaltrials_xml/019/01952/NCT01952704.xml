	<brief_summary>Aerobic exercise hold multitude health benefit . Studies mice show aerobic exercise improve memory , increase volume hippocampus , brain 's primary memory center . Only two study conduct human , one healthy elder , schizophrenia population . So far , never aerobic exercise trial traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) look hippocampal volume memory outcomes interest . The propose project randomize control trial aerobic exercise person TBI . We conduct 12-week ( 36 session ) program aerobic exercise ( stationary cycling ) , versus control condition non-aerobic exercise ( stretch ) , memory-impaired TBI patient ) increase hippocampal volume b ) improve memory . Importantly , also expect benefit aerobic exercise level brain function . Specifically , look 'functional connectivity , ' refers efficiently remote region brain 'talk ' . TBI ideal population benefit aerobic exercise , give young age many individual sustain TBI , allow benefit aerobic exercise maximally realize population sufficient neurofunctional reserve . The expected benefit aerobic exercise ( increased hippocampal volume , improved memory ) intervention stand meaningful impact people TBI , include improve health , productivity , independence , quality life . And , unlike current treatment memory impairment ( e.g. , pharmacological agent , cognitive rehabilitation ) , aerobic exercise cost-effective , natural , readily-available treatment memory problem .</brief_summary>
