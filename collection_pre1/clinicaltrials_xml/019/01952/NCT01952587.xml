	<brief_summary>Short title : X-linked biological response HIV sensing : ANRS EP 53 study . Main outcome : To demonstrate HIV-infected woman carry TLR7 c.32A &gt; T SNP high frequency uninfected woman , argue favor role impaired production IFN-alpha pDCs risk become infect HIV-1 . Secondary outcome : To directly demonstrate single cell level TLR7 c.32A &gt; T SNP responsible reduce production IFN-alpha pDCs activation TLR7 HIV-1 RNA . Short abstract ( public dissemination ) : Male female display difference immune system respond pathogen . This could relate hormonal genetic factor locate X chromosome . This project aim characterize X-linked factor influence innate immune response HIV-1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>X-linked Biological Response HIV Sensing : ANRS EP 53 Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasmacytoid dendritic cell ( pDCs ) key actor innate immunity produce high level interferon ( IFN ) -alpha activation Toll-Like Receptors ( TLR ) pathogens . A difference men woman recently show level IFN-alpha produce pDCs TLR activation . The production IFN-alpha response TLR7 activation high presence estrogen . This could responsible gender difference level plasma HIV-1 RNA , low female compare male 50 % , sex-based difference susceptibility HIV infection . Besides role estrogen , X-linked genetic factor could also involve sex-dependent difference TLR7-mediated response pDCs . TLR7 gene locate X chromosome . A single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) TLR7 gene , c.32A &gt; T , associate accelerated disease progression male HIV patient , find represent female HIV well HCV patient , suggest T allele associate gender-dependent increase susceptibility RNA virus infection . A peripheral blood sample collect HIV-infected woman healthy control measure TLR-7 SNP frequency PCR . IFN-alpha production pDCs HIV-1 RNA sense TLR7 also assess .</detailed_description>
