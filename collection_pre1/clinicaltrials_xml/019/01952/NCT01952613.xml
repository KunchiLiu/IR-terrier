	<brief_summary>Our proposal quantitatively analyze gait dynamic hemiplegic individual response Function Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) intervention identifies responder intervention . This study improve knowledge FES intervention help clinician strategize FES intervention effectively base responder ' gait characteristic , thus support NINDS ' fundamental goal translate basic clinical discovery well way prevent treat neurological disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemiplegia associate foot drop occur 50 % stroke survivor frequently impair individual 's ability walk . Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) base neuroprosthetic device develop correct foot drop . The efficacy device initially examine Liberson el al . demonstrated electrical stimulation could assist restore functional movement paralyze limb . In addition assistance foot drop , device show significant improvement biomechanical variable walk speed , distance , stride length physiological cost individual stroke . In order comprehensively understand effect electrical stimulation gait recovery , critical analyze dynamic aspect gait measure gait variability functional electrical stimulation intervention . In proposed investigation , determine 'gait symmetry ' FES assist walk use bilateral cyclograms ankle knee period 6 month . This novel approach account dynamic complexity balance measure deviation joint line symmetry every instance gait cycle provide good measure gait symmetry . Utilization outcome measure allow u understand role electrical stimulation ankle effect get translate knee hip joint walk . The change surface electromyogram ( EMGs ) selective muscle group demonstrate FES contribute muscle re-training stroke . We use advanced signal processing algorithm remove FES artifact EMG signal order comprehensively analyze carry-over effect FES intervention . Finally , employ Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) - advanced data mining technique track quantify overall gait recovery process individual stroke use pattern classification algorithm . The gait symmetry measure EMGs statistically classify see clear separation baseline 6 month interval . This classification allow u identify individual responsive intervention . This information critical allow researcher clinicians re-strategize rehabilitation process . Such scientific evaluation provide base development implementation FES device technology , thus support NINDS ' fundamental goal translate basic clinical discovery well way treat neurological disorder .</detailed_description>
