	<brief_title>Total Ankle Replacement Ankle Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If patient chooses participate , ask sign consent form ask complete follow patient outcome questionnaire : Visual Analog Pain Scale , Short-form 36 , AOFAS hind foot score , Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment questionnaire . The patient undergo surgery later date . Following surgery , patient present routine follow-up appointment . At six month , one year , yearly visit , patient participate study ask complete previously mention outcome questionnaire . These normal follow-up visit time point ; patient ask return clinic additional visit would routine . At visit , patient also receive plain x-ray . Plain x-rays part routine follow-up additional test study . In addition , patient test pre-operatively well one year two year post-operatively order gain well understand effect total ankle replacement low extremity kinematics kinetics . In order understand effect ankle replacement low extremity kinematics kinetics , subject ask complete series functional task . First patient ask complete series clinical test assess patient ability complete different balance task walk trial . Patients first ask stand leg approximately shoulder width apart top one four force plate embed ground lab . Patients ask stand least 10 second . The time able remain balance monitor well movement center pressure ( COP ) beneath patient 's foot . Each patient ask complete 3 stand task force plate . These stand task semi-tandem stance , tandem stance single limb stance . The semi-tandem stance require patient place one foot slightly front , still side side . The tandem stance require patient place one foot front . Each task complete 10 second long possible COP record . The second functional task complete four square step test . This test consist patient step forward , backward , side side order assess movement . This test time start finish see long take patient complete task pre-operatively well post-operatively . Following functional testing , subject series reflective marker attach different anatomical landmark order monitor joint position able calculate joint moment 3 different movement task . Once marker place patient ask walk along 10 meter walkway self select speed monitor use timing system . In addition self-selected speed , patient ask walk standard speed 1.3 m/s . Finally patient ask stand limb squat far possible sit chair . Each task complete approximately seven time low extremity kinematics kinetics record use eight camera motion capture system four force plate embed within 10 meter walkway . The test perform exclusively research purpose administer questionnaire gait analysis study . ( The gait portion study longer conduct . ) . The study proceed minimum 10-year follow-up achieve patient . Questionnaires mail subject appropriate time point unable return Duke .</detailed_description>
