	<brief_title>ExAblate Transcranial MR Guided Focused Ultrasound Treatment Medication Refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety initial effectiveness MRI-guided focus ultrasound thermal ablation designate area brain patient suffer medication-refractory OCD , use ExAblate transcranial system . The ExAblate system medical device involves focus ultrasound system MRI scanner . ExAblate delivers pulse focus ultrasound energy , sonication , target tissue . For OCD Patients : one thermal lesion create one follow target : Anterior cingulate cortex , Anterior Limb internal Capsule , Ventral Striatum Subgenual Cingulate Cortex . The treatment begin series standard diagnostic MR image identify location shape tumor treat . The ExAblate computer use physician 's designation target volume plan best way cover target volume small spot call `` sonications '' . These treatment spot cylinder shape . Their size depend sonication power duration . During treatment , specific MR scan , process identify change tissue temperature , provide thermal map treatment volume confirm therapeutic effect . The thermal map use monitor treatment progress , confirm ablation proceed accord plan , thus close therapy loop . The ExAblate transcranial operate helmet-shaped transducer ( currently utilize 1000-element phased array transducer ) position subject head . The ExAblate transcranial system also include mean immobilize subject head , cool interface water , software CT analysis phase correction computation . After informed consent screening , eligible subject proceed treatment . All subject follow Day 1 , 7 day , 1 month , 6 month 1 , 2 3 year . At follow visit , patient evaluate general health , neurological change ( include MMSE exam ) , efficacy measurement well device/procedure related adverse event may occur follow-up period . Six ( 6 ) month 1 , 2 3 year follow visit also include Full Battery Cognitive/Neurological Testing .</detailed_description>
