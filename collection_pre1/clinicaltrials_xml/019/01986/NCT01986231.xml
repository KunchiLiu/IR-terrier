	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn give multiple dos hormone call glucagon cause major decrease liver glycogen ( animal starch ) . Glucagon currently approve Food Drug Administration give large dose treat severe low blood sugar . Our group study whether glucagon give repeat small dos prevent hypoglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Repeated Doses Glucagon Animal Starch Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoglycemia remain barrier optimal glucose control , necessary prevent diabetes-related complication include eye , kidney , nerve disease . Despite treatment advance insulin pump therapy continuous glucose monitoring , hypoglycemia remains concern , even insulin give closed-loop system . A closed-loop system consist glucose-measuring device , data collect entered algorithm , turn control insulin delivery . The difficulty deliver regular analog insulin manner related slow onset prolong effect deliver subcutaneously . Until rapidly-acting insulin preparation available , discontinuation subcutaneous insulin impend hypoglycemia , algorithm , may insufficient prevent hypoglycemia . Glucagon , hormone secrete alpha cell normal endocrine pancreas , rapidly raise circulate glucose level within minute via glycogenolysis , even give subcu-taneously . Glucagon approve use parenteral injection treatment severe hypoglycemia . Our group successfully complete study human use closed-loop system delivers insulin ( nearly continuous fashion ) prevent treat hyperglycemia well glucagon ( intermittently ) prevent treat hypoglycemia . However , unknown whether repeat dos lead hepatic glycogen depletion , would increase risk severe hypoglycemic episode . 13C MRS ( magnetic resonance spectroscopy ) successfully use quantify hepatic glycogen non-invasive fashion . We propose use 13C MRS compare glycogen store subject type 1 diabetes period without glucagon v period repeat glucagon dosing . The comparison make glycogen store replete ( lunch meal ) glycogen store low ( overnight fast ) . If repeat dos glucagon cause glycogen depletion , would revise dose strategy closed-loop system and/or consider alternative method prevent hypoglycemia .</detailed_description>
