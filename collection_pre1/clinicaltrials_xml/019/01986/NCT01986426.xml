	<brief_title>LTX-315 Patients With Transdermally Accessible Tumours Monotherapy Combination With Ipilimumab Pembrolizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase I , open-label , multi-arm , multicentre , multi-dose dose escalation study patient transdermally accessible tumour ; safety , PK efficacy different dose regimen LTX-315 assess . Patients allocate 4 separate ( parallel ) arm depend tumour type number lesion available . Arm A : Single lesion/sequential lesion treatment arm ( LTX-315 monotherapy ) ( Completed ) Arm B : Concurrent multiple lesion treatment arm tumour type ( LTX-315 monotherapy ) Arm C : LTX-315 combination ipilimumab patient melanoma Arm D : LTX-315 combination pembrolizumab patient TNBC All patient least one lesion available injection . Treatment schedule : Arm A : Injection LTX-315 3 day week 1 , 1 day week 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 . Every 2 week start week 8 . Arm B ( tumour ) : Injection LTX-315 2 day week 3 week ( Day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 ) . Arm C ( melanoma ) : Injection lTX-315 2 day week 3 week ( Day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 ) combination ipilimumab give week 1 every 3 week 4 cycle . Arm D ( TNBC ) : Injection LTX-315 2 day week 3 week ( Day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 ) combination pembrolizumab give week 1 every 3 week 2 year . Patients enrol dose cohort order study entry . Staring low dose . A minimum 3 patient enrolled cohort . Dose escalation determine Safety Review Committee Sponsor . The optimal regimen base result Dose Escalation follow information : 1 . Safety parameter include blood sample cardiovascular effect 2 . Immunohistology ultrasound confirmation necrosis tumour infiltrate lymphocytes 3 . Systemic inflammatory response 4 . Evidence clinical response Cohorts may utilize : 1 . Evaluate different dos LTX-315 2 . Explore potential modification dose schedule 3 . Evaluate potential include appropriate combination therapy LTX-315 4 . Gain information clinical efficacy</detailed_description>
