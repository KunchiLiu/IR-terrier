	<brief_summary>Protein intake stimulates muscle protein synthesis . From standpoint maintain skeletal muscle mass aging , important optimize adaptive response food intake . However , paucity information available describing effect habitual dietary protein intake ( i.e . either high low amount dietary protein consume regular basis ) , subsequent meal-induced stimulation muscle protein synthesis . An adaptation diet several day week may involve splanchnic and/or skeletal muscle adaptation may enhance , decrease , amino acid sensitivity muscle protein synthesis protein ingestion . The aim study investigate effect habitual ( 14 day ) high protein diet compare low protein diet digestion absorption kinetics subsequent muscle protein synthetic response dietary protein ingestion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During adult life skeletal muscle mass remain fairly constant fourth fifth decade . Then , slow process sarcopenia ( age-related loss muscle mass ) believe begin . The maintenance skeletal muscle mass regulate balance oppose process muscle protein synthesis muscle protein breakdown . Food intake , dietary protein particular , stimulate muscle protein synthesis allow net muscle protein accretion throughout day , allow normal maintenance muscle mass healthy individual . Many study describe postprandial muscle protein synthetic response protein intake and/or physical activity , acute finding lead recommendation protein intake athlete wish gain muscle mass well patient elderly individual help maintain muscle mass . However , translate acute finding single meal long-term recommendation perhaps premature , since scientist know little regard previous consume meal affect anabolic responsiveness subsequent food intake . A characteristic adaptation habitual high low protein intake think associated change amplitude diurnal cycle whole body protein . If speculation accurate , implies muscle protein synthetic response feed ( difference fast feed muscle protein synthesis rate ) adapt differ habitual protein intake , may reduce ( enhance ) anabolic responsiveness protein intake . To gain complete scientific understanding , necessary examine whether adaptation fact occur habitual high low amount protein intake regard anabolic response subsequent protein intake . In present investigation , wish investigate impact habitual consumption either high low protein diet 14 day anabolic responsiveness protein meal healthy elderly . Previous work determine whole body adaptation protein intake occur &gt; 10 day . Collectively , finding valuable maximize skeletal muscle adaptive response food intake , ultimately , develop nutritional strategy maintenance enhancement skeletal muscle mass elderly men .</detailed_description>
