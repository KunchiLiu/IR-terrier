	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma ( NB ) originate sympathetic nervous system one common cancer infant child . In hospital , nearly 70 % patient diagnosed stage 4 , metastatic disease poor prognosis , despite use multimodal therapy include chemotherapy , surgery , autologous stem cell transplantation , radiation therapy , differentiation therapy . To improve survival rate patient care , NB Study Group devote research NB-specific molecular imaging , biomarkers , target therapy . We confirm study cancer genetics show N-myc gene ( MYCN ) amplification segmental abnormality overall genomic profiling adverse effect treatment outcome . Therefore , unmet need development novel molecular target therapy NB . Recently , anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) oncogene find play important role pathogenesis NB , well serve driver mutation approximately 10 % high-risk NB . The availability ALK inhibitor also enable ALK treatment target NB . In proposal , plan utilize gene sequencing , array-comparative hybridization , multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method evaluate frequency characteristic ALK mutation amplification patient NB . The gene protein expression ALK also evaluate quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) immunohistochemistry , respectively , compare ALK genotype . The overall genomic pattern , clinical characteristic , histopathology , treatment outcome ALK-mutated NB patient analyze . The result study may serve first report ALK mutation NB Taiwan use development standardize genetic diagnosis protocol , well design future clinical trial target ALK .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study ALK Gene Mutations Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- purpose Despite advance modern multimodal therapy include surgery , chemotherapy , autologous stem cell transplantation , radiation therapy , differentiation therapy , child NB diagnose metastatic disease suffer dismal outcome . There unmet need development novel target therapy NB . Among recently identify target , ALK gene mutation find approximately 10 % high-risk NB patient treatment target several promising agent already test clinical trial , include crizotinib , available Taiwan soon . This study aim evaluate prevalence mutation copy number aberration ALK oncogene prospective previously treat NB patient ' tumor sample ( surgical specimen ) germ-line ( peripheral blood lymphocyte ) . The messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) protein expression level ALK also analyze . The result correlate clinical characteristic pathological finding NB cohort . - technique Prospective case : Cryopreservation tumor sample Retrospective case : Archived tumor Sequencing : point mutation array-based comparative genomic hybridization ( aCGH ) &amp; MLPA（multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification）：analyze copy number alteration ( CNAs ) compare clinical data - expect result The result study may serve first report ALK gene mutation NB Taiwan . We anticipate 5-15 % NB tumor carry common ALK mutation . Genome-wide CNAs profile aCGH help u categorize genomic type NB patient base publish guideline , presence ALK mutation amplification may may associate subtypes bad outcome . Some patient may high ALK expression level without bear common mutation ALK gene locus , may identify novel mutation point patient cohort . Finally , probably find significant prognostic value ALK gene mutation , may independent know risk factor , age , stage , MYCN amplification , genomic pattern . Based result , able develop standardize protocol diagnose ALK mutation Taiwanese NB patient . With development ALK genetic testing , phase II clinical trial ALK inhibitor high-risk NB patient relapse refractory disease may subsequently conduct may improve treatment outcome patient .</detailed_description>
