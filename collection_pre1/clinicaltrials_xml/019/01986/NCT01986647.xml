	<brief_summary>Community-dwelling older adult fear loss independence nursing home placement death . Walking difficulty often lead loss independence . Exercise beneficial physical mental health may prevent walk difficulty promote independence . Recognizing importance exercise , senior housing facility offer exercise program resident . The exercise program often group-based , seated range motion exercise challenge older adult ; consequently participation rate resident satisfaction low . If goal improve walk promote independence exercise program specifically target walk . Therefore , develop challenging , group exercise program entitle `` On Move '' focus fundamental walk . In research study determine On Move program well standard program improve walk promote independence benefit obtain On Move program deliver staff senior living facility instead exercise leader . To answer question , 400 community-dwelling older adult live 32 different Independent Living Facilities Senior High Rises live community attend senior community center randomly assign either 12 week On Move group exercise program standard group exercise program deliver either exercise leader staff activity personnel . Participants ' walking report ability carry everyday activity ( functional ability ) assess 12 week program . We also assess participant safety satisfaction exercise program instructor . The finding research study provide evidence value On Move group exercise program well inform patient choice regard participation exercise program . If successful improve walk promote independence acceptable old adult , On Move program could incorporate exercise program old adult community center , health club , senior residence across country .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-blinded cluster randomize trial compare effectiveness sustainability On Move standard group exercise program 400 community-dwelling old adult . We also examine acceptability risk associate exercise participation . We accomplish objective pursue follow specific aim : 1 . Compare effect On Move group exercise program standard program self-reported function disability walk ability . The On Move program produce great gain self-reported function disability ( Late Life Function Disability Index/LLFDI ) walk ability ( 6-minute walk test/6MWT gait speed ) deliver exercise leader . 2 . When feasible delivered staff activity personnel , explore effectiveness On Move compare standard program ; sustainability compare delivery exercise leader ( feasible ) . Explore barrier identify train staff activity personnel . On Move deliver staff activity personnel ( feasible ) produce gain outcomes great standard program ; comparable deliver exercise leader . 3 . Compare acceptability risk On Move standard exercise program deliver ( ) exercise leader ( b ) staff activity personnel ( feasible ) . On Move result great satisfaction high attendance rate standard program . Attendance rate satisfaction similar exercise leader staff activity personnel lead program feasible recruit staff personnel . Adverse event ( fall , soft tissue injury , muscle soreness , etc ) rate exercise similar two group two facilitator feasible recruit staff personnel . 4 . Explore potential baseline predictor benefit risk participation On Move program facilitate inform patient decision making . We able identify combination baseline physical , psychosocial demographic factor associate treatment response adverse event outcomes . This single-blinded cluster randomize trial target community-dwelling old adult reside Independent Living Facilities Senior High Rises live community attend senior community center . The trial compare type exercise program ( 12 week standard group exercise program 12 week On Move group exercise program ) mode delivery ( exercise leader staff activity personnel ) . Primary outcome include function , disability walk ability . We also examine acceptability risk associate exercise participation . Study population We recruit participant Independent Living Facilities ( ILFs ) , Senior Housing sit senior community center . Interventions : Exercise program comparison . The On Move exercise program compare standard group exercise program . Both exercise program group-based led person . Both program deliver trained exercise leader train staff activity personnel ( person available ) . When suitable staff activity person available , program deliver one exercise leader . The frequency duration program identical ( 50 minute , 2 time week 12 week ) . The main difference standard On Move group exercise program program content describe . The On Move exercise program base principle motor learn enhance `` skill '' smooth automatic movement control . The program contain warm-up ( 5 minute ) , step pattern ( 15 minute ) , walk pattern ( 15 minute ) , strengthen exercise ( 10 minute ) , cool-down exercise ( 5 minute ) . The warm-up cool contain gentle range motion exercise stretch low extremity trunk . The step walking pattern goal-oriented progressively difficult pattern promote time coordination stepping , integrate phase gait cycle . The strengthening exercise conduct sit stand target low extremity muscle . The majority program conduct standing ( 40 minute ) small portion conduct sit ( 10 minute ) . The standard group exercise program base exercise program currently conduct facility ( i.e . standard care ) . The operationally define program contain warm-up ( 5 minute ) , upper low extremity strength flexibility exercise ( 30 minute ) , static balance exercise ( 10 minute ) cool-down ( 5 minute ) . The majority program conduct sit ( 40 minute ) small portion ( 10 minute ) conduct stand . Sustainability program : exercise leader staff activity personnel comparison ( Aim 2 ) . The sustainability program evaluate assess effectiveness On Move compare standard program deliver staff activity personnel compare outcome obtain On Move program deliver exercise leader staff activity personnel . Outcomes : Our main outcome , function , disability , walk ability highly associate independence extremely important old adult . Our primary measure function disability Late Life Function Disability Instrument ( LLFDI ) main measure walk ability Six Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) gait speed . We also examine confidence walking ( Gait Efficacy Scale ) , walk challenge condition ( challenge gait task figure 8 walk ) , gait variability additional measure walk ability . All measure collect baseline immediately follow 12 week intervention research personnel blind intervention group assignment . All test conduct ILFs Senior Housing site . Data analysis : Aim 1 : First , perform multivariate Hotelling t-test simultaneously compare baseline follow-up change three primary outcome arm protect type I error rate multiplicity . If significant , subsequent analysis perform without multiplicity adjustment . If , subsequent comparison perform conservative Bonferroni correction α=0.05/4=0.0125 level . This protected test approach recommend statistical literature use exercise intervention trial multiple outcome . Second , fit series linear mixed model use SAS® MIXED procedure baseline follow-up change continuous outcome ( LLFDI function/disability , walk ability , measure mobility performance ) dependent variable ; intervention arm ( standard/On Move ) , fixed effect primary interest ; baseline value outcome additional fixed effect covariate ; facility random effect account great similarity participant facility compare different facility result non-independence observation within facility ( ie . cluster ) . We construct appropriate mean contrast estimate difference gain two intervention deliver exercise leader ( Aim 1 ) whose statistical significance estimate serve formal test hypothesis . We consider add baseline measure find significantly different arm deem important additional fix effect covariates model ass robustness finding . We note wait participant randomized staff activity personnel class constitute group control participant , small , without intervention . Therefore , perform another sensitivity analysis employ similar analytic strategy three intervention arm ( On Move/Standard/Wait List Control ) . Aim 3 ( ) : We fit series generalize estimating equation ( GEE ) model ( 68 ) use SAS® GENMOD procedure dichotomous adverse event , adherence ( 21+ session ≥90 % ) satisfaction outcome dependent variable ; binomial distribution outcome logit canonical link function ; intervention arm , effect primary interest ; baseline value outcome measure find different arm deem important additional fix effect covariates ; exchangeable work correlation structure account cluster due facility . We appropriately construct contrast test hypotheses differential proportion adverse event base intervention deliver exercise leader . Aims 2 , 3 ( b ) 4 Exploratory Analyses Aim 2 : We propose analytic strategy exploratory philosophy Aim 2 sustainability aim , uncertainty surround ability recruit train staff activity person lead class safely per protocol . We fit series linear mixed model use SAS® MIXED procedure baseline follow-up change continuous outcome ( LLFDI function/disability , walk ability , measure mobility performance ) dependent variable ; intervention arm ( standard/On Move ) , delivery mode ( exercise leader/staff activity personnel ) interaction fix effect interest ; baseline value outcome measure find different arm deem important additional fix effect covariates ; facility random effect account great similarity participant facility compare different facility result non-independence observation within facility ( ie . cluster ) . We construct appropriate mean contrast estimate difference gain two intervention deliver staff exercise personnel ( Aim 2 effectiveness hypothesis ) ; difference gain attributable On Move intervention deliver exercise leader staff activity personnel ( Aim 2 sustainability hypothesis ) . Statistical significance estimate serve formal test hypothesis . We note participant randomized staff activity personnel wait 12 week since baseline assessment randomization start intervention , may change ; underwent second baseline assessment immediately prior start exercise intervention . Therefore , repeat analysis use second baseline assessment instead first one ass sensitivity result . Aim 3 ( b ) : We fit series generalize estimating equation ( GEE ) model use SAS® GENMOD procedure dichotomous adverse event , adherence ( 21+ session ≥90 % ) satisfaction outcome dependent variable ; binomial distribution outcome logit canonical link function ; intervention arm , delivery model interaction effect interest ; baseline value outcome measure find different arm deem important additional fix effect covariates ; exchangeable work correlation structure account cluster due facility . We appropriately construct contrast test hypotheses differential proportion adverse event base intervention delivered staff activity personnel delivery mode . Aim 4 : We perform exploratory analysis identify combination baseline predictor treatment response risk participate On Move program .</detailed_description>
