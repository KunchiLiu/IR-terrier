	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm highgrade metastatic sarcoma stable 612 cycle one chemotherapeutic regimen ( cytotoxic biologic ) although change chemotherapy allow result toxicity/tolerability rather progression . A patient must evidence progression time chemotherapy order eligible trial . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm CT scan , PET CT , MRI exam . At least 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥60 % ) Normal bone marrow organ function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN 3x IULN normal ALT AST patient Gilbert 's disease AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine less institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 INR &lt; 1.5 patient Coumadin time ablation No 10 treatable lesion evaluate experienced interventional oncologic radiologist eligibility lesion accessibility ablation 10 lesion become technically infeasible . These lesion must treat two threeweek time period initial interventional radiology evaluation . Lung liver lesion range 1 cm 7 cm single lesion great 5 cm multiple lesion . There size criterion osseous lesion . The lesion amenable safe , ultrasound/computed tomographic/fluoroscopic guide percutaneous approach . The targeted metastasis must sufficiently separable central nervous system , major peripheral motor nerve , bowel , bladder . All lesion must amenable treatment . If patient receive radiation therapy , must onemonth washout period . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration ablation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Patient ( legally authorize representative applicable ) must able understand willing sign IRB approve write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria History malignancy ≤ 5 year previous exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection , carcinoma situ cervix , localized prostate cancer . Receiving investigational agent simultaneously within 3 week follow ablation procedure . Known brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis must exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Patients whose treatment plan include continue chemotherapy ablation per treat physician , ablation therapy mean serve maintenance therapy lieu chemotherapy .</criteria>
