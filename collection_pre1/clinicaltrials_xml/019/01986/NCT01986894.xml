	<brief_summary>This single-center , randomize , double-blind crossover study four treatment , four period four sequence investigate effect orally administer pomalidomide QT interval . The study conduct healthy male subject . Pomalidomide ( clinically indicate dose multiple myeloma [ MM ] per United States Package Insert [ USPI ] 4 mg supratherapeutic dose 20 mg ) placebo treatment double-blinded . Moxifloxacin ( positive control ) administer open-label fashion determine sensitivity assay . The core electrocardiogram ( ECG ) laboratory ECG reader blind study treatment sequence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 QT Study Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 72 male subject randomize enrol , 18 subject assign treatment sequence . For treatment sequence , subject participate screening phase , four baseline phase , four treatment period follow visit . Within 28 day prior Period 1 dosing , subject sign informed consent document ( ICD ) undergo screen procedure confirm eligibility . Qualifying subject return clinical site Day -2 Period 1 begin baseline assessment , domicile clinical site Day -2 Day 2 Period 1 . For remain study period , subject return clinical site Day -1 begin baseline assessment , domicile clinical site Day -1 Day 2 . Subjects assign randomly one four treatment sequence receive single dose assign treatment Day 1 study period . There minimum 7 day 14 day dose . Subjects begin overnight fast least 8 hour prior start continuous Holter monitoring Day 1 ( Day 1 Period 1 ) . On morning Day 1 ( Day -1 Period 1 ) , continuous Holter monitoring approximately 24 hour perform . Triplicate ECGs extract analysis specific predose postdose timepoints ( equivalent time Day -1 Period 1 ) . Blood sample collect pre specify timepoints pharmacokinetic ( PK ) clinical laboratory assessment . Safety monitor throughout study . During study period , subject discharge clinical site Day 2 upon satisfactory safety review completion require study procedure . A safety follow conduct telephone 5 7 day follow discharge Period 4 . In event subject discontinues study , early termination visit perform .</detailed_description>
