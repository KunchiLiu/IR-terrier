	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether 40 hyperbaric oxygen session effect long-term symptom concussion . This study enroll 90 individual persistent problem 1-5 year mild traumatic brain injury . These individual randomize receive either oxygen air pressurize hyperbaric chamber . Participants receive 40 daily hyperbaric chamber session . Participants series test questionnaires begin chamber session , complete 40 session , 12 month join study . These test include computer-based pencil-and-paper questionnaire think test , brain imaging , neurological examination , eye exam . Participants also ask provide blood future research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single center , randomize , double-blind study explore whether course hyperbaric oxygen ameliorate persistent post-concussive symptom mild traumatic brain injury . In study , civilian adult men woman persistent symptom 1 5 year injury randomize receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen session ( 100 % oxygen 1.5 atmosphere absolute 60 minute ) sham chamber session ( room air 1.2 atmosphere absolute room air sea level pressure , 60 minute ) . Chamber session provide Monday Friday , exclude holiday , participant 12 week complete 40 session . Participants evaluate chamber session , 13 week , 12 month . Assessments include self-administered questionnaire , neuropsychological function , neuroimaging , brief neurological examination , neuro-optometry evaluation . These outcome tool measure symptoms deficit time enrollment subsequent evaluation , provide insight whether hyperbaric oxygen play role recovery mild traumatic brain in-jury . Participants ask provide blood long-term storage serum , plasma , DNA future investigation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults , age 1860 , men woman Able speak read English primary language Able willing provide write informed consent study participation . Able willing complete outcome assessment provide blood urine sample require study protocol . Able tolerate chamber environment hood placement equalize middle ear pressure . Past history least one mild traumatic brain injury persistent symptom meet follow criterion : 1 ) Brain injury occur least 1 year 5 year prior enrollment ; 2 ) Brain injury occur adult ( least 18 year age ) ; , 3 ) Brain injury occur due nonpenetrating trauma grade mild . At least 3 follow persistent postconcussive symptom injury : headache , dizziness balance problem , blur vision , tiredness/fatigue sleep problem , seizure , remember thing solve problem , manage stress emotional upset , control temper/irritability , ring ear . Diabetes mellitus . Uncontrolled seizure disorder ( participant must therapy seizurefree least 6 month ) . Claustrophobia preclude chamber hood tolerance . Implanted device clear hyperbaric pressurization . Pregnancy plan become pregnant study participation period . Women childbearing potential ask use acceptable form birth control 13week assessment visit . Lung disease , emphysema , chronic bronchitis , asthma wellcontrolled , bullous lung disease , raise risk pulmonary barotrauma due air trap . Active malignancy , previous malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma ) last 5 year , prior treatment bleomycin ( Blenoxane ) . Prior treatment doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) acceptable long followup echocardiography normal . Chronic disease heart renal failure would raise participant 's risk adverse event hyperbaric oxygenation . Prior military service theater . Alcohol abuse , selfreport , within last year . Lifetime history illicit drug use , selfreport , except remote ( great one year ) , nonhabitual use marijuana . Failed urine drug screen study participation . Continued participation intervention period sport activity head injury likely , contact football , boxing , mixed martial art , etc . Blind deaf . Major psychiatric disorder degenerative mental disease ( multiple sclerosis ) . Prior therapeutic radiation central nervous system . Prior traumatic brain injury meeting severe moderate classification , anoxic injury stroke . Known untreated chronic acute medical condition , hypothyroidism , Cushing 's disease , untreated hypertension , etc. , would confound outcome assessment inhibit compliance study protocol . If treat , disorder would exclude . Prior hyperbaric oxygen brain injury . Prior hyperbaric oxygen reason within last 3 month .</criteria>
