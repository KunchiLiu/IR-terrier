	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate combination two drug call GSK1120212 ( trametinib ) GSK2141795 possible treatment recurrent persistent cervical cancer . Trametinib GSK2141795 drug may stop cancer cell grow . Trametinib MEK inhibitor - block protein call MEK commonly overactive tumor cell . GSK2141795 AKT inhibitor block pathway cancer cell commonly overactive tumor cell call PI3kinase pathway . In research study , investigator look see whether combination Trametinib GSK2141795 useful treat recurrent persistent cervical cancer . Additionally , investigator look see participant whose tumor contain particular genetic make-up well response combination trametinib GSK2141795 . Participants ' tumor test mutation gene could make cancer susceptible trametinib GSK2141795 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : The participant ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question participant 's health , current medication , allergy . - Physical exam , include height weight - An eye exam , eye specialist - Performance status , investigator ask participant question able carry usual activity . - Vital sign , include blood pressure , pulse , body temperature respiratory rate - An assessment participant 's tumor CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) , chest , stomach area , pelvis . - Blood test ( approximately 2-3 tablespoon ) include hematology , chemistry , liver function , kidney function , blood sugar level , blood clotting level - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , test check participant 's heart 's rhythm - Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , test check participant 's heart 's structure function . - Serum pregnancy test participant capable become pregnant If result test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study treatment . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study treatment . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . Additional research procedure perform time screening : - Archival tumor testing : During study , additional test perform sample participant 's original tumor store institution 's tissue bank . These test perform tumor tissue sample previous biopsy surgeries participant 's cancer . The research do sample involve look DNA proteins participant 's cancer see researcher learn participant 's type cancer understand trametinib GSK2141795 might work tumor . Testing sample require participant undergo additional procedure . TISSUE COLLECTIONS/OWNERSHIP : Participation protocol involve provide specimen ( ) participant 's tissue . Please know investigator leave institution , research tissue might remain DF/HCC might transfer another institution . - Additional Blood test : Approximately 2 tablespoon blood collect research test . This test involve look DNA proteins participant 's blood compare see cancer . This drawn participant begin take study drug . These research sample collection require part research study . If participant wish undergo procedure , participant may participate research study . - Optional pre post tumor biopsy : Before participant begin receive study drug , doctor arrange procedure tumor biopsied . Your entire tumor part tumor might remove ( excisional biopsy ) small sample tumor might remove use needle ( needle biopsy , fine needle aspirate ) guidance radiographic study . This also occur participant begin treatment 2-4 week treatment start . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : Study Drugs : If participant decides take part research study , participant give study drug diary treatment cycle . The participant ask complete drug diary record take dose give reason participant take study drug . At end cycle , participant return pill bottle remain pill prior start next cycle . The participant receive new set pill new diary participant continue next cycle . Clinical Exams : During cycle participant physical exam , ask question general health specific question problem might medication participant may take . The participant expect follow participant study . At begin cycle ( one cycle equal 28 day ) : - Recording health problem , include side effect study drug - List medication take since last visit - Physical examination ( include measurement vital sign , blood pressure , breathe rate , heart rate , temperature weight ) - Evaluation participant 's performance status ( ability carry daily activity ) - Blood sample ( approximately 2-3 tablespoon blood take ) evaluate participant 's blood count , electrolyte , liver function , kidney function blood sugar level . - EKG , test check participant 's heart 's rhythm . This performed start cycle . Once week first cycle : - The participant call member study team record health problem , include side effect study drug change medication . - Blood sample ( approximately 1 teaspoon blood take ) evaluate blood sugar level . This do lab close home . If participant 's doctor think blood sugar need monitoring , participant may continue blood sample draw check blood sugar weekly daily past first cycle . Every 2 cycle : - Blood sample ( approximately 1 teaspoon blood take ) evaluate participant 's HgbA1C , test evaluates blood sugar level period time . This do lab close home . - CT scan MRI chest , stomach area , pelvis see participant 's cancer increasing , decreasing , stay size . If cancer decreasing , participant 's doctor may schedule participant another CT scan one month check . - ECHO , test check participant 's heart 's structure function At end study : - Recording health problem , include side effect study drug . - List medication take since last visit - Physical examination ( include measurement participant 's vital sign , blood pressure , breathe rate , heart rate , temperature , weight . ) - Evaluation participant 's performance status ( ability carry daily activity ) . - Blood sample ( approximately 2-3 tablespoon blood take ) evaluate participant 's blood count , electrolyte , liver function , kidney function , blood sugar level , HgbA1C . After final dose study drug : The investigator would like keep track participant 's medical condition 3 year participant completes study . The investigator would like call participant telephone see participant clinic evaluation status , disease current therapy . Keeping touch participant check condition routinely help u look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
