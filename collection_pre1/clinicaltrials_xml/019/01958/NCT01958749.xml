	<brief_summary>The current standard treatment chronic tympanic membrane perforation ( TMP ) involve fat graft patient insert ear , perforation , promote heal use fat graft myringoplasty ( FGM ) technique . Platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) also use promote TMP heal involves patient provide blood sample , process produce PRP apply perforation . This prospective , multi-centre study evaluate whether combine technique improve rate closure patient chronic TMP involve &lt; 50 % membrane . Patients randomize receive either standard FGM treatment FGM treatment addition PRP . At 3 month postintervention blind observer rate degree TMP closure .

	<brief_title>Fat Graft Myringoplasty With Without Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) Treating Smaller Tympanic Membrane Perforations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , single-blinded , randomise control trial . Patients randomise site undergo FGM without PRP . Step 1 group . Under LA ( GA patient unable tolerate ) , fat graft take behind mastoid process , posteriorly beneath hairline necessary . The graft keep moist 0.9 % saline.The ear canal inject LA edge perforation freshen . Gelfoam place middle ear fat graft place top touch underside TM slightly bulge . In attempt achieve standardisation surgical technique site , surgeon provide operative video watch beforehand . Step 2 . The surgeon inform randomisation outcome Group 1 2 . Group 1 ( Non PRP ) : patient FGM alone , simply covered piece saline-soaked Gelfoam cut completely cover perforation graft . Group 2 ( PRP ) : Group 1 , Gelfoam instead soak PRP derive patient 's whole blood . The generation PRP descibed : - - 10-20 mL autologous blood collect antecubital vein place adenosine citrate dextrose-acid ( ACD-A ) collection tube prevent premature activation - Blood immediately place centrifuge 1100g 10 minute ( ) - Supernatant remove collected syringe - Injected onto surface fat graft - Rest add piece gelfoam - Place gelfoam + PRP TM perforation Post op care : patient ask keep ear dry , cover cotton ball take shower bath first week , otherwise leave open . They give eye dropper , instruct use 2 drop white vinegar ear three time day 10 day , head tilt allow vinegar reach fat graft . Vinegar drop effective treatment Pseudomonas infection , common infection external ear canal , commonly use external ear infection . If cause discomfort , patient instruct stop , information record first follow . If infect discharge , patient instruct contact surgeon , treat ciprofloxacin-containing eardrop one week . The occurrence event record , censor event purpose study . Follow schedule : Patients follow 2 week , 6 week 3 month post surgery . A planned interim analysis perform half-way point study ; centre compare heterogeneity sit use ANOVA , group 1 group 2 . Data sit heterogeneous data may discard , and/or site recruit , and/or exist site enrollment increase need allow adequate patient recruitment . Our primary outcome measure test unpaired t-test two group . The investigator also perform secondary analysis degree closure non-complete closure population two treatment arm use Wilcoxon non-parametric test Power analysis : investigator deem 30 % difference closure rate two group clinically significant . The investigator estimate closure rate fat alone 50 % , base previous publication . To show difference closure rate 70 % blood treat group , power 0.8 alpha error 0.05 would require 45 subject group . This binary outcome pas fail . The investigator anticipate drop , failure follow , order 30 % 3 month , aim recruit 46 subject arm .</detailed_description>
