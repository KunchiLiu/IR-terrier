	<brief_summary>1 : SPECIFIC AIM I : To compare treatment option neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) due in-utero narcotic exposure . One hundred eighty four full-term infant diagnosis NAS require medication study . Infants randomize receive either morphine methadone . It hypothesize morphine treat infant well require few day hospital compare methadone treated infant . 2 . SPECIFIC AIM II : To evaluate effect NAS treatment long-term neurodevelopmental outcome . Infants evaluate development test 18 month age . It hypothesize morphine treat infant well neurodevelopmental outcome . It also hypothesize neurobehavioral abnormality identify two week age correlate neurodevelopmental impairment 18 month . 3 : SPECIFIC AIM III : To determine common genetic variation gene involve narcotic action contribute severity NAS . A DNA sample obtain infant analyzed difference 3 key gene . This correlated short-term long-term outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 : SPECIFIC AIM I : To compare short term efficacy morphine methadone treatment NAS . One hundred eighty four term infant diagnosis NAS require pharmacotherapy study . Infants born mother receive adequate prenatal care maintain opioid agonist medication pregnancy eligible . Infants randomize receive either neonatal morphine solution methadone double blind , double dummy design . It hypothesize morphine treat infant require significantly few day hospital compare methadone treated infant . While primary outcome total length initial hospital stay ( LOS ) , total LOS related NAS , total duration medical treatment NAS , need second drug control symptom , infant growth also evaluate important secondary outcome medication group assignment . 2 . SPECIFIC AIM II : To evaluate effect NAS treatment long-term neurodevelopmental outcome . Infants treatment group evaluate 18 month age use Bayley III Scales Infant Development . It hypothesize morphine treat infant well neurodevelopmental outcomes 18 month compare methadone treated infant . It also hypothesize neurobehavioral abnormality ( either treatment group ) identify two week age use NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale ( NNNS ) correlate neurodevelopmental impairment detect Bayley III . Early identification infant high risk impair development facilitate therapeutic intervention improve outcome decrease resource utilization . 3 : SPECIFIC AIM III : To determine single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) gene control opioid pharmacodynamics contribute severity NAS . SNP genotyping cord blood buccal swab obtain infant correlate short term outcome ( Aim 1 ) neurodevelopment assessment ( Aim 2 ) confirm genetic variation play major role severity outcome infant NAS .</detailed_description>
