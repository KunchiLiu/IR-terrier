	<brief_summary>The primary purpose research investigate anti-tumor immune response patient undergo chemotherapy radiation Head Neck Cancers . Hypothesis : Treatment HPV-associated OPSCC concurrent chemoradiation result change tumor microenvironment . We hypothesize change daily fractionate chemoradiotherapy lead detectable change HPV-specific tumor immune response . Hypothesis : HPV-specific cellular immune response still detect radiotherapy presence absence lymphopenia . - This study determine whether specific anti-tumor immune response ( Specific Antibodies Specific T-cells ) detect patient undergoing chemoradiation treatment Head Neck Cancers . - This study evaluate presence absence HPV ( human papillomavirus ) specific immune response , , treatment Head Neck Cancers . - This study also evaluate whether decreased white blood cell count may affect development immune response Head Neck cancer patient undergoing treatment . Any head neck cancer patient undergo concurrent chemoradiotherapy eligible : old 18 year age , capable providing informed consent , life expectancy great 4 month , good performance status . You eligible irregardless HPV positive negative status . People HPV positive ( human papillomavirus associate ) head neck cancer may join . People HPV negative head neck cancer may also join .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As pilot study seek describe potential impact chemoradiotherapy natural history immunologic response HPV-associated OPSCC , time venipuncture reflect goal sample throughout course CTRT ( chemoradiation therapy ) permit variability base number radiation fraction deliver . It also reflect consideration time point lend venipuncture tumour biopsy base toxicity response profile chemoradiation HPV-associated OPSCC patient . As , 10 subject HPV-associated OPSCC 10 subject non-HPV associate HNSCC see respective discipline otolaryngology-head neck surgery , radiation oncology , medical oncology clinically indicate enrolled clinical protocol . Importantly , clinical therapeutic recommendation , radiation treatment plan , therapeutic drug alter enrollment protocol . Tumors directly visible office laryngopharyngoscopy easily accessible ( i.e . oropharyngeal tonsil ) directly biopsied ( non-percutaneously ) analyze detailed .</detailed_description>
