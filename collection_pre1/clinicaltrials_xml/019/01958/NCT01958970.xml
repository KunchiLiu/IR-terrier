	<brief_title>Effects PINTA 745 End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) Patients Who Require Hemodialysis Have Protein Energy Wasting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( participant assign chance study treatment ) , double-blind ( participant study personnel know identity study treatment ) , placebo ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) -controlled study patient receive maintenance hemodialysis . Three participant receive PINTA 745 every participant receive placebo . PINTA 745 placebo take intravenously per week follow dialysis . The study period consist screening , treatment 12 week , follow 8 week . Evaluations perform assess safety , pharmacokinetics ( study body drug ) , pharmacodynamics ( study drug body ) effectiveness treat protein energy wasting ( increase muscle size muscle function ) throughout study .</detailed_description>
