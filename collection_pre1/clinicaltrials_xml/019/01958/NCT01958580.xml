Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride docetaxel , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride , Docetaxel , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Uterine Sarcoma That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity tolerability adjuvant pelvic radiation combination gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) /docetaxel chemotherapy patient stage 1 2 surgically-resected uterine leiomyosarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess two year recurrence-free survival patient uterine leiomyosarcoma treat chemotherapy radiation therapy include define pattern recurrence patient uterine leiomyosarcoma treated regimen . OUTLINE : CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 8 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . RADIATION THERAPY : Beginning week 10 , patient undergo 3 fraction brachytherapy intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 3 week . Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 5 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
