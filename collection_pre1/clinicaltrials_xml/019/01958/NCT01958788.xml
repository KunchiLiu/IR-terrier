	<detailed_description>Generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) characterize excessive uncontrollable worry anxiety . This common debilitate anxiety disorder associate significant distress well substantial impairment occupational , social , daily functioning . As result , effective treatment GAD essential . Several cognitive-behavioural treatment ( CBT ) protocols developed GAD , include efficacious treatment develop research group . This CBT protocol GAD centre upon intolerance uncertainty , dispositional characteristic arises set negative belief uncertainty consequence ( Dugas &amp; Robichaud , 2007 ) . Previous research show individual GAD demonstrate high intolerance uncertainty , number potential pathway intolerance uncertainty may lead symptom GAD ( see Dugas &amp; Robichaud , 2007 review ) . Our CBT protocol target intolerance uncertainty demonstrate good efficacy across four publish randomized clinical trial : approximately 70 % participant fully remit GAD follow treatment maintain gain extend follow-up period . These result , positive , suggest substantial minority individual fully benefit exist treatment protocol . Across randomized clinical trial , individual achieve diagnostic remission GAD continue endorse elevate level intolerance uncertainty . This suggest current CBT protocol effectively reduce intolerance uncertainty treat individual . Additionally , exist treatment protocol 6 major component , utilizes number cognitive behavioural technique ( include symptom monitoring , motivational interviewing , situational exposure , problem-solving training , imaginal exposure ) , require least 14 session implement . Recent literature ( e.g. , Cougle et al. , 2011 ) suggest increased need parsimony efficiency CBT protocols . As result , research group investigate new method target intolerance uncertainty demonstrate great parsimony efficiency . Our previous CBT protocol GAD target intolerance uncertainty directly situational exposure , indirectly motivational interviewing , problem-solving training , imaginal exposure . In effort streamline strengthen GAD treatment , newly develop CBT protocol target intolerance uncertainty directly . In new CBT protocol , intolerance uncertainty target use behavioural experiment participant identify tested belief uncertainty . The extant literature suggest behavioural experiment efficacious way target emotional , cognitive , behavioural component anxiety disorder may superior habituation-based exposure paradigm ( McMillan &amp; Lee , 2010 ; Salkovskis et al. , 2007 ) . The current study examine newly develop CBT protocol few component could deliver comparable GAD symptom reduction . Seven ( 7 ) individual primary diagnosis GAD complete 12 session CBT use newly develop treatment protocol focus exclusively intolerance uncertainty . The treatment consist 50-minute , weekly session target intolerance uncertainty primarily via behavioural experiment . The three treatment component include : ( 1 ) psychoeducation uncertainty awareness training ; ( 2 ) test beliefs uncertainty ( via behavioural experiment ) ; ( 3 ) relapse prevention . Measures GAD symptom , general psychopathology , intolerance uncertainty administer pre- , mid- , post-treatment , well 3- 6-month follow-up . Our main outcomes interest effect size ( i.e. , relative magnitude change pre-posttreatment , pretreatment 6-month follow-up , posttreatment 6-month follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
