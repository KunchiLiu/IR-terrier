	<brief_summary>- Vascular inflammation key factor pathogenesis outcome atherosclerosis . 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) promise tool identify quantify vascular inflammation within atherosclerotic plaque . - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) closely associate many cardiometabolic risk factor . NAFLD detect measure liver fat accumulation use compute tomography ( CT ) . - Also epicardial adipose tissue ( EAT ) volume determine computed tomography ( CT ) independent marker cardiovascular event general population . - Therefore , purpose investigator study compare NAFLD severity EAT volume FDG uptake measure PET/CT .</brief_summary>
