	<brief_summary>The investigator objective run human clinical trial brain activity record `` brain-chip '' implant human brain use provide novel communication capability severely paralyzed individual allow direct brain-control computer interface . A prospective , longitudinal , single-arm early feasibility study use examine safety effectiveness use neural communication system control simple computer interface tablet computer . Initial brain control train occur simplify computer environment , however , ultimate objective clinical trial allow human patient autonomous control Google Android tablet operate system . Tablet computer offer balance ease use functionality facilitate fusion BMI . The tablet interface could potentially allow patient population make phone call , manage personal finance , watch movie , paint picture , play videogames , program application , interact variety `` smart '' device television , kitchen appliance , perhaps time , device robotic limb smart car . Brain control tablet computer potential greatly improve quality life severely paralyzed individual . Two subject enrol , implanted NCS period 53 week . The study expect take two year total .</brief_summary>
