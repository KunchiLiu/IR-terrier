	<criteria>Subject must &gt; 21 year age . Subject ability understand cooperate study procedure agree return require followup visit , test , exam . International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) must ≤ 1.5 time procedure ( subject take warfarin may include dose taper prior procedure meet inclusion criterion . Dose may return therapeutic level procedure ) . The subject must sign write informed consent prior procedure , use form approve local medical Ethics Committee ( EC ) . The life expectancy subject least one year . The subject lesion locate internal carotid artery ( ICA ) ; carotid bifurcation may involve . The subject must minimum distance 5 cm clavicle bifurcation , assess duplex Doppler ultrasound , compute axial tomographic ( CT ) angiography magnetic resonance ( MR ) angiography . The subject participate another investigational study would interfere conduct result study . The subject dementia neurological illness may confound neurological evaluation . Presence one follow anatomic risk factor : Previous radiation treatment neck radical neck dissection Tracheostomy tracheal stoma Laryngectomy Contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy Severe tandem lesion Inability extend head due cervical arthritis cervical disorder Total occlusion target vessel . There exist , previously place stent target artery . The subject know lifethreatening allergy contrast medium treat . Subject history intolerance allergic reaction study medication include aspirin , clopidogrel bisulfate ( Plavix® ) ticlopidine ( Ticlid® ) , prasugrel heparin bivalirudin ( Angiomax™ ) . Subjects must able tolerate combination aspirin clopidogrel/ticlopidine prasugrel . The subject gastrointestinal bleed would interfere antiplatelet therapy . The subject know cardiac source emboli . Subject Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) less 8 gm/dL ( unless dialysis ) , platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 , know heparin associate thrombocytopenia . Subject document atrial fibrillation prior 90 day . The subject history bleed diathesis coagulopathy include thrombocytopenia inability receive heparin amount sufficient maintain activate clotting time ( ACT ) &gt; 250 , subject refuse blood transfusion . The subject atherosclerotic disease involve ipsilateral common carotid artery ( CCA ) preclude safe placement sheath . The subject abnormal angiographic finding target lesion indicate subject risk stroke , : ipsilateral arterial stenosis great severity target lesion , cerebral aneurysm , arteriovenous malformation cerebral vasculature . There evidence carotid artery dissection prior initiation procedure . There angiographically visible thrombus . There condition precludes proper angiographic assessment make percutaneous arterial access unsafe , e.g . morbid obesity , sustain systolic blood pressure &gt; 180 mm Hg , tortuosity , occlusive disease , vessel anatomy aortic arch anatomy . Occlusion ( TIMI 0 flow ) , string sign ipsilateral common internal carotid artery . There evidence bilateral carotid stenosis would require intervention within 30 day procedure . There evidence major stroke ( NIHSS ≥10 ) within previous 30 day procedure patient consider , investigator , high risk hemorrhagic stroke . There plan treatment nontarget lesion within 30 day post procedure . There history intracranial hemorrhage within previous 3 month , include hemorrhagic transformation ischemic stroke . There history ipsilateral stroke fluctuate neurologic symptom within one year prior procedure . Female subject pregnant ( negative pregnancy test require woman childbearing potential ) . Subjects , Investigator determine , risk Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT )</criteria>
