	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis define genetic disorder affect approximately 100,000 individual worldwide . CF cause mutation CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) gene . CF patient highly prone environmental opportunistic bacterial infection lead prolonged chronic lung infection . This result reduction life expectancy CF patient due excessive lung tissue destruction . Nitric Oxide ( NO ) naturally produce antimicrobial agent part innate immune defense system lung . Both vitro vivo study show clearly NO act wide variety microbe include drug resistant bacteria well viruses fungi . Building successful phase I safety trial , team aim develop combine drug-device strategy combat lung infection cause biofilm-forming bacteria . Unlike inhaled drug , NO also smooth muscle relaxant avoids concomitant bronchial constriction often associate inhaled antibiotic . An added benefit NO therapy mucolytic activity . We suggest combine broad spectrum antimicrobial activity , signal mucolytic property NO , deliver lung CF patient , direct reduce bacterial resistance , microbial burden biofilms well result improve airway clearance viscid sputum . Primary Objectives : Assess safety tolerability NO intermittent inhalation treatment ≥10 year old CF subject . Secondary Objective : Assess improvement force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) NO intermittent inhalation . Up 10 subject Cystic Fibrosis enrol study . Treatment administration : The subject receive intermittent inhalation NO addition standard treatment 10 working day ( NO treatment give subject weekend day ) . The subject ask attend CF clinic week period two week order evaluate parameter relate study . Oxygen ( O2 ) , NO , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) deliver patient continuously monitor .</brief_summary>
