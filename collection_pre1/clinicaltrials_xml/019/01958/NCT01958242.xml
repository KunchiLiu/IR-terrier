	<brief_summary>Blood transfusion pediatric heart surgery relatively common practice occur 46 % patient , however use associate increased morbidity . In pediatric population undergo heart surgery transfusion homologous blood usually require due mismatch priming volume cardiopulmonary bypass circuit patient blood volume . Several strategy propose order minimize use blood product . The effect pre-operative harvest fresh whole blood adult population show beneficial platelet protective effect , however concern rise amount volume need order sequester significant amount platelet would prohibit ally high cardiac surgical patient . Fresh blood harvesting evaluate pediatric population . The purpose present study would evaluate safety efficacy pre-operative blood harvest pediatric population undergo open heart surgery . Fresh whole blood harvest patient prior initiation cardiopulmonary bypass return patient discontinuation CPB prior administration prominent . Parameters evaluate include , patient characteristic , operative post-operative parameter , coagulation profile use postoperative blood product .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Blood Harvesting Administration End CPB Coagulation Profile</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All pediatric patient undergo open heart surgery institution randomize base last digit identification number ( even odd number ) undergo pre-operative whole blood harvesting ( PBH ) . Informed consent obtain parent time surgical informed consent acquisition . After scrub drape patient first set blood sample obtain baseline . Circuit prim perform use plasmalyte , prime adjust calculated bypass hematologic 27 % , take consideration amount blood harvest . Once patient connect CPB circuit , harvest blood take venous line passage oxygenator , crystalloids circuit infuse arterial line order maintain adequate blood pressure . Once amount 15cc/kg blood harvest , CPB initiate operation carry usual manner . Blood keep room temperature ( 18Â°C ) , gently stir ( shake ) . At end operation , veno-venous ultrafiltration perform , target duration 10 minute . The harvested blood administer end ultrafiltration conjunction administration protamine . Blood sample obtain various time point . Complete blood count , coagulation profile ( PT/PTT ) , platelet function test perform . Pre-operative operative characteristic record . In intensive care unit , patient continuously follow discharge hospital post-operative parameter record . Blood blood product administration base ICU protocol discretion attend physician . Generally , blood administer single ventricle patient hemoglobin level 12 mg % , 2 ventricle patient threshold 9mg % set . Administration blood product perform sign clinical bleed overt sign coagulopathy ( INR &gt; 2 , fibrinogen &lt; 100 , platelet &lt; 50,000 ) .</detailed_description>
