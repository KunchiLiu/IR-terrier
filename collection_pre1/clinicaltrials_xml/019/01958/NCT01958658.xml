	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 ( AZD1775 ) give together cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient cervical cancer . WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 together cisplatin radiation therapy may better treatment patient cervical cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) safety profile AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) combination cisplatin radiation patient cervical cancer ( phase I ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacodynamic effect AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) drug administer combination cisplatin radiation ( particular , 15 patient treated expansion cohort RP2D ) . Pharmacodynamic biomarkers include : phosphorylated cell division cycle protein 2 homolog ( pCDC2 ) , antigen Ki-67 ( Ki67 ) , gamma H2A histone family , member X ( gH2AX ) , phosphorylated ( phospho ) -histone 3 ( pH3 ) , cleave caspase-3 ( CC3 ) . II . To obtain preliminary information progression-free survival AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) combination standard radiation chemotherapy woman locally advance high-risk cervix cancer . III . To determine acute late toxicity AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) administer patient cervix cancer combination standard radiation concurrent chemotherapy . IV . To correlate serum pharmacokinetic parameters—maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , time peak concentration ( Tmax ) , 8-hours concentration ( C8 ) , area curve ( AUC ) ( 0-8 ) —with drug concentration tumor tissue ( patient expansion cohort ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 . Patients assign 1 3 treatment group . COHORT I : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-177 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-2 , 8-9 , 15-16 , 22-23 , 29-30 . COHORT II : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-177 PO BID day 4-5 , 11-12 , 18-19 , 25-26 , 32-33 day 3-5 , 10-12 , 17-19 , 24-26 , 31-33 . COHORT III : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-177 PO BID day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 . In cohort , patient also receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 undergo pelvic external beam radiation therapy 5 day week 5 week follow pulsed-dose rate high-dose rate brachytherapy 5 day week week 6-8 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
