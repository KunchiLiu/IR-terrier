	<detailed_description>Study hypothesis : We hypothesize AL efficacy might impair severely malnourished child , due impair bio-availability antimalarial drug population . Objectives : The general objective study answer question : `` Is current dose Artemether-Lumefantrine ( AL ) less efficacious severely malnourish compare non-severely malnourished child , impair bio-availability ? '' We aim ass whether current treatment dose adjust specific population . The primary objective study compare rate treatment failure ( PCR correction ) severely malnourish non-severely malnourished child . The secondary objective : - To compare bio-availability lumefantrine severely malnourish non-severely malnourished child ( AUC , concentration day 7… ) - To compare efficacy parameter ( rate early parasitological failure , early clinical failure , late therapeutic failure , reinfection recrudescence ) safety parameter severely malnourish non-severely malnourished child . - Additionally , If rate early parasitological failure appear high severely malnourished child , measure bio-availability artemisinin derivative compare severely malnourish non-severely malnourished child . Settings : This study conduct two site Mali Niger , two country affect malaria malnutrition , high malaria transmission roughly July December , correspond malnutrition peak . Study population : This study enrol child uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria age 6 59 month , accord WHO standardize protocol surveillance antimalarial drug efficacy . The definition severe acute malnutrition weight-for-height &lt; -3 z-scores reference WHO 2006 growth standard middle upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) &lt; 115 mm . The definition non-severe acute malnutrition weight-for-height z-score ≥-3 MUAC ≥115 mm . Severely stunted child ( height-for-age z -score &lt; -3 ) exclude study , primarily focus wasted child . The following modification inclusion criterion apply , compare standardise WHO protocol : - Decreased low level parasite density ( PD ) 2000 1000 parasite per micro litre , previous study show frequent low parasitemia patient . - In malnourished child arm , malnutrition &lt; -3 z-score inclusion criterion rather exclusion criterion . - Children complication acute malnutrition need intensive treatment exclude . Study procedure : Children screen renutrition center pediatric ward site . Two non-malnourished child enrol soon enrolment malnourish child ( ideally , week ) , allow carry inclusion parallel two study group , benefit term representativeness study population throughout malaria season . The ratio 2 non-severely malnourished child 1 severely malnourish choose low total number severely malnourish child recruit . Treatment intake supervise child followed-up 42 day , accord WHO standardize protocol4 . PCR use distinguish recrudescence re-infection . In malnourished child , standardize nutritional rehabilitation program also conduct parallel , weekly follow-up include assessment nutritional rehabilitation . Treatment adverse event monitor Data Safety Monitory Board ( DSMB ) institute . To assess bio-availability study drug , population pharmacokinetics approach use reduce number blood sample . Capillary blood collect filter paper measurement lumefantrine concentration , 5 time Day 0 day 7 . Assays use liquid chromatography technique tandem mass spectrometry . Statistical consideration : Efficacy analysis : The primary analysis compare efficacy AL malnourish child versus non-malnourished child . It design detect minimum crude difference 8 % Adequate Clinical Parasitological Response ( ACPR ) rate population malnourish child ( 87 % versus 95 % non-malnourished child treatment combination ) , statistical power 80 % 2-sided significance level 5 % . 160 severely malnourished child 320 non-severely malnourished child enrol . An additional 10 % add account loss follow-up exclusion , yield 180 malnourished child 360 non-malnourished child treatment evaluate . To summarize , total 540 child recruit whole . To answer primary objective study , use multivariate model ACPR explain malnutrition status adjustment baseline parasitemia , age , baseline characteristic differ two population child . Cox proportional hazard model logistic regression model use . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) analysis : A population pharmacokinetics approach use , accord WHO guideline recommend 5 sample window lumefantrine . Ideally , sample window contain equal number sample randomly distribute duration window . Alternatively , use fix , pre-determined sampling time within suggested window , fit sampling require protocol . The 5 blood sample collect 180 severely malnourished child enrol , 180 non-severely malnourished child ( randomly choose ) , allow u obtain data representative studied populations5 . To limit blood sample severely malnourished child , choose initially restrict PK assessment lumefantrine , exposure correlate overall treatment response5 . We possibility add dosage artemisinin derivative second phase , case `` relatively high '' observe rate early parasitological failure impair parasite clearance . Indeed , main pharmacodynamics effect initially ( first 3 day treatment ) artemisinin component5 . If parasite still present day 3 , could due under-exposure artemisinin component . Otherwise , reason suspect under-exposure . The DSMB responsibility monitor closely case early parasitological failure , recommend add artemether PK assessment reckon rate `` unexpectedly high '' . PK data analyse use nonlinear mixed-effects model ( external partnership ) . Benefits risk : Benefit participant receive free charge treatment confirm diagnosis malaria . Participants also benefit regular visit ensure treatment cleared malaria infection recurrent malaria episode emergence new disease treat quickly . Malnourished patient benefit standardized nutritional rehabilitation program . The child ask come study site regular check expose series blood sample would happen enrol study . Ethical regulatory consideration : The study fund MSF innovative fund . The protocol submit approval MSF Ethics Review Board Malian Institutional Ethics Committee . A DSMB closely monitor early parasitological failure , follow serious adverse event . An external monitoring perform study .</detailed_description>
