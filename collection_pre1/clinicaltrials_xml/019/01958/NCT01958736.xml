	<brief_summary>This pilot study intend evaluate whether stroke patient complete ballistic strength exercise thirty minute , three time per week six week training period addition exist rehabilitation program . It evaluate whether use ballistic training principle , superior improve mobility compare usual care exercise improve mobility leg strength stroke patient . In study 15 participant per group , total 30 participant . The control group receive usual care consistent exist rehabilitation practice literature . The experimental group perform task specific strength training ballistic fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ballistic Strength Training Stroke : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Aims : 1 . To establish feasibility ballistic strength train stroke 2 . To evaluate effect ballistic strength training exercise mobility outcome , strength quality life compare usual care . Methods : This wil prospective , randomize , control , assessor-blinded pilot study . It conduct 3 x per week 6 week ( i.e . total 18 session last 30 minute ) . Primary outcome measure : Feasibility - Recruitment - Retention/Attrition - Clinical Feasibility - Safety Secondary outcome measure - measure baseline completion - Ten metre walk test ( 10MWT ) comfortable pace - 10MWT maximum safe pace - High level mobility assessment tool ( HiMAT ) : Only participant 10MWT &lt; 12.5s baseline - Timed go test ( TUG ) - Functional Ambulation Category ( FAC ) - Health Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) via AQoL-4D Description intervention : Control Group : The control group complete suite exercise base upon exist rehabilitation practice aim improve mobility stroke . The supervise physiotherapist select progress exercise , record performance exercise exercise log detail incidence adverse event . Exercise selection include : gait retraining , cardiovascular fitness , low limb strengthening , static dynamic balance Experimental group : The experimental group complete jump squat leg sled , single leg toe push offs ( bilateral unable complete single ) , alternate leg ( i.e . bounding ) , mini tramp jumping , progress jogging , quick hip flexion bound land .</detailed_description>
