	<brief_title>Melbourne Infant Study - Bacille Calmette Guérin ( BCG ) Allergy &amp; Infection Reduction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There dramatic rise allergic disease worldwide since 1980s . Asthma rate increase first , follow eczema , allergic rhinitis , recently , food allergy - especially infant young child . In Australia , prevalence allergic disease particularly high : 30 % child affect , eczema asthma among common chronic disease childhood . Preventing allergic disease immunomodulatory intervention early life would major advance significant implication individual health public health resource . Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) immunisation potential intervention establish safety profile . This vaccine powerful non-specific effect cellular immune response potentially prime host immunity away allergic pathway . Observational data one small randomise control trial ( RCT ) suggest BCG immunisation birth lead substantial reduction allergic disease - however , absence level 1 evidence .</detailed_description>
