	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxant type drug use provide muscle relaxation induction anesthesia surgical treatment . Residual drug effect postoperatively ( i.e . residual muscle relaxation ) occur frequently study show may harmful certain group patient . Of special concern residual effect upper airway breathe muscle . A previous study show male female respond differently effect kind drug . It appear muscle group important airway protection breathe sensitive effect muscle relaxant male female . Males may therefore susceptible postoperative lung complication female . In study try determine cause observed sex-related difference response muscle relaxant Mivacurium . We previously show sex-related difference explain different pharmacokinetics ( body drug ) males female . Our hypothesis pharmacodynamic ( drug body ) difference sexes exists , i.e . low blood concentration Mivacurium need male female order obtain predefined degree muscle relaxation certain muscle group .</detailed_description>
