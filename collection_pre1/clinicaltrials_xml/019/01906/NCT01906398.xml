	<brief_summary>The purpose study obtain pilot data safety efficacy ketogenic diet ( KD ) adjunctive treatment adult refractory epilepsy . This open label study compare seizure frequency 4 month prospective baseline observation period seizure frequency 4 month add-on KD treatment . 18-65 year old men woman refractory epilepsy , define seizure persist spite past/present treatment ≥ 3 AEDs , seizure frequency ≥ 0.5/month , evaluate . Subjects primary generalize localization-related epilepsy ( PGE , LRE ) recruit . Subjects epilepsy least 2 year prior enrollment . Following initial screening , subject observed 4 month , change AEDs except deem necessary patient 's neurologist accord standard clinical care . Patients start ketogenic diet . Evaluations include seizure frequency use seizure diary , adverse event , treatment compliance use urine plasma ketone level . Quality life evaluate standardized questionnaire Quality Of Life In patient Epilepsy , QOLIE-31-P. Level alertness evaluate Epworth Sleepiness Scale . These questionnaire administer visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal present open label study obtain pilot data evaluate efficacy safety KD adult intractable epilepsy . Investigators evaluate effect KD seizure frequency adverse event . Investigators also evaluate serum level ketone body , βhydroxybutyrate ( BOH ) glucose order determine whether change serum level substance correlate KD-associated change seizure frequency . The data present study use design large randomize study . Laboratory evaluation include complete blood count ( CBC ) , serum electrolyte , include calcium , phosphate magnesium , renal liver function , include total protein albumin , uric acid , fast serum lipid profile , glucose b- hydroxybutyrate ( BOH ) level , serum carnitine level , serum a.m. trough antiepilepsy drug level , urine calcium creatinine level . They obtain twice baseline month apart monthly KD treatment . Primary outcome measure include average monthly seizure frequency adverse event . Secondary outcome measure include treatment compliance , quality life questionnaire ( QOLIE-31-P ) score , Epworth Sleepiness Scale score .</detailed_description>
