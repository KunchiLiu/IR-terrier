	<brief_summary>Eggs contain essential nutrient call choline adequate level choline require good health . Studies mouse demonstrate high level choline may increase risk heart disease process involve breakdown choline gut bacteria . Previous research show human consumption egg increase risk heart disease . This study design investigate whether number egg diet affect blood urine marker heart disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plasma Urine TMAO Formation Changes Oxidized LDL After Ingestion Different Amounts Egg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diets low choline adverse health consequence , observation human experiment mouse model suggest diet contain much choline phosphatidylcholine may activate inflammatory pathway increase cardiovascular disease risk bacterial conversion choline trimethylamine ( TMA ) subsequent oxidation trimethylamine N-oxide ( TMAO ) liver . What unclear whether choline phosphatidylcholine egg source TMAO formation , many egg must eat enough TMAO generate cause increase oxidize LDL ( biomarker atherosclerosis mechanism ) . We hypothesize TMAO form egg large quantity ingest TMAO formation vary greatly individual give dietary exposure . This variability determine 1 ) dose dietary choline phosphatidylcholine exceed absorptive capacity volunteer 's small intestine therefore spill large intestine gut bacteria access 2 ) bacterial population constitute volunteer 's microbiome .</detailed_description>
