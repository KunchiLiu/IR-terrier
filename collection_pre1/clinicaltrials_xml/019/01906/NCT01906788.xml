	<brief_title>The Optimal Timing Of Primaquine To Prevent Malaria Transmission After Artemisinin-Combination Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Global malaria elimination back agenda , gametocytocidal drug primaquine currently advocate use intervention aim interrupt malaria transmission hence elimination . Mature gametocytes responsible malaria transmission . Artemisinin base combination therapy ( ACTs ) limit effect young gametocyte . Primaquine able clear mature gametocytes remain treatment ACTs . Complete clearance mature gametocytes depend ideal time primaquine give ACT . It important therefore administer optimal time order significant impact clear gametocyte interrupt malaria transmission . An additional consideration operational administration Primaquine compliance likely enhance drug administer day diagnosis . In study , investigator aim determine optimal time primaquine administration addition ACT compare administration day 0 administration day 2 . The investigator ' primary end point gametocyte prevalence density microscopy Quantitative Nucleic Acid Based Amplification ( QT-NASBA ) day 14 , compare two primaquine treatment arm .</detailed_description>
