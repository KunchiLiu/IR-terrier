	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate effectiveness study drug , ACTH Gel people diagnose dermatomyositis disease cause muscle weakness associate rash ( DM ) polymyositis ( PM ) disease cause muscle weakness without rash . The study doctor want evaluate whether ACTH Gel improve symptom disease . This drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) dermatomyositis ( DM ) polymyositis ( PM ) . ACTH gel FDA-approved treatment myositis since 1952 , 2010 FDA retain PM DM diseases approve ACTH gel use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acthar Treatment Refractory Dermatomyositis Polymyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite FDA approval limit data clinical effectiveness PM DM . There recent study publish peer-review journal Drug Design , Development Therapy retrospective case series evaluate Acthar treatment PM DM . Acthar administer five patient previously fail multiple steroid immunosuppressant treatment regimen . The patient receive injection Acthar course 12 week . Improvement PM DM symptom related disease exacerbation see five patient . Symptom improvement include increased muscle strength , resolution disease-related skin manifestation improvement ability perform task associate daily live . All patient tolerate treatment well significant side effect report . The paper , `` Treating refractory dermatomyositis polymyositis adrenocorticotropic hormone gel : retrospective case series , '' author Dr. Todd Levine , M.D. , Co-Director Neurophysiology Department Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center , Assistant Professor University Arizona Neurology , Member Phoenix Neurological Associates . H.P . Acthar® Gel , Acthar , prescription medication contain hormone adrenocorticotropin ( hormone produce secreted anterior pituitary gland ) , also know ACTH . H.P . Acthar Gel highly purify preparation adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) gel design provide extended release ACTH follow injection . Acthar originally approve FDA 1952 . It approve use 19 different condition include dermatomyositis polymyositis . Acthar design provide prolonged release medication inject . Acthar steroid ; work help body produce natural steroid hormone , cortisol , corticosterone , aldosterone . Acthar injection give intramuscularly ( muscle ) . Subjects enrol study ask self administer Acthar two time per week . Subjects provide training principal investigator perform self injection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Definite probable polymyositis ( PM ) dermatomyositis ( DM ) Bohan Peter criterion . PM patient must either possess myositisassociated autoantibody undergo adjudication confirmation PM diagnosis consensus two expert ensure nonPM patient enrol . This step necessary since wellknown mimic PM . Age ≥ 18 year . Active myositis define baseline Manual Muscle Testing ( MMT8 ) great 125/150 least 2 additional CSM meeting criterion stipulate : 1 . Patient global minimum value 2.0 cm 10 cm visual analog scale ( VAS ) 2 . Physician global minimum value 2.0 cm 10 cm VAS scale 3 . Health Assessment Questionnaire ( HAQ ) disability index minimum value 0.25 4 . Elevation least one muscle enzymes [ include creatine kinase ( CK ) , aldolase , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ] minimum level 1.3 x upper limit normal . 5 . Global extramuscular disease activity score minimum value 1.0 cm 10 cm VAS scale [ measure physician 's composite evaluation base assessment activity score constitutional , cutaneous , skeletal , gastrointestinal , pulmonary cardiac scale Myositis Disease Activity Assessment Tool ( MDAAT ) ] . To ensure enroll active DM patient severe rash may meet MMT8 criterion note , propose additional enrollment criterion International Myositis Assessment Clinical Studies ( IMACS ) definition improvement ( DOI ) potentially meet : 1 . Cutaneous VAS score MDAAT &gt; 3 cm 10 cm VAS scale , 2 . At least 3 5 ( e 4 . ) criterion . Refractory myositis define active disease despite adequate glucocorticoid trial ( &gt; 2 month usual glucocorticoid therapy intolerance therapy ) and/or ≥ 1 conventional immunosuppressive agent ( e.g . methotrexate , azathioprine , tacrolimus , cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil , IVIG , antiTNF rituximab ) reasonable dose duration ( &gt; 3 month intolerance therapy ) . It recommend enroll refractory patient fail ( intolerant ) glucocorticoid least 1 conventional immunosuppressive agent . If enrol physician planning continue current immunosuppressive agent glucocorticoid concomitant therapy Acthar gel trial , patient must stable glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressive dose 2 week prior visit 1 . The patient immunosuppressive medication least 8 week ( least 4 week glucocorticoid ) prior visit 1 . If enrol physician planning discontinue current immunosuppressive agent glucocorticoid , follow wash period require prior visit 1 . If previous concomitant medication discontinue , follow wash period require prior Visit 1 Methotrexate 4 week Other IS agent ( e.g . azathioprine , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , leflunomide , mycophenolate mofetil ) 4 week IVIg cyclophosphamide 2 month rituximab 6 month infliximab adalimumab 8 week glucocorticoids 2 week etanercept 2 week anakinra 1 week Juvenile DM PM , myositis overlap another connective tissue disease , cancer associate myositis , inclusion body myositis , non immunemediated myopathy . Hypersensitivity Acthar Severe cardiac pulmonary involvement Severe muscle damage define baseline global muscle damage score MDI ( Myositis Damage Index ) ≥ 5 cm 10 cm VAS . Patients malignancy within 3 year screen ( except basal cell cancer squamous cell cancer skin ) . Uncontrolled diabetes , hepatic renal disease . Ongoing active chronic infection . Pregnant lactating female . For medical physical sociopsychological reason PI feel would allow subject complete study .</criteria>
