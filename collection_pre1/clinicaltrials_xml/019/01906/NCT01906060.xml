	<brief_summary>The disposable Air-Q self-inflating laryngeal intubation mask ( Air-Q , Mercury Medical , Clearwater , FL , USA ) extra-glottic airway device enables blind intubation tracheal tube . This intubate laryngeal airway device ( ILA ) already commercially available worldwide certificate ( CE 0482 ) , data success rate blind intubation via device adult patient lack . Success rate blind intubation non-self-inflating device range 57 97 % . Although self-inflating disposable Air-Q device certify blind intubation , success rate rate adverse event associated procedure publish far . In study compare adverse event conventional intubation blind intubation via different supra-glottic airway device ( ILMA ) rate sore throat cough comparable group report 10-17 % patient . In pilot study use non-self-inflating Air-Q blind intubation 19 patient , 10 % report dysphagia one patient bilateral lingual nerve injury self-limited . One study use self-pressurised disposable Air-Q ventilation child show broncho- laryngospasm 3 % mucosal damage blood stain ILA sore throat report 1 % . This data suggest rate adverse event use Air-Q supra-glottic device comparable device LMA . - Trial medical device</brief_summary>
