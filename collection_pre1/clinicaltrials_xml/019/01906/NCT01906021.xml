	<brief_summary>Background : - Ablation procedure heat tumor tissue high temperature destroy . Doctors perform procedure put probe tumor . This deliver heat site . Currently , doctor tell area heat use probe manufacturer estimate . These estimate imprecise . Doctors insert small needle measure temperature around area heat . Doctors also perform scan area , show tissue heat . Right , contrast scan show . But researcher develop software us image routine scan create temperature map . They want test software see doctor monitor procedure without use needle without contrast scan . Objectives : - To test software might help doctor perform ablation good future . Eligibility : - People 18 year age already schedule ablation . Design : - Participants screen medical history . - Participants visit clinic already-scheduled ablation . The doctor use study software analyze temperature area heat . The software come contact participant body . - Participants undergo scan necessary procedure , one two additional scan may do part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Lack reliable non-invasive method monitor ablation zone radiofrequency microwave ablation - Development non-invasive technique examine temperature change base change CT CBCT attenuation Objectives : -To measure accuracy temperature monitor use non-invasive thermomap ( temperature image profile ) method compare currently accept invasive thermocouple method . Eligibility : - Subjects eligible : -- They schedule interventional radiology hepatic radiofrequency microwave ablation require thermocouple monitor - Subjects exclude : - An altered mental status preclude understand consent procedure - A gross body weight exceed 375 pound ( upper limit angio table ) - A pregnancy Design : - Number participant : 16 - Number site : 1 - Recruitment time frame : 2 year - Type study : pilot study validate image analysis thermometry technique - Patients undergo clinically indicate hepatic ablation eligible protocol . As part study , one two additional research scan liver may acquire ablation analyze separately software compare thermocouple measurement . There change device , probe additional probe manipulation part study . The operator modify procedure base result software .</detailed_description>
