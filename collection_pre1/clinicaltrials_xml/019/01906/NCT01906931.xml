	<brief_summary>People interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) frequently prescribe ambulatory oxygen , increase oxygen level blood daily activity . The best way deliver type oxygen establish . The aim study compare two device deliver oxygen people interstitial lung disease - traditional method use portable cylinder newer method use portable concentrator . The investigator hypothesise oxygen level exercise significantly high use portable cylinder , difference small .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise-induced hypoxaemia ( EIA ) common individual ILD , due progressive lung fibrosis result impair gas exchange . It common people EIA prescribe ambulatory oxygen , order normalize oxyhaemoglobin saturation , improve oxygen delivery tissue relieve breathlessness daily activity . Ambulatory oxygen traditionally deliver via refillable portable oxygen cylinder contain compress gaseous oxygen . More recently , portable oxygen concentrators ( POCs ) emerge solution problem finite cylinder life improve portability . Because concentrator constantly extract oxygen air , oxygen supply continue long battery charge . This typically around eight hour , POCs recharge AC DC power source . Portable oxygen concentrators usually weigh around 3.5kg , significantly light oxygen cylinder , much easy maneuver . However , theoretical disadvantage POCs . Like concentrators , deliver 100 % oxygen . Concentrations typically range 85-95 % , depend flow rate . Differences pulse time peak pulse flow POCs may affect fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) deliver . However , clinical implication difference document . The aim study compare effect ambulatory oxygen deliver exercise use EverGo POC ambulatory oxygen deliver standard portable cylinder individual ILD . We hypothesise oxyhaemoglobin saturation exercise significantly higher use portable cylinder , difference clinically important .</detailed_description>
