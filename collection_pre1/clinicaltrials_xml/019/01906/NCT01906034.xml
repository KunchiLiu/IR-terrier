	<brief_summary>Background With increase age neuromuscular deficit ( e.g. , sarcopenia ) may result impaired physical performance increase risk fall . Prominent intrinsic fall-risk factor age-related decrease balance strength / power performance well cognitive decline . Additional study need develop specifically tailor exercise program older adult easily implement clinical practice . Thus , objective present trial ass effect fall prevention program develop interdisciplinary expert panel measure balance , strength / power , body composition , cognition , psychosocial well-being , fall self-efficacy healthy old adult . Additionally , time-related effect detrain test . Methods/Design Healthy old people ( N = 66 ) age 65 80 year participate trial . The test protocol comprises test assessment static / dynamic steady-state balance ( i.e. , Sharpened Romberg Test , instrument gait analysis ) , proactive balance ( i.e. , Functional Reach Test ; Timed Up Go Test ) , reactive balance ( i.e. , perturbation test bipedal stance ; Push Release Test ) , strength ( i.e. , hand grip strength test ; Chair Stand Test ) , power ( i.e. , Stair Climb Power Test ) . Further , body composition analyse use bioelectrical impedance analysis system . In addition , questionnaires assessment psychosocial ( i.e. , World Health Organisation Quality Life Assessment-Bref ) , cognitive ( i.e. , Mini Mental State Examination ) , fall risk determinant ( i.e. , Fall Efficacy Scale - International ) include study protocol . Participants randomize two intervention group control / wait group . After baseline measure , participant intervention group conduct 12-week balance strength / power exercise intervention 3 time per week , train session last 30 min ( without warm-up cool-down ) . One intervention group complete supervise training program ( 2x supervise training per week / 1x home training per week ) , intervention group complete training protocol home-based ( 3x home training per week ) control phone call every two week . Post-tests conduct right intervention period . Additionally , detrain effect measure 12 week program cessation . The control group / wait group participate specific intervention experimental period , receive extensive supervise program experimental period . Discussion It expect particularly supervise combination balance strength / power training improve performance variable balance , strength / power , body composition , cognitive function , psychosocial well-being , fall self-efficacy older adult . In addition , information regard fall risk assessment , detrain effect , supervision training provide . Further , training-induced health-relevant change , improved performance activity daily live , cognitive function , quality life , well reduce risk fall may help low cost health care system . Finally , practitioner , therapist , instructor provide scientifically evaluate , feasible , safe , easy-to-administer exercise program fall prevention .</brief_summary>
