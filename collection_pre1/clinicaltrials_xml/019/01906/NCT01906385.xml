	<brief_summary>While radiation essential component treatment glioblastoma , 's use limit due toxicity high dos attempt . Rhenium compund release radiation small particle absorb fraction inch . This limited penetration mean high dos potentially give without toxicity form radiation . In order radiaiton retain within tumor , package microscopic fat like particle term nanoliposomes . These facilitate uptake radiation particle tumor . In order well characterize form radiation therapy , administer patient fail form therapy glioblastoma . The treatment administer tube insert center tumor operate room . There two portionms study . The first involve progressively increase dos tolerable dose identify . The second portion study involve large number patient treat determined tolerable dose well evalaute well treatment work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maximum Tolerated Dose , Safety , Efficacy Rhenium Nanoliposomes Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rhenium-186 ( 186Re ) ( half-life 90 hour ) reactor produce isotope great potential medical therapy . It chemical family Technetium-99m ( 99mTc ) , radioactive tracer commonly use isotope diagnostic scintigraphic image nuclear medicine . Like 99mTc , rhenium take bone readily clear kidney . 186Re emits therapeutic beta particle every 10 isotope decay associate gamma photon . The average 186Re beta particle path length tissue 2mm ideal treatment solid tumor . Additionally , emit gamma photon similar photon energy emit 99mTc , therefore allow image isotope within body standard nuclear image machine available routine medical practice . Therefore , 186Re isotope great potential CED application local therapy solid tumor . However , carrier need deliver isotope brain maintain localization desire site , otherwise would quickly disperse carry away site injection circulatory system . Liposomes spontaneously forming lipid nanoparticles well study 30 year . Although large liposome manufacture , useful size range drug carrier application 80-100 nm . Liposomes size often refer nanoliposomes ability facilitate retention site injection . A method efficient load liposome high level specific activity develop . These rhenium-labeled nanoliposomes ( 186RNL ) show great promise preclinical study 186RNL glioblastoma surpass result typically see currently standard treatment modality oral temozolomide intravenous bevacizumab . This single center , sequential cohort , open-label , dose-escalation study safety , tolerability , distribution 186RNL give convection enhance delivery patient recurrent progressive malignant glioma standard surgical , radiation , and/or chemotherapy treatment .</detailed_description>
