	<brief_summary>A study test effectiveness investigational imaging technique detect cardiac injury administration certain chemotherapy , doxorubicin . `` Investigational '' mean imaging technique still study research doctor try find it- whether technique detect low level cardiac injury treatment doxorubicin . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve use gadolinium approve use CMR study detection cardiac toxicity doxorubicin . The chemotherapy drug schedule treat , doxorubicin , associate development heart failure patient . Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) type MRI scan us magnetic field produce picture heart . The CMR scan use study information research study suggest image technique may help good detect difference structure heart muscle treatment doxorubicin . In research study , hope good detect change heart muscle treatment doxorubicin CMR scan hope cardiac injury detect treat earlier ultimately prevent possible development heart failure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If choose take part study , ask sign consent form study procedure . All participant come CMR scan prior first treatment doxorubicin - Visit 1 Visit 1 take place prior start chemotherapy . The visit take 1.5 hour . We ask come Shapiro Cardiovascular Center Brigham Women 's Hospital Massachusetts General Hospital study visit . For subject qualify , bring heart CMR scan , echocardiogram blood work . Blood testing : Before CMR scan take blood via IV cannula . We take 4 tube blood . This equivalent 2 ½ tablespoon blood . From blood test blood marker cardiac injury compare result test . CMR Scan : For CMR scan , ask lie still scanner table slide tunnel-shaped machine . Four electrocardiogram ( EKG ) patch wire attach place chest back check heart rate . We place intravenous ( IV ) catheter one arm . An IV catheter thin plastic tube put vein needle . The IV catheter use give CMR contrast dye ( gadolinium ) . The dye help u identify subtle change within heart muscle . This dye , gadolinium , use routinely CMR study . We also draw sample blood IV catheter measure red blood cell count . Then , scanner table move slowly tunnel-shaped CMR machine picture take . The machine slightly wide body may little room move . If feel discomfort need stop test , able tell research staff . You able speak CMR able speak . If think might anxious inside narrow CMR scanner long period time , may prescribe drug call help relax think might helpful . The CMR scan take one hour . Echocardiogram : An echocardiogram test use doctor monitor heart function . An echocardiogram safe test use ultrasound image heart . After completion CMR test , echocardiogram . This test take place area CMR test . The echocardiogram test take 40 minute . - Visit 2 : Visit 2 take place 2-4 week last cycle doxorubicin chemotherapy . When come back Visit 2 , type CMR scan , echocardiogram blood test Visit 1 . - Visit 3 : At visit three perform exercise test bicycle . The test design test oxygen consumption body exercise . It provide way quantify ability body exercise . This test take 30 minute . During test subject sit bicycle least 3 minute pedal rate 60 cycle per minute slowly work-load increase peak exercise obtain . We define peak exercise tire breathless . Heart rate blood pressure record test . During test breathe mouthpiece measure oxygen level .</detailed_description>
