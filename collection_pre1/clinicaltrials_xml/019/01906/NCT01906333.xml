	<brief_summary>There increase evidence skeletal muscle lipid content ( IntraMyoCellular Lipid , IMCL ) markedly increase risk metabolic complication , include insulin resistance cardiovascular event . The investigator hypothesize skeletal muscle passively take FFAs availability high , thereby lead increase storage . To test hypothesis , investigator want manipulate FFA level , mean exercise , monitor intramuscular lipid content . Therefore objective examine effect exercise-induced elevation FFA skeletal muscle lipid content healthy lean men . To end , skeletal muscle lipid content investigate baseline exercise protocol four-hour recovery period exercise , condition high FFA concentration , low FFA concentration . To achieve high- versus low FFA concentration , exercise protocol chosen participant perform protocol glucose supplementation without . Skeletal muscle lipid content determine , directly exercise 4 h post exercise ( muscle biopsy ) without glucose supplementation .</brief_summary>
