	<brief_title>Pharmacy Intervention Team Hospital-based ( PITH ) People Study : Effect Clinical Economic Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2006 report `` Preventing Medication Errors , '' Institute Medicine ( IOM ) estimate 1.5 million adverse drug event ( ADEs ) occur annually United States . On average , every hospital patient subject least one medication error every day . Medication error frequent cause ADEs . ADEs usually define 'any injury due medication use , include omission ' . This may occur unavoidable result pharmacological action ( well know side effect adverse drug reaction ( ADR ) ) manner drug apply ( medication error preventable ADE ) . ADEs regard top iceberg contain problem associate drug therapy also know Drug-Related Problems ( DRPs ) . This mean besides ADEs , DRPs include medication relate problem like ADRs , medication error , non-adherence inadequate use medication patient . All event result harm patient . The wide variation prevalence ADEs find literature explain difference study setting , study population , outcome ( ADRs , ADEs ) data collection method . Anticipating suffer ADE , , medication difficult . Research yet identify valid predictor event . Patient characteristic currently useful predictor ADE patient suffer ADEs non homogeneous group . Although old age , severity illness , intensity treatment , poly-pharmacy associate ADEs , cause effect relationship know exist patient suffer ADEs age , comorbidity , number drug receive . Around time hospitalization 15 72 % harmful event attribute ADEs medication error . ADEs associate substantial morbidity , increase mortality longer length stay hospital direct cost . Nearly 1 % ( 0,946 ) patient die admission internal medicine department , associate use one drug admission . Furthermore , recent investigation among 21 Dutch hospital Hoonhout et al . reveal excess length stay 6,2 day ( 95 % CI 3.6,8.8 ) result medication relate adverse event . This figure comparable American situation . Patients suffer less severe ADEs ( require change therapy long hospital stay ) average stay 13 day , patient suffer ADE average stay 5 day . As result , common reason admission include avoidable ADEs . Gillespie et al . investigated effect ward base pharmacist hospital admission amongst 80 year old patient . After 12 month risk medication relate readmission reduce intervention group 80 % OR 0.20 ( 95 % CI 0.10 , 0.41 ) . However , total number readmission ( include medication relate ) show balanced outcome intervention control group . Generally speak , study show statistical significant impact pharmacist intervention ( ) hospital readmission . Factors influence ( ) hospitalization complex comprise least medical condition age . The pharmacist show effective reduce number DRPs ADEs study establish effect healthcare utilization far . A recent Cochrane review discharge planning reveal structure discharge plan tailor individual patient probably bring small reduction hospital length stay readmission rate older people admit hospital . This line result Institute Healthcare Improvement survey : multi faceted program comprising close coordination care post-acute period , early post-discharge follow-up , enhance patient education self-management training , reduce number rehospitalizations . For reason design multifaceted program comprise series intervention : admission , hospital stay discharge counsel information transfer healthcare professional . Key intervention process medication reconciliation . Medication reconciliation describe `` process obtain complete accurate list patient 's current home medications—including name , dosage , frequency , route administration—and compare physician 's admission , transfer , and/or discharge order list '' , goal provide patient correct medication . The Joint Commission International ( JCI ) , accredit authority World Health Organization ( WHO ) mandate medication reconciliation key towards reduction medication error related transition healthcare setting . In line overseas regulation , Dutch authority command comparable protocol since January 2011 . Pharmacy driven medication reconciliation intervention often practise ( clinical ) pharmacist train technician . The efficacy intervention assess various constitution team : technician pharmacists in-between form well ambulatory hospital set . Many study find successful regard significant reduction medication error impact clinical outcome . Other setting , small sample intervention particular without transition information , appear less flourish specifically regard economic outcome . Interestingly , although Dutch authority mandate medication reconciliation obligatory part healthcare , study perform measure effect intervention . Therefore , effect intervention hospital base pharmacy team number unplanned re-hospitalizations ADEs frequency medication relate harm result ADEs , mixed unknown . Furthermore , study address extent ADRs ADEs amongst acutely electively admitted patient detect diminished pharmacist . Also , limited data exist regard difference prevalence ADRs ADEs study ward . It thus appear subject still address . Therefore , study perform establish impact hospital pharmacy team number economic impact unplanned re-hospitalizations . To determine independent contribution various factor primary endpoint , age , sex , Charlson Co-morbidity index , renal function , hospital site , ward type , admit 6 month index admission , quality live ( EuroQoL D5 ) , culture ward , patient healthcare professional satisfaction use high risk drug include logistic regression analysis . Also , occurence DRPs ADEs , focus reduction frequency ADEs time spend pharmacy team subsequent cost per prevent ADE DRP compare usual pharmaceutical care calculate . Other healthcare us like emergency department visit , length stay , general practitioner consultation drug consumption post discharge period study . The research question : - Does introduction protocolised medication reconciliation discharge service hospital pharmacy team influence number unplanned re-hospitalizations ADEs ? - What DRPs occur often DRPs occur ? Which DRPs highly correlate unplanned readmission ADEs ? - Does introduction protocolised medication reconciliation hospital pharmacy team influence insurance cost cause reduction length hospital stay , number unplanned re-hospitalizations readmission , emergency visit , general practitioner visit , direct medicine cost within 14 day , 3 6 month index admission ? Can extract information cost per prevent ADE ? - Is satisfaction information medicine include patient change compare control ? - Is satisfaction introduction pharmaceutical team medication reconciliation healthcare professional change compare control ? - Which patient circumstance high risk DRP ADEs ? - What time spend patient centre medication reconciliation , discharge counselling , intermediate medication review ? Design A multi - centre prospective , before-after study perform . Each 4-6 participating center select predefined ward , namely emergency department , internal medicine , neurology , surgery , cardiology . Per ward type 300 patient plan include , comprise before- period . Thus , 150 patient per arm per ward include . First , 3 4 month period baseline assessment hospital participate ward perform ( control usual care group ) . Secondly , intervention implement include study ward , brief education hospital pharmacy team . Finally , 3 4 month intervention phase , patient include . Both group follow-up period 6 month .</detailed_description>
