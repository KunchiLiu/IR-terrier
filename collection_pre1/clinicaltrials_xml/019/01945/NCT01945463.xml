	<brief_summary>Breast augmentation surgery currently common elective plastic surgery perform US . With regard surgical technique , 4 incisional site available breast augmentation , advantage disadvantage : Axillary , Periareolar , inframammary , umbilical . The implant insert either subglandular ( beneath breast tissue ) , submuscular ( underneath Pectoralis Major ) , `` dual-plane '' ( combination ) manner . Echocardiography commonly use diagnostic test cardiology evaluation cardiac structure function . Its use increase dramatically last decade . We encounter three woman congenital heart disease undergone breast augmentation , echocardiographic image significantly limited implantation . There one case report medical literature suggest breast implant interfere echocardiographic view . The underlying physical property silicone breast implant cause interference ultrasound beam echocardiographic examination know study . Similar air lung less degree , silicone breast implant appear prevent penetration ultrasound beam . The poor penetration appear persistent unrevealing despite increase gain change ultrasound wave 's frequency . Many woman elect breast augmentation cosmetic reason . Women congenital heart disease undergone cardiac surgery may breast asymmetry distortion desire augmentation accordingly . Knowledge extent impairment breast implant echocardiographic examination important reason : 1 . Women heart disease need echocardiographic follow wish undergo breast augmentation consult limitation echocardiographic examination follow procedure . 2 . Women without heart disease consider breast augmentation inform potential echocardiographic interference , echocardiography need future , 3 . Different surgical technique may cause different mask effect . 4 . Different implant size shape may cause different mask effect .</brief_summary>
