	<brief_summary>Background : Atrial fibrillation common heart rhythm disturbance affect 1-2 % western population . It may cause symptom irregular heartbeat , shortness breath , fatigue . It may also asymptomatic ( ie `` silent atrial fibrillation ) . In case , atrial fibrillation permanent whereas others sporadic . Regardless symptom , increase risk stroke patient condition . Novel technology develop increase detection silent atrial fibrillation , order find patient might benefit treatment oral anticoagulant ( blood-thinning medication ) order reduce risk stroke . One technologies thumb-ECG , simple way patient heart rhythm reliably analyze home . Hyperthyroidism ( sometimes refer `` toxic goiter '' ) define excessive production thyroid hormone . It known hyperthyroidism may cause atrial fibrillation 8 % case . Objective : To provide thumb-ECG-monitors hyperthyroid patient treat hormonal disturbance , order find episodes silent atrial fibrillation . Design : Prospective observational study . Hypotheses : - Primary hypothesis : Silent atrial fibrillation least common overt atrial fibrillation hyperthyroid patient . - Secondary hypothesis nr 1 : Atrial fibrillation continue prevalent compare normal population even hyperthyroidism treat . - Secondary hypothesis nr 2 : The majority patient hyperthyroidism atrial fibrillation increase risk stroke consider treatment oral anticoagulant .</brief_summary>
