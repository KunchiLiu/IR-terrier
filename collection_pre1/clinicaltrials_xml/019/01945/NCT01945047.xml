	<brief_summary>Depression carry large burden medical disorder middle high income country , determine World Health Organization . Despite many antidepressant strategy , third patient get well first treatment third remain ill several treatment . Moreover , antidepressant treatment delay action range several week . Ketamine ( KET ) use decade sedative anesthetic . In treatment-resistant depressed patient ( TRD ) , intravenous dose much low necessary anesthesia may produce robust antidepressant effect may even abolish suicidal thought within hour , peak within 24 hour . But , antidepressant effect generally last days.Previous study examine KET TRD critique lack effective placebo measure due brief perceptual experience associate KET . Thus , current study compare KET short-acting sedative . The phase study compare response single KET injection 6 injection 2 week . Next , KET responder give 1 injection week 3 week either KET sedative agent determine beneficial effect KET maintain , assess duration benefit repeat administration . The genetic profile patient substance promote contact cell brain determine investigate response KET could predict blood test . This substance , well several chemical produce inflammation , also measure blood investigate role effect KET . Patients receive , total , equivalent two three anesthetic dose KET . Results study help establish beneficial effect single KET injection rapid intervention major depression , investigate possibility obtain prolonged antidepressant effect repeat injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) carry worldwide large burden disease among mental , neurological , substance-use disorder measure Disability Adjusted Life Years ( DALYs ) , accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) .1 In turn , MDD high DALYs middle high income country , ischemic cardiac disease second.2 Although effective treatment MDD , large proportion patient achieve remission even several attempt , significant response , manifest , take place delay weeks.3,4 There always urgency treat MDD although patient may ill several week , month , sometimes year , often crisis situation consult . The nature crisis may familial , financial/professional , consultation may take place intense personal suffering , possibly involve suicidal ideation . Consequently , rapid therapeutic action high remission rate represent two major unmet need MDD . In last year , considerable attention dedicate glutamate system possible contributor antidepressant response . The striking breakthrough rapid antidepressant response intravenous ketamine use dos quarter routinely utilized anesthetic dose child adults.5,6 Unlike many anesthetic agent , ketamine depress cardiovascular respiratory parameters.7 The primary action ketamine block N-Methyl-D-Aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . The antidepressant response ketamine often manifest within hour , generally maximal 24 hours.8 Importantly , single infusion produce subject robust decrease suicidal ideation.9,10 The drawback approach , however , benefit generally disappear within week.6 Consequently , much clinical work remain carried order well understand maintain antidepressant response ketamine . Specific aim # 1 : The first aim proposal characterize antidepressant action single dose ketamine truly double-blind paradigm . Indeed , even low dos ketamine ( 0.2-0.5 mg/kg ) 8,11 produce mild derealization therefore use mere saline solution prior study inadequate control . 1 . To show infusion low dose short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam serve adequate active control ketamine . It hypothesize midazolam produce mark sedation , serve adequate control . 2 . To determine brain-derived neutrophic factor ( BDNF ) mediate antidepressant response . In mouse , VAL/MET polymorphism BDNF gene , ketamine devoid effect . The influence polymorphism evaluate patient . Specific aim # 2 : The second goal proposal attempt enhance prolong antidepressant effect ketamine give repeatedly rate three infusion per week two consecutive week . 1 . To assess whether ketamine responder improve six infusion two week . It hypothesize ketamine non-responders follow single infusion show significant improvement repeat infusion ketamine dose 0.5 mg/kg give three time week two week , responder repeat ketamine produce robust sustain antidepressant action single infusion . 2 . To assess whether inflammatory status depress patient altered response ketamine . Pro-inflammatory mediator cortisol generally elevate depression melatonin decrease . These anomaly typically restore effective treatment . This investigated light rapid antidepressant effect ketamine . Specific aim # 3 : The third goal proposal prolong antidepressant effect ketamine . In third consecutive phase project , ketamine-responsive patient receive ketamine weekly basis . 1 ) To demonstrate antidepressant effect ketamine sustain four week use single infusion per week . The antidepressant response single infusion ketamine disappear within 7 day . It hypothesize repeated infusion ketamine , interval one week four week , maintain antidepressant effect . 2 ) To assess long antidepressant effect repeat ketamine infusion last follow . After first three phase project last eight week , average duration standard antidepressant medication trial , responder monitor follow clinical evolution . It hypothesize responder show long maintenance response first infusion phase one project . 1 . Phase I : double-blind crossover . After patient deem eligible participate study , blood drawn genotyping various assay ( BDNF Val/Met , BDNF , morning melatonin salivary cortisol , C-reactive protein , IL-1β , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-12 , IFN-γ , TNF-α , anti-inflammatory factor IL-4 IL-10 , previously do laboratory ) .101-102 They randomize receive intravenously either 0.5 mg/kg ketamine ( readily available racemic mixture ) 30 µg/kg midazolam 250 ml infusion ( prepared unit ) 40 minute , give research nurse presence study physician . Their antidepressant drug regimen alter throughout study . A clinician evaluate clinical status prior infusion , use Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) 103 Clinical Global Intensity-Severity ( CGI-S ) 104 patient rate use Quick Inventory Depressive Symptoms-Self-report ( QIDS-SR ) 105 self-report questionnaire rating suicidality . The patient assess use Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-positive symptom scale106 baseline ( infusion ) , time 0 ( immediately infusion complete ) , 60 120 minute post time 0 . The CGI-Improvement ( CGI-I ) 104 use obtain clinical evaluation overall change condition two hour discharge patient two hour infusion . The patient come next day evaluation use MADRS , CGIs , QIDS-SR ask guess drug receive . Four day infusion , patient repeat QIDS-SR home , come evaluation day 7 . If patient respond , return 80 % MADRS score infusion , receive either ketamine midazolam complete crossover protocol . If patient maintain 20 % improvement baseline MADRS score , ask come weekly basis assessment , ask complete QIDS-SR twice week ( day 10 , 14 , 18 , 21 , ) order ass long therapeutic effect last . Patients response second infusion find relapsed weekly follow-up visit , continue phase II . Patients unable , ineligible , unwilling enter phase II give recommend treatment plan return family physician consultation plan , additional/alternative treatment option discretion study physician . In order obtain objective measure activity level pattern sleep-wake cycle , patient wear actimeter watch several day screen throughout protocol . The data download weekly visit . 2 . Phase II : repeat treatment two week . Once patient deem responded second infusion lose improvement ( relapse MADRS score 80 % baseline score prior second infusion ) , receive repeat ketamine infusion ( 0.5 mg/kg ) . They give 3 infusion per week two week . On visit 6 phase 2 patient assess use Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-positive symptom scale106 baseline ( infusion ) , time 0 ( immediately infusion complete ) , 60 120 minute post time 0 . Their clinical status assess prior infusion use MADRS , CGI-S , CGI-I , rate use QIDS-SR self-report questionnaire rating suicidality . Patients assess two three day sixth infusion . The rating throughout phase II help determine whether repeated administration produce great sustain improvement single infusion . Biological assay repeat end Phase II . 3 . Phase III : repeat treatment four week naturalistic follow-up . Two three day sixth infusion , patient achieve 50 % improvement MADRS score , compare baseline score prior first six infusion , take study offer treat Research Unit use additional pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic approach . Patients improve 50 % MADRS scale receive ketamine week four week . They assess use scale mention prior infusion . Patients assess two three day fourth weekly infusion . The rating throughout phase III help determine whether repeated administration ketamine effective maintain beneficial action relatively intense regimen ketamine . Monitoring patient reach 80 % MADRS score , compare baseline score prior last four infusion , cease offer treat Research Unit use additional pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic approach . Patients maintain 20 % improvement assess weekly determine long therapeutic effect ketamine last . Biological assay repeat end Phase III .</detailed_description>
