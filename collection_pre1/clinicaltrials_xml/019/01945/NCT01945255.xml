	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause mortality patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , mean important find risk factor CVD order prevent treat . In recent year , recognition high prevalence CV calcification ESRD population . Many observational cohort study show CV calcification patient predict mortality , CV mortality morbidity . Electrolyte imbalance easily find ESRD patient may result vessel calcification . Calcification lead arterial stenosis increase arterial stiffness heart afterload , contribute development CVD . Besides , metabolic syndrome , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia pave way chronic , immune-mediated vascular inflammation cardiovascular disease . These factor prevalent ESRD patient , would also cause arterial stiffness . Arterial stiffness stenosis would increase risk CV event mortality . Aortic pulse wave velocity strongly associate presence extent atherosclerosis constitute forceful marker predictor cardiovascular risk . At time , high prevalence peripheral artery occlusion disease ( PAOD ) also find arterial stiffness stenosis , would increase condition infection gangrene . Thus , life safety quality would influence severely early detection might prevent future amputation . Uremic patient also high risk metabolic syndrome . Therefore , study evaluate condition arterial stiffness PAOD , especially HD patient , need future management prevention CV related morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
