	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine vitamin D status Israeli woman undergo ART . We want evaluate influence hyper Vitamin D level low vitamin D level IVF -ICSI cycle . We evaluate well influence increase estradiol level IVF-ICSI cycle peripheral vitamin D. We plan follow vitamin D infertile woman undergo IVF treatment various indication , baseline , control ovarian hyperstimulation . Their level measure baseline ( first present basic investigation clinic ) , down-regulation phase treatment ( protocol down-regulation phase ) , follow-up visit stimulation ( ask present measurement estradiol ( E2 ) level ) , well conclusion treatment ( i.e . day pregnancy test ) . Along endocrinology profile , also record detail treatment outcomes term embryo quality , implantation clinical pregnancy rate . We also intend perform follow-up study pregnancy outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient require IVF treatment eligible study ; even already know Glucose intolerance . Those patient treated condition treatment affect way study , one additional blood test day present down-regulation ultrasound . They require give great amount blood , since vitamin D measurement determine blood drawn routinely estradiol ( E2 ) level . Those patient consent participate study vitamin D level draw visit , require present often otherwise required treating physician . Given intervention one additional blood sample , foresee side-effect risk . Results test impact patient ' IVF treatment protocol , test result disclose treatment end , whether failure pregnancy . Patients ' medical history , result blood test detail IVF treatment protocol enter database , analyze use parametric non-parametric test appropriate , require use SPSS . All blood test level draw analyze McGill Reproductive Center 's laboratory use single immunoassay run . Measuring sample time reduce possibility inter-assay variability , reduce sensitivity study . The sample size experimental patient ( 10 % margin error 95 % confidence limit ) 66 woman control group 200 . These number easily achievable current activity McGill Reproductive Centre .</detailed_description>
