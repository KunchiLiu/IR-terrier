	<brief_title>A Study Ustekinumab ( STELARAÂ® ) Adult Japanese Participants With Severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know identity assign treatment ) , placebo-controlled ( one study medication inactive ) , multicenter , parallel group study ( participant group receive different treatment simultaneously ) . Participants randomly assign 1:1:1 ratio receive either ustekinumab 45 mg , ustekinumab 90 mg , placebo . The study consist screening period , 12-week double-blind treatment period , 12-week follow-up period . During double-blind treatment period , participant receive one subcutaneous injection study medication Week 0 Week 4 . Participants return study center 7 evaluation visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 . Clinical response evaluate Eczema Area Severity Index ( EASI ) , Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA ) , photography , Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) . Participants record itch condition twice daily use participant daily diary 2 week prior randomization Week 12 . Blood sample draw time period screen , double-blind treatment , follow-up period . Participant safety monitor throughout study . Participants permit use concomitant topical medication , define protocol without increase dose , 4 week prior randomization end treatment period . After Week 12 , additional treatment start dose concomitant medication increase , improvement clinical response observe ; case EASI , IGA , photography evaluation stop . The study duration participant expect approximately 30 week . Ustekinumab ( also know STELARA ) antibody medication inhibit inflammatory protein IL-12 IL-23 approve treatment moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis ; study examine whether ustekinumab provide benefit atopic dermatitis ass risk side effect .</detailed_description>
