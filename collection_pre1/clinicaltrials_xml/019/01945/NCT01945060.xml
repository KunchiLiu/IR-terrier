	<brief_title>Closed Loop Control Adolescents Using Heart Rate Exercise Indicator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The artificial pancreas ( AP ) , know Closed-Loop Control blood glucose diabetes , system combine continuous glucose monitor ( glucose sensor ) , control algorithm ( complex mathematical formula ) , insulin pump . The algorithm intend maintain blood glucose level within certain range . This call Control-to-Range . The algorithm intend maintain blood glucose level within certain range . The algorithms run portable AP platform Android smart phone , call Diabetes Assistant ( DiAs ) Medical Platform . In study , researcher hypothesize heart rate inform Control To Range ( hrCTR ) limit risk hypo hyperglycemia immediately exercise adolescent 12 - 17 year age ass hrCTR improve additional measure overall short term glycemic control population . This trial perform Virginia Commonwealth University University Virginia . IRB approval obtain institution .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Criteria document hyperglycemia ( least 1 must meet ) : Fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL confirm Twohour Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL confirm Hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) ≥ 6.5 % document confirmed Random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL symptom No data available time diagnosis participant convince history medical care biochemical parameter consistent T1DM 2 . Criteria require insulin diagnosis ( 1 must meet ) : Participant require insulin diagnosis continually thereafter Participant start insulin diagnosis upon investigator review likely need insulin ( significant hyperglycemia respond oral agent ) eventually require insulin use continually 3 . Criteria Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) ( least 1 must meet ) : Documented low absent Cpeptide level . Documented presence islet cell autoantibody ( ICA ) glutamic acid decarboxylase ( GAD65 ) autoantibody . No data available time diagnosis participant convince history medical care biochemical parameter consistent T1DM In addition , subject meet follow additional criterion : Use insulin pump ( CSII ) treat his/her diabetes least 6 month Actively use bolus calculator current insulin pump predefined parameter carbohydrate ( CHO ) ratio , insulin sensitivity factor ( ISF ) , target glucose Current HbA1c 5.0 % 10.5 % measure DCA2000 equivalent device Not currently know pregnant , breast feeding , intend become pregnant ( female ) Demonstration proper mental status cognition study Willingness avoid consumption acetaminophencontaining product wear continuous glucose monitor sensor . Clinical diagnosis Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) Diabetic ketoacidosis within 6 month prior enrollment Severe hypoglycemia result seizure loss consciousness within 3 month prior enrollment Pregnancy , breast feeding , intention become pregnant Subjects weigh less 40 kg Hematocrit &lt; 36 % ( female ) ; &lt; 38 % ( male ) Conditions may increase risk hypoglycemia know history cerebrovascular event , history arrhythmia , seizure disorder , syncope , adrenal insufficiency , neurologic disease Additional condition may inhibit ability perform exercise ( e.g . injury immobility limb , neuromuscular disease , exerciseinduced asthma require inhaler use within last 12 month clinically impaired pulmonary function ) Use medication significantly lower heart rate ( beta blocker , reserpine , guanethidine , methyldopa , clonidine , cimetidine , digitalis , calcium channel blocker , amiodarone , antiarrythmic drug , lithium ) History systemic deep tissue infection methicillinresistant staph aureus Candida albicans Use device may pose electromagnetic compatibility issue and/or radiofrequency interference continuous glucose monitor ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator , electronic pacemaker , neurostimulator , intrathecal pump , cochlear implant ) Medical condition require use acetaminophencontaining medication withheld study admission . Psychiatric disorder would interfere study task ( e.g . inpatient psychiatric treatment within 6 month prior enrollment , uncontrolled anxiety panic disorder ) Mental incapacity , unwillingness language barrier preclude adequate understanding cooperation Medical condition would make operating continuous glucose monitor , cell phone insulin pump difficult ( e.g . blindness , severe arthritis , immobility ) Any skin condition prevents sensor pump placement abdomen arm ( e.g . bad sunburn , preexist dermatitis , intertrigo , psoriasis , extensive scarring , cellulitis ) Known micro vascular ( diabetic ) complication ( diabetic nonproliferative retinopathy ) , history laser coagulation , proliferative diabetic retinopathy , know diabetic nephropathy ( microalbuminuria normal creatinine ) neuropathy require treatment Active gastroparesis require current medical therapy If antihypertensive , thyroid , lipid lower medication , lack stability medication past 2 month prior enrollment study Known bleed diathesis dyscrasia Allergy medical adhesive , component insulin pump insertion set continuous glucose monitor sensor Anticoagulant therapy aspirin Oral steroid Active enrollment another clinical trial Unwillingness avoid acetaminophen wear continuous glucose monitor sensor . Unwillingness withhold dietary supplement two week prior admission Unwillingness use approve form birth control study sexually active female participant . Subject develop febrile illness within 24 hour inpatient admission .</criteria>
