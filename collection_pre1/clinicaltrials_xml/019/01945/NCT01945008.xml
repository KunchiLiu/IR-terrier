	<brief_summary>HCV infection frequent cause liver chronic disease , cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma western country . To date , standard antiviral treatment , include pegylated interferon ( PEG-IFN ) plus ribavirin ( RBV ) , relatively low effectiveness patient infect genotype 1 4 , associate important adverse side effect , lead treatment interruption approximately 30 % case . The recent association first generation HCV- specific direct-acting antiviral agent ( DAAs ) ( telaprevir boceprevir ) standard treatment result high SVR rate , also patient infect genotype-1 HCV non responder PEG-IFN plus RBV . While several new DAAs development , ultimate goal represent IFN-free regimen , provide great advantage term patient adherence therapy quality life . In context , prospective observational study need evaluate real long-term impact new DAAs clinical practice , term efficacy , safety , cost impact patient quality life . The Italian context Italy European country great number HCV infected people ( average , 3 % population ) , high prevalence center south country , especially old individual , high mortality cause hepatocellular carcinoma . Genotype 1 frequent one ( 50 % infected people ) . DAAs approve end 2012 . For reason , Italy represent interesting context collect data long-term efficacy , safety tolerability new anti-HCV treatment . The PITER cohort study , develop frame Italian Platform study therapy viral hepatitis prospective observational study , base large cohort HCV infect patient 100 clinical center distribute whole national area ( provide list demand ) . The PITER cohort study provide exhaustive information : - Clinical virologic natural history enrol patient - Therapeutic outcome different clinical/virologic context special population start new treatment ( i.e . Predictors virological response , disease progression fibrosis regression - quality life patient - pharmacokinetics drug pharmacological interaction - Short , middle long term side effect - Minimum duration therapy reach sustain virological response - Aspects related personalization treatment specific population : old people , woman , immigrant marginalize population , patient respond standardized treatment protocol , patient wait liver transplantation transplant patient - Role viral variability natural history disease response treatment - Pharmacoeconomics risk-benefits analysis . All information use evaluate prescription appropriateness Italy , important implication public health.. PITER may also represent start point base future clinical study , contribute optimization therapeutic protocol formulation guideline use new therapy HCV treatment</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Collected data include clinical , laboratory anatomopathological information record electronic CRF , enrollment follow-up visit . Special attention devote specific patient category ( HIV , HBV , HDV HEV coinfections , comorbidities , disease patient present sign liver disease progression ) . Subjects start antiviral regimen follow accord specific guideline . A sub-study quality life/adherence treatment/treatment satisfaction also conduct treated patient cohort .</detailed_description>
