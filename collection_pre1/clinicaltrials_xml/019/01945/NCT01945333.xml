	<brief_title>Personalized Scalable Cognitive Remediation Approaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There three phase study . Phase 1 : Development Adaptation . The goal phase adapt currently use computer base CR approach make personalize scalable . We create two CR intervention differ choice pace cognitive exercise . This phase complete . Phase 2 : Open Trial Intervention Refinement . The goal phase obtain quantitative qualitative feedback acceptability usability intervention participant inform refinement assessment treatment package . We recruit ten subject outpatient psychiatric rehabilitation program New York City . After determine study eligibility , individual complete standardize neuropsychological battery schizophrenia assessment , 5-minute Tone Matching Test ass basic auditory processing . Participants randomly assign receive one two intervention package , develop Phase 1 . Each session include 60 minute computer-based learning activity 15 minute therapist-led discussion link computer activity cognition apply daily task recovery goal . Participants complete total 10 session attend 2-3 time weekly 5 week . During session , participant ask keep log software use . At conclusion abbreviate trial , participant participate focus group ask provide verbal feedback enjoyable , engage , useful perceive computer discussion base exercise . Participants ask provide verbal feedback assessment procedure . CR clinicians join research team discus participant ' engagement experience administer Tone Matching Test intervention . Qualitative data summarize participant log focus group consider research team refine assessment battery , treatment parameter , rubric learning exercise . This phase complete . Phase 3 : Pilot Feasibility Trial . People diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder may refer treat clinician may respond post advertisement inquire study participation . After informed study procedure , interested individual ask sign consent form document willingness participate study . Following informed consent , participant ask question demographic characteristic ( e.g . age , education , employment ) , medication psychosocial treatment status , psychiatric symptom symptom severity , complete brief assessment estimate Intelligence . Those Intelligence Quotient ( IQ ) estimate 70 meeting substance dependence criterion time evaluation exit study . In second assessment session , participant complete assessment neuropsychological ability , current functioning , motivation treatment . Participants randomly assign one two treatment condition name `` Brain Basics '' `` Brain Exercises '' . Each treatment condition structure group format 5 participant . Both treatment use commercially available computer-based training software exercise cognitive skill speed processing , attention , work memory , verbal memory . Both condition entail 50 minute computer 10 minute group discussion . In discussion , participant review cognitive activity work help achieve recovery goal . The treatment phase consist 30 separate session 60 minute duration , administer 3 time week course 10-week period .
