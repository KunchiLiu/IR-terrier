	<brief_summary>Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ( PMDD ) characterize affective instability irritability , diagnose 5 % reproductive-age woman . Although cause severe insult patient ' function quality life , ~40 % respond conventional treatment option . In study , investigator aim examine novel therapeutic approach treatment affective instability PMDD : brain-guided training ( i.e.NeuroFeedBack , NF ) probe prefrontal EEG alpha asymmetry . PMDD patient randomly assign either real sham EEG-NF protocol , undergo simultaneous fMRI-EEG scan train period . Comprehensive psychological assessment perform outcome measure . The investigator hypothesize EEG-NF treatment enhance affective stability , thus improve patient ' daily life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurofeedback Treatment Affective Instability Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder ( PMDD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological clinical study consistently show approximately 2-8 % premenopausal woman suffer premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) - serious pattern distress symptom begin luteal phase menstrual cycle terminate shortly onset menses . The common psychological symptom report woman PMDD mood lability irritability , less extent depress mood diminished interest pleasure . In contrast milder premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) , PMDD severe mental disorder case even trigger suicidal thought attempt . Sadly , many woman respond currently available pharmacological treatment , others suffer side effect throughout month . The propose study aim examine clinical effectiveness novel therapeutic approach treat emotional instability PMDD . The investigator plan use clinical model weekly brain-guided training ( i.e . NeuroFeedBack , NF ) gain good self control affect regulation . Feedback base modulate pre-frontal EEG Alpha wave , technique show prior study therapeutic effect affective symptom ; however brain circuitry underlies effect largely unknown . By use simultaneous fMRI EEG investigator intend unveil neural correlate response treatment provide new marker clinical trajectory PMDD . Prospectively diagnosed PMDD woman randomly assign either real sham EEG-NF protocol . During training , patient instruct `` Think Positively '' order actively manipulate brain area related positive experience , view stream various face different expression . Following facial image , feedback base alpha asymmetry score give patient regard ability generate positive thought stream face . However , woman within study group receive accurate feedback . To obtain neural hormonal profile , patient undergo simultaneous EEG-fMRI test training , blood sample hormone level gather . Comprehensive psychiatric psychological assessment perform outcome measure . The investigator hypothesize NF protocol enhance affective stability , thus improve daily function quality life among PMDD patient , without need pharmacological agent , intrusive technique time consume intervention . Moreover , treatment method individually tailor need symptoms patient use periodically rather continuously . The patient remain control throughout procedure , potentially learn use technique continuous basis , beyond scope clinical trial .</detailed_description>
