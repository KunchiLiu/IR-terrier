	<detailed_description>This investigator initiate , single site , open-label , single arm observational study examine initial efficacy tolerability dimethyl fumarate real world clinical setting patient relapse form Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) cross natalizumab therapy . The decision cross natalizumab DMF make patient prescribing physician must precede enrollment study . MS disease status history gather patient 's medical record . Patients follow first 24 week transition natalizumab . Assessments perform Baseline every 4 week thereafter 24 week . These assessment may include : - Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) - Relapse Assessment - Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) include quality life , fatigue , cognition outcome measure - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) - Laboratory test Study drop out due DMF intolerability etiology encourage complete trial even place alternative therapy .</detailed_description>
