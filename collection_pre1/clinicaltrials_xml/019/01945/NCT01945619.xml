	<brief_summary>Subjects type blood cell cancer , blood disease genetic disease receive stem cell transplant . After transplant immune system grow back subject infection one three virus - Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) adenovirus - persist come back despite standard therapy . Adenovirus virus cause symptoms common cold normally cause serious life-threatening infection patient weak immune system . It usually affect lung cause serious pneumonia , also affect gut , liver , pancreas eye . CMV virus also cause serious infection patient suppress immune system . It usually affect lung cause serious pneumonia , also affect intestinal tract , liver eye . Approximately 2/3 normal people harbor virus body . In healthy people CMV rarely cause problem immune system keep control . If subject and/or subject 's donor positive CMV , s/he risk develop CMV disease his/her immune system weak post transplant . EBV virus cause glandular fever kiss disease . It also normally control healthy immune system , immune system weak , cause fever , enlarge lymph node sometimes develop type cancer call lymphoma . This treatment specially trained T cell ( call CTLs ) activity virus cell make transplant donor . However , take 2-3 month make cell , approach practical subject already infection . We want find use CTLs already make another donor match subject his/her donor closely possible CTLs last body activity virus . In recent study cell give 50 patient viral infection post transplant 70 % complete partial response . The purpose study make CTL line leftover previous study available patient viral infection respond standard treatment . These virus-specific CTLs investigational product approve FDA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CTL line make Baylor College Medicine donor transplant patient normal donor National Marrow Donor Program . All donor screen way blood donor . When CTL line make , blood take donor use grow T cell . To , first infect type blood cell call monocyte specially produce adenovirus gene also carry part CMV gene . The monocyte new gene stimulate T cell . This stimulation train T cell kill cell part CMV virus adenovirus . We grow CTLs stimulation EBV infect cell ( make donor blood infect EBV laboratory ) . We also put adenovirus carry CMV gene EBV infect cell CMV adenovirus protein . These EBV infect cell treat radiation grow . By type culture , grow T cell see attack cell infect EBV , adenovirus CMV . Once make sufficient number T cell test make sure kill cell infected virus freeze . The cell thaw injected intravenous line 1-5 minute . All participant study get dose cell . However subject 's infection respond CTLs , s/he may offer 4 dos two-week interval . If infection respond , doctor may also try line different donor .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Prior myeloablative nonmyeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant use either bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell single double umbilical cord blood . 2 . CMV , adenovirus EBV infection persistent despite standard therapy 1 . For CMV infection Patients CMV disease : define demonstration CMV biopsy specimen visceral site ( culture histology ) detection CMV culture direct fluorescent antibody stain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid presence new change pulmonary infiltrates OR Failure antiviral therapy : define continue presence pp65 antigenemia ( &gt; 1+ cell/100,000 cell ) DNAemia ( define reference lab perform PCR assay usually &gt; 400 copies/ml ) least 7 day antiviral therapy OR Relapse antiviral therapy define recurrence either pp65 antigenemia DNAemia least 2 week antiviral therapy For CMV infection , standard therapy define 7 day therapy Ganciclovir , Foscarnet Cidofovir patient disease recurrence 14 day therapy 2 . For EBV infection EBV infection define : Biopsy proven lymphoma EBV genome detect tumor cell immunocytochemistry situ PCR OR Or clinical imaging finding consistent EBV lymphoma elevate EBV viral load peripheral blood . For EBV infection , standard therapy define rituximab give 375mg/m2 patient 14 dos CD20+ve tumor Failure define There increase less 50 % response sit disease EBV lymphoma OR There rise fall le 50 % EBV viral load peripheral blood site disease 3 . For adenovirus infection disease Adenovirus infection define presence adenoviral positivity detect PCR , DAA culture ONE site stool blood urine nasopharynx OR Adenovirus disease define presence adenoviral positivity detect culture two site stool blood urine nasopharynx Standard therapy define 7 day therapy Cidofovir ( renal function permit agent give ) . Failure define rise fall le 50 % viral load peripheral blood site disease measure PCR quantitative assay ) . 3 . Patients multiple CMV , EBV Adenovirus infection eligible give infection persistent despite standard therapy define . Patients multiple infection one persistent infection one control infection eligible enroll . 4 . Clinical status enrollment allow taper steroid le 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone . 5 . Written inform consent and/or sign assent line patient , parent guardian . 1 . Received ATG , Campath immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal antibody within 28 day screen enrollment . 2 . Uncontrolled infection . For bacterial infection , patient must receive definitive therapy sign progress infection 72 hour prior enrollment . For fungal infection patient must receive definitive systemic antifungal therapy sign progress infection 1 week prior enrollment . 3 . Progressing infection define hemodynamic instability attributable sepsis new symptom , worsen physical sign radiographic finding attributable infection . Persisting fever without sign symptom interpret progress infection . 4 . Received donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) within 28 day . 5 . Active acute GVHD grade IIIV . 6 . Active uncontrolled relapse malignancy 7 . Pregnant lactate female patient , applicable ( childbearing potential receive reduced intensity condition regimen ) .</criteria>
