	<brief_title>Pilot Safety Trial Chemotherapy Use Heparin Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial prospective , open-label , single center investigation patient inoperable pancreatic cancer treat first-line chemotherapy outpatient set . The intensified treatment consist gemcitabine 1g/m² ( 30 min ) , 5-flourouracil 750 mg/m² ( 24 h ) , folinic acid 200 mg/m² ( 30 min ) , Cisplatin 30 mg/m² ( 90 min ) day 1 8 ; q3w ) . Beyond initial 3 month intensify chemotherapy patient without cancer progression receive treatment gemcitabine alone prevent patient cumulative toxicity . The concomitant use Enoxaparin start day 1 chemotherapy fix dose 40 mg daily cancer progression . Dose adjustment enoxaparin recommend patient impaired kidney function thrombocytopenia within study accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria guideline minimize bleed risk . Prophylactic antiemetic therapy supportive care provide accord individual symptom demand . The study use sequential design able stop feasibility investigation case severe side effect . After inclusion three consecutive patient hold recruitment arrange three patient receive least 4 week concomitant enoxaparin treatment . In absence serious event recruitment continue minimum 15 patient receive least 12 week concomitant enoxaparin treatment . The trial approve Scientific Research Ethics Committee institution . The investigation conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki Good Clinical Practice Guidelines . Furthermore , national principle proper execution clinical examination drug ( `` Bundesanzeiger '' No . 243 30.12.1987 ) , national regulation German drug law , German drug test guideline adhere .</detailed_description>
