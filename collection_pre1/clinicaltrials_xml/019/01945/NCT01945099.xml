	<brief_summary>`` Closed loop artificial pancreas '' system development control blood sugar live diabetes . These system consist continuous glucose sensor , send signal computer program automatically determine much insulin give . The computer program tell insulin pump deliver insulin . While system test number condition , post-meal blood sugar difficult control . Specifically , look see use hyaluronidase improves ability close loop artificial pancreas well respond meal relate high low .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acceleration Insulin Action Hyaluronidase During Closed-Loop Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To investigate effect rHuPH20 , adjuvant accelerate dispersion absorption subcutaneously inject infused drug , mitigate post-prandial blood glucose excursion inject separately co-formulated insulin closed-loop therapy youth young adult type 1 diabetes . Closed-loop control achieve use external subcutaneous real-time continuous glucose monitoring continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion along computerized algorithm link two process . Specific Aim 1 : To examine whether co-formulation rHuPH20 analog insulin ( INS-PH20 ) , alternately , pre-administration rHuPH20 ( PH20-preRx ) time infusion set placement prior initiation closed-loop ( CL ) insulin delivery reduce peak-postprandial glucose concentration total glucose area curve meal excursion short term inpatient experiment . Specific Aim 2 : To investigate whether accelerated insulin absorption rHuPH20 , deliver described , also result reduction late-post-prandial hyperinsulinemia late post-prandial hypoglycemia CL insulin delivery . Specific Aim 3 : To compare insulin accelerator effect INS-PH20 PH20-preRx , base post prandial glucose excursion closed-loop therapy We hypothesize ; utilization PH20 either separate injection ( PH20-preRx ) co-formulation insulin ( INS-PH20 ) CL therapy reduce peak-postprandial glucose concentration total glucose curve meal excursion compare CL control without intervention , propose use PH20-preRx INS-PH20 well tolerate deliver youth young adult closed-loop setting .</detailed_description>
