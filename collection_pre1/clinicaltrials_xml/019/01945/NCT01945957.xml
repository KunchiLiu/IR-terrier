	<brief_title>Brain Imaging Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize intranasal oxytocin treatment ( OT ) individual autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) : Hypothesis 1a . produce great increase Ventral Tegmental Area ( VTA ) Nucleus Accumbens ( NAc ) activation social reward anticipation compare placebo , provide evidence OT increase activation brain region critical social motivation . ( NICHD funding section/aim- Dr. Joe Piven -U54 HD079124-01 ) Hypothesis 1b . spend proportionally time attend social image screen vs. non-social image compare placebo . Hypothesis 2a . produce differential effect VTA NAc activation social reward anticipation compare oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40 IU dose , provide evidence OT dose-dependently increase activation brain region critical social motivation . Hypothesis 2b . differentially attend social image screen vs. non-social image compare oxytocin 8 IU vs. oxytocin 40 IU dose , provide evidence OT dose-dependently change value social stimulus .</detailed_description>
