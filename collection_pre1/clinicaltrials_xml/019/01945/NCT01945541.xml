	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate recently develop device , measure body composition ( i.e . water content body ) perioperative setting . Specifically investigators test hypothesis , extracellular water content surgery correlate amount intraoperative infusion positive fluid balance . Furthermore investigator test , preoperative evaluation body water help determine intraoperative fluid requirement guide fluid administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Composition Monitoring ( BCM ) Determination Fluid Status Patients Undergoing General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo anesthesia surgery receive intravenous fluid procedure . The amount administer fluid depends type surgery , cardiovascular stability intraoperative loss like hemorrhage . Fluid overload well hypohydration might detrimental might adversely effect outcome surgery . Specifically overhydration result significant weight gain , tissue edema increase morbidity . Technically assisted assessment volume status surgery may useful direct intraoperative fluid administration prevent postoperative volume overload . As prerequisite investigator test recently develop whole-body bioimpedance spectroscopy device determine pre-to postoperative fluid distribution . This body composition monitor ( BCM , Fresenius Medical Care , Germany ) separate extracellular intracellular fluid volume non-invasively applying frequency sweep 3-1000 kilohertz entire patient via electrode place wrist ankle . The investigator test hypothesis 1. amount administer fluid correlate amount overhydration measure postoperatively . 2. preoperative BCM measurement thus information preoperative hydration state might help guide fluidmanagement reduce amount over/ hypohydration postoperatively .</detailed_description>
