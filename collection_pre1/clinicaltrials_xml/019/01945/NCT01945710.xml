	<brief_title>An Open-label , Multicenter , Multiple Dose , Phase 1 Study Establish Maximum Tolerated Dose E7389 Liposomal Formulation Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 first-in-human , non-randomized ( individual assign chance study treatment ) , open-label ( individual know identity study treatment ) , multicenter , 2-part , dose-escalation study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( study body drug ) E7389 LF administer orally patient solid tumor . Each treatment cycle 21 day ( Schedule 1 ) 28 day ( Schedule 1a 2 ) . Part 1 dose-escalation phase , guide pharmacokinetics safety . Three 6 new patient enrol sequential cohort ( first cohort receive start dose subsequent cohort receive increase dos E7389 LF ) . Enrollment cohort stagger ; second third participant every cohort dose first patient cohort complete 2 week Cycle 1 . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe first 2 week Cycle 1 first patient , second third patient cohort initiate treatment . Enrollment first initiate cohort 1 Schedule 1 ( dose Day 1 21 day cycle ) . Interim analysis conduct upon completion cohort . The following decision make base upon result interim analysis 1 ) proceed escalate next dose level ( cohort 2 ) Schedule 1 ( dose Day 1 21 day cycle ) initiate cohort 1 Schedule 2 ( dose Day 1 Day 15 28 day cycle ) , 2 ) discontinue plan evaluate Schedule 2 initiate Schedule 1a ( dose Day 1 28 day cycle ) . After last patient cohort completes Cycle 1 , safety DLT determination evaluate decision make whether escalate dose new cohort 3 6 new patient . Dose escalation halt maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) reach . The total number patient enrol Part 1 depend dose level DLT achieve . After MTD schedule determine , patient enrol Expansion Part study confirm safety tolerability dose schedule . Nine 12 patient treated MTD schedule 6 cycle . The total study duration participant approximately 18 month .</detailed_description>
