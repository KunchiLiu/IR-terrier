	<brief_summary>Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) therapy generally effective treatment center-involved diabetic macular edema ( DME ) , substantial proportion anti-VEGF-treated eye DME achieve vision 20/20 complete resolution retinal thickening . Indeed , 50 % ranibizumab-treated eye achieve 2 line improvement visual acuity baseline 2 year Protocol I , previous DRCR.net ( Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ) study . Furthermore , 27 % ranibizumab-treated eye still central subfield ( CSF ) thickness time-domain optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) ≥ 300 1 year , 40 % ranibizumab-treated eye achieve complete resolution retinal thickening ( &lt; 250 micron ) 2 year . Thus , need alternative additional treatment improve vision reduce retinal edema eye persistent DME follow previous anti-VEGF therapy . Intravitreal steroid efficacious ranibizumab eye DME overall , show positive effect DME eye might add benefit eye already receive anti-VEGF . The main objective study ass short-term effect combination steroid+anti-VEGF therapy visual acuity retinal thickness OCT comparison continue anti-VEGF therapy alone eyes persistent central-involved DME visual acuity impairment despite previous anti-VEGF treatment . This study provide important information design future confirmatory phase III clinical trial efficacy combination steroid anti-VEGF eye persistent DME vision impairment follow previous anti-VEGF therapy . The primary outcome efficacy mean change visual acuity 24 week . Each study eye require complete 12-week run-in phase . The run-in phase identify study eye truly persistent DME despite anti-VEGF therapy require additional 3 injection also collect standardize visual acuity OCT measurement . At enrollment , 4-week 8-week visit run-in phase , enrol eye receive intravitreal injection ranibizumab 3mg . Then 12-week run-in visit , eye still persistent DME , randomize receive either intravitreal sham+intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3 intravitreal dexamethasone+intravitreal ranibizumab 0.3 injection . The randomized study duration 24 week , protocol visit take place every month . The combination injection sham+ranibizumab dexamethasone +ranibizumab give randomization visit ( baseline ) 12-week visit randomization . In , intravitreal injection ranibizumab give study eye 4 , 8 , 16 20 week visit .</brief_summary>

Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : 1 . Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes 2 . Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes 3 . Documented diabetes ADA ( American Diabetes Association ) and/or WHO ( World Health Organization ) criteria 4 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion list . 5 . Fellow eye ( study eye ) meet criterion . 6 . Able willing provide inform consent . Meets follow ocular criterion least one eye : 1 . At least 3 injection antiVEGF drug ( ranibizumab , bevacizumab , aflibercept ) within prior 20 week . 2 . Visual acuity letter score study eye ≤ 78 ≥24 ( approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 20/320 ) . 3 . On clinical exam , definite retinal thickening due DME involve center macula . 4 . OCT CSF thickness , within 8 day enrollment : ) On Zeiss Cirrus ≥ 290 micron woman ; ≥ 305 men ii ) On Heidelberg Spectralis : ≥ 305 micron woman ; ≥ 320 men 5 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , individual cooperation sufficient adequate OCTs . An individual eligible follow exclusion criterion present : 1 . History chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 2 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . 3 . Initiation intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) within 4 month prior randomization plan next 4 month . 4 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day enrollment involved treatment drug receive regulatory approval indication study . Note : study participant receive another investigational drug participate study . 5 . Known allergy component study drug ( include povidone iodine prep ) . 6 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , individual become eligible . 7 . Myocardial infarction , acute cardiac event require hospitalization , stroke , transient ischemic attack , treatment acute congestive heart failure within 1 month prior enrollment . 8 . Systemic steroid , antiVEGF proVEGF treatment within 4 month prior enrollment anticipate use study . These drug use study . 9 . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 9 month . Women potential study participant question potential pregnancy . Investigator judgment use determine pregnancy test need . 10 . Individual expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center next 9 month . The following exclusion apply study eye ( i.e. , may present nonstudy eye unless otherwise specify ) : 1 . Macular edema consider due cause DME . An eye consider eligible : ( 1 ) macular edema consider related ocular surgery cataract extraction ( 2 ) clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface abnormality ( e.g. , taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema . 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity loss would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition , etc. ) . 3 . An ocular condition present ( DME ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc. ) . 4 .
