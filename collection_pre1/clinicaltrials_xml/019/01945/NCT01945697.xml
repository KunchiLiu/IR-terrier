	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate association several methylated gene oral cancer . A prospective case control trial design sample size estimate least 160 case . It expect enroll least 100 subject precancerous lesion oral cancer , ~60 subject normal oral mucosa . This study approve National Taiwan University Hospital Research Ethics Committee . After sign informed consent , subject receive intraoral examination oral epithelial cell collect . If abnormal oral lesion observe , photograph , biopsy perform confirm diagnosis . For methylated gene detection , gDNA extract collected cell standardize assay perform . Clinical sensitivity specificity methylated gene evaluate .</brief_summary>
