	<brief_summary>Cancer worldwide clinical economic problem . Conventional approach treat cancer include surgery , radiotherapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy single modality combine therapy . Recently , target therapy include antibody small molecule inhibitor also demonstrate clinical benefit . It possible study different genetic lesion involve cancer type due advance genomic methodology . The investigational drug study , XL999 inhibit multiple receptor tyrosine kinase , include VEGF receptor ( VEGFR2/KDR ) , platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFRÎ² ) , fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 ( FLT3 ) , fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR1 , FGFR3 ) , RET , KIT , thus , interfere multiple cellular process simultaneously likely effect integrity tumor neovasculature angiogenesis . Together ability induce novel cell cycle arrest , spectrum activity XL999 exhibit may reduce tumor cell proliferation angiogenesis clinic . The rationale purpose maintenance study allow subject receive clinical benefit XL999 continue treatment .</brief_summary>
