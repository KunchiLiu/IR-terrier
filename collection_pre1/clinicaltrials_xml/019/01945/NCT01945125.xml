	<brief_title>Effects THW rhTSH Glomerular Filtration Rate During RIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radioiodine therapy thyroid carcinoma procedure perform six decade , vast literature respect value complementary treatment neoplasia . This procedure also promote reliable follow-up base sequential thyroglobulin dosage make possible reduce disease recurrence rate . One main aspect patient preparation receive radioiodine consist promote stimulation effective uptake radioiodine , obtain either endogenously TSH level elevation post-surgical thyroid hormone withdrawal , exogenously use recombinant human TSH . This last alternative demand suspension thyroid hormone reposition total thyroidectomy . Although fully comprehend , know hypothyroidism result renal function hazard , revert hormonal reposition . It also know renal function modifies radioiodine residence time long time , great patient 's radiation exposure , consequently undesired irradiation healthy tissue organ . So theoretically stimulating patient recombinant human TSH could avoid transient deficient renal function , promote low radioiodine residence time consequently lower radiation exposure therapy . This project aim evaluate effect different stimulation , endogenous exogenous , renal function glomerular filtration rate determine 51Cr-EDTA . This control randomize study 44 patient clinical indication remnant ablative radioiodine treatment prepare either one TSH stimulation procedure . Additionally radiation dosimetry calculus do analyze level patient 's radiation exposure associate uptake stimulation procedure radioiodine therapy .</detailed_description>
