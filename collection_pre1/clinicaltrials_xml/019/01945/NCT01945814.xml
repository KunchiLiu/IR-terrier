	<brief_summary>In study , investigator try see infusion T cell ( call CTLs ) prevent treat cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) adenovirus ( AdV ) reactivation infection . Patients blood cell cancer , blood disease genetic disease may receive stem cell transplant . After receive transplant , risk infection new immune system fight infection grow cord blood cell . In study , investigator try give special cell call T cell . These cell try fight virus cause infection . Investigators test see blood cell donor grow special way , prevent patient get infection . EBV , AdV CMV viruses cause serious life-threatening infection patient weak immune system transplant . T lymphocytes kill viral cell normally enough kill virus infected cell transplant . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person viral infection bone marrow transplant . Some study show positive therapeutic effect patient receive CTLs viral infection post-transplant period . Investigators grow cell donor laboratory way train recognize remove virus T cell give transplant . Since donor previously infect EBV , CMV , adenovirus , investigator able use T cell remember virus grow CTLs . However , also new way grow CTLs donor infect CMV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Viral infection normally control T-cell immunity important cause morbidity mortality period immune recovery hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) .1 Risk infection impact degree tissue mismatch donor recipient immune status donor , include degree length immunosuppression follow transplantation . Reactivation latent virus cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) common often cause symptomatic disease . Respiratory virus adenovirus also frequently cause infection . Antiviral pharmacologic agent effective virus ; use costly , associated significant toxicity outgrowth drug-resistant mutant . As delay recovery virus-specific cellular immune response clearly associate viral reactivation disease patient , cellular immunotherapy restore viral-specific immunity attractive option already successfully use target virus . Multivirus-Specific T Cells To broaden specificity single CTL line include three common viral pathogen stem cell recipient , investigator reactivate CMV adenovirus-specific T cell use mononuclear cell transduce recombinant adenoviral vector encode CMV antigen pp65 ( Ad5f35CMVpp65 ) . Subsequent stimulation EBV-LCL transduce vector reactivate EBV-specific T cell maintain expansion activate adenovirus CMV-specific T cell . This method reliably produce CTLs cytotoxic function specific three virus , investigator infuse 14 stem cell recipient Phase I prophylaxis study . They observe recovery immunity CMV EBV patient increase adenovirus-specific T cell see patient evidence adenovirus infection pre-infusion . A follow-up study frequency adenovirus-specific T cell increase infused CTLs produce similar result , thus highlight importance endogenous antigen promote expansion infuse T cell vivo . Nevertheless , patient clinical trial pre-infusion CMV , adenovirus EBV infection reactivation able clear infection , include one patient severe adenoviral pneumonia require ventilatory support . CTLs recognize multiple antigen therefore produce clinically relevant effect three virus . CTLs HSCT patient virus naïve donor All donor specific T cell strategy discuss far utilized product derive donor seropositive virus interest . With increase use cord blood ( CB ) graft appreciable number patient recipient virus naïve donor graft . CMV reactivation usually occur endogenous virus seropositive recipient seronegative donor remain high risk group develop CMV . The development multivirus specific T cell recipient cord blood graft require prim naïve T-cells rather simple expansion pre-existing memory T-cells seropositive donor . Using protocol stimulate CB-derived T-cells autologous CB-derived dendritic cell EBV-LCL transduce Ad5f35CMVpp65 vector presence IL-7 , 12 15 , multivirus specific T cell prim vitro 20 % fraction cord blood unit . So far , eight patient receive CTL prophylaxis treatment CBT without toxicity . No infusion-related toxicities/GvHD observe despite receive 80 % CB unit , patient engraft neutrophil within 30 day . Early evidence efficacy also demonstrate clearance EBV , CMV adenovirus two patient decrease EBV viral load third 5 patient remain virus free . Therefore , result suggest transfer naïve T cell ( CB ) -derived virus specific T cell patient CBT may safe facilitate long term reconstitution virus-specific T-cells vivo .</detailed_description>
