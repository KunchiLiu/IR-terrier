	<brief_summary>The skin intestinal tract human cover microbe , gene product microbes collectively know human microbiome . Many study recent year link microbiome many aspect human health disease . Premature infant vulnerable invasive infection , may originate microbe colonize skin intestinal tract . Therefore , determine pattern early life colonization source colonization infant may critical determine infectious risk . This prospective study propose identify source microbes colonize extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ; &lt; 1000 g birth weight ) infant immediately follow birth first month life . The study team plan non-invasively survey skin stool ELBW preterm infant combination sample mother ' skin stool intensive care nursery ( ICN ) environment . As control , study team perform similar survey full term mother-infant pair . Samples analyze use high throughput sequence technique determine microbial content . Topical barrier spray emollients commonly use early life ELBW infant reduce insensible water loss enhance integrity skin barrier . The effect treatment development skin microbiome remain unknown . As part study , study team also propose application two different skin barrier therapy small area infant 's legs determine effect different treatment skin colonization . While part study describe summary detailed description , remainder record focus interventional portion study ( Group 2 ) . The goal study outline follow : 1 . To elucidate relationship microbe health care environment colonization pattern intestinal tract preterm term infant . 2 . To understand relationship mode delivery , health care environment , colonization skin preterm term infant . 3 . To determine effect topical skin barrier therapy colonization pattern skin preterm infant . 4 . To ascertain relationship composition microbe colonize preterm term infant development mucosal systemic immunity microbe .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long term goal project understand constitutes protective beneficial gut skin microbial community determine approach foster preserve community . By define gut skin-associated microbiological community community affect environment medical intervention include barrier therapy , study team make essential first-steps towards achieve long term goal . Design &amp; Procedures Study Groups : Potential subject identify among Duke Hospital-admitted woman expectant preterm ( ≤30 week gestation ) term delivery . A total 45 infant enrol one three group . Preterm microbiome Group 1 ( n=10 , ELBW preterm infant ) part intensive survey infant colonization bacteria fungi addition intensive care environment . This strictly observational group . Skin microbiome Group 2 ( n=30 , ELBW preterm infant ) prospectively evaluate development skin microbiome context topical skin therapy typically use study nursery . Each infant serve his/her control well-circumscribed , small area anterior thigh leave untreated control area . Full term microbiome Group 3 ( n=5 , full term infant ) survey skin intestinal colonization serve control group . This strictly observational group . Preterm Full Term One-time Group 4 ( n=100 preterm infant bear &lt; 2000 gram 100 full term ) . This strictly observational group . Comprehensive Microbiome Survey Preterm Infants : Biological environmental sample collect enrol mother infant subject ( Study Group 1 ) time delivery first two week life . For stool sample , minimum 1 gram collect . For blood sample , 4 ml collect . Infant stool sample collect diaper . Maternal stool vaginal sample collect time caesarian section use sterile nylon swab distal rectum vagina . Skin sample collect gentle rub target area sterile nylon swab moisten sterile saline . Breast milk sample scavenge leave material feed infant . Since breast milk undergoes single thaw frozen storage per feeding , excess milk may store subsequent feeding would put waste . A portion stool , blood , breast milk sample place sterile , nucleic acid-free tube . An additional portion stool , blood , breast milk sample place sterile , nucleic acid-free tube contain preservative RNA later . All stool , breast milk , blood sample freeze -20°C within 1 hour collection . Remaining sample place 4°C within 18 hr collection . Samples transfer -80°C storage within 24 hour collection . A label carry unique sample number place sample collect . A binder sample label log sample number , time collection , sample type key , special note regard collection , place bedside . It standard care ELBW infant Duke Intensive Care Nursery non-sterile glove worn provider family member contact infant first two week life . Providers relatives ask place use glove zip-lock bag bedside contact infant . The glove group zip-lock bag provider type ( medical provider , nurse , ancillary staff ) relative . The bag collect shift day . Glove sample label link individual provider relative . When available , scavenge serum use assessment antibody specificity relationship colonization pattern infant . In case , stool sample analyze presence , quantity specificity mucosal immunoglobulins . A video recorder position incubator tripod attach incubator vertical rail capture change infant 's environment , include medical nursing intervention . The camera position capture infant inside incubator surroundings , avoid face interact infant preserve anonymity . When hand instrument place inside incubator , record . Video download onto external hard drive every 24 hour , onto secure computer server analysis . Video record continuous two week except period time take change memory card . The video cod start stop time clinical care event order explore influence environmental change diversity infant 's microbiome use Mangold Interact software . Inter-rater reliability check video coder score 30-minute period video , compute Cohen 's kappa . Microbiome Survey Full Term Infants : The study team perform limit survey five full term infant control group ( Study Group 3 ) . Samples collect mother infant . Samples collect daily mother infant hospital , generally expect approximately three day . At hospital discharge , parent send home supply prepay return mail envelope use collect skin stool sample infant reach two week life . Skin Microbiome Substudy Plan : A control study commonly use skin treatment ( No Sting protective spray treatment ) perform 30 ELBW infant ( Study Group 2 ) determine No Sting promotes different skin microbial colonization . The current standard skin care ELBW infant Duke ICN application No Sting external expose , non-mucosal area shortly birth one week age . A quarter 1.5 x 3 inch silicon patch two hole apply infant 's thigh . One hole patch leave untreated ( control ) treat No Sting . The patch use define treatment treatment area . The remainder infant 's skin treat No Sting therapy birth seven day life , per current standard care . Daily sample site ( No Sting , untreated ) perform gentle application nylon swab first two week life , twice weekly one month age . Samples analyze microbial content . Additional sample include infant stool well maternal skin , vaginal , perirectal , stool sample outline Table 1 . The study team use non-invasive skin probe perform daily assessment transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) skin pH . TEWL measure use DermaLab® TEWL probe ( Cortex Technology , Hadsund , Dermark ) , consist open probe pair sensor place different distance skin . Humidity temperature measure sensor calculate vapor pressure gradient . The difference two vapor pressure gradient measure representative TEWL point skin [ 19 , 20 ] . Environmental humidity level also measure use DermaLab® obtain TEWL measure . The average humidity reading two sensor record environmental humidity . The probe thoroughly clean 70 % ethanol prior us minimize cross-contamination microbial transmission . The ethanol allow air dry prior use probe . The Extech PH100 meter use measure skin pH range 0.00 14.00 . The small flat surface electrode provide non-intrusive accurate measure pH . No Sting reapplied day seven . Preterm Full Term One-time Microbiome Survey ( Study Group 4 ) : One hundred preterm infant bear &lt; 2000 gram 100 full term infant include one-time data collection infant microbiome sample . For premature infant environmental sample also collect . The procedure describe Study Group 1 2 use single data collection .</detailed_description>
