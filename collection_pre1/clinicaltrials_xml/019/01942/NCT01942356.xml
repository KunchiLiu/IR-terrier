	<detailed_description>Recent effort focus development new software system able directly titrate anesthesia base activity brain ( EEG ) feedback mechanism . Brain activity use measure effect anesthetic medication ( anesthetic `` depth '' ) , vary person person despite give amount medication . There potential new system considerably improve anesthetic control use method able adapt constant input brain activity . The purpose study compare close -loop intravenous anesthetic ( TIVA ) use BIS ( Bispectral Index ) feedback loop controller base reinforcement learn titrate dose TIVA manually control standard volatile anesthetic agent titrate anesthesiologist . Propofol frequently apply hypnotic-anesthetic IV drug anesthesia . In `` open-loop '' control propofol administration anesthesia , initial dose guideline base typical subject , without take account large inter-individual variability . To manage variability , clinician start give standard dose , observe therapeutic effect adapt dose regimen . Although , `` open-loop '' drug administration clinically `` standard-of-care '' , efficiency decision process highly depend expertise clinician , time consume might result suboptimal therapy . The study use patient acute cholecystitis schedule laparoscopic cholecystectomy surgery inclusion/exclusion criterion describe appropriate section . Potential subject identify prior surgery base meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion . The subject approach inpatient unit pre-operative hold area , private area curtain draw maintain privacy . This place patient routinely examine consented prior surgery.. The subject inform participation lack participation study influence treatment way . The subject inform give consent participation study may withdraw consent time performance study . This withdrawal consent may give investigator oral write form . The Investigator explain study potential subject verbally , provide pertinent information ( purpose , procedure , risk , benefit , alternative participation , etc . ) , allow potential subject ample opportunity ask question . Following verbal explanation , potential subject provide write consent form give least one hour consider whether participate research . After allow potential subject time read consent form , Investigator list consent form meet potential subject answer additional question she/he may . The subject pre randomize study arm ( Permuted block randomisation via computer generate number ) inform study arm . The three study arm RL-TIVA ( experimental ) , Manual TIVA , INH-Sevo . Premedication Induction : Premedication 0.05mg/kg IV midazolam Prior arrival operating room , peripheral intravenous line insert large forearm vein patient 500 ml saline infuse . This required administer drug fluid anesthesia routinely do patient . On arrival operating room , vital sign ( heart rate , non-invasive blood pressure , blood oxygen saturation end-tidal CO2 ) measure patient ( standard care anesthesia ) . The RL-TIVA group also non-traumatic , commercially available unilateral BIS electrode apply patient 's forehead . This EEG sensor connect BIS ( Covidien , Mansfield , MA , USA ) monitor calculate BIS . All patient undergo standard IV induction use : 1mg/kg 1 % lidocaine maximum 100mg 100mcg fentanyl 2mg/kg propofol maximum 200mg 0.6mg/kg rocuronium Patients randomly allocate standard volatile base anesthesia BIS-guided intravenous anesthesia administration . The protocol study arm follow : -RL-TIVA : Propofol , ketamine sufentanil ( PKS ) administration do via three way stop cock connect directly IV catheter minimize dead space volume . PKS solution contain total 50ml . Propofol 10mg/ml , Ketamine 1mg/ml ( omit subsequent preparation first 50ml ) , Sufentanil 0.25 mcg-ml . Drug administer use Harvard 33 syringe pump ( The Harvard 33 Syringe pump use human trial prior study Stanford pending publication ) . This pump connect via RS 232 interface study computer run RL ( reinforcement learn ) control software . This software platform collect real time vital sign BIS value steer target control infusion pump closed-loop controller . Baseline vital sign , include BIS record 2 minute . During induction 5 minute intubation , NIBP measure every minute . Thereafter , NIBP measure least every 3 minute end case . The start baseline measure consider `` START CASE '' moment . IV anesthetic administration start use closed-loop system set BIS target 45 . When require , optimization patient ' positioning , disinfection drape ensue . When ready , surgery start . During surgery , anesthesia maintain propofol-ketamine-sufentanil via closed-loop BIS target 45 . - Manual TIVA : Manually titrate IV anesthetic routinely do operating room alternative inhalational anesthetic . Propofol , ketamine sufentanil ( PKS ) administration do via three way stop cock connect directly IV catheter minimize dead space volume . PKS solution contain total 50ml . Propofol 10mg/ml , Ketamine 1mg/ml ( omit subsequent preparation first 50ml ) , Sufentanil 0.25 mcg-ml . Drug administer use Alaris infusion pump titrate anesthesiologist base blood pressure heart-rate traditionally do standard care intravenous anesthetic . - INH-Sevo : After patient intubate Sevoflurane start titrate 0.8 1.5 MAC anesthesiologist . At end surgery , define placement surgical dressing , volatile anesthetic discontinue . Wake protocol three arm . Normocapnia maintain recovery mechanical ventilation till spontaneous breathing resume . No decrease Minute Ventilation allow recovery . Moment return spontaneous breathing record . Once spontaneous breathing return , patient ask name open mouth . A positive response record trachea extubated . Thereafter , patient transfer PACU . The parameter list appropriate section evaluate . Data Collection : Subject data keep 3 specific location . A hard copy print maintain folder contain eligibility criterion , consent form , source document . This stored lock file cabinet limit access PI Co-Investigators . The electronic data store encrypted flash drive keep lock file cabinet back secure encrypt Network folder PI Co-Investigators authorization access . Statistical Analysis : A power analysis previously report Stanford human volunteer study data perform order estimate appropriate sample size . To estimate `` worst-case '' condition , measure parameter demonstrate great variation , MDPE , select . Assuming comparison two-sample , two-tailed t-test p-value 0.05 , single-group sample size 25 produce statistical power value ~1.0 . Given size , detect 10 % difference MDPE standard deviation 7 still maintain power value &gt; 0.85 ; thus , select n=25 three study group , yield total sample size 75 . We acknowledge sample size might prove over-powered ; however , intraoperative study know challenging . For example , measure variable expect demonstrate normal distribution ( critical assumption power analysis ) , anticipate limited occurrence confound influence , protocol deviation interruption data collection . Given vagary intraoperative study , choose sample size 75 patient seem reasonable . Descriptive statistic Categorical data : , sex , age , weight , height , induction time , time accurate control ( time reach target , overshoot BIS ) , % time accurate control hemodynamic stability , recovery time , nausea , vomit , sedation score , pain score , drug concentration . Closed-loop control performance data ( see ) . Continuous variable : BIS , heart rate , blood pressure , saturation , EtCO2 Univariate analysis , Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U-test use use compare numerical data performance parameter . Chi-squared use analyse qualitative data . RMANOVA use analyze continuous data . Safety : An anesthesiologist resident present entire duration anesthetic standard care . If time hardware software failure , infusion disconnect conventional volatile anesthetic rapidly institute . LIMITS OF THE CLOSED-LOOP ( safety ) : In closed-loop control software , safety limit instal . Procedure Analysis Interpretation Safety Data : The monitoring entity Benjamin Wallisch , MD . He oversee research participant 's safety , monitor unanticipated problem involve risk participant others , assure event report IRB . Integrity appropriate handling ( confidentiality ) follow data monitor : Demographic morphometrics data , vital sign , bispectral ( BIS ) index value , infusion pump flow rate , record occurrence severity drug side effect . Monitoring occur every study patient enrol . Should unexpected adverse event occur . All effort make identify source cause event . Source identification may mandate temporary halting study well protocol adjustment ( e.g . reduction drug dos ) . Serious adverse event report Benjamin Wallisch , MD within 2 business day . Serious adverse event bring attention IRB within 24 hour . Deviations study protocol adverse event address IRB protocol . A log keep Adverse event Protocol Deviation keep encrypted flash drive back encrypted network drive . The reporting event state . An annual progress report submit IRB review .</detailed_description>
