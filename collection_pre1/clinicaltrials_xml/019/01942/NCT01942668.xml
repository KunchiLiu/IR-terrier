	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Combination Estradiol Progesterone Treat Vasomotor Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postmenopausal subject intact uterus meet study entry criterion randomize one five treatment arm ( four active one placebo ) follow 12 month . During Screening period subject provide diary self-assess frequency severity vasomotor symptom . Subjects experience minimum daily frequency ≥7 ( ≥50 per week ) moderate severe hot flush participate VMS Substudy first 12 week treatment . The Substudy subject stratify treatment arm within site , Substudy subject possibility randomize placebo . Subjects qualify study except experience minimum daily frequency ≥7 ( ≥50 per week ) moderate severe hot flush stratify within site one four active treatment arm follow 12 month , participate VMS Substudy . ( However , VMS information collect subject first 12 week treatment . ) All Study Subjects : Postmenopausal woman intact uterus seek relief hot flush meet inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible 12 month study treatment . VMS Substudy Subjects : A subset All Study Subjects ≥7 per day ≥50 per week moderate severe hot flush ( determined Screening ) eligible 12-week VMS Substudy total 12 month study treatment . Clinical evaluation perform follow time point : - Screening Period ( Week : - 8.5 ) ( -60 Days ) - Visit 1 Randomization ( Week 0 ) ( Day 1 ) - Visit 2 Interim ( Week 4 ) - Visit 3 Interim ( Week 8 ) - Visit 4 Interim ( Week 12 ) - Visit 5 Interim ( Month 6 ) - Visit 6 Interim ( Month 9 ) - Visit 7 End Treatment ( Month 12 )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Be female age 40 65 year ( time randomization ) willing participate study , document signing informed consent form . 2 . Be postmenopausal woman intact uterus Screening serum estradiol level ≤50 pg/mL . Postmenopausal define herein : 1 . ≥ 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea , 2. least 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea Screening serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/ml , 3 . ≥ 6 week postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy . 3 . Be seek treatment relief vasomotor symptom associate menopause . 4 . To participate VMS Substudy , subject must also report ≥7 moderate severe hot flush per day , ≥50 per week , baseline assessment Screening ( subject whose hot flush less frequent may still participate nonSubstudy subject . Note : A minimum 14 consecutive day complete hot flush diary data require baseline assessment Screening , consecutive day must occur within last 14 day prior Randomization visit ( count Randomization visit day ) . The recent 7 consecutive day data prior randomization ( Day 7 Day 1 ) use determine baseline number mild , moderate severe hot flush subject . 5 . Have Body Mass Index ( BMI ) less equal 34 kg/mP2P .

Be judge principal subinvestigator physician otherwise generally good health base medical evaluation perform Screening period prior initial dose study medication . The medical evaluation finding must include : 1. normal nonclinically significant physical examination , include vital sign ( sit blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate temperature ) . Sitting systolic blood pressure ≤140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg Screening . A subject may take two antihypertensive medication . 2. normal nonclinically significant pelvic examination . 3. mammogram show sign significant disease ( perform within previous 6 month prior initial dose study medication ) . Subjects must BIRADS 1 2 enroll study . An incomplete mammogram result , i.e . BIRADS 0 , acceptable .
