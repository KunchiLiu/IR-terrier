	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call enzalutamide metastatatic castration resistant prostate cancer.Enzalutamide already FDA approve metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer treatment chemotherapy . The purpose study analyze feature tumor specimen sample prior therapy disease progression determine patient respond stop responding treatment Enzalutamide . Prior chemotherapy requirement trial . Enzalutamide drug design block effect male hormone body may help prostate cancer grow . It already approve FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) patient castration-resistant prostate cancer receive prior chemotherapy . Additionally , study analyze feature tumor specimen sample prior therapy disease progression determine patient respond stop responding treatment enzalutamide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Enzalutamide Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer With Correlative Assessment Androgen Receptor Signaling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm patient able participate study . - The patient first two required prostate biopsy prior start study treatment . - The patient give prescription study drug study drug-dosing diary treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) , time patient take study drug daily . The diary also include special instruction take study drug . The study drug ( enzalutatmide ) take orally ( mouth ) home . On Day 1 cycle ( +/- 4 day ) , follow procedure perform clinic : - A medical history . - A Physical examination - Performance status - Blood test ( 2-3 tablespoon ) . - The patient ask medication currently take , include over-the counter medication , herbal remedy , vitamin , supplement . - The patient ask disease-related symptom experience . - The patient receive new supply medication diary review . Every 12 week ( +/-1 week ) following procedure perform clinic : - Blood test . A small sample patient 's blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) collect . This blood collect specialized laboratory test . - A ( CT ) scan patient 's chest CT MRI scan abdomen , pelvis bone scan perform every 12 week ( +/- 1 week ) patient active treatment . If baseline CT patient 's chest show disease , investigator may ask repeat . End Study Visit clinic : - A medical history . - A physical examination - Performance status - Blood test ( 2-3 tablespoon ) - The patient ask disease-related symptom If patient complete least 4 cycle enzalutamide , patient undergo second two required biopsy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Be male ≥ 18 year age . Participants must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without ≥50 % neuroendocrine differentiation small cell histology . Participants must progressive disease define either : Castrate resistant disease define PCWG . [ 26 ] Participants must rise PSA two successive determination least one week apart PSA level ≥ 2 ng/ml ( screen PSA need ≥ 2 ng/ml ) testosterone level &lt; 50 ng/dL , OR Soft tissue progression define RECIST 1.1 , OR Bone disease progression define PCWG2 two new lesion bone scan . CRPC metastatic disease least one site metastatic disease must amenable needle biopsy . Soft tissue biopsy site include : lymph node visceral metastasis . Bone sit include lumbar vertebra , pelvic bone long bone . Excluded site thoracic , cervical vertebra , skull rib lesion . Biopsy site select guidance interventional radiologist determine best site optimize balance obtain useful tissue analysis minimize risk . Participants without orchiectomy must maintain LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy . Participants may number previous hormonal therapy ( antiandrogens , steroid , estrogen , finasteride , dutasteride , ketoconazole , abiraterone ) provide discontinue ≥ 4 week enrollment . Participants may two previous cytotoxic therapeutic regimen provide discontinue ≥ 4 week enrollment . At least 4 week interval previous prostate cancer treatment LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy bisphosphonates enrollment . Participants receive bisphosphonates therapy maintain therapy . If participant start bisphosphonates , recommend start treatment first biopsy . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % , see Appendix A ) .
