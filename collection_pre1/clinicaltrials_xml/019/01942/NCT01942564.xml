	<brief_summary>After head injury , many people find exposure light cause increase discomfort . By measure pupil eye constricts flash red blue light , study investigate whether phenomenon due change eye 's sensitivity light .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Head Injury-associated Photosensitivity Pupillary Function ( HIPP ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pupil inside eye constrict response light stimulation . Different class cell within human retina initiate response . Recent research suggest one ganglion cell type involve pupil response also play role photophobia experience migraine sufferer . The main aim study determine whether type ganglion cell become 'hypersensitive ' traumatic brain injury , thereby contribute symptom increase photosensitivity experience many individual . In first session study , subject ask question sensitivity light reaction eye ' pupil flash red blue light measure . The subject give full eye examination rule cause increase photosensitivity . In case , subject ask attend second session roughly two week later . They ask wear watch measure daily activity/sleep rhythm light exposure inter-session period . During second session , test pupil response blue red flickering light perform .</detailed_description>
