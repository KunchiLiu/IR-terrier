	<brief_summary>Endovascular treatment first line treatment management intracranial aneurysm . However aneurysm recanalization important limitation treatment . Several factor seem associate aneurysm recanalization include medical history patient , aneurysm status ( rupture unruptured ) , aneurysm size location , modality treatment , immediate post-operative occlusion aneurysm . A precise knowledge factor increase risk aneurysm recanalization quite important optimize strategy treatment reduce recanalization rate . No large , prospective , multicenter trial deal question publish literature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors Intracranial Aneurysm Recanalization After Endovascular Treatment .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence intracranial aneurysms high ( 2 3 % ) . The major risk intracranial aneurysm rupture lead intracranial bleeding ( subarachnoid , parenchymal and/or intraventricular ) associate mortality morbidity . Endovascular treatment first line treatment rupture unruptured aneurysm . One major limitation treatment aneurysm recanalization observe approximately 20 % aneurysms leading retreatment approximately 10 % aneurysm . CARAT trial show risk rebleeding aneurysm coil significantly associate quality aneurysm occlusion . The risk rebleeding 1.1 % case complete occlusion , 2.9 % aneurysm occlusion 91 99 % , 5.9 % aneurysm occlusion 70 et 90 % , 17.6 % aneurysm occlusion le 70 % . However outlined study clearly analyze relation recanalization rebleeding . Several factor probably associate aneurysm recanalization . Ruptured aneurysm prone aneurysm recanalization unruptured aneurysm . Age , elevate blood pressure , smoking probably play role aneurysm recanalization . Anatomical feature also probably key factor aneurysm recanalization . Aneurysm neck size probably important factor aneurysm recanalization . The role aneurysm location controversial . Therapeutic factor certainly play also important role , precise analysis still miss . The quality post-operative aneurysm occlusion probably important future evolution aneurysm . Surface-modified coil demonstrate efficacy prevent aneurysm recanalization . The role adjunctive technique also precisely evaluate ( remodel , stenting ) .</detailed_description>
