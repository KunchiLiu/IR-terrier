	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common condition affect rhythm heart cause irregular often rapid heartbeat . Developing condition may cause significant health problem symptoms affect normal day-to-day activity . Patients AF also shorter life expectancy average . Tablets use try normalise heart rhythm rarely work well . As result , doctor devise treatment try cure condition . Special wire ( call catheter ) use deliver heat energy ( call ablation ) inside surface heart . This technique use recent year patient troublesome symptom due AF . The aim treatment draw line ablation specific place heart . Unfortunately , lot patient ( almost 50 % ) get AF treatment patient second treatment perform . It usually find second treatment gap develop line ablation draw first time around . The investigator think electively second treatment close gap couple month first treatment may mean few patient get AF future . The investigator also want find factor make line ablation less likely develop gap . In study , participant assign one two group : 1. `` standard care '' group , single treatment initially . 2. `` repeat study '' group , initial treatment follow second treatment 8-10 week later . For patient `` repeat study group '' , investigator see many develop gap since first treatment . The investigator look gap compare information collect first treatment try work gap develop . Any gaps find second treatment close . All participant monitor carefully 12 month see many group get AF . To , participant give handheld heart rhythm monitor keep end study . This device simple use . Participants ask make 30 second record heart rhythm day also whenever symptom . These recording download review appointment arrange 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month initial ablation procedure .</brief_summary>
