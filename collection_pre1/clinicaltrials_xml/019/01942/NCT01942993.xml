	<brief_summary>Approximately 40-60 % cutaneous melanoma select mutation protein call BRAF part signal pathway call Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . When BRAF mutate MAPK pathway remain active allow melanoma grow . Vemurafenib oral treatment block activity BRAF lead decrease activity MAPK pathway . When patient melanoma express specific mutation BRAF treat vemurafenib approximately 50 % develop response treatment shrinkage tumor . When compare standard chemotherapy call dacarbazine use treat melanoma , treatment vemurafenib lead statistically significant overall survival living long benefit . Because survival benefit vemurafenib Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment metastatic melanoma express BRAF mutation call V600E BRAF . There increase evidence immune system also important affect melanoma growth survival immune treatment FDA approve treatment metastatic melanoma . There limited evidence block BRAF vemurafenib may affect activity component immune system . It important well characterize understand effect vemurafenib treatment various component immune system . The purpose study systematically evaluate effect vemurafenib treatment ( FDA approve dose regimen ) part immune system call innate adaptive immune system . The hypothesis vemurafenib treatment affect immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Treatment With Vemurafenib Immune System Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 40-60 % cutaneous melanoma select mutation BRAF protein part signal pathway call Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase ( MAPK ) pathway . Over 90 % mutation BRAF occur position V600 common V600E mutation . Mutation position V600 BRAF activate MAPK pathway facilitate melanoma proliferation growth . The response rate treatment vemurafenib patient stage IV melanoma express V600E BRAF mutation approximately 50 % . A phase III study compare first line treatment vemurafenib compare standard dacarbazine chemotherapy demonstrate statistically significant overall survival benefit patient population . Based survival benefit vemurafenib FDA approve treatment stage IV melanoma express V600E BRAF mutation . Vemurafenib administer dose 960 milligram orally twice daily . While target BRAF lead survival benefit patient melanoma express BRAF mutation become increasingly apparent immune system important modulating growth melanoma . As immune therapy FDA approve treatment stage IV melanoma include ipilimumab confers overall survival benefit activate immune system inhibition CTLA-4 protein express certain T-cells . Little known exposure different class immune cell vemurafenib modulates activity immune system . We know many melanoma express differentiation antigen could potentially recognize immune system . This recognition could potentially utilized development novel immunotherapeutic treatment approach . The pharmacologic inhibition MAPK pathway lead increase expression various melanoma differentiation antigens along improve recognition antigen-specific T-lymphocytes . Evaluation limit number tumor biopsy specimens suggest infiltration melanoma CD4+ CD8+ T-lymphocytes markedly increase follow treatment BRAF inhibitor . Furthermore viability function ( determine use assay cytokine release assay cytotoxic activity ) T-lymphocytes negatively affected exposure vemurafenib concentration know cause anti-tumor effect . The MAPK pathway pathway utilize many cell type include immune cell cell tumor microenvironment . As vemurafenib could potentially modulate activity MAPK pathway melanoma cell , immune cell , component tumor microenvironment . Effects vemurafenib tumor cell may directly lead change antigen presentation effect innate adaptive immune system could potentially alter recognition tumor cell modulate positively negatively immune recognition antitumor activity . Therefore , good understand immune modulation induce anti-BRAF therapy provide data model develop rational fashion therapy combine BRAF target immune modulatory agent potentially use agent ipilimumab anti-PD1 anti-PDL1 antibody .</detailed_description>
