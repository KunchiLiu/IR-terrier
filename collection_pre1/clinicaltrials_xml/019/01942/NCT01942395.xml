	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine dietary change affect heart blood vessel patient hypertension ( high blod pressure ) condition call 'heart failure preserve ejection fraction '' ( HFPEF ) . This condition also know `` diastolic heart failure '' `` heart failure normal ejection fraction '' , occur even though heart 's pump function normal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension 'Diastolic ' Heart Failure 2 ( DASH-DHF 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In early study , investigator find patient HFPEF eat special diet three week improve blood pressure control low level blood chemical may damage heart blood vessel . The eating plan study base DASH diet , also know Dietary Approaches Stop Hypertension diet . This plan rich fruit , vegetable , low-fat dairy , recommend decrease blood pressure patient hypertension . Current medical guideline also recommend patient hypertension heart failure decrease dietary salt intake . The diet patient eat study DASH/sodium-restricted ( DASH/SRD ) diet well control diet base average report diet collect use Food Frequency Questionnaires pilot study . Patients randomize one diet three week crossover diet three week . Patients ask eat DASH/sodium-restricted diet home dietary support additional eight week . In study , main goal confirm finding earlier study . The investigator would also like understand DASH/SRD change function heart blood vessel exercise activity gene could involve HFPEF .</detailed_description>
