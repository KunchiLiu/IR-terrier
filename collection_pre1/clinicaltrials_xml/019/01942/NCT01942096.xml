	<brief_summary>High school elite train program today development several 'elite sport school ' Belgium , order select train future elite athlete already young age . Little known effect sustain train potential development asthma adolescent lung growth . It would great importance able select individual risk develop exercise-induced asthma , already start enrollment 'elite sport school . This would allow physician follow lung function parameter closely regularly ; , necessary , start treatment early first sign exercise-induced asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Airway Inflammation Relation Exercise Elite Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Competitive swimmer , competitive indoor athlete control individual perform sport recreational level recruit study . They perform sport-specific training ( swimmer control : swim 90 minute , indoor athlete : basketball volleyball 90 minute ) Baseline measurement : - Airway inflammation upper low airway assess collection nasal fluid ( nasal sponge insert nostril 5 minute ) , Fraction exhale Nitric Oxide measurement sputum induction . - Upper low airway symptom assess questionnaire ( SinoNasal Outcome Measure-22 , Visual Analogue Score , Asthma Symptom Score Juniper Score ) - Allergy assess skin prick test ( skin ) immunocap test ( blood , 1 tube 10 ml ) . - Lung function nasal patency measure spirometry Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow measurement . - Exercise induced bronchoconstriction assess eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation test . Measurements immediately train : - Collection nasal fluid - Assessment upper airway symptom ( Visual Analogue Score ) - Spirometry Fraction Exhaled Nitric Oxide measurement - Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow measurement Measurements 24 hour training : - Collection nasal fluid - Assessment upper airway symptom ( Visual Analogue Score ) - Spirometry Fraction Exhaled Nitric Oxide measurement - Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow measurement - Sputum induction - Venous puncture ( 1 tube 10 ml )</detailed_description>
