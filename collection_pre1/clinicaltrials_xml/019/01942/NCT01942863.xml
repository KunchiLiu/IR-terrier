	<brief_summary>Enteroscopy , include double balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) , single balloon enteroscopy ( SBE ) spiral enteroscopy ( SE ) currently , show good performance small bowel diagnostics seem useful clinical routine . However , enteroscopy time-consuming procedure . During common practice , large volume air need insufflate good visualization . It lead significant distention small bowel examination , make intubation technically challenge formation distend bowel loop acute angulation limit maximal intubation length . According publish data , oral insertion depth different kind enteroscopy limit approximately 240 cm . The total examination rate range form 18 % 86 % DBE 0 % 11 % SBE . It think intubation depth small bowel determines diagnostic yield follow treatment . The deep enteroscopy advance small bowel , lesion may find treat . In order improve intubation depth balloon enteroscopy , several method , carbon dioxide insufflation decompression side tube-equipped device , try show positive effect . CO2 insufflation could also reduce severe pain DBE residual gas retention procedure rapid absorption . However , know much CO2 insufflation decrease distention small bowel formation bowel loop . Recently , use water infusion lieu air insufflation show facilitate completion colonoscopy , even potentially difficult patient prior abdominal pelvic surgery . Water exchange method obviate excessive lengthen colon formation acute angulation , may cause less pain easy intubation scope insertion . Recently , water exchange method also try two patient undergoing SBE via antegrade route center . Distal ileum 8cm near ICV cecum reach respectively ( unpublished data ) , indicate water exchange useful method deep intubation SBE . Here prospective , randomize , control trial design investigate whether , compare CO2 insufflation method , water exchange method could increase intubation depth diagnostic yield patient undergoing SBE .</brief_summary>
