	<brief_summary>Our recent trial combine local radiotherapy intratumoral administration TLR agonists - refer 'in situ vaccination ' - patient low-grade lymphoma demonstrate safety , induction anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses partial complete remission patient ' non-irradiated site disease complete remission last month three year . This iteration situ vaccine approach build prior work way improve efficacy , add Flt3L change toll-like receptor ( TLR ) agonist poly-ICLC -an optimal TLR agonist type dendritic cell ( DC ) recruit Flt3L . The vaccine thus 3 phase : 1. intratumoral Flt3L administration recruit DC tumor 2. low-dose radiotherapy release tumor antigens 3. intratumoral poly-ICLC administration activate tumor-antigen load DC</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Situ Vaccine Low-Grade Lymphoma : Combination Intratumoral Flt3L Poly-ICLC With Low-Dose Radiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphomas comprise 5th common cancer U.S. approximately 80,000 new case diagnose U.S. year . Low-grade B-cell lymphoma prevalent subtype amongst consider incurable standard therapy . Chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy induce temporary remission , though disease generally recur , become progressively resistant therapy ultimately therapy-resistant . Standard therapies prolong survival , though standard care regard initiate therapy ( versus observation ) optimal sequence different therapy . Novel therapy need distinct mechanism great tolerability profile . Immunotherapy long precedent able cure low-grade lymphoma allogeneic transplant curative proportion chemo-refractory patient , though morbidity procedure reduce broad utilization . Previously , complete four trial combine local radiotherapy ( standard care disease ) intratumoral administration TLR agonists - approach refer 'in situ vaccination ' patient previously untreated relapsed/refractory low-grade lymphoma . We demonstrate safety , induction anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses partial complete remission patient ' non-irradiated site disease.1 , 2 The recent trial compare previously untreated versus relapsed/refractory patient receive therapy observe superior response former group , presumably due immunosuppressive effect prior treatment latter group . The situ vaccine premise pre-clinical data show approach superior systemic TLR agonist delivery3 clinical result reproduce find ; situ vaccination yield superior response rate compare trial systemic TLR agonist therapy lymphoma.4 This iteration situ vaccine approach build prior work way improve efficacy , make two change prior approach : 1. intratumoral administration rhuFlt3L/CDX-301 recruit dendritic cell tumor site 2. intratumoral administration poly-ICLC . Flt3L safely administer patient lymphoma5 -pre-clinically- show induce tumor leukocyte infiltration regression lymphoma tumors.6 , 7 A total 36 healthy volunteer 294 cancer patient treat include industry-sponsored study prior formulation agent ( AMG 949 ) excellent tolerability 30 healthy volunteer recently treat current formulation ( CDX-301 ) , excellent tolerability . Poly-ICLC safely administer patient lymphoma8 -pre-clinically- show induce natural killer ( NK ) cell cytolytic activity regression lymphoma tumors.9-11 Over 600 healthy volunteer cancer patient 17 trial treat comparable dos poly-ICLC use excellent tolerability .</detailed_description>
