	<brief_summary>Acute post-operative pain cause discomfort patient , delay recovery increase morbidity circulatory system , respiratory system , immune system , pain control one important objectives peri-operative patient management . Patient control analgesia ( PCA ) piece equipment patient personally control administration analgesic . It generally use postoperative pain management method heighten patient satisfaction reduce complication obtain appropriate level pain relief . Usually , design administer analgesic steady speed , patient administer additional medication press button pain severe . Here , prevent complication excessive administration analgesic , repeat administration allow within certain time interval . The PCA equipment categorize electronic physical accord force operate drug injection pump . Electronic equipment use electrical energy apply vermicular movement fluid tube administer analgesic . Physical equipment disposable equipment design fill elastomer reservoir bag expand material , elasticity return original length use administer analgesic . The physical equipment easy carry movement comfortable need additional electronic equipment device . There also need special training operate equipment , action mechanism simple less opportunity malfunction . The disposable physical equipment account approximately 70 % domestic market share prefer electronic equipment . On hand , contrary electronic equipment , physical PCA equipment disadvantage provide information regard history equipment 's use . The early physical PCA equipment simple function continually administer medication set speed . Hence , sufficient function 'patient control ' pain control equipment . Then , function additional administration button add patient personally decide whether administer additional amount analgesic . At time , physical PCA equipment improve prevent excessive administration set lock-out time safety measure . The following development Accufuser Selectuss® , function add select administration speed three option . In way , physical PCA equipment continue evolve direction enhance safety , convenience , clinical effectiveness . The advantage pain control use PCA equipment patient personally control additional administration analgesic press button . In case exist import product , design administer bolus press button , pressure press PVC bag fill medication button administer bolus . Compared intravenous route , use epidural PCA administration route superior analgesic effect , reduce amount opioid analgesic administer . On hand , disadvantage pas narrow long epidural catheter deliver medication epidural space relatively high resistance . Woo Young Medical experiment product Accufuser plus® ( Woo Young Medical , Korea ) , result show time take empty bolus bag approximately 40-80 second depend dosage . The pressure person press bolus button PCA equipment repeatedly measure obtain mean value , pressure constantly maintain machine measure time take empty bolus bag . Clinically , easy continually press button 40-80 second , difficult exclude possibility bolus administer properly . In addition , excessive pressure apply , possibility bolus bag may burst . The domestically developed product Accufuser Omnibus® ( Woo Young Medical , Korea ) develop purpose supplement bolus failure occur use epidural PCA . Within bolus module , second elastomeric balloon instal behind first bolus bag patient press bolus button long time . Therefore , research focus effectiveness safety domestic product Accufuser Omnibus® ( Woo Young Medical , Korea ) regard whether bolus sufficiently deliver administered epidural route , compare result comparative clinical trial import physical PCA equipment ( Infusor SV® , Baxter , USA ) .</brief_summary>
