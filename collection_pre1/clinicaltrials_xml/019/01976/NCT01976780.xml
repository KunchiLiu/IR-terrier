	<brief_summary>This study aim assess degree artemisinin resistance adult pediatric subject present uncomplicated falciparum malaria Western Kenya . The study treatments Artemether Lumefantrine ( AL ) Artesunate Mefloquine ( ASMQ ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vivo In Vitro Efficacy Artemisinin Combination Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data generate study provide snapshot current situation regard P. falciparum sensitivity ACTs Western Kenya . By subject one study arm receive artesunate partner drug completion artemisinin phase enable accurate evaluation artemisinin derivative without confound influence partner drug . Sequential administration component ACT drug recognize WHO one way ACTs administer . There close follow-up subject throughout duration study , , subject fail respond adequately receive prompt rescue treatment . Since largely expect subject Western Kenya satisfactory response ACTs , data study provide baseline information regard parasite characteristic compare data Thailand , area report resistance ACTs . This , turn , potentially enable identification key marker , host parasite , may assist early detection resistance , also well understand development resistance ACTs . As , data generate study , compare pool data similar study conduct Peru Thailand , potentially inform local international policy regard ACT use treatment uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria .</detailed_description>
