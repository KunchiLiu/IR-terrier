	<brief_summary>Background : - The human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) cause acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . Combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) drug treat HIV infection . They generally decrease amount HIV virus blood ( call viral load ) low level . This happen drug still fight HIV take every day exactly prescribe . When take direct , ART drug strong enough , virus become resistant , ART work control virus . Researchers want know control HIV people low viral load current ART drug . Objective : - &lt; TAB &gt; To better control HIV people get low viral load even ART drug learn HIV control . Eligibility : - People least 14 year old HIV . - People least two combination ART drug ( include current ART ) . - People whose last two viral load great 1,000 copies/mL . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Participants baseline visit . They another physical exam , blood test , plus answer question know HIV ART , take ART . - Participants arrange stay NIH hospital 7 8 day . - They take medication usual . At time take ART drug , ask nurse bring . If forget , nurse bring . - Participants meet doctor , pharmacist , social worker nurse discus way help participant remember take drug . - Participants blood draw every day . - Researchers study test result . Some participant put different ART drug . If happens , participant another NIH hospital stay 7-8 day . - Participants 4 follow-up visit 12 week , every 3 month 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study People With HIV Infection Who Have High Viral Loads Despite Combination Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically improve survival individual human immunodeficiency virus type1 ( HIV-1 ) infection . Despite recent development potent regimens few toxicity low pill burden , remain subpopulation subject fail achieve maintain viral suppression treatment . Factors know contribute virologic failure include suboptimal adherence , drug resistance , suboptimal regimen potency , sequential introduction single drug fail regimen , reduce ART exposure due impaired drug absorption pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction . This natural history protocol intensive observation intend characterize manage HIV-infected subject document virologic failure current regimen experience virologic failure meet one follow criterion : - Documented virologic failure least 1 prior ART regimen least 2 consecutive HIV RNA plasma measurement &gt; 1,000 copies/mL , include last documented value , current prescribed ART regimen least 6 month ; - Documented extensive resistance least 3 ARV drug class , persistent plasma viremia ( HIV RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL &gt; 6 month ) despite multiple regimen change , regardless long subject prescribe current regimen . We anticipate , large proportion subject enrol protocol , nonadherence , without drug resistance , common reason virologic failure . Another objective study assess impact 7-day , inpatient , selfguided directly observe therapy ( DOT ) HIV RNA kinetics , subject receive pre-enrollment ART regimen . During DOT period , subject request antiretroviral drug pre-arranged time reflect home medication schedule . Failure record medication provide nursing staff . Adherence psychosocial assessment also perform . Plasma concentration least one antiretroviral drug regimen measure first last day DOT determine suboptimal drug plasma concentration contribute factor virologic failure . Within approximately 2 week , later 4 week , DOT ( post-DOT phase ) , research team review result HIV-1 viral load kinetics , current cumulative genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance test , ART history response , identify factor could contribute treatment failure ( concomitant medication , history antiretroviral AEs , psychosocial barrier ) . The team design new , individualized treatment plan subject . Subjects either continue pre-enrollment ART regimen , receive new , individually tailor regimen . Only FDA-approved therapeutic agent offer protocol . Subjects may co-enrolled experimental protocol optimal management HIV disease , one available eligibility criterion meet . New regimen monitor second 7-day , inpatient , self-guided DOT . Subjects follow DOT week 2 ( plus/minus 3 working day ) , 4 ( plus/minus 3 working day ) , 8 ( plus/minus 7 day ) , 12 ( plus/minus 7 day ) , every 3 month ( plus/minus 2 week ) 2 year , option extend participation longer necessary . The treatment plan may repeat subject fails respond new regimen . In select group subject fail achieve viral suppression , advance HIV-1 variant analysis may use attempt identify presence minority drug resistant variant . This analysis use supplemental information construct new regimen group subject . Samples plasma , serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell store evaluation virologic evolution factor may contribute treatment failure population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age , great equal 14 year . 2 . Documented HIV1 infection ( prior write documentation positive standard ELISA rapid HIV1/HIV2 antibody test confirmatory Western Blot , documentation repeat HIV RNA great 1,000 copies/mL ) .. 3 . Established care HIV primary care provider . 4 . Fulfilling one follow criterion virologic failure : 1 . Documented virologic failure least 1 prior ART regimen least 2 consecutive HIV RNA plasma measurement great 1,000 copies/mL , include last documented value , current prescribed ART regimen least 6 month ; 2 . Documented extensive resistance least 3 ARV drug class , persistent plasma viremia ( HIV RNA great 1,000 copies/mL great 6 month ) despite multiple regimen change , regardless long subject prescribe current regimen . 5 . Willingness sample store future research . 6 . Willingness undergo genetic testing . 7 . Ability willingness provide inform consent hospitalize inpatient DOT . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . HIV RNA level screen &lt; 1,000 copies/mL . 2 . Receiving medical care acute medical illness stem significant comorbidity ; enrollment may defer postponed condition resolve stabilizes . 3 . Pregnancy ( subject become pregnant enrol protocol , continue participation throughout pregnancy ) . 4 . Any illness condition , investigator opinion , may substantially increase risk associate subject participation study , may compromise scientific objective .</criteria>
