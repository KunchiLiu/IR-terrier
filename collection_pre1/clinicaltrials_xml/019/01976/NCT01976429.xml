	<brief_summary>This study determine newly develop standard test Eustachian tube function identify person ear pain ( barotrauma ) develop middle-ear inflammation and/or fluid ( barotitis ) expose rapid change air pressure , example , airplane flight scuba dive . Up 150 adult child ( 10-50 year old ) fly dive least 1-2 time experience ear pain develop middle-ear fluid activity approximately 60 adult child fly dive experience problem undergo Eustachian tube function test simulated flight diving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit experience symptom present sign interpretable Eustachian ( ET ) dysfunction ( ETD ) expose rapid change ambient pressure , example , flight airplane ( absence concurrent cold/active nasal allergy ) free tank dive . In general , subject present physician condition diagnose poor ET function ( ETF ) base solely symptom/sign presentation . However , know identify person experience symptoms/signs future time goal study prevent presentation susceptible individual . To calibrate test protocol , 20 subjects/age range 10-19 , 20-29 30-50 year ( total=60 control subject ) good health , fly and/or dive frequently report ear-related problem ascent descent , recruit . One hundred fifty symptomatic subject general good health age 10 50 year low age limit choose assure good communication subject investigator , also recruit . These control subject intact tympanic membrane since subject non-intact tympanic membrane experience barotrauma maintain ambient middle-ear ( ME ) pressure throughout flight . A general history focus specific symptomatic complaint maneuver perform attempt relieve otologic symptom airplane flight/diving take , ear , nose throat ( ENT ) exam , include tympanometry , do confirm intact tympanic membrane disease-free ME nasal exam do rule concurrent nasal inflammation . Then , sonotubometry , 9-step test , tubomanometry `` sniffing '' , Valsalva Toynbee maneuver do establish baseline ETF . If patulous ( observation synchronize breathe tympanic membrane movement ) physically obstruct ET ( inability transfer gas ET normal driving pressure ) suggest result test , subject dismiss ETF test refer ENT physician ETD clinic Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh want pursue complete workup evaluate underlying cause condition possible treatment option . Those able continue ET stress test . Briefly , presence/absence ET opening swallow assessed sonotubometry step decrease 2500 daPa ( ref . ambient ) local ambient determine relative efficiency muscle-assisted ET opening . The high applied pressure ET open outcome variable . If individual completes apply pressure sequence without experience problem open ET swallow maneuver typically use him/her open ET , subject simulate flight/dive relevant expect exposure . Flight Simulation : The standard flight simulation parameter base Boeing 747 modify simulate , include personal , aircraft . For simulation , assume airport sea level , maximum cabin pressurization equal atmospheric pressure 7000 foot ascent/descent rate 350 ft/min ( cabin altitude ) . With subject seat comfortably pressure-chamber , chamber pressure decrease ambient ambient minus 2280 daPa ( gauge pressure=-2280 daPa ) 15 minute period , maintain ambient-2280 daPa 15 minute ( cruise ) increase ambient 15 minute period . The subject report symptom throughout middle-ear pressure measure bilaterally tympanometry periodically . Diving Simulation : The standard dive simulation assume sea level ambient pressure , avoid possibility bend , limit simulated maximum depth 20 foot maximum `` dive '' duration 1 hour . We make first assumption diver rapidly descend 5 foot point attempt equalize ME-ambient pressure proceed maximum depth 20 foot within 5 minute ( These parameter modify depend diver 's experience chamber pressure increase simulate dive 30 foot ) . We also assume return surface approximately 10 foot per minute . With subject seat comfortably chamber , pressure increase 1500 daPa+ambient ( gauge pressure =1500 daPa , approximately depth 5 foot ) , subject middle-ear pressure measure tympanometry symptoms/signs evaluate . If assessment normal , chamber pressure increase 6100 daPa+ambient ( approximate depth 20 foot sea fresh water ) , maintain pressure 20 minute decrease ambient ( ascent surface ) . The rate change depth set 5 ft/minute . The subject report symptom throughout middle-ear pressure measure bilaterally tympanometry periodically . The simulation interrupt first report inability `` clear '' ear swallow maneuver typically use purpose . At pressure , subject attempt equalize ME-chamber pressure swallowing , unsuccessful , attempt open ET use Valsalva maneuver , jaw movements/rotations voluntary yawning . If maneuver unsuccessful , instrumented nasopharyngeal overpressures use `` ear popper '' ® Otovent® device try . If successful , simulation continue , else chamber pressure reduce atmospheric ME pressure equalize ambient pressure . Then , subject enter symptomatic subject , video-nasoendoscopic exam nasopharynx perform diagnose nasal nasopharyngeal pathology physical obstruction ET orifice . All subject symptomatic group pas simulation without symptoms/signs barotrauma retested use appropriate simulation second day confirm `` symptom-free '' flights/dives . For subject fail test and/or complete simulation without otologic symptoms/signs , refer physician ETD clinic want pursue work-up treatment . We expect control subject successfully complete test protocol simulation majority subject report flight/diving relate symptom fail step ETF test able complete simulation without symptoms/signs ME barotrauma . The sensitivity , specificity accuracy ET stress test simple ETF test do baseline respect predict failed/successful simulation calculate .</detailed_description>
