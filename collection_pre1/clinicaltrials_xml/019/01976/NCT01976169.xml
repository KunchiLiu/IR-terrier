	<brief_summary>Standard care : Treatment Trastuzumab Experimental : 21-Day Cycle Combination therapy T-DM1 intravenously Day 1 oral PD-0332991 Days 5-18 Study Design Methodology : This phase 1B inter-patient dose escalation study PD-0332991 combination T-DM1 patient recurrent metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer prior trastuzumab HER2-directed therapy . The subject administer T-DM1 intravenous infusion 3.6 mg/kg 90 minute day 1 21 day cycle . Infusion timing may vary 30-90 minute depend well subject tolerates treatment . A standard 3+3 trial design use PD-0332991 dose escalation cohorts.The dose PD-0332991 divide 3 cohort , subject receive PD-0332991 day 5-18 21 day cycle . Cohort 1 : PD-0332991 - 100 mg daily ( oral ) Cohort 2 : PD-0332991 - 150 mg daily ( oral ) Cohort 3 : PD-0332991 - 200 mg daily ( oral ) The 3+3 design entail one patient first three patient DLT , three additional patient enter dose level Treatment cycle continue disease progression withdrawal study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 1B inter-patient dose escalation study PD-0332991 combination T -- DM1 patient recurrent metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer prior trastuzumab HER2-directed therapy . A standard 3+3 trial design use PD-0332991 dose escalation cohort . The 3+3 design entail one patient first three patient dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , three additional patient enter dose level . The PD-0332991 dose level start 100 mg po daily ; second cohort receive 150mg po daily ; third cohort 200mg po daily . Patients receive PD-0332991 day 5-18 21 day cycle . T-DM1 give intravenously 3.6 mg/kg day 1 21 day cycle . Toxicity assess use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 grade scale . Dose- limit toxicity-DLT defined drug-related grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity grade 4 hematologic toxicity last &gt; 28 day last day therapy . If two patient experience drug-related DLT , maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination HER2-positive breast cancer patient exceed , enrollment dose stop , next low dose designate MTD . An additional 15 patient treat MTD maximal 200mg po daily PD-0332991 dose combination T-DM1 confirm safety . Treatment cycle continue disease progression withdrawal study . Study End-points : 1 . To evaluate ass Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) . 2 . To determine toxicity profile . 3 . To determine clinical response rate . 4 . To determine duration response . 5 . To evaluate baseline HER2 positivity biomarkers analyze pretreatment tumor Ki67 , phospho-RB , cleave caspase 3 , phospho-histone H3 , cycline E , MCM7 , HER2 , p27Kip1 . 6 . To evaluate post-treatment Ki67 , phospho-RB , cleave caspase 3 , phospho-histone H3 , cyclin E , MCM7 , HER2 , p27Kip1 , Rb , p16ink4c , CDK4 , CDK6 order establish biomarker response treatment . 7 . To evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters PD-0332991 T-DM1 include Cmax , AUC , t1/2</detailed_description>
