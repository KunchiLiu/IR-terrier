	<brief_summary>This global , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study use avatrombopag treat adult thrombocytopenia associate liver disease . The study evaluate avatrombopag treatment thrombocytopenia associate liver disease prior elective procedure reduce need platelet transfusion rescue procedure bleed due procedural post-procedural bleeding complication . Participants enrol 2 cohort accord mean baseline platelet count , within baseline platelet count cohort stratify risk bleeding associate elective procedure ( low , moderate , high ) hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) status ( Yes No ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Participants great equal 18 year age Screening chronic liver disease 2 . Participants mean baseline platelet count le 50 x 10^9/L . Platelet count must measure 2 separate occasion , Screening Period Baseline , must perform least one day apart neither platelet count great 60 x 10^9/L . The mean 2 platelet count ( mean baseline platelet count ) use entry criterion assignment low high baseline platelet count cohort . 3 . Participants schedule undergo permit elective procedure , opinion investigator , require platelet transfusion address risk bleeding associate procedure unless clinically significant change platelet count baseline 4 . Model For Endstage Liver Disease ( MELD ) score less equal 24 Screening 5 . If take inhibitor P glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , except verapamil , dose must stable 7 day prior Screening 6 . Provide write informed consent 7 . Willing able comply aspect protocol Exclusion Criteria 1 . Any history arterial venous thrombosis , include partial complete thrombosis 2 . Evidence thrombosis ( partial complete ) main portal vein , portal vein branch , part splenic mesenteric system Screening 3 . Adequate portal vein blood flow Screening 4 . Hepatic encephalopathy effectively treat 5 . Participants HCC Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) stag classification C D 6 . Platelet transfusion receipt blood product contain platelet within 7 day Screening . However pack red blood cell permit . 7 . Heparin , warfarin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , aspirin , verapamil , antiplatelet therapy ticlopidine glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist ( eg , tirofiban ) within 7 day Screening 8 . Use erythropoietin stimulating agent within 7 day Screening 9 . Interferon ( IFN ) use within 14 day Screening 10 . Estrogencontaining hormonal contraceptive hormone replacement therapy use within 30 day Screening 11 . Active infection require systemic antibiotic therapy within 7 day Screening . However , prophylactic use antibiotic permit . 12 .

Elective procedure perform prior Visit 4 ( Procedure Day ) 14 . Known human immunodeficiency virus positive 15 . Any clinically significant acute active bleeding ( eg , gastrointestinal , central nervous system ) 16 . Known history primary hematologic disorder ( eg , immune thrombocytopenic purpura , myelodysplastic syndrome ) 17 . Known medical history genetic prothrombotic syndrome ( eg , Factor V Leiden ; prothrombin G20210A ; ATIII deficiency etc . ) 18 . Participants history significant cardiovascular disease ( eg , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Grade III/IV , arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event [ eg , atrial fibrillation ] , coronary artery stent placement , angioplasty , coronary artery bypass graft ) 19 . Females childbearing potential unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day study entry agree use highly effective method contraception ( eg , total abstinence , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method [ condom plus diaphragm spermicide ] , progesteroneonly contraceptive implant/injection , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) throughout entire study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . If currently abstinent , participant must agree use doublebarrier method describe becomes sexually active study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( least 12 month consecutive amenorrhea appropriate age group without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy ) least 1 month dosing . 20 .
