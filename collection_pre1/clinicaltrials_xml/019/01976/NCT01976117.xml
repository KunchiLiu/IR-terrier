	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : A commercial e-nose ( Cyranose 320 ) able detect specific breathprints patient COPD bacterial infection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E-nose Utility Diagnosis Bacterial Infection COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty 50 % COPD patient airway colonization potentially pathogenic bacteria . This associated bad prognosis . Currently , diagnosis bacterial colonization relies mainly upon quantitative sputum culture . However , method lack good sensitivity . The electronic nose novel device make nanosensors capable detect specific volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) . OBJECTIVES : Main 1 ) To assess usefulness electronic nose diagnosis bacterial colonization COPD . Secondary 1 ) To define VOCs pattern associate bacterial colonization . 2 ) To study pattern pulmonary systemic inflammation associate bacterial colonization well relationship aforementioned VOCs pattern .</detailed_description>
