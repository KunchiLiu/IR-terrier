	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate major adverse bleeding risk , thromboembolic event rate post radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation . The primary goal establish safety dabigatran use peri-procedural anti-coagulation leave atrial catheter radiofrequency ablation , cryoablation procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Dabigatran Etexilate Prevent Stroke Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design Approximately 100 patient plan pulmonary vein isolation antral radiofrequency cryoablation paroxysmal persistent atrial fibrillation , leave atrial flutter follow prior leave atrial ablation procedure , CHADS2 score 0-6 CHADS2-VASc score 0-9 eligible trial enrol . A transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) perform pre-procedure base present cardiac rhythm day plan catheter ablation , stroke risk CHADS2 CHADS2-VASc score , precede use therapeutic anti-coagulation ( per current 2012 HRS/ACC/ESC guideline atrial fibrillation management ) . Immediately follow ablation procedure ( 4-6 hour sheath pull vascular hemostasis ) , dabigatran etexilate 150mg bid , 75mg twice daily base creatinine clearance Use Specified Populations ( USPI ) , administer minimum 3 month post RF ablation . This represent standard blank period post atrial fibrillation leave atrial flutter catheter ablation anticoagulation therapy . After 3 month blank period , patient may safely take dabigatran low risk group stroke thromboembolism , accord investigator discretion ( CHADS 2 score 0-1 , CHADS2-VASc score 0-1 ) . If dabigatran etexilate pre-procedure , drug hold least 24 hour intervention depend renal function patient ( per recommendation USPI ) . If possible , discontinue dabigatran 1 2 day ( CrCl &gt; 50 mL/min ) 3 5 day ( CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min ) invasive surgical procedure , due increase risk bleeding . Dabigatran etexilate resume 4-6 hour sheath pull vascular hemostasis post ablation . Intra-procedure intravenous heparin drip start leave atrial access obtain ACT goal target 300-350 second weight base nomogram . Standardized ablation endpoint ( 4 vein entrance exit block post ablation adenosine challenge and/or isoproterenol , termination leave atrial flutter completion linear ablation confirm differential pacing ) document , along radiofrequency cryoablation delivery time , fluoroscopy total case time . Inpatient adverse event document , outpatient follow occur 1 3 month post ablation per standard protocol , documentation composite endpoint ( see ) . In addition , 30 day post study phone call follow perform ( 30 day +/- 4 day follow 3 month visit ) . Please see Table 1 schedule event . Our hypothesis exposure dabigatran set AF leave atrial catheter ablation associate alow acceptable risk major adverse bleeding risk , low thromboembolic event rate post RF ablation , accordance previous data , contrary finding Lakireddy , et al , retrospective study publish 2012 JACC . This could lead widespread utilization dabigatran etexilate center perform high number atrial fibrillation leave atrial flutter ablation procedure .</detailed_description>
