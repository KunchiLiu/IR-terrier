	<brief_summary>The primary objective demonstrate safety tolerability switch patient Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) oral dopamine agonist rotigotine . As secondary objective , investigator evaluate control RLS symptom rotigotine compare prior oral regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switching From Oral Dopamine Agonists Rotigotine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 in-person visit 4 schedule telephone appointment course approximately 6 week . The first visit screen visit eligibility confirm informed consent obtain . After first visit , subject continue current oral dopamine agonist one-week baseline period record RLS symptom daily . The second visit baseline visit . The IRLS scale , commonly use measure RLS symptom , obtain . An individualized schedule down-titration oral dopamine agonist concomitant up-titration rotigotine provide . After second visit , subject begin cross-titration . This entail pre-determined incremental taper oral medication flexible up-titration rotigotine accord symptom . During time , subject keep diary RLS symptom speak investigator phone total 3 time ( visit 2a-2c ) discus dose rotigotine . After titration complete , subject enter maintenance period , last 28 day . There another phone contact ( 2d ) one week titration complete adjust dose rotigotine need . The subject continue choose dose next 3 week maintenance period . There one final phone contact ( 2e ) 1 week prior end maintenance period remind subject resume RLS symptom diary final week maintenance period . The third final visit take place end maintenance period . RLS symptom discuss IRLS scale , Clinician Global Impression Change ( CGIC ) , Patient Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) , Preference Medication Scale ( POMS ) administer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis RLS , define International Restless Legs Study Group ( IRLS ) essential criterion : 1 . An urge move leg , usually accompany cause uncomfortable unpleasant sensation legs . 2 . The urge move unpleasant sensation begin worsen period rest inactivity lie sit . 3 . The urge move unpleasant sensation partially totally relieved movement , walk stretch , least long activity continue . 4 . The urge move unpleasant sensation worse even night day occur even night . ( Although subject may meet criterion current oral regimen , symptom must present prior treatment . ) Current treatment either pramipexole ( ≤1 mg total daily dose ) ropinirole ( ≤4 mg total daily dose ) unchanged dose past 30 day . Patients also RLS medication allow participate dosing stable past 30 day subject agree maintain stable dose duration trial . Inadequate symptom control patient dissatisfaction current oral regimen . Able speak read English . Able provide inform consent . Able learn demonstrate appropriate patch application . Returns appropriately complete RLS symptom log Visit 2 . Confirms understand crosstitration schedule able restate summarize instruction Visit 2 . Age ≥18 ≤75 . BMI ≥18 ≤35 History and/or clinical record document change medication active central nervous system ( antidepressant , analgesic , antipsychotic , antiepileptic , hypnotic , etc . ) least 30 day prior visit 1 . Able understand study procedures agree remain stable medication period study . Women childbearing potential must agree use medically accept method birth control . Acceptable form birth control include : 1 . Condom + spermicide b. Diaphragm + spermicide c. Oral contraceptive pill , hormone implant ( like Norplant ) , injection ( like DepoProvera ) Intrauterine Device Known secondary cause RLS , include endstage renal disease , severe iron deficiency ( ferritin &lt; 18 ) , pregnancy . History frequent symptomatic orthostatic hypotension . Current treatment dopamine antagonist medication . Another chronic pain syndrome would , opinion investigator , interfere evaluation RLS symptom response study medication . Plan undergo procedure may require short longterm opiates pain control course trial . Women pregnant , lactating , plan become pregnant . Shift work commitment allow regular sleep night . Known hypersensitivity intolerance rotigotine . Known allergy sulfitecontaining drug . History problematic skin hypersensitivity adhesive . Previous current clinically significant impulse control disorder , determine clinical interview . Anticipated change psychiatric neurologic status likely require adjustment CNSactive medication study period . Unwillingness subject remain stable dos CNSactive medication . Unwillingness subject refrain asneeded use RLS medication . Significant risk suicide clinical interview . History severe mental illness psychosis Current unstable medical illness . Any medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , would interfere participation study .</criteria>
