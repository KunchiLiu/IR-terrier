	<brief_summary>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) fourth common malignancy Taiwan . It account 5.8 % cancer cause 2,463 death per year . Aberrant glycosylation hallmark human cancer , include HNSCC , affect many cellular property . This study aim explore role mucin glycosylating enzyme HNSCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mucin Glycosylating Enzymes Head Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glycosylation common post-translational modification protein . Aberrant glycosylation hallmark human cancer affect many cellular property , include cell proliferation , apoptosis , differentiation , transformation , migration immune response . Though widely explore various human cancer , role mucin glycosylating enzyme HNSCC elucidate . Our aim analyze expression pattern mucin glycosylating enzyme HNSCC tissue . Furthermore , correlate expression level mucin glycosylating enzymes clinical characteristic HNSCC patient .</detailed_description>
