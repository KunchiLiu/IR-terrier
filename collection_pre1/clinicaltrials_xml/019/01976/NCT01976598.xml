	<detailed_description>Chronic pain remain serious public health problem , result approximately 100 million chronic pain patient U.S. alone [ 1 ] . While numerous treatment exist , none completely address issue . In particular , spinal cord stimulation ( SCS ) become establish technique treat patient chronic neuropathic pain [ 2 ] . The conventional paradigm SCS treatment attempt mask pain substitute pain sensation paresthesia [ 3 ] ; however , new study show possible gain excellent pain relief without concomitant paresthesia ( `` sub-threshold stimulation '' ) use different stimulation parameter [ 4 ] [ 5 ] . Because paresthesia-free programming paradigm still new , best place stimulation best program parameter use still unclear , make difficult place lead surgical implantation program patient afterwards . Additionally , sub-threshold stimulation provide immediate pain relief , may take several hour even day feel relief , make simple programming session hour insufficient determine optimal stimulation placement . While difference conventional SCS make program difficult initially , study new stimulation paradigm , especially differences optimal stimulation location time course pain relief , may also provide insight mechanism action sub-threshold stimulation . This protocol aim study optimal stimulation parameter location SCS use sub-threshold stimulation .</detailed_description>
