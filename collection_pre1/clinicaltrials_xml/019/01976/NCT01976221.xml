	<brief_title>Priority Setting Waiting Time Decision Referral Process , How Whom ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : A prospective cluster control randomize study . The intervention multifaceted group train program GPs priority set wait time indication use national prioritization guideline . The comprehensiveness appropriateness referral score registered trained hospital consultant . Three hospital division receive referral choose registration : dermatology , urology orthopedics . The referral rate follow group . Method : 280 GPs South Rogaland organize 58 continuous professional development ( CPD ) group 5-10 participant invite participate . The group cluster randomize control intervention group . The intervention train program priority set wait time decision use national priority guideline . Hospital consultant read assess referral select record data referral . Referring physician 's priority ( P1 ) recommend wait time ( W1 ) hospital doctor ' priority ( P2 ) wait time examination treatment hospital ( W2 ) record well comprehensiveness referral ( symptom , severity , prognosis , expect outcome ) . We look correlation comprehensiveness presence priority set wait time referral . The degree inter-rater correlation refer GP hospital consultant use measure mutual understand actual health problem need specialist care basis information referral . The referral rate group register intervention . Participants : All GPs refer Stavanger University Hospital participate one 58 CPD group South Rogaland County agree participate study include . The CPD group cluster randomize intervention control group . Information priority set wait time 1000 consecutive referral record hospital consultant represent three division : dermatology , urology orthopedics . Intervention : The intervention team-based multifaceted case-based interactive training program priority set wait time decision use national priority guideline . Each participant receive write information national guideline benefit use , , hospital consultant patient . Training take place CPD group normally meet . The participant study prepared case realistic patient problem examples different referral evaluate scored accord priority waiting time , trained priority set indication wait time consistent national guideline . Actual diagnose clinical problem prostate cancer , malignant melanoma coxarthrosis . The training take approximately 2 hour . There follow-up e-mail telephone support project leader support use priority setting . Effect variable : The main effect variable use priority set wait time referral . Other effect variable inter-rater agreement GPs hospital consultant priority set wait time indication referral referral rate hospital . Sample size statistic : We base sample size calculation simple comparison post intervention mean referral quality intervention arm control arm . All calculation 80 % power alpha-level 0.05 , relate standardized difference . All result plot obtain use R. In study fix CPD group average size 8 associate GPs . We plan invite group south county , mean maximum number group 58 . The total number referral register score high increase study period . The correlation observation within CPD group reduce power study , thus number observation require inflated factor related intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . Some recent study report ICC antibiotic prescribe habit CPD group ; Flottorp et al ( 2002 ) find ICC=0.085 , whereas Gjelstad et al find 0.013 0.061 ( 2013 ) . We anticipate quality referral may even correlate antibiotic prescription ( least GP level ) , thus allow ICCs 0.05 0.15 . Following Hemming et al ( 2011 ) , find give number CPD group , limit difference possible detect , even infinite number observation per group . Thus , likely able detect `` small '' difference ( standardized difference 0.2 small Cohen 's definition ) . Aiming sample size enables u detect difference 0.4 intervention control arm , find number observation require per CPD group depend number group include study . As see , small number group include study , number require observation per GP become large `` bad case '' scenario . Thus , effort go recruit maximal number group . Varying cluster size drop-outs reduce power ( Hemming et al. , 2011 ) , thus plan randomize 40 CPD group , 20 group . Time schedule : A pre-intervention pilot study register use priority set referral start November 2013 . The pre-intervention registration referral start December 2013 . Intervention start January 2014 last 3 month . Registration last April 2014 , 1000 consecutive referral register . Analysis article work do April September 2014 . Preparation dissertation do October 2014 March 2015 .</detailed_description>
