	<brief_summary>Multiple study show hydroxyurea clinical efficacy prevent acute painful episode reduce need blood transfusion child sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) , study conduct malaria endemic region sub-Saharan Africa , area child SCA . The primary goal study investigate safety efficacy hydroxyurea child SCA malaria endemic region within sub-Saharan Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The risk malaria hematologic toxicity hydroxyurea child SCA live malaria endemic region unknown . Some change associate hydroxyurea treatment ( increase nitric oxide HbF ) would expect protect malaria , data hydroxyurea-related endothelial change think important malaria pathogenesis ( e.g . intracellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1 , von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α ) unclear , study suggest factor might increase hydroxyurea others suggest difference decrease . The specific aim study follow : 1 . Determine incidence malaria child sickle cell anemia treat hydroxyurea vs. placebo 2 . Establish frequency hematologic toxicity adverse event child sickle cell anemia treat hydroxyurea vs. placebo 3 . Define relationship hydroxyurea treatment fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) , soluble ICAM-1 ( sICAM-1 ) nitric oxide ( NO ) level , level factor risk subsequent malaria . Two hundred child Mulago Hospital Sickle Cell Clinic ( MHSCC ) Kampala , Uganda randomize receive either hydroxyurea ( 100 ) placebo ( 100 ) fix dose 20 ± 2.5 mg/kg/day . The primary study endpoint evaluate twelve month study treatment . After twelve month study treatment , child enter follow-up phase receive additional twelve month open-label hydroxyurea treatment they/their parent wish consultation local physician MHSCC . The working hypothesis research study : 1 . The incidence malaria great child SCA treat hydroxyurea treat placebo 2 . Children SCA treat hydroxyurea medication-related hematologic toxicity , neutropenia , increase SCA-related adverse event ( e.g . pain crisis , hospitalization , requirement blood transfusion ) compare child treat placebo 3 . Hydroxyurea increase HbF plasma NO level decrease plasma sICAM-1 level ; HbF plasma NO level inversely correlate , plasma sICAM-1 level positively correlate , subsequent malaria incidence</detailed_description>
