	<brief_summary>To improve radiation therapy prostate cancer , investigator must able accurately identify tumour . By use advanced functional imaging technique available state-of-the-art MRI scanner clearly show specific location tumour inside prostate , investigator use advanced radiation therapy technique specifically target tumor control radiotherapy clinic visit possible . This different current technique treat whole prostate gland dose , deliver 7-8 week daily radiotherapy visit . By increase radiation dose active tumor still maintain adequate radiation dose rest prostate , investigator hope good control prostate cancer reduce complication nearby normal tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional MR-guided Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project combine advance functional image prostate cancer hypofractionation stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) , aim improve tumour control reduce maintain normal tissue complication . The strategy make use combine effectiveness several functional imaging approach identify dominant lesion ( ) within prostate . An SBRT treatment plan design utilizes 5 fraction treat entire prostate gland additional boost dominant lesion . The low dose entire prostate reduce normal tissue complication still effective treat prostate cancer increase dose dominant lesion improve tumour control . The use 5 fraction reduce number patient visit , thus reduce overall treatment cost .</detailed_description>
