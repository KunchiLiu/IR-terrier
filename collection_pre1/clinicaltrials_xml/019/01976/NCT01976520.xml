	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety vaccination Oncoquest-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) vaccine ( autologous tumor cell extract vaccine ) . II . To evaluate feasibility Oncoquest-CLL production administration previously untreated patient CLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical response [ define International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 ( iwCLL2008 ) ] Oncoquest-CLL vaccine treatment-naive patient CLL . II . To evaluate T B cell immune responses autologous leukemia cell induce Oncoquest-CLL vaccine . III . To measure progression-free survival patient treat Oncoquest-CLL vaccine . IV . To evaluate change absolute lymphocyte count lymphocyte double time vaccine administration correlate immune response . OUTLINE : Patients receive autologous tumor vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) Study Day 1 15 , monthly 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month , every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
