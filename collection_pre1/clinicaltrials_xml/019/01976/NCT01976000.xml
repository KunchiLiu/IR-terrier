	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic colorectal surgery widely accept worldwide ; however , despite well-known benefit comparable oncological outcome , still limited lack tactile sensation reduce operative field view . In addition , inconsistency number course mesenteric vessel significantly influence learn curve 30 70 case require proficiency . To overcome limitation , vascular anatomy map use CT-angiography , image process render software reconstruct three-dimensional model mesenteric vessel . The aim study assess influence visualize three-dimensional vascular anatomy learn curve laparoscopic colorectal surgery.All patient underwent laparoscopic leave right hemicolectomies January 2012 January 2014 evaluate inclusion study . To assess influence preliminary knowledge colonic vascular anatomy learn curve , consider 2 group two surgeon different level experience . In first group ( group A ) , surgeon able view 3D reconstruction surgery , surgeon Group B able view 3D reconstruction surgery .</brief_summary>
