	<brief_summary>Up , data early single coagulation screen exist extreme low birth weight infant ( ELBW ) infant . In neonatal practice , coagulation abnormality preterm baby primarily investigate measure prothrombin time ( PT ) . In fact , FVII activity , important determinant PT , strongly associate bleeding risk . Thus , method measure PT small volume sample ( 10μL ) provide possibility serial monitoring even ELBW infant ( CoaguChek®XS , Roche Diagnostics , Vienna , Austria ) ) . Substitution fesh frozen plasma seem beneficial ELBW infant first trial rFVII reveal promising result patient population . Thus , coagulation monitoring might lead early adequate therapy therefore well outcome . The investigator hypothesize ELBW infant ( &lt; 1000g birth weight ) primary severe prolongation prothrombin time development severe prothrombin prolongation sequential monitoring may frequent severe bleed incident ( Intraventricular haemorrhage pulmonary haemorrhage ) . The investigator aim explore whether monitor PT predict bleed event ELBW child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It recently report `` early '' , i.e . first 48h life , coagulation screening may identify infant risk severe IVH . Unfortunately , past screen coagulation abnormality correction haemostatic defect prothrombin complex concentrate , cryoprecipitate platelet concentrate ) fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) limit effect preterm infant . This could due short duration action , incomplete restoration coagulation water osmotic load associate FFP administration . However recently , use coagulopathy screen strategy ( one blood sample within first 2h birth ) substitution FFP decrease risk develop IVH infant bear 23 26 week gestation . Recombinant Factor VII ( rFVII ) provide new therapeutic option overcome FFP associate side effect . Small trial , include infant pulmonary hemorrhage , show safety effectiveness rFVII VLBW infant ; however randomise control trial publish far . As outlined , bleed complication still major problem extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants coagulation abnormality associate bleeding . Up , data early single screen exist coagulation monitor multiple blood sample apply . In neonatal practice , coagulation abnormality preterm baby primarily investigate measure prothrombin time ( PT ) . In fact , FVII activity , important determinant PT , strongly associate bleeding risk . Thus , method measure PT small volume sample ( 10μL ) provide possibility serial monitoring even ELBW infant . Substitution FFP seem beneficial ELBW infant first trial rFVII reveal promising result patient population . Thus , coagulation monitoring might lead early adequate therapy therefore well outcome .</detailed_description>
