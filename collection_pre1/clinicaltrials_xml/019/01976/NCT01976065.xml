	<detailed_description>This multi-center randomized clinical trial design test whether regenerative endodontic procedure use tissue engineering principle ( REGENDO ) , revascularization ( REVASC ) endodontic procedure , compare standard apexification treatment use mineral trioxide aggregate barrier-MTA apexification ( APEX ) , produce significantly well composite clinical outcome treatment immature permanent teeth pulpal necrosis . This study use antibiotic mixture call Triple Antibiotic Paste ( TAP ) , consist ciprofloxacin , metronidazole minocycline , tooth disinfection root canal study arm REGENDO REVASC . The FDA issue Investigational New Drug ( IND ) number allow use triple antibiotic mixture trial . Other dental material use study already FDA approve use human provide matrix promotion tissue growth root canal space . The study also attempt identify type bacteria within root canal space surround tissue analyze small sample collect cotton-tip applicator . This clinical trial hope determine three treatment method help tooth grow strong survive least two year treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 620 Participant permanent tooth necrotic pulp ( defined lack responsiveness electrical pulp test cold [ EndoIce ] test ) . If tooth traumatize , pulpal necrosis define either : 1 ) response electrical pulp test cold [ EndoIce ] test three month trauma , 2 ) presence periapical lesion , 3 ) radiographic evidence root resorption , 4 ) discoloration crown . Tooth question restorable ( defined Class A Class B use Samet Jotkowitz classification ) without need stainless steel crown . Incomplete ( i.e. , immature ) root development define apical foramen â‰¥1.0mm ( foramina &gt; 1.0mm multirooted teeth ) . At least 5 mm root development ( CEJ radiographic apex ) . Willing able provide inform assent/consent . Legal guardian willing able provide inform consent . No access telephone study contact . Unable comprehend study material English Spanish . Subject available follow 12 24 month . Previous allergic response ciprofloxacin , metronidazole minocycline material use study . History systemic disease alter immune function include diabetes , immunodeficiency , leukemia , Addison 's Cushing 's disease . History take immunosuppressant chemotherapeutic agent include glucocorticoid past 3 month . Clinical radiographic evidence root fracture alveolar fracture . Tooth question receive prior endodontic obturation . Tooth question class III mobility dens invaginatus . Tooth question history avulsion extraoral dry time longer 1 hour . Clinical judgement ( documentation reason ) Radiographic clinical identification ankylosis ( replacement resorption ) inflammatory ( infectionrelated ) root resorption .</criteria>
