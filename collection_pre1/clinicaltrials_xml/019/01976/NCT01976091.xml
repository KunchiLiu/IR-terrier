	<brief_title>Gene Transfer Clinical Trial LGMD2D ( Alpha-sarcoglycan Deficiency ) Using scAAVrh74.tMCK.hSGCA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose clinical trial dose escalation study self-complementary scAAVrh74.tMCK.hSGCA LGMD2D ( alpha-sarcoglycan deficient ) subject deliver via major low limb artery leg sequentially isolated limb perfusion ( ILP ) . Three cohort ( Cohorts 1A , 1B , 2 ) undergo gene transfer dose escalation scheme establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use toxicity . Two ( n=2 ) adult wheelchair-dependent patient enrol Cohort 1A three ( n =3 ) ambulatory subject enrol Cohort 1B . Three ( n =3 ) ambulatory subject enrol Cohort 2 . The first cohort ( 1A ) receive dose 1E12 vg/kg single limb delivery whole limb . This dose deliver limbs Cohort 1B . Cohort 2 receive total dose escalation 3E12vg/kg per limb deliver extremity . The vector infuse indwell catheter femoral artery . This one-time vector infusion isolate limb 10-minute dwell time . The total vector genome dose subject adjust round close 10 kg . Safety monitor infusion include : activated clotting time , limb gas , real time monitor arterial venous access pressure , perfusate temperature . Safety endpoint assess change hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis , immunologic response rAAVrh74 hSGCA , report history observation symptom . Efficacy measure six minute walk test well direct muscle test strength ( MVICT ) low limb muscle . These quantitative measure do baseline , day 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 , end 1st 2nd year . Subjects evaluate baseline , infusion visit ( day 0-2 ) , return follow visit day 7 , 14 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 . On Day 180 , subject undergo muscle biopsy inject muscle one leg compare pre-treatment biopsy do baseline screen opposite leg establish size muscle fiber potential toxicity gene transfer .</detailed_description>
