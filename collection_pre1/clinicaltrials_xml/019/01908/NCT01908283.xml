	<brief_summary>Patients inflammatory bowel disease increase risk infection due baseline disease subsequent immunocompromising regimen . Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) high mortality morbidity , particularly immunosuppressed patient . A polysaccharide vaccine cover 23 different serotypes pneumococcus ( PPSV23 ) currently recommend immunocompromised patient reduce risk invasive pneumococcal infection ( bacteremia , meningitis , pneumonia ) . Its immunogenicity however limit , magnitude duration , even healthy individual . Several study investigate immunogenicity PPSV23 patient IBD report marked inhibitory effect immunosuppressive therapy vaccine response . A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) originally develop protect young child demonstrate highly effective safe . PCV13 contain polysaccharide thirteen different serotypes , conjugate inactivated diphtheria toxin , capacity induce primary memory response . PCV also appear much immunogenic PPSV23 immunocompromised pediatric adult patient . Whether therapeutic regimen may nevertheless prevent induction protective response PCV13 yet unknown . To date , study yet report immunogenicity / safety PCV13 adult IBD patient . Study 's objective - Primary objective : evaluate immunogenicity safety profile PCV13 immunization IBD patient - Secondary objective : evaluate relative influence treatment disease immune response PCV13 immunization - Tertiary objective : evaluate immunity/vulnerability vaccine-preventable disease ( VZV , measles ) IBD cohort Switzerland ( optional , depend fund )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Inclusion : Patients eligible study part SIBDCS follow Switzerland Geneva , Vaud , Neuchatel Bern . Gastroenterologist present study patient routine follow-up visit . Inclusion cumulative , 2 group 150 patient without ( Group 1 ) ( Group 2 ) immunosuppressive treatment . B . Intervention 1 . Vaccine history evaluation : A questionnaire fill baseline include question establish patient ' history vaccine-preventable disease and/or immunization . 2 . Serologic evaluation : Blood take inclusion baseline serological evaluation pneumococcus . Antibody analyse perform use enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) quantify antigen-specific immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibody . Serological evaluation tetanus , measles VZV could perform study extension , depend fund available . 3 . Pneumococcal immunization : PCV13 ( 1 dose=0.5ml , intra-muscular ) administrate inclusion visit . Optional intervention ( depend available fund ) : 4 . Additional missing immunization could identify study team individualize level , base patient 's immunological record , presence absence immunosuppression . C. Assessment effectiveness : A second blood sample schedule 2 month ( minimum 1 , maximum 4 ) PCV13 administration assess vaccine response PCV13 . D. Assessment safety : Vaccine safety monitor use standardized diary card record local systemic side effect week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 immunization . Patient also contact phone week 6 investigator ask standardize question regard vaccine safety . Potential change disease activity ( vaccine-induced flare ) monitor follow 6 month , data collect SIBDCS database .</detailed_description>
