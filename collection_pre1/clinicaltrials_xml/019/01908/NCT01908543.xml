	<brief_summary>Managing iron deficiency important 1 billion individual worldwide , avoid blood transfusion , excessive strain vital organ depend iron-containing haemoglobin deliver oxygen tissue . Iron deficiency particular problem people inherited condition hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) . Their iron deficiency anaemia result blood loss , especially nose ( nosebleed , often need additional iron replace lose bleeding . Our goal stratify HHT patient high/low absorber iron ; define extra iron need adjust current likely future blood loss ; work achieve safely individual improve later health . We test hypothesis inform assessment iron intake post absorption cellular profile change recommendation iron intake HHT patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Relevant patient due come clinic program investigation unit offer opportunity participate study . Up 100 consent individual - additional 15 ml supplementary research blood take - receive single tablet ferrous sulphate 200mg - fill questionnaires formally evaluate nosebleed loss dietary iron intake precede 12 month - second blood sample later day ( 20 mls blood ) The primary outcome measure change serum iron level post iron tablet . Other outcome measure include : - Haematinic index indicate whether iron requirement meet previously . - Additional predict iron intake requirement adjust haemorrhagic iron loss</detailed_description>
