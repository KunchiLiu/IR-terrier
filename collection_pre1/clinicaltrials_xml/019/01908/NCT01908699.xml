	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria The following inclusion criterion enrol study : 1 . Male female , age 18 80 year ( inclusive ) . 2 . Established diagnosis pulmonary arterial hypertension either idiopathic familial PAH , collagen vascular disease associate PAH , PAH associate HIV infection , PAH induce anorexigens/toxins , PAH associate repaired congenital systemictopulmonary shunt ( repair ≥1 year ) . 3 . If HIV positive , CD4 lymphocyte count ≥200 cells/mm3 within 30 day Baseline Visit receive current standard care antiretroviral effective medication . 4 . At Screening Visit , WHO functional class III IV decline unsatisfactory clinical response current PAH therapy . 5 . At Baseline Visit , WHO functional class III IV decline unsatisfactory clinical response inhale treprostinil therapy . 6 . Able walk unassisted ( oxygen use allow ) . 7 . A 6Minute Walk distance ( 6MWD ) ≥ 100 meter Screening Visit . 8 . Previous ( within five year prior Baseline Visit ) right heart cardiac catheterization ( RHC ) finding consistent PAH , specifically mean Pulmonary Arterial Pressure ( PAPm ) ≥25 mmHg ( rest ) , Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure ( PCWP ) ( leave ventricular end diastolic pressure ) ≤15 mmHg , Pulmonary Vascular Resistance ( PVR ) &gt; 3 mmHg/L/min . 9 . Echocardiography exclude clinically significant leave heart disease ( e.g . leave sided valve disease , wall motion abnormality suggest myocardial infarction , leave ventricular hypertrophy , etc ) . 10 . Pulmonary function test conduct within 12 month Screening period confirm follow : 1 . Total lung capacity ( TLC ) least 60 % ( predict value ) 2 . Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) least 50 % ( predict value ) . 11 . Subjects receive additional FDA approve PAH therapy must stable current dose least 30 day prior Baseline Visit , apart modification anticoagulant diuretic dosage . 12 . Must complete 90 day uninterrupted inhaled treprostinil treatment receive stable dose inhale treprostinil least 30 day prior Baseline eligible randomization study . 13 . Women childbearing potential ( define less 1 year postmenopausal surgically sterile ) must practice abstinence use two highly effective method contraception ( define method birth control result low failure rate , i.e. , less 1 % per year , approve hormonal contraceptive , barrier method [ condom diaphragm ] use spermicide , intrauterine device ) . Subject must negative pregnancy test Screening Baseline Visits . 14 . Willing able comply study requirement restriction . Exclusion Criteria Patients meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . Pregnant lactating . 2 . Has previous experience beraprost BPS314d ( i.e. , BPSIR , BPSMR BPS314d MR ) . 3 . PAH related condition cover inclusion criterion , include limited pulmonary venous hypertension , pulmonary venoocclusive disease , pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis , chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . 4 . History interstitial lung disease , unless subject collagen vascular disease pulmonary function test conduct within 12 month Baseline Visit demonstrate total lung capacity ≥60 % predict . 5 . Has active hemorrhagic condition ( e.g. , upper digestive tract hemorrhage , hemoptysis , etc ) , preexist condition , Investigator 's judgment , may increase risk develop hemorrhage study ( e.g. , hemophilia ) . Transient hemorrhage ( e.g. , epistaxis , normal menstrual bleeding , gingival bleeding , hemorrhoidal bleeding , etc ) preclude enrollment . 6 . Has receive investigational drug , device therapy within 30 day prior Baseline Visit schedule receive another investigational drug , device therapy course study . 7 . Has musculoskeletal disease disease would significantly limit ambulation . 8 . Has form unrepaired recently repair ( &lt; 1 year ) congenital systemictopulmonary shunt patent foramen ovale . 9 . Evidence significant coronary arterial disease symptom , angina . 10 . Left side myocardial disease evidence leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % , shorten fraction &lt; 22 % . 11 . Has creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ( use CockroftGault formula ) require hemodialysis . 12 . Has ChildsPugh class C liver cirrhosis . 13 . Has previous atrial septostomy . 14 . Any clinically significant illness abnormal laboratory value ( measure Screening period ) , opinion Investigator , might put subject risk harm study might adversely affect interpretation study data . 15 . Anticipated survival less 1 year due concomitant disease . The Sponsor recognize pulmonary hypertension population complex diverse . In order facilitate enrollment appropriate subject pivotal trial , Investigators strongly encourage contact medical director study team discuss potential study subject comorbid condition enrollment study . See Appendix 9 additional detail . No waiver entry criterion allowable study . Subjects initially ineligible study may reassess eligibility consultation Sponsor .</criteria>
