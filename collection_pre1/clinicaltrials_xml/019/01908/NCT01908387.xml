	<brief_summary>To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral azacitidine different treatment schedule Japanese subject hematological neoplasm</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study CC-486 Japanese Subjects With Hematological Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study evaluate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , safety , pharmacokinetics , preliminary efficacy CC-486 Japanese subject hematological neoplasm include myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , multiple myeloma ( MM ) , non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . A standard phase 1 design MTD determination , open label , dose ascending , `` 3 + 3 '' design , adopt study . This study consist screen phase , MTD determination phase , treatment phase . Each subject continue study treatment documentation progressive disease discontinuation study treatment reason . Originally MDS subject target MTD CC-486 administer daily ( QD ) 21 day 28-day cycle would evaluate study . Currently CC-486 clinically develop 14-day 21-day dosing schedule various disease . This study suspend amend protocol evaluate MTD different dose schedule large population . This study re-opened amend protocol approve institutional review board study site .</detailed_description>
