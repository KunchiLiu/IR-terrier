	<brief_title>Fixation Using Alternative Implants Treatment Hip Fractures ( FAITH-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Femoral neck fracture type hip fracture associate high complication rate poor functional outcome . It estimate 300,000 hip fracture occur patient age 50 annually . Hip fracture young aged patient particularly devastate profound impairment quality life function . Virtually patient require surgical repair fracture unlike elderly hip fracture , failure surgery offer option salvage . Arthroplasty successful treatment elderly patient ; however , hip replacement viable option young patient higher functional demand work recreational activity tolerate joint replacement . There one way perform internal fixation femoral neck fracture . Cancellous screw traditionally prefer internal fixation implant femoral neck fracture . Multiple screw ( 2 ) use fixation , advocate implant promote construct 's superior torsional stability , limited disruption femoral head blood supply , minimally invasive insertion , retention viable bone large slide hip screw ( SHS ) . On hand , slide hip screw gain popularity evidence suggest SHS provide great fracture stability may reduce patient complication . It currently unknown method internal fixation provide best outcomes patient . Femoral neck fracture treatment complicate vitamin D insufficiency many 8 10 trauma patient . Vitamin D play important role musculoskeletal health bone quality regulate serum calcium homeostasis . Laboratory research human clinical study suggest important association vitamin D , musculoskeletal health , improve fracture heal . Experimental animal study demonstrate concentration vitamin D metabolites high fracture callus compare uninjured contralateral bone , vitamin D supplementation lead decreased time fracture union increase callus vascularity , vitamin D increase mechanical bone strength compare control . Clinical study also demonstrate vitamin D supplementation increase callus volume proximal humerus fracture , increase number diameter type II muscle fibre , improve wound healing , however , effect vitamin D supplementation patient femoral neck fracture unknown . Using 2x2 factorial design , participant randomly allocate one four treatment arm . Participants allocate cancellous screw group receive multiple thread screw ( minimum 3 screw minimum diameter 6.5 mm ) allocate slide hip screw group receive single large diameter partially thread screw affixed proximal femur sideplate use minimum 2 screws fixation . Participants allocate vitamin D Group receive bottle 2,000 International Units ( IU ) vitamin D3 drop . Participants instructed take two drop daily six month , total daily dose 4,000 IU . Participants placebo group receive identical bottle placebo drop active ingredient . Similarly , instructed take two drop daily six month . All vitamin D3 supplement placebo bottle label blind manner accord Health Canada Good Manufacturing Practice . Participation study last 12 month . In-person participant follow-up visit occur enrollment ( baseline ) , post-surgery , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month post-surgery . Data outcome radiographs collect follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
