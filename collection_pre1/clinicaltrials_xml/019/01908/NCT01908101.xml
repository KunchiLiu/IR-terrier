	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Frequency alopecia absence decrease &lt; 50 % . II . Incidence grade 3 4 neutropenia &lt; 30 % . III . Incidence sensory neuropathy ( grade ) &lt; 25 % . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess role circulate endothelial cell precursor ( CEPs ) apoptotic circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) , predict early response treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 2-5 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
