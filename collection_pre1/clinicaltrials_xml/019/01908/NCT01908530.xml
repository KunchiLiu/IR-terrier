	<brief_title>Clinical Assessment Novel Microprobe Array Continuous Glucose Monitor Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous knowledge ambient glucose level benefit patient T1DM , especially troublesome hypoglycaemia . Existing monitor require skin puncture access interstitial fluid sense glucose content . Despite clinical benefit , use associate discomfort accuracy questionable hypoglycaemia . The development painless continuous glucose monitor regard top research priority patient diabetes . A novel continuous glucose monitoring device develop Imperial College base microprobe technology . It consist small , wearable patch ( ~1 cm2 ) , size conventional postage stamp , contain microscopic projection ( microprobes ) penetrate outermost skin layer . It access interstitial fluid sense glucose content without stimulate skin nerve fibre reach blood vessel within skin layer . The microprobe surface consistency sandpaper . It push skin applicator allow penetrate skin layer access interstitial fluid minimally invasive manner . The device disposable optimum performance assess five day . The advantage microprobe technology demonstrate clinical situation include painless insertion , absence bleed low infection risk . The large surface area utilise microprobe device potential improve device sensitivity accuracy . Pre-clinical validation test demonstrate ability device respond accurately variable glucose concentration penetrate outermost skin layer without fracture . We aim develop device clinical study non-diabetic subject subject type 1 diabetes allow painless accurate continuous glucose monitoring . The study recruit 16 non-diabetic subject 20 subject type 1 diabetes . It conduct four phase ; oPhase 1 assess safety , primary outcome , efficacy , secondary outcome , non-diabetic subject six hour clinical research facility device fit cannula insert venous sample every 15 minute measure venous blood glucose ( YSI ) . Safety assess regard skin inflammation pain . Efficacy assess phase assess magnitude current measure microprobe array sensor comparison measure ISF glucose concentration simultaneous venous blood glucose sample ( YSI ) . oPhase 2 also assess safety , primary outcome , efficacy , secondary outcome , non-diabetic subject period 24 hour . The first six hour clinical research facility ( phase 1 ) , subject allow go home device assess safety period . oPhase 3 aim assess efficacy device primary outcome safety secondary outcome . This subject type 1 diabetes 24 hour inpatient . Efficacy assess mechanically ( ability penetrate stratum corneum ) functionally ( ability accurately sense ISF glucose ) . The derived ISF glucose level compare simultaneous venous glucose sample ( YSI ) commercially available CGM device ( iPro2 , Medtronic ) . Assessment microprobe penetration stratum corneum perform use confocal microscopy , optical coherence tomography skin biopsy . oPhase 4 aim assess efficacy device primary outcome safety secondary outcome . This subject type 1 diabetes 5 day ambulatory situation . Efficacy assess compare microprobe sensor derive ISF glucose level ISF glucose level measure use commercially available CGM device ( iPro2 , Medtronic ) .</detailed_description>
