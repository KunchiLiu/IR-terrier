	<brief_title>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Enriched With Emotion Regulation Training Multiple Somatoform Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Somatic symptom cause known biomedical condition ( `` somatoform disorder '' ) highly prevalent , involve high risk chronicity , one major reason doctor visit , tremendous burden health care system . Despite economic relevance , research activity disproportionately low . The intervention evidence grade I cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . However , average effect size CBT somatization syndrome moderate ( Cohen 's &lt; 0.5 ) , powerful intervention need . There convince evidence patient somatoform disorder emotion regulation deficit , address current CBT approach . Based positive result small pilot study expect enrich CBT program emotion regulation technique improve treatment outcome . The primary goal propose project therefore evaluate hypothesis randomize design . Patients primarily recruit via referral primary care doctor . After screen phase baseline assessment different self- clinician-rating scale ( see Outcome Measures ) follow . If participant fulfill eligibility criterion randomize one two study arm : cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. cognitive-behavioral therapy enrich emotion regulation strategy . After every therapy session patient screen regard aspect therapeutic alliance , adverse event , symptom intensity/annoyance . The post assessment take place 20th session follow-up plan six month post treatment . Different method apply prevent bias assure high quality level current study . Data handling , data monitoring statistical analysis supervise Coordinating Center Clinical Trials ( KKS ) Philipps-University Marburg ; data quality safety principle apply . Additionally independent Data Safety Monitoring Board nominate . The study center visit study sit regularly verify correct procedure , data sampling , data management . Randomisation occur control centrally randomisation 's central office KKS Marburg . Furthermore current study constitute single-blinded trial . Assessment interview conduct analyzed people blind treatment condition . Additionally , treatment manualized , therapist receive intense training . Treatment fidelity/integrity analyze rating scheme 5 % randomly select videotaped treatment session . Allowed additional treatment study inclusion thoroughly monitor analyze . The sample size calculation base primary outcome variable `` somatization severity index '' Screening Somatoform Disorders ( SOMS-7T ) . Based result main validation study SOMS-7T , meta-analytic estimation , result pilot study efficacy ENCERT , power calculation yield necessary total sample size N=194 detect clinical relevant difference 4 point symptom reduction SOMS-7T two treatment power 0.80 alpha=.05 . With regard estimate drop-out rate 20 % , N=244 patient recruit . As main efficacy analysis primary outcome shall analyze linear mixed-effect model . It do accord Intention-to-Treat ( ITT ) principle : consider miss value potential source bias , handle accord framework Rubin . Secondary statistical analysis focus establish long term treatment efficacy describe pattern change . For purpose mean response model function time separate mixed effect linear model assessment . Furthermore , interindividual difference intraindividual change model use multilevel analysis longitudinal data . Multilevel longitudinal mediation analysis conduct order test whether effect treatment condition intraindividual change somatic symptom severity explain intraindividual change emotion regulation skill .</detailed_description>
