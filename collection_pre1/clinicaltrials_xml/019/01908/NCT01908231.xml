	<detailed_description>Pulmonary embolism ( PE ) represent 0.4 % hospitalization third lead cause death due cardiovascular disease ( 1 ) . In contrast stroke acute coronary syndrome , mortality decrease recent decade likely due minor advance short-term prognostication treatment strategy ( 2 ) .The presence shock hypotension remain principal prognostic clinical marker , date , factor clearly indicate aggressive treatment heparin ( 3 ) . However , 5 % patient acute PE present shock . The majority PE patient normotensive usually treat heparin alone . Several study look new prognostic indicator order well stratify normotensive PE patient . A large body evidence show right ventricular dysfunction/injury marker elevation brain natriuretic peptide , troponins , echocardiographic evidence right ventricular dysfunction ( RVD ) associate adverse prognosis ( 3-8 ) . However , marker important limitation . Echocardiography usually available around-the-clock clinical setting , moreover share troponins natriuretic peptide good negative predictive value ( &gt; 90 % ) low positive predictive value ( 10 % ) short-term mortality , probably preclude marker ' usefulness target aggressive treatment ( 8 ) . Plasma lactate concentration marker severity tissue oxygen supply-to-demand imbalance . It may reflect tissue hypoperfusion also presence normal blood pressure . Accordingly , critical setting sepsis , plasma lactate concentration consider accurate prognostic marker rise hemodynamic impairment clinically evident ( 9 ) . Furthermore , plasma lactate concentration easily rapidly assayed arterial blood sample use blood gas analyzer , usually available emergency department ( EDs ) intensive care unit . Recently , retrospective study show plasma lactate ≥ 2 mmol/L associate high mortality rate patient acute PE ( 10 ) . Moreover prospective monocentric study confirm retrospective result reveal plasma lactate prognostic relevance beyond know clinical instrumental prognostic marker ( TELOS study , Ann Emerg Med , press , see attach file ) The aim present study prospectively investigate association plasma lactate concentration short-term adverse outcome patient acute PE . In particular , examine whether high plasma lactate ( ≥ 2 mmol/L ) associate high incidence PE relate major adverse event , define PE related death hemodynamic collapse &gt; 10 % within 7 day follow-up . Moreover investigate whether plasma lactate show incremental prognostic value clinically overt hemodynamic impairment RVD/injury marker , maintain prognostic relevance hypotensive normotensive PE patient .</detailed_description>
