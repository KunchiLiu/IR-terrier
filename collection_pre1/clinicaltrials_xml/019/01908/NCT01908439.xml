	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine validity measurement method base observation vibration stimulation-MUAP ( motor unit action potential ) ( 1 1 ) matching help measure human WBV-induced muscular reflex latency compare result latency determination obtain use classical method . The investigator ' principle hypothesis simple method capable determine WBV induce reflex response latency reliably complex method describe earlier . To achieve goal , investigator average electrical response soleus muscle ( sEMG multi motor unit ( MMU ) potential ) vertical force data obtain six vibration frequency test study . The investigator combine averaged EMG data belong six different vibration frequency generate 'cumulative average ' sEMG MMU subject . The investigator also obtain standard error cumulative average record indicate WBV-induced muscular reflex ( WBV-IMR ) latency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Simple Method Determine Reflex Latency During WBV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects Five healthy volunteer participate study . Procedures During WBV , subject ask stand upright vibration platform ( PowerPlate Pro5 , London , United Kingdom ) . Their hip knees neutral position . Subjects barefooted , sponge foam place vibration platform foot ( Figure 1 ) . The whole plate oscillates linear movement upward downward . Vibration amplitude 2.2 mm . WBV frequency vary randomly cover follow six frequency : 25 , 30 , 35 , 40,45 50 Hz . Each frequency last 60 second 15 second rest different frequency . A load sensor ( FC2331-0000-2000L Compression Load Sensor , France ) fix WBV platform order able determine induce muscular response latency . Subjects position WBV platform right heel place load sensor . Recordings MMUs , surface EMG ( sEMG ) force recording simultaneously do use Powerlab data acquisition system ( ADInstruments , Oxford , United Kingdom ) . A sampling frequency 40 kiloHertz ( kHz ) use . Data analyze offline use MATLAB ( R2012a 7.14.0.739 ) . In order record sEMG , Ag/AgCl electrodes [ KENDALL ® Arbo ] disc radius 10 mm place 20 mm apart right soleus muscle belly , shave skin clean alcohol . The ground electrode place lateral malleolus . To record MMU activity , pair Teflon® insulate silver wire ( 75 µm core diameter ) use . About 3 mm tip silver wire strip Teflon ® coat order able record activity several motor unit . The pair wire insert right soleus muscle 25 G needle . Needle immediately withdraw leave fish-hooked wire muscle . A lip-clip electrode use ground electrode . All cable carefully tap skin minimize mechanical artifact . The subject instruct relax muscle throughout recording train use EMG feedback end . WBV may impair sense balance muscle may activate restore balance . To overcome issue , subject familiarize WBV 15 session WBV , subject ask use handle WBV device secure balance base support ( distance heel ) adjust wide . The distance heel usually 25 cm . Filtering Rectification regimens All force sensor recording 5 Hz high-pass filter . All sEMG recording 80 - 500 Hz band-pass filter ( Butterworth 1st order ) full-wave rectify overcome movement artifact . All MMU recording 100-5000 Hz band-pass filter ( Butterworth 1st order ) full-wave rectify . WBV - induce muscular reflex ( WBV-IMR ) latency In previous study , right soleus muscle sEMG measurement force sensor measurement place right heel WBV take synchronously find vibration stimulation MUAPs would match 1 1 . In study base previous observation , predict possible calculate latency use average method . All MMU sEMG data analyze apply respectively filter , rectification differentiation MATLAB ( R2012a 7.14.0.739 ) . Data analysis perform two stage : 1 . Detection moment mechanical stimulation threshold ( Force Sensor Data Averaging ) : Force sensor data average use Spike trigger average ( STA ) method . For , 50 second constant time interval preset vibration frequency WBV set use . All positive peak MMU sEMG trace mark . For positive peak , force sensor trace segment cover 75 ms previous positive peak . After , cumulative average 6 vibration set average . The standard error cumulative average force record calculate . The low point standard error force sensor average graphic consider start point mechanical stimulation trigger muscle response . 2 . Determination MUAP onset : EMG data average method manual method ( vibration stimulus MUAP coupling ) use .</detailed_description>
