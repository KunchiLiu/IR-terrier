	<brief_summary>Aromatase inhibitor show superior efficacy compare tamoxifen treatment hormonal receptor positive breast cancer postmenopausal patient . Side effect like osteoporosis , bone fracture muscle/bone pain however frequent use aromatase inhibitor compare tamoxifen . These side effect compromise patient ' well significant way may favour use Tamoxifen clinical practice . Furthermore evidence polymorphism CYP2D6 Gene might associate improved efficacy Tamoxifen equieffective aromatase inhibitor . Concerning pharmacogenetics aromatase inhibition know polymorphism CYP19A1 gene associate altered peripheral sex hormone level alter prognosis breast cancer patient . One study could even associate polymorphism CYP19A1 gene prolong time progression patient metastatic breast cancer treat letrozol . Therefore aim study identify biomarkers could predict efficacy adjuvant Letrozol treatment postmenopausal breast cancer patient .</brief_summary>
