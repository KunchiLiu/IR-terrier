	<brief_title>Phase I Study Assess Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics CUDC-427 When Given Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study evaluate safety tolerability CUDC-427 single agent administer orally , subject advance refractory solid tumor lymphoma . Sequential dose escalation cohort oral CUDC-427 plan . Subject enrollment dose escalation proceed accord standard 3+3 design . In absence intolerable toxicity , subject receive minimum 1 cycle ( 21 day ) study treatment , may continue receive additional cycle disease progression document treatment discontinuation criterion meet . No intrasubject dose escalation allow . During dose escalation phase , 3 additional subject may enrol previously clear dose level well define safety , tolerability activity study treatment . Similarly , MTD expansion cohort 12 evaluable subject may also enrol . Safety tolerability assess incidence severity adverse event assess NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v4.03 ) . A Safety Review Committee comprise Medical Monitor , Principal Investigators , Sponsor representative , convene review safety information decide upon dose escalation subject enrollment . The antitumor activity study treatment assess accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1.1 ) , Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma appropriate subject 's tumor type . Exploratory biological marker CUDC-427 activity assess tumor sample ( available ) , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) plasma .</detailed_description>
