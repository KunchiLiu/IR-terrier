	<detailed_description>The first three year life every child fundamental development , year offer unique window opportunity future health promotion , different investigation prove investing period life great economic benefit , social one . In Chile political decision invest valuable year translate creation national social program call `` Chile Crece Contigo '' . This Program seek intervene physical , cognitive socioemotional area development every Chilean child since conceive 4 year old promote best development outcome possible . The program identifies family psychosocial vulnerability offer specific intervention accord risk detect . In context different health social service provide pregnant woman health care visit , screen different psychosocial risk ( eg . Low social support , poverty , tobacco drug use ) accord screen various intervention offer Primary Health Care center ( eg . home visit ) . It describe group psychosocial risk prevalence interactional problem , specifically alteration attachment style child caregiver , high population without risk . This relevant give quality style attachment establish infancy predicts subsequent social , emotional cognitive development . Attachment style , secure , associated behavioural problem pre-school school age , psychopathology adolescence , later anxiety disorder higher rate use emergency health care service . One factor show predict attachment style establish child caregiver parental sensitivity ( also call maternal sensitivity ) - define every caregiver 's pattern conduct toward child soothes , increase comfort time reduces stress disinterest . It also consider capacity adult pay attention , interpret respond child´s need . The literature suggest adequate parental sensitivity associate secure attachment style end first year life , low parental sensitivity detect early life ( even early 6-8 week ) predict insecure style attachment age 2 . Preliminary Chilean data show 25 % biparental family 52.5 % monoparental family low income low parental sensitivity catalogue `` Interactional risk '' ( define score 6 less point CARE-Index scale ) , indicate need offer intervention specifically aim work caregiver-child relationship . Since creation Program `` Chile Crece Contigo '' great achievement toward promotion adequate infant development , especially cognitive physical area development , however initiatives socio emotional area lack . Issues caregiver child relationship address systematically , count intervention promote parental sensitivity development secure attachment relationship offer family psychosocial risk respond social necessity contribute promotion adequate infant mental health family health . Considering date intervention mean describe available used Primary Health Care exist , year 2008-2010 intervention design . The intervention elaborate accord method describe UK Medical Research Council . The intervention pilot two Family Primary Health center show improvement caregiver-child interaction . Analysis indicate 4 month intervention : caregiver value positively participate , loss participate , increase 33 % secure attachment style ( accord Massie-Campbell Scale ) statistically significant , could result significant large sample size . The intervention propose aim improve caregiver-child relationship , specifically focus parental sensitivity , easily applicable replicable Primary Health Care consider require little personnel training , material use easily available cheap Primary Health Care . However , question `` intervention propose impact parental sensitivity dyads psychosocial risk ? '' still address . We define term `` dyad '' two interact people , case : mother-infant . The objective study evaluate impact group intervention parental sensitivity primary health care dyad screen positive psychosocial risk pregnancy . Specific objective : - Evaluate percentage dyads catalogue `` Interactional risk '' intervention group compare control group - Evaluate change score parental sensitivity dyads intervention group compare control group - Evaluate change number depressive symptom mother dyad intervention group compare control group Methods : randomize clinical trial . Dyads ( mother-infants 4 12 month age ) screen pregnancy psychosocial risk 2 Family Health Care Centers La Pintana district Metropolitan Santiago , randomize : - Receive usual care ( `` control group '' ) consist : home visit , evaluation social worker planning intervention accord multidisciplinary team - Participate group intervention besides receive usual care The randomization do computer program seal dark envelope sequence remain occult dyad enters study . Parental sensitivity interactional risk measure CARE-Index scale 3 timing : enrollment ( interview do ) , immediately participate group workshop ( 1 2 week workshop finish ) 4 month ( measure time also control group ) . The score CARE-Index scale do expert external coder blind randomization group . Symptoms postpartum depression also measure Edinburgh postnatal depression scale ( EPDS ) . Statistical analysis : primary outcome change category `` Interactional risk '' CARE-Index scale . Secondary outcome change score parental sensitivity number depressive symptom . We describe data use average , percentile standard deviation quantitative variable proportion nominal variable . The bivariate analysis include χ2 test statistic test independent sample use SPSS 17.0 Software . The sample size determine detect significant difference percentage dyad change interactional risk category CARE-index scale intervention control group . Each group 90 dyad , assume change 5 % due pas time , change 20 % intervened dyad , power least 80 % 5 % significance level , estimate 20 % loss dyads execution investigation . The intervention consist group workshop ( 7 dyad child age 6 12 month two health care professional monitor ) four session two hour , hold weekly . One session characterize include father caregiver relevant upbringing child . Each session structure around various activity specifically deal skill associate parental sensitivity address relevant issue child rear , consider development child . The intervention design methodology propose UK Medical Research Council test pilot study 11 dyad two primary health care center show improvement 33 per cent secure attachment style dyad ( statistically significant ) . Recruiting , enrollment procedure : mother previously screen positive pregnancy psychosocial risk contact interview child 4 12 month old . In interview ask would like participate study sign inform consent form . Once do interview take place collect socio demographic data regard family , record 3 minute video dyad play ( cod CARE-index scale ) Edinburgh postnatal depression scale apply . The interviewer assign dyad intervention control group ( use close numbered envelope interviewer blind ) . If dyad recruit intervention group invite participate group workshop mention , besides receive usual intervention center dyads psychosocial risk . And ask come center measurement follow CARE-Index Edinburgh postnatal depression scale . If dyad recruit control group receive usual intervention center offer dyad psychosocial risk ask come following measurement ( intervention group ) . The recruiting do trained interviewer ( different health care professional work primary health care center ) follow strict protocol avoid miss enter data maintain confidentiality time . The data also manage strict confidential rule . If group intervention prove positive impact maternal sensitivity could use primary health care center , constitute effective form promote adequate socio emotional development first year life .</detailed_description>
