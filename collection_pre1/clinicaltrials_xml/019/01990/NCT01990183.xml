	<brief_summary>Stroke neurological condition affect population infant percentage consider marginal . Preterm infant high infant risk neurological damage . Currently , infant rehabilitation session time week rehabilitation centre accord basic neuroscience would necessary provide early , intensive multiaxial intervention . One option reduce cost entire European Healthcare System increase practice rehabilitation devise therapy technology administer home caregiver telemonitored rehabilitation staff . The aim proposal promote early intervention first year life reinforce therapy `` CareToy '' : portable low cost smart system telemonitored thus augment clinical effectiveness therapy reduce cost . The smart system base common baby gym , compose different module : ) instrument baby gym mechatronic hanging toy , infant ' action gym measure stimulated , b ) vision module , measure promote infant ' attention gaze movement c ) sensorized mat measure promote postural control . Each module also incorporate built-in signal processor , memory wireless communication . A fourth telerehabilitation module complete system allow system remotely communicate rehabilitation staff monitor assess rehabilitation technique . CareToy effectiveness home rehabilitation base system validated clinical trial least 50 preterm infant . The result project could large impact . CareToy may become commercial product , manufacture large scale distribute rehabilitation centre also home , sell rent Health Care System family therapeutic tool care intensity .</brief_summary>
