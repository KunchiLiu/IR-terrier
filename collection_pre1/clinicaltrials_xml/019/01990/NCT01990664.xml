	<criteria>1 . The subject must read , understand , sign Statement Informed Consent receive fully execute copy form . 2 . The subject must appear able willing adhere instruction set forth clinical protocol . 3 . The subject must interest wear contact lens . 4 . The subject must least 18 year old less 40 year age time consent . 5 . The subject 's vertexed spherical cylindrical refraction must result contact lens prescription eye available investigator 's choice study contact lens material ( ) . 6 . The subject must best correct visual acuity 20/30 good eye . 7 . The subject must require visual correction eye . 8 . The subject must lapse wearer ( define , noncontact lens wearer require optical correction previously fit previously purchase contact lenses since discontinue contact lens wear reason 6 month prior time consent ) . 9 . The subject must normal eye ( i.e. , ocular medication infection type ) . 1 . Currently pregnant lactating ( subject become pregnant study discontinue ) . 2 . Any ocular systemic allergy disease may interfere contact lens wear . 3 . Any systemic disease , autoimmune disease , use medication , may interfere contact lens wear . 4 . Entropion , ectropion , extrusion , chalazia , recurrent stye , glaucoma , history recurrent corneal erosion , aphakia , moderate corneal distortion . 5 . Any previous , plan , ocular intraocular surgery ( e.g. , radial keratotomy , photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) , LASIK , etc . ) 6 . Any grade 3 great slit lamp finding ( e.g. , edema , corneal neovascularization , corneal staining , tarsal abnormality , conjunctival injection ) FDA classification scale , previous history sign contact lens related corneal inflammatory event ( e.g. , past peripheral ulcer round peripheral scar ) , ocular abnormality tha may contraindicate contact lens wear . 7 . Any ocular infection . 8 . Any corneal distortion result previous hard rigid gas permeable contact lens wear . 9 . Participation contact lens lens care trial within one year prior study enrollment . 10 . History binocular vision abnormality strabismus . 11 .
