	<brief_summary>The majority individual advance ESRD reduce exercise capacity part due decrease muscle mass . This lead reduced ability perform daily activity , great incidence fall , reduce quality life . The mechanisms responsible loss muscle mass ESRD understood well . This study design determine effectiveness exercise program improve muscle mass , exercise capacity quality life person ESRD . In addition , study attempt well understand muscle loss occur people ESRD , influence exercise mechanism , whether response exercise enhance nutrient supplementation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Prevent Muscle Mass Functional Loss Elderly Dialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elderly patient comprise half end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) population , especially vulnerable loss muscle mass , strength function , change lead frailty increase morbidity mortality . Many factor contribute decline muscle mass function elderly uremic apart age co-morbid condition , waste worsen inactivity . Studies maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) patient show exercise ( EX ) , include endurance , resistance combine , counteract loss muscle mass function . However study specifically target elderly , involve small number lack control impact long-term outcome unknown . Nevertheless , despite substantial evidence indicate EX beneficial low cost , EX part routine care MHD patient . In contrast EX regard standard care waste elderly also cardiac patient . Some protection uremic muscle waste also afford adequate protein-calorie intake . Amino acid ( AA ) source serve substrates protein synthesis ( PS ) also directly activate mTOR signal pathway stimulate PS . In normal subject AA ingest time resistance EX , anabolic signal PS enhance lead increase muscle mass . Whether EX AA stimulate signal response intact elderly MHD patient unknown little information cellular process invoke . Taking together , investigator plan test hypothesis home-based EX program , effective cardiac patient , improve cardiopulmonary function muscle mass function elderly MHD patient . Also , pilot study investigator examine whether protein supplement acutely enhance EX stimulate anabolic signaling . Functionally impaired MHD subject age 65-80 yr randomize 2 group 30 , one undergoing EX usual care . After 3 month , half group receive one-time protein-calorie supplement placebo acute bout EX muscle biopsied examine signal response . Assays baseline 3 month include cardiopulmonary function , muscle strength function , body composition DEXA , thigh muscle volume composition CT , quality life ( QOL ) cognitive function , nutritional , inflammatory , lipid biochemical status morphologic molecular analysis biopsied muscle . The investigator anticipate home-based EX counteract muscle wasting , enhance cardiopulmonary muscle function QOL , reduce surrogate marker long-term outcome . New insight mechanisms whereby EX nutrient induce anabolic response muscle elderly uremics provide may serve basis devise strategy counteract loss muscle mass function . Finally , investigator anticipate EX program `` user friendly '' may thus form part routine care elderly perhaps young MHD patient . If short-term benefit evident study elderly MHD patient , could form basis comprehensive long-term outcome study .</detailed_description>
