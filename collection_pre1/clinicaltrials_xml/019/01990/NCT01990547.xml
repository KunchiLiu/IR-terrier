	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine whether functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , distinguish service member without traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) , well posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) receive either virtual reality exposure therapy ( VRET ) PTSD treatment exposure therapy . The investigator investigator previously identify change function multiple region brain combat veteran PTSD , investigator also see structural change white matter associate combat TBI also link change function , turn PTSD symptom . However , investigator need confirm finding large number , also need discern whether fMRI distinguish something significantly different PTSD TBI vs. follow TBI . Finally , investigator previously demonstrate exposure therapy ameliorate functional change brain induce PTSD , investigator know similar change occur form therapy , investigator seek compare two directly . It expectation finding well inform choice therapy service member combat-related PTSD , without TBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator previously demonstrate military service member ( SMs ) PTSD related deployment Iraq Afghanistan fMRI brain activation pattern similar report population PTSD . The investigator also demonstrate significant improvement , normalization , activation brain area follow exposure therapy . In study investigator assess recovery SMs receive virtual reality exposure therapy , compare healthy veteran , history blast exposure PTSD receive usual care . The investigator hope ( 1 ) demonstrate fMRI distinguish military service member PTSD , mild TBI , neither ; ( 2 ) demonstrate significant difference see brain activation pattern merely repeat fMRI scan 3 month interval significant change present fact represent effect exposure therapy intervention ; ( 3 ) discern whether PTSD TBI different activation pattern PTSD absence TBI ; ( 4 ) identify fMRI characteristic resilience service member deploy develop PTSD .</detailed_description>

Healthy OIF/OEF veteran deploy least 3 month support OIF/OEF blast exposure ( i.e. , within 100 foot blast , pressure wave knock ground cause physical symptom , vehicle rid hit improvise explosive device , jar seat ) PTSD : PCLM &lt; 50 , negative history concussion loss consciousness . 2 . OIF/OEF veteran history blast exposure ( define ) meet criterion PTSD ( PCLM &lt; 50 ) 3 . OIF/OEF veteran PTSD receive usual care : form individual group psychotherapy long include exposure therapy , and/or may combination prescription psychotropic medication ; participant group may may history blast exposure , provide loss consciousness 60 minute otherwise meet criterion moderate severe TBI . 4 . OIF/OEF veteran PTSD receive VRET WRNMMC IRB approve protocol entitle `` Enhancing Exposure Therapy PTSD : Virtual Reality Imaginal Exposure Cognitive Enhancer '' : must meet entry criterion study ; notably , must combatrelated PTSD ; participant group may may history blast exposure , provide loss consciousness 60 minute otherwise meet criterion moderate severe TBI . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Dementia inability read understand write oral question reason . 2 .
