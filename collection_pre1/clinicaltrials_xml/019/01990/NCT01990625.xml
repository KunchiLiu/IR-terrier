	<brief_summary>In many low-income country , use ultrasound medical officer non-physician health care staff ( e.g. , midwife ) antenatal identification high risk pregnancy new intervention require authoritative investigation . The primary hypothesis assess study antenatal ultrasound screening perform medical officer non-physician health care staff significantly reduce composite outcome consist maternal mortality maternal near miss , stillbirth neonatal mortality low-resource setting . Underpinning hypothesis two assumption . The first assumption antenatal detection complicate pregnancy lead appropriate referral right time complicate pregnancy comprehensive emergency obstetric neonatal care ( EmONC ) facility . The second assumption ultrasound 's introduction increase antenatal attendance lead great rate institutional delivery . To assess underlying assumption beyond composite end point , study investigate health system impact compact ultrasound . Secondary outcome include antenatal attendance rate , institutional delivery rate basic EmONC facility , referral rate comprehensive EmONC facility , cesarean section rate ( plan emergent ) assessment medical officer non-physician health care provider ultrasound competence training quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cluster-Randomized Trial Ultrasound Use Improve Pregnancy Outcomes Low Income Country Settings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use ultrasound physician non-physician health care staff antenatal identification complicate pregnancy potentially effective intervention ; however , authoritative investigation many low-resource setting need establish potential impact . The investigator propose undertake multi-country , cluster randomize trial assess impact antenatal ultrasound screening perform community physician non-physician health care staff composite outcome consist maternal mortality near miss maternal mortality , stillbirth neonatal mortality low-resource setting . Underpinning objective several assumption . The first assumption ultrasound 's introduction increase antenatal attendance improve outcome due antenatal care alone , great rate institutional delivery . The second assumption ultrasound use lead antenatal detection complicate pregnancy timely appropriate referral complicate pregnancy comprehensive emergency obstetric neonatal care ( EmONC ) facility . Increases antenatal care utilization referral result decrease composite outcome include maternal mortality near miss mortality , stillbirth neonatal death . Secondary outcome evaluate include antenatal attendance rate , institutional delivery rate basic EmONC facility , referral rate comprehensive EmONC facility , cesarean section rate ( plan emergent ) , assessment community physician non-physician health care provider ultrasound train competence cost-effectiveness ultrasound community health facility . The investigator also determine cause non-compliance recommendation referral . In summary , trial evaluate whether train antenatal health care provider perform basic obstetric ultrasonography , use trainee provide routine ultrasound primary care clinic refer appropriately improve pregnancy outcomes low-resource setting . To assess impact ultrasound , investigator propose utilize exist research infrastructure , Global Network Women 's Children 's Health Research ( Global Network ) , currently include 7 site 6 country , India ( 2 ) , Pakistan , Kenya , Zambia , DRC Guatemala . The investigator Global Network ongoing maternal newborn health registry document pregnancy outcomes 6 week post-delivery 100 community . Thus , population-based rate maternal mortality morbidity , stillbirth , neonatal mortality morbidity , well health care utilization , obtain . A sub-set cluster utilized ultrasound trial . RTI International serve data coordinate center Global Network help facilitate design conduct trial , manage trial relate data , provide statistical analysis trial result . GE Healthcare provide ultrasound equipment , also fund University Washington provide train technical support implementation ultrasound community setting . Together , Global Network support University Washington GE Healthcare maximize resource necessary conduct definitive trial potential impact ultrasound reduce maternal newborn mortality maternal morbidity low-resource setting .</detailed_description>
