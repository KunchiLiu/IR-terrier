	<brief_summary>This study patient condition call Interstitial Cystitis , also know Painful Bladder Syndrome . Patients would try least two different therapy , unsuccessfully , ( eg . medication , pelvic floor physical therapy ) The purpose research project study immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporine patient Interstitial Cystitis assess well work , side effect mechanism action . Cyclosporine drug FDA-approved prevent organ rejection kidney , liver , heart transplant approve FDA Interstitial Cystitis . Several research study publish show Cyclosporine improve symptom Interstitial Cystitis , work well placebo ( `` sugar pill '' inert treatment ) work effectively Pentosan Polysulfate ( Elmiron ) , FDA approve therapy . The dose Cyclosporine use study Interstitial Cystitis much low dos use prevent rejection transplant patient . Based study , American Urological Association recently publish treatment guideline recommend Cyclosporine therapy Interstitial Cystitis failure conservative therapy medication . Nevertheless , much know use Cyclosporine therapy Interstitial Cystitis include mechanism action , ideal dose , best monitor side effect particular whether kidney damage occur low dos use study . In study , examine mechanism action , blood urine sample collect , therapy look `` biomarkers '' , chemical substance associate inflammation tissue injury . We also test effect therapy skin sensation pain perception molecule Cyclosporine bind ( calcineurin ) also find nerve conduct pain signal . This study do Cleveland Clinic involve 30 patient Interstitial Cystitis .</brief_summary>
