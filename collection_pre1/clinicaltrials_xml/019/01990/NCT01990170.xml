	<detailed_description>This study attempt follow original cohort patient take part short- mid-term study may mean reduced patient number due inevitable patient death . Kaplan-Meier analysis control . In term patient number , effort make recruit many patient possible increase validity result . This could problem relate death patient also timeframe completion project refusal patient take part . Many patient elderly may want accept invitation come hospital . However , good follow-up rate achieve mid-term study ( around 80 % ) familiarity team aid recruitment patient contact . In order maintain validity reliability study part follow , methodology adopt project similar short-term study term way information gather classification result . This mean comparison two make , similar information available scientifically comparable . There significant intra and/or inter observer/operator variability result ( different user technical ability ultrasound ) collaboration responsible collection data perform diagnostic test do avoid potential problem validity . For reason , assessment perform principal investigator guidance supervision main research nurse responsible data collection previous project . Results study analyse , evaluate disseminate continuation previous short/mid-term study . A possible limitation may patient recollection experience ulcer recurrence may unreliable . This unavoidable problem effort make get accurate account possible participant . There possibility bias long-term follow result likely patient problem treatment result accept offer additional follow-up rather patient fine . However , patient ask would like participate via telephone unwilling come hospital assessment , affect research question 1 .</detailed_description>
