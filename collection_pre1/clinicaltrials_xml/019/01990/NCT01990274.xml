	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two different method intensify tuberculosis ( TB ) case find community . These method involve use mobile clinic reach people TB symptom able readily access clinic service . A standard diagnostics package consist smear microscopy culture ( smear result available next day ) compare novel diagnostics package involve point-of-care sputum GeneXpert MTB/RIF perform mobile conventional clinic ( day result ) , sputum culture , lateral flow urinary lipoarabinomannan ( LAM ) testing ( HIV +ve subject ) . The primary outcome comparison number culture +ve subject TB treatment group end two month . A secondary aim evaluation accuracy feasibility GeneXpert perform mobile clinic . Additional study aim include use chest X-rays obtain study develop validate computer-aided diagnosis ( CAD ) software package TB ( together collaborator Netherlands ) , well establish whether LAM detectable sub-ELISA concentration urine TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Utility Intensified Case Finding Combined With Package Novel TB Diagnostics Using Mobile Clinic Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent advance diagnosis availability effective anti-tuberculous treatment TB remain one world 's devastate infectious disease , global prevalence 14 million 2006 . In high burden community co-localised HIV epidemic , major problem hamper control effort promulgate TB epidemic large reservoir undiagnosed TB disease . This comprise 50 % total TB burden . HIV-infection atypical yet infectious presentation immunity attenuate worsens undetected reservoir . Thus , large case load community access health care late course disease thus ongoing disease transmission within community . If caseload address TB epidemic never control . Intensified case find seek address problem . Intensified case find strategy identify treat people TB seek diagnostic service initiative . By contrast , passive case find able identify people TB present health care facility . In 2008 WHO Stop TB partnership identify intensified case-finding one four core TB prevention strategy necessary meet sixth Millennium Development Goal halve prevalence TB 2015 . To date , number study illustrate success intensified case find increase case-detection rate ( especially HIV-infected population ) shorten time diagnosis thereby limit attendant morbidity mortality . Given importance resource-intensive nature intensify case find essential optimal , operationally feasible cost-effective screening strategy use . To date , screen strategy vary widely across study use combination symptom screening , radiological ( CXR ) microscopy-centre base laboratory diagnostics ( smear microscopy , available cost permitting , TB culture ) . This major shortcoming well establish standard diagnostic tool perform sub-optimally especially high HIV prevalent setting . With recent development number novel TB diagnostic tool superior performance compare conventional modality , potential point-of-care ( POC ) point-of-treatment usage , imperative intensified case-finding strategy review . The 2010 update WHO `` Guidelines intensify tuberculosis case find isoniazid preventive therapy people live HIV resource constrain setting '' recommend use clinical algorithm intensify case find programme adults adolescent live HIV important incremental diagnostic benefit together feasibility cost-effectiveness novel TB diagnostic tool assess use intensified case find programme within context update guideline . In 2009 , Cepheid release Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay , system able deliver answer directly unprocessed sample combine on-board preparation sample real-time PCR le 2 hour . Additionally , Xpert® MTB/RIF Assay allow simultaneous on-demand molecular test detection M.tb RIF resistance . The GeneXpert™ system consist GeneXpert instrument , personal computer disposable fluidic cartridge . The system combine cartridge-based sample preparation amplification detection fully integrate automated nucleic acid analysis instrument . GeneXpert show accurate tool rapid diagnosis tuberculosis smear-positive smear-negative sample ( single Xpert test sensitivity ~ 70 % smear-negative sample . A large demonstration study Gene Xpert base microscopy-centres currently underway preliminary data appear promising . However , GeneXpert technology use part screen strategy intensify case find operational feasible point-of-treatment diagnostic technology base mobile clinic yet assess . In recent review propose urinary LAM useful `` rule '' test TB HIV-infected subject advance immune-suppression . Additionally , recent development point-of-care urine LAM lateral flow strip test - Determine TB® - preliminary result suggest equivalent performance LAM ELISA make appeal diagnostic high HIV prevalence area . A recent study show urine LAM sensitive smear-microscopy ARV clinic-based TB screening study . The use Determine TB® lateral flow strip test study part intensify case find strategy population-based survey . The Determine TB® lateral flow test use screen HIV-infected patient point-of-care within community subsequent TB clinic referral sputum-based diagnostics . The XACT study randomise control study design evaluate impact package novel TB diagnostic tool community use mobile unit compare standard intensive-case find method . The feasibility perform new TB diagnostics point-of-care examine determine proportion patient identify , initiate , complete TB treatment , great compare standard diagnostic arm . Further , cost-effectiveness TB case detect successfully complete treatment study arm also investigate .</detailed_description>
