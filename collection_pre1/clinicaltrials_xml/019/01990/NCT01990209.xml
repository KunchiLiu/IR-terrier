	<brief_summary>The androgen receptor ( AR ) express 70-90 percent primary breast tumor 75 percent breast metastasis . There evidence suggest Androgen Receptor ( AR ) may target patient advanced breast cancer . Breast cancer patient whose tumor express ER , PR HER2 ( triple negative ) option treatment . Orteronel develop endocrine therapy relevant hormone-sensitive cancer prostrate cancer breast cancer . Triple-negative metastatic breast cancer patient AR expression could potentially benefit anti-androgen therapy like orteronel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Orteronel Monotherapy Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer ( MBC ) That Expresses Androgen Receptor ( AR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label multicenter study conduct 2 stage . - Lead-in Phase : The first 6 patient treat evaluated confirm safety feasibility regimen . After 6 patient complete least 4 week treatment , prohibitive toxicity identify , continuous study treatment begin . - Continuous Study Treatment : Patients continue enrol cohort base tumor specificity total 31 patient Cohort 1 ( ER-/PR-/HER2-/AR+ ) 55 patient Cohort 2 ( ER+ and/or PR+/AR+ ) . Patients evaluate every eight week response treatment . All patient respond treatment ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) stable disease ( SD ) continue receive orteronel develop progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
