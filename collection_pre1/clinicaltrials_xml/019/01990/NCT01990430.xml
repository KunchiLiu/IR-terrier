	<brief_summary>Exercise training establish feasible safe intervention neoplastic treatment breast cancer patient . Numerous study show exercise prevent control various treatment-related side effect include functional limitation , physical capacity , anxiety sleep disturbance . In long-term , active life style demonstrate increase survival woman , maintain moderate level exercise per week ( 30 75 minute brisk walk 5 day per week ) . Specifically , active breast cancer survivor 51-85 % low cancer specific mortality 33-82 % low cause mortality . But despite , breast cancer patient reduce physical activity level cancer treatment . In 2010 , roundtable meeting American College Sport Medicine publish guideline cancer survivor , define recommend amount exercise 150 minute per week aerobic exercise moderate-intensity 2 3 day per week strength training include exercise major muscle group . But 30-47 % breast cancer survivor follow exercise recommendation . In clinical setting , information oncologist keep physical active part recommendation . Yet breast cancer patient find difficult begin maintain minimal activity level recommend expert . A typical obstacle include lack direction expert , assure safety feasibility exercise perform . Moreover , important personal aspect major influence exercise preference , include certain food choice dietary intake , education level preference face-to-face exercise counsel professional . A cancer diagnosis recognize `` teachable moment '' , patient particularly motivate lifestyle change . So important approach patient adequate intervention consider different need order get healthy behavior among breast cancer patient . Taking account , hypothesis pilot project guide integrate group exercise program , include educational program healthy life style , increase adherence breast cancer survivor exercise healthy diet . Therefore aim pilot study investigate comprehensive specific group exercise program , include dietary exercise information , could increase leisure-time exercise woman breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study perform collaboration Technical University Madrid ( UPM ) , Spanish Group Cancer Patients ( GEPAC ) , Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón , Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierr Hospital de Sanchinarro-Madrid del Norte . The project carry facility Physical Activity Sport Science Institute ( INEF ) approve Ethical Committee UPM . A single arm pilot project pre-post test design . Intervention The exercise program design conduct qualified exercise physiologist oncologic training . The exercise program consist twice weekly supervised training program develop social framework . The session include instruction train exercise , well included time speak fear doubts patient , situation . The intervention last 12 week ( 24 session ) . The training intensity progressively increase 65 % 85 % heart rate control POLAR FT7 heart rate monitor aerobic activity , 8-15 repetition 2-3 set strength activity . Exercise intensity prescribe use Karvonen equation . Every supervised session structure duration 60 minute . American College Sport Medicine ( ACSM ) Guidelines Cancer Patients follow session design . The first 10 minute dynamic warm combine different way movement around class articular movement . Next part consist aerobic exercise , principal aim practice exercise increase participant 's functional capacity music-based activity aerobic , box-dance global strength circuit without external resistance . Followed upper-limbs strength exercise elastic band improve strength increase arm lean mass , focus chest dorsal exercise . The last part whole-body stretching exercise improve joint mobility muscle flexibility upper body limb , general muscle relaxation training . The exercise program complement theoretical class exercise nutrition . One class exercise prescription hold two month intervention . The patient teach minimum exercise recommend activity could adapt depend situation . The nutrition program consist three theoretical practice class , specific term nutrition diet explain . The first class explain different group nutrient , function organism group aliment obtain . The second class practical class interpret food label relate measurement food portion recommendation healthy diet . Final session speak ten best ten bad aliment , prevent promote cancer . Teachers promote avoid group aliment Mediterranean diet encourage follow .</detailed_description>
