	<brief_summary>We quantify one lipid compound ( 5,6 epoxy eicosatrienoic acid ( 5,6 EET ) , 5,6- EpoxyEicosaTrienoic acid ) colonic biopsy Inflammatory Bowel Disease patient . We evaluate possible use pathological activity biomarker potential therapeutic target . We hypothesize 5,6-EET present human colonic tissue vary quantity depend pathological state IBD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The project exploratory physiopathological/translational pilot study , aim understand relative importance lipid compound , especially 5,6-EET , Inflammatory Bowel Diseases . Using mass spectrometry , 5,6-EET 33 lipid metabolite quantify situ colonic biopsy IBD patient control patient . We compare quantity 5,6-EET inflammatory non-inflammatory zone biopsy IBD patient biopsy control patient . We establish cluster lipid compound associated pathological activity . We determine expose profile receptor lipid mediator express 5,6-EET lipid compound one signalization . All data submit statistical analysis confirm relevance . We expect pilot study help u define 5,6-EET component metabolic family marker IBD activity . It could point lipid mediator receptor potential new therapeutic target . It increase knowledge current treatment efficiency evidence lipid marker inflammatory condition .</detailed_description>
