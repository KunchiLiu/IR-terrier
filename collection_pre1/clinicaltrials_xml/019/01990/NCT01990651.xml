	<brief_title>Study Use CTC NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain common cause cancer mortality world men woman . More half patient diagnose die within first year . Given concern fact , need novel methodology diagnose patient earlier stage disease , accurately predict treatment response / failure predict overall survival . The use CTC investigate show predict progression free survival overall survival metastatic breast cancer , recommend breast cancer tumor marker American Society Clinical Oncology . There also relationships CTC 's survival , show metastatic colorectal prostate cancer . However , CTC 's thoroughly investigate non-small cell lung cancer . This trial ass detection circulate tumor cell could use tool help advance treatment NSCLC patient .</detailed_description>
