	<brief_summary>During laparoscopic surgery , surgeon operate 'keyhole ' incision abdomen . These allow long tools camera pas perform surgery allow surgeon see inside . The camera image see television screen , view , like watch television home , two-dimensional ( 2D ) , form . This make perform laparoscopic surgery challenging , learn appreciate depth perform surgical task . Recent advance view technology mean capability comfortable three-dimensional ( 3D ) view laparoscopic surgery , many center show superiority 2D lab-based experiment . However , technology never compare normal gold standard 2D imaging laparoscopic operation . This study aim investigate whether quantifiable benefit use new 3D image system 2D laparoscopy , hypothesise mark benefit use 3D 2D . Patients place wait list keyhole surgery remove gallbladder invite take part study . If agree , undergo standard operation remove gallbladder plan already . At begin operation randomise ( select chance ) one two group . One group surgery perform current 'Gold standard ' surgeon use 2D camera screen . The group exact operation surgeon use 3D camera screen . The intra-abdominal part operation record view independent observer surgeon , assess technical performance difference operation perform 2D 3D , well time take surgery . There extra risk take part randomise 3D group . The laparoscopic camera size 2D camera use way . There real disadvantage , patient still undergo operation book experience change treatment . The aim compare 2D 3D Day Case Laparoscopic Cholecystectomies , see mark difference new technology . Lab base study imply 3D image system reduce surgical error operate time therefore could improve patient safety . This study may help improve laparoscopic surgery future patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery show improve patient recovery surgical intervention , however significant learn curve . This related technical obstacle need overcome visually , lose depth perception accompany two- dimensional imaging . The advent Robotic Surgery demonstrate technical advantage due wristed instrument three-dimensional imaging ability . The 3D vision stereopsis robot significantly improve surgical performance , independently robotic tool advantage . Early investigator three-dimensional image system versus classical laparoscopic surgery demonstrate significant benefit . This likely related imaging capture projection technology , cause significant discomfort eyestrain operator . In last year , enormous leap world 3D vision technology , associate film industry . Now 3D appreciate mass audience use polarise glass simple wear , without cause intolerable side-effects . The use 3D technology compare classical laparoscopy many lab-based experiment show reduced technical error time skill acquisition trainee . These lab-based test also complete expert surgeon part PhD project undertake previous research fellow , although data unpublished yet , result show 35 % reduction time 60 % reduction error test perform 3D v 2D . It possible 3D image reduce operating time improve patient safety operate theatre . We apply research true operation show whether transference beneficial outcome . With regard surgical error , assessment surgical performance lead several technique validate literature . We intend utilise Human Reliability Analysis tool assessment surgical error . The aim study address whether significant difference performance observe true surgery advance 3D technology . This do objectively assess technical error operative time routine gallbladder operation perform 2D 3D . There pilot study data , use lab-based study basis calculation power number enrol trial .</detailed_description>
