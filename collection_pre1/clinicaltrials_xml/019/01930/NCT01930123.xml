	<detailed_description>Like obesity , NAFLD NASH closely link nutrition `` Western diet '' rich saturate fat refine sugar . Although fat consumption remain relatively stable , marked increase dietary fructose consumption ( double past 30 year alone ) support role fructose NAFLD metabolic syndrome . Although mechanism ( ) fructose-related liver injury yet well define , fructose-related hepatic adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) depletion may contribute liver injury . Observations animal suggest fructose induces metabolic syndrome NAFLD independent energy intake . One key difference fructose metabolism ( oppose glucose ) relate ATP depletion necessity adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) kinase replenish ATP store . As opposed glucose , initial fructose metabolism involve phosphorylation fructose fructose-1-phosphate fructokinase ( ketohexokinase , KHK ) use substrate ATP . Unlike glucokinase , phosphorylation fructose KHK specific fructose rate limit . Replenishment ATP store require phosphorylation AMP back ATP via AMP kinase ( inhibited insulin resistance ( common patient NAFLD ) conversion uric acid via xanthine dehydrogenase result hyperuricemia . The high activity KHK phosphorylating fructose fructose-1-phosphate liver , could result hepatic ATP depletion habitual fructose consumption . Published animal human study support hypothesis fructose risk factor NAFLD NAFLD-related liver disease progression . In animal model , diet high fructose induce feature metabolic syndrome include weight gain , insulin resistance , hypertriglyceridemia , hypertension . Similar effect observe administration simple sugar glucose . Fructose ( sucrose ) administration human also cause feature metabolic syndrome quite typical patient NAFLD . Fructose lipogenic , stimulate triglyceride synthesis cause hepatic steatosis . As previously report animal , group report increase fructose consumption ( assess fructose-containing beverage ) risk factor metabolic syndrome biopsy-proven NAFLD patient NAFLD consume 3-4 time fructose age , gender , mass index ( BMI ) match control without liver disease . In addition increase fructose consumption risk factor NAFLD , fructose implicate NAFLD disease progression . The administration diet 25 % total energy sucrose ( contain 50 % fructose ) result rise liver aminotransferase level within 18 day . This study , perform nearly 25 year ago , alarm current sugar intake Americans range . In study 427 patient biopsy-proven NAFLD , increase consumption fructose-containing beverage univariately associate decrease age ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) , male sex ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) , hypertriglyceridemia ( P &lt; 0.04 ) , low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol ( &lt; 0.0001 ) , decrease serum glucose ( P &lt; 0.001 ) , increase calorie intake ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) , hyperuricemia ( P &lt; 0.0001 ) . After control age , sex , BMI , total calorie intake , daily fructose consumption associate low steatosis grade high fibrosis stage ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . Being triglyceride synthesis require ATP , hypothesize low hepatic steatosis may reflect deceased ATP availability . Additionally , old adult ( age ≥ 48 year ) , daily fructose consumption associate increase hepatic inflammation ( P &lt; 0.05 ) , hepatocyte ballooning ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . However , mechanism ( ) fructose cause liver injury remain unknown . In support hypothesis ATP depletion underlies liver injury patient NAFLD , group demonstrate patient biopsy-proven NAFLD increase hepatic mRNA expression KHK compare match control . Indeed , human pilot study , intravenous ( IV ) fructose administration associate hepatic ATP depletion assess 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . Reduced hepatic ATP store prevalent overweight obese subject lean subject . Furthermore , recovery fructose-induced ATP depletion find delayed patient NAFLD ( n=8 ) . However , limitation exist work small sample size inability ass cause-effect relationship ( ) BMI , NAFLD , energy homeostasis , histologic feature liver injury . In liver cell , ATP depletion could perpetuate chronic liver injury make fatty hepatocytes less proliferative . Hepatic ATP depletion also encourage expansion liver progenitor population , cause arrest protein synthesis , induce inflammatory prooxidative change , increase endoplasmic reticulum stress , promote activation stress-related kinase , induces mitochondrial dysfunction , increase apoptotic activity . This support data suggests fructose may associate NAFLD , NASH , progressive fibrosis . Further , study Loguercio et al . demonstrate increase uric acid level basal level IV fructose infusion significantly high ( p &lt; 0.01 ) patient cirrhosis ( 3 mg/dl ) NASH ( 1.9 mg/dl ) healthy control ( 1.2 mg/dl ) . This effect completely reverse fructose 1,6-diphosphate could replenish ability resynthesize ATP ADP . Therefore , IV fructose challenge could effectively differentiate healthy subject , chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis . NAFLD lack accurate robust non-invasive biomarkers grade stage histologic disease activity . This critical barrier understand influence important environmental risk factor ( increased/habitual fructose consumption ) pathogenesis progression NAFLD . Currently , reliable assessment NAFLD require liver biopsy interpretation histology . Serum aminotransferase level conventional image method detect liver fat grade stage NAFLD . Furthermore , current development biomarker cross-sectional nature characterize dynamic change underlie liver injury patient NAFLD . In vivo 31P MRS permit evaluation dynamic change individual phosphorus-containing metabolite liver parenchyma , phosphomonoester ( PME ) , ATP , inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) . Intravenous fructose load alters phosphorus metabolite allow assessment liver function 31P MRS. Other investigator demonstrate fructose loading could use effectively tool investigate change metabolic step hepatic metabolism human alcohol-related liver disease . Further , IV fructose load cause significantly high ATP degradation uric acid production cirrhotic patient healthy control . The association fructose , increase uric acid , hepatic ATP depletion previously describe . Increased uric acid independent risk factor NAFLD keep hypothesis , hyperuricemia may surrogate marker impaired hepatic energy homeostasis patient NAFLD . The propose mechanism fructose-related hepatic ATP depletion , NAFLD , NASH associate hyperuricemia depict Figure 1 novel , innovative , scientifically rigorous address important public health concern—the impact fructose rise epidemic NAFLD .</detailed_description>
