	<brief_summary>The aim study document immunogenicity safety VRVg pre-exposure regimen healthy child adolescent age 2 17 year . Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate VRVg non-inferior Imovax® Rabies term proportion subject achieve rabies virus neutralize antibody ( RVNA ) titer ≥ 0.5 international unit ( IU ) /mL D42 , i.e . 14 day last vaccination . - To describe least 99 % subject achieve RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL D42 low bound 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) least 97 % , VRVg group . Secondary Objectives : - To assess clinical safety vaccine vaccine injection administer pre-exposure schedule . - To describe immune response induce vaccine 14 day last vaccination , i.e . D42 , 6 month first vaccination - To describe geometric mean titer ratio two vaccine group D42 , i.e . 14 day last vaccination .</brief_summary>
