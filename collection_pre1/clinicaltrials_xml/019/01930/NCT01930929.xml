	<brief_summary>The number obese increase rapidly . Bariatric surgery use great great extent treatment obesity obtain great permanent weight loss . The currently commonly use surgical method gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , far prove effective way achieve great permanent weight loss , reduction maybe even elimination many obesity-related health complication ( diabetes , sleep apnea , pain due osteoarthrosis etc. ) . Bariatric surgery , include RYGB also associate medical nutritional complication . This natural consequence fact food bypass virtually entire ventricle 100-150 cm upper part small intestine RYGB . Therefore , problem uptake example B12 , iron , folate , thiamin , fat-soluble vitamin ( Vitamins A , D , E K ) copper , zinc selenium expect . In light , decide RYGB operate patient must take vitamin B12 , iron vitamin D substitution . In spite , many develop various nutritional problem RYGB . In addition nutritional complication complication hypoglycaemia gallstone attack RYGB . Nevertheless comprehensive inventory occurrence nutritional complication bariatric surgery neither Denmark international context . Thus consensus optimal postoperative prevention complication . An overview occurrence problem important assess determine indication bariatric surgery well optimize prevention complication . To enlighten conduct cohort study complication investigate hospitalization death RYGB .

	<brief_title>Prevalence Complications After Bariatric Surgery - Epidemiologic Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Prevalence overweight obesity increase Denmark country , conventional treatment obesity lifestyle change ( hypocaloric diet , physical activity behavior modification ) rarely lead large sustained weight loss , surprise bariatric surgery take treatment severe case obesity . Weight loss great treatment , importantly relatively large weight loss permanent . Positive effect gastric bypass The currently commonly use surgical method gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , proven highly effective method achieve great permanent weight loss approximately 30-40 % reduction weight , equivalent 40-60 % reduction overweight.Moreover RYGB show provide complete remission prior type 2 diabetes 80 % case short observation time ( 2 year surgery ) 50 % remission long time follow-up ( &gt; 5 year ) . Moreover data suggest RYGB reduce consumption antihypertensive drug 51 % lipid-lowering drug 59 % . Psychiatric complication gastric bypass There conflict result literature examine consumption antidepressant . Some study find reduced consumption antidepressant bariatric surgery within first two year , others show consumption almost unchanged overall cohort follow-up study show increase quality life . Nevertheless , increase incidence suicide bariatric surgery , argue unambiguous improvement psychological well-being . Nutritional complication gastric bypass Bariatric surgery include RYGB also connect medical nutritional effect complication . This surprising since RYGB `` bypass '' virtually entire ventricle 100-150 cm upper part small intestine , problem inclusion , example B12 , iron , folate , thiamin , fat-soluble vitamin ( Vitamin A , D , E K ) copper , zinc selenium expect . Therefore , recommend RYGB operate patient substitute vitamin B12 , iron vitamin D. Despite many develop various nutritional problem RYGB long term result irreversible neurological damage , osteoporosis anemia . Such complication sparsely register Denmark . The complication often develop long time operation , time patient longer follow specialized department report complication Danish Obesity Register , way surgical complication report . There international consensus postoperative vitamin substitution , may due previous lack evidence nutritional complication . Surgical complication gastric bypass International study show mortality bariatric surgery range 0.24 2.77 % depend operator hospital , perioperative morbidity range 6.92 8.85 % also depend operator hospital . Moreover complication abdominal pain vary degree development gallstone frequently see . It still unresolved extensive problem nutritional complication bariatric surgery Denmark , want clarify occurrence complication Denmark . This provide overview positive well negative impact bariatric surgery thus decisive ass determine indication bariatric surgery well optimize prevention complication . The investigator project make cohort study RYGB operate patient Central Denmark Region North Denmark Region period 2006 - 2011 ( 5000 patient ) include combination various register ( see research plan ) able estimate e.g . mortality , readmission surgical department ( reoperations ) , length stay surgical department / intensive care unit length patient follow-up medical context , referral readmission medical ward , The purpose cohort study describe prognosis patient RYGB Central North Denmark Region 2006-2011 . The specific objective compare Danish data occurrence complication beneficial effect RYGB international data order demonstrate quality RYGB make Denmark . The investigator examine : Mortality RYGB surgery ( 30-day mortality , 90-day mortality total follow-up period : 2-7 year surgery ) b Surgical complication RYGB study anastomosis ulcer , bowel obstruction , ileus / internal herniation , peritonitis , gallstone , kidney stone , abdominal pain infection . c Consumption drug two year lead surgery compare consumption 2-7 year RYGB . Here focus consumption antidiabetic , antihypertensive , statin , aspirin , antidepressant analgetics prescription illuminate psychological , medical nutritional complication follow RYGB . Thus , investigator wish achieve good documentation positive effect RYGB ( weight loss , remission diabetes , quality life , etc . ) negative health effect ( mortality , surgical nutritional ) order provide well found approach form treatment . Method The investigator include RYGB-operated person period 2006-2011 residing Central Denmark Region ( CDR ) North Denmark Region ( NDR ) . These patient ' social security number provide CDR NDR ( agree ) . This consider total approximately 5,000 people ( 3,300 CDR approximately 2,000 RN ) . The variable investigator want focus relation epidemiologic study : 1 . Mortality bariatric surgery : Information death cause death provide relevant registry ( The Danish Register Causes Death etc. ) . 2 . Surgical complication bariatric surgery : Surgical hospital readmission bariatric surgery diagnosis relate original obesity surgery . 3 . The investigator use data The Danish National Database Reimbursed Prescriptions consumption prescription drug group people antidiabetic , vitamin substitution B12/thiamin , iron supplement antidepressant . As control group use consumption drug sex age match group . Based data data directly The National Bariatric Surgery Register get overview possible predictor complication RYGB age , gender , preoperative BMI , previous gastric band surgery preoperative comorbidity . The investigator conduct stratify analysis data people Central Denmark Region involve second subproject . This part project carry close collaboration Department Clinical Epidemiology Aarhus University Hospital , access necessary database . Statistical consideration power calculation In cohort study , investigator expect cohort approximately 5000 patient . The statistical evaluation data perform collaboration Department Clinical Epidemiology , Aarhus University Hospital . There conducted statistical analysis identify possible predictor complication RYGB BMI surgery , age , comorbidity , etc . Statistical analysis carry philosophiae doctor ( PhD ) student . Description participant We include patient undergone gastric bypass surgery Central Denmark Region North Denmark Region year 2006-2011 ( 5000 patient ) . Risks , side effect disadvantage There consider risk , side effect disadvantage associate participation epidemiological study . Respect subject ' physical mental integrity The project approve Danish Data Protection Agency ( . 1-16-02-153-13 ) The Act Processing Personal Data respect . The study also report Clinical Trials conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration II . Publication result Both positive , negative inconclusive result publish sought publish English-language , peer-reviewed journal original publication PhD student first author . Perspectives The investigator expect identify positive negative consequence RYGB thus optimize basis patient physicians future able decide surgery . This also good prevention complication thus save patient community loss , economic well social personal . The project hopefully form basis continuation longer follow-up study . Moreover , result set stage development new `` gentle '' obesity surgery .</detailed_description>
