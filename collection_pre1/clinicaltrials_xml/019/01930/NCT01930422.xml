	<brief_summary>The primary purpose protocol evaluate effect repeat application 5 consecutive day real tDCS compare application placebo tDCS ( sham procedure ) evolution tobacco consumption short term Day 1 Day 5 . The study hypothesis repeat application 5 consecutive day real tDCS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex region reduce crave induced causing decrease daily tobacco consumption Day 1 Day 5 persist final visit Day 15 Day 20 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) Tobacco Consumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking major public health problem lead cause preventable death world . Care include education , psychotherapy treatment , despite therapeutic , smoke cessation process often characterize relapse . The main risk factor relapse craving . Neurophysiological study provide evidence understand crave . This crave involve surface structure include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , accessible neurostimulation . Repetitive neurostimulation applies structure involve craving could therefore modulate . Two non-invasive stimulation technique exist : repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . The choice tDCS base ease use , excellent tolerance , good quality placebo low cost .</detailed_description>
