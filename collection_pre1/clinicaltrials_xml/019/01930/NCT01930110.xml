	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The objective compare efficacy single-hormone closed-loop strategy dual-hormone closed-loop strategy regulate glucose level continuous exercise interval exercise . The investigator hypothesize dual-hormone closed-loop strategy superior single-hormone closed-loop strategy regulate glucose level exercise period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . We aim conduct randomized two-way cross-over trial compare single-hormone closed-loop strategy dual-hormone closed-loop strategy compare two intervention exercise period adult type 1 diabetes . A moderate intensity exercise perform 60 minute 60 % maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) . A high intensity exercise 40 minute interval training . The interval training precede 10 minute warm-up follow 10 minute cool .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female ≥ 18 year old . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year . The subject insulin pump therapy least 3 month . Last ( less 3 month ) HbA1c ≤ 12 % . Clinically significant microvascular complication : nephropathy ( estimate glomerular filtration rate 40 ml/min ) , neuropathy ( especially diagnose gastroparesis ) severe proliferative retinopathy judge investigator . Recent ( &lt; 3 month ) acute macrovascular event e.g . acute coronary syndrome cardiac surgery . Ongoing pregnancy . Severe hypoglycemic episode within two week screen . Other serious medical illness likely interfere study participation ability complete exercise period judgment investigator ( e.g . orthopedic limitation ) . Failure comply team 's recommendation ( e.g . willing eat snack , willing change pump parameter , etc ) . Problems venous access</criteria>
