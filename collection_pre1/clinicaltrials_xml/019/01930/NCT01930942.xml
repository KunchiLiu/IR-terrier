	<brief_title>Genetic Profile Predicting Sensibility Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy Locally Advanced Rectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For locally advanced rectal carcinoma , preoperative chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) achieve similar overall survival well local control compare postoperative therapy , consider one standard therapy patients.But , every one cure , possible reason difference gene expression mutation status among patients.So , perform trial study relationship genetic factor response preoperative CRT locally advance rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
