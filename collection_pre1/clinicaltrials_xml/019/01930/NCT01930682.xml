	<brief_title>Early Routine Catheterisation After Alteplase Fibrinolysis vs. Primary PCI Acute ST-elevation Myocardial Infarct</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) prefer reperfusion therapy patient acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . However , patient receive timely fashion result delay associate patient transfer catheterization team mobilization . In China , many hospital still lack PCI facility nowadays . Even large city , patient high chance presenting hospital provide around-the-clock staffing.In contrast , intravenous thrombolysis administer many eligible patient . The advantages fibrinolysis include easy administration , wide-spread availability early patency infarct-related artery ( IRA ) .According investigation carry 2001 2004 , 52.5 % patient STEMI receive thrombolytic therapy initial treatment China . In previous trial , full-dose tenecteplase follow angioplasty safe produce good earlier myocardial perfusion primary angioplasty , demonstrate presence high rate ST-segment normalization immediately coronary revascularization well angiographic reperfusion parameter group.Pilot study ( EARLY-PCI ) early routine PCI alteplase fibrinolysis acute myocardial infarction patient perform investigator also demonstrate therapy early routine PCI recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator ( rtPA ) thrombolysis safe effective treatment method Chinese STEMI patient . Based result two study , implies early routine PCI rtPA thrombolysis may alternative choice patient would time delay medical contact PCI . And date , evidence compare efficacy safety early PCI alteplase fibrinolysis primary PCI patient China.For reason , plan carry open , control , randomize trial patient STEMI ass whether routine early post alteplase fibrinolysis angioplasty lead great degree myocardial salvage clinical outcome compare primary angioplasty among chinese patient expect time delay primary PCI .</detailed_description>
