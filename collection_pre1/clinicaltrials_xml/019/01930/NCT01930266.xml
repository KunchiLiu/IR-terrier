	<brief_summary>Diet source calcium important dietary source dairy product . This present difficulty child IgE-mediated cow 's milk allergy , unable consume milk . We note IgE-CMA allergic young adult significant decrease bone mineral density ( BMD ) compare international reference value also geographically age match normal control . Working hypothesis : Young adult IgE-CMA significantly low BMD age gender match control . This reverse introduce dairy product follow recovery allergy , enrich diet via calcium source .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Young Adults With Life Threatening Cow 's Milk Allergy : Risks Decrease Bone Mineralization Methods Calcium Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study 1 . To study prevalence severity reduce BMD among IgE-CMA allergy patient 2. estimate potential recovery reduce BMD administration milk oral immunotherapy . 3 . To determine efficacy intervention ( non-dairy ) calcium enrich diet IgE-CMA young adult , utilize several method direct compliance . Methods : We study bone mineral content ( BMC ) , BMD , serum value bone turnover factor , dietary lifestyle questionnaires 150 post pubertal IgE-CMA patient history dairy consumption 150 age gender match normal control . Separately , compare value patient former IgE-CMA patient ingest milk recovery allergy . Finally , examine effect include non-dairy dietary source calcium IgE-CMA patient , different group receive different degree interventional guidance . The study provide insight bone health CMA patient , provide guidance effective dietary treatment implementation . Furthermore , important nutritional data best method intervention reduce osteoporosis likely learnt , far reach ramification , particular population , osteoporosis patient , large .</detailed_description>
