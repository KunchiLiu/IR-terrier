This study may treat approximately 500 subject 50 active site U.S . Subjects follow three ( 3 ) year . Subjects stratify one ( 1 ) three ( 3 ) arm base degree calcification coronary lesion define protocol . An interim analysis standard care treatment use perform arm 40 subject complete discharge visit . The duration study expect approximately four ( 4 ) year .</detailed_description>
