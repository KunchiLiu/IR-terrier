	<brief_title>Circulating Tumor Cells Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The lack tumor tissue drug target biomarker study significantly limit development novel treatment advance HCC . In recent year , circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) show important prognostic biomarkers overall survival patient breast , prostate , colorectal cancer anti-cancer therapy . Methods Materials : This project plan enroll 50 HCC patient receive curative surgery radiofrequency ablation therapy , 50 patient receive trans-arterial chemoembolization , 50 patient receive systemic therapy National Taiwan University Hospital 24 month CTCs analysis . The eligible patient receive blood test anti-cancer therapy . The blood sample separate blood cell plasma . Blood cell use isolation enumeration CTCs . Plasma use extract DNA measure molecular aberration ( gene mutation related hepatocarcinogenesis response HCC cell molecular target therapy ) 1. explore correlation CTCs number clinical characteristic HCC patient different stage ; 2. compare pattern molecular aberration CTC HCC tumor tissue HCC patient archival tumor tissue available ; 3. measure change CTCs number molecular aberration HCC patient molecular target therapy .</detailed_description>
