	<brief_summary>Ticagrelor first line therapy along aspirin patient undergo primary PCI STEMI . However , many patient still treat fibrinolytic therapy safety efficacy Ticagrelor investigate patient population . The present study propose study safety efficacy Ticagrelor patient undergo PCI post fibrinolytic therapy STEMI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor PCI Post Thrombolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new antiplatelet agent Ticagrelor demonstrate superiority Clopidogrel patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . At present Ticagrelor remain first line therapy adjunct aspirin patient undergoing primary PCI STEMI reduce major adverse event . However , safety efficacy Ticagrelor investigate patient STEMI post fibrinolysis . Ticagrelor result significantly high platelet inhibition aspirin clopidogrel may expose patient increase risk bleeding administer post thrombolysis . However , fibrinolytic therapy result prothrombotic milieu great activation platelet , condition balance addition strong antiplatelet agent . Similar concern initially reflect clopidogrel adjunct fibrinolytic therapy later proven unsubstantiated . In fact , adjunct administration clopidogrel fibrinolytic therapy reduces major adverse event show multiple study become standard care recommend guideline . The present study propose study safety efficacy Ticagrelor patient undergo PCI post fibrinolytic therapy STEMI .</detailed_description>
