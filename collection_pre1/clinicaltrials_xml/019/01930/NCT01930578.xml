	<brief_title>Bioimpedance Spectroscopy Humans During Acute Fluid Volume Expansion With Different Crystalloid Solutions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The resistance human body flow alternate current think related volume fluid within body . The acute change fluid status human body alters body resistance . This change measure accurately bioelectrical impedance previous experiment confirm observation . However , previous experiment use piglet model subsequently human , suggest change observe result change salt instead body water . An experiment show bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) able detect change total body resistance different electrolyte solution infuse . The change resistance relate change osmolarity electro-ionic state , volume water infuse . Therefore , BIA measure principally electro-ionic state . Thus measurement fluid volume indirectly obtain BIA . However , non-steady state acute fluid volume expansion , measurement water volume perform accurately . In study , administer sodium bromide oder measure extracellular water via bromide solution technique . Despite interesting observation , human study describe underpowered . Therefore , aim validate observation previously make carry appropriately power study adequate sample size validate observation note .</detailed_description>
