	<brief_summary>The number obese increase rapidly . Bariatric surgery use great great extent treatment obesity obtain great permanent weight loss . The currently commonly use surgical method gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , far prove effective way achieve great permanent weight loss , reduction maybe even elimination many obesity-related health complication ( diabetes , sleep apnea , pain due osteoarthrosis etc. ) . Bariatric surgery , include RYGB also associate medical nutritional complication . This natural consequence fact food bypass virtually entire ventricle 100-150 cm upper part small intestine RYGB . Therefore , problem uptake example B12 , iron , folate , thiamin , fat-soluble vitamin ( Vitamins A , D , E K ) copper , zinc selenium expect . In light , decide RYGB operate patient must take vitamin B12 , iron vitamin D substitution . In spite , many develop various nutritional problem RYGB . In addition nutritional complication complication hypoglycaemia gallstone attack RYGB . Nevertheless comprehensive inventory occurrence nutritional complication bariatric surgery neither Denmark international context . Thus consensus optimal postoperative prevention complication . An overview occurrence problem important assess determine indication bariatric surgery well optimize prevention complication . To enlighten conduct questionnaire survey complication pain , dump hypoglycemia RYGB . Moreover quality life RYGB operation . We invite 3500 RYGB operate patient Central Denmark Region operate 2006-2011 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complications After Bariatric Surgery Based , Questionnaire Survey</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Prevalence overweight obesity increase Denmark country , conventional treatment obesity lifestyle change ( hypocaloric diet , physical activity behavior modification ) rarely lead large sustained weight loss , surprise bariatric surgery take treatment severe case obesity . Weight loss great treatment , importantly relatively large weight loss permanent . Positive effect gastric bypass The currently commonly use surgical method gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , proven highly effective method achieve great permanent weight loss approximately 30-40 % reduction weight , equivalent 40-60 % reduction overweight . Moreover RYGB show provide complete remission prior type 2 diabetes 80 % case short observation time ( 2 year surgery ) 50 % remission long time follow-up ( &gt; 5 year ) . Moreover data suggest RYGB reduce consumption antihypertensive drug 51 % lipid-lowering drug 59 % . Psychiatric complication gastric bypass There conflict result literature examine consumption antidepressant . Some study find reduced consumption antidepressant bariatric surgery within first two year , others show consumption almost unchanged overall cohort follow-up study show increase quality life . Nevertheless , increase incidence suicide bariatric surgery , argue unambiguous improvement psychological well-being . Nutritional complication gastric bypass Bariatric surgery include RYGB also connect medical nutritional effect complication . This surprising since RYGB `` bypass '' virtually entire ventricle 100-150 cm upper part small intestine , problem inclusion , example B12 , iron , folate , thiamin , fat-soluble vitamin ( Vitamin A , D , E K ) copper , zinc selenium expect . Therefore , recommend RYGB operate patient substitute vitamin B12 , iron vitamin D. Despite many develop various nutritional problem RYGB long term result irreversible neurological damage , osteoporosis anemia . Such complication sparsely register Denmark . The complication often develop long time operation , time patient longer follow specialized department report complication Danish Obesity Register , way surgical complication report . There international consensus postoperative vitamin substitution , may due previous lack evidence nutritional complication . Other classic side effect early late dumping , manifest weakness meal symptom moderate degree low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) . Frequent bowel movement expect result GYP , patient much hamper daily activity . Surgical complication gastric bypass International study show mortality bariatric surgery range 0.24 2.77 % depend operator hospital , perioperative morbidity range 6.92 8.85 % also depend operator hospital . Moreover complication abdominal pain vary degree development gallstone frequently see . Moreover complication abdominal pain vary degree development gallstone frequently see . It still unresolved extensive problem nutritional complication bariatric surgery Denmark , want clarify occurrence complication Denmark . This provide overview positive well negative impact bariatric surgery thus decisive ass determine indication bariatric surgery well optimize prevention complication . In project make questionnaire survey GYP patient Central Denmark Region period 2006 - 2011 ( 3500 people ) receive invitation participate . This part include thus measurement self-reported complication would otherwise detected register record , measurement quality life GYP The purpose follow : 1 . To describe serious complication ( readmission , reoperations etc ) related complication GYP 2 . To estimate incidence ( prevalence ) common nutritional complication GYP Denmark 3 . To estimate incidence ( prevalence ) neurological complication GYP Denmark 4 . To describe quality life patient undergone GYP include improvement disease ( e.g . diabetes , sleep apnea , joint pain ) GYP . Thus , investigator wish achieve good documentation positive effect GYP ( weight loss , remission diabetes , quality life , etc . ) negative health effect ( mortality , surgical nutritional ) order provide well found approach form treatment . Method From Central Denmark Region , investigator obtain social security number gastric bypass operate person Central Denmark Region ( approximately 3500 patient ) . From State Serum Institute obtain information address social security number invite letter participate survey . The letter contain number questionnaire hence answer anonymous . The questionnaire include question relate weight loss , surgical complication , possible remission diabetes , substitution treatment , nutritional complication , hypoglycaemia , quality life ( SF-12 ) , etc . Data questionnaire enter electronically conduct statistical analysis base patient ' response . Prior publication questionnaire conduct pilot project small group participant . Statistical consideration power calculation In questionnaire survey investigator expect cohort approximately 3500 patient . Here perform overall statement self-reported complication , quality life symptom dump partially base validated scale partly questionnaire design specifically study . Risks , side effect disadvantage In questionnaire survey , participation neither associated risk , side effect disadvantage apart small time consumption associate complete questionnaire . Respect subject ' physical mental integrity The project report region 's joint notification Danish Dataprotection Agency . We hereby declare project carry accordance protocol applicable regulatory / legislative . The Act Processing Personal Data respect . The study also report Clinical Trials conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration II . Publication result Both positive , negative inconclusive result publish sought publish English-language , peer-reviewed journal original publication PhD student first author . Perspectives The investigator expect identify positive negative consequence GYP thus optimize basis patient physicians future able decide surgery . This also good prevention complication thus save patient community loss , economic well social personal . The project hopefully form basis continuation longer follow-up study . Moreover , result set stage development new `` gentle '' obesity surgery .</detailed_description>
