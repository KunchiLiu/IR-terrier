	<brief_summary>Oral anticoagulant vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) use many year treatment thromboembolic disorder , among costly disease term public health resource . According Agence française de sécurité sanitaire de produits de santé ( AFSSAPS ) , estimate 900,000 number patient treat VKA 2008 ( 1 % French population ) . VKA origin many adverse effect , give narrow therapeutic window . They cause death approximately 5000 patient per year . The use therapy priority axis reflection Haute Autorité de Santé . The interregion G4 ( Nord Pas de Calais , Normandy , Picardy ) , 9 million people , particularly affect problem . University hospital interregion , give substantial regional referral activity , actually involved manage VKA adverse side effect . Elderly population constitutes majority prescription . The main objective study compare INR people older 75 year measure traditional method measure capillary method INRatio2 supply . The secondary objective show measure affect presence absence anti-phospholipid antibody , probably prevalent elderly , well test variability INR measurement different hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adverse effect oral anticoagulant ( warfarin , fluindione mainly ) bleed complication concern 13 % hospitalization , approximately 17,000 admission per year . They constitute 12.3 % iatrogenic adverse effect accord late result survey conduct haute autorité de santé ( HAS ) . A study realize 2000 , 2976 patient , show 28.8 % patient outside therapeutic range ( &lt; 2 &gt; 4.5 ) . In 2003 , third french biologist knowledge indication VKA treatment patient INR measurement , fifty percent 2000 . When therapeutic range know , value INR remain outside 30 % case . The median time INR equilibration phase 5 6 day , recommend time 2 4 day . A quarter patient phase equilibrium treatment measure INR least month . Followed period year , patient spend 40 % time value INR outside therapeutic range , high-risk area recurrent thrombosis hemorrhage . That require regular monitoring INR . Currently , monitor do blood sample analyze laboratory accord standard technique . The use INR measurement capillary method provide result le 3 minute . This also allow development different monitoring strategy . In context self-monitoring measure , patient performs test use device therapeutic adjustment make health care professional . Data analysis HAS show use self-measurement device significantly improve time spend therapeutic range , reduce risk major bleed accident major thromboembolism . The pathology treat VKA common elderly . They also vulnerable fall , overdose treatment pharmacokinetics amend polypharmacy , malnutrition , less protein binding . The relative risk bleed multiplicated two beyond 70 year . Despite emergence new anticoagulant prevention complication arrhythmia ( disorder affect nearly 10 % population age 80 year ) , VKA remain prevalent new drug renal elimination monitor , dialysable , antidote represent daily cost 30 time VKA . The question use device self-measurement INR elderly particularly timely , population never , knowledge , specific evaluation technique . Elderly population would derive great benefit system significantly improve time spend therapeutic range , reduce risk bleed thromboembolic event reduce INR fluctuation . We build multicenter study whose main objective demonstrate concordance INR measurement capillary way ( INRatio2 ® , SAS ALERE , Jouy-en-Josas ) venous technical reference . It concern patient old 75 year treat VKA hospitalize Internal Medicine , Geriatrics Vascular Medicine fours university hospital G4 region . The secondary objective estimate prevalence antiphospholipid antibody ( range 12 55 % depend study ) influence measurement INR capillary method variability INR veinous measurement function hospital , centralize INR measurement allow compare . 150 patient require perform study .</detailed_description>
