	<brief_summary>The number obese increase rapidly . Bariatric surgery use great great extent treatment obesity obtain great permanent weight loss . The currently commonly use surgical method gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , far prove effective way achieve great permanent weight loss , reduction maybe even elimination many obesity-related health complication ( diabetes , sleep apnea , pain due osteoarthrosis etc. ) . Bariatric surgery , include RYGB also associate medical nutritional complication . This natural consequence fact food bypass virtually entire ventricle 100-150 cm upper part small intestine RYGB . Therefore , problem uptake example B12 , iron , folate , thiamin , fat-soluble vitamin ( Vitamins A , D , E K ) copper , zinc selenium expect . In light , decide RYGB operate patient must take vitamin B12 , iron vitamin D substitution . In spite , many develop various nutritional problem RYGB . In addition nutritional complication complication hypoglycaemia gallstone attack RYGB . Nevertheless comprehensive inventory occurrence nutritional complication bariatric surgery neither Denmark international context . Thus consensus optimal postoperative prevention complication . An overview occurrence problem important assess determine indication bariatric surgery well optimize prevention complication . To enlighten investigator conduct clinical trial concern complication RYGB . The investigator examine 350 RYGB operate patient Central Denmark Region . From medical interview , blood test , Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry etc . possible give good estimate incidence medical complication . The investigator explore complication : anemia , hypoglycemia , peripheral nerve problem ( especially neuropathy ) , vitamin D / osteoporosis mineral / vitamin deficiency may identify blood test . A control group 30-40 age , sex body mass index match individual go examination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Prevalence overweight obesity increase Denmark country , conventional treatment obesity lifestyle change ( hypocaloric diet , physical activity behavior modification ) rarely lead large sustained weight loss , surprise bariatric surgery take treatment severe case obesity . Weight loss great treatment , importantly relatively large weight loss permanent . The currently commonly use surgical method gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , proven highly effective method achieve great permanent weight loss approximately 30-40 % reduction weight , equivalent 40-60 % reduction overweight . Moreover RYGB show provide complete remission prior type 2 diabetes 80 % case short observation time ( 2 year surgery ) 50 % remission long time follow-up ( &gt; 5 year ) . Moreover data suggest GRYGB reduce consumption antihypertensive drug 51 % lipid-lowering drug 59 % . International study show mortality bariatric surgery range 0.24 2.77 % depend operator hospital , perioperative morbidity range 6.92 8.85 % also depend operator hospital . There conflict result literature examine consumption antidepressant . Some study find reduced consumption antidepressant bariatric surgery within first two year , others show consumption almost unchanged overall cohort follow-up study show increase quality life . Nevertheless , increase incidence suicide bariatric surgery , argue unambiguous improvement psychological well-being . Bariatric surgery include RYGB also connect medical nutritional effect complication . This surprising since RYGB `` bypass '' virtually entire ventricle 100-150 cm upper part small intestine , problem inclusion , example B12 , iron , folate , thiamin , fat-soluble vitamin ( Vitamin A , D , E K ) copper , zinc selenium expect . Therefore , recommend RYGB operate patient substitute vitamin B12 , iron vitamin D. Despite many develop various nutritional problem RYGB , sparsely registered Denmark . The complication often develop long time operation , time patient longer follow specialized department report complication Danish Obesity Register , way surgical complication report . There international consensus postoperative vitamin substitution , may due previous lack evidence nutritional complication . This long term result irreversible neurological damage , osteoporosis anemia . Other classic side effect early late dumping , manifest weakness meal symptom moderate degree low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) . Frequent bowel movement expect result RYGB , patient much hamper daily activity . Moreover complication abdominal pain vary degree development gallstone frequently see . It still unresolved extensive problem nutritional complication bariatric surgery Denmark , want clarify occurrence complication Denmark . This provide overview positive well negative impact bariatric surgery thus decisive ass determine indication bariatric surgery well optimize prevention complication . The investigator project make clinical trial randomly select group approximately 350 person period 2006-2011 , RYGB Central Region Denmark . From medical interview , blood test , etc . investigator able give good estimate incidence medical complication . The investigator explore complication : anemia , hypoglycemia , peripheral nerve problem ( especially neuropathy ) , vitamin D / osteoporosis mineral / vitamin deficiency may identify blood test . Thus , investigator wish achieve good documentation positive effect GYP ( weight loss , remission diabetes , quality life , etc . ) negative health effect ( mortality , surgical nutritional ) order provide well found approach form treatment . Method Of patient respond questionnaire second part project 450 select randomly participate clinical trial , consist thorough medical interview physical examination include neurological examination perform physician . On suspicion neurological complication neurological examination perform neurological specialist . This part conduct cooperation Neurology Department , Aarhus University Hospital . There take blood sample participant include potassium , sodium , creatinine , fast glucose , hemoglobin A1c , albumin , calcium , 25-OH vitamin D , PTH , Î²-carotene , vitamin A ( retinol ) , vitamin K ( phytomenadione ) , pp , copper , zinc selenium , iron , hemoglobin , ferritin , leukocytes , liver count , blood urine investigation bone turnover . In addition , patient DXA scan assessment bone mineral content composition . To get appropriate control group , age / gender / BMI match control group also establish people RYGB operate , control group 30-40 people undergo exactly examination RYGB group . Statistical consideration power calculation In clinical trial enroll approximately 350 patient . Due practical financial constraint , maximum number participant possible examine since undergo thorough individual examination . Description participant In study investigator invite 350 patient undergone gastric bypass gastric bypass surgery patient Central Denmark Region participate . In addition healthy control group consist 30 40 age- , gender-and BMI-matched individual undergone RYGB examine clinically . This part project carry cooperation Endocrinology Metabolism Department , Viborg Regional Hospital . Risks , side effect disadvantage The investigator make physical examination , blood test Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry rare case create risk cause side effect subject . This little risk largely offset valuable knowledge achieve . Respect subject ' physical mental integrity The project report region 's joint notification The Danish Data Protection Agency . We hereby declare project carry accordance protocol applicable regulatory / legislative . The study approve The Regional Committee Biomedical Research Ethics Central Denmark Region . The Act Processing Personal Data respect . The study also report The Clinical Trials conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration II . Publication result Both positive , negative inconclusive result publish sought publish English-language , peer-reviewed journal original publication PhD student first author . Perspectives The investigator expect identify positive negative consequence RYGB thus optimize basis patient physicians future able decide surgery . This also good prevention complication thus save patient community loss , economic well social personal . The project hopefully form basis continuation longer follow-up study . Moreover , result set stage development new `` gentle '' obesity surgery .</detailed_description>
