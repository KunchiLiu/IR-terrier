	<brief_title>ESI With EUS Differentiate T3 T4 ESCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer ( EC ) one common malignant tumor world , China high incidence esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) .According TNM stag system Union International Cancer Control ( UICC ) ( 7th Edition , 2012 ) , EC invade esophageal adventitia T3 stage ; invades pleura , pericardium diaphragm T4a stage ; involve adjacent vital organ ( mainly thoracic aorta , aortic arch , trachea , tracheal bifurcation , spine ) T4b stage.It consider T3- T4a-stage tumor surgically resect , tumor T4b stage suitable surgical resection.Therefore , important physician patient know whether tumor metastasize adjacent organ consider resection . The preoperative stage unclear many case progressive disease involvement vital organ discover exploratory thoracotomy , resection may need terminate prematurely , lead unnecessary injuries.Therefore , accurate preoperative staging EC , especially late stage , important decide appropriate therapeutic option evaluation prognosis . The image method use preoperative stag EC include endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) . However , EUS poor accuracy advance ESCC , especially T3 T4 stage ESCC . Therefore , necessary improve preoperative accuracy EUS advance EC . Since extraesophageal space contains loose connective tissue saline permeate extraesophageal space separate esophagus adjacent organ ; furthermore , saline serf EUS contrast agent ( negative ) detect EUS.Therefore , envisage saline directly inject extraesophageal space , separation esophageal adventitia adjacent organ ( especially thoracic aorta , arcus aorta , tracheal bifurcation ) observe EUS . In recent experiment canine model , guide EUS , extraesophageal saline injection successfully conduct saline separate esophageal adventitia adjacent organ include thoracic aorta , arcus aorta , trachea bronchial bifurcation without complication .</detailed_description>
