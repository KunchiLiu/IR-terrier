	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The objective project ass whether dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would alleviate burden carbohydrate counting patient type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) without significant degradation post-meal glucose control . Our primary hypothesis meal-announcement strategy ( pre-meal CHO-independent bolus ) equivalent meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement strategy ( full CHO-matching bolus ) closed-loop regulation glucose level adult T1D . Our secondary hypothesis closed-loop strategy meal-announcement strategy ( pre-meal CHO-independent bolus ) meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement strategy ( full CHO-matching bolus ) well conventional pump treatment regulation glucose level adult T1D .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . Each patient admit three time clinical research facility . In meal-and-carbohydrate-announcement visit , patient eat 3 meal accompany match insulin bolus ( depend carbohydrate content meal ) glucose level subsequently regulate use dual-hormone closed-loop system . In meal-announcement visit , patient eat 3 meal inject partial insulin bolus ( depend carbohydrate content meal ) remain need insulin deliver base glucose sensor excursion part closed-loop operation . In control visit , patient use conventional pump therapy regulate glucose level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female ≥ 18 year old . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year . The subject insulin pump therapy least 3 month . Last ( less 3 month ) HbA1c ≤ 12 % . Clinically significant microvascular complication : nephropathy ( estimate glomerular filtration rate 40 ml/min ) , neuropathy ( especially diagnose gastroparesis ) severe proliferative retinopathy judge investigator . Recent ( &lt; 3 month ) acute macrovascular event e.g . acute coronary syndrome cardiac surgery . Ongoing pregnancy . Severe hypoglycemic episode within two week screen . Medication likely affect interpretation result well know impact gastric emptying : Motilium® , Prandase® , Victoza® , Byetta® Symlin® . Known suspect allergy trial product , meal content include nut , peanut , dairy product egg . Unusual nutritional habit ( e.g . vegetarian ) Other serious medical illness likely interfere study participation ability complete trial judgment investigator . Failure comply team 's recommendation ( e.g . willing eat snack , willing change pump parameter , etc ) . Unreliable carbohydrate count lack insulin carbohydrate ratio Problems venous access</criteria>
