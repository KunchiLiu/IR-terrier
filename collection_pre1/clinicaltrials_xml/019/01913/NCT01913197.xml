	<brief_summary>In standard prostate brachytherapy treatment , seed place throughout prostate treat entire gland . This do , past , impossible know cancer locate within prostate . Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) identify tumor ( ) high degree accuracy . This trial ass whether use MRI guide prostate brachytherapy result less chronic toxicity allow low dos deliver region prostate without tumor simultaneously allow high dos tumor . Subjects enrol study follow two year evaluate toxicity . In addition , two year undergo MRI biopsy ass cancer control rate treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate brachytherapy popular treatment clinically localized prostate cancer . In properly select patient , highly effective biochemical ( PSA ) disease free survival rate 85-95 % 5-10 year . However , technique currently limited inability localize cancer within prostate . The multifocal nature prostate cancer well establish . Because inability know within prostate cancer locate , radiation must deliver throughout gland . Although blind approach lead good result , clear region prostate surround tissue overexpose radiation others underexposed relative true need base tumor burden proximity tumor area . Multiple study show significant correlation MRI abnormalities radical prostatectomy specimens determine size location cancer focus . MRI image already begin incorporate diagnostic therapeutic procedure prostate cancer experimental basis investigator . The image fuse real time TRUS successfully perform targeted biopsy . In study , propose use MRI image pre-treatment plan process identify tumor within prostate prior brachytherapy use image direct dosimetry planning . The primary goal study decrease chronic toxicity assess Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0 decrease integral dose region prostate tumor . A secondary goal increase dose tumor ( ) demonstrate ability maintain urethral normal tissue dos . We also wish perform dosimetric comparison normal tissue tumor ( ) technique use compare would do patient receive traditional implant . Finally , propose perform prostate MRI follow biopsy evaluate persistent/recurrent disease 2 year treatment .</detailed_description>
