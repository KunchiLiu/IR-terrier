	<brief_summary>Soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) rare group malignant heterogenous tumor ( &gt; 50 histological subtypes , include liposarcoma , commonest subtype STS ) distinct genetic , pathological clinical profile , vary pattern tumor spread . The optimal cytotoxic treatment group patient remain uncertain . Single agent effective include doxorubicin ifosfamide , objective response rate progression-free survival time remain modest . There clearly need improve treatment option liposarcoma . Eribulin , antimicrotubule agent target protein tubulin cell , interfere cancer cell division growth , demonstrate activity STS . Therefore , reasonable explore whether anti-microtubule agent like cabazitaxel role STS . Cabazitaxel show relatively safe , effective tolerate . This drug approve FDA prostate cancer . The main objective trial determine whether cabazitaxel prolong infusional ifosfamide demonstrate sufficient antitumor activity liposarcoma .</brief_summary>
