	<brief_summary>Recently show clear reproducible Doppler signal record lung parenchyma mean pulse Doppler ultrasound system incorporate special signal processing package parametric Doppler , TPD , EchoSense Ltd. , Haifa , Israel ) . These lung Doppler signal ( LDS ) full synchrony cardiac cycle obtain lung , include area remote heart main pulmonary vessel . The LDS wave typically peak velocity 30 cm/s relatively high power , make possible detect despite aforementioned attenuation air lung . The LDS think represent radial wall movement small pulmonary blood vessel , cause pressure pulse wave cardiac origin propagate throughout lung vasculature . The LDS may contain information significant diagnostic physiological value regard pulmonary parenchyma vasculature , well cardio-vascular system general . Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) condition characterize reshape small pulmonary artery increase pulmonary vascular resistance , lead gradually right-sided cardiac failure . A trans-thoracic echocardiograph ( TTE ) test classically undertaken order screen pulmonary hypertension . However , systolic pulmonary artery pressure ( SPAP ) value thereby obtain often imprecise depend upon expertise individual carry test . Therefore , pulmonary arterial pressure cardiac output value ascertain right-sided cardiac catheterization , consider gold-standard , invasive . In pilot study adult PAH patient ( unpublished ) , lung Doppler signal show potential diagnose pulmonary hypertension two different way : First , measure degree attenuation LDS acute pressure rise chest cavity ( i.e . Valsalva maneuver ) . Second , detect difference LDS patient PAH control subject . One objectives present study evaluate lung Doppler signal pediatric patient various age group , without pulmonary vascular disease . The second objective study verify previous finding abnormal lung Doppler signal adult patient pulmonary hypertension .</brief_summary>
