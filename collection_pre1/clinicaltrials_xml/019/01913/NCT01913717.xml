	<brief_title>Short-term High Precision Radiotherapy Early Prostate Cancer With Concomitant Boost Dominant Lesion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 70 % men newly diagnose prostate cancer feature organ-confined disease . Conventional treatment option prostate-confined cancer include radical prostatectomy , external beam radiation therapy , brachytherapy active surveillance . All currently available treatment comparable toxicity risk high social economic impact , hence best treatment option define yet . In radiation oncology field gold standard prostate cancer management 7-8 week intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , deliver late generation accelerator provide modulate arc delivery ( eg . RapidArcâ„¢ , Varian ) newly develop machine Vero system ( BrainLab AG - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd ) . The present research project aim improve current treatment prostate confine tumor , evaluate best strategy deliver very-short hypofractionated radiotherapy scheme . In first part AIRC grant in-silica study perform 10 test prostate cancer patient , comparative competitive treatment plan state art treatment option prostate cancer : Vero system , RapidArc system , Cyberknife ( available European Institute Oncology IEO , Milan , Italy ) , protontherapy ( available Centre Adrotherapy , Pavia , Italy ) . This dosimetric comparison perform order define technique provide maximum target coverage minimum dose surround organ risk ( OARs ) use perform clinical trial follow within AIRC grant . After perform in-silica study , 65 newly diagnose prostate cancer patient 2011 National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) risk category range low intermediate undergoing hormonal treatment , consecutively enrol prospective phase II trial . The patient treat Division Radiation Oncology IEO , dose delivery system result fit in-silica study . Simultaneous Integrated Boost ( SIB ) technique apply deliver total dose 36.25 Gy 5 fraction ( 10 day ) whole prostate ( 7.25 Gy/fraction ) 37.5 Gy dominant intraprostatic lesion DIL ( 7.5 Gy/fraction ) , profit high sensibility prostate cancer high dose/fraction . Several strategy apply order reduce dose surround OARs . In order define localization DIL , multiparametic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pelvis perform ( spectroscopy , diffusion weight perfusion acquisition ) , fuse compute tomography ( CT ) scan . In-room image-guidance apply treatment section , order minimize uncertainty intra inter-fraction prostate localization . At end radiotherapy course , patient followed-up , order ass treatment safety effectiveness term early late toxicity , tumor control . A sample prostate tumor tissue biological study take microarray analysis . The expression specific marker radiosensitivity radioresistance investigate .</detailed_description>
