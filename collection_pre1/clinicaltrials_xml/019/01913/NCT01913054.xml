	<brief_summary>Gastroscopy , conventional examination gastrointestinal tract disease , play important role especially early diagnosis differential diagnosis esophageal gastric carcinoma . However , conventional gastroscopy associate several adverse effect ( include throat discomfort , breath-holding , nausea , vomit , laryngeal spasm increase heart rate ) due patient intolerant examination even refuse procedure due fear effect . Recently , painless gastroscopy apply increasingly widely outpatients meet increase need comfortable medical care . Painless gastroscopy commonly perform general anesthesia without establish artificial airway . This associate even higher anesthetic risk general anesthesia operating room due basic patient monitor life-supporting equipment , one anesthetist perform anesthesia , fatigue anesthesia , requirement high turnover rate , well limited understand patient 's condition . Therefore , availability sedative analgesic provide rapid onset , sufficient sedation analgesia , short recovery time less adverse effect premise perform painless gastroscopy . Currently , combine intravenous anesthesia fentanyl propofol , commonly use clinic , still associate long duration action , hypotension patient prolonged recovery . Etomidate increasingly utilized in-clinic diagnosis treatment procedure painless coloscopy early induced abortion due rapid onset , rapid metabolism minimal impact circulatory respiratory system . However , study combine intravenous anesthesia fentanyl etomidate painless gastroscopy previously report . The main purpose study explore efficacy safety combine intravenous anesthesia fentanyl etomidate painless gastroscopy compare combination fentanyl propofol middle age elderly patient , provide reliable evidence implementation promotion comfortable medical care .</brief_summary>
