	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate whether intake diet high content butyrate ( dairy fat ) affect blood FIAF concentration compare control diet . Further examine whether high intake inulin ( prebiotic ) increase proportion butyrate-producing bacteria gut thereby affect blood FIAF concentration . In addition , correlation FIAF blood concentration rest energy expenditure , blood lipid profile gut microbiota composition investigate . Furthermore , study investigate whether source FIAF determine . To end , adipose tissue biopsy analyze vitro experiment fecal water sample carry . The study crossover randomize control trial 3 arm . Each arm duration 3 week . 20 overweight/obese subject enrol study randomize order intervention . Before intervention period , blood sample collect participant rest metabolic rate measure . At end intervention period , participant collect feces 5 consecutive day . In addition , adipose tissue biopsy take intervention period .</brief_summary>
