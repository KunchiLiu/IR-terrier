	<brief_summary>Stimulants alleviate information processing task performance deficit Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . Long acting formulation amphetamine lisdexamphetamine dimesylate ( LDX ) especially valuable target school day improve classroom performance . Although stimulant widely use treatment ADHD , exact mechanism action effect task performance completely know . According State Regulation Deficit ( SRD ) model , child ADHD difficulty regulating level arousal/activation task response change demand environment . This lead problem downregulating overaroused state upregulating underaroused state . According view , stimulant exert therapeutic effect ( part ) optimise arousal/activation level - especially state underarousal/activation . Arousal/activation level also alter extrinsic factor event rate ( ER ) , e.g. , rate information present . Multiple study suggest fast slow event cause problem individual ADHD , relate overarousal underarousal state respectively . Putting intrinsic ( stimulant ) extrinsic ( ERs ) factor together lead prediction change rate information present task may alter efficacy stimulant affect optimal stimulant dose level . More specifically , one dose stimulant may optimal slow ER task ( increase arousal/activation level ) may less effective high ER task set arousal/activation level need lower increase . Adding stimulant already overactivated state may exacerbate associate problem . The implication different dose stimulant need different environmental condition optimal performance . For example , child ADHD might require different dosage classroom set optimize performance . In addition , neuropsychological basis performance deficit improvement ER stimulant also unclear . According SRD model , underlie mechanism specific problem motor activation/preparation effort regulation . Event-related potential ( ERP ) , pupil size measurement cardiac measure enable u see objectively motor activation/preparation effort affect ER simulants . In study investigator aim test prediction SRD model identify neurobiological basis stimulant action .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Primary purpose : pathophysiology basic science The aim study enlarge knowledge mechanism action long acting formulation amphetamine neurobiological basis stimulant action . Furthermore , study aim test prediction State Regulation Deficit Model ( SRD ) effect stimulant medication presentation rate stimulus task performance child ADHD . The basic hypothesis performance child ADHD effect stimulant medication depend task demand presentation rate stimulus . - Enrollment : number Subjects : 25 child ADHD ( Anticipated ) - Study Phase : phase III - Study Design : This study comprise 5 phase . The expected total duration study trial 10 week subject . - Phase 1 : screening ( week 1 ) At begin study extensive screening procedure undertake . At screen visit , physician psychologist ascertain inclusion exclusion criterion use several instrument ( questionnaire , parent interview , intelligence test ) . Furthermore , physician ass cardiac risk take family history cardiac disease physical examination . Also length , weight blood pressure child monitor . - Phase 2 : titration ( week 2 - 5 ) If screen indicate child eligible parent would like start medication treatment child , participate 4-week open-label titration LDX . The aim stepwise titration procedure determine child 's clinically effective dose . LDX start dose 30mg/day adjust 70 mg/day necessary . During titration phase parent ask fill daily diary . Before medication trial end week medication trial , investigator measure symptom change evaluate potential side effect LDX . These assessment include monitor ADHD symptom physical examination potential drug side effect . Furthermore , physician monitor weight , length , blood pressure heart rate visit . - Phase 3 : maintenance LDX ( week 6 - 7 ) If child benefit take LDX , he/she maintain his/her therapeutic dose approximately two week . - Phase 4 : DBPC trial ( week 8 - 9 ) - Intervention model , group assignment : single group , cross-over design - Number arm ( number intervention group ) : 2 arm , within-subject design ( 2 treatment condition subject : active medication vs. placebo ) - Masking : double-blind ( subject , parent investigator blind treatment condition ) - Allocation : randomize - Study end point classification : NA The investigator plan use randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover ( DBPC ) design . Children test twice ( administration optimal dose LDX placebo ) computer-based behavioral paradigm measure efficient arousal modification response change environmental setting . The investigator use Go/No-Go task 4 different ERs ( 1 sec , 2secs , 4secs , 8secs ) . If child see upright triangle ( Go stimulus ) respond ; child see invert triangle ( No-Go stimulus ) must withhold respond . Parents , child experimenter blind treatment condition . For blind purpose blindfold child take IMP placebo ( e.g . LDX placebo capsule completely identical ; however , difference barely noticeable one blindfold ) . The order treatment condition ( LDX vs. placebo ) randomly assign counterbalance across child . Between treatment condition interval approximately 1 week . During interval LDX intake continue . Before test session washout period least 48 hour ; LDX placebo give morning test . Each test session take place time day ; preferably afternoon minimalize possible time day effect approximately 3-4 hour child take LDX placebo . While child perform computer task , psychophysiological index effort motor activation/preparation record : event-related potential ( ERP ) ( use EEG ) , heart rate ( use EEG ) pupil size ( use eye track ) . Phase 5 : follow-up visit ( week 10 ) At end DBPC trial , drug stop child evaluate approximately 1 week washout period safety assessment . During visit possible alternative treatment ADHD also discuss .</detailed_description>
