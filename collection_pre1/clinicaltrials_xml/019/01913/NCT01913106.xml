	<brief_title>HSV-tk + Valacyclovir Therapy Combination With Brachytherapy Recurrent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This investigational new drug application describes propose phase I/II study design assess safety efficacy AdV-tk gene therapy combination standard brachytherapy patient locally recurrent prostate cancer fail radiation primary treatment without minimal metastasis . These patient standard treatment demonstrate high degree efficacy eradicate tumor reasonable degree safety . Thus , potential risk associate use gene therapy group would appear reasonable . This application use replication defective adenovirus vector ( ADV/RSV-tk ) deliver HSV-tk gene biologic vector gene therapy . Direct introduction therapeutic gene malignant cell vivo may provide effective treatment solid tumor prostate cancer . The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase ( HSV-tk ) gene code enzyme phosphorylates nucleoside analog ganciclovir ( GCV ) intermediate incorporate newly synthesize DNA terminate replication , lead cell death . Since normal mammalian cell possess enzyme , cytotoxicity depend successful introduction expression HSV-tk gene , phosphorylation ganciclovir synthesis DNA . Non-dividing cell may express HSV-tk phosphorylate ganciclovir harm since synthesize DNA . This approach especially suitable treatment tumor rapidly divide tumor cell adjacent tissue make largely non-proliferating cell . Using human animal model prostate cancer demonstrate adenovirus-mediated transfer HSV-tk gene result sensitivity ganciclovir vitro growth suppression mouse prostate cancer vivo .</detailed_description>
