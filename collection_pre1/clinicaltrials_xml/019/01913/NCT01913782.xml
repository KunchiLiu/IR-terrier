	<brief_title>The Impact Epidural Steroid Analgesia Functional MRI Patients With LBP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain , ancient enemy human kind , one mystical phenomenon within body . For century , people search magic wand solve issue reach heaven destination . However , like original sin commit Adam Eve , shadow pain always surround even rebel body spirit . Even , pain trap soul body acute stage induce noxious stimulation also change mind body whenever chronic period start even stimulation disappears . Chronic pain far become one great health issue modern people . Chronic pain affect million people treatment option quite limited effective everyone [ 1 ] . On way , people develop chronic pain , especially painful stimulation , remain investigated . Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) prevalent form chronic pain , common reason disability working-age population [ 2 ] . CLBP also report associated many abnormal brain anatomy function include reduction cortical gray matter bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , thalamus , brain stem , primary somatosensory cortex , posterior parietal cortex . [ 3-5 ] There already many study demonstrate abnormal cortical function people CLBP [ 6-10 ] . Meanwhile , DLPFC also report influence many pain process include pain modulation [ 11-13 ] , placebo analgesia [ 14 , 15 ] , pain control [ 16 , 17 ] pain catastrophizing [ 18 ] . And recent report show effective treatment chronic back pain patient reverse abnormal DLPFC function [ 19 ] . Meanwhile , epidural steroid injection perform clinical routinely manage low back pain patient . Patients refuse indication surgery little response rehabilitation may consider management . There good evidence short- long-term relief chronic pain secondary disc herniation local anesthetic steroid [ 20 , 21 ] . However , impact treatment functionalMRI ( fMRI ) never investigate . The investigator research try solve issue . Patients first visit pain clinic low back pain root sign include study . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Patients disc herniation radiculitis 18 year age . 2 . Patients history chronic function-limiting low back pain low extremity pain least one month ' duration . 3 . Patients competent understand study provide write informed consent participate outcome measurement . Exclusion Criteria : Patients previous lumbar surgery metal instrument . Initial MRI show spinal stenosis without disc herniation . Patients unstable opioid use , uncontrolled psychiatric disorder , uncontrolled acute medical illness , condition could interfere interpretation outcome assessment , pregnant lactate woman allergy local anesthetic steroid . Patients unable perform MRI fMRI also exclude . Pre-enrollment evaluation include demographic data , medical surgical history coexist disease , lumbar spine X-ray also perform . After physical neurological examination , pain questionnaire apply initial pain evaluation include pain intensity character physical activity emotion influence form pain . Patients perform first MRI/fMRI study ( MRI inform consent , appendix B ) lumbar spine brain condition . Anyone n't show spine problem exclude epidural steroid injection . After patient ' MRI/fMRI evaluation , caudal epidural steroid injection ( Regiment : 0.2 % lidocaine plus kenacort 40 mg 20 ml , ) perform pain therapy room ( Epidural inform consent , appendix C ) . Caudal epidural block perform 2-3 time 2 week interval reach optimal analgesia . The pain condition follow every month pain questionnaire 3 month . The secondary MRI/fMRI perform 3 month later first caudal epidural steroid injection . MRI scan acquire 3T scanner NCKU . The special technician help u patient MRI scan set MRI parameter . Dr. Sun qualify radiologist help data analysis MRI performance . The investigator also follow method describe [ 19 ] : An anatomical scan acquire begin session last 5 min . The following parameter use : echo time ( TE ) 3 m , repetition time ( TR ) 2.3 , flip angle 9。 , resolution 1*1*1 mm . During functional scan ~5 min , subject perform Multi-Source Interference Task previous report [ 22 , 23 ] . The task stimulus present screen subject ' view lie MRI scanner , subject respond three-button response box . The task three level difficulty , motor control task , easy level difficult level . The task enhance brain network pain persistent [ 23 ] . The parameter functional scan follow : echo-planar imaging , TE 3 m , TR 2.26s , flip angle 90。 , 128 frame , 64*64 matrix , 38 slice whole-brain coverage , resolution 4*4*4 mm . Images acquire axial plane , plus 30。 anterior commissure-posterior commissure line avoid eye . The fMRI data analysis help university team . Total patient number calculate basis significant pain relief set 33 patient follow statistic parameter : α : 0.05 ( type I error probability ) , power 0.8 ( probability correctly reject null hypothesis ) , δ:0.5 ( difference population mean ) , σ:1 ( standard deviation difference ) . 20 % noncompliance rate add total 40 patient include study . According previous report , 20 low back patient ( oral pain control drug plus rehab refuse epidural steroid injection ) need include twice MRI survey . [ 19 ] Statistical analysis include chi-square , Fisher exact test , test pair test . The chi-square use test difference proportion . Fisher exact test whatever expect value le 5 ; pair test use compare pre-and post-treatment result . For comparison mean group , test do . All data present mean ± SEM , P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant case . This study provide good relationship pain fMRI image brain local lumbar spine management . And investigator also want perform first data show local lumbar analgesia impact brain image change .</detailed_description>
