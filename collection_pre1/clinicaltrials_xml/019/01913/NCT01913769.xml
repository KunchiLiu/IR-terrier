	<brief_summary>Background : Chemoradiation important treatment strategy locally advance inoperable unresectable disease . Radiation dose independent predictor pathological response . In addition , chemotherapy impact aspect outcome . Improvements local treatment delivery need facilitate dose escalation minimize toxicity . There sequential improvement tumor localization , radiation planning delivery year . Helical tomotherapy nowadays provide precise data radiotherapy ( RT ) dose deliver thoracic malignancy , allow great spar heart dos associate increased complication . However , heart disease show wide spectrum pathology , multiple risk factor relate . The damage myocytes may lead myocardial perfusion defect , also functional deterioration , even biomarkers . Since impact radiation-induced heart injury patient thoracic malignancy ( include esophageal cancer , lung cancer , et al ) poorly document , try delineate RT-related cardiac effect clinical impact . Objective : This study aim investigate correlation post-tomotherapy cardiovascular effect myocardial perfusion cardiac functional study . Methods : The study plan enroll thoracic cancer patient undergo local RT complete staging . Patients receive global risk score assessment ( Framingham Risk Score , FRS ) , blood sample basic biochemistry , inflammatory biomarker , myocardial perfusion image ( MPI ) time point RT . The result MPI analyze qualitative visual interpretation perfusion pattern , functional quantitative data cardiac functional parameter well . The patient regular followed-up CV OPD , follow clinical judgement guideline . The association baseline follow-up MPI , biomarker clinical presentation investigate . Expected result : We obtain myocardial perfusion visual qualitative data patient receive locoregional RT , respectively . These result help understanding pathophysiology , clinical management follow-up suspect RT-related heart disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The risk RT-related heart disease well recognize underlying mechanism initiation progression , roles play microvascular damage , fibrosis atherosclerosis remain unclear . Studying RT-related heart disease demonstrate irradiation affect cardiac structure microvascular function dose time-dependent manner , substantial damage intermediate high dose irradiation , minor alteration low dos . Not structural change also functional deterioration note . Studies disclose incidence post 3D-RT perfusion defect approximately 40 % , patient volume-dependent perfusion defect within 2 year RT . To good evaluation RT-related heart disease , plan initiate prospective study trail take advantage recent technical advance tomotherapy , new Cadimium-Zinc-Telluride ( CZT ) cardiac camera . - Estimated Case Number : 100 patient enrol study . 1 . Patients thoracic cancer transfer CV OPD initial cardiovascular risk factor assessment , start radiation therapy . 2 . Past history , family history , basic lab data Framingham cardiovascular risk assessment apply . After approach risk stratification , patient classify intermediated high risk need work-up . Who need undergo myocardial perfusion study enrol study RT course . 3 . All enrolled subject provide basic demographic data sign inform consent . 4 . Myocardial perfusion image Tl-201 CZT camera perform nuclear medicine department FEMH , complete baseline evaluation RT . 5 . The patient receive schedule treatment plan , include RT . 6 . Follow-up CV OPD base clinical decision guideline : blood biochemistry inflammation marker , CV risk score . Further work-up would indicate functional status deterioration aggravate symptom . 7 . Post-therapeutic myocardial perfusion study 12 month first CV OPD visit . 8 . Comparing clinical follow-up data group , include global functional assessment , blood sample data , myocardial perfusion scan , quantitative cardiac functional parameter . Blood sample Peripheral blood drawn measurement blood glucose , lipid profile , circulate biomarker CRP . The genomic test involve study . Myocardial perfusion study-for quantitative functional parameter , qualitative quantitative myocardial perfusion scan . Patients refer SPECT MPI evaluation CAD underwent 1-day Tl-201 stress/rest MPI protocol , daily practice FEMH . Pharmacological stress induce standard dipyridomale infusion . Tl-201 2 mCi inject 7 min induce stress . The software package Myovation Alcyone ( GE Healthcare ) , QGS QPS use quantitative analysis MPI polar map use 17-segment model leave ventricle . Automated analysis gate acquisition high-dose ( rest ) scan performed determine leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) . Integrated clinical information , follow-up nuclear medicine cardiac scan perform time point &amp; RT collect analyze .</detailed_description>
