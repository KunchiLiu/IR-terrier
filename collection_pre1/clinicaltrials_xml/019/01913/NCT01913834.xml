	<detailed_description>This study aim look teriparatide spread nose blood stream give liquid nasal delivery system call CriticalSorbâ„¢ . CriticalSorb develop Critical Pharmaceuticals improve absorption drug nose blood stream hope replace injection . For part study radioactive compound ( routinely use nuclear medicine clinic diagnosis ) add formulation order investigate formulation spread nose spray . The study carry postmenopausal female age great 55 year age osteoporosis commonly affect woman . The study involve 8 visit . The first visit ass eligibility . On visit 2 participant receive injection teriparatide . On visit 2-6 participant receive nasal dose teriparatide via nasal device different dose level , blood sample take measure drug level follow dosing . For visit 5 6 nasal dose radioactive marker add gamma camera imaging also carry . These visit also compare two different nasal device . Visit 7 follow visit .
