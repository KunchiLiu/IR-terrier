	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia associate reduction quality life , functional status , cardiac performance , overall survival.1 Catheter ablation , center electrical isolation trigger focus within pulmonary vein ( PVI ) circumferential lesion around PV ostia , show result sustain improvement quality life , decreased hospitalization , potentially , improve survival.2-4 PVI accomplish percutaneous catheter-based thermo-coagulation ( burn ) radiofrequency ( RF ) energy delivery alternatively thermo-cooling ( freeze ) cryoballoon catheter.5 Cryothermal ablation cryoballoon catheter offer efficacious mean achieve PVI safer establish technique . Although cryoballoon ablation use clinical practice sometime , optimal duration cryoballoon ablation determine . Moreover , biophysics cryo-lesion formation suggest repeat short freeze ( `` freeze-thaw-freeze '' cycle ) may efficacious achieve deep homogenous lesion compare prolong freezing duration . This grant proposal verify repeat short freezing cycle efficacious ( i.e. , few recurrence AF ) , safe , establish standard long , single freeze cycle .</brief_summary>
