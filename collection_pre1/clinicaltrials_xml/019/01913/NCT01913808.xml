	<detailed_description>Both pre- postoperative anaemia common patient undergoing major orthopaedic surgery . The main consequence perioperative anaemia increase risk red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . Allogeneic RBC transfusion anaemia associate higher postoperative mortality morbidity . Since blood transfusion increase Hb level transiently come price higher mortality morbidity ( e.g . postoperative infection ) , three-pillar concept patient blood management ( PBM ) develop reduce risk blood transfusion improve patient outcome . Among three pillar , treatment prevention preoperative anaemia mainstay PBM . Also second pillar , minimisation intraoperative blood loss,15 target least indirectly patient 's haemoglobin ( Hb ) level . The third PBM pillar , use low Hb cut-off level trigger transfusion , mean certain degree postoperative anaemia take account . However , remain unclear whether lowered transfusion threshold allow optimal functional recovery quality life . Since patient undergo total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) often elderly several comorbidities , prolong exposure low Hb level good option population . Furthermore , TKA patient mobilise soon possible surgery increase metabolic demand . Although , depend timescale surgery , oral iron suggest preoperatively anaemic patient absolute iron deficiency , oral iron show benefit placebo anaemic patient low limb arthroplasty . In patient risk functional iron deficiency due chronic inflammation different aetiology , intravenous ( i.v . ) iron administration proven superiority oral iron . Even iron-deficient patient without establish anaemia , i.v . iron improve physical performance cardiac functional class . Thus , postoperative anaemia treatment i.v . iron might reduce RBC requirement also improve performance , rehabilitation outcome . The aim study compare efficacy postoperative i.v . ferric carboxymaltose ( FCM ) oral ferrous glycine sulphate ( FS ) early improvement postoperative anaemia total knee arthroplasty whether iron treatment could facilitate recovery surgery .</detailed_description>
