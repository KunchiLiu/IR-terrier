	<brief_summary>Background The use antimicrobial recognise main selective pressure drive emergence spread antimicrobial resistance human bacterial pathogen . Urinary Tract Infections ( UTIs ) one common infection present primary care empirical antimicrobial treatment currently recommend . Previous research identify substantial proportion Irish GPs prescribe antimicrobial UTI accordance Guidelines Antimicrobial Prescribing Primary Care Ireland . Aim To design , implement evaluate effectiveness complex intervention GP antimicrobial prescribing adult ( 18 year age ) patient ' antimicrobial consumption present suspect UTI . Methods The SIMPLE study randomise three arm intervention practice level randomisation . Adult patient present suspected UTI primary care include study . The intervention integrate component GPs patient . For GPs intervention include interactive workshop , audit feedback report automate electronic prompt summarise recommend first line antimicrobial treatment , one intervention arm , recommendation consider delay antimicrobial prescribing . For patient multimedia application information leaflet include . A minimum 920 patient recruit 30 practice . The primary outcome change prescribe first line antimicrobial accordance Guidelines Antimicrobial Prescribing Primary Care Ireland . The intervention take place 15 month . Data collect remote electronic anonymised data extraction system ( iPCRN ) , text messaging system GP patient interview survey . The intervention strengthen implementation social marketing framework economic evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supporting Improvement Management Prescribing Urinary Tract Infections ( SIMPle )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , 80 % antimicrobial prescribing take place community general practitioner ( GPs ) . Ireland one three country Europe level outpatient antimicrobial prescribing increase . Within context , inappropriate overprescription antimicrobial GPs recognize factor contribute spread AMR . The Guidelines Antimicrobial Prescribing Primary Care Ireland provide advice selection antimicrobial drug common infection recommend use specific antimicrobial , reserve drug serious infection . However , despite widespread availability guideline , recent research identify less 40 % outpatient prescription urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) make accord first-line recommendation . Urinary tract infection predominantly cause bacteria ; Escherichia coli , generally treat empirically , prior result antimicrobial susceptibility test . Antimicrobial resistance critical factor treatment UTIs , second common bacterial infection primary care . Social market conceptual framework guide development intervention . Formative ( qualitative ) research explored culture antimicrobial prescribing GP 's patient 's perspective . Through series interview GPs ( n = 15 ) focus group patient ( n = 35 ) , predictor GP 's decision prescribe antimicrobial patient 's expectation receive antimicrobial explore . The aim SIMPle design , implement evaluate effectiveness complex intervention GP antimicrobial prescribing adult ( 18 year age ) patient ' antimicrobial consumption present suspect UTI . The primary outcome increase number first-line antimicrobial prescription , recommend Guidelines Antimicrobial Prescribing Primary Care Ireland ( 2011 ) , suspect UTIs primary care 10 % adult patient . Methods The cluster intervention practice , GPs within practice invite participate . The baseline population recruitment patient form practice West Ireland submit urine sample Galway University Hospitals ( GUH ) laboratory . The popular patient management software system choose , SIMPle study build remote data extraction , provision audit feedback report computer prompt integrate within GP 's patient management software system . This study undertake four phase : Phase 1 , baseline data collection ; Phase 2 , GP intervention ; Phase 3 , patient intervention Phase 4 , endpoint data collection . Computerized remote data extraction facilitate Irish Primary Care Research Network ( iPCRN ) patient data identify appropriate coding suspect UTI consultation patient management software system . To promote encourage consultation coding , currently routine practice , intervention precede cod workshop begin Phase 1 . All practice require register iPCRN cod workshop . Practices monitor two month delivery workshop establish uptake coding , whilst also facilitate baseline data collection period ( Phase 1 ) . Phase 2 begin interactive workshop ( intervention arm A B ) , introduce intervention component specific arm . Phase 3 see roll-out patient education practice . The antimicrobial prescribing within practice monitor six month Phases 2 3 audit feedback report . Evaluation impact intervention carry Phase 4 . All patient eligible age 18 year present symptom UTI , determine GP consultation cod . Previous research establish 56 % UTI patient receive antimicrobial , 38 % prescription make recommended first-line treatment . Sample size calculation base absolute 10 % increase first-line prescription accord guideline ( primary outcome ) . Additional assumption sample size calculation include power 80 % Î± 5 % , Practice attrition dependent completeness consultation coding , monitor correct Phase 1 .</detailed_description>
