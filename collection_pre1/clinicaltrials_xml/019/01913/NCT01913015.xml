	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot phase I trial study side effect dietary fat level abiraterone acetate uptake patient metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer . Abiraterone acetate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Eating low high fat diet may increase uptake abiraterone acetate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dietary Fat Levels Abiraterone Acetate Uptake Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess dietary effect low fat high fat diet low abiraterone acetate dose ( 250 mg ) drug level compare standard dose administer fasting condition . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To potentially guide decision future use low dose abiraterone feed state decrease overall cost . II . To evaluate potential relationship esterase activity abiraterone metabolism exploratory analysis . III . To determine feasibility use patient-collected dried blood spot ( DBS ) sample pharmacokinetic monitoring . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive standard dose abiraterone acetate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) ( hold day 2 , 3 , 9 , 10 ) , low-dose abiraterone acetate PO QD day 3 10 . Patients eat low fat breakfast day 3 high fat breakfast day 10 . ARM II : Patients receive abiraterone acetate Arm I . Patients eat high fat breakfast day 3 , low fat breakfast day 10 .</detailed_description>
