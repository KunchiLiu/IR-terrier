	<brief_summary>Previous study show obese individual exhibit great reward-related brain activity response food cue lean individual group show successful weight loss maintainer previously obese maintain healthy weight increase control-related activity view food cue . These finding suggest key role reward-related brain area inhibitory control region eat behavior . However , study date examine ( ) whether response food cue ( i.e. , cue-reactivity ) change obese individual , ( b ) strategy effective alter brain response food cue , ( c ) neural mechanisms support change . Given omnipresent environmental cue eat association heighten reward-responsivity obesity , critical investigate way potentially alter food cue-reactivity obese . The widely employ approach behavioral weight loss treatment Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) , incorporate strategy control change cognition ( e.g. , avoid desire eat tempt food focus something else ) . This approach sometimes describe `` change- focused '' modify negative thought assume thereby change associate maladaptive emotion behavior . Alternatively , emerge evidence suggest Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) , teach participant recognize accept craving feeling need act upon , may also effective treat obesity . A third strategy often employ smoke cessation substance abuse treatment focus long-term consequence behavior , however form treatment typically use behavioral weight loss therapy . Thus although approach potentially effective , treatment approach differ greatly cognitive strategy employ . The primary aim propose research compare cognitive strategy use CBT ( ʻCHANGEʼ ) , cognitive strategy emphasize ACT ( ʻACCEPTʼ ) , cognitive strategy use smoking cessation ( ʻLATERʼ ) relative control condition ( ʻNOWʼ ) , effectiveness alter reward inhibitory control responses food cue among obese individual .</brief_summary>
