	<brief_summary>Among patient undergo heart surgery , measurable degree heart muscle tissue injury expect . The level injury show measure blood level specific molecule call cardiac biomarkers . Those cardiac biomarkers often use acute cardiac care diagnose myocardial infarction . Postoperative heart infarction remain frequent important complication heart surgery.Therefore important recognize cardiac event patient underwent heart surgery . Although different diagnostic tool use recognize event , know value cardiac biomarkers diagnose myocardial infarction heart surgery . In study investigator describe concentration change cardiac biomarkers time patient undergoing heart surgery , investigator try establish upper level value could indicate heart infarction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-sensitivity Troponin Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective interventional mono centre study . High-sensitivity troponin CK-MB measure different point time adult patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Experiments conduct O.L.V . Hospital , Aalst , Belgium , fully equip operating room intensive care facility presence board-certified anesthesiologist safety reason . After approval institutional ethic committee write informed consent , adult patient schedule different type cardiac surgery June 2013 June 2014 enrol . Collected data include demographic information , presence co-morbid condition basic preoperative laboratory testing ( include Hs-cTn CK-MB ) ( Table 1 ) well per- postoperative factor ( Table 2 ) . Four different surgeon perform surgery . The revascularization strategy work method choose accord surgeon 's preference good clinical practice . Standard monitoring use patient . Anaesthesia management discretion attend anaesthesiologist accord good clinical practice . Serum level CK-MB Hs-cTn measure induction anaesthesia ( placement arterial line ) , upon arrival intensive care unit ( ICU ) , well every 3 hour 12 hour , every 6 hour follow 12 hour last sample take 48 hour surgery . Samples analyse department Clinical Biochemistry institution Elecsys Troponin T hs immuno-assay . Lower limit quantification 0,14 Nano gram/L ( company data ) . Twelve-lead ECGs obtain routinely day prior surgery , immediately upon arrival ICU , 24 48 hour post-surgery retrospectively review cardiologist blind data evidence new postoperative MI . All cardiac event , describe Third Global MI Task Force definition MI , note . Additional ECG transesophageal echocardiography do discretion attend ICU physician , accord ICU protocol good clinical practice . Approved automate record keep system ( MetaVision Suite , iMDSoft , Netherlands ) use ICU . The principal investigator and/or co-investigators supervise data handling .</detailed_description>
