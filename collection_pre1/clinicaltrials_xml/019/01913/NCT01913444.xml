	<brief_summary>Maintenance adequate anticoagulation blood thin critical importance patient place extracorporeal life support , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . During ECMO , patient 's entire blood volume constantly expose artificial surface ECMO circuit . This exposure activate clot cascade , circuit risk clot formation , patient also risk clot within body . Hence anticoagulation vital allow ECMO circuit support patient extend period time . Anticoagulation ECMO achieve primarily use blood thinning agent call heparin . Heparin 's main mechanism action activate enzyme call antithrombin III ( AT III ) . AT III deficiency show common find pediatric patient require ECMO . This deficiency may result ineffective blood thin heparin . The purpose study determine neonate ECMO , process eliminates medication call ATryn® body . ATryn® form ATIII make goat 's milk . This ultimately aid establish standardized dosing use ATryn® patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Maintenance adequate anticoagulation critical importance patient place extracorporeal life support , ECMO . During ECMO , patient 's entire blood volume constantly expose artificial surface ECMO circuit . This exposure activate clot cascade , circuit risk clot formation , patient also risk thromboembolic event . Hence anticoagulation vital allow ECMO circuit support patient 's entire cardiopulmonary system extend period time . Anticoagulation ECMO achieve primarily use heparin continuous infusion . Heparin 's main mechanism action bind activate enzyme call antithrombin III ( AT III ) . AT III principal inhibitor blood coagulation serine proteases - Thrombin Factor Xa . In presence , bound heparin , inhibitory activity AT III greatly enhance . AT III deficiency show common find pediatric patient require ECMO . Our center report neonatal patient require ECMO also significant degree ATIII deficiency prior , ECMO bypass . This deficiency may lead challenge achieve adequate anticoagulation ECMO . For reason , institution already supplement antithrombin pre-ECMO circuit prim maintain AT III level 70 % entire length ECMO support . Optimizing AT III level may improve anticoagulation ECMO . This study aim determine pharmacokinetics recombinant antithrombin ( ATryn® ) supplementation . To date , use ATryn® primarily study adult . There publish data date , current study pharmacokinetics antithrombin III neonate , hence publish data pharmacokinetics antithrombin III neonatal ECMO population . Since use antithrombin III neonatal ECMO patient population thoroughly study , use antithrombin III supplementation varies greatly among different neonatal intensive care unit . Therefore , study aim determine pharmacokinetics antithrombin III , particularly ECMO patient , important lack data publish study patient population . By determine pharmacokinetics ATryn® neonatal ECMO patient population , aid establish standardized dose administration protocol supplementation antithrombin specific patient population . Summary Risks Benefits : ATryn® FDA approve use prevention peri-operative peri-partum thromboembolic event hereditary antithrombin III deficient patient . ATryn® transgenically produce recombinant antithrombin concentrate goat milk preservative free . It identical amino acid structure minor glycosylation difference endogenous human AT IIII . When assayed presence excess heparin , potency efficacy ATryn® different plasma-derived AT III concentrates.5 ATryn® administer continuous intravenous infusion , weight-adjusted loading maintenance dose regimen recommend medication 's package insert . As dose specific patient 's weight , theoretically minimize risk overdose . In addition , dose administer continuous infusion titrate maintain stable AT III level , additional potential less fluctuation patient 's AT III level . Not anticoagulation optimize throughout duration ECMO support , theoretically may decrease need , less fluctuation patient 's heparin requirement . This may furthermore minimize risk thromboembolic event within ECMO circuit patient . Additionally , ATryn® preservative free recombinant product , free risk viral infection prion transmission .</detailed_description>
