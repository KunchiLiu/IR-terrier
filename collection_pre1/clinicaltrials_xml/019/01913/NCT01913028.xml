	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Immunogenicity MEDI9929 After Single Administration Healthy Male Japanese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , single centre , randomise , single-blind , placebo-controlled , single ascend dose parallel study healthy male Japanese subject . Up 3 dose level MEDI9929 investigate . Primary object ass safety tolerability single ascend subcutaneous ( SC ) dose MEDI9929 healthy male Japanese subject . Secondary objective characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) MEDI9929 healthy male Japanese subject evaluate immunogenicity ( IM ) MEDI9929 healthy male Japanese subject . Up 24 healthy subject age 20 45 year participate maximum 3 cohort . Eight subject participate cohort . Subjects randomize 3:1 ratio ( active : placebo ) receive single dose either MEDI9929 placebo . Each subject participate one cohort . The first cohort receive Dose 1 MEDI9929 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) , second cohort receive Dose 2 MEDI9929 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) , third cohort receive Dose 3 MEDI9929 ( n=6 ) placebo ( n=2 ) . Following screening period maximum 28 day , subject stay study facility eight night start day dose ( Day -1 ) Day 8 . The follow period dose 84 day ( 112 day cohort 3 ) . Subjects receive single dose MEDI9929 placebo subcutaneously Day 1 safety monitoring serial collection blood sample PK evaluation follow throughout study period .</detailed_description>
