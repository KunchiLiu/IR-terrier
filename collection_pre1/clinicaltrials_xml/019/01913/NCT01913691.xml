	<brief_summary>Background : - Ipilimumab drug use treat melanoma treat surgically . It target molecule find T-cells human immune system . Blocking molecule T-cells might allow cell help destroy melanoma cell effectively . This drug also study cancer prostate cancer lung cancer , yet Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) . Researchers think therapy like ipilimumab enhances immune system may effective MCC . They want study safe drug effect immune system tumor . Objectives : - To determine number subject MCC take study drug remain alive 12 month later . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year older metastatic MCC . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants receive study drug 4 time , one dose every 21 day . After 4 visit , participant receive maintenance dose drug every 12 week drug longer beneficial . - They receive drug plastic tube usually insert vein arm . - It take 90 minute give dose . - At visit , participant screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Any tumor skin measure photographed . - Every 12 week study maintenance period , participant CT scan . Throughout study maintenance period , blood skin test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Drug Ipilimumab Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) rare , aggressive neuroendocrine cancer skin mortality approximately 33 % . Approximately one-third patient present metastatic disease , effective treatment . Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) , DNA virus express T antigen oncoproteins , find clonally integrated genome majority MCC tumor . MCC tumor progression believe associate development immune evasion , multiple line evidence ( high incidence immunocompromised population , report spontaneous regression , responses immune modulators , improve prognosis associate CD8+ intratumoral lymphocyte ) suggest immunotherapy may improve outcome patient advance MCC . Ipilimumab recombinant , human monoclonal antibody bind cytotoxic Tlymphocyte- associate antigen 4 show efficacy metastatic melanoma . Objectives : Primary : -Determine overall survival 12 month . Secondary : - Determine best overall response rate , assess modify RECIST immunerelated response criterion , week 12 . - Determine median survival . - Determine disease-specific survival ( DSS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) . - Evaluate safety tolerability ipilimumab patient metastatic MCC . - Assess biomarkers immune activation MCV-specific immune response . Eligibility : - Patients ( age great equal 18 year ) metastatic MCC ( AJCC stage 3b 4 ) . - Immunocompromised individual patient autoimmune disease exclude . Design : - Patients enroll NIH Clinical Center , Bethesda , MD ( primary site ) study sub-sites Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY ; University Michigan , Ann Arbor , MI ; University Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA. - Ipilimumab give dose 10 mg/kg 90-minute intravenous infusion day 1 21-day cycle 4 cycle . After 4 dos , patient may receive maintenance dose every 12 week disease progression unacceptable toxicity , additional 4 dos . - Imaging scan do week 12 , every 12 week study start week 21 . - Patients remain on-study follow-up 96 week last initial 4 dos . - Response progression evaluate use modified RECIST immune-related response criterion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis Merkel cell carcinoma confirm Laboratory Pathology , NCI , participate institute Department Pathology . Unresectable metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma Measurable disease define lesion measure least one dimension &gt; 20mm CXR , &gt; 10mm CT scan , &gt; 10mm caliber clinical exam . Life expectancy great equal 6 month . ECOG performance status 02 Willing travel NIH study subsites ( MSKCC , UMich , Penn ) followup visit . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy surgery . Patients must receive least one line chemotherapy achieve partial response ( 30 % reduction tumor burden ) good prior enrollment . EXCEPTION : Patients asymptomatic tumor show minimal progression ( &lt; 20 % tumor burden ) within last 2 month enrol without prior chemotherapy . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use ipilimumab patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , may eligible future pediatric trial . Patients must adequate hematological , hepatic , renal laboratory value , define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ( except subject Gilbert Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 2.0 time institutional upper limit normal . The effect ipilimumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason ipilimumab find teratogenic abortifacient effect animal study , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 4 month last injection ipilimumab . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Prior treatment ipilimumab . Patients immunocompromised list : Human immunodeficiency virus infection , Hepatitis B C infection , due unknown effect ipilimumab viral replication immune function potential severe side effect . Chronic administration ( defined daily every day continue use &gt; 14 day ) systemic corticosteroid ( include steroid eye drop ) immune suppressive drug , within 14 day first plan dose ipilimumab . Nasal , inhale steroid , topical steroid cream small body area exclude . Patients undergone allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation , solid organ transplantation require immunosuppression Prior Splenectomy Patients history , active autoimmune disease require treatment , Addison 's disease , autoimmune thyroiditis , Grave disease , systemic lupus erythematous , rheumatoid arthritis , autoimmune hepatitis , systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma variant ) , autoimmune vasculitis , autoimmune neuropathy ( GuillainBarr ( SqrRoot ) ( Copyright ) syndrome ) , Goodpasture syndrome , ulcerative hemorrhagic colitis , autoimmune hypophysitis/hypopituitarism , autoimmune hemolytic anemia . EXCEPTIONS : Patients history autoimmunity require systemic immunosuppressive therapy threaten vital organ function include CNS , heart , lung , kidney , skin , GI tract exclude . Patients type 1 diabetes mellitus , vitiligo , endocrine deficiency hypothyroidism exclude condition well control . Other active malignancy within past 12 month . EXCEPTIONS : Patients adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix bladder exclude . Patients low intermediaterisk CLL ( Rai stage 0II , Binet stage A B ) without progressive symptomatic disease , monitor without therapy exclude . Clinically significant ( i.e. , active ) cardiovascular disease : cerebral vascular accident/stroke &lt; 6 month prior enrollment , myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month prior enrollment , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( ( Bullet ) NYHA III ) . Pulmonary disease , opinion investigator , may impair patient 's respiratory tolerance study drug ( e.g. , interstitial lung disease , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) . Presence serious lifethreatening intercurrent medical illness . Patients symptomatic progressive ( progression within last 3 month ) brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients history acute diverticulitis , intraabdominal abscess , GI obstruction abdominal carcinomatosis know risk factor bowel perforation . Pregnant woman exclude study , base animal study , ipilimumab potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ipilimumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ipilimumab . Any condition , opinion investigator , would prevent full participation trial ( include longterm followup ) , would interfere evaluation trial endpoint . Receipt chemotherapy investigational agent within 21 day ( 60 day antibodybased therapy ) first plan dose study drug .</criteria>
