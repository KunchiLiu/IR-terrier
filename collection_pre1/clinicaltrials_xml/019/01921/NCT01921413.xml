	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate clinical performance one-step Fyodor Urine Malaria Test ( UMT ) , determine accuracy ( sensitivity specificity ) diagnosis Plasmodium falciparum malaria febrile patient . A total 1500 properly consent child adult present fever ( axillary temperature ≥37.5°C ) history fever last 48 hour ( Group 1 ) , 250 apparently `` healthy '' individual ( Control , Group 2 ) , 50 patient Schistosoma hematobium Rheumatoid arthritis ( Group 3 ) , recruit . Matched urine fingerprick ( capillary ) blood sample collect tested use UMT , Binax NOW® malaria rapid diagnostic test ( blood test ) thick smear microscopy , respectively . The overall agreement UMT result Binax NOW analysis thick smear microscopy use establish UMT sensitivity specificity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Performance Evaluation Fyodor Urine Malaria Test ( UMT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate clinical performance ( sensitivity specificity ) Fyodor UMT detect Plasmodium falciparum malaria febrile patient . Secondary Objectives : - To monitor time-to-clearance cognate parasite protein patient urine - To assess potential effect proteinuria , inflammation anti-fever medication Fyodor UMT performance - To determine UMT performance use asymptomatic ( afebrile ) individual , may carriers parasite . Study Design : - Randomized , multi-center clinical study - Participants recruit primary healthcare center across four local government area Lagos State , two schistosomiasis community Abeokuta-North Local Government Area Ogun State , southwest Nigeria - 1500 participant ( comprise child age 2-14 year adult gender ) fever ( axillary temperature ≥37.5°C ) recent history fever last 48 hour ( Group 1 ) , 250 apparently `` healthy '' individual ( Control , Group 2 ) , 50 patient Schistosoma hematobium Rheumatoid arthritis ( Group 3 ) , recruit - Binax NOW RDT-positive patient treat malaria infection Artesunate-Amodiaquine Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Sulphate , follow national treatment policy - To assess UMT target antigen persist urine treatment , 100 treat Group 1 participant Binax NOW UMT positive result randomly select follow day 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , use adaptation WHO ( 2009 ) Protocol Drug Therapeutic Efficacy Assessments ( http : //whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241597531_eng.pdf ) - To test clinical specificity UMT , active recruitment include 250 individual gender asymptomatic P. falciparum malaria infection ( apparently `` healthy , normal control group 2 ) , 50 Schistosoma haematobium infection and/or rheumatoid arthritis ( Group 3 ) - two unrelated medical condition know elicit proteinuria patient ( Lehman et al. , 1975 ; Adebajo et al. , 1994 ; Tighe &amp; Carson , 1997 ) - Participants elevate Rheumatoid Factor ( RF+ ) test result ( i.e . RF &gt; 60 u/mL &gt; 1:80 liter ) associate severe rheumatoid disease . Schistosoma haematobium infection confirm microscopy egg identification serology - This 6-month study implement July-December 2013 , rainy dry season malaria transmission high low , respectively . Study Area : The study coordinate The ANDI Center Excellence Malaria Diagnosis - International Malaria Microscopy Training &amp; RDT Quality Assurance Testing center , &amp; WHO/TDR/FIND Malaria Specimen Bank Site College Medicine , The University Lagos . It conduct seven primary healthcare facility across four local government area Lagos State . Lagos State situate southwestern part Nigeria , make densely populated urban area sprawl suburban area . Malaria transmission occur throughout year period intense seasonal malaria transmission rainy season . Temperatures usually high water pool create rainy season provide breed site malaria vector , lead epidemic outbreak high morbidity rate . The state endemic malaria , peak transmission April-September . The sample Schistosomiasis carry Imalodo Abuletutu schistosomiasis community Abeokuta-North Local Government Area Ogun State , also southwest Nigeria . Description Study Design : The specific aim study determine clinical sensitivity specificity UMT , establish assay performance characteristic healthy asymptomatic volunteer , compare blood smear microscopy , Binax NOW test ( Predicate device ) . A total 1,800 participant , comprise child adult gender present malaria-like fever symptom , patient unrelated medical condition ( Schistosoma hematobium infection rheumatoid arthritis , well apparently `` healthy '' ( asymptomatic ) control individual enrol . Febrile patient malaria-like symptom enrol rainy dry season , yield field sample period high low malaria transmission . Matched urine fingerprick blood sample collect tested use UMT , Binax NOW microscopy , respectively . Urine blood test UMT Binax NOW , respectively , perform on-site blinded fashion . Each urine sample also test use urinalysis dipstick ' physicochemical characteristic ( pH , protein , sugar , specific gravity , etc ) record . Two thin thick blood smear slide ( prepared slide ) per participant prepare blood specimen . One slide independently read two microscopist ANDI Center Excellence Malaria Diagnosis , internationally repute train referral center malaria microscopy . The second slide archive future quality assurance purpose , thereafter ship Fyodor along remain urine sample . Per convention , microscopic reading blood smear use gold standard malaria diagnosis . Patients test positive Binax NOW treat Artesunate-Amodiaquine Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Sulphate . No clinical decision make base UMT result alone . Nevertheless , standard routine malaria diagnostic test use manage patient facility present . The overall agreement UMT Binax NOW microscopy analysis use establish UMT sensitivity , specificity , substantial equivalence/non-inferiority Binax NOW test . UMT Test Procedure : - Add 200 µl freshly collect urine 1.5 ml 2 ml test tube immediately test - Dip UMT strip urine sample allow sample wick saturate strip 10 minute - Remove strip urine specimen , place foil pouch packaging - Allow reaction proceed 20 minute - Record result positive ( POS ; Test Control Lines appear ) , negative ( NEG ; Control Line appear ) invalid ( INV ; Control Line appear ) . Study Quality Assurance : This study conduct accordance good clinical practice . - Site training : All investigator , technician research staff work UMT study train certified conduct study involve human subject per ICH guideline - Site Visits : Site monitor visit conduct accord guideline outline study protocol - Blinding Results : Separate team organize conduct patient enrollment , laboratory ( Binax NOW ) testing , diagnostic microscopy , data entry , data analysis - Control UMT Testing : Known positive negative control material use verify UMT performance daily basis - Data Collection : Research staff fill data collection form visit , even participant test complete ; miss follow visit document , appropriate , case report form - The Study Coordinator manage field research staff provide administrative support study sit day-to-day basis - Study Quality Assurance Coordinator qualify train experience , monitor conduct trial ensure compliance approve study protocol . This clinical study conduct accordance study protocol approve Research Grants &amp; Experimentation Ethics Committee College Medicine University Lagos , Nigeria , Nigerian Health Research Ethics Committee guideline , ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline Good Clinical Practice 45CFR46 21CFR50 , WHO-FIND-CDC Malaria RDT Product Testing Methods Manual ( Version 3 ) , abbreviate non-significant risk provision Investigational Device Exemptions ( IDE ) Regulations ( 21 CFR Part 812.2 ( b ) ) , Protection Human Subjects Regulations , include Subpart B Informed Consent Human Subjects ( 21 CFR Part 50 ) , Institutional Review Board Regulations ( 21 CFR Part 56 ) ; , Financial Disclosure Clinical Investigators Regulations ( 21 CFR Part 54 ) .</detailed_description>
