	<brief_summary>The research use hydrophilic-based dressing ( KoCarbonTM ) develop Medical Technology Company Limited ( Bio-medical Carbon Technology ; BCT ) investigate wound heal effect activated-carbon-fiber-based wound dress different type wounds.The dress compose three layer . The first layer material polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) weave great breathable ; Second layer , activate carbon fiber cloth , absorption excess tissue fluid , bacteria contamination . It reduce smell wound restrain development bacteria . In addition , activate carbon feature far-infrared anion , promote blood circulation , speed metabolism shorten time wound heal . The third layer polyethlene ( PE ) film , touch wind surface provide anti-adhesion effect . The aim study investigate application dress affect wound heal condition four different type wound , include general traumatic wound , elective surgery wound , diabetes foot ulcer ( level 2 ) chronic wound . Due characteristic great fluid absorption far-infrared feature , hydrophilic-based dressing ( KoCarbonTM ) expect work perfectly improve wound repair condition .</brief_summary>
