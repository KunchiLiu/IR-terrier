	<brief_title>The PROOF Study : The PICC Related Obstruction Of Flow Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To investigate whether BioFlo™ PICC associate reduced incidence catheter-related venous thrombosis ( include symptomatic asymptomatic ) compare another commercially available PICC : Bard® PowerPICC SOLO2® Design : This randomize , multi-center clinical study . The study design two-arm prospectively control trial . Participants randomly assign either study control catheter use 1:1 schema . Enrollment : Four hundred sixteen ( 416 ) patient enrol four ( 4 ) eight ( 8 ) study site order obtain 354 evaluable patient . Study Objectives : The primary objective study investigate incidence catheter-related venous thrombosis patient receive either 5 Fr BioFlo™ PICC catheter control catheter , i.e. , 5 Fr Dual-Lumen PowerPICC SOLO2® catheter . Secondary objective study investigate : - Incidence catheter-related complication , inclusive catheter occlusion , catheter-related infection , technical failure , premature catheter removal - Incidence catheter occlusion ( independently catheter-related complication ) Additionally , economic outcome respect medical resource utilization requirement compare two catheter group ( US sit ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Is indicate PICC base institutional practice 2 . Is ≥ 18 year age 3 . Is expect require use PICC minimum 10 day 4 .

Anticipates presence dialysis grafts ipsilateral intraluminal device , include pacemaker ( exception peripheral IV catheter ) 2 . Has current anticipate hematologic derangement , include : thrombocytopenia history heparininduced thrombocytopenia coagulopathy ( International Normalized Ratio 2.5 great ) establish diagnosis hypercoagulable syndrome ( e.g. , protein C S deficiency , antiphospholipid antibody polycythemia ) require systemic therapeutic anticoagulation ( Note : The following prophylactic treatment allow : subcutaneous heparin enoxaparin sodium injection , concomitant use platelet aggregation inhibitor , e.g. , Plavix/Ticlid/aspirin ) 3 . Has central venoocclusive disease 4 . Has history previous catheterrelated thrombosis 5 . Has arm identify catheterization exhibit follow ( contralateral arm also unsuitable PICC placement base criterion ) : Current ( prior history ) venous thrombosis portion vein catheter expect reside Conditions impede venous return extremity ( paralysis lymphedema mastectomy ) Preexisting skin surface subsurface infection near propose catheter insertion site Anatomical distortion surgery , injury trauma ( e.g. , orthopedic condition compound fracture require reconstructive procedure ) Anatomical irregularity ( structural , vascular , neurological ) may compromise catheter insertion catheter care procedure involve extremity ( e.g. , reflex sympathetic dystrophy ) 6 . Is pregnant lactate 7 . Has previously enrol clinical study , participate another clinical study contraindicative treatment outcome investigation</criteria>
