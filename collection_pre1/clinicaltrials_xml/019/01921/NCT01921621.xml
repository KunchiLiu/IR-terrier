	<brief_title>Proficiency Based Training Surgery - Employing An Arthroscopic Bankart Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Simulation-based skill train propose method augment traditional vivo training surgeon . [ 1 ] Simulation base training still infancy considerable variability United States around world type training configure . [ 2 ] The first successful simulation validation study use proficiency-based progression methodology . [ 3 ] Trainees require demonstrate performance benchmark ( base experience surgeon performance simulator ) complete laparoscopic cholecystectomy vivo . [ 4 ] This approach use arthroscopy . In study propose evaluate utility proficiency base skill train learn perform arthroscopic Bankart repair unidirectional anterior shoulder instability . Proficiency determine use metric base performance level surgeon experience perform arthroscopic Bankart procedure . [ 5 ] Metrics previously identify , operationally define agree upon Arthroscopy Association North America Delphi panel meeting validate . Metrics demonstrate construct validity use define performance benchmark/level proficiency . Group C require train simulator model demonstrate predetermine performance level . At completion train trainee require complete Bankart procedure fresh cadaver shoulder specimen . Operative performance video record subsequently assess two experienced arthroscopic surgeon blind subject identity group . Raters train reliably identify predefined procedural step , error sentinel error inter-rater reliability level r &gt; 0.8 . [ 6 ] Hypothesis : It hypothesize proficiency base progression trainee perform arthroscopic Bankart procedure significantly well fresh cadaver shoulder traditionally trained subject . They also perform significantly good trainee receive exact curricular material , include use simulator , allow progress desire pace requirement demonstrate performance skill proficiency benchmark progress training . Procedure : Three group orthopaedic surgical trainee postgraduate year four five provide online access orientation video demonstrate perform standard arthroscopic Bankart repair . A set baseline assessment 3 group obtain prior begin train include visuospatial , [ 7 ] perceptual , [ 8,9 ] psychomotor evaluation [ 10-13 ] ensure group comparable . The standard training group ( Group A ) progress training would today routine resident course . Groups B C prospectively randomize ( use online randomizer ) respective train condition . Group C study online didactic information demonstrate predefined proficiency criterion . In addition , successful completion proficiency demonstration arthroscopic knot tie requirement proceed simulation base training model . The benchmark establish use knot tie experienced group arthroscopic surgeon . On simulation model continue train proficiency demonstrate . Group C trainees supervise give formative feedback performance experience trainer assessor skill train session . Group B complete curriculum Group C exception free progress training desire pace requirement demonstrate proficiency phase training . Outcome assessment On completion course proper three group trainee require complete Bankart procedure fresh cadaver specimen . They assist experienced orthopaedic surgeon blind subject train group instruct assist ONLY direction study participant . No guidance provide . Their performance video record subsequent analysis . Video raters experience orthopaedic surgeon blind subject ' identity group . Objective assessment intra-operative performance measure use pre-defined performance metric agree upon Arthroscopy Association North America Delphi panel previously demonstrate show construct validity . These include correct step procedure complete , time complete procedure , intra-procedure error sentinel error . Power Calculations Based data derive construct validity study shoulder model follow power calculation estimate obtain Steps complete correctly , Time perform procedure , Errors Sentinel Errors make . Calculations base group size n = 16 , reference mean standard deviation score , Alpha 5 % correspond 95 % Confidence Interval two-tailed statistical test significance . In previous study transfer effectiveness ration ( TER ) 26 - 42 % show novice . [ 13 ] A TER 20 % mean PBP train group would complete 44.88 step procedure comparison control group 37.4 . The statistical power difference 0.99 . A similar magnitude difference ( i.e. , 20 % ) time sentinel error would result mean difference statistical power &gt; 0.8 . Error score would require difference mean score group ~ 40 % reach acceptable level significance . Furthermore , difference would mean PBP trainee still outperform expert . Statistical Analysis The following analysis conduct : 1 . The primary analysis compare intra-operative performance trainee . For subject , number intra-operative step complete , time take , error sentinel error compare across three group one factor analysis variance ( ANOVA ) specific contrast group conduct Scheffe F-tests . 2 . Two-factor ANOVA repeat measure factor one training method factor two anchor number conduct variable list . The sphericity assumption , relate conditional variance pair-wise difference evaluate . Statistical comparison repeat measure placement Anchors 1 - 3 . - Anchor Preparation Insertion step - Anchor Preparation Insertion Errors - Suture Delivery Management Steps - Suture Delivery Management Errors - Knot Tying Steps - Knot Tying Errors Baseline Aptitude Performance Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient Multiple Regression Analysis use assess strength relationship trainee ' performance individual combine baseline assessment objectively assess performance Bankart procedure . The type analysis use assess strength relationship knowledge start course Bankart procedure performance .</detailed_description>
