	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety different dose ARRY-380 combination trastuzumab . Trastuzumab FDA approve drug treatment HER2 metastatic breast cancer . However , combination ARRY-380 trastuzumab yet test . Both agent block HER2 receptor , think overactive HER2-positive breast cancer . It think ARRY-380 trastuzumab might work together attach different part HER2 receptor prevent functioning . Because HER2 positive breast cancer contain high level HER2 receptor , normal cell body generally , drug may able `` target '' cancer cell . In addition , laboratory study , ARRY-380 appear penetration brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient participates research study , patient receive ARRY-380 drug-dosing diary record patient take ARRY-380 study treatment cycle . Each study treatment cycle last 3 week ( 21 day ) time patient take ARRY-380 mouth every day . At time patient enters study , patient assign either Arm A Arm B . The difference two study arm include ARRY-380 administer twice-daily ( morning evening - Arm A ) once-daily ( morning - Arm B ) . The patient also give Trastuzumab intravenous infusion ( vein ) day 1 cycle ( dose schedule study arm ) . The dose trastuzumab everyone study , standard approve dose medication . In first portion study , investigator examine effect different dose ARRY-380 give combination trastuzumab . Initially , 3 participant treat low dose ARRY-380 combination standard dose trastuzumab . If dose cause intolerable side effect , participant may receive drug combination dose . The patient inform assign dose patient enters study . The patient ask take ARRY-380 long study treatment possible benefit patient . After patient finish take ARRY-380 , study doctor ask patient visit office follow-up exam least one visit within 4 week patient 's last study treatment . At start cycle patient : - A medical history , include question health , current medication , allergy . - Performance status , evaluate ability carry usual activity . - Physical examination , doctor examine patient body , include measure height , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure , body temperature , pulse rate breathe rate ) . - A neurological examination asses neurological symptom ( example , difficulty balance ) - Blood test draw begin study treatment cycle test monitor function liver kidney check blood cell count . In addition , blood test draw day 4 , 8 , 15 first cycle study treatment monitor liver function . Periodically patient undergo : - The patient brain MRI every two cycle . If brain scan stable improve patient study 6 month longer , frequency body scan decrease every 4 cycle . The patient also CT MRI scan body end cycle 2 , cycle 4 every 4 cycle thereafter . The research doctor may ask patient bone scan time point clinically indicate . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , show electrical activity heart . It perform Day 1 cycle 2 . - Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) ( ultrasound heart ) MUGA scan ( test heart function use small amount radioactive substance ) . This performed every 3-4 month . Additional research procedure perform : - On Cycle 1 , Day 15 blood ( `` PK '' ) pharmacokinetic ( body drug ) sample draw morning dose ARRY-380 , 2 hour six hour . - Blood test research , include 2 tablespoon blood collect cycle 1 come study treatment . In general term , scientist study gene , RNA , proteins find blood sample . Scientists also measure characterize circulate tumor cell blood , present . In addition , specimen may test new type test , become available . Results research test blood report back patient . - Archival Tumor Tissue Sample : A sample ( sample ) patient 's tumor tissue ( past surgery and/or biopsy ) collect use learn development metastatic breast cancer . In general term , scientist study gene , RNA , proteins find breast tumor normal tissue . In addition , specimen may test new type test , become available . Laboratory-based investigator conduct research access patient identification information name medical record number . Results research test tissue report back patient . After final dose study drug : The patient follow-up visit one month come study treatment . During visit , patient physical examination , functional assessment , assessment toxicity current medication . If patient continue ongoing side effect relate study treatment , investigator continue follow patient side effect resolve . If patient withdrew study another reason tumor progression , patient continue follow tumor progression . Planned Follow-up : The investigator would like keep track patient 's medical condition indefinitely . The investigator would like either see patient clinic contact patient patient 's primary doctor periodically see patient . Keeping touch patient check patient 's condition periodically help investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>

Nonlaboratory test must perform within 30 day study entry . Evaluation LVEF must perform within 60 day study entry : Participants must histologically confirm HER2+ ( 3+ immunohistochemistry and/or FISH ratio &gt; /= 2.0 ) invasive breast cancer . Central confirmation HER2 status require . Participants must measurable CNS disease , define least one parenchymal brain lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 10 mm local radiology review ( note : measurable nonCNS disease NOT require study participation ) . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . New progressive CNS lesion , assess patient 's treating physician . It anticipate participant may multiple progressive CNS lesion , one several treat SRS surgery residual untreated lesion remain . Such participant eligible enrollment study provide least one untreated lesion measurable , define section 3.1.2 . The location measurable lesion document patient chart case report form . Participants prior cranial surgery eligible , provide evidence measurable residual progressive lesion . If patient surgical resection follow WBRT , must evidence progressive CNS disease completion WBRT . Participants prior WBRT and/or SRS whose lesion progress thereafter also eligible . In case , lesion treat SRS may consider target lesion unequivocal evidence , opinion treat physician , progression follow SRS . Participants previously treat cranial radiation ( e.g . WBRT SRS ) eligible enter study , participant must asymptomatic CNS metastasis require corticosteroid . No increase corticosteroid dose week prior baseline brain MRI .
