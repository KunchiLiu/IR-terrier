	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ( CVVHDF ) Using Commercial Citrate-containing Replacement Fluid ( Prismocitrate 18/0 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury common critically ill patient , continuous renal replacement therapy preferable mode treatment remove metabolic waste avoid hemodynamic instability associate intermittent hemodialysis . Thrombosis frequently occur hemofilter could reduce circuit lifespan , jeopardize efficacy renal replacement , result loss blood cell increase transfusion requirement . Anticoagulants include conventional heparin low molecular weight heparin , introduce via arterial port circuit , widely use reduce clot within extracorporeal circuit . However , significant amount heparin remove circuit carry patient 's circulation , could lead bleed complication . Regional citrate anticoagulation ( RCA ) use intermittent haemodialysis since 1983 , use extend continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) since 1987 . Citrate introduce therapeutic level arterial limb dialysis circuit , chelate calcium ion blood prevent clot within hemofilter . While calcium-citrate complex remove filter , residual circulate patient metabolize liver . Patient 's systemic ionized calcium level remain normal , hemodilution also calcium replacement . Therefore , anticoagulant effect citrate regional confined extracorporeal circuit . RCA potential extend circuit life renal replacement therapy without systemic anticoagulation . In recent meta-analysis randomize controlled trial , RCA efficacious heparin anticoagulation term maintain circuit function , RCA associate decrease risk bleed significant increase incidence metabolic alkalosis . ( 5 ) Hypocalcemia common patient receive citrate , note , clinical adverse event report included study . Although citrate anticoagulation repeatedly demonstrate prolong filter life , many hospital still refrain use , result limit experience , different patient variety , reason . The investigator ' group perform pilot study ( HKU/HA HKW IRB No : UW 08-221 ) ass efficacy safety continuous venous-venous hemodiafiltration ( CVVHDF ) use commercial citrate contain replacement fluid ( Prismocitrate 10/2 , Gambro ) contain 10mmol/l citrate 2 mmol/l citric acid . 15 subject recruit July 2008 June 2011 . No serious adverse event report , include severe hypocalcemia , hypercalcemia , citrate toxicity severe acid base disturbance . Metabolic acidosis due renal failure partially correct CRRT citrate anticoagulation initial study subject , problem subsequently solve add supplemental bicarbonate dialysate . Since , patient able complete treatment protocol adequate kidney lifespan , correction metabolic abnormality fluid imbalance . However , since additional bicarbonate need correct metabolic acidosis CRRT , room improvement regard formulation citrate-containing solution reduce acid liberation increase alkali bicarbonate production . Prismocitrate 18/0 , contain 18mmol/l citrate ( one mmol citrate could metabolize produce 3 mmol bicarbonate ) citric acid , could potentially result good acid-base control CRRT .</detailed_description>
