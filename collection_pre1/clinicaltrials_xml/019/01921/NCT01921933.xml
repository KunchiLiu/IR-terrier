	<brief_summary>The objective study assess performance safety Optiflow Anastomotic Connector ( Optiflow ) use facilitate creation autogenous arteriovenous fistula ( AVF ) anastomose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Optiflow Patency Maturation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation design multi-center , prospective , single-arm , clinical study Optiflow performance safety maximum 180 subject include one ( 1 ) roll-in subject per investigator ( maximum 36 roll-in subject ) . Subjects follow 14 day post-procedure , 42 day post-procedure , 90 day post-procedures . Results compare pre-established performance goal . Up fifteen ( 15 ) investigational site participate investigational study . The primary performance endpoint overall maturation percentage rate 90 day . Maturation define access site achieves diameter great equal 4 mm blood flow great equal t0 500 mL/min measure via duplex ultrasound . The primary safety endpoint composite endpoint serious adverse event know associate arteriovenous fistula anastomosis surgical procedure 90 day .</detailed_description>
