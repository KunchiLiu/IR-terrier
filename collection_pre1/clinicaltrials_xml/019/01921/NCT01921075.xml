	<brief_summary>The main goal present study provide technical basis future study assess role cardiac lipid . More specifically , non-invasive MR-Spectroscopy ( MRS ) technique use study : 1. assess methodological reproducibility MRS-measurements cardiac lipid human 2. investigate physiological variation cardiac lipid measure day-to-day change identical condition 3. determine diurnal variation cardiac lipid human</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Obesity well know risk factor development glucose intolerance , type 2 diabetes mellitus , consequently , diabetic complication like cardiovascular disease . Importantly , obesity associate lipid accumulation adipose tissue ( orthotopic fat deposition ) , also non-adipose tissue ( ectopic fat deposition ) . Clinical study repetitively show muscular hepatic lipid accumulation well elevated visceral adipose tissue associate development central peripheral insulin resistance . In addition , recent data animal study show increase evidence two organ , heart pancreas , may also involve pathophysiological process reduce insulin sensitivity . While reduced insulin secretion course type 2 diabetes well document , importance pancreatic fat deposition early step process recently suggest base animal model . Conversely , ischemic heart disease one dangerous complication diabetes mellitus , prevention thereby cornerstone current diabetes management . Recent data suggest change lipid metabolism heart associate epi- myocardial lipid deposition may earliest sign diabetic cardiopathy . Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging ( MRI ) -Spectroscopy ( MRS ) among versatile method non-invasive study human tissue and/or metabolism vivo situ . The excellent soft tissue contrast MRI already lead implementation method assessment whole body lipid accumulation , whereas MRS successfully apply study lipid metabolism skeletal muscle liver . The extended application method towards heart pancreas allow comprehensive investigation orthotopic ectopic fat deposition human association development insulin resistance diabetes mellitus . The methodological part study focus physiologic plasticity cardiac lipid order ass : ) methodological reproducibility ii ) intra-individual physiological reproducibility measure day-to-day variation well variation day . Objective ) Adapting optimize single-voxel MRS sequence currently use muscle liver , respiratory cardiac double-triggering enables spectroscopy cardiac muscle . ii ) Validate methodology different standardize physiologic condition . Methods Cardiac lipid determine five independent MR-examinations distribute two day separate one two week . Both day include measurement morning overnight fast ( &gt; 8h ) one afternoon ( 8h breakfast , 3.5h lunch ) . To determine methodological reproducibility , afternoon measurement repeat one two day ( 1h break ) . Preparation volunteer include perpetuation normal diet , restricted physical activity two preceding day . Cardiac lipid determine single-voxel MR-Spectroscopy .</detailed_description>
