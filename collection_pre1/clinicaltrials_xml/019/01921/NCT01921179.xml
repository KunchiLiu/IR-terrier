	<brief_summary>One pressing concern within VA currently provision intervention address cognitive well emotional problem face Veterans concurrent mild TBI PTSD . One purpose study learn PTSD mild brain injury influence people think , act , feel . This may include people pay attention , keep information memory , organize plan achieve important goal , manage stress . Another purpose research learn effect cognitive training thinking , behavior , emotion individual PTSD mild brain injury - short- long-term . With research , investigator hope good understand treat cognitive emotional difficulty occur due PTSD mild brain injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rehabilitation Executive Functioning Veterans With PTSD Mild TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim proposal investigate potential short long term effectiveness cognitive training program Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-regulation ( GOALS ) target executive control function Veterans co-morbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , history mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) , cognitive difficulty . Both PTSD history mild TBI prevalent Veterans Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) conflict , report rate disorder range 14 - 22 % . Both PTSD TBI associate cognitive dysfunction may lead functional impairment poor community reintegration . PTSD highly debilitate due emotional dysregulation , also due deficit cognitive control process . Goal-Oriented Attentional Self-Regulation ( GOALS ) therapist administer cognitive rehabilitation train target executive control function apply mindfulness-based attention regulation goal management , link participant-defined real-life goal . In prior study individual chronic brain injury , train improved cognitive performance area complex attention / executive function , memory , complex functional task performance , daily functioning . Furthermore , functional MRI result train indicated significantly enhance modulation neural processing extrastriate cortex change prefrontal cortex . Preliminary result recently complete study Veterans history chronic TBI also support improvement post GOALS neuropsychological measure attention executive function , performance complex 'real-life ' task , self-report measure functional performance . Furthermore , participant also show improvement emotional regulation self-report measure . These finding suggest improve cognitive control may also improve function domain emotional regulation functional performance daily life . In randomized , control intervention study design , 42 Veterans diagnosis PTSD , history mTBI residual cognitive difficulty participate experimental ( GOALS ) , and/or active comparison ( Brain Health Education - EDU ) intervention match time intensity . Participants randomize start either 5 week GOALS EDU training . Those begin EDU cross-over GOALS , begin GOALS 5 week self-driven practice . Both group participate pre post intervention measurement baseline , week 5 10 . Long-term follow-up 6 month . Pre- post-intervention measurement include performance untrained : neuro-cognitive test assess target non-targeted cognitive domain , complex functional task performance low structure 'real-world ' setting , self-report measure emotional regulation daily function .</detailed_description>
