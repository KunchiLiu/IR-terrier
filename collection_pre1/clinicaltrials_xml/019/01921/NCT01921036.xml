The IN patient perform supervise endurance resistance exercise approximately 90 minute week traditional cardiac rehabilitation ( TCR ) week ; UC patient perform TCR twice week . The intervention plan six month follow-up six month . The primary investigation difference IN UC regard change exercise capacity ( max watt/kgBW ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The DOPPELHERZ ( The influence individualize resistance-endurance exercise training maximal power output outpatient cardiac rehabilitation ) randomize control trial perform Department Prevention Sports Medicine , Klinikum rechts der Isar Munich , Germany . 70 patient eligible and/or participate cardiac rehabilitation randomize six month individualize combined exercise group ( ICE ) group- base cardiac rehabilitation ( GCR ) , consider usual care patient population . All patient give write informed consent , study protocol approve local university hospital ethic committee , procedure conduct accord Declaration Helsinki . Participants : All patient American Heart Association Class `` C '' ( moderate high risk ) base presence cardiac disease maximal power output &lt; 5 METs ( correspond &lt; 1.4 W/kg body weight ) , meet eligibility criterion CR time recruitment . Patients decompensated highly symptomatic ( NYHA IV ) heart failure , acute illness injury , cardiac hospitalization within six week inclusion , drug abuse , unstable blood pressure arrhythmia , high grade valve stenosis instable diabetes mellitus exclude . Primary endpoint : The primary endpoint change maximal relative power output ( W/kg ) measure CPX six month . Exercise train program In intervention usual care arm study , exercise train prescribe twice weekly period six month , exercise session lead certified exercise instructor monitor physician . Group-based cardiac rehabilitation ( GCR ) : The GCR group perform regular exercise state-sanctioned cardiac rehabilitation group . This form GCR consider Phase III aftercare describe elsewhere9 . Briefly , GCR patient receive moderate-intensity heart rate target exercise cardiologist base CPX result . The group-based program offer 90 minute twice week combination gymnastics ( include endurance resistance component ) , coordination flexibility exercise , include educational component target diet nutrition , stress relaxation , method cop CVD behavioral lifestyle change . The GCR session conduct local university gymnasium perform group 15 participant , recommended German Federal Association Rehabilitation . Individualized combine exercise ( ICE ) : The ICE group participate once-weekly individualized combine resistance-endurance exercise training 60 minute once-weekly traditional group-based cardiac rehabilitation describe . The ICE intervention include 30 minute endurance exercise 60-70 % VO2peak RPE 11-14 five resistance exercise ( chest press , leg press , lat pull-downs , shoulder press seat cable row ) follow recommendation German Federation Cardiovascular Prevention Rehabilitation ( DGPR ) target large muscle group RPE &lt; 16 . For first three month , patient perform two set 12-25 repetition 30-50 % 1RM ; three month patient retested thereafter perform two set 8-15 repetition 40-60 % 1RM . The ICE session locate university sport medicine rehabilitation center perform group four patient . They instruct maximum 2:1 participant therapist ratio .</detailed_description>
