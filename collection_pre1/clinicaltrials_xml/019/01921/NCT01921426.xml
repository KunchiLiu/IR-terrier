	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , tolerability , high dose GC4419 give patient squamous cell cancer head neck receive standard radiation therapy chemotherapy . This study also evaluate GC4419 following : - Effect incidence severity radiation induce oral mucositis ; - Effect response rate squamous cell cancer head neck receive radiation therapy chemotherapy ; - Total concentration GC4419 achieve blood ; - Changes proteins genetics associated oral mucositis ; - Impact delayed toxicity radiation ( dry mouth reduce ability fully open mouth ) ; - Observe change genetic molecular marker oral mucositis ; - Observe usage extra health resource ( e.g. , unplanned ER visit , feed tube use , etc . ) study patient ; - Assess overall quality life study patient oral mucositis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study GC4419 Combination With Chemoradiation Squamous Cell Cancer Head &amp; Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , single-agent , open-label clinical trial conduct serial cohort patient squamous cell cancer head neck receive escalate dos GC4419 combination standard chemoradiation . The study follow standard 3+3 cohort design typical phase I clinical trial , 3 patient initially enter give dose level observe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . For purpose manage dose escalation , DLT observation window define first dose GC4419 24 hour follow last dose GC4419 individual patient . If zero three patient dose cohort experience DLT DLT observation window , enrollment next high dose level begin . If 1 3 patient experience DLT within DLT observation window , 3 additional patient add dose level . If DLTs observe 3 additional patient , dose escalation resume enrollment next high dose level . If ≥2 patient cohort experience DLT within DLT observation window , dose consider exceeded MTD . The MTD define high dose ≤ 1 6 patient experience DLT DLT observation period . Decisions expand dose cohort proceed dose escalation make review safety data dose level Sponsor collaboration investigator appropriately qualified consultant , need . Planned dose level 15 , 30 , 50 , 75 , 112 , 150 , 175 , 210 , 250 mg/day , subsequent dose increment 50 mg/day , data warrant MTD determine . These dose level represent maximum dose escalation increment . At time , ongoing review safety data warrant , intermediate dose level may study ( 3-6 patient enrol per dose level ) . These intermediate dose level may select next plan dose level two dose level previously study . If MTD determine 250 mg dose level , dose escalation may undertake increment 50 mg/day . Initial dose escalation proceed treatment schedule wherein GC4419 administer prior IMRT first 14 scheduled day IMRT . Separate dose cohort also study wherein GC4419 administer first 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 day IMRT ( four , five , six , seven week Active Treatment ) . Daily dose GC4419 schedule begin dose show exceed MTD original , 14-dose schedule . Further dose level may select follow plan dose level guideline ( include possible intermediate dose level ) rule determine MTD 14-dose schedule . At give daily dose level , extension dose period may undertake increment one week ( 5 dos , M-F ) per cohort , successive cohort . For example , dose 20 dos ( 4 week ) may proceed give dose level MTD exceed daily dose give 14 dos ; , dose 25 dos ( 5 week ) may proceed give daily dose level MTD exceed daily dose give 20 dos ( 4 week ) ; etc . Note , cohort treatment duration , DLT observation period extend 24 hour last GC4419 dose individual patient . Note also extension dose duration escalation daily dose step permit . In addition , separate dose cohort may concurrently enrol receive 30 mg/day , M-F , 35 dos ( 7 week ) , base calculation total dose administer give patient ( 1050 mg ) exceed total dose receive 3 patient 75 mg/d x 14 dos ( 1050 mg ) , previously determine safe ( i.e. , without patient experienced DLT ) . If dose schedule exceed MTD define protocol , enrollment additional 7-week dosing cohort may undertake apply total dose approach future dose level administer &lt; 7 week without exceed MTD . On 14-day schedule , miss dos GC4419 may make prior study day 28 . On schedule employ administration GC4419 20 dos , M-F , GC4419 dose make . On schedule , additional patient may study dose level exceed MTD characterize safety , pharmacokinetics , potential efficacy GC4419 dose level . At least one recommend Phase 2 dose , least one schedule , identify GC4419 . More one dose may identify assessment exposure/response relationship . Dose ( ) recommend study MTD , exposure preliminary efficacy data suggesting may warrant investigation safety efficacy . Treatment administer outpatient basis . Supportive care measure include direct control symptom result patient 's malignancy allow discretion treat investigator . Pharmacokinetic sample obtain patient . Primary Objectives : 1 . To assess safety tolerability GC4419 administer standard chemoradiation , observation frequency severity adverse event study regimen 2 . To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose/Recommended Phase 2 dose schedule GC4419 study administer combination standard chemoradiation patient squamous cell cancer mouth oropharynx Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine pharmacokinetic profile GC4419 administer combination standard chemoradiation 2 . To determine incidence , severity , time first onset duration oral mucositis patient receive GC4419 administer combination standard chemoradiation 3 . To preliminarily assess tumor response standard chemoradiation administer conjunction GC4419 Exploratory Objectives : 1 . To determine pharmacodynamic effect GC4419 2 . To correlate pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic effect GC4419 incidence , severity time first onset oral mucositis 3 . To evaluate potential synergistic effect GC4419 chemoradiation tumor response use pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis 4 . To evaluate effect GC4419 specific late toxicity ( xerostomia trismus ) standard chemoradiation 5 . To collect information health resource utilization 6 . To collect information health-related quality life ( Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire )</detailed_description>
