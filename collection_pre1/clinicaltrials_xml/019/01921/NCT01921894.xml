	<brief_summary>This study vitamin D design assess safety efficacy potential dos ( 2,000 IU/day 4,000 IU/day ) raise vitamin D level normal range short period time ( e.g . 4 week less ) compare 200 IU/day . In child vitamin D insufficiency deficiency risk severe asthma exacerbation , hypothesize vitamin D supplementation 4,000 IU/day 2,000 IU/day safely achieve normal vitamin D level , high dose ( 4,000 IU/day ) result large proportion subject achieve level 4 8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Asthma major public health problem United States worldwide . Severe disease exacerbation account majority cost attributable asthma United States . Vitamin D essential nutrient significant immuno-modulatory effect . The observation vitamin D insufficiency asthma share risk factor urban residence , obesity , African American ethnicity generate significant interest explore link two condition . This 8-week randomized , double-masked , controlled trial vitamin D3 ( 2,000 IU/day 4,000 IU/day ) achieve vitamin D sufficiency ( serum 25 ( OH ) D ≥30 ng/ml 60 school-aged child ( age 6 14 year ) vitamin D insufficiency ( serum 25 ( OH ) D &lt; 30 ng/ml ) risk severe asthma exacerbation , whose asthma well-controlled medium-dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) end 4-week run-in period .</detailed_description>
