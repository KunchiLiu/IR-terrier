	<brief_summary>External beam radiotherapy ( RT ) one standard curative treatment option patient prostate cancer ( PC ) . Several randomised trial show excellent long-term biochemical outcome high radiation dos . Nowadays , RT PC commonly consist deliver 74-80 Gy 2 Gy fraction , result overall treatment time 7-8 week . The sensitivity different tissue fractionation change quantify α/β ratio linear-quadratic model . Dose-response analysis PC patient treat external beam RT brachytherapy lead hypothesis α/β ratio PC lower tumor approach value characteristic late responding tissue . Values 1.2 3.9 Gy calculate . If α/β ratio PC indeed low , hypofractionating RT treatment theoretically maintain high bioequivalent tumor dos , shorten overall treatment time decrease late toxicities.The advantage term patient convenience treatment cost obvious . There level I evidence show hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule least equivalent biochemical outcome small increase acute late toxicity compare conventional fractionation RT schedule . Results different hypofractionation schedule report , however optimal hypofractionation clear far . In randomised trial would like compare 2 different radiotherapyschedules : 16 fraction à rato 4 fraction week versus 25 fraction à rato 5 fraction week . The incidence acute toxicity early late toxicity ( i.e . within 2 year post radiotherapy ) impact quality life registrated compare . The study perform 2 stage . For stage 1 , sample size calculate rule upper limit 40 % patient RTOG grade 2 bad bowel ( GI ) complication expect rate 25 % , base one-stage Fleming-A'Hern design . A power 83.0 % ( alpha level 0.038 one-sided ) obtain include 72 patient per group ( 144 patient total ) . If 22 patient 72 grade 2 bad GI complication , study arm reject . To allow dropout 10 % , 160 patient include stage 1 . Sample size stage 2 calculate analogously allow rule upper limit 35 % patient RTOG grade 2 bad GI complication expect rate 25 % . When include 155 patient per group ( 310 total ) power 85.7 % ( alpha level 0.049 one-sided ) obtain . If 45 patient 155 grade 2 bad GI complication , study arm reject . The sample size stage 1 stage 2 combine set 346 ( 173 per group ) , 10 % allowance dropout .</brief_summary>
