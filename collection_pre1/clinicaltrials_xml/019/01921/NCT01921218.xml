	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety effectiveness belatacept ( Nulojix® ) prevent antibody formation patient chronic fail kidney transplant . This study randomize study first-time kidney transplant patient worsen kidney function biopsy proven grade 2 3 interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy ( IF/TA ) . Patients must eligible get second transplant . They must complete actively undergoing evaluation re-listing second transplant . Patients randomize either convert belatacept continue calcineurin inhibitor-based therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study test safety effectiveness medicine belatacept ( Nulojix® ) prevent antibody form people fail kidney transplant . Kidney transplant patient take immunosuppression medicine prevent kidney rejection . When kidney transplant begin fail , immunosuppression medicine slowly wean . Once dialysis start , immunosuppressant medicine usually stop . After immunosuppression stop , people form antibody . Antibodies proteins immune system make protect harmful foreign substance like bacteria , virus , foreign tissue , like transplant . High level antibody make hard find kidney donor person . Participants randomize one two treatment group . One group continue take current immunosuppression medicine . The people treatment group switch belatacept ( Nulojix® ) . Belatacept ( Nulojix® ) immunosuppression medicine approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) prevent rejection kidney transplant . Participants stop take calcineurin inhibitor ( either cyclosporine tacrolimus ) sirolimus keep take immunosuppression medicine like Cellcept ( MMF ) azathioprine ( Imuran ) prednisone . These medicine slowly wean stop participant start dialysis . Participants continue take belatacept ( Nulojix® ) , even dialysis . The study team test group see many people group develop antibody .</detailed_description>
