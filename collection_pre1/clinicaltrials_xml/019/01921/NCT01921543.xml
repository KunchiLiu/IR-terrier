	<brief_summary>The main aim trial investigate whether patient suffer treatment refractory- Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) benefit DBS ( Deep Brain Stimulation ) brain area know inferior thalamic peduncle ( ITP ) and/or Capsula Interna/Bed nucleus stria terminalis ( CI/BNST )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation Treatment Refractory Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim investigate effect deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . After implantation DBS system , effect deep brain stimulation ITP CI/BNST evaluate . The design study consist two consecutive crossover phase , interspaced 2 optimalisation episode . After period optimalisation CI/BNST stimulation parameter , patient randomise two group . Half group patient receive stimulation CI/BNST . The half . After one week group switch condition period one week . This give idea effect stimulation CI/BNST outcome measure . Outcome measure evaluate week . After first crossover patient continue optimalisation phase ITP stimulation parameter . A second crossover follow . The effect ITP stimulation , CI/BNST stimulation stimulation compare . In phase patient randomise receive one six possible combination three consecutive period two month three different stimulation condition ( ITP stimulation , CI/BNST stimulation stimulation ) . Evaluations outcome measure perform blind evaluator . This design limit duration period severly ill patient stimulate .</detailed_description>
