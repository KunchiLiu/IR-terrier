	<brief_summary>This single-center , prospective sample collection study . Samples use establish performance characteristic myo-inositol oxygenase ( MIOX ) aid early diagnosis acute renal injury ( AKI ) follow cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIOX Early Detection Acute Kidney Injury After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 100 adult schedule undergo cardiac surgery involve use cardiopulmonary bypass eligible enrollment study . Blood urine sample obtain patient study future measurement MIOX creatinine concentration sample follow time point : - Baseline ( within 24 hour prior start surgery ) - Immediately follow cardiopulmonary bypass ( time 0 ) , 3 ( ± 1 ) , 6 ( ± 2 ) , 12 ( +/-2 ) 18 ( ± 2 ) , 24 ( ± 2 ) hour follow cardiopulmonary bypass . Urine lithium heparin anti-coagulated blood collect time point . Blood urine sample immediately centrifuge , aliquoted , frozen -80oC prior analysis . Samples store analyzed Washington University School Medicine . The result assessment blind medical team study impact medical management patient . Serum creatinine measurement obtain medical team part routine care pre-operatively post-operatively well additional post-operative renal insult , development oliguria , need nephrology consultation , length intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay , initiation dialysis mortality record Day 10 . Patients follow throughout hospital stay , average expect 10 day . The statistical analysis evaluate correlation plasma urine MIOX ( absolute change baseline ) parameter indicative renal injury ( e.g. , increase plasma creatinine Day 5 development oliguria , need nephrology consult initiation dialysis Day 10 ) . These result assist establish sensitivity specificity plasma urine MIOX detection meaningful kidney injury follow cardiopulmonary bypass surgery .</detailed_description>
