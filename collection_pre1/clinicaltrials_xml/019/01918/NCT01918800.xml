	<detailed_description>Treatment MS-related fatigue represent significant challenge provide symptomatic therapy people MS . In 1998 MS Council Clinical Practice Guidelines publish Fatigue MS , first evidence base treatment guideline MS recommend comprehensive treatment fatigue . This guideline widely distribute , include program implementation . Fatigue : Take Control , first formal program model MS fatigue guideline . This proposal entail perform four-center single blind intent-to-treat randomize control two-arm parallel design trial Fatigue : Take Control MS participant accomplish three Specific Aims . Specific Aim # 1 : Demonstrate Fatigue : Take Control reduce fatigue people MS ambulatory depress end intervention three six month intervention compare general MS group education program . The primary outcome measure Modified Fatigue Impact Scale ( MFIS ) choose multi-dimensional nature , recommend use Fatigue MS guideline sensitivity change pilot study . Specific Aim # 2 : Demonstrate Fatigue : Take Control increase self-efficacy people MS ambulatory severely depressed . Fatigue affect person 's sense control his/her life . The investigator use MS Self Efficacy Scale ( MSSE ) secondary objective . This measure also demonstrate improvement pilot study . Specific Aim # 3 : Demonstrate Fatigue : Take Control result change medication utilization , exercise participation , sleep health-related quality life people MS ambulatory depress . Fatigue affect body functions/structure , activity participation aspect daily life . Fatigue : Take Control created expectation fatigue reduce guiding individual make environmental , behavioral lifestyle change necessary manage MS fatigue . This objective explore important secondary cause fatigue impact health-related quality life identify participant change : time walk use time walk 25 foot ( T25-FW ) , medication utilization use self-report medication diary , exercise participation use self-report Rapid Assessment Physical Activity ( RAPA ) , sleep quality use Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) change overall health-related quality life use SF-36 .</detailed_description>
