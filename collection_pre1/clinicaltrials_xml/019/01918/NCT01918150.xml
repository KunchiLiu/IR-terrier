	<brief_title>Comparative Phase IV Study : Efficacy And Safety TiTAN2 Versus COBALT-CHROME Stents- EVIDENCEII</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The EVIDENCE II trial post-registration study TITAN2 stent initiate request French Health Authorities ' ( HAS ) June 2009 next renewal registration list reimbursable product service France . The study design compare effectiveness safety 24 month TiTAN2 versus Cobalt-Chromium BMS randomly assign . As part secondary objective , cost-effectiveness study also plan . The comparators cobalt chromium stent CE market free coating ( nude BMS ) . All use authorized indication . A total 1350 patient include period year follow 24 month primary endpoint ( MACE rate 24 month overall population : cumulative incidence cardiac death , MI target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) ) . Patients also clinically follow 6 12 month . Medico economic data collect similar time point . An independent Clinical Event Committee , unaware treatment allocation , charge adjudication cardiac event include MACE ( main objective ) collect . The calculation number subject specifies 1350 patient need meet primary endpoint study . Enrolled patient randomly assign 2:1 fashion follow : - 900 patient TITAN2 arm include 360 ACS ( Arm A ) - 450 patient Cobalt-chromium arm include 180 ACS ( Arm B ) In case one stent need , protocol mandate use stent one assign lesion treat .</detailed_description>
