	<brief_title>Walnut Oral Immunotherapy Tree Nut Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our central hypothesis tree nut allergic subject multiple tree nut allergy experience clinical desensitization immunologic evidence shift towards tolerance induction multiple tree nut treat OIT walnut protein alone . We address hypothesis investigation focus follow objective : Objective # 1 : Examine role specific OIT walnut protein induction clinical desensitization tree nut . Objective # 2 : Determine role specific OIT walnut protein induction clinical desensitization walnut . Objective # 3 : Determine change tree nut specific immune parameter associate OIT related clinical desensitization shift towards oral tolerance . Primary Objective : To examine effectiveness walnut OIT clinical desensitization second tree nut ( designate `` test tree nut '' ) cause allergy compare placebo treatment . The primary outcome objective change baseline OFC cumulative dose reach desensitization OFC test tree nut . Purpose expectation : This objective design test feasibility effectiveness use walnut OIT desensitize subject tree nut allergy ( ) . We expect demonstrate effectiveness walnut OIT show subject walnut OIT negative double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) second tree nut follow completion ~38 week course walnut OIT . We also expect compare placebo OIT , walnut OIT induce significant decrease : 1 ) wheal ( swell ) size skin prick test second tree nut , 2 ) serum-specific IgE second tree nut , 3 ) adverse effect accidental tree nut ingestion 4 ) increase tree nut specific IgG4 . The study Objective # 1 determine feasibility utilize walnut OIT tree nut allergic subject . At present , strict dietary avoidance food allergen ready access self-injectable epinephrine standard care food allergy . However , method care work well subject tree nut allergy . The ubiquity tree nut contain food make possibility inadvertent ingestion great ; moreover , child adult often circumstance epinephrine injection would prove logistically difficult . If , however , demonstrate walnut OIT effective reduce life-threatening reaction tree nut allergic individual , treatment would provide immediate feasible prevention option avert potentially life-threatening reaction accidental tree nut exposure ( desensitization ) . Additionally , treatment may also provide avenue cause tree nut allergic individual lose allergic reactivity tree nut ( tolerance ) . Secondary Objectives : Objective # 2 : Determine role specific OIT walnut protein induction clinical desensitization walnut . Through Objective # 2 , determine effectiveness walnut OIT induction clinical desensitization walnut . Prior study demonstrate ability change threshold allergen need induce anaphylaxis specific food , include egg peanut . We anticipate walnut OIT provide protection anaphylaxis ( i.e. , clinical desensitization ) walnut subject proven clinical reactivity walnut protein . If walnut OIT prove effective induce desensitization , treatment would provide useful feasible option prevent life-threatening reaction would specific walnut allergic subject . Additionally , may able induce clinical tolerance subset walnut allergic subject use OIT approach . Objective # 3 : Determine change tree nut specific immune parameter associate OIT related clinical desensitization shift towards oral tolerance . Through Objective # 3 , seek understand molecular process walnut OIT affect immune system evaluation immune mechanism relationship clinical finding desensitization and/or tolerance . We delineate impact walnut OIT subsequent cellular humoral response walnut protein follow : 1 ) analysis walnut second tree nut specific IgE , IgG IgG4 response , 2 ) characterization allergen specific basophil activation , 3 ) characterization mast cell response skin prick testing , 4 ) analysis specific T cell cytokine responses regulatory T cell activation . We anticipate effect walnut OIT occur either induction regulatory T cell , conversion T cell allergic ( Th2 ) non-allergic ( Th1 ) lymphocyte response ( measure cytokine , antibody level , skin prick test size ) , change walnut-specific basophil activation . Our expectation balance immunoglobulin isotype response ( IgE , IgG , IgG4 ) reflective antigen-specific immune response occur time . We anticipate increase T regulatory specific cytokine , IL-10 TGF-beta , parallel early clinical response may indicate immune deviation toward tolerance . The conversion Th2 Th1 cytokine response would similar clinical effect make subject less sensitive tree nut , would likely occur alternative mechanism mechanism combine T regulatory activation T cell change . A change basophil activation would indicate subject would less sensitive specific tree nut , anticipate response would parallel find clinical desensitization may indicate clinical tolerance development . Overall , assess immune parameter time conjunction clinical level reactivity determine mechanism ( ) relevant effective walnut OIT . STUDY DESIGN This walnut OIT study randomize , blind , placebo control study base previous experience The Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) use OIT food allergic subject . CHOP enroll 6 subject ( 4 active treatment 2 placebo treatment arm ) . Non-CHOP site enroll 24 subject , make total 30 ( 20 active treatment 10 placebo treatment arm ) child adult walnut allergy second tree nut allergy . Subjects randomize 2:1 ratio either active treatment group ( final dose 1500 mg walnut protein , n=20 ) placebo group ( n=10 ) . Subjects undergo one-day desensitization protocol design enable subject tolerate 6 mg walnut protein placebo ( initial day escalation phase ) . After initial escalation day achieve least 1.5 mg 6 mg walnut protein placebo , dose build-up occur every two week dose 24 34 week . A maintenance dose give 4 week follow 5 gram protein OFC walnut 5 gram protein OFC second tree nut ( ~38 week ) , study unblinded . Placebo subject fail OFC cross active treatment escalate described 1500 mg target dose . All subject follow total 142 week active treatment follow OFC ( therapy ) walnut second tree nut end long-term maintenance therapy . Subjects reduction serum specific IgE &lt; 5kU/L walnut test tree nut 142 week eligible tolerance OFC .</detailed_description>
