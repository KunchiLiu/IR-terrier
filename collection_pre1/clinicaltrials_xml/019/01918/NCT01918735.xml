	<brief_title>A Study Safety Tolerability GWP42006 Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group dose escalation , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study single escalate multiple dos GWP42006 healthy volunteer . The study consist 5 single dose occasion , five day repeat dose period . Part 1 Single Dosing : Four parallel group 11 subject participate oral single dosing , dose escalation study phase . In group , subject randomly assign eight subject receive active three subject receive placebo . It plan Groups 1 2 , stagger 'sentinel ' dose design use , two sub-groups : - The first comprise one placebo one active subject . - In second , seven subject receive active two receive placebo review 24 h post-dose safety data first group . Sentinel subject dosing perform higher-dose group measurable plasma GWP42006 Group 1 2 . One group within single dose part ( Group 3/dose level 3 ) receive intravenous administration 5 mg GWP42006 allow assessment bioavailability . There minimum seven day dos . Up three group may add evaluation , e.g . assess additional dose level food effect . The need additional group base review safety , tolerability PK data safety advisory committee . Dose Escalation : The plan dose level 25 mg ( Group 1/dose level 1 ) , 75 mg ( Group 2/dose level 2 ) , 200 mg ( Group 3/dose level 3 ) 400 mg ( Group 4/dose level 4 ) , maximum dose 800 mg. Administration successive dose dependent safety , tolerability PK data previous dos . Part 2 Multiple Dosing : The dos dose regimen assess Part 2 select base upon safety , PK data Part 1 study . It plan one group 11 subject participate multiple dose phase , subject randomly assign eight subject receive active three receive match placebo . Each subject receive select dose GWP42006 placebo , twice three time daily total five day , final dose administer morning Day 5 . Up two group may add evaluation , e.g . assess different dose level different dosing frequency . As single dosing , decision include group take base safety , tolerability PK data . All group would add blinded information .</detailed_description>
