	<brief_title>Controlled Evaluation Computerized Anger-reduction Treatment Suicide Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Problematic anger often find among return military veteran , especially expose combat . Anger control problem associate difficulty reintegration . One study Iraq-Afghanistan combat veteran use VA medical service ( N = 754 ) find difficulty control anger commonly report problem experience since homecoming , occur among 57 % sample ( Sayer et al. , 2010 ) . Problematic anger hostility also link risk suicide ( Daniel et al. , 2009 ; Lehnert , Overholser , &amp; Spirito , 1994 ; Maiuro , O'Sullivan , Michael , &amp; Vitaliano , 1989 ) . From perspective interpersonal-psychological theory suicide ( Joiner , 2005 ) , individual problematic anger may increase risk suicide engage impulsive behavior ( e.g. , aggression , substance abuse ) intend manage anger . Such behavior may lead exposure painful provocative event , increase acquire capability engage suicidal behavior . Additionally , anger problem often lead social isolation , may contribute great perceived burdensomeness fail sense belonging , establish risk factor suicide ( Van Orden et al. , 2010 ) . Anger prone individual likely hold hostile attribution bias , reflect tendency interpret ambiguous action others reflect hostile intent ( Wilkowski &amp; Robinson , 2008 ) . Recently , researcher develop computerized interpretation bias modification ( IBM ) protocols intend efficiently reduce interpretive bias . These treatment show efficacy reduce anxiety depression ( Beard &amp; Amir , 2008 ; Holmes , Lang , &amp; Shah , 2009 ; Mathews et al. , 2007 ) . We conduct study use similar procedure focus hostile interpretation bias find program successfully reduce anger hostility . To evaluate efficacy IBM protocol develop reduce anger suicide risk , conduct three-arm randomized control trial internet . Military veteran non-veteran community participant report elevated trait anger ( N = 120 ) randomize one three condition : 1 ) IBM ; 2 ) progressive muscle relaxation ( PMR ) ; 3 ) healthy education video ( control ) . Each condition consist eight 15-minute treatment session . Participants complete two session per week four week administer assessment pre- post-treatment . IBM PMR condition also complete 3-month 6-month follow-up assessment . To ensure adequate test effect intervention suicide risk , oversample individual current suicidal ideation . We hypothesize : 1 ) IBM lead great reduction anger PMR control condition sample problematic anger ; 2 ) IBM lead great reduction suicidal ideation , perceive burdensomeness , thwart belongingness PMR control condition ; 3 ) efficacy IBM condition reduce suicidal ideation mediate reduction perceive burdensomeness thwarted belongingness ; 4 ) group difference IBM PMR maintain 3-month 6-month follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
