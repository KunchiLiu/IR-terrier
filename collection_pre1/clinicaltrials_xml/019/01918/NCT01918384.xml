	<brief_summary>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) inherit neuromuscular disorder due mutation gene encode critical muscle protein call dystrophin . Currently , effective treatment option disease . A pharmacological approach promote mRNA translation regardless presence premature stop codon nonsense mutation , call readthrough strategy , develop recently DMD nonsense mutation . NPC-14 candidate compound readthrough strategy , since effective readthrough activity demonstrate nonclinical study . This study phase II study design assess safety , tolerability , efficacy NPC-14 ambulant DMD patient nonsense mutation confirm whole genome analysis . These goal accomplish monitor adverse event physical examination , cardiac , pulmonary , auditory , balance , laboratory test safety endpoint , dystrophin expression muscle biopsy primary efficacy endpoint , muscle function ( NSAA , time test , muscle strength ( QMT , MMT ) , dairy activity lifecorder ) , biomarkers secondary efficacy endpoint . The study randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study 21 DMD patient . After screen , eligible patient allocate dynamically weekly NPC-14 placebo ( saline ) 2:1 ratio receive study drug 36 week .</brief_summary>

Aged least 4 year time give informed consent 5 . Male 6 . Able hospitalize study requirement 7 . Signed Informed consent parents/legal guardian and/or sign assent subject ( age assent determine IRB ) 1 . Prior exposure investigational medicine potential restore dystrophin functional protein ( readthrough , exon skipping , utrophin upregulation therapy etc . ) 2 . Known mutation nucleotide 1555 12S rRNA gene mitochondrial DNA , and/or personally family treat history eight cranial nerve disorder （hearing loss、vertigo、tinnitus etc.）as result aminoglycoside use 3 . Inability hear within range 0 25 dB pure tone audiometry , abnormality auditory brainstem response audiometry , and/or loss frequency distortion product oto acoustic emission screen 4 . Poor oral intake enable oral intake , and/or bad general status 5 . Known allergy NPC14 , aminoglycosides , and/or bacitracin 6 . Presence antidystrophin antibody baseline assessments 7 . CysC ≥1.2 mg/L and/or creatinine concentration &gt; 1.5 time upper limit age correct normal range 8 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) &lt; 40 % leave ventricular fractional shortening ( FS ) &lt; 25 % , and/or ≥480 msec QTc ( correct QT interval Fridericia 's method ) 9 .
