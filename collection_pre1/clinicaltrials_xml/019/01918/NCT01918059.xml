	<detailed_description>This project randomize , control trial investigate cosmetic appearance repair traumatic lid laceration three different approach skin closure : absorbable suture ( surgical gut suture ) , non-absorbable suture ( polypropylene suture ) , tissue adhesive ( octyl-2-cyanoacrylate ) . The population include patient present Memorial Hermann Hospital require repair traumatic lid laceration . The study include partial thickness , full-thickness , margin-involving laceration first standard layer tarsal marginal suture repair perform necessary , patient randomize superficial skin closure either polypropylene suture closure , surgical gut suture closure , tissue adhesive closure . Subjects follow outpatient set 1 week 1 month post-repair time standardize photographs take later assess use two standardized appearance assessment tool : Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) Hollander Wound Evaluation Score ( HWES ) .</detailed_description>
