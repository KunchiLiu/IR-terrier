	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety two up-dosing regimen . The safety PURETHAL Birch evaluate rush regimen ( maximum dose reach 3 injection 3 week ) compare conventional regimen ( maximum dose reach 6 injection 6 week ) . The primary endpoint sudy comparison proportion patient successfully reach maintenance dose two treatment regime . A similar previous study PURETHAL Grasses show rush up-dosing scheme safe conventional up-dosing regime . Therefore expect up-dosing PURETHAL Birch accord rush regimen safe use conventional regimen .</brief_summary>
