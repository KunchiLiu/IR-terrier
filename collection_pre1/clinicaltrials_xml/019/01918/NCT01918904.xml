	<brief_summary>Calcinosis cutis refers group disorder characterize calcium deposition skin ( 1 ) . The disorder classify accord etiology follow type : dystrophic , metastatic , iatrogenic , idiopathic ( 1,2 ) . Dystrophic calcification occur set varicosity , infection , tumor , connective tissue disorder ( 1 ) . The connective tissue disorder commonly associate calcinosis cutis systemic sclerosis dermatomyositis , although also report patient systemic lupus erythematosus , undifferentiated connective tissue disorder , mixed connective tissue disorder ( 2 ) . The pathophysiology calcinosis cutis well understood , broad range severity see , benign localize , small nodule large , severely debilitate lesion ( 2 ) . Although many therapy investigate treatment calcinosis cutis , include calcium channel blocker , colchicine , minocycline , intravenous immunoglobulin , bisphosphonates , result mixed best ( 2 ) . Surgical removal sometimes feasible case localize lesion , however , recurrence surgery common ( 2 ) . Recently , several author report case dramatic resolution dystrophic calcinosis cutis lesion topical sodium thiosulfate preparation ( 1,3,4 ) . Systemic sodium thiosulfate therapy commonly use treat calciphylaxis patient renal disorder adverse event ( 1 ) . A search literature date yield formal study aim determine whether topical sodium thiosulfate truly effective therapy calcinosis cutis . As result , patient often treated therapy unproven ineffective calcinosis cutis eventually lead significant pain disability . Research Question : Does treatment dystrophic calcinosis cutis topical sodium thiosulfate result diminution lesion associate pain ? Objective : The objective pilot study investigate whether topical sodium thiosulfate effective therapy calcinosis cutis . This study also determine feasibility protocol provide information help direct future full-scale trial .</brief_summary>
