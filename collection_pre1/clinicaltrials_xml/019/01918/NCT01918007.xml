	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) childhood disorder breathe sleep characterize intermittent upper airway obstruction . Snoring , labor breathing apnea report parent frequent symptoms.Obstructive SDB result many different abnormality include large adenoid tonsil obesity . Intermittent upper airway obstruction sleep accompany low oxygen high carbon dioxide blood arousal sleep . If obstructive SDB treat , complication may develop : ) enuresis ; ii ) delay somatic growth rate ; iii ) central nervous system morbidity ( e.g . hyperactivity learn difficulty ) ; iv ) elevate blood pressure . Overnight polysomnography ( PSG ) consider gold-standard method define severity obstructive SDB subgroup child snore treat . However , PSG labor-intensive , time-consuming expensive diagnostic method , available many community setting . Thus , urgent need develop easy-to-use low-cost diagnostic method use determine severity obstructive SDB define subgroup child snore large adenoid tonsil benefit adenotonsillectomy ( AT ) . Pulse oximetry widely available , non-invasive method allow continuous monitor oxygen transport hemoglobin . Episodes upper airway obstruction frequently accompany reduction hemoglobin oxygen transport ( oxygen desaturation hemoglobin ) .The hypothesis research project subgroups child snore adenotonsillar hypertrophy certain abnormality oxygenation detect nocturnal pulse oximetry benefit AT community set .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Time wait list undergo AT Department Otorhinolaryngology , Chania General Hospital `` St. George '' approximately 3 month . In present study , child recruit randomized Active Comparator ( AT group ) Control Group ( No AT group ) time initial clinic visit , fulfill Inclusion Criteria parent consent participation study . Children AT group undergo baseline study evaluation end 3-month waiting time thus immediately prior AT . They also undergo follow-up study evaluation 3 month postoperatively . Children Control group undergo baseline study evaluation time enter surgical wait list . They undergo follow-up study evaluation 3 month later , immediately prior AT .</detailed_description>
