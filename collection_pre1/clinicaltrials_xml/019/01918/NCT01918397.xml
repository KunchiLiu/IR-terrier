	<brief_summary>Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) affect nearly 600,000 person year around world . This type tuberculosis difficult treat , many patient die . Drugs fluoroquinolone class important treat MDR-TB , best dose one effective fluoroquinolones , levofloxacin , know . This application propose study determine best dose levofloxacin use treat MDR-TB . 120 patient receive usual treatment , plus levofloxacin one four dos . The study perform Peru South Africa , MDR-TB common .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MDR-TB grow threat international health . A recent report WHO estimate 440,000 new case MDR-TB occur 127 country 2008 , cause 150,000 death ; represent 55 % increase number case since 2000 . Current treatment regimens 58-67 % success rate , many 20 % fail respond treatment die tuberculosis ; die become chronic carrier spread MDR-TB others . Fluoroquinolones ( FQ ) essential part regimens treatment MDR-TB ; substantially good outcome consistently see patient MDR-TB treat FQ , new FQ ( levofloxacin , gatifloxacin moxifloxacin ) potent antituberculosis agent available MDR-TB treatment . However , gatifloxacin take market dysglycemic reaction moxifloxacin produce mark QT prolongation , increase risk fatal arrhythmia . In contrast , QT study levofloxacin find minimal prolongation dose 20mg/kg . Levofloxacin currently give TB dose 11-14 mg/kg/day well tolerated dos 20 mg/kg . Although efficacy levofloxacin increase exposure increase animal study TB human study gram-negative bacteria , efficacy high dos TB human study . Thus , determination efficacious well-tolerated dose levofloxacin important research priority . In Phase 2 study , determine levofloxacin dose exposure achieve great reduction mycobacterial burden acceptable tolerability study 120 adult smear- culture-positive pulmonary MDR-TB site Peru South Africa . Levofloxacin administer optimize background regimen ( OBR ) address follow Specific Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To determine levofloxacin AUC/MIC provide short time sputum culture conversion solid medium . Specific Aim 2 : To determine high levofloxacin AUC safe associate few 25 % patient discontinue reduce dose levofloxacin . Specific Aim 3 : To develop dose algorithm achieve levofloxacin AUC associate maximal efficacy acceptable safety/tolerability . This clinical trial increase ability cure MDR-TB prevent emergence resistance new TB drug class optimize dose improve effectiveness exist antimycobacterial agent , use novel versatile study design rapidly efficiently identifies advance critical area . Construction algorithm predict optimal levofloxacin dose allow effective use levofloxacin , particularly area limited resource , burden MDR-TB greatest .</detailed_description>
