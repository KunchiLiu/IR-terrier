	<brief_summary>Rationale : Approx . 80 % acute stroke patient suffer acute hemiparesis . Stroke patient reach full potential discharge hospital . It proven extra training opportunity lead improvement . To date , new training possibility , robotic technique rehabilitation , virtual reality train system tele-rehabilitation develop aid training stroke patient . Objective : To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy individualise , intensive 6-week technology-assisted training regime , feature robotics-based self-adapting arm training system ( I-TRAVLE ) virtual context , focus improvement arm function arm skill performance chronic stroke patient low moderate proximal ( shoulder/arm ) muscle strength . Study design : single arm prospective cohort study . Study population : 16 stroke patient chronic phase stroke , age &gt; =18 , diagnosed central paresis arm , low moderate proximal ( shoulder arm ) muscle strength . Intervention ( applicable ) : Haptic feedback I-TRAVLE robot either support challenge patient perform movement arm , thereby train motor control co-ordination affect arm . Also strength endurance arm muscle use may train . The I-TRAVLE base training last 6 week . Each week participant attend train session 3 day , train 2x 30 minute , interspaced least half hour avoid ( general ) fatigue overuse . Main study parameters/endpoints : Baseline measurement perform 3x prior start intervention , interspaced 1 week assess baseline stability fluctuation baseline value . In chronic stroke patient spontaneous improvement expect . Also measurements perform 0 week 12 week post train . Primary outcome measure : Wolf Motor Function Test , ABILHAND , Goal Attainment Scaling . Secondary outcome measure : motricity index , plate tapping task , active range motion , perceive strength fatigue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All test exercise pain free , easy perform , non-intrusive , high demanding . Subjects undergo assessment via movement protocol well clinical outcome test . In case type assessment differ normal assessment rehabilitation centre . The training assist use robotic device call Haptic Master ( HM ) . The participant 's arm attach HM via gimbal . The HM number safety feature avoid overload participant 's arm . Any potential risk overload minimise ) careful build-up training regime ; b ) regular check-ups ; c ) check participant 's status prior next training session .</detailed_description>
