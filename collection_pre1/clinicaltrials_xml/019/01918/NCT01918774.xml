	<detailed_description>Background Significance In 2010 , 11.5 % Gulf War-II Veterans unemployed ; figure rise 15.2 % January 2011 continue grow number Veterans recent war increase ( United States Department Labor , 2011 ; Seal et al. , 2009 ) . The prevalence mental illness among Veterans also notable ; estimate range 31 % ( Seal et al. , 2007 ) nearly 37 % ( Seal et al. , 2009 ) psychiatric disorder , half Veterans diagnose one psychiatric condition ( Seal et al. , 2007 ) . In addition , empirical evidence suggest mental disorder prevalent Veterans general population ( Kessler et al. , 2005 ) . Linking unemployment mental illness , recent study find 65 % Veterans use VA healthcare unemployed , compare employed Veterans , unemployed likely depression , bipolar disorder , post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , schizophrenia , substance use disorder . Vocational dysfunction report often disabled Veterans schizophrenia , PTSD , substance use disorder ( Zivin et al. , 2011 ) . Not surprisingly , study also find unemployed Veterans significantly low income employ person . Similarly , large study focus specifically Veterans PTSD conclude vocational dysfunction notable problem among group , significantly less likely employed participate VA work program compare participant without disorder ( Resnick &amp; Rosenheck , 2008 ) . Because individual mental illness desire work regular competitive employment ( McQuilken et al. , 2003 ) , nationwide problem unemployment among Veterans mental illness particularly trouble . The VA address need implement support employment ( SE ) , psychiatric rehabilitation approach provide individual vocational assistance Veterans mental illness . While SE model empirically validate SE program show achieve partial success improve employment outcome , sizable proportion individual , 40 % , remain unemployed ( Bond et al. , 2008 ) . A challenge job retention ; Veterans mental illness obtain job frequently struggle maintain long-term . Even context high quality , evidence-based vocational service , study show modest job retention month ( Bond et al. , 2008 ) , consequently , frequent job loss inconsistent vocational functioning remain substantial unsolved problem . In response problem , suggest intervention focus patient-level barrier augment exist vocational service . Rationale Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) effectively reduce symptom across range psychiatric condition ( Butler et al. , 2006 ; Wykes et al. , 2008 ) ; however , benefit function remain less well understood . Some study evidence positive influence CBT functional outcome , whereas others . One possible explanation inconsistency across study CBT intervention often focus symptom rather community functioning . The CBT intervention specifically design address function show promising result . One functional area critical importance work-a central goal Veterans ( without ) mental illness . However , work function receive little empirical attention CBT domain . Despite research evidence suggest maladaptive thought oneself expectation ability work interfere work success ( e.g. , Hoffman et al. , 2000 ) , CBT program develop specifically target vocational theme goal improve competitive work outcomes . Further , recent paper outline need avenue future study support employment domain ; Drake Bond ( 2011 ) state cognitive strategy may fruitful area develop help `` nonresponder '' consumer mental illness struggle vocational dysfunction despite high quality vocational assistance . The goal current project address gap serious problem unemployment Veterans mental illness test CBT program design enhance competitive work function population . Aim 1 : Test preliminary efficacy CBTw program key Veteran employment psychosocial outcome utilize pre/post design . Aim 2 : Further assess feasibility program , include recruitment , retention rate , program participation rate . Aim 3 : Gauge effect size preparation large randomize control trial examine effectiveness CBT program routine practice setting Research Design Methods This study pilot test cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) intervention person mental illness target improve competitive employment outcome , term `` CBT Work Success ( CBTw ) program '' ; CBT intervention serve compliment exist support employment service VA. Fifty participant take part 12 week group-based CBTw program . All participant receive standard SE service study . The longitudinal design consist assessment competitive employment outcome , important psychosocial outcome , background demographic variable baseline two follow-up periods-immediately follow conclusion CBTw program six month conclusion program . Measures Unless otherwise specify , study measure collect three time point : baseline , post intervention , 3 month follow . Background Characteristics . Collected baseline , participant background characteristic include sex , age , ethnicity , educational attainment , co-morbid medical condition , military era serve , branch military , marital status , residential status , current work status ( employed/unemployed ) , work history ( i.e. , week work six month precede study ; number job hold within six month precede study ; long consecutive period competitive employment past ) , entitlements receive , legal history ( i.e. , number felony conviction ) . The investigator collect data combination SE record , patient medical record ( i.e. , CPRS ) , participant self-report . Competitive Employment Outcomes . Competitive employment outcome assess two follow-up time point ( intervention 3 month follow-up ) participant self-report support employment record available . These outcome standard study employment person mental illness include employment status ( working/not work ) , total number job acquisition , total number job loss , total number week work follow-up period , job tenure define number week work long job hold follow-up period , total wage earn across study follow-up period . Job search behavior proximal step toward employment . Via participant self report CPRS chart review , proximal step toward employment also assess include preparation resume ( yes/no ) number application submit community job , number job interview community job , number job offer . These variable routinely examine study examine job search behavior employment outcome person mental illness ( e.g. , Corbiere et al. , 2011 ) . Work-related self-efficacy . Work related self-efficacy define one 's perceive ability confidence perform work activity . Given adapted CBT program seek improve perception , investigator measure construct use Work-Related Self-efficacy Scale ( Waghorn et al. , 2005 ) . The 37-item self-report scale yield total score measure four sub-domains self-efficacy : general work skill , career planning , job secure skill , work-related social skill . Studies suggest scale adequate good reliability validity adult mental illness living community ( Harris et al. , 2010 ) . Employment Commitment . The Employment Commitment Measure ( ECM ; Larson et al. , 2011 ) , develop person mental illness , assess attitude towards factor impact employment status . The 11-item ECM bifactorial , include incentive barrier work domain . Because CBT focus change maladaptive thought attitude , plausible intervention may positively impact perception incentives barrier work , lead favorable employment outcome . ECM item answer 1 7 Likert scale indicate degree one agree employment factor ( 1-highly disagree , 4-unsure , 7-highly agree ) ; e.g. , `` Having job reduce depression . '' Previous study find ECM strong criterion relate validity ( e.g. , Larson et al. , 2011 ) . Attitudes toward work . Attitudes toward work operationalized centrality work participant life . This one item measure ask participant rate 0 , `` work central life '' 10 , `` work center life . '' This measure design use person mental illness show strong criterion-related validity ( Corbiere et al. , 2011 ) . Motivation work : Motivation work measure Work Extrinsic Intrinsic Motivation Scale ( WEIMS ) base self determination theory ; 18-item WEIMS measure six empirically grounded domain motivation , include 1 ) . intrinsic motivation ( e.g. , `` I want work satisfaction I experience take interesting challenge '' ) ; 2 ) . integrate regulation motivation ( e.g. , I want work fundamental part I . `` ) ; 3 ) identify regulation motivation ( e.g. , `` I want work attain certain lifestyle '' ; 4 ) introject regulation ( e.g. , `` I want work I want winner life . `` ) ; 5 ) external regulation ( e.g. , I want work provide security . `` ) ; 6 ) amotivation ( e.g. , `` I n't know I want work. '' ) . The WEIMS score 1 7 Likert scale ( 'Does correspond ' 'Corresponds exactly ' ) high score indicate high level domain motivation . The WEIMS show strong predictive validity , correlate highly work behavior ( e.g. , Tremblay et al. , 2009 ) . Global motivation work measure one item : `` How motivated work ? '' measure 1 10 Likert scale , 1-'Not motivate ' ; 10-'Extremely motivate ' . Work effectiveness &amp; Work Productivity . The Work Health Interview ( Stewart et al. , 2003 ) ass work effectiveness work productivity participant currently work ( unemployed participant complete measure ) . Work effectiveness measure one self-report item- '' On day work past 4 week , effective job average ? Please tell , scale 0 100 , 0 % mean effective , 100 % mean completely effective , effective would say job past 4 week ? '' Work productivity measure 7 self-report item score Likert scale range 0 , `` none time '' 4 , `` time '' ( item example : `` Work slowly usual ? '' ) . Participants report work productivity last two week . The Work Health Interview use widely patient chronic condition , demonstrate good psychometric property . Engagement vocational service . Engagement SE service examine number session attend SE vocational rehabilitation specialist . Engagement assess three month prior baseline , intervention period , three month follow-up . Self-esteem : The Rosenberg self esteem scale ( RSES ) , 10-item Likert scale ( 1-strongly agree ; 2-agree ; 3-disagree ; 4-strongly disagree ) examine self esteem ( Rosenberg , 1965 ) ; high score RSES indicate high level unidimensional self-esteem construct . The RSES use extensively samples person without mental illness across various ethnic cultural group , demonstrate good reliability validity ( e.g . Link et al. , 2014 ) . Quality Life . Prior study mental health domain demonstrate quality life improve response CBT treatment , therefore , discuss regard symptom , quality life may enhance response CBT treatment , regardless impact work outcomes . The Quality Life Interview ( QOLI ; Lehman , 1988 ) , develop specifically psychiatric population , measure Veteran quality life . The investigator use 17 item assess subjective quality life , include global life satisfaction follow sub-domains : living situation , daily activity function , family relation , social relation , legal safety issue , health . The QOLI show good reliability validity adult outpatient ( Lehman , 1988 ; Lehman et al. , 1993 ) . Subjective Recovery : Global perceive recovery assessed Recovery Assessment Scale ( RAS ) ( Corrigan et al. , 1999 ) , 41 item scale design assess perception recovery hold person mental illness . Because perception recovery may amenable CBT associate key functional outcome , include employment , appropriate examine study . The self-report RAS score 1 5 Likert scale 'strongly disagree ' 'strongly agree ' ( e.g. , `` I desire succeed. '' ) . The RAS five factor include `` confidence hope , '' `` willingness ask help '' , `` goal success orientation '' , `` reliance others '' , `` domination symptom . '' Higher score indicate strong hold perception personal recovery . The RAS show good test retest reliability , internal consistency , criterion-related validity ( Corrigan et al. , 1999 ) . Symptoms . Symptoms essential ass study , often primary beneficiary CBT intervention , demonstrate moderate large effect size randomize trial across numerous psychiatric condition . Thus , possible symptom may improve response CBT treatment , regardless change employment status . Psychiatric symptom often present schizophrenia-spectrum disorder assess Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , use extensively study psychiatric rehabilitation CBT . The PANSS ( Kay et al. , 1987 ) comprise 30 item score 1 7 Likert scale , total score obtain add score 30 item ( total score range 30 240 ) . The PANSS five subscales identify via factor analytic study include Positive syndrome ( 6 item ) , Negative syndrome ( 8 item ) , Emotional discomfort ( 4 item ) , Hostility ( 4 item ) , Cognitive ( 7 item ) . The PANSS adequate reliability validity ( Kay et al. , 1987 ) . In addition , investigator assess depression anxiety , two commonly occur psychiatric condition Veterans ( Seal et al. , 2007 ) ; depression anxiety link vocational dysfunction demonstrate respond well CBT ( e.g. , Butler et al. , 2006 ) . Current level depression assess use Beck Depression Inventory , Second Edition ( Beck , Steer , &amp; Brown , 1996 ) . The BDI-II contain 21 item assess various mood bodily symptoms depression ; participant ask respond base symptom past two week . There four response option item reflect increase severity depression ; total score obtain sum score item ( 0-3 ) . The BDI-II gold standard tool assess depression non-clinical psychiatric population show excellent reliability validity across several prior study ( e.g. , Yin &amp; Fan , 2000 ) . Thirdly , symptom anxiety assess use Beck Anxiety Inventory ( Beck &amp; Steer , 1993 ) . The BAI 21 item , describe psychological physiological symptom anxiety ( e.g. , `` Nervous '' ) respondents rate 0 3 Likert Scale ( `` '' `` severely '' ) base much bother symptom within past week . The BAI widely use assess anxiety adult mental illness demonstrate strong psychometric property ( e.g. , Fydrich , Dowdall , &amp; Chambless , 1992 ) . Fourth , PTSD symptom assess use PTSD CheckList ( PCL ) . The PCL contain 17 self-report item , respondent ask indicate degree particular symptom ( e.g. , `` flashback '' ) bother past month . Items answer 1 5 Likert scale ( `` '' `` extremely '' ) . Used extensively Veterans , PCL demonstrate strong psychometric property ( Blanchard , Jones-Alexander , Buckley , &amp; Forneris , 1996 ) . Current substance use assess baseline ; consideration investigator ' previous work demonstrate link active substance use difficulty obtain work Veteran mental illness receive SE service ( Kukla , McGuire , &amp; Salyers , 2015 ) . In addition , substance abuse may hinder participant benefit CBTw intervention . The investigator use recent substance use section Addiction Severity Index ( ASI ; McClellan , Luborsky , &amp; Woody , 1980 ) , assess use variety substance previous 30 day . Acceptability CBTw : Veteran Satisfaction . Veteran satisfaction CBTw program measure use Satisfaction Services Scale ( SWS ) ( Attkisson &amp; Zwick , 1982 ) post-intervention assessment ( follow conclusion 12-week CBTw program ) . The SWS 11-item questionnaire derive Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ( Larsen et al. , 1979 ) . The SWS use prior large study psychiatric rehabilitation ( e.g. , Salyers et al. , 2009 ) show good internal consistency criterion relate validity ( Attkisson &amp; Zwick , 1982 ) . Feasibility Assessment : Feasibility CBTw program assess evaluate follow recruitment , retention , participation outcome CBTw pilot follow-up period : ( 1 ) number participant enrol study , ( 2 ) number attend weekly CBT group session , ( 3 ) number participant attend least 50 % group session , indicate adequate `` exposure '' program , ( 4 ) mean number session attend ; ( 5 ) number participant complete post-treatment follow-up assessment , ( 6 ) number participant complete 3-month follow-up assessment ; 7 ) number participant dropout CBTw program . Fidelity cognitive behavioral therapy : Adherence CBT model assess adapted form Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale ( CTS-R ; Milne et al. , 2001 ) . The group therapy version comprise seven item rat 0-6 likert scale , rating `` 3 '' great item indicate fully-competent practice compare average skilled clinician . Prior study use group therapy version CTS-R find good excellent interrater reliability ( Lysaker et al. , 2009 ) . Furthermore , fidelity assess use audio recording three random session per CBTw group conduct blinded member study team train CBT fidelity Dr. Kukla . Analysis Data analyze use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) , version 20 . First , frequency distribution histograms generate determine normality sample distribution inspect outlier . If distribution skew , data transformation use nonparametric test primary analysis consider . Secondly , descriptive statistic generate characterize demographic background composition sample level outcome variable baseline , post-treatment , three month post-treatment . This mean standard deviation information obtain used sample size calculation future expand randomized trial . Next , study outcome compare baseline two follow time point use series dependent group T-tests . Significance value t-tests set p &lt; .025 account effect inflate alpha due multiple comparison . Next , mixed effect regression model conduct include random effect account nested nature data , ( i.e . three measurement point nest within participant ) . These model identify trajectory change outcomes time allow inclusion important covariates ( e.g. , employment history assessed baseline ) . P value set .05 . Clinical Significance Information study help guide activity future plan study . Specifically , lead future large VA merit study test intervention use randomize controlled design scalable routine service setting .</detailed_description>
