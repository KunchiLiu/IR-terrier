	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate effect target preoperative Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) detection polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) either endogenous exogenous postoperative MRSA infection high risk population undergo gastroenterological surgery . The primary endpoint investigate whether potentially high incidence MRSA infection patient MRSA nasal colonization surgery prevent PCR-based strategy . The second endpoint investigate impact acquisition MRSA colonization surgery occurrence MRSA infection . Investigators hypothesize postoperative MRSA infection prevent targeted screening strategy preoperative MRSA carrier , limited effect patient postoperative MRSA acquisition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Methicillin-resistant S.Aureus ( MRSA ) Infections MRSA Carrier Under Introduction Rapid MRSA Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Target screen nasal carriage MRSA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform admission . In order identify MRSA nasal acquisition ward , patient negative surgery re-screened every 7 day discharge . The inclusion criterion screen patient undergo inflammatory bowel disease surgery ward A , undergo major hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery ward B . Investigators classify enrolled patient preoperative MRSA nasal carriage , postoperative nasal acquisition patient negative PCR assay surgery , non-nasal MRSA carriage hospitalization . Development postoperative infection cause MRSA assess accord nasal MRSA carriage status . MRSA infection rate also compare 2-years intervention period previous 2-year control period ward . Control measure identify MRSA carrier consist contact precaution , antibiotic prophylaxis single dose vancomycin 1g addition cephalosporin , topical decolonization MRSA ( application 2 % mupirocin ointment twice daily naris 5 day bath 4 % chlorhexidine daily 3-5 day ) . Although contact precaution use care MRSA-colonized patient , isolation/cohorting routinely practice .</detailed_description>
