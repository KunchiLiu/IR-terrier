Objective : The aim study , randomize control trial ( RCT ) , validate TEAMS treatment program clinical setting Denmark .

	<detailed_description>Based calculation strength : Concurring statistically significant outcome estimate cohort minimum 87 child . Based Region Zealand 's visitation history record cohort expect approximately 100-160 child . Group size : The number participant treatment group depend part many child recruit . Given constraint set , treatment group generally consist least two , five participant . Staffing : Two group leader one student-assistant present every five participant playgroup . For primary efficiency measurement project use : ADHD-RS-IV ( Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale fourth edition ) , scale evaluate severity ADHD symptom , SDQ-DAN ( Strengths Difficulties Questionnaire - Danish translation ) focus upon child 's strengths weakness accordance activity attention , emotional problem , behavioural difficulty etc . For secondary efficiency measurement project use : TCA ( Treatment Compliance Assessment ) ( Halperin et al : press ) , establishes much time child spends TEAMS activity television/computer game day . Each day parent fill TCA , part logbook also describe compliance TEAMS treatment project . The questionnaire continuously catalogue database facility ( SurveyXact ) . The TCA instrument complete weekly 8 week TEAMS program .</detailed_description>
