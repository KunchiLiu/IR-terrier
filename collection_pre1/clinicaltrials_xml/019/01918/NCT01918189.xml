	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The primary objective propose study : ( 1 ) develop integrative , Internet-based , Veteran-centered behavioral intervention , Pain EASE program chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) , ( 2 ) examine preliminary efficacy , usability , satisfaction intervention representative sample Veterans CLBP . The primary hypothesis state clinically meaningful reduction pain-related functional interference observe follow ten week exposure Pain EASE program relative baseline . The secondary hypothesis state clinically meaningful reduction rating average pain intensity 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain imaginable ) numeric rating scale ten week post-baseline follow-up assessment interval observe , addition statistically significant reduction fatigue , sleep problem , depressive symptom , negative mood ten week post-baseline assessment . The tertiary hypothesis state participant report high level interest , site usage , satisfaction . RESEARCH DESIGN : A non-randomized pilot study two phase propose develop evaluate internet-based behavioral pain self-management program . Phase I solely involve qualitative data collection . Repeated quantitative assessment Phase II conduct baseline 10-weeks post-baseline . METHODOLOGY : A 24-month pilot study two phase propose . During Phase I , Pain EASE program develop feedback 15 Veterans CLBP Expert Panel pain management clinician use modify program . During Phase II , pilot feasibility trial Pain EASE program 55 Veterans CLBP conduct . Subjects total 70 patient receive care VA Connecticut Healthcare System ( VACHS ) report chronic low back pain . The primary criterion inclusion constant pain least three month duration least moderate level average pain ( i.e. , score 4 great 0 [ pain ] 10 [ bad pain imaginable ] ) numerical rating scale pain indication `` preparation '' , `` action '' , `` maintenance '' stage readiness change brief five item stag checklist . All patient must access computer internet connection . Excluded patient life threaten acute physical illness , current alcohol substance abuse dependence , current psychosis , suicidal ideation , dementia , individual seek surgical pain treatment . All participant continue receive usual care Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) provider . During 10-week therapeutic window , weekly telephone call research staff serve cue monitor participant ' use Internet program . At ten week post-baseline , participant formally reassess .
