	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose stereotactic body radiation therapy give together capecitabine surgery treat patient pancreatic cancer remove surgery . Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy capecitabine surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended-phase-II-dose ( RPTD ) stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) escalate dose schedule combine standard-dose capecitabine neoadjuvant therapy resectable carcinoma exocrine pancreas . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate incidence overall 30-day post-operative complication . II . To estimate radiological response rate . III . To estimate pathological response rate . IV . To estimate rate resection negative margin . V. To estimate recurrence free survival ( RFS ) . VI . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES ( OPTIONAL ) : I . To define tumor volume ( TV ) , dynamic contrast enhancement ( DCE ) pattern mean apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) measurements diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging ( DWI ) patient resectable pancreatic cancer undergo neoadjuvant SBRT concomitant chemotherapy ( ChT ) . II . To correlate TV , DCE ADC measurement baseline magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) versus final pathological response . III . To correlate TV , DCE ADC change baseline MRI do three week post-SBRT versus final pathological response . IV . To predict surgical margin status use MRI do baseline three week post-SBRT . V. To correlate TV , DCE ADC change baseline MRI do post-3rd fraction baseline versus final pathological response . VI . To describe biopsy and/ surgical specimen , expression follow marker : secrete protein acidic rich cysteine ( SPARC ) expression ; distribution pancreatic stellate cell ( PSC ) ; distribution cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+/ CD8+ T cell , CD56+ natural killer ( NK ) cell ; molecular inflammatory cellular marker may explore . VII . To describe change induce neoadjuvant therapy comparison expression marker biopsy surgical specimen . VIII . To compare baseline and/ post-treatment expression treatment response , toxicity clinical survival outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study SBRT . Patients undergo SBRT every day 2 week total 5 fraction receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) every 12 hour 5 day week 2 week . Patients undergo definitive surgery minimum 2 week completion SBRT . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month 3 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
