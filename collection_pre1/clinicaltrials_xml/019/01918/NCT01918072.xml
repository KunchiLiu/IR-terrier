	<brief_summary>VA community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOCs ) typically serve small number woman Veterans , generally woman 's health care resource available large setting . Women Veterans use site primary care must sometimes travel site receive woman 's health care . That create travel burden , reduce continuity care , negatively affect patient outcomes . To address , VA implement clinical operation innovation support woman 's primary care provider technology-based intervention combine interactive communication woman 's health specialist ongoing education . This research study evaluate implementation effect woman 's healthcare delivery innovation . Findings research inform VA woman 's health clinical practice education , advance science deliver technology-supported non-face-to-face care applicable clinical condition patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project Background/Rationale : Women Veterans rapidly grow proportion VA patient . While entitle receive care equivalent male counterpart , woman Veterans may receive low quality care , part due VA primary care ( PC ) workforce limit experience care woman , particularly gender-specific condition . This workforce may especially challenge community-based outpatient clinic ( CBOCs ) , access woman 's health ( WH ) expertise may readily available . CBOC PC provider ( PCPs ) typically small caseloads woman Veterans , make difficult provider maintain WH knowledge skill . To ensure quality care woman Veterans , VA mandate designate WH provider ( DWHPs ) every VA facility , institute intensive training opportunities- '' WH mini-residencies '' -for provider . Although highly valuable deliver standard level specialize WH training , one-time training sufficient , knowledge attenuates time . Serial education re-enforcement time need produce maintain long-term gain knowledge . Furthermore , additional support , enhance communication PCPs specialist , necessary achieve sustain quality gain . To address issue , VA implement clinical operation innovation design improve CBOC-based DWHP delivery comprehensive WH care . This innovation ( entitle DWHP Support ) combine : 1 ) advance WH serial patient-based education expose DWHPs , time , depth breadth WH case issue ( SCAN-ECHO ) ; 2 ) interactive communication CBOC DWHPs VA Medical Center-based specialist `` time '' support DWHP WH care ( electronic consultation ) . The intervention technology-supported deliver virtually . It implement stepwise manner . Objectives : Facilitators barrier use DWHP Support , effect patient management unknown . The investigator hypothesize DWHP Support improve quality efficiency WH care CBOCs . The specific aim : Aim # 1 : To evaluate effect DWHP Support WH care quality efficiency , use modify stepped wedge design ; Aim # 2 : To explore impact DWHP Support change DWHP behavior self-rated WH knowledge , skill , self-efficacy ; Aim # 3 : To assess attitude DWHP Support use , specialist time implementation , feature could influence DWHP Support 's effectiveness , sustainability spread ; Aim # 4 : To develop tool measure quality WH care VA. Methods : The investigator conduct observational study DWHP Support CBOC DWHPs . The investigator use mixed method analytic approach ( combine modify stepped wedge quantitative analysis provider survey interview ) measure intervention 's effect 1 year , also evaluate implementation process use intervention . The investigator use quality assessment method translate exist evidence-based WH performance guideline quality measurement tool applicable VA WH care . Anticipated Impact : This proposal aim evaluate innovation improve WH care CBOCs use technology-based educational interactive communication intervention design WH provider . To measure intervention 's effectiveness , project develop WH quality measure valuable tool VA effort improve WH care . The finding effectiveness implementation could influence VA 's approach use technology-supported intervention clinical condition special population .</detailed_description>
