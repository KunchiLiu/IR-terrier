	<brief_summary>Contact lens induced dry eye lead lens intolerance discontinuation . Incidence dry eye contact lens wearer significantly high Asian population compare ethnic group consider Asian low tear break time . Disruptions tear integrity contact lens wearer exacerbate condition . Factors successful contact lens fit derive biocompatibility lens material , lens design stability tear film front contact lens .

	<brief_title>Effect Contact Lens With Alginic Acid Dry Eye Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct compliance protocol , SGCP applicable regulatory requirement . Dry eye condition affect 5-35 % population.1 Common symptom condition include eye irritation , heaviness eyelid , visual disturbance , tear light sensitivity.2 This significantly impact quality life vision dry eye patient . In addition , significant socio-economic burden . In 2009 , 54,051 patient sought treatment dry eye Singapore National Eye Centre ( SNEC ) . In total , cost dry eye medication amount $ 181,354.17.15 Additionally , dry eye affect work productivity add socio-economic burden.16 Contact lens-induced dry eye ( CLIDE ) mimic symptom find dry eye patient . It report contact lens wearer 12 time likely report symptom emmetropes 5 time likely report symptom spectacle wearer . Lipid layer tear film break time decrease contact lens wear report , lead excessive evaporation , reduce tear volume increase osmolality . Asian contact lens wearer experience severe dry eye symptom compare non wearer ( Lungrin et al , ARVO 2008 ) . Reports show Asian shorter average tear break time ( TBUT ) low tear volume . Symptom usually increase significantly course day ( Begley coworkers ( 2000 ) ) . Contact lens material tear film stability remain important association patient dryness symptom . Lens hydration link comfort wearer perturbation tear mechanism contact lens wearer decrease stability tear film thus decrease comfort level . Evaporation tear film find increase lens wear . To date , silicone hydrogel lenses surface technology mimic ocular surface find encouraging among wearer . A novel type disposable contact lens develop Japan ( SEED 1dayPure moisture 2 week pure ) . It corporate factor high water content , zwitterionic material contain alginic acid act moisturize agent , high biocompatibility positive negative ion prevents contamination , UV protection shape stability suitable patient suffer contact lens induce dry eye . Contact lens induced dry eye remain one major factor contact lens drop . Advanced lens material replacement schedule may contribute largely acceptance contact lens population . With introduction novel disposable contact lens material , may significantly improve dry eye comfort symptomatic wearer . Practitioners may achieve successful fitting outcome . Recent technological advance , well infrastructure Singapore Eye Research Institute ( proximity Singapore National Eye Center pre-existing facility infrastructure clinical trial ) facilitate study product avaliable elsewhere may benefit Singaporean population . Contact lens induced dry eye lead reduce wear time ultimately cease lens wear . Tear stability reduce symptomatic contact lens wearer evaporation show increase lens wear . A novel type contact lens ability retain moisture eye would desirable management contact lens induced dry eye ( CLIDE ) , increase comfort reduce contact lens dropout . Methods Participants target sample size Thirty symptomatic habitual contact lens wearer recruit study dry eye clinic SNEC . Recruited patient randomly assign one 2 treatment arm . Treatment arm : Control : Same lens without alginic acid ( n=15 ) Zwitterionic alginic acid ; SEED 1 dayPure Moisture ( n=15 ) Patients ask lay habitual contact lenses 2 day prior baseline visit . Wearing schedule daily wear daily replacement . Patients advise wear contact lens every day study period 7 day minimum 8 hour per day . They also instruct sleep contact lens . Visit schedule There total 3 study visit , include screen visit perform regular dry eye clinic . If eligible , patient schedule baseline visit . Subsequent follow visit 7th day 8th day . A window period +/- 2 day permit study . Duration study : Seven day . Primary Outcome • Difference Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) ocular discomfort control treatment group . A VAS applied evaluate dry eye symptom describe Schaumberg et al . ( Schaumberg , Gulati et al . 2007 ) . The score record separately frequency severity dry eye symptom . The patient ask check point 100-mm line corresponds degree symptom . The location mark make patient question measure mm leave hand side 100 mm line record mm . For follow visit , measure distance mark make patient central anchor , negative value record leave anchor positive value right anchor . A global score calculate multiplying frequency score severity score take square root result ( transform back original scale ) . Secondary Outcomes - Tear lipid layer thickness measurement LipiView - Schirmers I read - Tear break time ( TBUT ) - Corneal flourescein stain - Tear proteomic analysis Inclusion Criteria 1 .
