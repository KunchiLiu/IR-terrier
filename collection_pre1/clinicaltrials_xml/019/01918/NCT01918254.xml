	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label dose-escalation study extension phase evaluate safety pharmacokinetics RO5479599 combination pertuzumab paclitaxel participant metastatic breast cancer express HER3 HER2 protein . Cohorts participant receive escalate dos RO5479599 intravenously ( IV ) every three week ( Q3W ) combination pertuzumab 840 milligram ( mg ) IV initial dose follow 420 mg IV Q3W paclitaxel 80 milligram per square meter ( mg/m^2 ) IV weekly . After completion dose-limiting toxicity period ( 21 day ) , study conduct two extension phase cohort : Cohort 1 Cohort 2 . Enrollment Extension Phase Cohort 2 occur upon completion Extension Phase Cohort 1 . Anticipated time study treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur .</brief_summary>
