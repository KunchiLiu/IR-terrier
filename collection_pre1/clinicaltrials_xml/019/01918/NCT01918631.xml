	<brief_title>A Randomized Controlled Trial Efficacy Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate ( TDF ) -Switch Therapy Chronic Hepatitis B Patients With Incomplete Response Entecavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection affect approximately 400 million people worldwide , three-quarter Asia-Pacific region [ 1-3 ] . Nucleos ( ) ide analogs treatment suppress viral replication , delay cirrhotic complication reduce risk hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) [ 4-5 ] . Currently , five nucleos ( ) ide analogs approved treatment chronic hepatitis B , namely lamivudine , adefovir dipivoxil , telbivudine , entecavir ( ETV ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . ETV TDF recommend first-line therapy regional guideline due high anti-viral potency low risk induce resistance [ 6-8 ] . ETV monotherapy chronic HBV infection highly effective HBeAg-positive negative treatment-naïve patient [ 9-10 ] . The cumulative probability maintain virologic suppression undetectable HBV DNA year 1 , 2 3 76.5 % , 83.0 % 88.3 % respectively [ 11 ] . TDF another potent anti-viral treatment chronic hepatitis B . Up 72 % 87 % HBeAg-positive -negative patient achieve undetectable HBV DNA week 144 TDF monotherapy [ 12 ] . It also effective patient prior exposure nucleo ( ) tide analog . Previous study demonstrate TDF use effective rescue therapy lamivudine adefovir-treated patient incomplete virologic response [ 13-14 ] . The importance complete viral suppression emphasize . In treatment-naïve patient , positive correlation HBV DNA level risk develop cirrhosis HCC [ 15-17 ] . In recent report 372 ETV-treated patient , suppression HBV DNA less 2000 IU/ml associate low risk disease progression among cirrhosis baseline [ 18 ] . Therefore , suppress HBV DNA undetectable level treatment target , especially patient establish cirrhosis great risk HCC .</detailed_description>
