	<detailed_description>End stage renal disease ( ESRD ) kidney disease require dialysis kidney transplant replace lose kidney function . The common renal replacement therapy North America conventional , in-center hemodialysis ( CHD ) . Home dialysis - include peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) home hemodialysis ( HHD ) offer benefit quality life , patient satisfaction clinical advantage , include good survival compare CHD . ( reference 1-11 protocol ) . Patients ( ESRD ) high burden co-morbidity . Periods transition care acute care setting think represent time increase vulnerability . Since patient require home dialysis high co-morbidity complex medical care issue , investigator seek improve transition care patient novel strategy follow-up . When patient hospitalize , treatment infection , procedure , transition home dialysis therapy , investigator aim decrease gap care clinician follow-up telephone patient schedule way . During telephone call clinician ass patient care symptom , make adjustment prescription medication dialysis , referral additional care require . Evaluation care include : 1 . Indication admission Virtual Ward . 2 . Dialysis prescription . 3 . Demographic comorbidity data . 4 . Medication reconciliation . 5 . Symptom Assessment . 6 . Dietary review . Symptoms evaluate use standardized patient assessment tool , Charlson Comorbidity Index modify Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale . At end Virtual Ward follow-up period , patient ask complete Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire . Data preliminary vanguard pilot phase 84 assessment do 21 patient 2 month indicate 170 200 patient recruit eight site 10 month period sufficient allow analysis data collect .
