	<brief_summary>Phenolic acid naturally-occurring constituent plant-derived food beverage characterise phenol ring structure . The phenolic compound go focus study Chlorogenic acid ( CGAs ) , family ester conjugate formed Hydroxycinnamic acid quinic acid ( 1 ) show strong antioxidant activity ( 2 ) . HCAs represent 50 % total polyphenolic coumpounds intake typical UK diet ( 3 ) people drink , coffee a/the major dietary source of/for HCAs ( 4 ) . A study suggest protective effect cardiovascular disease ( 5 ) , neurodegenerative disease , type 2 diabetis liver kidney cancer risk . However , many data field obtain vitro and/or animal , difficult dangerous extrapolate risk human development progression particular health condition , human study therefore need . We aim compare people metabolise best CGAs coffee metabolise least well . This achieve measure metabolite urine . The effect CGAs human body depend amount ingest , also quality metabolism , therefore also want determine mechanism responsible inter-individual variation order identify link health biomarkers , include non-cellular inflammation cardiovascular risk indicator . For cohort study fund University Leeds , approximately 60 healthy volunteer recruit School Food Science &amp; Nutrition . If meet selection criterion , participant ask undergo 36-hour wash-out period . During 36 hour , participant wo n't allow drink coffee , ask follow diet low phenolic acid keep record meal . On first day study , single dose coffee rich antioxidant give participant urine collect time 36 hour coffee consumption . Participants follow 5 6 week .</brief_summary>
