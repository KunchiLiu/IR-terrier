	<brief_summary>In study , investigator test effectiveness combination eribulin , pertuzumab trastuzumab learn whether combination drug work treat advanced HER2-positive breast cancer receive least one prior treatment previously . At point , standard treatment HER2-positive cancer progress ( grow ) first treatment chemotherapy combine therapy target HER2 protein ( e.g. , trastuzumab lapatinib ) . All medication test study approve Food Drug administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic breast cancer . However , combination three medication participant yet test . Eribulin chemotherapy agent approve treatment metastatic breast cancer woman previously receive least two prior chemotherapeutic regimen treatment metastatic disease . Pertuzumab trastuzumab also approve treatment advance HER2-positive breast cancer . Both agent help treat breast cancer bind HER2 receptor . However , pertuzumab trastuzumab bind different part HER2 receptor . The goal research study find add pertuzumab , trastuzumab eribulin effective treat woman metastatic , HER2-positive breast cancer . The Investigators , also gather information side effect treatments The investigator also plan gather genetic information participant ' tumor ( collected biopsy ) . Cancers occur molecule control normal cell growth ( gene protein ) alter . Changes tumor gene gene normal cell call `` alteration . '' Many alteration detect directly examine cancer cell tumor circulate blood . Several alteration occur repeatedly certain type cancer already identify . These discovery lead development new drug `` target '' alteration . More remain discover . Some alteration find gene . Genes compose DNA `` letter , '' contain instruction tell cell body grow work . Genes make protein actually carry instruction cell . The investigator would like use DNA look alteration gene cancer cell blood cell use technology call `` sequencing . '' Gene sequence way read DNA identify error gene may contribute behavior cell . Some change gene occur cancer cell . Others occur normal cell well , gene may pass parent child . This research study examine kind gene . One scientific goal research study perform gene sequencing ( gene test ) cancer cell ( obtain biopsy surgery ) normal tissue ( usually blood ) . The result gene test use try develop good way treat prevent cancer . As part work , may also learn thing gene normal cell . However , interpretation test require study , investigator disclose result participant participate component study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Eribulin Mesylate , Trastuzumab , Pertuzumab Women With Metastatic , Unresectable Locally Advanced , Locally Recurrent HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each study treatment cycle last 21 day ( 3 week ) . The patient receive eribulin first day ( day 1 ) 8th day ( day 8 ) cycle . The patient also receive trastuzumab pertuzumab day 1 . All drug give intravenously . The dose pertuzumab trastuzumab patient study , standard approve dose medication . In first portion study , investigator examine dose eribulin safe give combination pertuzumab trastuzumab . For first 6 participant enrol onto study , investigator look see standard dose eribulin administer safely standard dos pertuzumab trastuzumab . If dose eribulin tolerate well , investigator test three-medication combination lower dose eribulin . The high dose find safe use next participant . The dose patient receive depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . At start cycle patient : - A medical history , include question health , current medication , allergy . - Performance status , evaluate patient able carry usual activity . - Physical examination - Blood test draw test monitor body 's function . - An assessment patient 's tumor use exams doctor 's choice , either CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) . In addition , patient may also receive bone scan PET scan . Assessments patient 's tumor perform every 2 cycle first 6 cycle . From , test occur every 3 cycle tumor progression . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , show electrical activity heart . It perform Day 1 cycle 2 . - Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) ( ultrasound heart ) MUGA scan ( test heart function use small amount radioactive substance ) . This performed every 3-4 month . Additional research procedure perform : - Archival Tumor Tissue Sample : A sample patient 's tumor tissue ( past surgery and/or biopsy ) collect use learn development metastatic breast cancer . - Blood test research ( include 5-6 tablespoon ) get level substance may help indicate response breast cancer study treatment . This perform participant enrol determination safe dose eribulin . It plan baseline . - Tumor biopsy research purpose . The purpose part study perform gene sequence ( gene test ) participant 's cancer cell . The investigator request permission obtain sample one area : breast , skin , chest , lymph node , soft tissue , bone , liver research purpose . The chosen area one treating provider considers appropriate . Alternatively ask patient use fluid thoracentesis paracentesis . If patient biopsy/thoracentesis paracentesis clinical care , tissue remove sample research . If biopsy biopsy need clinical care perform research purpose . This perform participant enrol determination safe dose eribulin . It plan baseline . The biopsy tumor progression optional . One main reason study genetic characteristic cancer learn whether predict response exist treatment . Therefore , study , investigator would also link result gene test patient 's cancer medical information generate course patient 's study treatment . The medical information require part study gather patient 's medical record . Some patient specimen , well material generate analysis patient 's tissue blood , may useful study future , new technology approach . The investigator ask patient 's permission store specimens material secure biological sample storage facility possible later research . Finally , rapid progress understand treat cancer occur genetic information derive patient 's tissue blood share researcher . In particular , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) organization develop special data ( information ) repositories analyze data collect result certain type genetic study . These central bank store patient 's genetic information , sample , survey/interview information provide qualified researcher study . Therefore , Investigators also ask patient 's permission share result special bank . After final dose study drug : The patient follow-up visit one month come study treatment every 9 week . During visit , patient physical examination , functional assessment , assessment side effect current medication . If patient continue ongoing side effect relate study treatment , investigator continue follow patient side effect resolve . If patient withdraws study another reason tumor progression , patient continue follow tumor progression . In addition , investigator collect 5-6 additional tablespoon blood research measure marker particular breast cancer exist . The patient also ask perform another tumor biopsy research purpose . The investigator would like keep track patient 's medical condition rest life . The investigator would like call patient telephone year see . Keeping touch patient check condition every year help investigator look long-term effect research study . This optional procedure .</detailed_description>
