	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot phase I trial evaluate quercetin enhances uptake green tea polyphenols prostate tissue men take green tea extract undergo radical prostatectomy . Side effect green tea extract quercetin combination green tea extract also evaluate . In preclinical study , green tea polyphenols anticancer cancer preventative effect number malignancy . Likewise , preclinical study quercetin find enhance anticancer effect green tea . This trial design translate finding forward short-term human intervention trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Quercetin Green Tea Polyphenol Uptake Prostate Tissue From Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate prostate tissue concentration epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , epicatechin gallate ( ECG ) quercetin methylated metabolite men schedule prostatectomy consume green tea ( GT ) extract ( N=15 ) GTextract quercetin ( N=15 ) 3 week prior prostatectomy . II . To determine concentration EGCG , ECG , epigallocatechin ( EGC ) , epicatechin ( EC ) quercetin methylated metabolite plasma collect ( T=0 ) two hour ( T=2 ) intake morning dose GTextract placebo GTextract quercetin third week intervention . III . To determine effect GTextract/quercetin intervention reduce enzyme activity protein gene expression catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) deoxyribonucleic ( DNA ) ( cytosine-5 ) methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) well protein gene expression multidrug resistance transport protein 1 ( MRP1 ) prostate tissue collect specific aim 1 COMT activity erythrocytes blood collect baseline week 3 . IV . To determine inter-individual variation genotype COMT buffy coat DNA . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive GT extract orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) quercetin PO BID 3-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM II : Patients receive GT extract PO BID placebo PO BID 3-6 week undergo prostatectomy .</detailed_description>
