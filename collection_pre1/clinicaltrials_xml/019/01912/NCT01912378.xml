	<brief_summary>The study investigate effect intranasal administration oxytocin ( OT ) parent child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) quality mother-father-child interaction . Physiological behavioral measure parent-child triadic interaction quality assess . H1 : Parents receive OT demonstrate great parental engagement nonverbal prosocial behavior compare parent receive placebo . H2 : Children ASD whose parent receive OT increase nonverbal prosocial behavior discussion play task compare child whose parent ' receive placebo . H3 : Parents receive OT demonstrate increase behavioral physiological synchrony child discussion play task compare parent receive placebo child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) continuum neurodevelopmental disorder associate significant communication , social , behavioral deficit include impairment verbal nonverbal communication excessive attachment routine . These deficit impede parent-child bonding , increase parental stress , lead dysfunctional parent-child interaction . While progress understand neurobiology neuropsychology schizophrenia autism spectrum disorder , treatment option remain inadequate . Psychosocial intervention family therapy aim promote affection , praise , communication reduce oppositional behavior , time consume costly . A safe cost-effective pharmacological intervention give non-affected family member could augment current psychosocial therapy , improve function family , favorably influence course illness affect child . Oxytocin ( OT ) neuropeptide associate parent social perception mammal . Exogenous OT safely administer intranasally human , enters brain high concentration , increase positive interpersonal parenting interaction , promote cooperation trust , reduce stress-induced physiological response . Due OT 's involvement process associate parent-child interaction ( e.g . bonding ) , hypothesize OT system represent highly promising focus research biological underpinnings family functioning , well promise target biological intervention aim improve communication parent child ASD reduce unhealthy interaction . We test hypothesis explore effect exogenously administer OT caregiver parent-child interaction physiology laboratory-based parent-child interaction task . If successful , would represent first demonstration neurobiological factor family function person ASD , would represent first biological intervention apply family member person ASD , rather individual ASD . The purpose current study twofold : 2 ) To determine whether administration affiliative neuropeptide oxytocin parent positively influence parent-child interaction patient autism spectrum disorder , 2 ) explore mechanism parental behavior affect child 's behavior , feeling , physiology . Participants 40 triad consist mother , father , child ASD 40 triad mother , father , typically develop ( TD ) child . Families come lab UCSF 's Parnassus campus one 2-hour visit . Parent dyads randomly assign receive either OT placebo immediately triad engages triadic discussion play task . We monitor mother ' , father ' , child 's physiological behavioral response task . In summary , randomize 2 ( diagnosis ) x 2 ( spray ) between-subjects study triadic physiology behavior child ASD TD mother father give either OT placebo .</detailed_description>
