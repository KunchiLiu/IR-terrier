	<brief_title>An Interactive Advance Care Planning Intervention Facilitate Good Death Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial tailor , multifaceted intervention conduct convenience sample 231 dyad terminally ill cancer patient caregiver number attention control group evaluate intervention 's effectiveness . Sample size calculation : There interventional study directly investigate effectiveness increase extent congruence patient prefer actual end-of-life ( EOL ) care receive terminally ill cancer patient ; therefore sample size estimation base effectiveness hold EOL care discussion patient physician extent increase congruence patient 's preferred actual EOL care receive . Patients report EOL care discussion physicians significantly likely receive EOL care consistent preference ( OR=2.26 ; p &lt; .0001 ) receive significantly few aggressive medical intervention near death , low rate CPR ( 0.8 % vs 6.7 % ; AOR , 0.16 ; 95 % CI , 0.03-0.80 ) , mechanical ventilation support ( 1.6 % vs 11.0 % ; AOR , 0.26 ; 95 % CI , 0.08-0.83 ) , ICU care ( 4.1 % vs 12.4 % ; AOR , 0.35 ; 95 % CI , 0.14-0.90 ) , respectively . A sample size 124-195 dyad per group achieve 80 % power detect difference interventional control group two-sided hypothesis test significance level 0.05 . In compensate 18.5 % attrition rate find previous longitudinal study , 147-231 dyad per group need . The propose sample size target 231 dyad per group ensure adequate power detect hypothesize effect propose intervention . Approximately 8-10 new dyad terminally ill cancer patient family caregiver recruit month . In order recruit target 462 dyad ( 231 dyad treatment group ) subject , development detail study protocol , subject start enter study begin 6th month study 54 th month follow 5th year propose study period . We enroll randomly assign eligible dyad terminally ill cancer patient family caregiver intervention attention control group 1:1 fashion without stratification . Data collection procedure : Assessments perform prospectively continue patient death , loss follow-up , study withdrawal , patient long interview . An every-3-week time frame use study repeat QOL outcome assessments patient family caregiver base review literature cover rapid change patient physical condition demand period caregiving death patient . After patient 's death , chart review postmortem interview patient ' caregiver perform confirm type medical care receive EOL . Bereavement interview conduct 1 , 3 , 6 13 month time death order avoid contamination basis anniversary grief reactions.1 Several strategy take ensure research fidelity . 1 . The propose intervention require professional skilled content , technique , delivery intervention . Built previous oncology hospice care experience , competency-based educational approach use train facilitator . The training include overview study protocol procedure , review develop workbook video , instruction motivational assessment . The principal investigator ( PI ) serve role model facilitator coach ass motivate participant different stage readiness engagement ACP cooperate physician coordinate facilitate EOL care discussion . The facilitator need successfully demonstrate predefined competency consistency delivery ACP intervention training receipt individual feedback PI formal intervention conduct . Thereafter study team meet biweekly review facilitator 's note interventional session provide feedback difficult subject management issue . 2 . Interventions provide subject assign intervention group compare receive assigned control group every 3 month . Randomly select dyad terminally ill cancer patient family caregiver treatment group interview PI check extent treatment provide consistent protocol group . 3 . To avoid bias , separate data collector hire trained study collect data intervention control group independently . Training include screen subject , obtain consent , administer project instrument without offer information ; research assistant ( RAs ) blind treatment condition . Procedures implemented insure standardization data collection . RAs reliability establish compare data collect RAs record PI five pilot case . Ninety-five percent agreement require data collection main study begin . Failure reach agreement rate require additional training acceptable reliability level reach . Intermittent reliability check carry PI throughout study maintain 95 % agreement . 4 . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) organize ensure continue patient safety well validity scientific merit trial . The DSMB constitute biostatistician experience statistical method clinical trial , nurse researcher experience conduct RCTs , physician-scientist experience cancer care . The DSMB monitor address follow issue : ( 1 ) sufficient appropriate enrollment subject , include compliance eligibility criterion dyad terminally ill cancer patient family caregiver enrol trial , ( 2 ) appropriate implementation randomization , ( 3 ) comparability baseline data treatment group , ( 4 ) protocol compliance , include treatment deliver treatment group data collection scheme , ( 5 ) adverse event ( AEs ) , quality assurance data validation registry procedures Clinical Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov . A databet record number recruitment month baseline information maintain ensure sufficient appropriate enrollment subject . A dataset capture value personnel use randomize participant maintain , thereby allow process treatment allocation reproduce verified later . The DSMB monitor appropriate implementation randomization review dataset . Interventions deliver subject assign intervention attention-controlled group compare every 6 month interview randomly select dyad terminally ill cancer patient family caregiver treatment group check treatment provide . AEs record submit study team write DSMB monthly , immediate reporting serious AEs DSMB oncologist expertise cancer care . Site report AEs/SAEs IRB dictate local requirement . No data analyze study end . Access interim result , include result accord study arm limit DSMB member statistician prepared report . The DSMB review study data every 6 month DSMB ' summary recommendation direct PI . A summary review report AEs/SAEs send local IRB ensure participate center inform pertinent safety issue . The biostatistician responsible ensure quality data submit registry predefined range independent dependent variable assess accuracy completeness registry data compare submit data original data . Data analysis interpretation : 1 . All data score entered computer spreadsheet administrative assistant blind group allocation participant . 2 . In order test baseline group equivalence , difference study group baseline characteristic identify outcome assess use two-sided Fisher 's exact test chi-square test categorical variable independent-samples Student 's t-tests continuous variable . 3 . Intention-to-treat regression analysis perform generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) examine effectiveness intervention . In intention- to-treat regression analysis , participant analyse treatment group initially allocate regardless whether complete withdraw treatment patient dy . 4 . The extend congruence terminally ill cancer patient ' prefer actual EOL care receive obtained compare agreement preference EOL care elicit last assessment actual EOL care receive patient percentage overall agreement kappa coefficient assess extent congruence correct amount agreement expect occur chance alone . 5 . Multivariate logistic regression GEE use examine impact intervention improve extend congruence terminally ill cancer patient ' prefer actual EOL care receive , secondary outcome , namely increase prognosis awareness , EOL care discussion , extent patient-family agreement preference EOL care , decrease use futile aggressive EOL care , facilitate hospice use early hospice referral , simultaneously adjust confound factor . The moderation effect prognosis awareness , EOL care discussion , patient-family agreement preference EOL care extend congruence terminally ill cancer patient ' prefer actual EOL care receive , decrease use futile aggressive EOL care , facilitate hospice use early hospice referral interventional group attention control group also examine GEE model . 7 . Multivariate multiple regression GEE use test effectiveness intervention improve patient ' family caregiver ' QOL psychological well-being ( anxiety depression ) , family bereavement outcome ( include QOL , depression , grief reaction ) , simultaneously adjust confound factor . The moderation effect prognosis awareness , EOL care discussion , patient-family agreement preference EOL care difference patient ' family caregiver ' QOL psychological well-being patient 's death , family bereavement outcomes intervention group attention control group also examine GEE model . How limiting futile aggressive EOL care extent congruence terminally ill cancer patient ' prefer actual EOL care receive moderate intervention 's effectiveness improve patient ' family caregiver ' QOL psychological well-being patient 's death family bereavement outcome also examine GEE model .</detailed_description>
