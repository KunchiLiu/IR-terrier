	<brief_summary>It establish indomethacin , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , dose 100 mg , effective reducing frequency severity pancreatitis ( inflammation pancreas ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) high risk patient . However , optimal dose require know . The purpose study determine whether dose 200 mg , administer rectal suppository , effective standard dose 100 mg. An ERCP procedure scope procedure light tube camera pass patient 's throat allow evaluation bile duct and/or pancreatic duct . The common side effect procedure post-ERCP pancreatitis , swell pancreas . Some patient high risk complication others . Our hypothesis compare efficacy two dose regimen ( 100 mg v 200 mg ) prophylactic rectally-administered indomethacin frequency severity post-ERCP pancreatitis high-risk patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After obtain informed consent , subject undergo ERCP per clinical protocol . All procedure-related clinical decision intervention dictate perform physician see fit . At end procedure , determine endoscopist research coordinator whether patient meet inclusion criterion . If inclusion criterion meet , subject randomize concealed allocation receive either 100mg 150mg indomethacin , form two three 50mg rectal suppository . Those patient randomize receive 100mg dose receive additional glycerin suppository . Four hour later , patient randomize high-dose group receive additional 50mg suppository recovery area . At time point , subject randomize standard-dose group , receive glycerin suppository recovery area . All participate patient receive total 4 suppository .</detailed_description>
