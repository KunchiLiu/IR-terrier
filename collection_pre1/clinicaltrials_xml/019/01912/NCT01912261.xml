	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine oral iron supplement ( Feramax® ) influence fatigue early postoperative recovery ( three month ) among CABG patient , effect recovery outcomes ( e.g . quality life , functional capacity , anemia , medication adherence ) . It hypothesize CABG surgery patient receive oral iron ( Feramax® ) 150mg orally ( day therapy ) 15 % reduction POF ( measure Identity Consequence Fatigue Scale ( ICFS ) ) , compare patient receive placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Oral Iron Postoperative Fatigue Upon Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative fatigue ( POF ) one main complaint approximately 39-80 % CABG surgery patient . POF significant impact individual 's quality life ( QoL ) recovery . The objective examine oral iron ( Feramax® ) influence fatigue early postoperative recovery ( three month ) among CABG patient determine effect recovery outcomes ( e.g . QoL , functional capacity , anemia , medication adherence ) . To achieve objective research aim answer follow question : 1 . Is oral iron effective reduce POF measure Identity Consequence Fatigue Scale ( ICFS ) 12 week ? 2 . If oral iron effective , effective improve fatigue , functional capacity , QoL , anemia ? 3 . To degree patient take oral iron adhere prescription ? A prospective , randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled , single-center study choose study . Three hundred participant schedule isolated CABG surgery recruit QEII Health Sciences Centre ( QEIIHSC ) , Halifax , Nova Scotia . All study participant follow three month follow hospital discharge . Data collect five time point : Time point 1 Baseline -Patients screen preadmission clinic nursing unit recruit study . During visit , patient assess eligibility , demographic data blood work collect three questionnaire six minute walk test complete participant . Time point 2 Discharge/Randomization-Patients randomize either FeraMAX® placebo hospital discharge . The treatment take daily 84 day start Day 1 ( day discharge hospital ) . The questionnaire , six minute walk test blood work repeat . Time point 3 -Post test 7 14 day post discharge A follow telephone call reminder patient take medication fill put side effect diary Time Point 4 Six week Follow up-Blood work collect three questionnaire six minute walk test complete participant . Time Point 5-End treatment-The questionnaire , six minute walk test , blood work , collect side effect diary pill count repeat clinic visit . Fatigue measure ICFS Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Anemia ( FACT-An ) questionnaire . The Short Form-36 used measure QoL six minute walk test measure functional capacity . Standard care laboratory test include ( hemoglobin ( Hgb ) level , reticulocyte count , ferritin , iron , total iron binding capacity ( TIBC ) , transferrin saturation , C-Reactive Protein level draw . Medication adherence assess pill count . The primary endpoint analyze use ANOVA repeat measure compare level fatigue two group baseline , discharge , six week 12 week . For secondary endpoint , subgroup analysis perform report participant without iron- deficiency anemia determine efficacy iron POF restrict population general population post CABG surgery . Results report use mean standard deviation appropriate median ( interquartile range ) nonparametric data . Categorical variable compare use Fisher exact test test appropriate . Level significance set p &lt; 0.05 . Oral iron inexpensive effective treatment iron deficiency occur surgical blood loss . Currently specific drug use treat POF . Standard care POF consist treat eliminate underlying symptom .</detailed_description>
