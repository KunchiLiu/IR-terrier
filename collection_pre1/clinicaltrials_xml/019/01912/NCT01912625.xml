	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose trametinib give together combination chemotherapy radiation therapy treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Trametinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving trametinib , combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy may better treatment non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) GSK1120212 ( trametinib ) combine standard chemoradiation unresectable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) safety measure rate grade 3 bad non-hematological toxicity occur prior begin consolidation therapy ( include toxicity attribute chemoradiation occur within 10 week start radiation therapy ) . II . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) analysis carboplatin , paclitaxel , trametinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate base compute tomography ( CT ) fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT image response assessment completion chemoradiation . II . Biomarker correlate response resistance . III . Overall survival . IV . Patterns recurrence . V. Determine dose delay percentage dose deliver agent . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study trametinib . CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6 week . Patients receive trametinib orally ( PO ) QD carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly . Treatment continue 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without disease progression completion chemoradiation proceed consolidation chemotherapy . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Beginning 3 week completion concurrent chemoradiation , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 22 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
