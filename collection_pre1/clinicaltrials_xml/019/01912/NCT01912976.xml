	<detailed_description>Bowen 's disease ( BD ) form intraepidermal ( situ ) squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) originally describe 1912.1 It present gradually enlarging , well-demarcated erythematous plaque irregular border surface crust scaling.2 BD frequent precancerous skin lesion Caucasians.3 In UK , BD occurrence common among patient 70 woman ( 70-85 % ) , majority ( 60-85 % ) case involve lesion low leg.4,5 BD estimate evolve invasive SCC 3-5 % case ; therefore , treatment recommended.6 Current guideline suggest available therapeutic option ( include cryotherapy , curettage , excision , topical 5-fluorouracil , topical imiquimod ) broadly similar efficacy , 12-month recurrence rate approximately 5-10 % .7 However , cryotherapy painful , make treatment multiple lesion difficult , heal slow.8 Additionally , topical treatment 5-fluorouracil imiquimod relatively slow typically cause local irritation.9,10 Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) methyl aminolaevulinate ( MAL ) attractive treatment option BD large multiple patch , poor heal site treat good efficacy , low recurrence rate , good cosmetic outcomes.7 PDT require light activation photosensitizer presence oxygen , generate reactive oxygen specie lead selective highly localize destruction abnormal cells.11,12 MAL efficient photosensitizer , deep lesion penetration result enhanced lipophilicity . Compared 5-aminolevulinic acid , MAL also great specificity neoplastic cells.13-15 Because histologic feature BD include full-thickness keratinocyte atypia disorder maturation , typically treated twice within interval 1 week.16,17 So , complementary technique need enhance penetration accumulation MAL order improve PDT efficacy decrease treatment duration . Er : YAG ablative fractional laser therapy ( AFL ) ablate stratum corneum precisely tune manner without produce significant thermal injury . This approach create microscopic vertical hole ablate tissue , surround thin layer coagulate tissue.18,19 Since Er : YAG AFL resurface 5-20 % skin one time injure entire thickness epidermis , heal time minimized.18,19 Recent study demonstrate AFL facilitates delivery uptake topical MAL deep skin , enhance porphyrin synthesis photodynamic activation.20,21 The objective study compare efficacy , recurrence rate , cosmetic outcome , safety MAL-PDT without use Er : YAG AFL Asian BD patient multiple low extremity lesion .</detailed_description>
