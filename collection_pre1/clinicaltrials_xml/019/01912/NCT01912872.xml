	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy Safety Omalizumab Treatment ICS Reduction Severe IgE-mediated Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicentric , open label , randomize , parallel-group study 12-month treatment period . Patients assign one 2 treatment group , omalizumab plus budesonide/formoterol budesonide/formoterol alone . The study comprise 4 phase : During 4-week run-in phase adult patient receive budesonide 800 mg formoterol 24 mg . If patient complies inclusion exclusion criterion receive according-to-age run-in propose dos last month , patient may continue stable-steroid phase . During 16-week stable-steroid phase , adult pediatric eligible patient randomize one two treatment group . During 8-week steroid-reduction phase , adult pediatric patient reduce 25 % budesonide baseline dose every 2 week , depend asthma control , reach 100 % reduction baseline dose . The clinical control asthma define accord criterion ( GINA 2012 )</detailed_description>
