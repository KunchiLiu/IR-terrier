	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety fix dos modify canarypox vector ( ALVAC [ 2 ] ) -cancer/testis antigen 1B ( NY-ESO-1 ) ( M ) /triad costimulatory molecule ( TRICOM ) vaccine combination INCB024360 ( IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 ) . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate toxicity define National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . ( Phase I ) III . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) use standard image response ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) criterion . ( Phase IIb ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effectiveness INCB024360 enhance vaccine efficacy assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific CD8+ CD4+ T cell . II . To determine effectiveness INCB024360 enhance vaccine efficacy assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibody . III . To determine effectiveness INCB024360 enhance vaccine efficacy assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity peripheral blood frequency CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cell . IV . To determine effectiveness INCB024360 enhance vaccine efficacy assess NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity pharmacokinetics ( PK ) IDO relation T cell frequency function correlation PFS . OUTLINE : This Phase I study follow randomized Phase IIb study . PHASE I : Patients receive ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE IIb : Patients randomize 1 4 arm . ARM A : Patients receive treatment . ARM B : Patients receive IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 PO BID day 1-28 . ARM C : Patients receive ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine SC day 1 IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 PO BID day 1-28 . ARM D : Patients receive ALVAC ( 2 ) -NY-ESO-1 ( M ) /TRICOM vaccine SC day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week ; 3 , 6 , 12 month ; annually 15 year .</detailed_description>
