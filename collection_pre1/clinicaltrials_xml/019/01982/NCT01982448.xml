	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen , participant ask undergo screening test procedure find participant research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . Additional research procedure perform time screening : A research tumor biopsy take participant begin study treatment . This different first biopsy do establish diagnosis breast cancer . A research biopsy require participate research study research do tumor tissue important part research study . The researcher want learn cancer shrink study treatment others . Tumor tissue collect research either participant 's subsequent breast surgery , , tumor respond well end study treatment , tumor biopsy participant change another regimen . - A small clip may place tumor bed time first research biopsy , particularly one place time participant 's diagnostic biopsy . The clip place surgeon locate site tumor time surgery . This consider standard care procedure breast cancer . The research biopsy do outpatient set use local anesthetic . - If participant take part study , investigator collect piece participant 's tumor tissue original biopsy , tumor remain time final surgery , piece well . As described , participant undergo breast biopsy tumor tissue collect procedure . All tissue use research . The research participant 's sample may include look gene ( DNA ) , proteins , substance make protein ( call RNA ) tissue sample . Collectively , research call biomarker research may help doctor good understand disease , drug work participant 's body , may help identify breast cancer may benefit treatment cisplatin paclitaxel . Specifically , researcher measure HRD assay analyze tumor tissue , determine result assay help predict whether cancer respond preoperative chemotherapy receive . As researcher know whether result test predictive , participant receive result research test . The tissue sample give code participant 's study information keep locked storage . The test participant 's tumor tissue research purpose would do participant study ; biomarker research . - These test perform laboratory may within outside study center participant receive study drug . The sample cod unique number . The participant 's name personal information give laboratory , study doctor able identify participant number . This research biopsy optional may store future research . - The participant 2 additional tube blood collect research purpose . These research blood sample may collect time course research study . The blood collect researcher look participant 's DNA . It important DNA order compare DNA participant 's tumor . The investigator also perform genetic test one blood sample , look gene mutation may increase risk develop certain type cancer . The blood may also use future research study . The blood store study sponsor authorize agent exhaust . This research blood collection optional may store future research . The participant `` randomize '' receive either Cisplatin Paclitaxel chemotherapy prior removal breast cancer . Chemotherapy administer removal cancer know preoperative chemotherapy . Study Drugs : - Cisplatin : If participant randomize receive Cisplatin , participant receive Cisplatin every 3 week total 4 dos . Note , dose also referred cycle . The participant give Cisplatin vein ( IV ) . The Cisplatin infusion take approximately 1 hour . Before receive Cisplatin , participant receive fluid hydration vein , participant also give medicine help prevent side effect nausea . The total time infusion Cisplatin additional fluid medication take approximately 6 hour . - Paclitaxel : If participant randomize receive Paclitaxel , participant receive Paclitaxel week 12 week total 12 dos . The participant give Paclitaxel vein . The Paclitaxel infusion take approximately 1 hour . - The study treatment stop participant serious side effect tumor grow despite receive Cisplatin Paclitaxel chemotherapy . The participant 's doctor discus participant alternative treatment option . - Physical exam : Every 3 week , approximately 2-4 week last chemotherapy dose , participant physical exam ( include weight vital sign , well tumor measurement ) participant ask general question health medication participant may take , well specific question side effect participant may experience receive study treatment . - Blood test : Prior cycle chemotherapy , participant standard blood test check blood count . About 1 tablespoon blood drawn test . - Surgery Remove Tumor : This occur within six week last dose chemotherapy ( either Cisplatin Paclitaxel ) . The participant surgeon decide type surgery ( i.e . lumpectomy mastectomy ) participant would part standard care disease . - After receive total course Cisplatin Paclitaxel chemotherapy , response breast cancer adequate surgery , option receive additional chemotherapy outside trial prior surgery . This decision participant make treat physician . If determine additional chemotherapy need , second biopsy tumor tissue perform next chemotherapy start . - Tumor assessment : The treat physician nurse practitioner examine participant every 3 week . A measurement tumor perform part physical exam . When tumor remove , research sample obtain hospital use confirm participant 's response chemotherapy participant receive . It also use see investigator learn breast cancer likely respond either Cisplatin Paclitaxel . Tumor specimens initial breast cancer biopsy surgery chemotherapy send study pathologist response tumor study treatment assess . After tumor specimen review , return hospital biopsy surgery perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study Pathologic documentation invasive breast cancer biopsy ( FNA alone adequate ) . AJCC clinical stage I T1 &gt; 1.5 cm , stage II III invasive breast cancer . Participants multicentric bilateral disease eligible least one lesion meet stage eligibility criterion study tumor HER2positive . In circumstance , investigator must determine represent target lesion assess response . This remain consistent throughout study . The target lesion select basis size ( lesion long diameter ) suitability accurate repetitive measurement . Tumors must HER2 negative define HER2 0 1+ immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) assay /or lack gene amplification FISH define ratio &lt; 2 invasive tumor local review . ER PgR status IHC must know . Tumor must ER PR negative ( ≤5 % stain ) local review . Known BRCA1/2 status require study entry . However patient know germline deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation encourage consider preoperative trial specifically design BRCA1/2 carrier , available . Breast image include image ipsilateral axilla . For subject clinically positive axilla , needle aspiration , core biopsy SLN procedure perform confirm presence metastatic disease lymph node . For patient clinically negative axilla , baseline assessment axilla perform discretion treat investigator . For patient pathologically positive axillary lymph node prior preoperative therapy , level I II lymph node dissection time definitive surgery recommend . Participants axillary adenopathy eligible study . Patients prior history contralateral breast cancer eligible evidence recurrence initial primary breast cancer within last 5 year . Women ≥ 18 year age . ECOG performance status ≤1 ( see Appendix A ) . Laboratory Evaluation Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 / mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000/ mm3 Bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , patient Gilbert syndrome , direct bilirubin measure instead total bilirubin ALT , AST , ALK Phos ≤2.5 x ULN Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl creatinine clearance ≥ 60 cc/min Hemoglobin ≥ 9 mg/dl Use effective mean contraception require subject childbearing potential since study agent know teratogenic . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy receive prior chemotherapy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patient must willing undergo mandatory research biopsy blood draw . Prior biopsy procedure patient must able medication could increase risk bleed Prior chemotherapy : Prior nontaxane platinum contain chemotherapy allow prior exposure least 5 year ago exposure think potentially interact primary outcome trial put patient undue risk , review study PI case case basis . Any prior treatment current breast cancer , include chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiation experimental therapy . Ipsilateral breast recurrence , unless prior treatment consist excision alone DCIS breast conserve treatment hormonal therapy DCIS invasive breast cancer . Ongoing use investigational study agent . Peripheral neuropathy etiology &gt; grade 1 ( NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 Appendix B ) Significant hearing loss would prevent cisplatin administration . Renal dysfunction exposure cisplatin would unsafe require cisplatin dose modification ( i.e. , Cre &gt; 1.5 mg/dl GFR &lt; 60 cc/min ) .</criteria>
