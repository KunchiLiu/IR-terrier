	<brief_title>Safety Lymph Node Injection Allergen Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) use treatment allergic disease one hundred year . SIT environmental allergy consist allergen extract traditionally administer subcutaneous sublingual route child adult . In United States , subcutaneous immunotherapy ( SCIT ) currently FDA-approved route administration allergenic extract . In recent year , novel method administer allergen immunotherapy , intralymphatic immunotherapy ( ILIT ) , develop , show safer , efficacious , less painful traditional SCIT . ILIT dramatically decrease treatment time 3 - 5 year 8 week . It study European adult . The aim project study efficacy safety intralymphatic immunotherapy adolescent young adult allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , use currently available allergen extract . Patients clinical history suspicious rhinitis without conjunctivitis , correlate positive allergy skin and/or blood test grass pollen , randomize either placebo ( normal saline ) treatment ( Center-Al grass pollen extract ) arm . A total 3 injection eight week administer intralymphatically . A third arm include observational group grass-allergic subject already receive SCIT 1 year . Primary outcome comparison safety score arm 1 2 . We follow adverse event , well serum marker Th2 Th1 phenotype , objective respiratory measure ( spirometry FeNO ) asthma . Visits occur baseline screening/enrollment , day 0/week4/week 8 injection ( injection visit arm 1 2 ) , follow-up 12 week near end grass pollen season . A substudy evaluate participant one-year complete ILIT injection obtain repeat serum biomarker level interval change medical history . Results could help dramatically decrease treatment time , well increase safety allergen immunotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1524 year Bothersome nasal , ocular , and/or respiratory symptom correlate grass pollen season ( summer ) Grass pollen allergic ( + skin prick test [ wheal â‰¥ 3 mm large negative control ] specific IgE [ minimum 0.35 kU/L ] grass pollen [ Timothy northern pasture grass mix contain Timothy ] ) Informed consent obtain sign Informed assent ( appropriate ) obtain sign Understanding study procedure Ability comply study procedure entire length study For inclusion observational group ( arm 3 ) , must initiate SCIT contain grass pollen 12 18 month prior grass pollen season 2014 ( ex . start SCIT time Dec 2012 May 2013 ) . This group include comparison traditional IT ILIT , subject continue SCIT study . Since patient undergo SCIT may see clinical response therapy 12 month , select time point well compare rapid immunologic clinical change expect ILIT . Significant yearround allergy symptom yearround symptom without worsen grass pollen season ( summer ) . ( Exception : intermittent yearround symptom significant worsen summer acceptable inclusion ) . Blood donation surgery within previous 30 day baseline/enrollment , visit # 1 . Use investigational drug within previous 90 day Pregnancy nurse Mastocytosis Significant cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , autoimmune , hematological , active infectious disease History malignancy , hypertension , use immunosuppressive agent , betablockers , ACE inhibitor , tricyclic antidepressant Pulmonary disease , include moderate severe , perennial asthma ( FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict ) perennial use inhaled corticosteroid ( exception : seasonal allergic asthma exclude ) Previous IT ( exception : observational arm currently grass SCIT ) .
