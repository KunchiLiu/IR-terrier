	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis haptic sensor aid evaluation acute abdomen . Investigators MSU Department Surgery Collaboration MSU Engineering assess ability non invasive , optical device place patient abdomen ( much like ultrasound transducer ) evaluate patient acute abdominal presentation . Conditions appendicitis , cholecystitis , diverticulitis small bowel obstruction examine haptic device . Data collect device later compare abdominal finding record examination conduct principle investigator surgeon . The surgeon ace data collect haptic sensor therefore impact decision make process care patient . The impact individual patient require obtain consent participate study , minute place device gently abdomen collect sensor data . There direct benefit patient participate study . The potential study may develop technology device non-medical staff use collect patient data transmit data healthcare provider another location .</brief_summary>
