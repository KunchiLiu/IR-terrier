	<detailed_description>Tobacco use leading cause cancer death . Because smoker quit 30 cancer death risk similar non-smokers , promote cessation early life critical . U.S. colleges/universities , enrol &gt; 14 million students/year ( 40 % age 18 24 ) , important venue reach young adult smoker . While daily tobacco use U.S. decline 18.1 % , nondaily smoke ( smoke day every day ) increase , particularly among young adult African Americans . Moreover , young smoker nondaily smoker ( half young adult smokers9 ) , respectively , less likely seek help quitting ; thus , innovative strategy need assist cessation early life , particularly among may motivate quit seek help . Unfortunately , research focus develop cessation intervention address broad range smoking pattern ( nondaily daily smoke ) diverse campus setting among ethnically diverse student population . Web-based intervention offer promise help college student quit , give high rate Internet use web capacity provide tailor cessation message . A novel approach deliver cessation information might address broad lifestyle issue apply market research strategy use tobacco industry identify market segment smoker ( group people similar interest , goal , value ) order target engage group effectively . Applying strategy online cessation intervention enhance intervention use process intervention message , lead great abstinence rate . Our specific aim : - Aim 1 : To develop refine tailor web-based intervention smoke cessation target young adult represent range sociodemographic background , particularly include low SES African American background , range smoking level ( i.e. , nondaily , low-level smoker daily , heavy smoker ) attend college . - Aim 2 : To test usability , acceptability , feasibility intervention among sample college student smoker . - Aim 3 : To determine potential effect intervention smoking cessation , smoke level , quit attempt , contextual factor ( e.g. , mood , alcohol use , social factor ) among sample college student smoker various background smoke pattern . This research address three phase . Phase 1 involve development web-site infrastructure , secure incentive , develop website content ( drama , story ) , develop tailor feedback infrastructure . Phase 2 involve expert feedback , integrate next program version . Phase 3 involves 6-week trial among small sample young adult two college campus ( university ; community/technical college ) Georgia ( N = 200 ) . At end-of-intervention , assess usability , acceptability , feasibility program ; smoke status level ; psychosocial factor relate smoking ( e.g . alcohol use , mood ) . Assessments smoke status/level psychosocial factor also conduct 6 week post-intervention . The primary outcome trial usability , acceptability , feasibility ( self-reported observe website utilization [ check-in , activity ] ) . Secondary outcome include : ( 1 ) message processing ( self-reported attention message , perceive relevance , message use item ) ; 19 ( 2 ) 7-day 30-day point prevalence abstinence end-of-treatment ( 6 week ) 6-week follow-up ( 12 week ) order appropriately examine cessation among daily nondaily smoker ; ( 3 ) smoke level 6 12 week ; ( 4 ) number quit attempt since baseline ; ( 5 ) change contextual factor ( mood , alcohol use , social aspect ) .</detailed_description>
