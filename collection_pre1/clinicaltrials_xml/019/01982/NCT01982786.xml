	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Of Image Guided External Beam Radiotherapy With Or Without High Dose Rate Brachytherapy Boost In Men With Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before big study do , small study ( call `` feasibility study '' ) require make sure patient physician willing participate study compare two kind treatment , verify radiation therapy give different centre across Canada . The standard usual treatment disease include treatment IGRT IGRT plus HDR brachytherapy boost .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm prostate adenocarcinoma . The date last biopsy verifies eligibility criterion meet must within 9 month prior randomization . There must prior treatment . Intermediaterisk cancer patient base NCCN Guidelines ( www.nccn.org ) : • TNM classification : T2bT2c Gleason Score &lt; 8/10 PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml ; T1cT2a Gleason Score 7/10 PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml ; T1cT2a Gleason Score ≤ 6/10 10 ≤ PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml For patient alpha reductase inhibitor within last 6 month , use follow guideline : T2bT2c Gleason Score &lt; 8/10 PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml ; T1cT2a Gleason Score 7/10 PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml ; T1cT2a Gleason Score ≤ 6/10 5 ≤ PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml No alpha reductase inhibitor ( i.e . avodart , proscar ) use within 2 week randomization . A washout period 2 week require prior randomization . Prostate volume ≤ 75 cc . American Urological Association ( AUA ) Symptom Index score &lt; 20 . Judged medically fit IGRT HDR brachytherapy boost radiation oncologist . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . ≥ 18 year age . Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrolment trial document willingness participate . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . Protocol treatment begin within 4 week patient randomization . HDR brachytherapy boost treatment begin within 3 week IGRT randomize Arm 2 . Participants must willing take precaution prevent pregnancy treatment . In addition routine contraceptive method , `` effective contraception '' also include heterosexual celibacy surgery intend prevent pregnancy ( sideeffect pregnancy prevention ) . However , point previously celibate patient choose become heterosexually active time period use contraceptive measure , responsible begin contraceptive measure . History transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . Prior current bleeding diathesis . Prior pelvic prostate radiotherapy . Previous history ( plan ) androgen deprivation therapy . Evidence metastatic disease . Any serious active disease comorbid medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness , active uncontrolled infection , serious illness medical condition would prevent patient participate manage accord protocol ( accord investigator 's decision ) .</criteria>
