	<brief_title>SPECT/CT Measuring Lung Function Patients With Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To utilize SPECT/CT image technetium Tc-99m microaggregated albumin ( 99mTc-MAA ) 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ( 99mTc-DTPA ) identify functional lung serial imaging patient receive radiation treatment thorax , well characterize reproducibility perfusion ventilation non-irradiated lung tissue . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate dose response relationship multiple spatial scale ( global lung , regional lung , lung image voxel ) radiation dose change lung ventilation perfusion , acutely ( mid-radiation treatment ) long term ( 3 month post-treatment ) , use SPECT/CT image 99mTc-MAA 99mTc-DTPA . II . To estimate degree radiation response lung tissue varying level function ( i.e . compare radiation dose response well ventilate well perfused tissue lung tissue poor perfusion ventilation ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate proton radiation therapy functional lung spar lung cancer cancer thorax treatment planning comparison conventional photon radiation therapy . II . To evaluate feasibility incorporate standard-of-care fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image proton photon radiotherapy planning dose escalation functionally viable region gross thoracic disease . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 99mTc-MAA 99mTc-DTPA SPECT/CT baseline , mid-radiation therapy ( 1 week post-treatment ) , 3-6 month post-treatment . Patients also undergo pre-treatment 18F FDG PET/CT scan per standard care . After completion study , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
