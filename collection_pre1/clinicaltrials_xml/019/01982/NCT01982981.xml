	<brief_title>Instrument Design Validation Asses Perception Wellbeing Associated Plain Water .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Water make majority human body ; vital ingest every day maintain proper hydration able carry different cellular process make life possible.Plain water ideal liquid perform cellular function without risk ingesting substance element could bring energy represent risk health . Currently , water ingestion recommendation offer vary dramatically among individual population ; instance , individual reside dry hot climate , well athlete , may great need water . The Dietary Reference Intake ( DRI ) suggest usual daily average ingestion adult 3.7 liter men 2.7 liter woman . In Mexico , data national health nutrition survey show highly energetic beverage consumption , soda ( carbonate ) , sugar-added sugar-free fruit juice , fresh fruit water ( `` aguas frescas '' ) sugar add whole flavored milk , double among Mexican population 1999 2006 . As , study follow specific objective : 1 . - Characterize belief , knowledge , attitude perception physical well-being result plain water consumption sample adult men woman city Cuernavaca , use qualitative technique . 2 . - Validate instrument process instrument test adjustment , feasibility test ( consistency , temporary stability , inter-rater reliability sensitivity detect change ) , content validity field expert , criterion validity correlate instrument health questionnaire SF-36 finally intervention order correlate PWBQ urine biochemical marker ( volume , osmolarity , color , density , pH , Ca , Na K ) , plain water ingestion report , physical activity level , diet , SF-36 LCF . Methods The current study objective achieve use two methodology , qualitative quantitative . For practical purpose protocol divide 2 phase : Phase 1 dedicate qualitative method design validate PWBQ instrument Phase 2 employ quantitative method evaluate PWBQ LCF intervention . Phase 1 . INSTRUMENT DESIGN ( PWBQ ) During phase , 2 qualitative techniques—focus group semi-structured interviews—will use compile require information elaborate PWBQ . Both technique focus study 's main subject `` perception physical well-being due plain water ingestion '' well identification topic-related belief , knowledge attitude , 2 specific group adult , `` light heavy plain water drinker '' , stratify variable related water consumption , nutritional state ( normal weight , overweight obesity ) gender . The definition light drinker ingest &lt; 1.5 l general liquid include food soup similar cold hot beverage like coffee tea . The heavy drinker ingest &gt; 2.0 l general liquid . The definition Normal weight define Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 18.5 - 24.99 overweight obese index 25 - 34.99 . All participant meet inclusion criterion set forth . To test FG guide , convenience sample 8 adult set socioeconomic level participate focus group session . A total 8 FG carry . In order test interview guide , convenience sample 6 healthy adult informant apply semi-structured interview . Semi-structured interview FG complete , carry new participant obtain similar information . Up 64 semi-structured interview conduct ; few do theoretical saturation reach . Convenience sample use . We look light heavy plain water drinker informant , one socioeconomic level stratify gender nutritional state ( normal weight overweight obesity ) . Qualitative phase analysis general plan . Recordings focus group interview transcribe trained personnel . After transcription , codification guide design base interview FG guide , FG interview codify undertake global analysis process , coordinate supervised 2 qualitative area-expert counselor . Information process do use `` ATLAS.ti Scientific '' software qualitative data . Content validity Once first questionnaire model define , submit group expert researcher area perception , order evaluate construct respective dimension . For evaluation , expert provide dossier contain instrument , theoretical operational definition establishes dimension instrument , `` perception well-being associated water consumption '' . Each expert present report ; discrepancy observe expert solve consensus external expert . This process take place four step : 1 ) Initial evaluation instrument , 2 ) Consensus report , 3 ) Adjustments instrument , 4 ) Final version approval . Questionnaire test adjustment target population We carry test PWBQ order ensure correct cogent question phrase target population , adequate length , appropriate categorization answer , logical order acceptable interview duration . For test , 16 adult ( men woman ) recruit meet inclusion criterion qualitative phase . Each participant inform purpose test ask his/her consent participate . Once participant finish answer PWBQ , 2 focus group organize discus detail listen correspond comment . Each FG record , obtain informed consent . Each PWBQ answer adjust base focus group comment write evaluation . Answers average Likert answer level 4 5 consider adequate , average 4 adjust restructure need . Phase 2 The PWBQ instrument product phase 1 ( qualitative ) design base structure health questionnaire SF-36 . During second phase , carry instrument validation process , use intervention . We evaluate content reliability validity carry correlation test PWBQ biochemical indicator urine ( volume , osmolarity , color , density , pH , Ca , Na K ) , total ingestion water consume , physical activity level , diet LCF instrument . Sample size calculation A total 180 participant include intervention . The sample size calculate base internal consistency analysis , consider Cronbach alpha 0.8 maximum error 5 % consider instrument could 30 40 question . This sample size ( n=180 ) allow u estimate correlation 7.0 10 % maximum error CI 95 % , PWBQ urine variable , total water consumption , physical activity level , diet LCF . Logistics A total 180 participant recruit form 2 group 90 subject ( intervention control ) , ideally try include equal proportion normal overweight men woman ( figure 5 ) . Visit 1 During visit 1 2 , check participant light drinker meet rest inclusion criterion previously mention . During visit , follow instrument apply , order check criterion : 1 . Integral health evaluation ( weight , height , waist circumference ) 2 . Liquid consumption frequency ( LCF ) 3 . Questionnaire PWBQ well-being perception 4 Health questionnaire SF-36 4 . 24-hour recall 6 ) Physical activity questionnaire ( IPAQ ) At end visit , participant receive instruction go clinic 1 week later morning 24-hour urine sample , give special bottle correspond instruction collection . Intermediate week On Monday visit 1 2 , phone call make every participant implement LCF evaluate weekend consumption . Visit 2 , ( one week later ) . During visit , participant provide 24-hour urine sample analysis go entire evaluation visit 1 . They subsequently inform eligible participate study . We explain study purpose ( informed consent letter ) inform upon completion study , receive incentive package ask want participate . If , sign letter inform consent . Once accept participant study , 2 group randomly form ( control intervention ) 40 accelerometer randomly assign ( 20 group ) , finally , give detailed explanation use next appointment schedule . The estimated average time required participant day 30 45 minute total . The clinic offer healthy food interested . The intervention group receive plain water weekly basis 8 week , daily consumption . Water supply deliver Bonafont company home address participant . Bottles top numbered mark project 's name . Each time participant ask return spare bottle order quantify total ingestion . Every 2 week , control intervention group give appointment accelerometer reading . Visits 3 4 ( week 2 8 begin intervention ) participant ( control intervention ) bring 24-hour urine sample appointment , read accelerometer take instrument implement . General analysis plan The data obtain used evaluate agreement correlation ingest water biochemical indicator urine , PWBQ , LCF , r24hrs SF-36 . Finally , differences intervention control group evaluate , order determine difference due water availability identify possible bias suggest corrective equation . Descriptive statistic generate , use simple partial correlation , regression model multivariate method ( factor analysis ) .</detailed_description>
