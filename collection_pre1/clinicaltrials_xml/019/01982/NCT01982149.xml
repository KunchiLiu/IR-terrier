	<detailed_description>Lung cancer , largely result cigarette smoking , lead cause cancer death United States , kill 160,000 people 2010 , breast , colorectal , prostate cancer combine . Since 10 % heavy smoker develop lung cancer 20 % lung cancer develop nonsmoker , think genetic predisposition play important role . Without screen , lung cancer detect early stage 10 % time , translate 7 % cure rate . Published study screen lung cancer use CT scan show detectable early stage 85 % time , translate cure rate 60 % . However , sample population 1000 smoker age 60 ( high risk individual ) , 233 suspicious abnormality CT scan , 27 lung cancer . Two concern apparent . First , among 233 individual suspicious abnormality CT , one choose one suspicious enough biopsy , surgery , invasive procedure ? Generally , follow-up CT scan several month use assess abnormality growth , since growth characteristic malignancy . Unfortunately , repeat CT scan involve financial cost potential radiation risk . An additional technique able predict predisposition lung cancer , combine ability CT scan detect abnormality real time , could prove powerful platform efficiently screen lung cancer reduce mortality . Lung cancer develop consequence series genetic injury cell line airway cause bronchial cell grow malignant manner , unchecked , resistant normal homeostatic control . By study gene expression signature airway ( bronchial ) line cell , difference observe normal nonsmoker , individual expose smoke second-hand , smoker develop COPD ( chronic bronchitis emphysema ) . Some genetic change bronchial line cell near lung cancer specific lung cancer -- - `` field effect . '' Obtaining bronchial lining cell genetic analysis require invasive expensive procedure , fiberoptic bronchoscopy , therefore bronchoscopically acquire bronchial lining cell suitable screen public lung cancer . The lining cell nose , nasal epithelium , part human airway , many similarity bronchial epithelium , much accessible . A gentle scraping nasal line involves risk patient , less cost , , hop , provide genetic information bronchial lining cell . This study propose examine genetic correlation nasal bronchial epithelium hop develop office-based test identify patient 's risk lung cancer . It hop genetic analysis nasal epithelium may combine risk factor lung cancer cigarette smoking , age 50 year , obstructive ventilatory impairment note pulmonary function test find ideal ( enrich ) population screen CT detect early lung cancer , thus reduce financial cost , radiation exposure , risk invasive procedure minimum , further ultimate goal `` personalized medicine .
