Study drug administer adjunct glatiramer beta interferon treatment . A total 250 male female subject 21 65 year old , inclusive , plan enrol two treatment group . Randomization subject stratified disease status ( primary progressive multiple sclerosis secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ) immunomodulating therapy status : current use immunomodulating therapy current use immunomodulating therapy . The study consist screen phase ( 30 day ) follow treatment phase ( 96 week ) follow-up visit ( 1 month post Week 96 visit ) . Following screen phase , subject continue meet entry criterion randomly assign 1 2 treatment group : dos ibudilast 100 mg/day matching-placebo 1:1 ratio .
