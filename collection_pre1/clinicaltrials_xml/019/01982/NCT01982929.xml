	<brief_summary>Patients Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital ( MRRH ) Uganda present routine caesarean section often go without set post-operative pain control regimen . Due lack establish protocols supply essential pain control medication reliable , upwards 90 % woman receive postoperative pain control . There regional technique effective , easy perform , low risk , inexpensive . One techniques tranversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block . A TAP block regional anesthesia technique provide analgesia parietal peritoneum well skin muscle anterior abdominal wall [ 1 , 3-7 ] . First describe decade ago , undergone modification technique , show useful provide 12-24 hour significant post-operative pain relief wide array surgical procedure [ 2 ] . It best use cornerstone multi-modal approach pain control combine well oral intravenous opioid non-opioid medication . This technically straightforward procedure involve injection local anesthetic within fascial plane locate two deep muscle layer ( transversus abdominis internal oblique muscle ) low abdominal wall . Given simplicity TAP block long-lasting diminution post-operative pain many abdominal pelvic surgery , incorporation TAP block post- caesarean section pain management consider achievable simple remedy lack reliable pain mediation surgical delivery MRRH . This study examine efficacy tranversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block provide post-operative analgesia caesarean section spinal anesthesia Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital ( MRRH ) Uganda , Africa . We look value TAP block supplement routinely use ( available ) post-operative non-opioid oral analgesic regimen . Primary Hypothesis : The administration TAP block completion caesarean section decrease level pain measure visual Numerical Rating Score ( NRS ) 8 , 16 24 hour , rest movement . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . The administration TAP block completion caesarean section increase satisfaction score 8 , 16 , 24 hour ; 2 . The administration TAP block decrease prevent need postoperative nurse- administer pethidine ( meperidine ) `` rescue '' medication . This prospective , randomize , double-blind , sham control , single-center trial . A total 240 patient enrol study . Following completion caesarean section , patient screen enrollment study . Enrollees randomly assign arm via predetermine undisclosed random number generator known staff MRRH . The anesthesiologist perform TAP sham block give seal envelope study arm patient randomize . The study procedure TAP block place 50 % enrollee . TAP BLOCK : Physicians fully trained performance potential risk technique place TAP block ultrasound-guidance . Briefly , sterile condition , ultrasound use identify targeted abdominal fascial plane . Once locate , predetermine amount local anesthetic inject . This perform , bilaterally . The patient monitor block 30 minute follow . SHAM BLOCK : Sham block consist non-invasive ultrasound scan abdomen . To mimic injection medicine , dull/blunt object gently press either side abdomen . The patient monitor sham block 30 minute follow .</brief_summary>
