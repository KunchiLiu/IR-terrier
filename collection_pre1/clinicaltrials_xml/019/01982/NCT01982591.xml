	<brief_title>Heavy Metal Exposure Predicting Peripheral Neuropathy Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe correlation , , specific heavy metal high grade symptom peripheral neuropathy , define grade &gt; = 3 peripheral neuropathy , ( utilizing Common Terminology Criterial Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] version [ v. ] 4.0 ) cohort breast cancer patient undergo ( neo ) adjuvant taxane chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize range specific heavy metal cohort breast cancer patient undergo ( neo ) adjuvant chemotherapy treatment . II . To evaluate reproducibility serum urine test heavy metal level inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) test cohort breast cancer patient undergo ( neo ) adjuvant taxane chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo serum urine sample collection heavy metal analysis ICP-MS baseline completion treatment . Patients also complete neurotoxicity assessment questionnaire baseline completion treatment .</detailed_description>
