	<brief_summary>Observational research link physical activity faster recovery , improve quality life , great survival ; however , little known effect physical activity pre-operative , peri-operative , post-operative treatment context need intervention improve patient outcomes across cancer treatment continuum . Three proposition derive basic research , epidemiological evidence , clinical practice inform intervention development effort : ( 1 ) Patient outcomes enhance intervention increase physical activity ( i.e. , stand , walk ) across cancer treatment continuum ( i.e. , pre-operative , peri-operative , post-operative ) . ( 2 ) Reducing sedentary behavior ( i.e. , seat reclined activity involve minimal energy expenditure ) enhance patient outcomes increase physical activity stimulate additional adaptive physiological response reduce sedentary time ( response independent physical activity-induced response ) . ( 3 ) Patients gastrointestinal cancer often suffer functional limitation limit independence health behavior strongly influence family environment intervention engage caregiver ( e.g. , spouse ) effective target patients/survivors alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intervention Motivate Standing &amp; Walking Gastrointestinal Cancer Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 Screening Baseline Assessment Clinic Patients recruit physician upon diagnosis immediately Penn State Surgical Oncology team present surgical treatment option . The patient must able identify adult caregiver . The caregiver must someone willing participate study intervention period . Once enrol research assistant , participant complete intake questionnaire capture demographic information . The participant give tablet computer , train use complete questionnaire begin end day , activity monitor material secure , train how/where affix leg . In study , use educational material deliver initial enrollment session daily `` fact day '' present electronically heighten awareness ( 1 ) risk insufficient physical activity excessive sedentary behavior , ( 2 ) expect beneficial outcome increase physical activity reduce sedentary behavior . These message design increase intention engage physical activity limit sedentary behavior ( motivational phase ) . Although intention necessary behavior change , recent review experimental evidence indicate sufficient . In volitional phase , people translate intention action develop action plan specify when/where/how act ( e.g. , lunch I go 30 min walk around neighborhood ) cop plan specify overcome anticipated barrier desire behavior ( e.g. , rain lunch , I go mall walk 30 min ) . Repeated planning nature basis break exist behavioral habit form newer ( hopefully adaptive ) one . We already develop electronic daily plan tool use begin day form action cop plan target behavior intervention . In first two month project , tailor exist plan tool target population draw exist emerge research strategy barriers health behavior among cancer patient . The control group receive educational daily plan component motivational intervention . They , however , engage self-monitoring virtue wear activity monitor use tablet computer provide self-report data physical activity sedentary behavior . After patient 's surgery stay Penn State Hershey Medical Center , study coordinator provide caregiver behavioral goal help patient recover his/her surgery , additional information caregiver support patient 's behavior change effort . Phase 2 : Intervention Period For duration study , participant : - Complete beginning-and end -of-day questionnaires tablet computer . The beginning day questionnaire evaluate patient 's intention plan daily physical activity . The end day questionnaire evaluate actual physical activity complete daily well patient 's physical , emotional , social well-being . - Wear activity monitor For participant experimental group research assistant also : - Deliver educational intervention patient caregiver first visit sign consent form . - Train patient use daily planning tool prior begin -of- day prior beginning-of-day questionnaire . The theoretical basis intervention draw social-cognitive theory ( i.e. , Health Action Process Approach [ HAPA ] ) self-determination theory . The Health Action Process Approach differentiate motivational volitional phase action control . In motivational phase , people form intention goal behavior base factor risk awareness outcome expectation . In study , use educational material deliver initial enrollment session daily `` fact day '' present electronically heighten awareness ( 1 ) risk insufficient physical activity excessive sedentary behavior , ( 2 ) expect beneficial outcome increase physical activity reduce sedentary behavior . These message design increase intention engage physical activity limit sedentary behavior ( motivational phase ) . Although intention necessary behavior change , recent review experimental evidence indicate sufficient . In volitional phase , people translate intention action develop action plan specify when/where/how act ( e.g. , lunch I go 30 min walk around neighborhood ) cop plan specify overcome anticipated barrier desire behavior ( e.g. , rain lunch , I go mall walk 30 min ) . Repeated planning nature basis break exist behavioral habit form newer ( hopefully adaptive ) one . We already develop electronic daily plan tool use begin day form action cop plan target behavior intervention . In first two month project , tailor exist plan tool target population draw exist emerge research strategy barriers health behavior among cancer patient . Self-determination theory posit social factor , family relationship , also influence motivation . Our recent work use experience sample methodology accelerometry show spouse ' autonomy support patient physical activity spouse 's level physical activity associate patient ' great daily moderate physical activity step take Individuals whose family member health care provider show autonomy support increase physical activity decrease sedentary behavior likely make change reason come within freely choose . Because close family member influence emotional physical well-being patient , inclusion behavioral intervention logical potential boost effect intervention . In study , caregiver educate importance autonomy support behavior change strategy support partner 's autonomy around physical activity sedentary behavior change across stage treatment . This education deliver nurse coordinator initial education session follow enrollment . Collectively , three component patient education , daily planning , caregiver education assemble strengthen intention desire health behavior ( motivational phase behavior change ) , increase likelihood intention translate action ( volitional phase behavior change ) , provide social resource support behavior change phase . The control group receive educational daily plan component motivational intervention . They , however , engage self-monitoring virtue wear activity monitor use tablet computer provide self-report data physical activity sedentary behavior . During intervention period study coordinator also contact patient via phone weekly ask question related patient safety include question frequency fall mild/moderate/severe , chest pain , dizziness , musculoskeletal soreness pain , change swell . Phase 3 : Follow-Up Telephone Call The research assistant call participant 30 , 60 , 90 day surgery ass frequency hospital readmission emergency room visit since discharge . Phase 4 : Follow- Up Questionnaire 21 day discharge form hospital , participant caregiver complete brief questionnaire mail self-addressed stamp envelope .</detailed_description>
