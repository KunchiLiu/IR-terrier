Moreover , The Competence Centre Transcultural Psychiatry ( CTP ) monitoring team monitoring data register data come . - Data check : GCP well mention monitor team data check audit time trial run . - Source data verification : ass accuracy , completeness representativity registry data , monitoring team CTP trial compare data register manually doctor , psychologist , physiotherapist social worker e.g . paper fill patient . Data register patient trial also register patient participate trial . By compare data , show representativity data population . - Standard Operating Procedures : All adverse event register individual patient record period first consultation centre last consultation centre patient .

Differences quantitative outcomes less ½ SD two treatment consider less relevant clinical point view . Cut-offs available several rating scale , use define categorical outcome variable . If example proportion cut-off clinical case status 50 % 25 % two group , power close 80 % detect significant group difference . Data analysis : The primary outcome variable difference treatment course calculate difference start , middle end rating . The unadjusted difference two intervention group measure t-test , adjustment difference baseline value possible background factor ( gender age ) do ANCOVA/linear regression . In addition , cut-off use symptom score logistic regression analysis carry over/under cut-off binary outcome . In addition completer analysis , drop-out analysis intention-to-treat analysis carry . Hypotheses concern predictor treatment effect analyse include potential predictor linear logistic regression model include treatment group relevant covariates .</detailed_description>
