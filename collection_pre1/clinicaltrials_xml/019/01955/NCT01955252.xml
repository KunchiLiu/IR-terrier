	<brief_title>Effect WHO-yaws Elimination Strategy Lihir Island , Papua New Guinea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yaws re-emerging endemic treponemal infection cause Treponema pallidum subp pertenue . This bacterium cause chronic relapse disease , characterize highly contagious primary secondary cutaneous lesion non-contagious tertiary late destructive lesion . The Pacific Islands believe major focus yaw worldwide , though population-based data prevalence lack many country . Azithromycin ( 30mg/kg ) recently show effective treatment yaws central WHO 's yaws eradication strategy . Substituting single dose oral antibiotic painful penicillin injection significant advantage infection control measure require injection penicillin longer require treatment acceptable community need . Previous attempt eradicate yaws mass treatment active case injectable drug yield unsuccessful result . A major campaign eradicate yaw 1950s 1960s longacting , injectable penicillin greatly reduce number case disease worldwide incubate latent case treat developed relapse infectious yaws lesion , thereby become source reinfection . While early strategy 1950s , target people visibly infect , new WHO-plan call blanket coverage least 90 % population . The ratio clinically apparent latent case symptom estimate high 1:6 mass drug administration ( MDA ) entire population best approach ensure incubate latent infection adequately deal . The currently recommend treatment eradication one dose oral azithromycin ( 30 mg/Kg ; maximum 2g ) give entire population area know harbor yaw . For MDA effective , require substantial coverage first round . The initial mass treatment follow resurvey every 6 month detect treat remain case . Because potential bacterial resistance appearance treatment failure need monitor . Macrolide resistance associate point mutation position A2058 A2059 23S ribosomal RNA gene molecular analysis need do clinical specimen patient respond treatment .</detailed_description>
