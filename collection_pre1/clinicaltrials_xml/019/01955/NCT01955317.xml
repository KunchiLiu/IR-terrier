	<brief_summary>Background ( brief ) : 1 . Burden : Neonatal death still unacceptably high low income country . The common cause neonatal death pneumonia , sepsis omphalitis . Many neonatal infection occur mother 's hand hand person attend birth unclean . Our previous study find substantial concern excessive exposure mother neonate water handwash perception frequent contact water could lead respiratory illness . 2 . Knowledge gap : Chlorhexidine evaluate use hand hygiene application high-income country , particularly healthcare , evaluate promoted hand cleanse household level low- middle-income country . 3 . Relevance : A waterless hand cleanser employing chlorhexidine would overcome important barrier handwash soap , perception cold result exposure water , time limitation perceive mother . Hypothesis : Mothers expose chlorhexidine-based hand cleanse intervention clean hand ( chlorhexidine soap water ) frequently mother expose chlorhexidine-based hand cleanse program . Objectives : The primary objective 1 . To demonstrate behavioural impact chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene intervention hand cleanse mother neonatal period The secondary objective 2 . To demonstrate impact chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene intervention hand cleanse family member , visitor neonate , birth attendant neonatal period 3 . To evaluate acceptability chlorhexidine hand cleanse neonatal period among mother , family member , birth attendant Methods : We propose randomize controlled trial rural area Bangladesh , active control . Randomization level participate pregnant woman . Each arm include 150 participant . All intervention visit follow baseline data collection . A trained health hygiene promoter carry two visit antenatal period one postnatal visit deliver intervention message . Outcome measure : 1 . Observed hand cleanse behavior mother chlorhexidine soap water critical time . 2 . Observed hand cleanse behavior household member visitor home chlorhexidine soap water critical time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Waterless Hand Cleansing With Chlorhexidine During Perinatal Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neonates ( baby &lt; 28 day old ) die unacceptably high rate ( 26deaths per 1000 live birth ) many resource-limited country , account 40 % death among child 5 year old . Infections pneumonia , sepsis , omphalitis common cause neonatal death . Many neonatal infection occur mother 's hand hand person attend birth unclean . In Nepal , newborns survive significantly likely newborn die mother report handwashing , birth attendant report wash hand delivery . But , mother birth attendant often wash hand , despite vulnerability neonatal period . The traditional approach improve handwash among caregiver young child teach critical time wash hand wash hand . This narrow , prescriptive approach ignore barrier hand hygiene unique Perinatal neonatal period . Moreover , qualitative finding suggest frequent handwashing water may acceptable . That , mother birth attendant report , mother come contact water frequently ( e.g . wash hand often ) , newborn child risk develop upper low respiratory infection . A novel technological solution - one provide efficiency portability obviates need wash water - may overcome important obstacle improve hand cleanse behavior neonatal period . During discrete time frame neonatal period , chlorhexidine hand cleanse represent focus intervention substantial potential scalability . The shelf-life chlorhexidine long ( 2-3 year ) , facilitate scale efficient distribution , example , clean delivery kit provide low-income mother throughout resource-limited country . Given potential low-technology solution break critical barrier handwash water soap , markedly reduce neonatal mortality , propose conduct randomize control trial evaluate impact chlorhexidine-based hand cleanse intervention maternal , familial , birth attendant hand cleanse behavior peripartum neonatal period . Methods Study design We propose randomize controlled trial rural area Bangladesh , active control . The two treatment arm : - Active control arm Maternal neonatal health counseling ( describe `` Intervention '' section ) - Intervention arm - Maternal neonatal health counsel - Hand hygiene promotion ( describe `` Intervention '' section ) Randomization level participate pregnant woman ( i.e . individual-level randomization ) . We use block randomization strategy randomize participant either intervention active control arm . The intervention : All intervention visit follow baseline data collection . A trained health hygiene promoter carry two visit antenatal period ( 34-35 week 36-38 week ) one postnatal visit ( 1-3 day delivery ) deliver intervention message . Maternal neonatal health counseling : Study participant intervention control arm receive maternal neonatal health counseling . The objective maternal neonatal health counseling : - Highlight vulnerability neonatal period - Inform participant family schedule recommend Government Bangladesh prenatal care strongly encourage participant seek appropriate prenatal care , include Tetanus Toxoid vaccination . Tetanus toxoid provide free cost part antenatal care Government Bangladesh health facility . - Discuss birth plan encourage participant develop birth plan , include location birth , material , person need emergency plan . - Introduce discus use clean delivery kit hygienic delivery reduce infection . This include instruction cut umbilical cord . Provide clean delivery kit participant , include clean blade , clean string tying cord , clean mat mother lie , among item . - Encourage close family member motivate demand hand wash soap birth attendant labor delivery . - Discuss maternal danger sign participant family encourage care seek recognize - Discuss neonatal danger sign participant family encourage care seek recognize - Discuss neonatal hypothermia prevention participant family work family build acceptance message - Discuss benefit immediate exclusive breastfeeding participant family work family build acceptance message - Provide chlorhexidine gauze , explain chlorhexidine cord care participant work family . Materials : Each participant give clean delivery kit culturally appropriate pictorial card depict danger sign mother pre- , , post-labor , neonate . Description behavioral communication approach : Interactions health hygiene promoter form discussion health/hygiene promoter facilitate discussion provide explanation guidance need . Hand hygiene counseling : Objectives hand hygiene counseling : - Present hand cleanse opportunity mother protect health child , improve perception good mother - Remind vulnerability newborn period , suggest use chlorhexidine hand cleanse make love hand protective hand - Encourage maternal self-efficacy protect health baby - Identify motivator barrier hand cleanse among mother people care baby - Identify critical time hand cleanse chlorhexidine - Increase individual social ( family/compound ) expectation hand cleanse among mother caregiver - Guide family create solution barrier hand cleanse - Introduce chlorhexidine product help protect baby 's health , demonstrate use discus , use . - Discuss demand motivate use chlorhexidine family member , visitor birth attendant - Set visual cue card , calendar visual reminder home reference cue hand cleanse specific critical time - Discuss create habit hand cleansing , concretely mean Critical time hand cleansing : - For mother secondary caregiver : - Before umbilical cord care - After contact respiratory secretion - At three fixed time day : morning , lunch , evening : give residual antimicrobial effect chlorhexidine , hand cleanse fix time result hand protect contamination much day . - For visitor household child : - Before touch neonate - After contact respiratory secretion contact nasal oral mucosa Timing intervention visit : Respondents randomize intervention arm receive one hand hygiene promotion second visit ( 36-38 week gestation ) prior review maternal neonatal health counseling . Chlorhexidine hand cleansing : We position chlorhexidine product unique importance neonatal period , may substantive bactericidal bacteriostatic effect , make superior soap hand cleansing , particularly vulnerable newborn period . Data collection Identification pregnant woman selection criterion : The propose study conduct 4 union Mirzapur already demographic surveillance . Pregnant woman routinely identify part demographic surveillance . Obtaining informed consent baseline data collection : A data collector describe study pregnant woman 32-34 week gestation seek inform consent participation . The data collector also request inform consent head household interview secondary caregiver regard practice labor delivery process , two structure observation hand cleanse behavior among household member . Randomization initiation intervention : We use block randomization strategy , use block 4 , randomize participant either intervention active control arm . Block randomization also refer `` restrict randomization '' allow number intervention arm roughly similar control arm throughout enrolment period . Objectives 1 2 : Hand cleanse behavior measurement To compare treatment arm respect mother ' hand cleanse behavior neonatal period ( Objective 1 ) , follow : 1 . Observe hand cleansing , either use chlorhexidine handwash water + soap , 3-hour structure observation 2 . Measure residual sanitizer weight volume marker chlorhexidine consumption Structured observation involve placement study staff member participant 's home / household compound extend period time order observe typical behavior . In study observation conduct intervention treatment arm female field staff sit suitable place observe mother without get way normal care give activity neonate . We interested observe follow behavior structure observation ( Appendix 6 ) . Hand cleanse critical time ( either chlorhexidine use wash hand soap water ; handwash soap consider corollary chlorhexidine use since control arm access chlorhexidine ) Objective 3 : Acceptability chlorhexidine In group , record participant- household member-initiated reporting skin reaction , possible adverse event , acceptability chlorhexidine respect ease use , scent , skin comfort occurrence skin reaction ( Objective 3 ) . At approximately day 28 neonate 's life , conduct end line survey ( Appendix 7 ) mother , ass follow quantitative manner intervention group : - Acceptability chlorhexidine - Reported use chlorhexidine versus handwash hardware - Behavioral determinant hand hygiene We collect qualitative data subset mother intervention arm understand in-depth barrier motivator chlorhexidine use hand cleanse conclusion quantitative data collection .</detailed_description>
