	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria cause small parasite carry mosquito . People get malaria infect mosquito bite . Malaria destroy red blood cell . Most malaria mild , child develop severe malaria , kill 660,000 people annually . About 9 10 die malaria Sub-Saharan African child , 5 year old . Scientists save many life find prevent relieve severe malaria . Objective : - To know common medicine call activate charcoal reduce severe malaria symptom . Eligibility : - Children 2 11 year old mild malaria live Kenieroba , Mali . Design : - For first 2 day night , participant stay hospital . - They medical history take , physical exam . - Blood drawn thin tube insert hand forearm . This do 3 time overall . A drop blood take finger prick 12 time overall . - An antimalarial drug inject tube arm 4 time . Each time drug give , participant drink small cup either water activate charcoal . - For follow 3 day , participant take antimalarial pill . - On day 7 , participant visit hospital . A drop blood finger prick test malaria parasite .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Oral Activated Charcoal Ability Antimalarial Drug Kill Parasites Malian Children With Mild Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While incidence Plasmodium falciparum malaria decline ( 1 ) proportion case severe malaria ( SM ) may increase ( 2 ) . The mortality associate SM endemic country remain high despite use artesunate ( AS ) ( 3 ) . Safe , cheap , effective adjunct therapy prevent development , reduce mortality , SM could considerable rapid public health impact . We discover oral administration activate charcoal ( oAC ) , safe treatment acute poisoning ( 4 ) , protect mice experimental cerebral malaria demonstrate randomize control trial ( RCT ) African adult oAC safe interfere pharmacokinetics AS ( 5 ) . Here , propose next step evaluate efficacy adjunct treatment oAC Malian child explore mode action . Before test adjunct treatment oAC child SM , perform open-label RCT child uncomplicated malaria ( UM ) demonstrate non-inferiority intravenous ( IV ) AS plus adjunct oAC vs. IV AS alone regard parasite clearance rate . This study conduct African child , primary target population intervention . Although adequate standard-of-care treatment UM oral ( PO ) administration artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) , treat participant IV AS . Like ACT treatment UM , AS WHO-recommended first-line treatment SM ( 1 ) . In order data obtain UM case meaningful future study child SM , administer AS UM case trial via IV route use administer AS SM case . Exploratory objective include : ( ) compare kinetics plasma cytokine group , ( ii ) preserve RNA gene transcription analysis future study mode action oAC . The study nest within NIAID-funded study ( Principal Investigators Drs . Fairhurst , Diakite ) assess parasite clearance rate response AS treatment Kenieroba ( 6 ) . Children age 2-10 year UM initial parasite density 10,000 70,000 parasite per micro L enrol . Parasite clearance rate express parasite half-life ( Ph ) , estimate parasite clearance curve use formula validate cohort ( 7 ) . Children randomize 1:1 receive IV AS+oAC IV AS , respectively , complete specimen data set 35 child per group obtain . oAC administer Actidose Aqua [ register ] 0 , 6 , 12 , 18 hour . AS administered IV follow WHO recommendation use AS SM ( 8 ) , follow 3 daily dos amodiaquine ( AQ ) . Subsequently separate study , plan proof-of-concept RCT determine whether adjunct oAC reduces disease severity morbidity ( assessed score system ( 9 ) ) hospitalize child SM define mode action oAC . Since oAC license , inexpensive drug without sophisticated storage requirement , extremely long shelf life room temperature give orally via nasogastric tube high dos without major side effect ( 4 , 10 ) , drug ideal profile use primary health-care level reduce mortality SM , even prevent development SM .</detailed_description>
