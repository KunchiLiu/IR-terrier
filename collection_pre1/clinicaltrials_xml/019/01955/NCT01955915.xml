	<brief_title>Blood Vessel Patterns Small Choroidal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uveal melanomas melanocytic tumor arise pigment tissue eye : iris , ciliary body , choroid . Iris melanomas rarely metastasize ( spread tissue organ ) . In contrast , uveal melanoma arise ciliary body choroid highly malignant ( cancerous invasive tissue organ ) . Despite excellent local tumor control rate , uveal melanoma remain life-threatening cancer , even eye-sparing therapy radiation treatment often lead significant loss vision . Therefore patient diagnosed uveal melanoma must cope life-threatening illness , also frighten prospect significant vision loss . Choroidal melanoma locate posterior pole , anatomical area eye include optic nerve macula ( central retina ) , particular concern regard visual outcome , radiation treatment area even small tumor often associate severe vision loss . The accurate diagnosis treatment small choroidal melanomas critical patient survival . When tumor metastatic potential recognize treat early stage , survival prognosis improve dramatically . The purpose study learn malignant ( life-threatening ) choroidal tumor versus benign ( non-life-threatening ) tumor show distinct blood vessel pattern use functional optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) angiography . Angiography map blood vessel . The investigator believe OCT angiography provide data may help identify life-threatening tumor early stage improve overall survival patient type melanoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults old age 18 small ( &lt; 3mm ) choroidal tumor locate within posterior pole region image use OCT technology . Subjects benignappearing malignantappearing lesion meet criterion enrol . Inability give inform consent . Inability maintain stable fixation OCT imaging . Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , subject become eligible . Women pregnant lactating time enrollment due unknown safety fluorescein angiography . Women become pregnant course study may remain enrolled ; however , flurorescein ICG angiography perform longer pregnant nursing infant . Patients receive treatment uveal melanoma exclude longitudinal natural history portion study , may enroll single study visit prior treatment melanoma . They eligible enroll IRB 9501 , follow radiationtreated patient longitudinally .</criteria>
