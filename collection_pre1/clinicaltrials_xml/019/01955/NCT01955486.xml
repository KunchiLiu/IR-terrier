	<brief_summary>The purpose study gather information Eustachian tube function middle-ear pressure fly . Ten subject tympanostomy tube ( plastic tube insert eardrum ) ears holes ear-drums undergo flight simulation pressure chamber . Their middle-ear pressure Eustachian tube function monitor various chamber pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There individual experience severe barotrauma/barotitis airplane flight and/or free tank diving . Previously , one investigator model change middle-ear ( ME ) pressure simulate airplane flight ear normal Eustachian tube function ( ETF ) different degree Eustachian tube ( ET ) dysfunction ( Kanick SC , Doyle WJ . Barotrauma air travel : prediction mathematical model . J Appl Physiol . May 2005 ; 98 ( 5 ) :1592-1602 ) . That model provide number important insight pathogenesis ME barotrauma include two assumption validate : 1 ) absence ET opening , ME pressure relatively stable ( ignore tympanic membrane volume induce change ) wide range ambient pressure , 2 ) ET periluminal pressure track local ambient pressure . Other , less rigorous , description ME pressure behavior flight dive make different assumption : 1 ) ME pressure change change ambient pressure 2 ) ambient ET mucosa pressure incompletely couple . Modeling ME pressure behavior use two set assumption predicts different ME pressure trajectory explanation barotitis/ME barotrauma flight diving . Because behavior ME pressure flight ( dive ) constrains intervention could use prevent barotitis/ME barotrauma , important determine , either , model correct . Ten otherwise healthy subject age 18 50 year unilateral bilateral eardrum perforation ventilation tube enrol obtain Informed Consent . Complete histories take focus ear-related problem ENT examination include tympanometry document patency ventilation tube absence drainage tube ( disqualifiers ) . Eligible subject study pressure chamber typical flight simulation periodic interruption ascent descent . During simulation , one ME fit ear-canal probe attach pressure transducer probe attach Forced-Response test system . ME pressure continuously monitor one ear Forced-Response test do chamber pressure atmospheric , decrease pressure ( ascent flight ) 500 daPa interval , stable `` cruise '' cabin pressure , increase pressure ( descent flight ) 500 daPa interval atmospheric pressure . All transducer reference chamber pressure signal rout via A-D box memory computer on-line display storage . Outcome variable consist continuous measure ME pressure one ear periodic measure ET opening pressure , close pressure , passive resistance dilatory efficiency contralateral ear . Under model , expect , active/passive ET opening , ME pressure relatively stable affected change chamber pressure measure ET periluminal pressure ( open pressure , close pressure passive resistance ) track chamber pressure .</detailed_description>
