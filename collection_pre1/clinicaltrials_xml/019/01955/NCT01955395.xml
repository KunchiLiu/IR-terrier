	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate effect mind body medicine intervention call Relaxation Response Resiliency Program ( 3RP ) stress stress relate symptom patient monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance ( MGUS ) smolder multiple myeloma ( SMM ) . This research study supportive care trial . This mean intervention program may improve general well-being comfort , consider treatment `` cure '' MGUS SMM . It consider investigational intervention investigator examine effectiveness new program - 3RP - reduce stress stress-related symptom patient MGUS SMM . Standard management MGUS SMM involve regular monitoring without chemotherapy . Mind-body medicine , define National Institutes Health , `` focus interaction among brain , mind , body , behavior , powerful way emotional , mental , social , spiritual , behavioral factor directly affect health . '' The 3RP newly design group therapy program variety mind body principles self-care intervention seek buffer stress promote psychological resiliency physical well-being . This study examine effectiveness 3RP reduce stress symptom associate stress patient diagnose MGUS SMM . Data study also use assess change gene expression result 3RP intervention , particularly genetic pathway know dysregulated MM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask question find participant research study : - A medical history , include question participant 's physical mental health , current medication , allergy . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant receive study intervention . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . - After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : - Collections Visit One : After screen visit confirms participant eligible participate , participant schedule Collections Visit One . At Collections Visit One , participant complete : - A demographic questionnaire : This include question participant 's age , gender ethnicity . - A series questionnaires : These ask participant 's overall wellness take 30-45 minute complete . - A small blood sample collection : Trained nursing staff take 1.5 tablespoon blood single prick participant 's arm . This procedure take 10-15 minute . This provide sample research test may help investigator 's learn study treatment affect participant 's gene express . - OPTIONAL - Bone marrow , plasma serum collection : This collection optional described detail Section O . Trained nursing staff take 1 tablespoon bone marrow standard bone marrow aspirate procedure . This procedure take 20-30 minute complete , however time use get everything ready ( prepare skin ) well 5-10 minute reserve relaxing procedure complete . This provide sample research test may help investigator learn study treatment affect participant 's disease . ( This collection optional described detail section O . ) - Since effect study intervention medication may know , important participant tell research doctor prescription non-prescription drug , herbal preparation nutritional supplement participant take plan take . - Randomization : In order measure effect intervention , participant `` randomize '' one study group Collections - Visit One : Immediate Group Waitlist Control . The Immediate Group receive study intervention within two week Screening Collections Visit One procedures . Randomization mean participant put group chance . It like flip coin . The participant equal chance place either group . Both group receive intervention course study , different time point . - If participant assign Waitlist Control group , Collections Visit One follow 3 month wait intervention . The participant would attend Collections Visit Two , follow intervention ( 3 month ) Collections Visit Three . - If participant assign Immediate Group , Collections Visit One follow intervention ( 3 month ) . participant would attend Collections Visit Two , follow 3 month continue practice participant learn intervention , Collections Visit Three . - After Collections Visit One , participant give group assignment calendar future study visit indicate potential date , time location participant 's study visit . - Study Intervention : The intervention consist one intake psychologist ( approximately 60 minute ) , 8 3RP session week course 8 week ( approximately 1 hour 30 minute ) , one exit visit ( approximately 30 minute ) course 3-months . All intervention visit take place Benson-Henry Institute Mind Body Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital . - During intervention ( follow period Immediate Group ) , participant ask practice participant learn intervention listen 20-minute audio CD daily . Additionally , participant ask keep track daily practice fill online paper log . During 3RP session , clinician address barrier problem participant may daily practice help problem solve participant . - Collections Visit Two : This visit Collections Visit One . - Collections Visit Three : During visit , participant complete : - A series questionnaires : These ask participant 's overall wellness , take 30-45 minute complete . - A small blood sample collection : Trained nursing staff take 1.5 tablespoon blood single prick arm . This procedure take 10-15 minute . This provide sample research test may help investigator learn study treatment affect participant 's gene express . - The investigator also collect information regard change participant medical history since last visit . Research Study Plan : Immediate Group - Screening Visit : Week 1 - Collections Visit One : Week 1 2 - 3RP Session One : Week 3 - 3RP Session Two : Week 4 - 3RP Session Three : Week 5 - 3RP Session Four : Week 6 - 3RP Session Five : Week 7 - 3RP Session Six : Week 8 - 3RP Session Seven : Week 9 - 3RP Session Eight : Week 10 - Collections Visit Two : Week 11/12 - Follow Up Period ( home practice ) : Weeks 13-21 Collections Visit Three : Week 22-24 Waitlist Control - Screening Visit : Week 1 - Collections Visit One : Week 1 2 - Waiting Period : Weeks 2-10 - Collections Visit Two : Week 11 12 - 3RP Session One : Week 13 - 3RP Session Two : Week 14 - 3RP Session Four : Week 15 - 3RP Session Five : Week 16 - 3RP Session Six : Week 17 - 3RP Session Seven : Week 18 - 3RP Session Eight : Week 19 - Collections Visit Three : Week 22 , 23 , 24 - Planned Follow-up ( Immediate Group Only ) : The investigator would like keep track participant 's home practice medical condition 12 week completion 3RP intervention . The investigator would like contact participant e-mail phone month see participant . By Keeping touch participant check practice condition every month help investigator look long-term effect research study . At end 12 week , participant come last study visit - follow visit , describe .</detailed_description>
