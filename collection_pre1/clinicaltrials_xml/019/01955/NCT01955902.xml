	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study perform focus group identify prioritize feature SubAID application ( APP ) . The SubAID APP smartphone APP create support patient self-managing buprenorphine/naloxone ( bup/nal ) medication . Many people difficulty manage bup/nal prescribed manner . Not take medicine prescribe manner cause negative health outcome . Focus group participant ask elaborate medication-taking pattern work best , pitfall associate poor adherence offer opinion upon features/functions SubAID APP perform helpful . The focus group design remain open-ended allow free discussion regard particular topic moderator bring .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Opioid dependence ( OD ) serious medical social quandary impact life million , include disparate demographic population United States . Economic societal cost prescription opioid abuse United States alone estimate $ 56 billion number drug poison death attribute opioid analgesic triple since 1999 . In 2008 , opioid analgesic involve great 40 % drug poisoning fatality . Opiate-agonist pharmacotherapy utilize buprenorphine/naloxone ( bup/nal ) know decrease illicit opiate use . However , poor medication management misuse self-managed opioid substitution therapy ( OST ) constrain efficacy , aggrandize relapse , hospitalization mortality . In adherence study , OST patient mismanage medication &gt; 10 time likely relapse compliant patient . [ 5 ] Thus , one inescapable challenge confront health care professional treat OD assure medication take prescribed inhibit relapse . Yet , threat successful medication mismanagement substance use disorder unique traditional chronic disease . While ultimate goal substance abuse treatment abstinence , opioid addiction chronic , relapse medical condition . Opioid substitution therapy , incorporate methadone bup/nal , represent conventional treatment option opioid dependence . Methadone maintenance adequate dos reduce craving , prevents onset withdrawal , intoxicate sedating , interfere normal activity daily live . However , significant pitfall denote methadone maintenance treatment . Methadone long-acting , full opioid agonist know abuse diversion potential upper boundary level respiratory depression -- overdose therefore fatal . In addition , relapse rate methadone maintenance range 55-90 % follow treatment . Although effective therapy , high rate relapse diversion render methadone less ideal solution many patient . Recently , bup/nal formulation , commonly sell SuboxoneÂ® , design minimize abuse diversion retain positive aspect methadone treatment . Bup/nal proven correspondingly effective treat OD methadone , efficient certain population . Clinical study show beneficial effect bup/nal treatment reduce subsequent opioid use . Administered sublingually , naloxone undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism negligible bioavailability ; thus , use prescribe , combination drug ( bup/nal ) produce effect buprenorphine alone . However , inject , naloxone precipitate withdrawal opioid dependent patient . Thus , bup/nal intend reduce risk illicit use injection . An additional benefit bup/nal OST unsupervised use . Unlike methadone maintenance , generally entail daily clinic visit , bup/nal allow patient increase freedom , typically require one physician pharmacy visit per month stabilization period . Given low abuse appeal , strong effectiveness , clear ability lower relapse rate , bup/nal represent suitable treatment option OD , especially still work individual . In spite move toward unsupervised self-managed OST bup/nal , monitor promote effective medication adherence challenge number reason include diversion , lack motivational support avoid opioids , low health literacy . Affording patient caregiver interactive toolset effectively monitor promote medication management OST therefore represent major unmet need project address . This research project develop interactive smartphone/tablet application ( APP ) , name SubAID , design engage support patient receive bup/nal promote monitor adherence . In order develop appropriate effective adherence support content SubAID APP , solicit opinion Focus Groups OD subject prescribe bup/nal well understand adherence complication problem encounter daily basis .</detailed_description>
