	<brief_summary>Bladder carcinoma common malignancy urinary tract . Approximately 75-85 % patient bladder cancer present disease confine mucosa submucosa . These category group non-muscle-invasive bladder tumor ( i.e . superficial tumor ) . Bladder cancer fifth common cancer United States , estimate 67,160 newly diagnose case 13,750 death United States 2007 . The 5-year survival rate 82 % stage combine . The standard treatment patient superficial bladder cancer surgical transurethal resection ( TUR ) tumor , 80 % early success rate . However , nearly 70 % patient develop tumor recurrence , 25 % show progression muscle-invading disease , within 5 year TUR . It therefore necessary consider adjuvant therapy patient . The absolute risk recurrence progression always indicate risk certain therapy optimal . The choice therapy may consider differently accord risk acceptable individual patient urologist . Intravesical chemotherapy immunotherapy widely use adjuvant therapy TUR , prevent recurrence progression superficial disease . Systemic therapy typically reserve high stage , muscle-invading , metastatic disease . The urinary bladder ideal organ regional therapy . The urethra provide easy access therapeutic agent urinary bladder . The presence specialize asymmetric unit membrane urothelium serve barrier limit absorption molecule particulates systemic circulation . The rationale intravesical therapy maximize exposure tumor locate bladder cavity therapeutic agent limit systemic exposure thereby limit host toxicity ; primary goal eradicate exist residual tumor direct cytoablation immunostimulation . The unique property urinary bladder render fertile ground evaluate novel approach regional therapy , include local hyperthermia , co-administration permeation enhancer , bioadhesive carrier , gene therapy . One develop treatment high-risk superficial bladder cancer combination intravesical chemotherapy hyperthermia ( HT ) , call chemohyperthermia ( C-HT ) . The common form C-HT us Synergo HT system , local HT administer via direct microwave irradiation urothelium mean 915-MHz intravesical microwave applicator . The target intravesical temperature set 41.8C 44.8C measure five thermocouple integrate 20-F treatment catheter . To avoid injury , urethra continuously cool . Due extensive global experience use significant amount preclinical data demonstrate improved antineoplastic efficacy heat , mitomycin C ( MMC ) common intravesical chemotherapy agent use conjunction HT . The common adverse event treatment bladder spasm bladder pain . Literature report bladder spasms 21.6 % patient , bladder pain 17.5 % . Bladder spasm tend occur frequently prophylactic schedule , whereas pain present equally prophylactic ablative schedule commonly ablative schedule . In first day follow C-HT , storage LUTS ( frequency , dysuria , urgency , nocturia ) ( 25.6 % ) hematuria ( 6.0 % ) common adverse event . Most study mention symptom mild transient , resolve spontaneously within day treatment . One study describe severe cystitis complaint three patient ( 16 % ) , study confirm adverse event . Two study report development contract bladder severe urinary incontinence ablative C-HT . However , possibility exclude previous transurethral resection intravesical chemotherapy might contribute event . Following appearance bothersome storage LUTS , patient manage exist guideline . Based AUA/SUFU Diagnosis Treatment Overactive Bladder ( Non-Neurogenic ) Adults Guidelines publish 2012 patient diagnose , follow treat accord suggest algorithm . In study , would like assess severity OAB symptom response standard OAB treatment accord AUA Guidelines Non-neurogenic OAB well assess urodynamic study variable n't respond standard medical treatment bother OAB symptom .</brief_summary>
