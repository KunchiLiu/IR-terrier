	<brief_summary>Introduction Parastomal hernia common complication related colostomy . The variability diagnostic criterion , fallow time sometimes subclinical dimension , detectable imaging , explain disparate figure cite literature ( 0-58 % ) ( 1 ) . The generally accepted rate around 50 % ( 2 ) . However , several author consider actually , almost patient present parastomal hernia long-term fallow ( 3 ) . Prophylactic prosthetic mesh could reduce incidence complication , reinforce since begin weak peristomal area abdominal wall . Existing scientific evidence , although positive , limited allow clarify controversial issue type prosthetic mesh use optimal position mesh relation abdominal wall ( 4-8 ) . The use laparoscopic approach colorectal surgery increase also set technical change placement mesh . To date , technical note ( 9 ) two publish prospective , observational study include patient underwent laparoscopic surgery . In first study intraperitoneal ( 10 ) second retromuscular mesh ( 11 ) use , encourage short-term result , need scientific support . Study Design This prospective , randomize , single center , clinical study sample represent patient undergo elective laparoscopy assist colorectal surgery , creation permanent end colostomy . Patients accept participate suitable inclusion study randomize one two branch consecutively : Treatment A : Conventional definitive end colostomy ; Treatment B : Definitive end colostomy reinforce retromuscular mesh Ultrapro . Aims Evaluate compare result obtain place prosthetic mesh prevent parastomal hernia end colostomy versus realization end colostomy conventional technique . Primary Objective : Compare incidence parastomal hernia group monitor period . Secondary objective : Compare overall specific postoperative morbidity mortality group , compare difference surgical time conventional technique prosthetic mesh group , compare hospital stay group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Definition parastomal hernia Parastomal hernia consider happen one follow situation : - Parastomal protrusion spontaneously Valsalva maneuver , evidence observation palpation , explore patient supine stand position - Protrusion intrabdominal content fascial hole , evidence abdominal computed tomography , case without clinical evidence hernia obese patient whose exploration difficult . For description parastomal hernia use clinico-radiological classification describe Moreno et al . ( 12 ) . Ethical Issues The study approve regional ethic committee . The patient candidate study inform person surgeon team receive write information . Informed consent obtain patient accord guideline establish ethic committee prior randomization study . Patients free leave study time . To ensure optimal treatment patient arm study , analysis conduct throughout inclusion process compare incidence parastomal hernia , specific morbidity mortality specific relate use prosthetic mesh . If observed difference significant , would stop study . Patient Selection Inclusion criteria 1 . Patients colorectal disease require realization definitive end colostomy 2 . Laparoscopy assist intervention 3 . Interventions intend radical treatment case oncologic pathology 4 . Signed informed consent patient representative case incapacity Exclusion criterion 1 . No acceptance participate inability obtain sign informed consent 2 . Urgent intervention 3 . Palliative intervention 4 . Lateral colostomy 5 . American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) Classification IV-V Randomization Statistical Analysis The incidence parastomal hernia accord literature around 50 % . Furthermore , accord prospective randomize study perform prophylactic mesh , incidence varies 5 % 22 % depend follow-up period definition use ( 4-6,8,10,12 ) . In control group incidence problem approximately 50 % case incidence prophylactic mesh group 15 % . With result , set value type I error 5 % ( Î± = 0.05 ) , bilateral approximation consider estimate loss 5 % fallow , number patient 30 group ( power 80 % ) . In case meeting inclusion criterion accept patient , randomization : Group A : Conventional definitive end colostomy Group B : Definitive end colostomy reinforce retromuscular mesh Ultrapro Randomization perform computer-generated sequence concealment randomization order make use sealed opaque envelope . The technique use case know time intervention open envelope order surgery . Actuarial analysis morbidity , mortality recurrence index perform study ( every 30 patient include ) . The analysis do intention treat effective treatment . Technical Aspects In mesh group , synthetic prosthetic mesh low weight type Ultrapro ( 15x15 cm ) use . It place sublay position rectus abdominis muscle posterior rectus sheath , suture posterior rectus sheath absorbable multifilament stitch . Once position fix mesh bowel bring cross cut center mesh Finally , colon fix colocutaneous end end absorbable multifilament suture . Perioperative Care Preoperative : Colon preparation , antibiotic thromboembolic prophylaxis carry accordance standard center apply equally study arm . In patient colostomy site mark abdomen day surgery , stoma therapist . Intraoperative : Anesthesia conduct accord standard center apply equally study arm . Postoperative : In accordance standard center apply patient . Fallow Monitoring realize clinical control ( 15 day 2 , 6 , 12 month ) abdominal compute tomography first year . Expected Results Statistically significant reduction incidence parastomal hernia patient undergo elective laparoscopy assist colorectal surgery realization end colostomy reinforce retromuscular mesh collocation .</detailed_description>
