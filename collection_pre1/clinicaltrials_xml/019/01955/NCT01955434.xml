	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well second mitochondrial-derived activator caspase ( SMAC ) mimetic LCL161 alone cyclophosphamide work treat patient multiple myeloma return respond treatment . Biological therapy , SMAC mimetic LCL161 , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give SMAC mimetic LCL161 alone cyclophosphamide effective treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SMAC Mimetic LCL161 Alone With Cyclophosphamide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate confirm overall response rate ( &gt; = partial response [ PR ] ) LCL161 ( SMAC mimetic LCL161 ) , use single agent , patient relapse multiple myeloma ( MM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate confirm overall response rate LCL161 combination cyclophosphamide , cyclophosphamide add LCL161 lack response progression . II . To estimate overall survival event-free survival patient treat LCL161 combination cyclophosphamide , cyclophosphamide add LCL161 lack response progression . III . To evaluate tolerability LCL161 alone combination cyclophosphamide patient relapse MM . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine degradation cellular inhibitor apoptosis protein-1 ( cIAP1 ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , change serum cytokine , change immune cell subset flow cytometry . II . To correlate effect LCL161 presence activate mutation nuclear factor kappa beta ( NFKB ) pathway . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) LCL161 alone , LCL161 combination cyclophosphamide . IV . To describe patient-reported health-related quality life symptom . OUTLINE : Patients receive SMAC mimetic LCL161 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients lack minor response end course 2 partial response end course 4 may also receive cyclophosphamide PO QD day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 discretion treat physician . Patients take cyclophosphamide le 25 % interval reduction paraprotein receive SMAC mimetic LCL161 day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
