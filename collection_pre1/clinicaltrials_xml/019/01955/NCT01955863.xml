	<detailed_description>Radical prostatectomy initially describe Walsh ( 1982 ) become gold standard treatment prostate cancer evolve enormously last 25 year . Improvements include use small incision , reduce blood loss , short hospital stay , surgical refinement . Several large series long-term follow-up confirm approach result excellent cancer control functional result term preservation erectile potency urinary continence . Regarding morbidity access open retropubic radical prostatectomy lot center around world start develop laparoscopic robotic approach past year . The problem regard technique pure laparoscopic prostatectomy show steep learn curve high initial complication rate , use robotic assistance surgery despite low learning curve associate higher surgical supply operative room cost . These cost may significant impact overall cost prostate cancer care especially Brazil nowadays 3 center 5 robot . In Brazil , open route radical prostatectomy still frequent approach , mainly large city . One disadvantage open prostatectomy minimally invasive surgery long hospital stay . However , question length stay operation optimal necessary unresolved . In trial investigator compare randomized group patient discharge postoperative day 2 , 1 day surgery . The investigator intent evaluate feasibility ambulatory open radical prostatectomy ( patient discharge day surgery - average 12 hour hospitalization ) maintain patient satisfaction safety .</detailed_description>
