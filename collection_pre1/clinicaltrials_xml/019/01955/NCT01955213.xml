	<brief_summary>Methylnaltrexone treatment opioid-induced constipation set palliative hospice care , significantly effective placebo ( 1 ) . However , randomize open-label phase multi center trial show favorable outcome , drug produce rescue-free laxation half patient ( 2 ) . There may several reason result , since constipation palliative care patient often multiple simultaneously occur cause . Assuming constipation non-responders still opioid-induced , one possible reason respond methylnaltrexone could central action opioids contribute constipation reduce motility intestine direct action spinal dorsal horn ( 2 ) . However , methylnaltrexone µ-receptor antagonist opioids solely µ-receptor agonist another reason may well successful laxation determine receptor-profile specific opioid patient use . Opioids influence bowel functioning , also immune system function angiogenesis . Methylnaltrexone possibly antagonize change , therefore study also investigate influence methylnaltrexone immunologic angiogenic parameter .</brief_summary>

This define dose reduction ≥ 50 % , dose increase permit . If rescue medication prescribe different type opioid regular dose opioid , rescue medication switch type regular dose opioid least 3 day first dose methylnaltrexone . Has diagnosis constipation , define either &lt; 3 bowel movement previous week history clinically notable laxation* 24 hour first dose methylnaltrexone , No clinically notable laxation* 48 hour first dose methylnaltrexone . Constipation define opioid induce , determine investigator On stable laxative regimen ≥ 3 day first dose methylnaltrexone . This define least one type laxative adequate dose regimen , ( e.g . macrogol 2 packet daily , magnesium ( hydr ) oxide 500 mg three time daily , bisacodyl 10 mg daily sennoside A+B 10 ml daily ) least two type laxatives suboptimal dose patient characteristic hamper optimal treatment .
