	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide ibrutinib treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma return respond treatment . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving lenalidomide ibrutinib may work good treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination lenalidomide ibrutinib patient relapse refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) . II . To define qualitative quantitative toxicity combination lenalidomide ibrutinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe overall objective response rate combination lenalidomide ibrutinib patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL . II . To describe response duration two-year progression free survival ( PFS ) patient B-cell NHL receive lenalidomide ibrutinib . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics combination lenalidomide ibrutinib patient relapse refractory B-cell NHL . IV . To identify association genetic polymorphism drug metabolize enzyme , transporter target gene pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , clinical outcome . V. To monitor effect combine therapy ibrutinib lenalidomide B- T- , natural killer ( NK ) -cell subsets flow cytometry quantitative immunoglobulin level . VI . To explore effect combination ibrutinib lenalidomide pharmacodynamic marker include T helper cell , type 1 ( TH1 ) T helper cell , type 2 ( TH2 ) cytokine , ex vivo NK cell cytotoxicity , serum micro ribonucleic acid ( RNAs ) , plasma metabolite , level Bruton 's tyrosine kinase occupancy select kinase . VII . To explore relationship pretreatment pathologic prognostic feature overall objective response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) day 1-21 ibrutinib PO day 1-28 ( day 2-28 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
