	<detailed_description>Introduction Physical activity beneficial aspect health , physical fitness metabolic control mental psychosocial well-being . These benefit particularly important child adolescent undergo active development building foundation future success . Unfortunately , Hong Kong child become less less physically active . Data government survey 2009 show 34.2 % child age 7 12 year least 60 minute moderate vigorous activity five day week 3 month period . Another recent survey report 6.6 % secondary school student Hong Kong meet WHO recommend standard physical activity - 60 minute moderate vigorous activity every day . In fact , 27.1 % adolescent even moderate vigorous physical activity day past week . Upsurging adolescent problem identify Hong Kong , include smoking , underage drinking , substance abuse , deterioration mental well-being ( D. T. Shek , 2006 ) . Take mental health example . Mental health problem estimate affect 10 20 % child adolescent worldwide ( Kieling et al. , 2011 ) , result short-term long-term adverse consequence ( Johnson , Roth , Schultz , &amp; Breslau , 2006 ) . Conventionally , mental health problem tackle use disease model , focus disease treatment . However , recognise recent decade primary prevention would important improve overall mental well-being child adolescent ( Kieling et al. , 2011 ) . Instead traditional disease model , strength-based positive prevention model call upon , Positive Youth Development ( PYDs ) one successful one target adolescent . To understand concept PYD , important glimpse traditional view adolescence . The transition period locate second decade human lifespan conventionally regarded period 'storm stress ' ( Hall , 1904 ) . It suggest adolescent often alternate extreme sorrow exuberance ( N. Holt , 2008 ) . Nonetheless , later recognise emphasis negative characteristic disproportionately much new perspective adolescent development emerge . This new perspective later name PYD . Instead conventional deficit-reduction ( 'disease ' ) approach , PYD focus strengthen adolescent ' internal external asset problem could prevent alleviate . Since establishment new concept 80 90 , grow number research conduct investigate actual implementation model . The PYD model could implement many context , argue sport physical activity one suitable ( Fraser-Thomas , Cote , &amp; Deakin , 2005 ; Larson , 2000 ; Perkins &amp; Noam , 2007 ) . Actually claim consistent 'QK Blog ' , exist adolescent strengthen platform ( Kwai Tsing Safe Community Healthy City Association , 2012 ) . Nevertheless , actual benefit sports-based PYD problem rarely investigate , especially China ( Coakley , 2011 ; Fraser-Thomas et al. , 2005 ) . Therefore , conduct present project promote two major aspect among adolescent Hong Kong : physically activity adolescent development . Purpose/Objectives/Aims This project explore possibility foster positive adolescent development tailor community-based youth project Kwai Tsing district Hong Kong . Specifically , physical activity would benefit adolescent term physical , psychological/emotional , social development , together form important foundation healthy productive adult life . The project incorporate physical activity intervention guide behavioural theory secondary school-based setting . Project Overview This two-phase project Phase I preparatory stage Phase II Implementation stage . Phase I mainly focus attitude , perceive benefit barrier among various stakeholder , include student , parent , teacher . The stakeholder interview focus group set survey use questionnaire . The data collect Phase I analyse , guide design implementation Phase II - actual implementation intervention . In addition result Phase I , thorough literature search also conduct order understand exist evidence regard correlate physical activity well theoretical construct promote adolescent development sport / physical activity . Recruitment To ensure sufficient support school , contact secondary school physical education teacher graduate Department Physical Education , Hong Kong Baptist University . A formal invitation letter send school , outline background , implementation , expect outcomes programmes . Telephone call also make school ' principal , extra-curricular master , physical education ( PE ) panel head discuss feasibility detail implement programme school . To allow flexibility , school may participate either Phase I Phase II , depend preference . The Phase I PE teacher survey questionnaire send directly 454 secondary school . All school Hong Kong invite obtain representative sample , may inform current intervention programme relevant research service future . Intervention Design Design intervention guide empirically result Phase I literature review . The theoretical framework practical implementation intervention follow : Framework Our programme inform two theoretical framework : first , Theory Planned Behaviour ( TPB ) encourage student ' participation sport PA , second , Positive Youth Development ( PYD ) framework enhance student ' holistic development . The TBP successful framework predict physical activity behaviour young people ( Craig , Goldberg , &amp; Dietz , 1996 ) . It find attitude , perceive behavioural control , subjective social norm strong influence take part physical activity . In particular , effect self-efficacy attitude PA even significant control youth 's past PA habit . In word , improve student ' self-efficacy attitude may increase participation PA , regardless current activity level . Whereas TBP could assist motivate student ' participation PA , PYD framework may help define structure programme enhance holistic adolescent development . Specifically , adapt United States National Research Council Institute Medicine ( NRCIM ) suggestion develop programme . Apart principle , also blend well-established psychological theory present programme . For example , regard person guide facilitate exercise session 'mentors ' instead 'coaches ' . These mentor teach student sport skill , also responsible maintain exercise session fun , democratic empowering . The mentor also educate mean establish 'mastery-oriented ' atmosphere , instead 'performance-oriented ' one , teach exercise . The former attitude encourages constant improvement student later one encourage comparison performance within group . Previous psychological experiment show people mastery-oriented attitude would motivate constant improvement . All mentor programme introduce present programme principle support project member , include health physical education expert .

During stage , mentor help student realise current sporting skill , act start point goal set . Skill Building stage major component programme . Students instructed reach goal practice play . Finally , Reflection sessions student reflect improvement barrier encounter Skill Building stage assistance mentor . The inclusion reflection ensure student ' benefit programme consolidate could sustain longer period .
