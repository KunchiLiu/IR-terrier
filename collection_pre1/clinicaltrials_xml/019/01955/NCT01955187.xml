	<brief_summary>In study , investigator evaluate long-term efficacy safety ( two year ) Tacrolimus-Rituximab ( RTX ) therapy compare Methylprednisolone-Cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) therapy patient primary Membranous Nephropathy ( MN ) . PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether sequential therapy tacrolimus lead great increase proportion primary MN patient Complete Partial Remission compare patient receive standard treatment . It assess 24 month begin treatment . Phase trial : design : Phase III study , open label , randomize , active control trial . This study 3 stage : screening recruitment patient 18 month , treatment period six month corticosteroid plus CYC group 9 month Tacrolimus-RTX group , finally post-treatment follow-up period complete 24 month follow-up since initial treatment . This study compare standard therapy primary MN patient nephrotic range proteinuria ( active control steroid plus CYC ) novel sequential therapy tacrolimus RTX , approach potential high efficacy , low toxicity acceptable safety profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS/OUTCOME MEASURES Primary end-point : The proportion patient reach CR define reduction proteinuria since baseline level value equal low 0.5 g/24 h proteinuria plus stable renal function ( eGFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73m2 ) PR define reduction proteinuria since baseline level value le 3.5 g/24 h 50 % low baseline proteinuria plus stable renal function ( eGFR ≥ 45ml/min/1.73m2 ) 24 month study treatment . Secondary end-points - The proportion patient Limited response ( LR ) define reduction proteinuria since baseline level &gt; 50 % value &gt; 3.5g/24 h. 12 , 18 24 month study treatment.. - The number patient increase ≥ 50 % serum creatinine ( SCr ) baseline 12 , 18 24 month ( end follow-up ) . - The time renal survival ( status free increase ≥ 50 % baseline SCr ) arm overall study . - The proportion patient preserve renal function ( estimate GFR ≥ 60 ml/min ) treatment arm treatment period . - The proportion patient relapse ( defines reappearance proteinuria &gt; 3.5 gr/24h least 50 % increase low baseline value least three consecutive visit patient previously present PR CR ) time relapse treatment period . - Serum level anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody ( anti-PLA2R ) , treatment 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 24 month study , treatment arm . - The proportion patient drug-related adverse event serious adverse event . STUDY POPULATION Patients biopsy-proven idiopathic primary membranous nephropathy nephrotic proteinuria normal slight decrease renal function enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients willing able read correctly understand patient 's information sheet give consent participation study ( correctly sign date informed consent form document , previously approve Ethics Committee/ International Review Board ) , initiate protocol specific selection procedure . Patients able understand study procedure comply entire length study . Age old 18 year . Biopsyproven primary MN . Patients nephrotic syndrome relapse remission ( either spontaneous induced immunosuppression ) include without new renal biopsy , provide meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Estimated GFR ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73m2 one measurement perform within screen period ( 30 day inform consent signature ) . Nephroticrange proteinuria ( &gt; 4 g/day decrease &gt; 50 % last 6 month ) accompany hypoalbuminemia ≤ 3 , 5 g/dL screen period OR patient show severe disable symptom relate nephrotic syndrome severe hypoalbuminemia ( &lt; 2 g/dL ) , include completion 6month observation period , investigator 's discretion , independently proteinuria value . Treatment ACEI ARB least 2 month screen ( unless intolerance ACEI/ARB , contraindication use low blood pressure could induce side effect investigator 's discretion ) control blood pressure least last three month ( Mean SBP/DBP ≤ 150/90 mmHg last three month ) . Negative urine pregnancy test potentially fertile female . Diagnosis secondary cause membranous nephropathy : malignancy ( cancer ) , systemic infection ( include B C hepatitis ) , systemic autoimmune disease ( e.g . Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ; SLE ) acute chronic inflammatory disease . HIV infection . Moderate severe liver disease ( AST ALT &gt; 2.5x upper range limit total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper range limit ) . Patients take part study investigational study and/or receive receive treatment another investigational drug intervention ( within first month prior signature informed consent ) . Suspected known hypersensitivity , allergy and/or immunogenic reaction history either rituximab , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , corticosteroid , CYC ingredient ( include excipients ) drug pharmacotherapeutic group ( i.e . calcineurin inhibitor , specific monoclonal antibody alkylating agent ) . Previous treatment corticosteroid three month period screening , previous treatment immunosuppressive agent six month period screen . Previous treatment rituximab biological agent two year period screening . Patients nonresponders previous immunosuppressant . Women positive pregnancy test screen lactation period plan become pregnant within next 24 month . Women willing use contraceptive method complete study period . Inability unwillingness individual legal guardian/representative give write informed consent . Any medical unstable , uncontrolled , severe condition relevant laboratory test finding , investigator 's discretion , could possibly increase associate risk patient 's participation study . Current drug alcohol use dependence , opinion site investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement .</criteria>
