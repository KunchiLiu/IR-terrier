	<brief_title>Vascular Response Brachytherapy Using Functional OCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite excellent local tumor control rate , uveal melanoma remain life-threatening cancer , even eye-sparing therapy radiation treatment often lead significant loss vision . Major challenge provide care patient uveal melanoma include inability accurately predict long-term vision eye treat radiation , due poor understanding nature radiation retinopathy optic neuropathy . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) commonly use ophthalmic imaging modality provide precise , real-time data vivo non-invasive manner . Our research group recently develop two novel functional OCT technology : ( 1 ) Doppler OCT quantitatively measure total retinal flow ( 2 ) OCT angiography technology map optic nerve head , retinal , choroidal blood flow unprecedented accuracy . The investigator believe technology utilized improve understand radiation-induced vascular change optic nerve retina cause vision loss patient treat radiation , well provide tool monitor tumor response treatment . In study , investigator intend utilize novel functional OCT technology describe change time optic nerve head retinal blood flow I-125 radiation therapy , evaluate relationship change flow decrease vision . The investigator also study association change flow total radiation dose receive optic nerve head macula , varies base upon tumor location size .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults age 18 old uveal melanoma involve ciliary body and/or choroid undergo I125 plaque brachytherapy . Inability give inform consent . Inability maintain stable fixation OCT image Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , subject become eligible . Women pregnant lactating time enrollment due unknown safety fluorescein angiography . Women become pregnant course study may remain enrolled ; however , flurorescein ICG angiography perform longer pregnant nursing infant .</criteria>
