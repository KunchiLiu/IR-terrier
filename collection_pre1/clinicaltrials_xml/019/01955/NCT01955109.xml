	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy common allergy United States , prevalence general population high 1 % . So far , approve treatment peanut allergy . Peanut allergy management base strict peanut avoidance injectable epinephrine allergic systemic reaction start . Specific Immunotherapy method currently available show limitation use safety issue . Hence , important unmet medical need efficient safe treatment peanut allergy . DBV Technologies develop epicutaneous delivery system , call Viaskin , method base deliver precise quantity allergen upper layer skin . Avoiding contact allergen bloodstream confer epicutaneous immunotherapy ( EPIT ) high level safety systemic reaction circumvent The OLFUS-VIPES study open-label follow-up study subject previously randomize complete VIPES efficacy safety study . Subjects offer enrollment follow-up study receive additional 24 month Viaskin Peanut treatment follow period 2 month without treatment maintain peanut-free diet . The trial conduct site VIPES study investigator staff train experience diagnosis management peanut allergy anaphylaxis , capable perform double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge ( DBPCFC ) adult and/or pediatric subject . According current amend study protocol , subject enrol OLFUS-VIPES study complete VIPES study receive high dose Viaskin Peanut , i.e . 250 mcg peanut protein , regardless prior treatment ( placebo , 50 mcg , 100 mcg 250 mcg Viaskin Peanut ) receive VIPES study . Subjects already enrol OLFUS-VIPES study initial protocol design switch receive 250 mcg dose Month 6 Month 12 treatment OLFUS-VIPES study upon approval amend protocol site . The study remain blinded subject VIPES study unblinded . All subject complete OLFUS-VIPES study receive overall 24 month active treatment follow period 2 month without treatment subject assess sustained unresponsiveness .</detailed_description>
