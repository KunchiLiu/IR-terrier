	<brief_summary>1 . Background：The method anti-snore ( treatment snore ) divide conservative , invasive minimal invasive treatment . IN brief , minimal invasive surgery involve radiofrequency pillar implant demonstrate significantly improvement snore without major complication . Previous study usually evaluate snore subjective measure visual analog scale visual analog scale . Rare report analyze snore sound instrumentally report demonstrate correlation subjective perception objective assessment snore surgical intervention . 2 . Purposes： 1 . Development snore sound spectrum . 2 . Exploration correlation subjective perception objective assessment snore . 3 . Comparison change snore minimal invasive surgery two kind MIS understand surgical impact subjective objective measurement . 3 . Method：We plan enroll 30 subject diagnose polysomnography simple snore mild OSA major complaint snore favorable anatomic structure minimal invasive surgery . All eligible subject instruct purpose , process relate right study sign inform consent outpatient clinic . Subjects start complete Snore Outcome Survey ( SOS , validate questionnaire ) visual analog sure snoring ( VAS ) . Objective overnight snore sound recode arranged sleep center . Subjects receive minimal invasive surgery：radiofrequency pillar implant soft palate randomization . Both radiofrequency pillar implant common technique treat snore performed local anesthesia outpatient procedure sit position . All subject receive repeat snore sound record completion SOS VAS three month MIS . 4 . Outcomes 1 . Development snore sound spectrum sleep-disorder breathing patient . 2 . Correlation parameter snore sound recording ( loudness , frequency , count , regularity , etc ) clinical parameter . 3 . Correlation objective ( snore sound analysis ) subjective ( SOS , VAS ) assessment snore . 4 . Comparison change snore ( particular objective assessment ) radiofrequency pillar implant . 5 . Comparison change snore radiofrequency pillar implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Snore Sound Following Minimal Invasive Surgery Sleep-disordered Breathing Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent publication demonstrate reduction snore several minimal invasive surgery ( MIS ) method soft palate include radiofrequency ( RF ) surgery pillar implant ( PI ) . Despite modest effect treatment obstructive sleep apnea , patient often wish receive MIS habitual snoring . However , efficacy reduce snore mainly determine self-reported questionnaire past . Further , definition surgical success snore treatment universally define . To date , change snore sound characteristic follow MIS demonstrate . Many cohort study randomize controlled trial clinical control trial compare MIS placebo , different energy generator , different material rigidity , different operative technique . RF soft palate produce volumetric tissue reduction selective scar tissue5 reduce obstruction induce stiffness . However , RF energy deliver soft palate inadequate may result residual recurrent snore . PI decrease palatal flutter increase rigidity soft palate implant identity tissue fibrosis . In addition , PI chronically retain muscle layer soft palate thereby produce long-term anti-snoring effect . Nevertheless , whether PI provide good efficacy treatment snore RF surgery still unknown . The primary aim current study compare anti-snoring effect PI RF subjective assessment randomize control parallel trial . The secondary aim explore compare acoustic change snore sound PI RF .</detailed_description>
