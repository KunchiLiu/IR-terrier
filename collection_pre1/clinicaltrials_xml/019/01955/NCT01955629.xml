	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : Study Part 1 : To determine recommend dose aflibercept , oxaliplatin capecitabine ( XELOX ) combination use Part 2 study . Study Part 2 : To assess percentage participant without progression disease 6 month start maintenance therapy aflibercept single-agent , follow first-line induction therapy XELOX aflibercept combination participant previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary Objective : Study Part 2 : Include evaluation progression free survival , overall survival , response treatment , overall safety ( induction maintenance therapy ) assessment aflibercept pharmacodynamics biomarkers parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The duration study participant include period screen 3 week , study drug administration every 3 week disease progression , unacceptable toxicity participant 's refusal study treatment , follow minimum 30-day follow-up last study treatment administration . After study treatment discontinuation participant followed-up death , participant 's refusal end study ( whichever come first ) . This trial conduct Europe , INN designation study molecule `` aflibercept '' term therefore use throughout synopsis . In US , US proper name `` ziv-aflibercept '' .</detailed_description>
