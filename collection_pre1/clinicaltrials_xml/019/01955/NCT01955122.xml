	<detailed_description>Patients schedule screening , surveillance diagnostic colonoscopy recruit study randomize one two group . Each enrol subject undergo two `` back-to-back '' procedure . Subjects Group A ( study group ) undergo Standard view colonoscopy follow immediately EndoRings™ colonoscopy . Subjects Group B ( control group ) undergo EndoRings™ colonoscopy follow immediately Standard view colonoscopy . Results two group analyze compare , primary outcome measure adenoma miss rate polyp miss rate . Secondary outcome measure include withdrawal time , total procedure time characteristic polyp detect , include size histological result . Subjects follow 24 hour 7-days telephone interview analysis unexpected adverse event . Clinical result analyze use various statistical measure significance . Multi-center study 126 patient . Up 126 treated patient ( 2 group 57 patient +6 drop-out patient ) enrol study .</detailed_description>
