	<detailed_description>As unclear autoimmune disorder , pathogenesis type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) remain elusive . Among method study disease pathophysiology , genetic approach valuable capability hypothesis-testing hypothesis-generating . Although geo-epidemiological study show relatively high prevalence T1D Caucasians Asians , whether genetic factor identify T1D Caucasians essential T1D Asians yet clarify . Although human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) genotype variant report associated T1D , odds ratio ( ORs ) relatively low Taiwan compare western country , family indeed one child T1D . However , genetic linkage study T1D still limit Taiwan hamper drug development research T1D . Therefore , intend explore susceptible gene T1D Taiwan study , provide researcher direction disease .</detailed_description>
