	<brief_summary>Fentanyl frequently use pain medication pediatric adult anesthesia . Although study consider breakdown oral , transmucosal intravenous fentanyl preparation child , disposition fentanyl pediatric patient sufficiently describe . This study aim show clearance fentanyl obese child adolescent increase compare child normal weight . Consequently , elimination half-life fentanyl different overweight obese child child normal body weight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity represent one important public health issue accord World Health Organization . It reach epidemic proportion globally , approximately 1.5 billion overweight adult 20 year old least 600 million clinically obese 2008 . According recent NHANES survey ( 2003-2006 ) , two-third adult US overweight obese ( overweight 68 % , half obese ) 17.6 % child adolescent age 12 19 consider overweight obese . Obesity also become important challenge anesthesiologist . Safety drug dose particularly within field pediatric anesthesia , paramount concern affect patient outcome . Data collect United Kingdom 100,000 anesthetize pediatric patient show critical incident twice likely occur obese child preoperative period obese adult . A possible explanation may link lack precision drug dose obese patient . Fentanyl frequently use opioid analgesic pediatric adult anesthesia . Fentanyl commonly administer pediatric patient undergo anesthesia high potency , rapid onset short duration action . Due property intravenously administer fentanyl well suit analgesic compound general anesthesia pediatric patient . The pharmacokinetics fentanyl adult well documented . Although study investigate pharmacokinetic property oral , transmucosal intravenous fentanyl preparation child , disposition fentanyl pediatric patient sufficiently describe . Several study infant child report age-dependent difference pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic parameter intravenously administer fentanyl . Currently data available pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics fentanyl adolescent obese patient .</detailed_description>
