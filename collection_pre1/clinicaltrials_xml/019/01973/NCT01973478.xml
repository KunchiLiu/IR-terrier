	<detailed_description>Because recurrent nature , prevalence consequence , major depressive disorder real public health issue term diagnosis treatment . Some form depression chronic resistant treatment ( TRD ) , either unipolar ( repeat episode depression ) bipolar ( repeat episode depression manic and/or hypomanic episode ) . In form suicide risk important . Patients TRD potential candidate neurosurgical intervention treat depression . The benefit neurosurgical procedure expect important patient . Psychosurgery intervention base upon lesion , however , show limitation relate 1/ large variability neurosurgical gesture , 2/ side effect , course 3/ irreversible damage cause surgery . Current brain imaging data yield fresh information pathophysiology depression suggest new therapeutic approach TRD . Modulation sub-caudate specific pathway , part orbitofrontal anterior cingulate cortico-subcortical loop allow diminution depressive symptom . The modulation specific pathway , initially targeted classical neurosurgery , could benefit current development functional neurosurgery . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) may represent opportunity patient suffer TRD . Our preliminary study base upon stimulation accumbens nucleus show encouraging result . The investigator thus plan randomize control trial versus sham stimulation confirm therapeutic value nucleus accumbens DBS .</detailed_description>
