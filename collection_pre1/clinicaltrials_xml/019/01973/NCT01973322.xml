	<detailed_description>Title : Vaccination autologous dendritic cell load autologous tumor lysate homogenate combine immunomodulating radiotherapy and/or preleukapheresis IFN-alfa patient metastatic melanoma : randomize `` proof-of-principle '' phase II study . Short Title/Acronym : ABSIDE ( ABScopal effect-Interferon alpha-DEndritic cell ) Protocol Code IRST172.02 Phase : phase II clinical trial Study Design : Randomized selection design , proof principle study Study Duration : 36 month Study Center ( ) : Monocentric ( IRCCS IRST Meldola ) Objectives : Primary objective 1 . Safety assessment : determine safety autologous tumor lysate load DC vaccine combination IFN-alfa and/or radiotherapy patient advance melanoma . 2 . Clinical objective : select regimen best immune related Disease Control Rate ( irDCR ) different external immunostimulant condition utilized combination autologous tumor lysate load DC vaccine . 3 . Immunological objective : compare different treatment arm immunologic efficacy , define proportion subject develop positive DTH ATL and/or KLH , combine quantification tumor antigen-specific circulating immune effector perform IFNalfa-ELISPOT analysis base line least 4 immunization , DTH analysis detect difference term immunologic efficacy different arm . Number Subjects : 24 evaluable patient Diagnosis Main Inclusion Criteria : Patients non resectable stage III stage IV malignant melanoma carry least 2 measurable lesion , line 1st line Vemurafenib patient carry BRAF mutation-positive melanoma and/or ≥ 2nd line Ipilimumab . Study Product , Dose , Route , Regimen duration administration : Intradermal Autologous Dendritic Cell vaccine load autologous tumor lysate homogenate week 1 , 4 6 8 induction phase , every 4 week maintenance phase maximum 14 vaccine dos ( dose follow IL-2 3 MU day 2-6 ) COMBINED OR NOT WITH - IFN-alfa 3 MU daily 7 day leukapheresis AND/OR - Three daily dose 8 Gy 12 Gy deliver one metastatic field vaccine dose 1 2 ( optional one additional field dose 7 8 ) utilize IMRT-IMAT technique . Statistical Methodology : The RANDOMIZED SELECTION DESIGN choose base assumption immunotherapy expect effective patient show efficient induction antitumor immune response ( `` target endpoint '' ) , allow reduce number patient require evaluate potential efficacy experimental treatment . The Steinberg Venzon approach employ select one among different treatment arm worthy evaluation . This method require adequate gap number response among different arm observe order limit probability select arm actually inferior indifferent amount . Assuming error probability select inferior arm pW =10 % , 6 patient per arm , regardless proportion irOR expect arm , gap 2 , large minimal difference number irOR must observe order select arm high number irOR , provide difference high probability response maximum remain arm 15 % . Therefore , outcome least 4/6 versus maximum remain 3 arm 2/6 , least 5/6 versus maximum remain 3 arm 3/6 forth lead selection promise arm basis irOR . error probability 10 % Otherwise treatment arm could consider good others .</detailed_description>
