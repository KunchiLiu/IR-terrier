	<brief_title>Study Icotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Esophageal Cancer After Failure Conventional Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , standard second-line therapy esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.More effective therapy patient disease develop disease progression first line therapy needed.Although Erlotinib recommend NCCN Guideline Version 2.2013 , still insufficient evidence EGFR-TKI second-line therapy esophageal squamous carcinoma.Therefore , research necessary.In phase II study , evaluate efficacy safety Icotinib Hydrochloride treatment patient recurrent metastasis esophageal squamous carcinoma failure conventional chemotherapy , analyse value biomarkers patient identify benefit .</detailed_description>
