	<brief_summary>The goal observational study evaluate toxicity local tumor control proton therapy patient head neck cancer previously irradiate field . Standard care recurrent secondary malignancy previously irradiate field surgery . For inoperable patient residual tumor surgery , standard care would palliative chemotherapy . For small subset patient ( good performance status , small radiation field ) re-irradiation perform . In study establish concept re-irradiation photon transfer proton radiotherapy . Proton therapy advantage steeper dose gradient normal tissue , thus-theoretical advantage low toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : Evaluation late toxicity re-irradiation proton , patient head neck cancer previously ( &gt; 50 Gy ) irradiate field . Secondary : Evaluation efficacy ( local control ) acute toxicity ( 24 Months ) re-irradiation proton dose 60 Gy , patient head neck cancer previously ( &gt; 50 Gy ) irradiate field . OUTLINE This single center observational study . In-house standard care patient ( good performance status small tumor ) head neck cancer previously ( &gt; 50 Gy ) irradiate field irradiate tumor hyperfractionated schedule concurrent cisplatin dose 66 Gy . Dose limit schedule incidence acute late toxicity induce radiation . The purpose study evaluation safety treatment schedule base use proton . Proton beam treatment deliver 2 Gy fraction , 5 day per week , total dose 60-66 Gy equivalent . Study visit perform : During proton therapy per week . Follow-up visit schedule every 3 month first 24 month proton therapy . Primary endpoint late toxicity 24 month proton treatment .</detailed_description>
