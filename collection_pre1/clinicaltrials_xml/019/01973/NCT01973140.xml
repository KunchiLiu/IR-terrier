	<brief_summary>Tolvaptan one new class medication approve treatment low blood sodium ( hyponatremia ) . It work interfere effect antidiuretic hormone , vasopressin , thereby increase urine output decrease body water . However , magnitude effect vary person person . Thus , efficacy tolvaptan less reliable infusion concentrate salt solution emergency , short term treatment hyponatremia . This study design test 3 hypothesis variable efficacy tolvaptan . 1 . The variable effect urine output due individual difference blood vasopressin counteracts effect tolvaptan . 2 . The difference blood vasopressin due individual difference amount secrete response rise blood sodium . 3 . The variable effect blood sodium due mainly variable effect urine output correct maintaining water intake urine output . The study 2 part perform 12 healthy adult male . 1 . Six subject receive tolvaptan dose 60 mg mouth six subject receive tolvaptan 30 mg mouth . Blood urine collect hourly 6 hour water ingest prescribed amount . For next 16 hour , subject drink blood urine collect 4 time . 2 . One week later , subject receive concentrate salt solution ( 3 % saline ) vein 6 hour . During time , blood urine collect hourly drink permit . For next 4 hour , subject allow drink blood urine collect twice . The volume , concentration creatinine content urine determine . Blood analyze sodium , vasopressin , first study , tolvaptan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects:12 healthy adult male , age 21-55 , recruited via poster medical center . They must pass screen history &amp; physical examination abstain ingestion grapefruit product 3 day prior study caffeinated beverage 24 hour study . Procedures : Each subject receive two different treatment one week apart . Each time , fast overnight , present Northwestern University Clinical Research Unit Northwestern Memorial Hospital 0700 hour give light breakfast . At 0900 hour , staff collect completely void urine ( U0 ) venous blood sample 20 mL ( B0 ) weigh subject near 0.1 kg , record vital sign ( pulse rate blood pressure ) , obtain thirst score ( rating 1 10 ) begin treatment . 1 . The treatment first admission tolvaptan . Six subject receive tolvaptan dose 60 mg mouth six subject receive tolvaptan 30 mg mouth . Hourly next 6 hour ( i.e . 1500 hour ) , measurement sample obtain baseline repeat . In addition , subject drink volume water 5 mL/kg body weight low volume urine void . This expected raise plasma sodium 7 millimoles/L 6 hour . For next 16 hour , subject remain allowed drink . In addition , serve dinner approximately 1700 hour measure obtain baseline repeat 1700 , 1900 , 2300 0700 hour subject discharge . 2 . On second admission one week later , procedure identical first admission follow exception : ( ) instead tolvaptan , 0900 hour , subject start infusion 3 % saline rate 0.033 mL/min/kg body weight . This infusion continue 6 hour ( i.e . 1500 hour ) expect raise plasma sodium 7 millimoles/L ) , tolvaptan treatment ; ( b ) volume blood remove time small ( 10 mL ) since assay tolvaptan ; ( c ) subject permitted drink infusion . In addition , subject remain unit 4 hour ( 1900 hour ) . During time , permit drink , serve dinner 1700 hour baseline measurement repeat 1700 1900 hour . The data collect two test obtain follow : 1. weight kg near 0.1 kg 2. thirst intensity rat subject scale 1 10 . 3. pulse blood pressure recumbent 4. urine volume near 5 mL 5. urine osmolarity freeze point depression Clinical Research Unit Core Laboratory 6. urine creatinine clinical chemistry laboratory Northwestern Memorial Hospital 7. blood place ice , centrifuge immediately 4 C , plasma remove : 1. osmolarity freeze point depression Clinical Research Unit Core Lab ( STAT ) 2. sodium ion specific electrode Northwestern Memorial Hospital chemistry laboratory seal storage 4 degree C 2-16 hour 3. vasopressin radioimmunoassay Clinical Research Unit Core Laboratory seal storage -4 C approximately 6 month 4. tolvaptan ( first study ) reverse phase , high performance liquid chromatography ICON Labs ( Dublin ) storage -20 C approximately 6 month . DATA analysis interpretation follow : 1 . To test hypothesis variable effect tolvaptan urine concentration flow depend level plasma vasopressin well plasma tolvaptan , relationship osmolarity first 9 urine collection treatment area curve ( AUC ) plasma vasopressin , plasma tolvaptan ratio plasma tolvaptan/plasma vasopressin concurrent time period determine regression analysis 12 subject . The analysis perform use urine volume instead urine osmolarity . Hypothesis 1 predicts subject , best correlation ( r value ) urine osmolarity ratio tolvaptan/vasopressin . It also predict slope every individual regression line negative ( i.e . high ratio tolvaptan vasopressin ) low urine osmolarity ) . However , slope may differ subject owe individual difference concentrate capacity kidney . 2 . To test hypothesis individual difference plasma vasopressin treatment due inherent , genetically determine difference secretory response osmotic ( sodium ) stimuli know exist human , relationship plasma vasopressin plasma sodium ( osmolarity ) first 6 hour treatment tolvaptan 3 % saline determine separately regression analysis compare . Based previous finding , correlation plasma vasopressin plasma sodium ( osmolarity ) high ( r &gt; 0.9 ) every subject 3 % saline infusion slope vary markedly subject . The hypothesis predict correlation mark difference slope differ tolvaptan treatment . This prediction test regress slope tolvaptan slope subject 3 % saline infusion 12 subject . If hypothesis correct , correlation coefficient individual slope great 0.8 line describe relation slope approximate 1 intercept near zero ax . 3 . To test hypothesis variable effect tolvaptan plasma sodium reduce continuously adjust fluid intake level urine output constant amount ( 5 mL/kg hour ) , relation plasma sodium elapse time 6 hour period tolvaptan saline infusion calculate separately subject regression analysis compare . If hypothesis correct , correlation coefficient tolvaptan saline treatment uniformly high e.g . great 0.9 subject even though slope line describe relationship may differ .</detailed_description>
