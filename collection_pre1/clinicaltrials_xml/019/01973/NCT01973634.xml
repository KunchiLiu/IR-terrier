	<brief_summary>Whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) breast conserve surgery early-stage breast cancer halve recurrence risk reduces breast cancer death one sixth . A sequential boost ( SeqB ) dose tumour bed improve local control , also increase risk late skin toxicity cosmetic change . At Ghent University Hospital WBI prescribe 15 fraction 2.67 Gy accord START-B hypofractionation scheme . A sequential boost typically give 4 8 extra fraction prolongs overall treatment time . The boost dose also deliver within 15 fraction WBI , so-called simultaneous integrate boost ( SIB ) . SIB shorten overall treatment time convenient patient radiotherapy department . In study wish test hypothesis acceptable skin toxicity reduce cost SIB use hypofractionated prone intensity modulation radiotherapy IMRT topographical dose painting , technique recently develop group . Patients randomize SeqB SIB .</brief_summary>
