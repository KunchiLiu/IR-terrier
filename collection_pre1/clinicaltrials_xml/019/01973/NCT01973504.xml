	<brief_summary>MP4OX develop ischemic rescue therapy perfuse oxygenate tissue risk hemorrhagic shock . MP4OX pegylated hemoglobin-based colloid design improve perfusion target delivery oxygen ischemic tissue . This study evaluate safety efficacy MP4OX treatment , addition standard therapy , trauma patient suffer lactic acidosis due severe hemorrhagic shock .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2c Dose Comparison Study MP4OX Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute trauma , include blunt penetrate injury , often associate uncontrolled bleeding lead hemorrhagic shock . During shock , inadequate blood flow result local ischemia tissue hypoxia ( insufficient oxygenation ) critical organ result lactic acidosis . More 10 % trauma victim reach hospital alive die , many suffer organ failure . The primary goal treat traumatic hemorrhage control blood loss , support ventilation oxygenation , maintain cardiovascular function maintain organ perfusion . Despite optimal care , organ dysfunction present many patient evidence persistent lactic acidosis . Blood transfusion intend improve circulation oxygen-carrying red blood cell , frequently insufficient , even hemoglobin level optimize . The severity lactic acidosis trauma victim also show correlate bad outcome . Support propose application MP4OX therapeutic adjunct standard treatment severe hemorrhage shock , base multiple preclinical study different animal model hemorrhagic shock resuscitation . These preclinical study demonstrate survival great restoration acid-base status hemodynamics improve MP4OX . The benefit MP4OX animal observe without co-administration autologous blood , demonstrate red cell transfusion alone insufficient , effect MP4OX additive . The hypothesis current study MP4OX enhance perfusion oxygenation ischemic organ thereby prevent reduce duration organ failure improve morbidity mortality outcome measure .</detailed_description>
