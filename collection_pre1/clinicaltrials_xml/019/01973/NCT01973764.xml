	<detailed_description>Background Puncture ventricular system one frequently perform neurosurgical intervention . This procedure perform order treat and/or measure pathologically elevate intracranial pressure . Therefore safe fast surgical procedure need . Currently `` landmark-based '' placement intraventricular catheter gold standard . Nonetheless know 60 % catheter place accurately perform `` landmark-based '' procedure . When catheter place accurately multiple puncture may do . Puncture ventricular system one frequently perform neurosurgical intervention . This procedure commonly perform order treat and/or measure pathologically elevate intracranial pressure . Therefore safe fast surgical procedure needed.Currently `` landmark-based '' placement intraventricular catheter gold standard . Nonetheless know 60 % catheter place accurately perform `` landmark-based '' procedure . When catheter place accurately multiple puncture may require . Incorrectly place intraventricular catheter may lead undesirable side effect like catheter dysfunction , case correction catheter position even new puncture require . These correction increase risk intracerebral hemorrhage , infection secondary brain injury . In study , investigator prospectively investigate whether ultrasound guidance increase number well-placed ventricular catheter reduces number undesirable side effect . In study correct catheter position define catheter tip locate lateral ventricle ( ipsilateral burrhole ) anterior foramen Monro . Catheter tip position assess cranial computer tomography operation . The CT scan evaluate independent expert rater , blind procedure type . These incorrectly place intraventricular catheter may lead undesirable side effect , like catheter dysfunction wherefore correction catheter position even new puncture do . These correction increase risk intracerebral hemorrhage , infection secondary brain damage . In study , investigator prospectively investigate ultrasound guidance may raise number well place ventricular catheter may reduce number undesirable side effect . In study correct catheter position define catheter tip locate ipsilateral lateral ventricle ( burrhole ) anterior foramen monroi assess cranial computer tomography operation . The CT Scans evaluate independent expert rater , blind procedure type . Objective Aim study investigate whether ultrasound guidance ventricular catheter placement lead low number incorrectly place catheter low number puncture compare landmark-based procedure . Methods This study prospective randomize control clinical trial . A total 90 patient include study randomize two group 45 patient ( ultrasound-guided group landmark-based group ) . The position ventricular catheter assess use cranial computer tomography ( CCT ) . The CT Scans evaluate two independent expert raters , blind procedure type .</detailed_description>
