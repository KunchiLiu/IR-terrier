	<brief_summary>Pleural effusion extremely common problem multiple cause ; subsequent investigation thoracocentesis treatment drainage represent two frequently perform diagnostic therapeutic medical procedure . The role thoracic ultrasonography management pleural effusion modern rapidly expand one , become effectively mandatory part `` gold standard '' past decade due diagnostic patient safety benefit . By contrast , measurement intra-pleural pressure use sequential manometry fail convincingly demonstrate clinical value beyond physiological study despite availability century . Previous work show potential role pleural manometry predict presence un-expandable lung success talc pleurodesis study replicate clinically validate . We intend combine old new observational study compare finding thoracic ultrasonography pleural manometry thoracocentesis patient-reported symptom key clinical outcome presence un-expandable lung success talc pleurodesis . The investigator hypothesise previously describe variation pleural elastance correlate appearance anatomical change visualise thoracic ultrasonography ; combination reliably utilised predict clinical outcome . The study may allow proposal treatment algorithm allow patient pleural effusion manage expeditious efficient manner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study-specific intervention monitor intrapleural pressure use electronic pleural manometer ( Mirador Biomedical CompassTM Thoracentesis Assist Device ) thoracic ultrasonography . Both consider non-invasive low-risk study participant . As part standard usual clinical care , participant undergo diagnostic and/or therapeutic pleural intervention form thoracocentesis pleural aspiration ; intercostal chest drain insertion ; and/or talc pleurodesis . All procedure invasive associate potential complication participant inform part standard inform consent procedure . These intervention however clinically indicate carry whether individual chooses participate study . For individual participate study , complication standard clinical care procedure record part data collection process study .</detailed_description>
