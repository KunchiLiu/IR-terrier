	<brief_title>Effects Roflumilast Hospitalized Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Mortality Re-hospitalization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) currently afflict 24 million US resident 3th lead cause death United States . Each year , 150,000 patient die COPD U.S. one patient every 4 minute . Health care cost COPD patient US approximately $ 6.5 billion/ year , indirect cost probably double cost care take account lose productivity caretaker expense . COPD exacerbation add considerably burden : ( 1 ) cause frequent hospital admission relapse readmission , ( 2 ) contribute directly death many patient , either hospitalization shortly thereafter , ( 3 ) cause patient significant stress , prolong physical discomfort , disability dramatically reduce quality life , ( 4 ) consume majority resource available manage chronic condition , ( 5 ) frequently progress severe stage warrant hospitalization abortive treatment institute , ( 6 ) may hasten progressive loss lung function , steady decline cardinal feature COPD . Hospitalized exacerbation particularly relevant COPD patient . Hospitalized exacerbation result profound impact patient survival , function , symptoms health status well cost Hospitalizations account significant component COPD related cost . Re-hospitalization COPD frequent associate particularly negative impact . Patients discharge hospital COPD exacerbation high mortality frequently readmitted recurrent exacerbation . The cause high rate readmission well understood . Although number pharmacologic behavioral intervention use decrease exacerbation COPD , clear intervention successful reduce hospital admission rate re-admission rate . Except use noninvasive ventilation patient present acute respiratory failure COPD hospitalization , new therapy discover last 3 decade . Hence , investigations new therapy treat COPD patient hospitalize severe exacerbation desperately need . A .

The specific aim : 1 . Determine tolerance roflumilast hospitalize COPD patient 2 . Determine treatment effect roflumilast add-on therapy decrease cause readmission mortality composite endpoint 180 day randomization roflumilast match placebo ≤ 12 hour hospitalization acute COPD exacerbation . 4 . R. Statistical analysis plan . The primary analysis study outcome perform intention treat basis . In intention treat approach , subject analyze group randomize , regardless whether assign treatment adhere regardless whether eligibility violation . 1 . Analysis baseline characteristic . Univariate descriptive statistic calculate baseline parameter overall treatment group . For categorical outcome , include number percentage subject category . For continuous variable , include mean standard deviation variable approximately normal distribution median 25th 75 % percentile variable skew distribution . 2 . Analysis primary endpoint . The primary outcome time randomization composite outcome cause re-hospitalization all-cause mortality , whichever come first . The primary analysis log-ranked test associate Kaplan-Meier plot , unadjusted covariates . Censoring occur early date follow occurrence , unless subject already experienced primary outcome event : - Lost follow-up despite intensive effort - Subject healthcare proxy withdrawal consent - 180 day randomization . 3 . Analysis secondary outcome . Primary analysis time event outcome perform use unadjusted log rank test associate Kaplan-Meier plot , similar primary analysis primary study outcome . Secondary analysis outcome use Cox regression adjust baseline subject factor ( covariates ) know associated outcome . The primary analysis change continuous measure absolute percent change spirometry dyspnea score , example , analyze use analysis covariance change baseline particular time period dependent variable . 4 . Assessment treatment effect In pilot proposal , treatment effect roflumilast vs. placebo prolong time event combine endpoint death re-hospitalization assessed intention treat manner . In similar manner , treatment effect roflumilast vs. placebo effect secondary endpoint propose measured pivotal phase III trial also measure ( time respiratory death respiratory re-hospitalization 180 day post-randomization ; rate death readmission 30 day post-discharge ; treatment failure [ see definition ] ; change health status , change FEV1 , dyspnea 180 day post-randomization ; length hospital stay index hospitalization ; tolerance roflumilast vs. placebo hospitalize AECOPD ) . Because pilot study intent see signal would justify large clinical trial . Therefore significance level set 0.1 power set 0.7 . A total 100 patient enter two treatment parallel-design study . The probability 70 percent study detect treatment difference two side 10.0 percent significance level , true hazard ratio 1.654 . This base assumption accrual period 36 month follow period 6 month median time event 8 month . The total number event 73 .</detailed_description>
