	<detailed_description>PAMELA non-randomized , open label , multicentric translational research study neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade therapy without chemotherapy . Although efficacy safety investigate , primary goal identify profile predictive clinical benefit target therapy . Eligible patient must woman untreated primary HER2-overexpressing and/or amplify breast tumor 1 cm diameter amenable definitive surgery ( stage I-IIIA ) . The PAMELA study design test hypothesis PAM50 HER2-E subtype able predict clinical response neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade lapatinib trastuzumab , without endocrine therapy , assess pathological complete response breast ( pCRB ) rate time surgery , compare traditional clinical HER2 classification . Furthermore , posit characterization gene expression pattern may identify profile may safely spar chemotherapy . Patients first undergo screening , tumor measurement , mandatory collection core tumor biopsies central determination HER2 HR status . These biopsy use determine gene expression pattern patient include study . Patients treat dual HER2 blockade consist lapatinib trastuzumab total 18 week . Patients HR-positive also give endocrine therapy , letrozole tamoxifen depend menopausal status , 18 week . If tumor progression observe ultrasound ( US ) week 6 , tumor identify resistant , paclitaxel add dual HER2 blockade , maintain trastuzumab original dose reduce lapatinib dose safety reason . In patient HR-positive disease , endocrine therapy withdrawn order avoid adverse interaction chemotherapy . Two week first administration study medication , patient undergo mandatory repeat tumor tissue acquisition use secondary endpoint assessment . Post treatment tissue acquisition obtain time surgery specimen excise . US breast axillary lymph node perform baseline , Day 14 , week 6 , prior surgery , correlate pCR . If tumor progression observe week 6 , US repeat week 10 discard progression continue despite addition paclitaxel neoadjuvant regimen . Mammography required baseline prior surgery , use objective response assessment . Treatment give definitive surgery , clinical sign disease progression paclitaxel addition , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal patient consent . Breast surgery carry 1 3 week completion dual HER2 blockade without endocrine therapy , 2 3 week completion paclitaxel plus dual HER2 blockade , initiate progressive disease . Following surgical excision , adjuvant treatment per investigator´s choice local standard care outside scope protocol . End study 30 day ( ±14 day ) surgery safety follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
