	<brief_summary>A periprosthetic distal femur fracture fracture close knee implant . This type fracture often difficult fix close proximity two surgical implant sometimes interfere proper bone healing . Improper healing cause significant impairment sometimes require additional surgery correct problem . Despite considerable interest research put develop technique repair fracture surgeon know best way treat type fracture . Our multicentre orthopaedic study group conduct study compare two standard , different treatment periprosthetic distal femur fracture . One treatment consist open surgery placement plate screw along side femur . The consists implant intramedullary nail femur . The goal study directly compare two treatment see one treatment result well patient outcome .</brief_summary>
