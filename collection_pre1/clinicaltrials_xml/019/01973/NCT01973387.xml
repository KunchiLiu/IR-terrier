	<brief_title>A Study PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) Versus Rituximab Relapsed Refractory Chronic Leukemia/Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( individual assign study treatment chance ) , open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study design evaluate efficacy safety ibrutinib versus rituximab adult Asia Pacific region patient relapsed/refractory CLL SLL active disease require treatment fail least 1 prior line therapy consider appropriate candidate treatment retreatment purine analog-based therapy . Approximately 150 patient randomly assign 1:2 ratio 2 treatment arm receive either intravenous rituximab ( Treatment Arm A ) 6 cycle oral ibrutinib ( Treatment Arm B ) disease progression unacceptable toxicity , whichever occur first . The study include screen , treatment , follow-up phase . Treatment extend randomization study drug discontinuation . Follow-up consist 2 phase : post-treatment ( discontinuation treatment reason disease progression patient progressive disease ) post-disease progression ( subsequent anticancer therapy survival status record death , lose follow-up , consent withdrawal , study closure ) . Patients rituximab arm disease progression meet International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( IWCLL ) criteria require subsequent anti-CLL therapy may consider cross receive ibrutinib 420 mg orally , daily disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal study , study end whichever occur early . Efficacy evaluations assess disease response progression accordance International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criterion . Serial pharmacokinetic ( study drug body ) blood sample collect ibrutinib treatment group . Safety assess throughout study .</detailed_description>
