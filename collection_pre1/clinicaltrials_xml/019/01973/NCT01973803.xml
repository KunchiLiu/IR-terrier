	<brief_summary>This study evaluate performance Articulinx ICMC ( InterCarpoMetacarpalCushion ) carpometacarpal joint ( CMC joint ) describe clinical result patient treated device . Expected result include relief symptom improvement function patient symptomatic osteoarthritis ( OA ) CMC-1 joint . Evaluation device performance achieve measurement pain , pain medication use , joint function 40 subject . Each subject compare pre-surgery status endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Articulinx InterCarpoMetacarpal Cushion ( ICMC ) Osteoarthritis First Metacarpal Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Articulinx ICMC intend implanted basilar , first carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint , interpositional spacer first metacarpal trapezium bone . The device intend use treatment thumb disability result osteoarthritis CMC‐1 joint . The primary objective document performance Articulinx ICMC evaluate pain relief CMC joint follow device implantation . CMC-1 joint function assess measurement lateral key tripod pinch strength , grip strength , range motion . Patient report physical functioning symptom measure DASH score . Trapezial height measure standard PA xrays CMC joint . Incidence unanticipated device procedure related adverse event document intraoperatively one year follow-up . Primary secondary outcome evaluate one year subject continue follow two year evaluation long term performance .</detailed_description>
