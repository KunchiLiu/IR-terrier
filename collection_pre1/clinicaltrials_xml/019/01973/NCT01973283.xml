	<brief_summary>The goal open-administration treatment study citalopram ( duloxetine ) evaluate effect antidepressant medication treat syndrome `` frailty '' old adult depressive symptom . Patients significant depressive symptom ( define CES-D ( Center Epidemiological Studies - Depression scale ) &gt; 10 ) 1 symptom frailty syndrome ( exhaustion , decrease energy , weight loss , decrease grip strength , slow/unsteady gait ) evaluate treated citalopram ( duloxetine ) 8 week test whether antidepressant medication improve syndrome frailty depressive symptom . Patients evaluate Adult Late Life Depression clinic eligible participate study treat antidepressant medication assess primary outcome variable ( characteristic frailty , depressive symptom ) well secondary variable include cognition ( global cognition , episodic memory , executive function ) , function ( physical mobility , instrumental activity daily live , social functioning ) prior treatment initiation follow 8-weeks treatment . The hypothesis protocol predict discover significant improvement frailty characteristic depressive symptom clinical population treat antidepressant medication ( citalopram duloxetine ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Frailty , `` syndrome decreased resiliency reserve '' , define five characteristic : 1 ) '' shrink '' ( definition : unintentional weight loss &gt; 10 lb prior year , &gt; 5 % loss body weight prior year follow-up ) , 2 ) weakness ( definition : grip strength low 20 % baseline , adjust gender BMI ) , 3 ) poor endurance/energy ( definition : self-report exhaustion 2 item CES-D ) , 4 ) slowness ( definition : slow 20 % time 4 meter 15 foot walk , adjust gender stand height ) , 5 ) low physical activity ( definition : weight score kilocalorie expend per week calculate Minnesota Leisure Time Activity questionnaire ) . Frailty associate poor prognosis include hospitalization , fall , worsen disability mobility , death . Data Cardiovascular Health Study document rate comorbid depressive symptom frail old adult ( 16.2 % old adult least 1 frailty characteristic CES-D &gt; 10 , include 31 % old adult 3 frailty characteristic , compare 2.6 % nonfrail old adult ) despite study exclusion individual take antidepressant ( part choose include patient CES-D &gt; 10 , rather require diagnosis depressive disorder major depression dysthymia study ) . The relationship frailty depression however go beyond association ; five define characteristic frailty ( exhaustion , decrease energy , weight loss , decrease grip strength , slow/unsteady gait ) overlap significantly symptom geriatric depression ( decreased energy motivation , psychomotor slowing , weight loss , decrease participation leisure activity ) . The propose study innovative focus group old adult unrepresented ( via exclusion criterion ) previous clinical study ( frail older adult comorbid depressive symptom ) , treat comorbid depressive symptom target characteristics frailty syndrome hope alter prognostic trajectory clinical sample . This protocol serve two purpose : 1 . It test feasibility recruit retain frail old adult depressive symptom treatment trial , 2 . It provide pilot data effectiveness antidepressant medication treat characteristic frailty comorbid depressive symptom .</detailed_description>
