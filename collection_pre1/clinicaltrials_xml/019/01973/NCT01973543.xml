	<brief_title>AADC Gene Therapy Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease neurodegenerative disorder involve loss neuron release dopamine striatum . To compensate loss dopamine , patient typically prescribed levodopa medication convert dopamine enzyme Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase ( AADC ) . As Parkinson 's disease progress , levodopa therapy become less effective associate motor fluctuation , involuntary movement complication . This study primarily investigate safety increase AADC level striatum via AADC gene delivery . The hAADC gene package gene transfer vector derive common , non-pathogenic virus ( AAV2 ) &gt; 90 % human expose . This investigational drug , term VY-AADC01 , inject directly striatum neurosurgical procedure perform real-time MRI image monitor delivery . Subjects continue take Parkinson 's disease medication , include levodopa . The safety potential clinical response VY-AADC01 assess repeat clinical evaluation Parkinson 's disease , cognitive test , laboratory blood test neuroimaging . Clinical evaluation perform 3 year follow-up period . A test specifically assess clinical response levodopa perform AADC gene delivery approximately 6 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson 's disease Disease duration least 5 year Adequate duration levodopa therapy Modified Hoehn Yahr Staging least 2.5 OFF state Candidate surgical intervention disable motor complication . UPDRS Part III ( total motor ) score ≥ 25 maximum 60 OFF state . Unequivocal responsiveness dopaminergic therapy . Stable Parkinson 's symptom medication regimen least 4 week prior screen examination . Ability comprehend sign inform consent . Normal Laboratory value prior surgery . Neutralizing AAV2 antibody titer ≤ 1:1200 Ability travel study visit alone able designate caregiver . Subject agree defer neurological surgery , include deep brain stimulation , complete 12 month study visit ( unless recommend study neurologist ) . Subject agree participate therapeutic intervention study 12 month surgery . Subject agree vaccination within 30 day surgery . Atypical secondary parkinsonism , include limited symptom believe due trauma , brain tumor , infection , cerebrovascular disease , neurological disease , drug , chemical toxin . Presence dementia define Mattis Dementia Rating ScaleSecond Edition ( MDRS2 ) less 130 screening . Presence history psychosis , exception mild , benign hallucination believe judgment investigator relate Parkinson 's medication . Presence severe depression measure Beck Depression Inventory II ( BDIII ) &gt; 28 history major affective disorder within 5 year screen examination . Current suicidal ideation suicide attempt within 5 year screen examination . History substance abuse within 2 year screen examination . Brain imaging abnormality striatum region would substantially increase risk surgery . Contraindication MRI and/or gadoteridol . Coagulopathy inability temporarily stop anticoagulation antiplatelet prior surgery . Prior brain surgery include deep brain stimulation , infusion therapy brain surgery . Prior gene transfer . History stroke , poorly control significant cardiovascular disease , diabetes acute chronic medical condition . History malignancy treat carcinoma situ within three year screen evaluation . Clinically apparent laboratorydetected infection . Prior current treatment investigational agent within 2 month screen evaluation . Chronic immunosuppressive therapy , include chronic steroid , immunotherapy , cytotoxic therapy chemotherapy . Pregnant lactating woman . Subject reproductive capacity unwilling use barrier contraception . Any medical condition likely lead disability course study interfere confound study assessment Any factor , medical , social , would likely cause subject unable follow study protocol , include geographical inaccessibility . Ongoing treatment , neuroleptic medication , apomorphine , levodopa infusion therapy ( Duodopa® ) .</criteria>
