	<brief_summary>The purpose SQUEEZE Trial determine fluid resuscitation strategy result best outcomes child treat suspect confirmed septic shock . In study , eligible child randomize either 'Usual Care Arm ' 'Fluid Sparing Arm ' . Children receive treatment accord current ACCM Septic Shock Resuscitation Guidelines , assign resuscitation strategy use guide administration fluid boluses well timing initiation escalation vasoactive medication achieve ACCM recommend hemodynamic target .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current pediatric survive sepsis guideline American College Critical Care Medicine ( ACCM ) emphasize early goal-directed approach resuscitation . These guideline suggest fluid resuscitation aggressive repeat intravenous ( IV ) fluid boluses 20 mL/kg , child may require much 200 mL/kg fluid achieve therapeutic endpoint . The guideline also recommend initiation vasoactive agent stage `` fluid refractory shock '' , i.e . persistent hypoperfusion despite least 60 ml/kg IV fluid . Improvements pediatric septic shock survival attribute adherence first iteration ACCM septic shock guideline , use goal direct target . However , large publicize pediatric trial fluid resuscitation child suspect septic shock ( FEAST Trial ) , publish NEJM 2011 , demonstrate increased mortality among child treat aggressive fluid resuscitation comparison conservative fluid resuscitation arm . As result , pediatric critical care community clearly acknowledge result , important , necessarily generalizable developed country Canada . Emerging publication ICU literature suggest excessive compare conservative fluid administration adult septic shock worsens outcomes duration mechanical ventilation , complication relate third-spacing fluid , length ICU stay , mortality . A systematic review publish August 2012 reveals paucity randomize control trial ( RCT ) evidence apart FEAST trial examine impact fluid resuscitation mortality child septic shock . This raise important question whether child developed country would also benefit fluid spar resuscitation strategy achieve ACCM goal-directed target . Use fluid spar strategy would , default , require early initiation preferential escalation vasoactive medication meet ACCM hemodynamic goal . The optimal degree fluid resuscitation time initiation vasoactive support order achieve therapeutic target child septic shock remain unanswered . This Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial constitutes first step answer research question whether , pediatric patient septic shock , use fluid spar strategy achieve ACCM therapeutic goal , result improve clinical outcome without increase risk adverse event , compare usual care aggressive fluid resuscitation currently recommend ACCM guideline . The purpose pilot study determine feasibility inform appropriate methodological design large multi-centre RCT fully answer research question . The hypothesis pilot study SQUEEZE Trial feasible conduct .</detailed_description>
