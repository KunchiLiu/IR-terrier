	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veteran 's Healthcare : Weight management important focus VA evidence VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline MOVE ! program target overweight/obesity . VA also commit use group visit increase efficiency effectiveness health care delivery . The investigator aim test novel intervention combine intensive weight diabetes management use SMA platform . This research address important mission VA diabetes prevalent Veterans general population , weight management challenge complex patient diabetes . Project Background : SMAs involve group patient share common chronic condition meet time receive education , self-management enhancement , medication management improve clinical outcome . A systematic review VA find SMAs modestly improve glycemia patient diabetes . Although SMA program sometimes include diet physical activity counseling , weight management primary goal , weight typically reduce . Instead , medication intensification primary strategy improve glycemia , strategy lead weight gain . For overweight patient diabetes , weight loss first-line therapy improve glycemic control excess weight lead poor outcome . Moreover , many antiglycemic medication cause weight gain hypoglycemic event , may counteract potential macrovascular benefit glycemic control . Dietary intervention , however , low weight improve glycemic control reduce antiglycemic medication need , therefore , subsequent risk hypoglycemic episode . In prior research , investigator induce weight loss improve glycemic control decrease antiglycemic medication . A combination intensive weight management program diabetes management offer SMAs potential improve diabetes outcomes , reduce complication , decrease cost increase health-related quality life . Such combined intervention ideal patient diabetes unique dietary consideration , need careful glycemic medication management weight loss . Project Objectives : The investigator examine whether intensive , group-based weight management program follow SMA intervention ( WM/SMA arm ) comparably effective ( non-inferior ) SMA intervention alone improve glycemic control use less antiglycemic medication result few hypoglycemic event low healthcare cost . Project Methods : 308 overweight VA outpatient uncontrolled ( hemoglobin A1c 8.0 % 7.5 % great 50 ) type 2 diabetes participate RCT . Similar prior SMAs , SMA visit occur every 4 week 16 week every 8 week 32 week total 9 visit . Sessions lead physician trained interventionists , include educational topic relate diabetes management ( include diet physical activity ) , self-management training , medication adjustment . Similar investigator ' prior weight management trial , WM/SMA group meet every 2 week 16 week every 8 week 32 week total 13 visit . The weight management program focus low carbohydrate dietary pattern potential low glycemia , lead reduce antiglycemic medication need . After 16 week , meet content shift SMA intervention content weight management continue address meeting . The primary outcome glycemic control assess hemoglobin A1c assess baseline 16 , 32 , 48 week . Secondary outcome include hypoglycemic event , change antiglycemic medication regimen assess summary score , weight healthcare cost . Diabetes-specific health-related quality life medication adherence also assess .</detailed_description>
