	<detailed_description>Vascular cognitive impairment due vascular disease stroke frequently include problem attention , work memory executive function ( e.g. , monitoring , planning , organization ) . These deficit common - 32-73 % , chronic , interfere patient response rehabilitation , independence activity daily live , community re-integration , overall quality life stroke . Attention , memory executive function impairment adversely affect ability relearn various skill . Cognitive impairment impact component function impact individual , also adversely affect family via increase caregiver distress burden . Thus , presence cognitive impairment wide-reaching impact deserves effective consistent intervention similar attention devote improve function physical domain . Cognitive training improve cognitive function , particularly area know involved vascular cognitive impairment , i.e. , attentional executive function . Accumulating evidence indicate computer-based training improve cognitive skill healthy old adult well clinical population . Attention work memory training also show effective patient chronic phase post stroke . The investigator propose specific cognitive training improve work memory could provide direct benefit chronic stroke patient . Promising intervention focus intensive direct work memory train emerge show generalize cognitive domain , fluid intelligence .</detailed_description>
