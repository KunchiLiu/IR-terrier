	<brief_title>Study Paced QRS Duration Marker Sudden Cardiac Death</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Methods Procedures Subjects study enrol ICD clinic Pocono Medical Center . The ICD clinic Pocono Medical Center locate cardiology office 2.4 mile main hospital building patient undergo interrogation ICD direction principal investigator . During routine ICD interrogation , patient attach 3 lead surface ECG . The ICD check assess sense pace parameter impedance lead cardiac chamber . Battery voltage assess , store event include data appropriate inappropriate therapy , examine . Appropriate therapy consist either ICD shock anti-tachycardia pace ventricular tachyarrhythmias . Inappropriate therapy consist either ICD shock anti-tachycardia pace event ventricular tachyarrhythmias , may trigger supraventricular tachyarrhythmias electronic noise . Once subject enrol study , 12-lead ECG perform ( instead 3 lead ECG ) ICD interrogation ( baseline ECG ) . A 12 lead ECG repeat perform right ventricular pace programmer 100 beat per minute time pace threshold testing ( paced ECG ) . QRS duration baseline pace ECG measure electronically lead V3-V6 . The measured QRS complex precede atrial ventricular premature complex . All subject continue follow every three month ICD clinic routine ICD interrogation clinically indicate duration study . Data appropriate inappropriate ICD therapies retrieve documented case report form . Subjects consider suffer SCD meet one follow criterion . - An appropriate ICD therapy ( shock anti-tachycardia pacing ) - Death occur within one hour onset cardiac symptom - Death sleep - Unwitnessed death formerly stable patient - Death attempted resuscitation Data regarding mortality obtain patient 's family , family physician hospital record . - Project Plan Based current patient volume ICD clinic , rate new ICD implant , estimate enrol 250 patient take 3 year . The study conclude last enrolled patient follow 2 year . The follow-up period , therefore , 2-5 year patient enrol study . The total study duration therefore expect 5 year . - Data Analysis Data Monitoring At enrollment subsequent visit , follow data collect . - Demographic data : age , gender racial ethnic origin , height , weight vital sign include heart rate blood pressure - Co-morbid condition : coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , dyslipidemia , family history sudden cardiac death first degree relative , renal failure , others - Medical regimen : medication take time visit - Testing Cardiac substrate : report recent 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiography , echocardiogram , stress test , multigated acquisition scan , , cardiac catheterization revascularization , coronary artery bypass surgery , electrophysiological evaluation - Details ICD implantation : indication ICD implantation ( primary versus secondary prevention ) , type ICD implant ( single chamber , dual chamber biventricular ) well manufacturer , position right ventricular lead ( apical versus septal ) - Prolonged paced QRS duration define ≥150 m , narrow pace QRS duration define &lt; 150 ms. All baseline characteristic patient population express percentage . Relative risk SCD prolong pace QRS duration determine . Kaplan-Meier analysis do use end-point appropriate ICD therapy use surrogate marker SCD , clinical SCD generate survival curve subgroup .</detailed_description>
