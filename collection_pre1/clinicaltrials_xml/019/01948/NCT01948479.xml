	<brief_summary>Insoles design reduce increase loads re-ulceration risk patient diabetes . The investigator previous research finding suggest instant insole solution may benefit , effectiveness difficult predict . The investigator propose feasibility study use in-shoe pressure analysis optimise protective effect insole footwear aim reduce re-ulceration rate . Early indication exploratory case study within real world clinical set suggest implement investigator previous publish research finding investigator optimise effectiveness reduce outcome variability protective footwear insole provide patient risk re-ulceration . However randomise control trial necessary evaluate effectiveness in-shoe pressure analysis reduce re-ulceration rate within NHS set . The propose feasibility study recruit 20 participant multidisaplinary diabetic foot clinic Derriford Hospital allocate either 1 ) Routine insole footwear provision 2 ) Routine insole footwear provision , temporary insole provision optimisation . The finding feasibility study inform protocol development large clinical trial . The result feasibility study use strengthen protocol grant application conduct main RCT . A secondary output pilot study dissemination finding peer review journal conference .</brief_summary>
