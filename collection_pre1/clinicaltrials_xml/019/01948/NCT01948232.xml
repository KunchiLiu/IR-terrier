	<brief_title>Pilot Study Perindopril Childhood Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anthracycline cardiotoxicity characterize ventricular remodel progressive cardiac dysfunction . Since ventricular remodel type heart failure treat effectively angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) , agent would appear logical therapy child anthracycline-induced heart failure . Previous experience ACEi childhood cancer survivor show mixed result , possibly due fact treatment initiate late natural history disease . Providing treatment childhood cancer survivor early sign cardiac remodel may effective treat child global dysfunction . The benefit early intervention unclear , unclear whether CCS parent willing receive treatment target outcome ( prevention decrease global function congestive heart failure ) may occur year intervention . Assessing feasibility pre-emptive approach primary aim study .</detailed_description>
