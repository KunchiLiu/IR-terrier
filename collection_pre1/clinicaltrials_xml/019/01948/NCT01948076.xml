	<brief_summary>The 40 resident study subject randomize either receive training session use pocket-sized ultrasound receive training physical exam skill . Following session subject opportunity practice skill clinical round BWH inpatient outpatient setting . Four week train session study subject take part assessment diagnostic skill . During assessment ask complete exam patient subject . Those randomized ultrasound group allow use device control group use traditional physical exam . Following exam , resident study subject ask indicate whether detect follow abnormality exam : pleural effusion , hepatomegaly , cirrhotic liver , splenomegaly , ascites , aortic stenosis , mitral regurgitation , right atrial pressure , abdominal aortic aneurysm , deep vein thrombosis . Resident study subject also complete questionnaire physical exam use ultrasound . Prior assessment , patient undergo ultrasound attend radiologist , result serve `` gold standard '' study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>II . Specific Aims : Study population : Internal medicine resident academic center Patient population : A broad population patient diverse clinical condition include cardiac vascular disease , malignancy , rheumatologic disease , liver disease , renal failure , others . This population reflect diversity patient see internal medicine resident train . Physical finding study : 1 . Abdominal : hepatomegaly , cirrhotic liver , splenomegaly , ascites , abdominal aortic aneurysm 2 . Lungs : pleural effusion , pneumothorax , paralyzed hemidiaphragm . 3 . Cardiac : pericardial effusion , mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , aortic insufficiency , aortic stenosis , right atrial pressure . Primary Aim : Determine diagnostic accuracy resident use pocket-sized ultrasound device compare resident use traditional physical exam technique physical finding mention . Secondary Aims : - Determine whether medicine resident improve physical exam diagnostic skill receive train pocket-sized ultrasound device . - Determine additional diagnostic benefit pocket-sized ultrasound versus traditional physical exam . - Assess diagnostic physical exam skill medicine resident compare expert diagnostician . - Assess diagnostic ultrasound skill medicine resident compare trained radiologist use pocket-sized ultrasound . - Assess degree agreement expert physical diagnostician trained radiologist use pocket-sized ultrasound . - Evaluate ability resident integrate ultrasound examination daily patient care routine III . Subject Selection : Inclusion Criteria : All intern resident BWH internal medicine residency program respond recruitment email agree participate . Exclusion Criteria : - Radiology Preliminary resident - Residents previous formalize ultrasound training include practical component Resident Recruitment Methods : All intern resident BWH internal medicine residency program invite participate study . The study advertise via email announcement residency educational conference . Because Dr. Katz Dr. Yialamas part BWH residency leadership , participate recruitment resident avoid potential undue pressure participate . Patient Recruitment Methods : Advertisements send select faculty within department medicine radiology detail patient involvement select physical finding study . Patients ask treat physician radiologist involve care contact study coordinator . The coordinator assess interest availability . Patients consent agree participate . Fourteen patient-subjects ultimately select participate assessment program . They compensate $ 350 participate . IV . Subject Enrollment Forty resident respond email advertisement randomly select enrol . Each resident enrol consented one investigator prior participate study . The verbal consent process assure subject study data result appear residency record , use way residency program . They therefore remain wholly within purview investigation staff , form part residency evaluation . Each forty resident participate study receive compensation $ 150 time . V. Study Procedures Randomization Curricular Training The 40 participate resident randomize either control intervention group blindly pick small piece paper number paper bag . All resident participate 2 hour physical exam education session lead senior internal medicine faculty . Those randomized ultrasound group also attend 2 hour pocket-ultrasound training session run BWH faculty radiologist BWH faculty echocardiographer . Following training session , 20 resident give pocket-sized ultrasound device able use adjunct physical exam clinic inpatient ward . Because resident physician train ultrasound radiologist , ultrasound study informal result become part patient 's medical record . Participants control arm study receive pocket-sized ultrasound device receive training use machine . Physical Exam Assessment Session Four week randomization , 40 resident subject attend half-day physical exam assessment . This assessment take place Brigham Circle Medical Associates Clinic Third Floor BWH Shapiro Cardiovascular Building . The assessment also include participation 14 patient subject recruit ahead time . At start day , 14 patient subject examine two senior internal medicine clinician determine presence physical exam finding study . Each patient subject also undergo ultrasound evaluation two BWH radiologist echocardiographers radiographically confirm presence abovementioned physical finding . The `` gold standard '' study clinically detectable physical finding ( confirm senior clinician ) also confirm ultrasound study perform radiologist echocardiographer . Patient study subject assign clinic room study subject rotate 14 room course half-day session . Each interaction last 5 minute consist focused physical examination patient . All 40 medicine resident perform routine physical exam patient document finding . The 20 resident intervention group also perform exam patient use pocket-sized ultrasound document finding . Following assessment , study subject randomize control group opportunity participate brief ultrasound training session , also chance practice use ultrasounds clinical practice follow week . VI . Biostatistical Analysis Data collect assessment include binary variable presence aforementioned physical exam finding well categorize severity find ( mild , moderate , severe ) . Clinical definition category define ahead time . In addition , short questionnaire distribute subject patient study subject . The questionnaire ask subject comfort perform various aspect physical exam , use handheld ultrasound device , well experience teach medical student resident physical exam . Patient study subject answer questionnaire attitude towards examine physician use handheld ultrasound device . Primary outcome measure : Physical exam diagnostic accuracy resident compare diagnostic accuracy resident use pocket-sized ultrasound device . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . For sub-group resident pocket-sized ultrasound : compare diagnostic accuracy routine physical exam versus ultrasound ( i.e . much additional diagnostic yield ultrasound provide ? ) . 2 . Comparing diagnostic accuracy physical exam medical resident exam perform expert clinician . 3 . Comparing diagnostic accuracy pocket-sized ultrasound perform medical resident study perform expert radiologist echocardiographers . 4 . Assess degree agreement expert physical diagnostician trained radiologist use pocket-sized ultrasound . VII . Risks Discomforts We see potential harm either study subject patient study subject study . Ultrasound safe modality involve ionize radiation . We anticipate pain discomfort patient study subject . If previously-unknown abnormality note faculty radiologist study subject perform ultrasound patient study subject , patient 's primary care physician notify . VIII . Potential Benefits The benefit study participant satisfaction participate research study potential ultimately improve patient care . We believe potential global benefit study significant . If handheld ultrasound device prove helpful internal medical resident physical assessment patient , would recommend machine make available residency program . We hypothesize handheld ultrasound enable internist augment physical exam skill direct impact improve patient care . IX . Monitoring Quality Assurance Because study involve potential harm participant anticipate need independent safety monitor board . All participant , however , encourage report possible adverse event study coordinator , participant option withdraw study time .</detailed_description>
