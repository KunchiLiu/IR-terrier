	<brief_summary>Short course drug give HIV-infected pregnant woman reduce chance HIV infection pass child either pregnancy labour process . However , child also become infected drinking mother 's breastmilk contain HIV virus . In many poor , develop country Africa , breastfeed normal way infant feeding vitally important protection give child diseases diarrhoea malnutrition . Ideally would way make breastfeeding safer HIV transmission without lose advantage . A medical study recently suggest HIV-infected woman exclusively breastfed child i.e . give breastmilk without water , tea , formula milk solid food pas virus child degree woman MBF fluid food . It important confirm whether observation fact true . We hypothesize exclusive breastfeed HIV-infected mother carry low risk HIV transmission mix breastfeed . We propose follow 2,100 HIV-infected pregnant woman also HIV-uninfected woman time book clinic 24 month age . HIV-infected woman say intend breastfeed HIV-uninfected woman visit home breastfeed counsellor delivery support exclusive breastfeeding . HIV-infected woman choose breastfeed help clinic staff safely replace breastmilk milk . An independent team visit mother home collect information way feed child . Blood sample collect child different time simple heel prick blood store piece filter paper . By test sample compare type feeding time , able see child becomes infect whether exclusive breastfeed give protection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Short course antiretroviral regimen AZT ( Thai regimen ) , nevirapine ( Uganda HIVNET 012 regimen ) give HIV-infected woman pregnancy reduce utero intrapartum transmission child 40-50 % . However , gain threaten continued transmission HIV breast milk poor HIV-infected woman Africa realistic choice breastfeed . A recent study Durban compare first time , Mother-to-child transmission HIV ( MTCT ) rate 3 feed group viz . exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) , mixed breastfeeding ( MBF ) formula feeding . The result study show 3 month MTCT EBF mother similar mother give formula feed , MTCT EBF mother significantly low MBF ( 14.6 % vs. 24.1 % ) . This suggest EBF may carry additional risk MTCT HIV1 formula feeding . A prospective study require verify finding . We propose cohort study HIV-infected mother infant , examine risk post-natal transmission HIV relation infant feeding practice mother receive intensive breastfeed counsel support practise EBF 6 month age ( optimal duration EBF ) . The hypothesis test : Exclusive breastfeed HIV-infected woman carry additional risk post-natal transmission HIV exclusive formula feeding . The primary objective study determine effect infant feeding practice HIV infection rate infants 6 22 week age , secondly determine infant survival rate 24 month age accord feeding practice HIV status . Secondary objective : ) To determine HIV infection rate infant measure sample collect within 72 hour birth ; ii ) To determine HIV transmission incidence attributable duration different feeding practice ; iii ) To determine cumulative incidence vertical transmission EBF , MBF EFF infant ; iv ) To describe risk factor , feed practice , post-natal transmission HIV , include maternal infant morbidity breast health ; v ) To assess determinant transmission MBF adjusting exposure factor e.g . type age introduction food/milk ; vi ) To describe morbidity growth infant relation feeding practice HIV status ; vii ) To describe adherence rate EBF follow breastfeed support intervention . HIV infect woman counsel accord WHO/UNICEF/UNAIDS infant feed guideline . All HIV-infected woman random sub-sample HIV-uninfected woman recruit antenatally . Those choose breastfeed visit frequently home team breastfeed counsellor delivery promote support EBF . HIV-infected mother choose breastfeed support choice clinic-based staff . An independent team field monitor collect data weekly feed practice morbidity infants home visit . Blood sample collect finger/heel prick store filter paper prior qualitative quantitative estimation HIV viral content determine time transmission .</detailed_description>
