	<detailed_description>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) encompass group non-progressive , non-contagious motor condition cause physical disability human development . It infrequently note concurrent impairment sensory , intelligence , vision auditory patient . Many study document Cerebral palsy associate variety neuromotor disorder frequently affect speech production system . The speech function impairment vary widely due different severity disease involve . The investigator hypothesize impairment speech function may affect degree social participation eventually quality life ( QoL ) . The investigator study aim project include : ( 1 ) find difference speech function normal develop child child CP different severity ; ( 2 ) relationship speech function QoL child CP ; ( 3 ) seek predictable factor involve motor speech function child CP framework International Classification Functioning , Disability Health - Children Youth Version ( ICF-CY ) . This 3-year longitudinal project recruit 110-130 child total . The investigator child CP ( n=60~80 ) normal ( n=50 ) 2-12 year old consent family . The investigator 's study base structure ICF-CY . In first year , basic clinical assessment include motor , mental , vocabulary , motor speech function , general development , subjective questionnaire adaptation , participation , development quality life collect . During second third year , measurement repeat end 6- 12-month follow performance child CP normal development . The anticipated outcome study : ( 1 ) observe longitudinal change speech function QoL child CP . ( 2 ) Using ICF-CY item rehabilitation service describe speech function participation social life child CP . ( 3 ) To identify influence factor predictor motor speech function child CP .</detailed_description>
