	<detailed_description>Background Halitosis refers condition malodor oral cavity ( 2009 ) . Halitosis estimate affect 50 % population vary degree intensity etiology ( Meskin 1996 ) . In 80 % case halitosis secondary underlying oral condition ( Miyazaki , Sakao et al . 1995 ) .The etiology halitosis often cause food debris biofilm buildup teeth tongue , deep periodontal pocket , severe carious lesion poor dental restoration ( Yaegaki Sanada 1992 ; Morita Wang 2001 ; Morita Wang 2001 ) . The odor emanate oral cavity produce microbial putrefaction residual oral debris , result production malodorous Volatile Sulfur Compounds ( VSCs ) ( Porter Scully 2006 ) . Previous study show amount VSCs breath increase number , depth , bleed tendency periodontal pocket ( Quirynen , Zhao et al . 2002 ) . Therefore plaque control , directly impact periodontal health , important factor control halitosis . Halitosis diagnose 3 primary method ( Yaegaki Coil 2000 ; van den Broek , Feenstra et al . 2007 ) 1 . Organoleptic method : The primary reference standard detection oral malodor human nose method involve direct sniffing expire air train judge . This assessment also do scrap posterior dorsum tongue spoon smell content . 2 . Gas chromatography : This method choice researcher . It allow identification quantification individual component within air sample . The measurement VSC obtain differentiate use sample saliva , tongue coat breath . Disadvantages method high cost requirement highly trained personnel . This assessment do chairside require separate laboratory procedure . 3 . Sulfide monitoring : This method superior gas chromatography possible measure total VSC instead determine individual compound . An electrochemical reaction occur sulfur compound find expire air , collect tube patient 's mouth . The halimeter ( Interscan Corporation , Chatsworth CA ) recognize device sulfide monitoring . Management halitosis approach three primary method : masking product , mechanical reduction micro-organisms substance chemical reduction microorganism ( van den Broek , Feenstra et al . 2008 ) . Masking product like mint flavor chew gum short masking effect , last less 3 hour ( Reingewirtz , Girault et al . 1999 ) . Clinical study examine mechanical reduction microorganism reveal brush teeth exclusively effective reduce oral malodor ( Yaegaki Sanada 1992 ; Kleinberg Codipilly 2002 ) . With approximately 60 % VSCs originate surface tongue , brush dorsum tongue find effective tooth brush alone ( Yaegaki , Coil et al . 2002 ) . Furthermore , cleanse tongue tongue scraper show superior performance compare use toothbrush ( Pedrazzi , Sato et al . 2004 ) . Based previous study , dorsum tongue show important source oral malodor ( Loesche Kazor 2002 ) . Chemical approach minimize halitosis include mouth rinse specifically reduce total number microorganisms oral cavity . Chlorhexidine mouth rinse effective anti-plaque agent market today show reduce VSCs 43 % ( Rosenberg , Kulkarni et al . 1991 ; Addy Moran 1997 ) . The effect orthodontic treatment periodontal health investigate number study ( Zachrisson Zachrisson 1972 ; Zachrisson Alnaes 1974 ; Atack , Sandy et al . 1996 ) . Inflammation gingival tissue observe orthodontic treatment mainly fix appliance impede adequate oral hygiene measure result increase bacterial plaque accumulation ( Ristic , Vlahovic Svabic et al . 2007 ; Liu , Sun et al . 2011 ) . Halitosis report reach critical level fix orthodontic treatment ( Babacan , Sokucu et al . 2011 ) . Self-ligating bracket require elastic wire ligature , inbuilt mechanism open closed secure orthodontic archwire . In majority design , mechanism metal face bracket slot open closed instrument ( Wenger , Deacon et al . 2008 ) . Conventional bracket typically multiple wing wire ligate bracket use elastomeric ring stainless steel tie . The effect self-ligating bracket oral hygiene yet fully elucidate . Self-ligating bracket report accumulate less plaque orthodontic treatment compare traditional , twin bracket ( Pellegrini , Sauerwein et al . 2009 ) . This may attribute retentive area create elastomeric ring favor accumulation microorganism food debris . However , study show difference plaque accumulation two bracket type ( Pandis , Vlachopoulos et al . 2008 ; Garcez , Suzuki et al . 2011 ) . Objectives The advantage self-ligating bracket periodontal health yet determine . In addition , utilization tongue scrap adjunct traditional oral hygiene measure yet study orthodontic patient . The aim study evaluate effect bracket type plaque accumulation also impact appliance oral malodor . In addition , effect tongue scrap halitosis study patient undergoing orthodontic treatment . Aims The following three aim perform compare three different appliance system : Aim 1 : Compare impact self-ligating conventional bracket oral hygiene , specifically plaque accumulation . Aim 2 : Determine oral hygiene regimen include tongue scrap impact halitosis patient undergoing orthodontic treatment . Aim 3 : Determine self-ligating bracket impact minimize halitosis orthodontic treatment . Hypotheses Hypothesis 1 : Self-ligating bracket harbor less plaque normal bracket . Hypothesis 2 : Tongue scrap significantly decrease halitosis patient undergoing orthodontic treatment . Hypothesis 3 : Patients self-ligating bracket exhibit less halitosis measure halimeter . Screening Procedures Recruitment Each new patient come orthodontic clinic University Connecticut Health center assign resident faculty . So treating doctor screen new patient see whether need orthodontic treatment . If patient require orthodontic treatment , patient additional appointment collect orthodontic record develop treatment plan . Once treatment plan formulate , patient return discuss treatment option begin placement orthodontic appliance . At point patient ready appliance placement study coordinator screen orthodontic patient possible inclusion study check inclusion criterion discuss later . If patient suitable inclusion , study describe detail , write information give . Statistical Methods The purpose pilot study determine number patient need complete study order determine statistical significance . Since previous study exist measure combination variable , need pilot study determine final sample size project plan submit modification protocol IRB deem necessary recruit additional patient .</detailed_description>
