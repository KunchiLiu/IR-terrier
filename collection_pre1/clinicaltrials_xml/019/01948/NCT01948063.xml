	<brief_title>Ubiquinol ( Reduced COQ10 ) Patients With Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe sepsis septic shock cause significant morbidity mortality worldwide . An estimated 751,000 ( 3 per 1,000 population ) case severe sepsis occur United States year , result approximately 215,000 death . Septic shock characterize hypotension , hypermetabolic state , lactic acidosis , potentially death . In addition , economic burden health care system patient suffer severe sepsis striking . Weycker et al . report patient suffer severe sepsis require average $ 45,000 dollar medical care cost index admission $ 78,500 dollar first year post-diagnosis . These figure rival entity acute myocardial infarction , trauma , stroke . Whereas significant amount research therapeutic intervention focus `` early hour '' disease acute myocardial infarction , stroke , trauma , less attention give initial stage severe sepsis septic shock . Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) safe feasible medicinal intervention strong scientific rationale use septic shock . CoQ10 key component mitochondrion , serve electron transport medium complex I/II complex III . A lesion point electron transport chain result inadequate production ATP cell . In septic shock , CoQ10 level profoundly decrease therefore production energy may compromise . CoQ10 two essential role critically ill patient sepsis : 1 ) production ATP 2 ) reduction free oxygen radical . CoQ10 's key role electron transport chain may prevent well-described mitochondrial dysfunction occur patient septic shock . Thus , two essential role form pathophysiological basis propose study . In follow proposal , investigator plan perform pilot study evaluate capacity ubiquinol ( reduced form COQ10 ) attenuate mitochondrial injury , attenuate inflammation/vascular endothelial injury , effect human metabolome , absorb . The overall goal line research determine CoQ10 attenuate oxidative injury improve mitochondrial function lead overall improved outcome patient suffer septic shock . In order achieve long-term goal , investigator propose pilot feasibility trial determine CoQ10 absorption critical illness , capacity mitigate inflammatory injury oxidative injury , ability maintain mitochondrial electron transport chain functionality . This pilot study also provide key feasibility data blind logistical issue necessary execution larger-scale investigation .</detailed_description>
