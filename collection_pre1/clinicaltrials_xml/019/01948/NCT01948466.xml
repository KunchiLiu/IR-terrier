Four elementary school Alachua County , Florida chosen participate study . Two school high participation free reduce fee school lunch program two low participation . The school divide two participate intervention ( one high free/reduced lunch participation one low ) two serve control . All school morning broadcast announcement 15-30 second fruit vegetable `` commercial '' show student K-5th grade . Given scope ( 1 year , limited budget ) pilot project , assess purchasing consumption behavior 3rd , 4th , 5th grader school , rather child .
