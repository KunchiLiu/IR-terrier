	<brief_title>Nintedanib Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Failed Up Two Previous Chemotherapy Regimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( FGFRI ) amplify squamous cell lung cancer patient treat BIBF 1120 ( nintedanib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare 6-month PFS rate entire FGFRI amplify group versus FGFRI wild-type patient . II . Compare 6-month PFS rate FGFRI amplify group ( low , intermediate , high ) versus historical control FGFRI wild-type patient . III . To assess follow endpoint overall FGFRI group : PFS , overall survival ( OS ) , confirm tumor response rate , adverse event . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . The relation FGFRI gene copy number PFS , OS , confirm response rate , adverse event . II . The relationship fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) polymorphisms toxicity efficacy . OUTLINE : Patients receive nintedanib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
