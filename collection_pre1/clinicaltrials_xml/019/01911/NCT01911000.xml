	<detailed_description>1.1 Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) standard treatment HCC third common cause cancer death globally . It also second cause cancer mortality Korea , despite incidence HCC fifth . The important cause discrepancy connect fact significant portion HCC detect unresectable status . At point HCC diagnosis , 30 % patient could receive standard curative treatment , like resection , liver transplantation , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , TACE show randomized trial improve survival compare symptomatic therapy alone , patient without macrovascular involvement , extrahepatic disease tumor relate symptom . However , recent review TACE , TACE might contraindicate recommended patient show vascular tumor invasion , 10 cm size , poor portal blood flow and/or repeat poor response . 1.2 HCC PVTT The presence PVTT patient HCC one significant prognostic factor poor prognosis , without treatment , survival le 3 month . Recently , Sorafenib , one target agent , show survival advantage unresectable HCC patient two randomize study . In study , sorafenib improve approximately three month overall survival increment , however , median survival duration 10.7 month experiment group ( receive sorafenib ) , even 6.5 month Asian-Pacific trial . Additionally , possibility sorafenib effect could reduce patient hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) suggest subgroup analysis . 1.3 Radiation therapy ( RT ) HCC The use RT HCC increase radiation technological advance . In unresectable patient , RT show 50 60 % response rate dose response relationship . Especially , HCC patient combine PVTT , RT show 50 % local control 10 month survival duration . Despite standard treatment HCC combine PVTT sorafenib , Korean Liver Cancer Study Group ( KLCSG ) recommend RT option patient . Investigators previously report retrospective study schedule interval TACE follow RT HCC combine PVTT 60 % patient show objective response without significant elevation complication . 1.4 Hyperthermia It report hyperthermia effective S phase , Low partial oxygen pressure ( pO2 ) , acidic condition , low perfusion site know radio-resistant . Because characteristic , consider valuable radiosensitizer cancer treatment , theoretically . Furthermore , mild hyperthermia ( 41 41.5 ºC ) promote tumor reoxygenation . 1.5 Purpose study Based study , start prospective study evaluate objective response adverse event combination treatment RT hyperthermia TACE unresectable HCC patient combine PVTT . 2 . Hypothesis sample size Several prospective trial show 50 % 60 % objective response rate conventional RT administer HCC PVTT , thus determine objective response rate conventional RT 60 % . We expect additional 20 % increase local progression free rate conventional RT treat combined RT hyperthermia HCC PVTT . To determine sample size , design 80 % power detect absolute difference 20 % point objective response rate combine RT hyperthermia conventional RT , two-sided alpha level 0.05 . A total 87 patient require study consider drop-out rate 10 % .</detailed_description>
