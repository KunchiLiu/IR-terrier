	<brief_title>Evaluating Correction Non-invasive Estimated Continuous Cardiac Output Cardiac Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determination cardiac output ( CO ) often desirable assess patient 's hemodynamic condition surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass . However , current method continuous CO measurement still base invasive technique , thermodilution via pulmonary artery catheter ( Swan-Ganz ) , transpulmonary thermodilution via PiCCO kit , pulse contour analysis via arterial line ( FloTrac PiCCO ) . Noninvasive CO measurement patient currently impractical , measurement method available base invasive technique . However , two develop trend kind monitor occur . There one shift toward noninvasive technology trend toward continuous measurement rather intermittent measurement . Therefore , continuous CO ( CCO ) monitoring less invasive would desirable . The pulse contour method one technology use min-invasive monitoring CO . It base relationship arterial blood pressure stroke volume greatly improve since early 1950s . Arterial waveform-based CO frequently use current medical practice , still require arterial puncture . Pulse wave transit time proven good correlation stroke volume . Pulse wave transit time consist pre-ejection period , pulse wave transit time artery , pulse wave transit time peripheral artery , compensates effect change systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) . Based relationship pulse wave transit time stroke volume , noninvasive device , estimate CCO ( esCCO ) , via measure electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , pulse oximeter wave , arterial blood pressure develop Sugo et al.. It great advantage simplify CO measurement combine result familiar noninvasive monitoring technique . Thus , may useful technique optimize medical treatment . In one previous study , esCCO compare continuous thermodilution CO ( TDCO ) , measurements 36 postoperative cardiac surgery patient , show bias ( mean difference ) -0.06 precision ( 1 SD ) 0.82 L/min . In addition , esCCO compare intermittent bolus TDCO , show correlation coefficient 0.82 ( P &lt; 0.001 , n = 24 ) , bias -0.63 , precision 1.01 L/min ( n = 119 ) . The result clinical use esCCO suggest measurement accuracy comparable thermodilution method general population . However , intraoperative comparison cardiac surgery patient report . This study design accuracy patient undergoing cardiac surgery . Specific aim 1 . To investigate correlation esCCO traditional CO measurement cardiac surgical patient . 2 . To investigate intraoperative accuracy time point ecCCO traditional CO measurement patient undergoing bypass cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
