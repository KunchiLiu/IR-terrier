	<brief_summary>In premature infant , apnea prematurity one major clinical problem . Caffeine currently worldwide therapy reduce number severity apneas . This practice show safe cognitive neurodevelopmental outcome 18 21 month age . However , caffeine 100 % effective , may little effect hypoxemia bradycardia . Infants intractable apneas unresponsive caffeine treatment may require endotracheal intubation mechanical ventilation . This procedure invasive associate complication increase risk chronic lung disease adverse neurodevelopmental outcome . Therefore , alternative treatment modality would preferable would prevent infant require endotracheal intubation . The investigator test overall hypothesis small concentration inhale CO2 ( ~1 % ) effective treat apnea prematurity . The investigator complete three study preterm infant show inhalation low concentration CO2 , infant caffeine , regularize breathe decrease apneas significantly . The effect inhalation CO2 infant already caffeine , unknown . The hypothesis test inhalation low concentration CO2 ( 1 % ) significantly reduce apnea infant treat caffeine . The investigator three specific aim proposal . 1 ) investigator want know apnea rate ( number apneas â‰¥5 seconds/hour ) decrease CO2 inhalation preterm infant already caffeine treatment apnea prematurity ; 2 ) investigator want know whether inhalation CO2 make breathe regular le apneic time whether decrease prolong apnea ( &gt; 20 second ) infant already caffeine treatment apnea prematurity ; 3 ) investigator want assess effect inhalation low concentration CO2 regional oxygen saturation brain measure near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) apneas . This see whether CO2 , protect cerebral blood flow , minimize decrease cerebral oxygenation apneas . This study entail new possibly physiological method treat apneas prematurity add present treatment caffeine . These two treatment together , could minimize number severity apneas possibly decrease need mechanical ventilation preterm infant .</brief_summary>
