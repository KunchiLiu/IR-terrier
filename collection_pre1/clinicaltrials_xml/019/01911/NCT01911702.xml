Girardis MANAGEMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH ACUTE ABDOMEN SUBMITTED TO URGENT ABDOMINAL SURGERY : pilot study randomize multicentre INTRODUCTION Acute abdomen clinical manifestation irritation peritoneum , due intra-abdominal generalized infection . Mortality link peritonitis extremely high variable 42 % 80 % associate systemic framework severe sepsis . This variability link number risk factor , include advanced age patient , presence comorbidity , male sex , poor nutritional status , number reoperations ; well specific characteristic related type infection , time surgery , begin appropriate early antibiotic therapy . The post-operative treatment patient peritonitis significantly affect outcome . The center involve study three : 1. post operative intensive care unit ( ICU ) - Modena University Hospital 2. reanimation unit - Carpi Hospital 3. intensive care unit ( ICU ) - Modena New Civil Hospital OBJECTIVES PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : difference two treatment group different fluidic strategy term 30-day mortality . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : difference two treatment group different fluidic strategy term surgical complication , occurrence organ failure , duration mechanical ventilation length stay ICU . Please refer Section 6 definition endpoint / response variable secondary goal . PLAN STUDY Study set The study conduct follow facility : 1. post operative intensive care unit ( ICU ) Modena University Hospital 2. intensive care unit ( ICU ) Modena Baggiovara 3. reanimation unit Carpi Inclusion criterion All patient acute abdomen undergo abdominal surgery emergency present arrival ICU least sign bad perfusion . In definition acute abdomen , follow framework include : 1. primary peritonitis : bacterial contamination peritoneal cavity microorganisms start extra-peritoneal site ( hematogenous sepsis / bacteremia , female genital tract course pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) , retroperitoneum ) ; translocation microorganism bowel 2. secondary peritonitis : bacterial contamination peritoneal cavity result phlogosis perforation digestive tract female genital tract : 1. acute abdominal infection ( appendicitis , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , gallbladder empyema , suppurative cholangitis ) 2. disease ( occlusion mesenteric , gastric duodenal ulcer , strangulate hernia volvulus , colic neoplasia , toxic megacolon , rupture intraperitoneal visceral abscess ) 3. various intestinal disease ( tuberculosis , typhoid fever , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection , infection Clostridium ) 4. penetrate abdominal trauma ( rupture perforation hollow internal organ ) 5. surgical operation ( stomach duodenum , ileum , colon - rectum , bile - duct ) dehiscence anastomosis / suture 3. tertiary relapse peritonitis , understood persistent recurrent peritonitis apparently adequate medical surgical treatment secondary peritonitis 4. intestinal ischemia 5. pancreatitis without evidence hemorrhagic- necrotic area The condition hypoperfusion identify : 1. perioperative metabolic acidosis explain morbid condition 2. arterial hypotension PAM &lt; 60 mmHg less 15 % preoperative Exclusion Criteria 1 . Patients chronic renal failure already receive dialysis treatment . 2 . Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) &lt; 12 month New York Hearth Classification ( NHYA ) class &gt; 3 3 . Patients judged admission subject resuscitative measure severity comorbidity 4 . Patients massive hemorrhage operative room immediate perioperative need blood transfusion abundant blood product &gt; 5 unit Erythrocyte Concentrates ( EC ) 5 . Patients schedule Orthotopic Liver Transplantation ( OLT ) 6 . Patients young 18 year old In definition ACS , chest pain suspect coronary origin without ST-segment elevation include . According classification accept European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) American College Cardiology ( ACC ) , serum dosage cardiac troponins make diagnosis myocardial infarction . STUDY PROCEDURES Screening inclusion At entrance ICU patient meet criterion inclusion n't present exclusion criterion - evaluate randomization . The attend physician notify coordinate center soon deem identified patient enrol . The coordinating center Intensive Care Unit University Hospital Modena . Randomization must do time admission ICU . The method randomization `` parallel group '' , type simple randomization randomization list obtain use random number generator computerize 1:1 ratio . Patients meet inclusion criterion assign telephone medical coordinator : 1. group receive volemic standard treatment ( conventional ) 2. group receive volemic small treatment ( restrictive ) The contact number randomization always 0594224896 Group `` conventional '' Goals treatment : 1. arterial pressure mean ≥ 65 mmHg equal pre-operative 2. diuretic rhythm ≥ 1 ml / Kg / h 3. venous saturation vena cava ≥ 70 % mixed venous saturation Swan Ganz 's catheter ( SG ) ≥ 65 % 4. base excess ( BE ) &gt; - 3 5 . Central Venous Pression ( PVC ) ≥ 8 mmHg ; patient undergo mechanical ventilation , limit may raise 12-15 mmHg . To achieve therapeutic goal set execute volemic fill reach central venous pressure value 8-10 mmHg . Crystalloid solution specifically balance III , Ringer solution alternatively glucose solution infuse 5 % patient serum sodium ≥ 145 milliequivalent ( mEq ) / L. For group patient , overall water balance wo n't bind . If proper fill target n't yet achieve , patient begin infusion vasoactive drug follow practice department . If unable get goal value venous saturation consider : 1 . The chance infuse additional volume fluids 2. chance transfuse concentrate red blood cell 3 . The chance infuse dobutamine 20 microg / kg / min Group `` restrictive '' Goals treatment : 1. arterial pressure mean ≥ 60 mmHg ≥ 10 % le preoperative value 2. diuretic rhythm ≥ 0.5 ml / kg / h 3. venous saturation vena cava ≥ 60 % mixed venous saturation ≥ 55 % SG 4 . BE &gt; - 5 5 . PVC goal necessary To achieve therapeutic goal set execute volemic fill value PVC ≤ 5 mmHg maximum value 2 mmHg incoming If proper fill target n't yet achieve , patient begin infusion vasoactive drug follow practice department . If 12 hour admission water balance &gt; 10-15 ml / kg / h infusion furosemide initiate order bring budget patient 10-15 ml / kg 24 hour . DATA COLLECTION Data Collection Program Data collection do compile data collection form . In particular , follow type data collection format fill : 1. basal randomization card ( Record Form 1 ) 2. card 6 hour randomization ( Record Form 2 ) 3 . 24 hour card ( Record Form 3 ) 4. daily continuation card ( long patient admit Post Operative Intensive Therapy , Record Form 4 ) 5 . Conclusion card ( Record Form 5 ) The basal card contain : 1. patient 's personal detail 2. information accord remote proximal medical history 3. patient 's vital parameter 4. patient 's therapy The final board collect data verify : 1. patient 's discharge hospital 2. thirtieth day hospitalization 3. patient 's death END POINT / VARIABLE RESPONSE Study end point : 1 . Primary : Mortality 30 day 2 . Secondary : 1 . Number surgical complication ( anastomotic dehiscence , need re-operation , need percutaneous drainage evacuation , development abdominal hypertension ) . 2 . Occurrence acute respiratory failure identify respiratory exchange value P / F le 300 mmHg 3 . Occurrence lack circulation use vasoactive amine post-operative 4 . Occurrence acute renal failure ( number extracorporeal treatment / serum creatinine ≥ 1.9 mg / dl ) 5 . Occurrence hepatic insufficiency serum total bilirubin value great 2.0 mg / dl 6 . Days mechanical ventilation 7 .
