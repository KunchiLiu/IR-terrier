	<brief_title>A Pilot Study : Treatment Achilles Tendinopathy With Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal pilot level study correlate ultrasound elastography technique standard clinically base outcome measure within set small sample size group patient affect moderate-to- severe , chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) midsubstance Achilles tendinopathy ( AT ) . Investigators conduct 24-week , 2-arm randomize control pilot study determine whether novel elastography technique ( AE ) shear wave imaging ( SWI ) , new quantitative method ultrasound ( US ) imaging , correlate valid clinical outcome measure ( VISA-A conventional US ) . Methods base recently publish clinical trial autologous blood injection treat AT incorporate novel US outcome measure Achilles tendon appearance stiffness , i.e . elasticity . The result multi-disciplinary pilot study use help plan separate large scale study evaluate effect platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) therapy Achilles tendinopathy elastography include potential outcome measure also correlate standard clinical outcome survey . Pain function evaluate self-report use validated clinical outcome questionnaire ( VISA-A ) . Disease modification assess novel US-based AE SWI method stiffness change ( biomechanical ) correlate morphologic change use conventional US . A large study evaluate effect PRP healing AT , correlate elastography assessment , include sham injection arm . Intervention Subjects assign PRP group receive PRP injection ultrasound guidance . The injection take 15 minute . Each subject undergo palpatory ultrasound Achilles tendon exam . Tender area associate Achilles tendon identify . Physical exam follow Achilles tendon ultrasound serve visual guidance injection . At injection session , research nurse perform single standard antecubital blood draw ( 35 mL ) . The PRP obtain sample use two-stage spinning technique : 1st separate red blood cell platelet , 2nd concentrate platelet yield approximately 4 mL concentrate autologous platelet . This layer platelet rich plasma place syringe centrifuge machine . Platelet count subject ' whole blood PRP process blood analyze . Platelet count whole blood vary individual . The optimal quantity platelet growth factor require tissue heal know , clinically effective concentration describe great 4 time baseline autologous whole blood platelet concentration . Therefore , platelet concentration yield may important implication clinical outcome correlation . In order validate consistent platelet concentration yield across subject , investigator sample 1 mL whole blood ( approximately one lab Vacutainer ) additional 1 mL platelet rich plasma lab analysis platelet concentration use standard lab automate analyzer . This extra 1 ml whole blood drawn time 35 ml describe drawn . The 3 ml platelet rich plasma inject subject 's Achilles tendon . The specimen keep store . The blood analyze day procedure perform . This require store specimen prevent erroneous label platelet concentration different subject . After injection , subject rest 5 minute . Participants give acetaminophen `` as-needed '' analgesia telephone 3 day inquire side effect adverse event . Subjects place boot two week gradual return activity . Subjects also provide crutch non-weight bearing 24 hour . Data Safety Monitoring Plan The data safety monitoring plan implement study consist , part , monthly staff meeting discus subject enrollment , safety , retention . These meeting intend monitor participant study flow initial eligibility assessment study completion . Standing agenda item meeting side effect , adverse event participant retention . Unanticipated adverse event complication evaluate treated necessary Principal Investigator primary Co-Investigator . In addition , follow process help ensure timely detection , evaluation treatment : 1 . The Principal Investigator primary Co-Investigator screen subject adverse event prior treatment PRP . Standardized form use monitor report adverse event . The PI immediately available staff via cell phone case serious adverse event . The PI immediately report serious adverse event UW Research Subjects Advocate use standardized form . Reports make use subject identification number without identify information . 2 . Autologous injection PRP find safe . The system use chosen close system prevent contamination ease use . Although safe , internal monitoring PRP injection safety also perform . The study coordinator ass PRP injection subject 3 day treatment follow question brief telephone interview : `` Do think side effect injection 've receive ? '' [ If `` Yes '' ] `` Please tell . '' Information regard side effect adverse event make available PI , decide subject require medical care . Investigators expect serious adverse event ( SAEs ) well equip manage . Investigators see significant adverse event combine ( UW Radiology Sports Medicine ) clinic use PRP . Subjects reaction acetaminophen injection option call study personnel time . The PI primary Co-Investigator share on-call duty subject adverse event pager 24/7 basis . Subjects require significant evaluation care refer UW Hospital Emergency Department . Adverse event diagnostic ultrasound extremely unlikely ultrasound consider non-significant risk FDA . All study procedure monitor document , unlikely situation adverse event occurs , follow resolution . The PI ( Board-Certified radiologist ) ass whether finding report subject . Findings would report consider clinically relevant . Findings consider normal variant ( eg . variant anatomy ) clinically insignificant ( eg . simple hepatic cyst ) report . Clinically relevant finding report subject within 24 hour scan , also report subject 's physician accord whether subject indicated desire consent form .</detailed_description>
