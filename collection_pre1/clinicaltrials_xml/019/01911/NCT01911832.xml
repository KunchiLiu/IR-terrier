	<brief_summary>The incidence cancer esophagogastric junction rapidly rise recent three decade , surgery still remain optimum therapy . For Siewert 's type II III cancer , esophagojejunostomy total gastrectomy Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy subtotal gastrectomy regard two main surgical approach . Esophagojejunostomy total gastrectomy bring high survival rate low local recurrence rate may also induce pulmonary infection regurgitation . Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy subtotal gastrectomy need reconstruction gastric tube width reconstruction tube key factor predicate prognosis . However , evidence supply comprehensive standard width reconstruction tube often range 3 cm 6 cm . Both narrow wide reconstruction tube advantage disadvantage . So prospective trail recruit patient three group : total gastrostomy group ( TG group ) , wide gastric tube group ( WG group ) narrow gastric tube group ( NG group ) . And investigator compare quality life use integrated questionnaire QLQ-STO22 QLQ-C30 related symptom relief main endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>With decrease prevalence gastric cancer , incidence cancer esophagogastric junction rapidly rise recent three decade , especially North America Europe . Despite use chemotherapy , 5-year survival rate still low ( less 30 % ) cancer esophagogastric junction . Surgery still remain optimum therapy cancer esophagogastric junction . For Siewert 's type II III cancer , esophagojejunostomy total gastrectomy Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy subtotal gastrectomy regard two main surgical approach . For quality life , prospective trial provide evidence compare two approach . With complete clearance lymph node , esophagojejunostomy total gastrectomy bring high 5-year survival rate , decrease rate local recurrence . However , due whole gastrectomy , patient often represent bile regurgitation may induce pulmonary infection , regurgitation asthma weight loss . Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy subtotal gastrectomy reserve partial gastric body reconstruct gastric tube . The remain gastric body still peristalses function well stomach . At time , remain gastric body keep acid-secreting function may induce acid regurgitation surgery . For Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy subtotal gastrectomy , width reconstruction gastric tube key factor predicate prognosis , often range 3 cm 6 cm , without universal standard . Narrow gastric tube may lack enough blood supply , result , increase rate anastomotic leakage . On contrary , wide gastric tube take much thoracic capacity may disturb normal pulmonary cardiovascular function . Tabira colleague conduct prospective trail prof width gastric tube relevance local blood supply , anastomotic leakage postoperative nutrition , study lack enough patient may increase bias . So , reliable evidence predict quality postoperative life . The prospective trail recruit patient cancer esophagogastric junction . And eligible patient assign three group : total gastrostomy group ( TG group ) , wide gastric tube group ( WG group ) narrow gastric tube group ( NG group ) . Quality life include integrate questionnaire QLQ-STO22 QLQ-C30 related symptom relief assess primary endpoint . And local recurrence , disease free survival , metastatic rate , overall survival short-term complication surgery also observe secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
