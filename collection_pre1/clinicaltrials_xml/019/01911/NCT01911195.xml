	<brief_summary>Currently unknown human brain reorganize network organization generate conscious experience cognitive activity period unconsciousness . Therefore , purpose study assess cognitive activity reconstruct general anesthesia . The investigator hypothesize brain 's transition unconsciousness consciousness full cognition complex process occur extended period time . Specifically , investigator hypothesize follow order cognitive reconstitution : responsiveness command , attention , complex scan visual tracking , work memory , executive function . Volunteers healthy participant anesthetize commonly use anesthetic drug well non-anesthetized group control circadian influence . A total 60 subject recruit study . All subject ( male female ) perform basic test cognition laptop computer 30-minute interval study . The test battery administer assembled ass multiple cognitive function order determine whether cognitive process return baseline function . Electroencephalogram ( measure brain electrical activity ) data monitor recorded anesthesia cognitive testing , subsequent analysis . This study significant could lead good understanding neural correlate human consciousness , well normal abnormal conscious state transition ( include barrier transition ) .</brief_summary>
