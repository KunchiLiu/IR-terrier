	<brief_summary>The overall goal proposal investigate potential benefit metformin novel therapy treatment endometrial cancer . Investigators evaluate effect short-term metformin treatment endometrium obese woman endometrial cancer compare patient 's endometrial biopsy treatment metformin post-treatment hysterectomy specimen . Participants : Obese woman undergo surgical stag endometrial cancer also receive short-term treatment ( 1-4 week ) metformin continue day prior surgical staging . The effect metformin proliferation , apoptosis downstream signal pathway compare pre-treatment endometrial biopsy post-treatment hysterectomy specimen . Tissue microarrays construct immunohistochemstry perform evaluate proliferation , apoptosis change critical signaling pathway mediate metformin , finding correlate vitro preclinical study . Fresh tissue also obtain , Western immunoblotting use assess expression phosphorylated form downstream target metformin . The hypothesis treatment metformin result decrease proliferative marker increase marker apoptosis endometrial cancer tumor . AMPK phosphorylation inhibition critical downstream target mTOR pathway see post-treatment hysterectomy specimen . Metabolomic profiling also perform tumor associate biofluids ( i.e . serum urine ) treatment metformin identify potential biomarkers response therapy .</brief_summary>
