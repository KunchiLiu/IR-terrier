	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics MEHD7945A combination chemotherapy ( either cisplatin plus 5-FU carboplatin plus paclitaxel ) participants previously untreated R/M SCCHN . There two stage arm study : Dose-limiting Toxicity ( DLT ) -evaluation stage ( Stage I ) cohort-expansion stage ( Stage II ) . In Stage I , DLTs assess DLT Assessment Window 21 day ( i.e. , Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 1 Day 21 ) arm . In Stage II , participant enrol characterize safety , pharmacokinetics , anti-tumor activity MEHD7945A combination cisplatin + 5-FU carboplatin + paclitaxel identify recommended Phase II dose .</brief_summary>
