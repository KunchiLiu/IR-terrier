	<brief_summary>This project undertaken test hypothesis implement community base package care woman hypertensive disorder pregnancy result overall improvement maternal neonatal outcome . This base premise three main modifiable reason woman ( fetuses/newborns ) die due pregnancy complication : 1 ) delay woman recognize seriousness condition ; 2 ) delay assess transport center capable provide effective life-saving intervention ; 3 ) delay health facility provide intervention . The treatment pre-eclampsia poorly access LMIC 1 ) magnesium sulfate ( MgSO4 ) prevention treatment grand mal seizure eclampsia ; 2 ) oral antihypertensive medication lower maternal BP reduce risk stroke . The CLIP pilot definitive cRCT investigate whether community level intervention include implementation CLIP package ( oral antihypertensive therapy indicate , intramuscular ( i.m . ) MgSO4 indicate ; appropriate referral CEmOC facility indicate ) care reduce incidence all-cause maternal morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We design two-phased community ( include PHC-level ) cRCT encompass rural urban setting fully power : - Ogun State , Nigeria - Maputo Gaza Province , Mozambique - Hyderabad Matiari district Sindh Province , Pakistan . - Belgaum Bagalkot district Karnataka State , India The trial phase Pilot CLIP trial Definitive CLIP trial basis satisfactory rate use ( ≥50 % ) CLIP 'package care ' appropriate woman country Mozambique . Mozambique unique rely extended period feasibility pilot test Trial system tool directly begin definitive trial . Foregoing Pilot Mozambique felt appropriate base experience community-based surveillance ensure timeline trial meet within manageable budget . For country , use package Pilot phase define appropriate referral ( urgent non-urgent ) facility able provide comprehensive emergency obstetric care ( CEmOC ) appropriate woman first six month Pilot CLIP trial . A primary component CLIP intervention antenatal risk assessment guide PIERS teh Move mHealth decision aid . The CLIP version PIERS Move tool ( CLIP POM ) integrate miniPIERS predictive score clinical data collection system single application . Community health worker country assess woman accord visit protocol , enter clinical data CLIP POM mobile application . The application provide recommendation care accord meet one trigger event list , per protocol . Triggers identify indicate treatment and/or transport ( urgently , define within 4hrs ) CEmOC facility follow : 1 . Unconsciousness ( MgSO4 sBP ≥160 mmHg [ reasonably sure unconsciousness associate severe pre-eclampsia due obstetric sepsis ] , urgent transport ) 2 . Signs recent stroke seizure ( methyldopa sBP ≥160 mmHg [ ensure BP lower much ] , MgSO4 , urgent transport ) 3 . Significant vaginal bleeding ( MgSO4 sBP ≥140 mmHg [ presume abruption associate severe pre-eclampsia ] , urgent transport ) . 4 . No fetal movement felt previous 12 hr ( urgent transport [ threshold identify risk fetus alive time screen ] 39 ) 5. sBP ≥160 mmHg ( dBP ≥ 110 mmHg Nigeria ) ( methyldopa , MgSO4 , urgent transport [ consistent severe pre-eclampsia ] ) 6 . Heavy proteinuria ( ≥4+ dipstick - predictive stillbirth miniPIERS cohort , urgent transport ) 7. miniPIERS predict probability ≥25 % ( MgSO4 , urgent transport ) 8 . Shock index &gt; 1.7 Nigeria ( Shock index ratio pulse/sBP ; high shock index indication poor prognosis woman postpartum haemorrhage ) Non-urgent transport ( non-ambulance service ) , mean assessment CEmOC facility within 24 hour , advise woman non-severe hypertension ( sBP 140-159 mmHg ) meet criterion one 7/8 trigger . In Mozambique Pakistan additional CLIP trigger base use audio oximeter also include POM decision aid . As original miniPIERS model , enhance model include SpO2 use risk threshold ≥25 % predicted probability identify high-risk case . Recommendations base updated miniPIERS model include treatment MgSO4 urgent referral . An additional independent trigger SpO2 &lt; 93 % also use Mozambique Pakistan indicate urgent referral . In Nigeria update Microlife CRADLE VSA blood pressure device use additional trigger include severe diastolic blood pressure severe shock index coincide traffic light warning sign include device .</detailed_description>
