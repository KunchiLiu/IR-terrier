	<brief_summary>Invasive bacterial infection dangerous relatively uncommon disease bacteria spread deep body cause disease like blood poisoning ( 'bacteraemia ' ) , pneumonia , meningitis others . The various bacteria streptococcus family important cause , often leading patient require intensive care despite , strain , one five patient die . One notable form call necrotising fasciitis , condition bacteria rapidly spread destroys layer tissue skin . As individual vary greatly risk develop serious infection , investigate genome , inherit blueprint body , patient differs healthy volunteer help explain disease develop others . For streptococcal bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae approach already prove successful ; others `` Group A '' strain ( Streptococcus pyogenes ) yet explore carry excellent potential . The investigator secure support Lee Spark Necrotising Fasciitis Foundation recruit membership survivor streptococcal infection family member . The investigator also ask infection specialist NHS hospital invite patient look . The investigator also small exist collection . Taking part would involve register information website , discuss study telephone provide u sample saliva investigator isolate DNA . The investigator would prepare sample analysis genome compare patient family exist reference collection healthy volunteer use technology read DNA code . Our study first key step renew effort understand determinant invasive streptococcal infection , important develop good treatment vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants genetics study divide cases/survivors family member ( relative parent ) . To participate survivor , individual must meet criterion 1A . Their illness occur anytime birth enrolment , provide happen 1st January 1980 . Family member take part invite survivor family request research team . In family two survivor identify , remain first seconddegree relative survivor eligible participate . The recruitment team subdivide relatives enrolment healthy ( Criteria 2 ) intermediate ( Criteria 3 ) phenotype . In family single survivor , recruitment team ass whether survivor meet criteria 1B . If parent survivor eligible participate healthy phenotype ( Criteria 4 ) . 1 . Cases/Survivors A . All Cases ( survivor pedigree , trio simplex case ; exist serum sample Imperial College London collection ) Either : Isolation Streptococcus specie normally sterile site ( e.g . blood , joint fluid , etc . ) acute illness since 1st January 1980 Severe clinical presentation streptococcal toxic shock , necrotising fasciitis , pneumonia , puerperal sepsis , meningitis since 1st January 1980 plus concurrent Streptococcus specie isolate nonsterile site ( e.g . abscess , wound swab , pu ) And : Admitted NHS hospital England Wales Northern Ireland B. Trio case ( survivor trio ) All : Meets criteria 1A Less 40 year age time illness None time illness : heart disease , diabetes mellitus , cancer , steroid use , chronic lung disease , immunocompromise , intravenous drug use alcoholism Plus one : More one episode illness meeting criterion 1A Admission high dependency intensive care unit Requirement surgical procedure ( include drainage abscess collection ) And : Both parent alive time recruitment 2 . Unaffected phenotype family member multicase pedigree All : Biological first second degree relative survivor meeting criterion 1A family two member meet criteria None : severe streptococcal illness require hospital illness , recurrent tonsillitis recurrent impetigo ( recurrent define one episode two consecutive year ) 3 . Intermediate phenotype family member multicase pedigree All : Biological first second degree relative survivor meeting criterion 1A family two member meet criteria History severe bacterial illness require hospital admission , recurrent tonsillitis recurrent impetigo ( recurrent define one episode two consecutive year ) 4 . Parent motherfatherchild trio All : Biological parent case meeting criterion 1B None : severe bacterial illness require hospital admission , recurrent tonsillitis recurrent impetigo ( recurrent define one episode two consecutive year ) 1 . Adults ( age &gt; 16 year ) unable consent .</criteria>
