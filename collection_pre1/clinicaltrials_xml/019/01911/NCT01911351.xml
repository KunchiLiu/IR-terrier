	<detailed_description>Title : High-concentration continuous flow nitrous oxide use procedural-induced pain anxiety pediatric minor procedure Brief Summary : Background : Over past 10 year pediatric emergency department ( PED ) throughout country adopt concept `` ouchless '' PED , use pharmacologic non-pharmacologic method achieve goal . There number minor procedure perform routinely PED . Despite interest `` ouchless '' PED , many procedure perform without full attention patient comfort . Some procedure , laceration repair , require local anesthesia , others , intravenous catheter placement , usually perform without local anesthesia . All minor procedure , however , one risk parenteral procedural sedation outweigh benefit . Due awareness try create pain-free experience possible , use high-concentration nitrous oxide ( &gt; 50 % ) pediatric outpatient set grown use PEDs throughout country . Nitrous oxide colorless , non-narcotic , analgesic gas . Its efficacy safety well documented anesthesia , pediatric dental literature . Over last 30 year , nitrous oxide incorporated outpatient pediatric set procedural analgesia . At Jacobi Medical Center ( JMC ) , nitrous oxide successfully use child undergo variety minor procedure PED . Several study publish use nitrous oxide decrease pain anxiety pediatric emergency setting ; however , previous study use high concentration nitrous oxide either observational , focused narrow age range , single procedure type procedure associate moderate severe pain , fracture reduction . This investigation , unlike previous study , include wide age range child , well variety painful anxiety provoke minor procedure commonly perform PED . We choose include variety pre-defined minor procedure , rather single procedure , order ass feasibility benefit nitrous oxide many minor procedure perform routinely daily basis pediatric emergency department . It allow u quantify rate effectiveness decrease pain and/or anxiety use high concentration ( &gt; 50 % ) nitrous oxide expand use nitrous oxide show superior standard management reduction procedural pain anxiety . Objective : To assess whether use high-concentration continuous flow nitrous oxide addition standard management increase comfort level pediatric patient undergo minor procedure compare standard management alone . Methods : This prospective randomized control trial conduct JMC PED . Children 3-12 year age presenting PED , require minor procedure assess eligibility . Minor procedure define procedure standard management may involve provide local anesthetic and/or hold child order successfully accomplish procedure . These procedure patient would receive parenteral analgesic , anxiolytic anesthetic , minimally painful warrant potential risk associate parenteral anesthesia . Examples minor procedure include simple incision drainage abscess , intravenous catheter placement , urinary catheter placement , paronychia incision , foreign body removal simple laceration repair . A local anesthetic injectable lidocaine topical anesthetic Eutectic Mixture Local Anesthetics ( EMLA ) frequently use use discretion provider perform procedure . The dos topical anesthetic use uniform . The decision whether topical anesthesia use make provider group randomization patient . Exclusion criterion include patient medical condition nitrous oxide contraindicate , unable communicate reliable level pain low-to-no anxiety level demonstrable validate anxiety scale , score examining room research assistant procedure describe provider . After obtain parental consent/child assent , patient randomize use random number table group 1 ( nitrous oxide plus standard management ) group 2 ( standard management alone ) . Because young child especially experience significant anxiety procedure , negatively affect success procedure , use block randomization group 6 two separate age group order ensure equal representation group . These group divide preschool age ( 3 year &lt; 6 year ) school age ( &gt; 6 years- 12 year ) child . Patients nitrous oxide group receive nitrous oxide 70 % concentration use nitrous oxide protocol previously develop use PED ( attach ) , along standard management ( +/- local anesthetic , +/- hold child ) determine provider prior randomization . Patients Group 2 receive standard management alone ( +/-local anesthetic , +/- hold child ) . Data Collection : Data collection occur three time point : pre- procedure , intra-procedure post-procedure . The pre-procedural data collection include : 1 ) pain score use standard number scale range 0-10 child &gt; 6 year 10-point Wong-Baker face pain scale child &lt; 6 year measure time triage triage nurse 2 ) demographic include age , gender , procedure type , adjunctive pain medication ( include use local anesthesia ) anxiety score use Modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale ( M-YPAS ) perform research assistant ( medical student college student train data collection ) treatment room provider describe procedure patient parent . Intra-procedural data collection include : comfort score measure Face , Legs , Activity , Cry , Consolability ( FLACC ) Pain Scale anxiety score measure M-YPAS . The FLACC Scale 10 point score system 10 indicate high level pain . Both score scale validate scale pain ( FLACC ) anxiety ( M-YPAS ) . The FLACC score M-YPAS score document research assistant ( medical student college student train data collection ) . The post-procedure data collection include : mask tolerance , level hold child require order complete procedure , length procedure , high nitrous oxide concentration use , patient recovery time back-to-baseline , adverse event , independent rating success procedure provider perform procedure provider administer nitrous oxide . At end visit , research assistant blind patient 's group assignment document parent 's satisfaction encounter . Outcomes : The primary outcome FLACC Pain Scale score measure intra-procedure . Secondary outcome M-YPAS Anxiety Score , length procedure , parent satisfaction score , provider rating success procedure . To assess inter-relator reliability , second provider complete provider survey 75 % participant . Sample Size : Based pre-study sample child undergo minor procedure , mean FLAAC Pain Scale score 7.25/10 . We determine 25 % difference mean FLACC score two group would clinically relevant . In various publish article clinical significant change pain score note use nitrous oxide 20 % 40 % . At alpha .05 power 80 % , estimate sample size 42 patient arm ( 21 patient two age range per arm ) . Statistics : Data collect analyzed use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 19 FLACC Pain Scale primary outcome measure . The mean FLACC score compare two group . Ordinal variable analyze use Mann-Whitney -U test categorical value use Chi Square test . Associations intra-procedure FLACC Pain Scale score patient age ( preschool school age ) , pre-procedural pain pre-procedural anxiety score analyze use Spearman correlation Chi Square test . The kappa statistic use assess agreement two provider ' rating success procedure . Since randomization stratify sample size calculation base stratified analysis , analyze group separately test hypothesis . An interim review data do effectiveness treatment . Any adverse event report principal investigator write The Committee Clinical Investigations ( CCI ) institutional review board ( IRB ) . Additional Response : Although lack blinding may see potential weakness concern objectivity main outcome , intentionally blind study order mimic PED practice . Our goal determine whether nitrous oxide benefit child term reduce pain and/or anxiety minor procedure . The method delivery , however , may noxious child ( face mask ) . Introducing aspect standard arm may unduly increase FLACC Pain Scale score group . Additionally , sense may introduce noxious stimulus without possibility benefit seem unethical . In arm , administration local anesthetic and/or degree child hold order perform procedure discretion treat physician . The practice , however , specific minor procedure similar provider . For example , child receive suture topical anesthetic place triage injectable lidocaine administer time suture . The dos topical anesthetic uniform decision provider whether use topical anesthesia make group randomization . In order data clinically meaningful , want mimic PED practice . The detail aspects adjuvant care , local anesthetic use hold child , document . Risks : The adverse effect nitrous oxide occur infrequently . However , literature , follow adverse effect describe : vomiting , oxygen desaturation , dizziness , euphoria , abdominal pain hallucination . Benefits : The subject may may experience decrease pain anxiety level , potential short procedure time due compliance , increase parent/child satisfaction . A positive procedural experience may reduce long-term procedural traumatic distress .</detailed_description>
