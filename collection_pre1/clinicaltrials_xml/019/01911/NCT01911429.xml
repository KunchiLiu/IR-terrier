	<criteria>Written inform consent parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) sufficient intellectual capacity understand study support subject ' adherence study procedure must obtain subject emancipate . In accordance Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) requirement , subject complete inform assent prior study participation . Male female subject 13 17 year age , inclusive , time consent . DSMIVTR axis I primary diagnosis schizophrenia ( include disorganize ( 295.10 ) , paranoid ( 295.30 ) , undifferentiated ( 295.90 ) subtypes ) confirmation schizophrenia diagnosis adequately trained clinician time screening , mean Schedule Affective Disorders Schizophrenia Schoolage Children ( KSADSPL ) . PANSS total score ≥ 70 screen Baseline . CGIS ≥ 4 screen Baseline . Within 5th 95th percentile gender specific weightforage heightforage Growth Charts National Center Health Statistics . In good physical health basis medical history , physical examination , laboratory screening . Females participate study : unable become pregnant ( eg , premenarchal , surgically sterile , etc . ) ; OR practice true abstinence ( consistent lifestyle ) must agree remain abstinent signing informed consent least 30 day last dose study drug take ; OR sexually active willing use medically effective method birth control ( e.g. , male use condom female use condom , diaphragm , contraceptive sponge , spermicide , contraceptive pill , intrauterine device ) signing informed consent least 7 day last dose study drug take . Males must willing remain sexually abstinent ( consistent lifestyle ) use effective method birth control ( eg , male use condom female use condom , diaphragm , contraceptive sponge , spermicide , contraceptive pill , intrauterine device ) signing informed consent least 30 day last dose study drug take . In judgement clinician , subject acute exacerbation psychotic symptom ( longer 2 month duration ) mark deterioration function baseline ( history ) , subject hospitalize purpose treat acute psychotic exacerbation 2 consecutive week less immediately screen . In judgment investigator , subject able swallow size number study drug tablet specify per protocol . Willing able adhere protocolspecified meal requirement dose . Has Axis I Axis II diagnosis schizophrenia primary focus treatment within 3 month screen . Has history current diagnosis mental retardation , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , neurologic disorder , severe head trauma . Lifetime history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , history Hepatitis B C. Any following : Documented history chromosomal disorder developmental impairment ( ie , trisomy chromosome 21 ; 22q11 deletion syndrome ) . Evidence chronic organic disease CNS tumor , inflammation , active seizure disorder , vascular disorder , potential CNS relate disorder might occur childhood eg , Duchenne Muscular dystrophy , myasthenia gravis , neurologic serious neuromuscular disorder . In addition , subject must history persistent neurological symptom attributable serious head injury . Past history febrile seizure , druginduced seizure , alcohol withdrawal seizure exclusionary . PANSS total score ≥ 120 screen Baseline . Exhibits evidence moderate severe extrapyramidal symptom , dystonia , tardive dyskinesia , moderate severe movement disorder . Severity determine investigator . Lifetime history electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . Resistant antipsychotic treatment base least two different prior adequate trial ( ie , adequate dose duration ) antipsychotic agent within current episode schizophrenia . Clinically significant neurological , metabolic ( include type 1 diabetes ) , hepatic , renal , hematological , pulmonary , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , carcinoma , and/or urological disorder would pose risk subject participate study might confound result study . Note : Active medical condition minor wellcontrolled exclusionary affect risk subject study result . In case impact condition upon risk subject study result unclear , Medical Monitor consult . Any subject know cardiovascular disease condition ( even control ) must discuss Medical Monitor screening . Has history malignancy &lt; 5 year prior sign inform consent . Clinically significant finding ( ) physical examination determine investigator pose health concern subject study . Clinically relevant abnormal laboratory value abnormal vital sign values/findings . Note : If laboratory result outside normal range , site may subject retested . If upon retesting value remain outside normal range , significance value must discuss Medical Monitor enrollment consideration . A history presence abnormal ECG , investigator 's opinion clinically significant . Abnormal screen ECGs centrally overread , eligibility determine base overread . Presence history ( within last year ) medical surgical condition ( eg , gastrointestinal disease ) might interfere absorption , metabolism , excretion orally administer lurasidone . Clinically significant alcohol abuse/dependence drug abuse/dependence base DSMIVTR criterion within last 6 month prior screen . Positive test result screen Baseline : 1 . Urine drug abuse ( amphetamine , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cocaine , opiates , phencyclidine , cannabinoids , methadone ) . A positive test amphetamine , barbiturate , opiate , benzodiazepine methadone may result exclusion subject investigator determines positive test result take prescription medicine ( ) prescribe . In event subject test positive cannabinoids ( tetrahydrocannabinol ) alcohol , investigator evaluate subject 's ability abstain prohibit substance study . If investigator 's clinical judgment subject abstain , subject may enrol consultation Medical Monitor . 2 . Pregnancy test . Females pregnant , lactating , likely become pregnant study . Participated another interventional clinical trial receive investigational product within 30 day prior randomization . Donation whole blood within 60 day prior randomization . Known history presence clinically significant intolerance antipsychotic medication include limited angioedema , serotonin neuroleptic malignant syndrome . Clinically relevant history drug hypersensitivity lurasidone component formulation . Use concomitant medication consistently prolong QT/QTc interval within 28 day prior randomization . Received depot neuroleptic unless last injection least 1 month 1 treatment cycle prior screening , whichever longer . Received treatment antidepressant , stimulant , atomoxetine within 3 day prior randomization , fluoxetine hydrochloride within 21 day randomization , monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor within 28 day randomization , clozapine within 120 day randomization . Use antipsychotic medication ( study drug ) , carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , eslicarbazepine acetate , fluvoxamine , within 3 day prior randomization ( 7 day prior randomization aripiprazole ) followup .

Subject consider investigator imminent risk suicide injury self , others , property study . Subject history one serious suicide attempt ( base investigator 's judgment ) 3 month prior screen . Subjects determine risk suicide injury , assess investigator screening , refer psychiatric evaluation . Adhering special diet 28 day prior drug administration ( eg , liquid , protein , raw food diet ) . Subject plan move study , chronically homeless , unable attend plan study visit . The Medical Monitor consult individual case , need . Demonstrates decrease ( improvement ) &gt; 25 % PANSS score screen Baseline visit . Subject newly diagnose Type 2 diabetes screen . A subject Type 2 diabetes eligible study inclusion consider clinically stable , define : Random ( nonfasting ) screen glucose &lt; 200 mg/dl ( 11.1 mmol/L ) ; If ≥ 200 mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/L ) must retested fasted state .
