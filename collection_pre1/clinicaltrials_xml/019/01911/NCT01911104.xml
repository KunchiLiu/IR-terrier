	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES/ENDPOINTS 1 . The primary endpoint study maximal capacity mitochondrial ATP synthesis measure use 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . 2 . The principal secondary endpoint relationship exercise-induced change mitochondrial function vivo exercise mimetic-induced change mitochondrial function vitro . 3 . The principal tertiary endpoint relationship basal promoter methylation status key gene involve fuel metabolism know activated exercise skeletal muscle tissue cell exercise-induced response mitochondrial function . As exercise array metabolic effect , well position cutting-edge methodology Translational Research Institute ( TRI ) , also measure whole body insulin sensitivity metabolic flexibility hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp , substrate oxidation energy expenditure whole room calorimeter/metabolic chamber intramyocellular lipid content .</detailed_description>
