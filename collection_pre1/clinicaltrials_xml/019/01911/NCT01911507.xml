	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose INC280 ( c-Met inhibitor INCB028060 ) plus erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) patient meet proto-oncogene ( MET ) express non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity profile INC280 plus erlotinib . II . To determine preliminary efficacy INC280 plus erlotinib . III . To characterize pharmacokinetic behavior combination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect blood tumor sample exploratory analysis MET epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive c-Met inhibitor INCB028060 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
