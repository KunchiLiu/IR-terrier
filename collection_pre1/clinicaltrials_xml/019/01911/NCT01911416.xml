	<criteria>Age 18 year old Histologically document diagnosis pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Patients resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma borderline resectable disease neoadjuvant treatment consider appropriate candidate resection ECOG Performance Status 02 Patients adequate bone marrow , liver renal function , specify : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dL Platelets ≥ 80 x 109/L Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present Plasma creatine phosphokinase ( CK ) &lt; 1.5 x ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 24hour clearance ≥ 50ml/min Written inform consent obtain prior study specific screening procedure Patients major surgery within 4 week initiation study medication . Patients concurrent uncontrolled medical condition may interfere participation study potentially affect interpretation study data . Patients unable take oral drug lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract know malabsorption syndrome . Patients previously treat systemic LDE225 Hh pathway inhibitor . ) Patients neuromuscular disorder ( e.g . inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug recognize cause rhabdomyolysis , HMG CoA inhibitor ( statin ) , clofibrate gemfibrozil , discontinue least 2 week prior start LDE225 treatment . If essential patient stay statin control hyperlididemia , pravastatin may use extra caution . b ) Patients plan embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . NB : Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid whilst LDE225 treatment . Patients take part experimental drug study within 4 week initiate treatment LDE225 . Patients receive antineoplastic therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , target therapy radiotherapy ) concurrently within 2 week start treatment LDE225 . Patients receive treatment medication know moderate strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index , discontinue start treatment LDE225 . Medications strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day strong CYP3A/5 inducer least 2 week prior start treatment LDE225 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , include woman whose career , lifestyle , sexual orientation precludes intercourse male partner woman whose partner sterilize vasectomy mean , UNLESS use two birth control method . The two method double barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method . Adequate barrier method contraception include : • Diaphragm , condom ( partner ) , intrauterine device ( copper hormonal ) , sponge spermicide . Hormonal contraceptive include market contraceptive agent include estrogen and/or progestational agent . Reliable contraception maintain throughout study 3 month study drug discontinuation . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol . Patients candidate undergo laparoscopic examination biopsy</criteria>
