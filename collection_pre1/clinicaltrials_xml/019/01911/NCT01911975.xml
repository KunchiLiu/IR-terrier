	<detailed_description>Indication Lacosamide functionalized amino acid antinociceptive property inflammatory neuropathic pain , display unique mechanism : enhances slow inactivation Nav1.3 , Nav1.7 , Nav1.8 . Rationale A significant body evidence implicate sodium channel mediate pathophysiological component neuropathic nociceptive pain . This support clinical evidence suggest local anaesthetic , anticonvulsant tricyclic compound block voltage-gated sodium channel may act useful therapeutic manage treat pain . The use sodium channel blocker , however , limited lack selectivity different sodium channel subtypes often additional central nervous system ( CNS ) cardiovascular side effect . Therefore , key improvement limitation exist sodium channel blocker selectively target involve pain mechanism whilst spar channel involve cardiovascular function . Nav1.7 express predominantly nociceptive sympathetic neuron . The role channel nociceptive neuron characterize human genetics , indicate essential non-redundant role pain transduction conduction follow noxious stimulus . Gain-of-function mutation describe Nav1.7 result extreme pain disorder inherit erythromelalgia ( IEM ) , paroxysmal extreme pain disorder ( PEPD ) SCN9A-associated small fiber neuropathy . In disease state genetically link gain-of-function Nav1.7 , channel mutate increase sodium influx result hyperexcitable sensory neuron , resultant sensation pain . Lacosamide functionalized aminoacid synthesize development anticonvulsant drug candidate display antinociceptive property inflammatory neuropathic pain . Lacosamide display unique mechanism action seemingly selectively stabilizes channel slow- inactivated state . Lacosamide inhibit current Nav1.3 , Nav1.7 , Nav1.8 , prolong depolarization , consistent enhancement slow-inactivation effect fast inactivation . Furthermore , lacosamide well able discriminate resting inactivated channel compare lidocaine carbamazepine , thus likely allow improved selectivity neuron depolarize membrane potential , little tonic block . Small fiber neuropathy ( SFN ) relatively common disorder peripheral nerve , primarily affect small somatic fiber , autonomic fiber , . In proportion patient SFN , underlie cause identify ; case term idiopathic SFN . Gain-of-function mutation SCN9A recently report present 28 % patient idiopathic SFN , suggest underlying genetic basis proportion patient disease . Electrophysiological analysis demonstrate multiple gain-of-function change mutant channel mutation result hyperexcitability dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neuron . Moreover , mutation show impaired slow inactivation Nav1.7 , find provide rationale evaluate possible pain reduction potential lacosamide condition . Study Rationale Objectives The objective study determine efficacy safety lacosamide , sodium channel blocker , patient pain due SCN9A-associated SFN . The propose study plan recruit patient clinically diagnose SFN , mutation SCN9A confirm genetically , possible , demonstrate functional testing , cause hyperexcitability DRG neuron . This small , precision medicine population provide opportunity evaluate efficacy safety lacosamide treatment pain due SCN9A-associated SFN .</detailed_description>

Where possible , vitro confirmation functionality mutation perform document . 4 . Presence pain due SFN least 3 month prior Screening average selfreported pain score least 3 time . 5 . If analgesic medication manage pain due SFN , subject must stable analgesic medication minimum 30 day prior start study continue regimen throughout study . 6 . Evidence personally sign date informed consent document indicate subject ( legal representative ) inform pertinent aspect study . 7 . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 1 . Subjects predominantly sign large nerve fiber involvement , clinically significant abnormal nerve conduction study . 2 . History presence illness know cause SFN ( exclude diabetes mellitus ) . 3 . Subjects severe pain condition may impair selfassessment pain due SFN . 4 . Any condition possibly affect drug intake absorption . 5 . History known alcohol , analgesic illicit drug abuse within 12 month Screening . 6 . Subjects take medication activity sodium channel . These medication prohibit end study period require washout period least 5 half life ( 90 day capsaicin patch ) prior Screening visit . 7 . 12lead ECG demonstrate QTcF ( Fridericia 's correction ) &gt; 450 QRS interval &gt; 120 msec Screening . If QTcF exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTcF value use determine subject 's eligibility . 8 . Severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance â‰¤ 30 mL/min ) . 9 . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives precede first dose study medication . 10 .
