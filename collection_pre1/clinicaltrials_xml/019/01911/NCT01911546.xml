	<brief_summary>A grow number patient kidney transplant wait list broadly human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) sensitize ( HS ) . These patient unlikely compatible donor . Therefore wait longer increase morbidity mortality . Desensitization intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) rituximab alemtuzumab induction improve transplant rate achieves good allograft outcome . However , HS patient risk viral infection transplant . We previously show increased incidence BKV infection desensitization HS patient higher peak viral load . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) polyomavirus BK ( BKV ) infection place HS renal transplant recipient particular risk . Allograft rejection associate CMV BKV infection . This particular concern HS patient increase risk rejection baseline . Furthermore , frequent development leukopenia transplantation often require CMV prophylactic agent discontinue along lower immunosuppression . This increase risk CMV infection allograft rejection . Everolimus approve rejection prophylaxis combination calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) . CNI use study lead drug 's approval cyclosporine . There several trial near 's completion utilize low dose tacrolimus instead . In 2012 Novartis publish data several trial show superior outcome use everolimus + low dose tacrolimus . This combination currently approve EU . It also combination standard care ( SOC ) center patient everolimus . This study aim demonstrate use everolimus part maintenance immunosuppression regimen may decrease viral infection without lower overall immunosuppression thus improve allograft function survival .</brief_summary>
