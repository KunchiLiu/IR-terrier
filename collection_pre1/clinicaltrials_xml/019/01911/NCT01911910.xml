	<brief_summary>Diseases heart blood vessel , heart attack stroke , common lead severe disability death . Changes body leading heart attack stroke usually develop decade result smoking , diet , lack exercise , obesity , diabetes high blood pressure . Changes lifestyle diet significantly reduce risk heart diseases . General Practitioners invite 40 74 year-olds know heart disease take part NHS Health Check , measure person 's individual risk develop heart attack stroke encourages face-to-face meeting take part programme help give smoking , lose weight etc . necessary . In new clinical trial investigator test whether computer-tailored electronic ( e ) -coaching via email internet help people make necessary change lifestyle reduce risk heart attack stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart Attack Prevention Programme You London ( HAPPY London ) conduct randomise control trial comparing use tailor e-coaching addition standard care vs. standard care alone . Standard care define care would offer NHS Health Check programme NHS primary care . We use range establish novel cardiovascular marker determine clinical cost effectiveness e-coaching gain pathophysiological insight lifestyle modification affect cardiovascular system . These measure include cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) , aortic stiffness parameter , vascular ultrasound biomarkers CV disease risk . Intervention The HAPPY London web-based tool provide participant individualise score lifestyle 10 year CV risk score , base modify Framingham score UK specific QRisk Score , provide tailored advice education suboptimal factor . Ideal target set information update 3 6 month allow participant view progress . Weekly email brief health lifestyle advice send encourage healthy behaviour base clinical study topical issue medium . Links social network , Facebook post ability allow choose 'buddies ' family friend view progress aim encourage healthy behaviour . The study involve recruitment 400 adult age 40 74 year moderate high 10-year CV risk score ( Estimated 10 year CV risk &gt; 10 % ) . Half study group receive use e-coaching addition standard care allocate randomly stratify accord either moderate ( QRisk 10 20 % ) high risk ( QRisk equal 20 % ) . The initial screen take place www.happylondon.info web-based 'mini-check ' questionnaire . Potential participant see physical screen visit confirm eligibility . 3 subsequent visit take place 6 month ; baseline , 3 month 6 month follow . A subgroup study population ( 65 intervention arm thus total 130 participant ) also baseline follow cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) imaging . Assessment perform use variety measure questionnaire , blood pressure ( BP ) check , blood test , ultrasound scan , oscillometric method ass pulse wave velocity pulse wave analysis CMR multi-parametric scanning . The primary aim study assess clinical effectiveness individualise , continuous electronic ( e- ) coach support healthy lifestyle primary prevention tool reduce CV risk improve quality life asymptomatic individual intermediate high 10 year CV risk . Other question aim answer : 1 . Is computer-tailored e-coaching cost-effective short-term ( clinical trial period ) long-term ( decision analysis model ) 2 . What associations personality trait , economic preference , sociocultural factor achieve lifestyle modification change cardiovascular phenotype ? 3 . What relationship change observe marker derive multi-parametric cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging protocol follow lifestyle change ? 4 . How frequent silent myocardial infarction typical NHS Health Check population ? 5 . Do treatment effect differ ethnic group ?</detailed_description>
