	<brief_summary>Hip replacement surgery one common elective surgery Canada surgery , considerable pain operation . By decrease amount pain surgery , patient may able move walk quicker , result easy physiotherapy session , short hospital stay may help avoid adverse outcome like nausea vomit overly sedate . By use ultrasound guide femoral nerve block , may alternative pain management minimal side effect patient hip replacement surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ultrasound guide femoral block study since late 90 's . A study publish 1997 Marhofer et al . point ultrasound guidance 3-in-1 block ( femoral , obturator , lateral cutaneous nerve ) , improve quality sensory block reduce onset time compare nerve-stimulation technique patient undergo hip surgery trauma . ( 13 ) In meta-analysis comparing ultrasound guidance versus electrical nerve-stimulation peripheral nerve block , author report decreased risk block failure , short procedure time faster onset time ultrasound use . ( 14 ) A systematic review study outcome Total Hip Arthroplasty conclude compare systemic analgesia use femoral nerve block unclear benefit . ( 15 ) Separate analysis two study include show Biboulet study , ultrasound use perform block , pain activity evaluate first 24 hour surgery , time maximum benefit block observe . ( 16 ) In second study Singelyn et al . continuous femoral nerve block , author find similar pain relief IV Patient Controlled Analgesia morphine few side effect . ( 17 ) While recent publication demonstrate analgesia effectiveness femoral nerve block fascia iliaca block hip fracture , ( 18 ) reference literature analyze effectiveness single shot , ultrasound-guided , femoral nerve block primary hip arthroplasty . This fact open possibility continue research analgesic effectiveness block population option handle postoperative pain limit widely side effect together use anticoagulant anti-thrombotic therapy . This technique consider simple procedure , easy teach learn . If study show improvement outcome , feasible incorporate block alternative pain management primary hip arthroplasty . Given complexity propose randomized-controlled trial , pilot study deem necessary find feasibility safety intervention , rate patient recruitment need additional personnel .</detailed_description>
