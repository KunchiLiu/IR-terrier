	<brief_title>Identification Novel Skeletal Muscle-derived Factors That Promote Lipid Oxidation ( Columbus )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : 1 . To identify specific change messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) /micro ribonucleic acid ( miRNA ) expression muscle associate high lower relative measure mitochondrial capacity fat oxidation . 2 . To identify secreted factors/miRNAs specifically relate metabolic response muscle present single initial bout exercise . 3 . To collect appropriate clinical sample ( muscle adipose tissue , plasma/serum ) enable validation myokines associate change oxygen consumption/mitochondrial content via vivo vitro discovery effort .</detailed_description>
