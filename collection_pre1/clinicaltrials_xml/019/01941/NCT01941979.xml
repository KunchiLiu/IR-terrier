	<brief_summary>Surgery indicate curative treatment rectal cancer disease diagnose early , however local recurrence risk increase disease diagnose advanced stage.T1-2 tumor recurrence rate lower 10 % , T3N0 tumors 15 % - 35 % positive lymph node T3-4 45 % 67 % recurrence rate within 5 year . These data indicate patient high risk tumor recurrence receive adjuvant therapy treatment . It possible adjuvant chemotherapy positive impact survival patient already treat neoadjuvant combination therapy . However necessary identify patient might benefit . An exploratory analysis European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) 22921 study show addition adjuvant chemotherapy benefit group patient reduction tumor stage ypT0-2 . In group reduction ( ypT3-4 ) , benefit . Retrospective analyzes suggest response neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy predictor prognosis even benefit adjuvant chemotherapy . However benefit adjuvant chemotherapy patient rectal cancer remain controversial . Therefore , randomize trial need answer question . Based data investigator propose phase III study , randomize , unblinded , adjuvant chemotherapy base Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) Oxaliplatin versus observation patient rectal adenocarcinoma T3-4 , N0-1 , M0 previously treat neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy present complete response . The investigator believe subgroup patient , achieve complete response , benefit adjuvant therapy . Study objective : The main objective study verify adjuvant chemotherapy 5-FU oxaliplatin , 4 month , increase recurrence-free survival versus observation . Secondary objective include evaluation toxicity , overall survival assessment biomarkers ( study protocol separately ) . The study 's primary endpoint disease-free survival ( DFS ) define time randomization radiological detection distant disease / locoregional recurrence . Isolate carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) increase consider recurrence new measurable lesion find . NOTE : The TNM system base size and/or extent ( reach ) primary tumor ( T ) , amount spread nearby lymph node ( N ) , presence metastasis ( M ) secondary tumor form spread cancer cell part body .</brief_summary>
