	<brief_title>Does Tympanometry Predict Antibiotic Usage Acute Otitis Media ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Acute Otitis Media ( AOM ) common childhood infection antibiotic prescribe . { 1-2 } Several important factor alter prescription practice AOM past decade . North America see epidemic microbial resistance , attributable large part over-prescription antibiotic . { 3-4 } Evidence show AOM commonly diagnose antibiotic prescribe unnecessarily . { 5-7 } In addition number study compare antibiotic treatment placebo , although prove superiority antibiotic treatment , high rate resolution placebo . A meta analysis 7 RCT 's show 73 % success rate Amoxicillin versus 60 % placebo . { 8 } These result prompt interest watch wait strategy treatment AOM child 6 month 10 year age . Three important study perform assess outcomes delay antibiotic 48-72H , two primary care { 9-10 } one pediatric emergency department . { 11 } All three show difference outcomes 2-4 week follow-up . There significant reduction antibiotic usage watch wait approach , reduction 70 % . These study lead American Academy Pediatrics Canadian Pediatric Society recommend adopt conservative non-antibiotic treatment strategy AOM first 48-72H . { 12 } However early 2011 , 2 paper publish suggest antibiotic use AOM beneficial . { 13 , 14 } What set two paper apart paper definition acute otitis medium : one study child enrol study clinician otoscopists successfully complete otoscopic validation program , second study middle ear fluid present mean pneumatic otoscopy . The question arise , treatment otitis medium really question concern treatment , question diagnosis ? The publish correspondence two paper generate , suggest diagnosis AOM indeed concern . A technique name tympanometry could prove useful . Tympanometry well establish technique documentation middle ear effusion . Tympanometry measure compliance tympanic membrane range pressure . A graphic curve generate compare normal example pathologic condition . Primary care physician use technique successfully among child without diagnosis AOM . { 15 } Two study involve tympanometry otitis medium { 16-17 } show tympanograms consistent clear middle ear effusion ( Type B ) 50-60 % patient clinically diagnose AOM . This strongly suggest AOM diagnose ! Interestingly Spiro et al show rate antibiotic prescription different physician aware tympanogram result blind . This indicate lack knowledge around impact outcome initial tympanogram . Currently Stollery , ( suggest CPS AMA ) well child diagnose AOM give prescription antibiotic , tell wait 48 hour fill , expectation many child complete resolution symptom . They encourage take analgesic keep comfortable . However , current state knowledge indicate antibiotic provide superior symptom control first 24-48H provide superior resolution rate placebo clinically diagnose AOM . The delayed antibiotic strategy similar long term outcomes immediate antibiotic treatment . It clear patient middle ear effusion document adjunctive test , tympanometry represent distinctly different group diagnose observation tympanic membrane . Spiro 's study indicate physician know therefore change practice basis tympanogram result . This bring u investigator ' primary research question . Are child age 6 month 16 year attend Stollery Emergency Department diagnose AOM ( sent home conservative management ) likely fill prescription antibiotic next 7 day tympanogram type B rather type A C ? The investigator propose observational study , within watch wait strategy , determine patient clinically diagnose AOM type B tympanogram high rate eventual antibiotic usage . Secondary outcome measure would include symptom pain , fever impaired sleep without clear evidence middle ear effusion . If patient B type tympanogram high rate eventual antibiotic usage , delay treatment significantly reduce overall antibiotic usage . Furthermore , investigator could reduce pain suffer patient first 48-72 hour . The corollary may patient tympanogram pattern may comparatively low need antibiotic . This study would help accurately identify patient likely derive significant benefit antibiotic treatment AOM . PROJECT DESIGN AND WORK PLAN Design : The study non-interventional analysis outcome . This observational cohort study . Intervention sample method : All patient diagnose OM approach study enrolment within hour RA available . Tympanometry conduct every participant ears . The clinician privy result tympanogram . The tympanograms assign B A/C shape , upon review principle investigator . In case disagreement third reviewer review tympanogram . Patients follow phone call 3 day 8 day . They ask rate symptom ( Acute Otitis Media-Severity Symptom Scale ) { 18 } , addition specific script interview question study ( development ) include determination antibiotic usage infection . The investigator also review provincial pharmacy database confirm antibiotic prescription fill . Training : Research assistant receive one-on-one training principal investigator tympanography technique . Recruitment : Updates regard study occur monthly staff meeting , poster describe study also place throughout ED . Research Assistants visible department remind staff study . Primary Outcome : Are child age 6 month 16 year attend Stollery Emergency Department diagnose AOM ( sent home conservative management ) likely fill prescription antibiotic next 7 day tympanogram type B rather type A C ? Secondary Outcomes : Does type B tympanometry curve predict increase ( 1 ) Reported Pain ( 2 ) Analgesic use ( 3 ) Fever ( 4 ) Sleep Disturbance ( 5 ) Oral intake versus type A/C tympanograms ( 6 ) Proportion patient diagnose OM either type A type A C tympanograms . Sample Size : A logistic regression perform use antibiotic use 7 day dependent variable . Given 4 independent variable , investigator need least 40 ( 80 would ideal ) subject fill antibiotic prescription . Enrolling 137 patient would give u alpha Beta 0.05 , would allow u Chi Squared test look two two table Antibiotic ( Yes No ) vs Tympanometry Graph ( Type B v ) . Analysis : Antibiotic use 7 day follow enrolment analyze logistic regression . Independent variable include age , Tympanogram type A/C , Viral upper respiratory symptom â‰¥ 5days prior presentation ED , pain require analgesia Emergency home within 6H presentation . Quantitative qualitative data describe . Antibiotic drug data check NetCare see discrepancy verbal report NetCare . Feasibility : Data investigator ' emergency department indicate 900 child per year present AOM , past 6 month winter ( Oct-Mar ) 540 . Based previous result { 9-11 } investigator predict antibiotic usage rate 30 % . To collect 40 patient fill prescription antibiotic investigator need 135 patient otitis . If antibiotic usage rate higher number decrease . Accounting 15 % drop rate investigator need enroll 155 child . Conservatively assume recruitment 30 % child AOM investigator anticipate 24 week reach investigator ' sample size .</detailed_description>
