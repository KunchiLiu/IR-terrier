	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine induce immune response patient central nervous system tumor . Studying sample blood laboratory patient receive trivalent influenza vaccine may help doctor learn effect trivalent influenza vaccine cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Trivalent Influenza Vaccine Inducing Immune Response Patients With Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate immunogenicity high-dose influenza vaccination patient central nervous system tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess geometric mean titer ( GMT ) patient administration high-dose influenza vaccination compare previously determine geometric mean titer ( GMT ) among 38 patient receive standard yearly influenza vaccination . II . To assess seroconversion rate ( i.e . four-fold rise titer ) compare previously determine seroconversion follow administration standard yearly influenza vaccination . III . To assess seroprotection rate ( i.e . post-vaccination titer &gt; = 1:40 ) compare previously determine seroconversion seroprotection follow administration standard yearly influenza vaccination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relationship serologic marker immune function response high-dose vaccination . OUTLINE : Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine day 1 . After completion study , patient follow 28 day and/or 3 month .</detailed_description>
