	<brief_title>Short-Infusion Ziv-aflibercept Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility short infusion 30 minute 15 minute standard dose ziv-aflibercept combine FOLFIRI ( folinic acid [ leucovorin calcium ] , fluorouracil , irinotecan [ irinotecan hydrochloride ] ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe institutional safety experience combination use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4 toxicity grading . OUTLINE : Patients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously ( IV ) 15-30 minute follow FOLFIFRI chemotherapy comprise leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
