	<brief_summary>This multicenter phase II clinical study trametinib combination GSK2141795 patient BRAF wild-type mutation melanoma . All patient receive continuous dose trametinib ( 2 mg ) combination GSK2141795 ( 25 mg ) oral daily progression disease , withdrawal consent , development intolerable treatment associate toxicity . Imaging ( CT MRI ) perform within 7 day prior day 1 Odd Cycles , start Cycle 3 . Patients may continue treatment trametinib combination GSK2141795 trial disease progression development unacceptable toxicity improve maximal supportive care dose reduction per protocol . Treatment-associated adverse event assess base clinical laboratory finding use Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 . Adverse event assessment perform every week cycle 3 day 1 , day 1 every cycle thereafter . AEs SAEs monitor UCSF 's Data Safety Monitoring Committee . Safety assessment include medical history , physical examination , CBC differential , chemistry panel , thyroid function pregnancy test , ECGs , ophthalmology evaluation . Screening assessment also include transthoracic echocardiogram MUGA scan , brain imaging . It estimate 48 patient complete study .</brief_summary>
