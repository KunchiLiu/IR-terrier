	<brief_summary>Patients undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery often experience range problem symptom related procedure underlie heart disease . These problem include anxiety depressive symptom , immobility issue , complication wound seeping , neck shoulder pain , interrupt insufficient sleep . Over last 2 decade , cardiac rehabilitation become recognize significant component continuum care person cardiovascular disease . Furthermore , cardiac rehabilitation undergone significant evolution move focus exercise intervention comprehensive disease management program . In Guidelines Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery cardiac rehabilitation describe include early ambulation hospitalisation , outpatient prescriptive exercise training begin 6-8 week follow surgery . Our hypothesis physical exercise moderate intensity psycho-educative component part cardiac rehabilitation begin early postoperatively hospitalise . Results study phase 1 rehabilitation coronary artery bypass graft surgery patient promise . However , randomise trial conduct , evidence therefore lack . The objective pilot trial investigate effect phase 1 comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme consist psycho-educative component , exercise-training component include pulmonary training , cycling , neck shoulder exercise , combination plus treatment usual treatment usual patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting . SheppHeartCABG investigator-initiated 2 x 2 factorial randomise clinical pilot trial blind outcome assessment . Recruitment one site 1:1:1:1 central randomisation phase 1 rehabilitation ; 1 ) exercise-training plus usual care , 2 ) psycho-educative plus usual care 3 ) exercise-training psycho-educative plus usual , 4 ) usual care alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The explorative outcome measure consist two part : physical capacity mental physical health . Physical capacity measure peak VO2 max 6 minute ' walk test discharge 4 week follow surgery . Perceived mental physical health measure Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) admission , discharge 4 week follow surgery . Furthermore questionnaire measure anxiety depression ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) , health-related quality life ( HeartQoL ) , fatigue ( MFI-20 ) cognitive emotional representation illness ( B-IPQ ) , physical activity ( IPAQ ) , self-rated health ( EQ-5D ) , sleep ( PSQI ) pain ( Ã–MPSQ )</detailed_description>
