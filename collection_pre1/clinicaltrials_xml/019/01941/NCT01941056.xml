	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vaccine therapy healthy volunteer without previous exposure cytomegalovirus . Vaccines make gene-modified virus may help body build immune response may help prevent cytomegalovirus infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Healthy Volunteers With Without Previous Exposure Cytomegalovirus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish biological optimal dose cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) -modified vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) Triplex vaccine ( multi-CMV epitope modify vaccinia Ankara vaccine ) . II . To determine vaccine safe well tolerate healthy volunteer dos . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To provide preliminary evidence CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine drive expansion CMV-specific immune response would support evaluation vaccine hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) recipient . II . To confer CMV-specific immunity CMV-negative volunteer determine duration immune enhancement CMV-specific cell mediate immunity ( CMI ) function 12 month follow immunization healthy volunteer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Participants receive multi-CMV epitope modify vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) follow booster injection 28 day later absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , participant follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
