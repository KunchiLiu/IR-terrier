	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 ) Determine effect 4-weeks high intensity interval training ( HIIT ) free acid form β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate ( HMB-FA ) VO2peak , lactate threshold , critical power , anaerobic work capacity neuromuscular economy population endurance trained individual . 2 ) Determine effect 4-weeks HIIT HMB-FA change skeletal muscle physiological cross-sectional area ( PCSA=Volume/Fascicle length ) muscle quality ( MQ=echo intensity ) rectus femoris vastus lateralis . Subjects : Fifty male female age 18 - 35 recruited participate study . Subject randomize one three group : control group ( CTL ) , HIIT group ( HIIT ) group take amino acid metabolite HMB perform HIIT ( HMB-HIIT ) . Individuals assign CTL undergo baseline test . They ask continue normal exercise routine 4 week undergo post-testing time period . Study Protocol : Two test session , nonconsecutive day , occur least 72 hour prior start train period . The testing protocol repeat end 4-week training period . Testing protocol include performance testing ( VO2peak , lactate threshold , critical power , anaerobic work capacity neuromuscular economy ) anthropometric measure ( physiological cross-sectional area muscle quality ) . The training protocol individual experimental group consist 4-weeks high intensity interval training three session per week electronically brake cycle ergometer . Individual work -loads calculate base outcome participant 's preliminary testing .</brief_summary>
