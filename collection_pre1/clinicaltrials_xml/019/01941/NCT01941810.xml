	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation ( bovine lactoferrin supplement ) self-reported taste smell disturbance cancer patient receive chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation baseline lipid peroxidation byproduct saliva cancer patient measure thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ( TBARs ) assay . II . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation ability cancer patient generate increase lipid peroxidation byproduct challenge weak iron-containing solution . III . To assess impact lactoferrin supplementation self-reported general quality life specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issue cancer patient establish chemotherapy-induced taste disturbance . IV . To assess incidence vitamin D deficiency cancer patient chemotherapy induced taste change . OUTLINE : Patients receive bovine lactoferrin supplement orally ( PO ) three time daily ( TID ) 1 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week 1 month .</detailed_description>
