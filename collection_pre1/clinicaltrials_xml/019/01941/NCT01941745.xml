	<brief_title>Efficacy Recombinant Human Clara Cell 10 Protein ( rhCC10 ) Administered Premature Neonates With Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recombinant human CC10 protein ( rhCC10 ) novel therapeutic agent use prevent development chronic respiratory morbidity ( CRM ; repeat respiratory infection , asthma , re-hospitalizations ) preterm infant . Native CC10 natural anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory factor produce Clara Cells lung abundant protein respiratory mucosa . Animal data demonstrate single intratracheal dose rhCC10 administer shortly birth reduces lung inflammation ( important biomarkers link lung injury preterm infant ) , promote normal lung development , preserve lung architecture , improve pulmonary function , suppress response endotoxin enhances resistance pulmonary infection . In preterm infant die develop lung inflammation subsequent bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) , concentration activity CC10 significantly reduce indicate CC10 essential preventing lung injury promote normal lung development . In small phase I study , rhCC10 significantly decrease several index pulmonary inflammation lung premature infant risk develop BPD associate CRM . The drug appear safe , well-tolerated , reduce risk re-hospitalization due respiratory illness 9-10 month single intratracheal dose time birth ( 0/11 rhCC10-treated infant vs. 3/6 placebo-treated ) . This support protective role rhCC10 damage hyperoxia , mechanical ventilation , inflammation , infection immature lung . A normal airway epithelium produce significantly endogenous CC10 , factor contribute enhance resistance infection , less asthma , improve long-term respiratory outcome . We propose conduct Phase 2 clinical trial evaluate rhCC10 extremely premature infant ( &lt; 29 week gestation ) prevention BPD CRM . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled dose escalation study 88 premature infant . A single intratracheal dose study drug ( rhCC10 placebo ) administer preterm infant receive surfactant mechanical ventilation treatment RDS . Infants follow evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics , short long term efficacy approach . Safety evaluate serious adverse event ( SAE ) adverse event monitoring Bayley neurodevelopmental assessment 18 month correct gestational age ( CGA ) . Efficacy measurement include primary combined endpoint alive without evidence CRM 12 month CGA ( define parental diary pulmonary questionnaire ) compare rhCC10 treat placebo control . The availability therapy prevents lung injury , promote lung development , prevents serious respiratory infection asthma high risk preterm infant would highly significant advancement care .</detailed_description>
