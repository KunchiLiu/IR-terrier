	<brief_summary>As one center , MAASTRO also aggressively re-treats patient recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . Even primary radical treatment high dos , re-irradiation ( concurrent chemotherapy ) also give curative intent , thus use high dos radiation .

	<brief_title>Analysis Treatment Outcome Toxicity Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Wither-irradiated High Dose Recurrent Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MAASTRO clinic leader ( individual ) management patient lung cancer . This result major publication past individualized ( chemo ) radiotherapy ( NSCLC ) [ van Baardwijk 2006 2010 ] . As one center , MAASTRO also aggressively re-treats patient recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . Even primary radical treatment high dos , re-irradiation also give curative intent , thus use high dos radiation . Publications topic rare . Most report address result palliative re-irradiation NSCLC [ Ebara 2007 , Jackson 1987 , Montebello 1993 , Tada 2005 ] . The one available re-irradiation curative intent use outdated technique [ Okamoto 2002 , Wu 2003 ] . Only one recent publication analyze result 37 NSCLC patient 9 re-irradiated least 50 Gy use helical tomotherapy [ Kruser press ] . The result radical re-irradiation apply highly conformal radiation technique within MAASTRO unknown . This study provide knowledge benefit risk therapeutic approach . Furthermore , may provide enough evidence initiate Phase II/III clinical trial re-irradiation NSCLC patient curative intent .</detailed_description>
