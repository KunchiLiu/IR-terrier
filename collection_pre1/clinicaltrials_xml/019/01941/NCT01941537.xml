	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) common inflammatory skin disorder adversely affect aspect everyday life majority patient . It prevalence 3-4 % adult 25 % among child . AD complex pathogenesis , characterize : 1 ) immune activation increase number T-cells , dendritic cell ( DCs ) , increased expression inflammatory molecule 2 ) mark epidermal hyperplasia chronic diseased skin , 3 ) defective barrier function increase trans-epidermal water loss ( TEWL ) decrease lipid , reflect underlying alteration keratinocyte differentiation . AD predominantly Th2 ( IL-4 , IL-13 , IL-31 ) disease , recently also find `` T22 '' ( IL-22 ) polarize disease . ILV-094 anti IL-22 antibody therefore reverse immune activation AD . This study do assess safety , tolerability , clinical efficacy , mechanism action ILV-094 patient AD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Placebo Controlled Study Determine Safety , Pharmacodynamics Efficacy ILV-094 Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , study six IV infusion ILV-094 administer subject atopic dermatitis . Sixty subject randomly assign 2:1 ratio one two treatment arm ( ILV-094 v placebo ) . Forty patient enrol ILV-094 treatment arm 20 placebo-treatment arm , accordingly . A loading IV dose 600 mg ILV-094 placebo give baseline ( Day 0 ) , follow five additional IV dose 300 mg ILV-094 placebo every two week ( Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 ) . We continue follow patient every two week additional 10 week last IV dose ( 20 week post baseline ) .</detailed_description>

Category 2 : Systemic Steroids and/or Phototherapy . Category 3 : Cyclosporine and/or Other Immunomodulators ( Methotrexate , CellCept , Immuran ) . Women childbearing potential must test negative pregnancy agree use birth control measure highly effective . Are PPD negative time screen . Willingness avoid alcohol intake 48 hour visit study drug receive , order avoid increase liver function test ( LFTs ) ( exclusion ILV094 study order guard increase LFTs due alcohol intake attributed study drug ) . History active latent serious infection ( TB , granulomatous disorder histoplasmosis , coccidioidomycosis , etc ) . Skin colonization Staph . aureus expect high percentage atopic patient active disease consider exclusion criterion . Have know malignancy history malignancy ( except basal squamous cell carcinoma completely excise without evidence recurrence treat carcinoma situ cervix ) lymphoproliferative disease Have nontuberculous mycobacterial infection opportunistic systemic infection ( e.g. , Pneumocystis carinii , aspergillosis ) within 6 month prior screen . Have positive HIV history POCT screen visit . Have document current active hepatitis B ( surface antigen positive asymptomatic chronic carrier ) history hepatitis C infection ( antiHCV positive ) , history and/or screen test . Have history substance abuse ( drug alcohol ) within past year screening . Have serious concomitant illness could require use systemic corticosteroid otherwise interfere patient 's participation trial . Pregnant woman woman breast feeding plan breast feed . Evidence acute unstable clinically significant disease unstable serious disorder require active frequent monitoring . Evidence concomitant skin condition ( eg , psoriasis , lupus erythematosus ) atopic dermatitis would interfere evaluation effect study medication atopic dermatitis .
