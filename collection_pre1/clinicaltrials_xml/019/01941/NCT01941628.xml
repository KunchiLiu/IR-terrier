	<brief_summary>Cesarean delivery general anesthesia one surgical procedure , important factor safety speed surgery , newborn adaptation strongly depend time induction general anesthesia ( administration anesthetic ) pennywort ligation . The short possible interval essential amount anesthetic cross placenta fetal circulation . The primary objective : To compare surgical condition fetus delivery Cesarean section general anesthesia deep neuromuscular blockade versus standard procedure succinylcholine . The primary safety objective : To compare influence different level neuromuscular blockade surgical condition newborn adaptation Cesarean delivery . The secondary objective : To compare influence deep versus no/shallow muscle blockade entire Cesarean section surgical condition suture uterus abdominal wall attention blood loss , time surgery surgical complication . To describe pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics deep neuromuscular blockade rocuronium course Cesarean section reversal sugammadex end procedure . Clinical hypothesis : The use deep muscle blockade Cesarean section general anesthesia , include period fetus delivery , compare standard recommend practice succinylcholine , improve surgical condition allow faster easy delivery fetus positive effect postnatal adaptation . Faster delivery reduce incision delivery interval decrease time anesthetic administration delivery . This reduce amount anesthetic cross placenta fetal circulation . Both , reduce amount anesthetic reduce incision delivery interval improve newborn adaptation Cesarean delivery . Deep neuromuscular blockade also improve surgical condition whole surgery , shallow neuromuscular blockade routinely use . We assume deep neuromuscular blockade entire surgery create well surgical condition faster easy uterus suture rest surgery thus reduce perioperative blood loss incidence surgical complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Surgical Conditions Cesarean Section Under General Anesthesia With Deep Neuromuscular Blockade Versus Succinylcholine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean delivery general anesthesia one surgical procedure , important factor safety speed surgery , newborn adaptation strongly depend time induction general anesthesia ( administration anesthetic ) pennywort ligation . The short possible interval essential amount anesthetic cross placenta fetal circulation . The requirement fast time applies suture uterus , duration suture directly affect amount blood loss . Hence create best surgical condition allow fast delivery performance whole surgery , safe fetus mother , extremely important . The question , whether recent recommendation Cesarean section general anesthesia best meet requirement . We assume create well surgical condition could positively affected time safety fetus delivery ( thus adaptation ) , also reduction perioperative blood loss incidence surgical complication ( primarily subfascial hematoma , bladder injury , dehiscence , surgical site infection ) . For high risk regurgitation aspiration rapid sequence induction general anesthesia method choice Cesarean section last forty year [ 1 ] . This mean intubation apnoeic pause perform soon possible administration anesthetic muscle relaxant . The traditional basic requirement administer muscle relaxant primarily time onset action creation good intubating condition . The depolarize agent succinylcholine ( 1 1.5 mg/kg ) still worldwide recommended muscle relaxant choice parturients undergo rapid-sequence induction general anesthesia provide adequate intubating condition within approximately 45 second intravenous administration [ 2 ] . But essential likewise , administration muscle relaxant affect creation intubate condition , effect relaxation abdominal wall muscle effect also surgical condition fetus delivery . Surprisingly , knowledge , effect study yet . From perspective , take account negative effect succinylcholine , rocuronium seem preferable alternative . Rocuronium dose 0.6 mg/kg pregnant woman induces good intubating condition similar succinylcholine [ 1 , 3 , 4 ] , still reasonable time apnoeic intubation [ 5 ] . But compare succinylcholine , allow short muscle blockade ( may thus prolong delivery complicate case consequence postnatal fetus adaptation ) , rocuronium induces deep muscle relaxation offer good surgical condition easier fast fetus delivery . As stated recent recommendation , additional neuromuscular blockade fetus delivery either necessary ( provide mother adequate depth anesthesia administration volatile agent opioid ) , small dose short-acting nondepolarizing agent ( infusion succinylcholine ) administer [ 2 ] . This mean , succinylcholine use muscle relaxant , due short action surgery perform shallow neuromuscular blockade . We assume deep neuromuscular blockade surgery offer good surgical condition suture uterus rest surgery thus reduce time surgery perioperative blood loss even incidence surgical complication . Such comparison study date . Comparison surgical condition fetus delivery influence fetus adaptation also investigate yet . Unanswered question , whether deep muscle blockade wit rocuronium , allow improved surgical condition also improve newborn adaptation compare traditional approach succinylcholine .</detailed_description>
