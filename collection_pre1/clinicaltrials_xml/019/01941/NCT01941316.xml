	<brief_title>Study Carfilzomib With Irinotecan Irinotecan-Sensitive Malignancies Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer account approximately 15 % lung cancer diagnose United States ( US ) , 60-80 % response rate platinum-based chemotherapy extensive disease . Despite sensitivity chemotherapy , small cell lung cancer characterize extensive disease dissemination presentation overall prognosis remain poor , 2-year overall survival le 5 % median survival approximately 9-11 month . Currently , FDA-approved second-line therapy oral parenteral topotecan , although irinotecan also commonly use primary relapsed disease . Novel combination therapy desperately need disease order improve survival . Proteasome inhibition affect level numerous cell cycle control proteins , apoptosis , cell adhesion , angiogenesis , chemoresistance protein . Carfilzomib proteasome inhibitor interrupt cellular pathway integral survival small cell lung cancer , namely dysregulated apoptotic pathway involve activated nuclear factor-kB ( NF-kB ) . NF-kB activates transcription anti-apoptotic proliferation gene , mediate tumor cell survival response cytotoxic stress result chemoresistance , common problem small cell lung cancer . Carfilzomib prevent proteasomal degradation IkB , inhibitor NF-kB , also modulate level anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 tumor suppressor p53 . Overexpression Bcl-2 , key mediator resistance apoptosis follow chemotherapy , important problem SCLC , vast majority SCLC case bcl-2 overexpression , low level bcl-2 b1-integrin associate improved survival SCLC . Topoisomerase-1 thought cause apoptosis via mechanisms NF-kB , add potential synergy compound . In addition , topoisomerase-1 overexpressed majority subject SCLC decrease degradation enzyme expect lead enhancement mechanism apoptosis . Irinotecan , camptothecins , inhibit topoisomerase I . As class , camptothecins show efficacy small cell lung cancer variety setting . The pivotal phase III study lead FDA approval topotecan relapse small cell lung cancer Von Pawel et al , include 211 subject sensitive ( &gt; 60 day since prior therapy ) relapse randomize either topotecan ( 107 subject ) daily 5 day cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine ( CAV ) , give every 21 day . Topotecan show significant improvement median time progression ( 13.3 week vs.12.3 week , p=0.552 ) median survival ( 25 week vs. 24.7 week , p=0.795 ) , however , subject treat topotecan improvement cancer-related symptom ( dyspnea , hoarseness , anorexia , fatigue ) well hematologic toxicity . Irinotecan , establish activity small cell lung cancer , well non-small cell lung cancer , colorectal cancer ovarian cancer . Le Chevalier colleague use every 3-week schedule irinotecan , 350 mg/m2 , give 32 chemotherapy-naive SCLC subject show objective response rate 16 % median survival 4.5 month . Thus , median survival camptothecins second -line set SCLC range 24 35 week , subject sensitive relapse median survival 4 8 week longer refractory relapse . The use Carfilzomib combination Irinotecan , topoisomerase inhibitor , expect differ previous effort proteasome inhibitor sustain proteasome inhibition potential synergy class drug . For Phase 1b patient enter onto dose cohort 3 patient . At least three patient dose level must complete cycle one study leadership ( principal investigator Study statistician ) allow patient enrol onto successive dose level . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) define accord National Cancer Institute 's CTCAE v.4.0 toxicity scale . For Phase 2 patient treated Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Carfilzomib determine Phase 1b 125mg/m2 Irinotecan .</detailed_description>
