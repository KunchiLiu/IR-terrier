	<brief_summary>Carnitine essential transport fatty acid mitochondria energy production different muscle , include myocardium . It also need protect myocyte cell membrane oxidative damage remove excess acyl carnitine group . Patients receive chronic intermittent hemodialysis ( HD ) know increase risk carnitine deficiency result removal dialysis procedure , lack endogenous synthesis kidney , inadequate dietary intake . The carnitine status child undergo continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) study . Children undergo CRRT intensive care unit ( ICU ) setting may increase risk carnitine deficiency due continuous removal , lack carnitine production kidney , absence carnitine intake ( majority child eat carnitine add total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) . Carnitine deficiency may increase risk cardiac dysfunction critically ill child . This first study examine carnitine status child undergo CRRT . Standard echo well sensitive speckle track echo use evaluate effect carnitine deficiency myocardial function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : The research design consist prospective study group would compare two control group ( prospective control group retrospective control group ) . The study group consist critically ill child receive CRRT IV carnitine supplementation ( added TPN ) . The prospective control group consist critically ill child receive CRRT carnitine Retrospective control group consist critically ill child receive CRRT receive carnitine supplementation . . Subjects prospective study control group recruit pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) cardiac intensive care unit ( CICU ) Children 's National . Informed consent obtain participant enrol prospective study control group . Data retrospective control group obtain medical record .</detailed_description>
