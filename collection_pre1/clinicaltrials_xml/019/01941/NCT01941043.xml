	<brief_summary>The current study evaluate antidepressant effect CERC-301 28 day treatment subject MDD currently experience severe depressive episode despite stable ongoing treatment selective serotonin- serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI SNRI ) . The study population enrich subject would benefit rapid onset , recent active suicidal ideation , risk others deem appropriate out-patient study careful safety surveillance . This allow study focus antidepressant effect CERC-301 also explore effect suicidal ideation . To explore rapid onset , primary endpoint 7 day , effect 28 day treatment examine secondary endpoint .</brief_summary>
