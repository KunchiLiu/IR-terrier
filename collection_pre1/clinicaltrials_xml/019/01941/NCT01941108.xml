	<detailed_description>Research Question Can real-time collection patient-level data use smartphones feasibly effectively utilized peer navigator deliver timely individualized support intervention outside clinical setting , thereby facilitate improve engagement HIV care medication adherence HIV-infected drug user ? Aims Optimal benefit antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) contingent upon consistent engagement HIV care reliable medication adherence . HIV-infected intravenous drug user ( IDUs ) delay entrance under-utilize medical care . Those access HIV care frequently lose follow intermittent user . Out-of-care IDUs likely develop AIDS , reduce survival , engage risky behavior place others risk HIV transmission ; therefore , evidence-based tool promote engagement IDUs care urgently need . Clinic-based , individualized support deliver case manager patient navigator improve engagement HIV care many patient , setting sufficient resource offer adaptive , individualized , long-term support need . Mobile health ( mHealth ) technology able collect patient-level data real time facilitate responsive communication hold promise effective strategy optimize HIV care medication adherence IDUs . The objective pilot feasibility trial planning grant obtain feasibility , acceptability trial optimization data inform design implementation randomize trial fully evaluate hypothesis . To accomplish objective , specific aim include : Specific Aim 1 . To evaluate feasibility participant acceptability mHealth-enhanced peer navigation improve retention care out-of-care , ART-eligible IDUs . In mobile phone-based intervention , participant utilize smartphone interface report perceive barrier access care adhere prescribed therapy . Through repeat quantitative qualitative evaluation , investigator assess feasibility , participant acceptability logistical challenge ( e.g. , retention , participant burden , device loss , data quality , response fatigue , perceive support ) intervention sustain one year follow-up . Specific Aim 2 . To define trial element require optimization future randomize clinical trial mHealth-enhanced peer navigation . The long-term effectiveness mHealth intervention ( i.e. , maintenance sustain HIV RNA suppression year ) , require large expensive clinical trial . In prudent preparation future trial , investigator collect preliminary efficacy data compare peer-navigation/smartphone intervention usual care several alternative endpoint , include time ART initiation , miss visit frequency , rate virologic suppression . Investigators also define optimal patient load scope work peer navigator intensity frequency electronic communication facilitate meaningful peer support . Background Patient navigator successfully employ assist person utilize complex medical service . In contrast medical case management paradigm , tend involve delivery specific , predefined service , patient navigation feature responsive , flexible problem-solving overcome perceive barrier care . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend psychosocial support HIV-infected person promote use peer address care retention need . In resource-constrained setting , peer train specific health-related task represent potentially cost-efficient sustainable workforce . Besides addiction mental health co-morbidity , HIV-infected IDUs often limit income , education , insurance , social support , unstable housing food insecurity . Poor health literacy , negative experience medical institution negative health-related belief may pose additional barrier care . The role peer navigator HIV care influence area impact engagement care , namely : 1 ) Educate counsel regard acceptance HIV diagnosis understand HIV prevention treatment , 2 ) Assist overcome practical barrier care ( e.g. , access social service like drug treatment , housing transportation assistance , 3 ) Identify reduce source instability , 4 ) Facilitate patient cop life skill training , 5 ) Improve patient-provider communication . Data suggest peer-led intervention personalize practical , address individual concern barrier rather group-level support.8 The frequency intensity patient-peer interaction need individualization extent mobile technology improve communication toward end need clarification . mHealth approach optimize HIV care Use mobile cellular device grow rapidly worldwide , increase 2 billion subscription 2005 estimate 5.3 billion end 2010.9 The promise mobile health ( mHealth ) technology strengthen health care delivery resource-limited setting acknowledge United Nations Joint Programme HIV/AIDS ( UNAIDS ) development strategic plan . Short Message Service ( SMS ) text message recently show large randomize trial effective intervention smoke cessation . Text message also effectively utilized improve attendance clinic appointment , although data available HIV clinic . ART dose reminder message send pager mobile phone use several setting improve adherence . Two recent randomize mHealth study sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate benefit weekly text message improve adherence rate viral suppression . Additional randomize trial SMS adherence reminder development India Cameroon . Rationale The rationale Peer Navigators ( PNs ) work HIV-infected IDUs similar background share experience strengthen relationship provide PNs access credibility easily achieve medical professional . HIV infection among IDUs transmit drug-using network . However , peer network also serve vehicle several peer-driven intervention demonstrate efficacy reduce HIV risk behavior , often outperform traditional approach . With lower-income , poorly educate , predominantly minority HIV-infected IDUs , investigator propose knowledgeable 'peer ' provide counsel support entrance care ART initiation , remain stable presence maintenance phase could directly address many barrier encounter community . Population Description Study participant primarily recruit exist ALIVE cohort . Additional participant recruit among patient receive HIV care past Johns Hopkins Moore Clinic . Sample Size The total sample size study 60 , 30 participant study arm . Because main objective study demonstrate feasibility acceptance mHealth intervention , analysis data generate largely exploratory descriptive , rather driven priori hypothesis . In November 2012 , ALIVE Study identify 54 participant meet criterion HIV care recent drug use . The Moore Clinic clinical staff estimate around 180 patient could meet criterion , provide combine pool roughly 230 individual study begin recruitment . Recruitment Potential participant approach regular visit interviewer Research Coordinator participate new study . Invitation determine clinic interviewer staff , notify Research Coordinator participant eligible . Potential participant contact ALIVE Study Moore Clinic , base recent data record . If ALIVE participant self-reports study interviewer never care care year , refer study coordinator information screening . Eligible individual confirm receive HIV care past year assist scheduling appointment primary care provider Moore Clinic . Only participant attend first HIV care visit ( confirm electronic medical record ) undergo enrollment randomization . As part Moore clinic effort identify out-of-care person , periodically review record contact individual directly clarify patient see another provider support re-engage care Moore clinic . The clinic ( namely Jeanne Keruly staff ) share information out-of-care Moore clinic patient mP2P study assist u identify out-of-care person schedule appointment . At subsequent visit , Moore Clinic patient meet coordinator ( preferably day ) information screening . The study use recruitment script screen tool . Potential participant may also refer study coordinator eligibility screen Moore Clinic provider encounter patient lose follow-up ( i.e . see primary HIV provider one year ) , present clinic new visit , administrative issue urgent care appointment . With provider assent , recruiter approach patient , explain study interested , schedule attend enrollment visit consent obtain . Informed Consent Process The Research Coordinator read consent form aloud enrol participant provide train instruction use device . The study participant sign name date form , Coordinator . A copy consent form provide client . Individuals cognitively impair extent either give informed consent give self-report exclude . Self-report central outcome measure ; include participant would invalidate study . Part evaluation intervention include elicitation feedback peer navigator staff regard impression effectiveness intervention , unforeseen challenge best practice . As part monthly staff meeting study coordinator PN clinical supervisor , 30-60 minute focus group conduct peer navigator . Because conversation audio record analyze , participation focus group constitute research . Written inform consent obtain PNs study coordinator session . Peer Health Navigation After first HIV care visit , participant return Wood Clinic baseline interview randomization one two study arm ( PN treatment usual ) . Investigators model peer navigation intervention several HIV prevention trial aim assist high-risk individual overcome logistical barrier receive social service medical care . Peer Navigators part-time employee study , hire Johns Hopkins School Public Health ( JHSPH ) Human Resources procedure , work approximately 10-15 hour per week , meeting study participant person phone discus strategy remain engaged care overcome logistical challenge encounter health care system . Persons live HIV successfully navigate health care system receive ongoing HIV care encourage apply , HIV-positive status requirement position . The PN log PN-participant contact daily use eMOCHA system . This allow assessment level intensity PN-participant contact may associate clinical benefit , well inform appropriate caseload PNs . The frequency , duration , nature PN/patient interaction well assessment action plan goal identify barrier compare outcome study aim , include time ART initiation , miss visit frequency , rate virologic suppression . The study coordinator serve operational supervisor peer navigator , responsible facilitating communication among PNs research staff . The study coordinator provide technical assistance web-based patient track software assist review participant-specific data . The coordinator responsible match PNs eligible participant , ensure data collect accord schedule specification research protocol , organize train hire PNs , set regular operational supervision meeting . A co-investigator ( Dr. Hutton ) train clinical psychology extensive experience HIV-infected person substance abuse serve clinical supervisor peer navigator . She responsible organize regular clinical supervision session review case study , address issue PN/counseling overlap discus issue arise execution work . These session mix group individual level supervision . The clinical supervisor help PNs deal issue set boundary participant develop method deal urgent issue . Clinical supervisor ensure clinical assistance available PNs situation arise license mental health worker 's assistance need . Additional support provide clinician HIV care provider train address specific medical need IDUs . Feedback perceive logistical challenge relate PN/participant interaction overall conduct study collect monthly meeting operational supervisor . The entire team investigator compile review comment quarterly meeting throughout study . At 3 month 9 month start study , monthly PN meeting consist formal focus group , lead co-investigator qualitative research method expertise . Ecologic Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) EMA refers use electronic handheld data collection device collect real-time information stress , drug craving drug use participant context daily routine , rather research study . In study , participant give smartphone carry one year . The current phone model use Motorola Droid X2 , run application develop use software platform create Center Clinical Global Health Education ( CCGHE ) Johns Hopkins School Medicine . The application , name electronic Mobile Open-source Comprehensive Health Application ( eMOCHA ) , use support community health worker resource poor area heavily impact HIV . It modify CCGHE program team specifically study . A staff member train participant use eMOCHA interface relevant feature smartphone . Participants require show run `` demo '' questionnaire commence use field . Smartphone-based data collection participant intervention arm commence two business day follow randomization , allow troubleshoot device problem participant ' increase familiarity eMOCHA interface . At scheduled data-collection time , participant 's phone generate audible alert eMOCHA application automatically launch . To protect confidentiality , every eMOCHA session begin password-entry screen contain information . Frequency length EMA session dynamic course study order individualize intervention collect process data relate Aim 2 . By default , participant receive two prompt daily first three month study . Based participant feedback , rate EMA response level engagement HIV care , protocol may convert `` maintenance phase '' le frequent prompt initial three-month in-person study visit . Each eMOCHA session feature multiple-choice free-text question item relate three domain : engagement HIV care ( retention adherence ) , drug/alcohol use , mood . The drug use item query participant regard intensity drug craving occurrence drug use . The brief version Profile Mood States ( POMS ) use assess mood anger , depression anxiety . Within domain , eMOCHA application guide participant three step ( 1 ) ass participant 's current experience symptom , ( 2 ) ass barrier engagement care , ( 3 ) provide support message information . Peer navigator monitor response participant time , contact participant report specific problem , appear increase level self-reported negative mood state , drug use , poor medication adherence . Twice day , smartphone signal participant answer questionnaire . Participants 15 minute respond notification . The alarm occur 9:00 9:00 pm . One alarm go random time every day alarm always go 9:00 pm recap happen day . The question take five minute every day . Also , participant use drug crave use drug , report event use questionnaire similar random questionnaire , tailor contain drug-specific content . Global Positioning System ( GPS ) Data As continuation previous effort EXACT Study , investigator compare global positioning system ( GPS ) data neighborhood-level psychosocial stress indicator drug-related EMA behavioral data . Participants ' location record every five minute use smartphone 's internal GPS . GPS data encrypt transfer wirelessly secure server daily . The GPS data phone delete transfer . Participants ' daily EMA data compare weekly ACASI data tag GPS data construct temporal spatial profile drug use psychosocial stress . Biological Samples Every three month , trained phlebotomist draw 10mL whole blood place repository , use approve biosafety procedure . Current research actively investigate several promising biological marker stress . If , anticipate , valid reliable biomarker longer-term stress ( order week month ) identify , blood sample repository test appropriate laboratory . Genetic study may include host viral genetics . Follow-up assessment HIV care utilization Participants study arm return Wood clinic every three month collect reimbursement participation complete follow-up questionnaire assessing domain evaluate baseline questionnaire . The study also collect 10mL ( 2 teaspoon ) blood serum storage future test . This study visit take 30 minute . This study uniquely benefit exist data share agreement Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort ( JHHCC ) study , allow highly accurate timely ascertainment care utilization endpoint ART prescription pharmacy fill date collect database verify participant-reported date ART initiation . Appointment data electronically manage Moore Clinic Registration System ( Epic Enterprise Scheduling Software , Madison , WI ) . All ambulatory visit schedule input system point service incoming calls staff train use database . When patient register day appointment , visit key complete visit . JHHCC data available download within approximately two week enter system . Importantly , assess clinic attendance prescription ART use external database allow assessment main endpoint randomize participant even retain study . Study staff conduct in-depth , qualitative interview among 30 participant intervention arm . Ten randomly select complete interview 3-6 month intervention , order provide feedback may use refine intervention subsequent trial period ; remain 20 interviewed end follow-up collect data overall experience intervention . In order start processing data , memo develop interviewer data collect . Interviews semi-structured ; interview guide predefined main theme , guide mean dynamic allow new topic emerge course interview . Important topic include : ( 1 ) satisfaction challenge eMOCHA interface , ( 2 ) satisfaction relationship peer navigator ( 3 ) , perceive intrusiveness intervention , ( 4 ) ongoing challenge engagement HIV care , ( 5 ) way smartphone may facilitate get HIV care information/help ( e.g . informal support network , internet ) . Focus group conduct peer navigator staff allow investigator team get good understand effectiveness intervention , unforeseen challenge best practice . These occur part monthly staff meeting study coordinator PN clinical supervisor , last 30-60 minute , audio-recorded later thematic analysis . Blinding Neither investigator participant blind study arm individual randomize . Rationale use non-treatment group In order justify spending resource new , technology-based intervention , essential demonstrate add value compare currently available care . The Johns Hopkins Moore Clinic employ limited number full-time social worker , nurse , peer advocate share responsibility coordinate outpatient HIV care facilitate referral ancillary service . While level staff inadequate provide comprehensive , individualized case management every patient , patient desire assistance aspect care same-day access support , represent currently available standard care . Nearly new patient see Moore Clinic meet social worker complete initial intake visit medical provider , may schedule follow-up meeting need see walk-in basis . Control-group participant work clinic-based support staff coordination care , mean peer navigator actively facilitate interaction control group participant clinic provider initial HIV care visit . Participant removal criterion Study participant may terminate participation study time . If smartphone lose , steal damage use , study assign new one charge . Participants never pay replace device . However , second smartphone lose , steal damage , ask leave mP2P Study . This affect participation ALIVE Study clinical care Moore clinic . Certificate Confidentiality The mP2P study collect data population person formerly currently engage illegal reportable activity , namely drug use . As mP2P study design sub-study ALIVE cohort , modification make exist Certificate Confidentiality issue National Institute Drug Abuse ( DA-87-042 ) protect sensitive information report participant . Consent Process Documentation Informed consent take place Johns Hopkins University , carry Project Coordinator . Additional study staff may train consent procedure , provide backup study . The Coordinator read consent form aloud potential participant read along . The participant able ask question consent process sign form . Risks Benefits Minimal risk : The probability magnitude harm discomfort anticipate research great ordinarily encounter daily life routine physical psychological examination test . Smartphone ( EMA ) : Participants may feel hassle annoyed EMA prompt . Also , question personal might feel comfortable answer question . Participants unfamiliar smartphones electronic device could feel discomfort frustration deal technology . Smartphone ( GPS ) : The main risk carry GPS unit loss privacy . Using GPS device significantly increase participant ' risk burden currently experience . Many participant already use mobile phone daily , contain system user 's location track . Encrypted data wirelessly uploaded secure server erase device daily . The risk procedure regard smartphone explain screening consent . Phlebotomy : Phlebotomy perform draw blood vein forearm antecubital fossa . This may cause pain insertion needle slight bruise afterward . ACASI : Some question ACASI questionnaire personal participant might feel uncomfortable upset answering . Participants may refuse answer question . Confidentiality : Although precaution take protect privacy , chance confidentiality break . All data collect outside study clinic protect Certificates Confidentiality ALIVE I ALIVE II study . Participants remind legal requirement confidentiality within ALIVE Study . Confidentiality risk minimize use study material without personal identifier , use unique study number , follow strict procedure data collection , data entry , data analysis . Peer Navigators know participant name may contact information participant store mobile phone , carry information link participant ' identity study-related information outside lock office Wood Clinic . Description Level Research Burden Volunteers project normal daily activity interrupt twice per day . However , interruption EMA response take 3-5 minute . One purpose study find high burden population . The maximum total daily time devote study 15 20 minute , even event-generated response . Each weekly visit take 30 minute , include time spent wait room . Description Potential Benefits Participants may benefit directly study . Benefits society include help u understand research technique promote engagement HIV care well improve data collection . The research may help society understand environment people use drug specific challenge IDUs may encounter access HIV care . Reporting Unanticipated Problems/Adverse Events No adverse event anticipate part study . However , participant instruct contact Principal Investigator , Dr. Kirk , Research Coordinator , Mr. Genz , Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) feel harm course study procedure . Safety monitor Participants 24-hour access on-call provider Moore Clinic . If need , communication facilitate study smartphone , important clinic study-related number pre-programmed .
