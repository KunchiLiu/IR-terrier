It remain determined extent child weight status relative reinforce value food may interact obesogenic food environment affect energy intake . The primary aim study compare energy intake meal normal-weight obese child portion size palatable , energy-dense food sugar-sweetened beverage systematically increase . We hypothesize increase portion size food beverage meal lead significant increase energy intake normal-weight obese child . Obese child , however , show significantly great increase energy intake normal-weight child . A second aim study test child 's response increase portion size affect reinforce find food .

	<detailed_description>The prevalence childhood adolescent obesity reach all-time high . There press need well understand behavioral mechanism control appetite eat child identify child susceptible overeat current obesogenic food environment . Obesogenic environment offer convenient access large portion palatable , energy-dense food . The portion size food identify important determinant energy intake adult child . While portion size effect find heterogenous group healthy individual , evidence point possible individual difference magnitude child 's responsiveness large food portion . For example , data previous laboratory study suggest overweight obese child may particularly vulnerable overeat present large food portion . Further , magnitude portion size effect intake may also depend reinforce ( reward ) child find food . It possible relative reinforce value food may interact environmental cue , portion size food , affect child 's energy intake large portion palatable , energy-dense food available . The primary aim study compare effect increase portion size food beverage serve meal energy intake normal-weight obese child . A second aim test child find food reinforce relative appeal nonfood alternative show significantly great increase energy intake response increase portion size child find food less reinforcing . The finding study expect extend previous finding test environmental factor , food portion size , may interact individual difference weight status food reinforcement affect energy intake child .</detailed_description>
