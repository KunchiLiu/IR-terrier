	<brief_summary>VVZ-149 novel analgesic drug candidate show potential analgesic activity inhibit GlyT2 5HT2A simultaneously . There many effort develop single-target selective drug treat pain , usually unsuccessful due lack efficacy limitation single-target approach new drug discovery . VVZ-149 expect dual-target activity , demonstrate synergism GlyT2 5HT2A antagonistic activity maximize antinociceptive effect vivo animal model . Now investigators develop VVZ-149 IV injection treat post-operative pain . The primary objective study evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic property VVZ-149 injection placebo healthy male volunteer . This Phase 1 study consist randomize , double-blind , placebo control , single multiple ascend dose ( SAD &amp; MAD ) escalation clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics VVZ-149 Injection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In clinical study , investigational drug product offer injectable form transparent glass vial contain VVZ-149 dissolved water injection . When administer , drug dilute normal saline give intravenous infusion 4 hour . SAD study plan maximal 7 cohort healthy male subject administrate single dose VVZ-149 injection placebo . The planned group dose escalation 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 mg/kg group . As pilot study safety first-in-human study , 3 subject receive active drug allocate first two group , without subject placebo . For follow group , 6 subject active drug 2 placebo allocate randomize . MAD study plan 2 cohort 10 healthy male subject administer multiple dos VVZ-149 injection placebo . The final dos VVZ-149 injection determine later base result SAD study . In group , 7 subject active drug 3 placebo allocate randomized</detailed_description>
