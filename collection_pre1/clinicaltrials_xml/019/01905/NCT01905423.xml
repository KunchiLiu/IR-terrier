	<brief_summary>Approximately 3,500 people participate per year . The study population include female male 5 year age live filariasis endemic area . The study perform Indonesia B. timori W. bancrofti endemic area period 4 year . Participants study cross-sectional survey . Some subject may include one annual population survey , longitudinal study . Purpose study evaluate different mass drug administration ( MDA ) regimens lymphatic filariasis also study impact MDA soil transmit helminth infection ( STH ) . MDA administer others ( e.g. , Ministry Health ) . Results study may enhance effort control eliminate important neglect tropical disease . The investigator test hypothesis accelerate mass drug administration superior annual MDA elimination lymphatic filariasis control soil transmit helminth infection ( STH ) : 1 . Compare relative impact cost effectiveness annual vs. twice yearly mass drug administration ( MDA ) elimination lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) . 2 . Study impact annual vs. semiannual MDA soil transmit helminth ( STH ) infection population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization Mass Drug Administration With Existing Drug Regimens Lymphatic Filariasis Onchocerciasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) deform disable infectious disease cause elephantiasis genital deformity ( especially hydroceles ) . The infection affect 120 million people 81 country tropical subtropical region well 1 billion people risk acquire disease . LF cause Wuchereria bancrofti Brugia spp . ( B. malayi B.timori ) , nematode parasite transmit mosquito . This study base assumption currently use mass drug administration ( MDA ) regimens schedule optimal achieve elimination LF . These regimen ( either annual Albendazole ( Alb ) 400 mg plus diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) 6 mg/kg Alb 400 mg plus ivermectin ( Iver ) 200 Âµg/kg LF ) develop 10 year ago . Drugs use LF MDA also active soil transmit helminth infection ( STH , e.g. , Ascaris , Hookworm , Trichuris ) . De-worming campaign use anthelminthic usually target special group population , schoolchildren , limited impact transmission . Treatment total population semiannual treatment may reduce re-infection considerably likely lead reduce infection density infection prevalence . Suppression STH important ancillary benefit MDA program filarial infection . Purpose : The study aim compare effectiveness yearly ( 1X ) versus twice yearly ( 2X ) mass drug administration ( MDA ) elimination lymphatic filariasis control soil-transmitted helminth ( intestinal parasite ) large population . Mass drug administration provide Indonesia Ministry Health . This project assess impact public health program . Procedures : Study procedure include collection finger prick blood test microfilaremia serology test ( antigenemia antibody test ) . Stool sample collect detect STH infection . All assay perform Indonesia ( filarial serology test , blood smear detection microfilariae ( MF ) , stool examination detection worm egg ) . Washington University researcher develop protocol , provide train guidance Indonesian researcher , work analyze data . Indonesian researcher consent participant , obtain stool blood specimen , perform laboratory test specimen , enter data participant lab result .</detailed_description>
