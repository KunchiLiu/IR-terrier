	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer , especially advanced metastatic stage , devastate disease . It fourth lead cause cancer death . Its prognosis grim - 5-year survival rate 6 % . The current therapy advance metastatic pancreatic cancer toxic limit efficacy . A safer effective therapy devastate disease greatly need . G-FLIP regimen combination low dos ( dos low approve FDA use clinic ) several anti-cancer drug , Gemcitabine , Fluorouracil , Leucovorin , Irinotecan Oxaliplatin . The efficacy G-FLIP cancer ( especially pancreatic cancer ) base laboratory clinical result , indicate synergistic efficacy anti-cancer drug cancer cell overcome tumor drug resistance cancer cell frequently develop . Also , low dos , regimen less toxic drug use alone . Meanwhile , intravenous infusion high dos ( dos significantly high daily nutritional requirement ) Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) observe anti-cancer activity . This especially true Vitamin C use combination anti-cancer drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ph 2 Trial Vitamin C &amp; G-FLIP ( Low Doses Gemcitabine , 5FU , Leucovorin , Irinotecan , Oxaliplatin ) Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVE The objective study evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy G-FLIP ( Low Doses Gemcitabine , Fluorouracil [ 5FU ] , Leucovorin , Irinotecan , Oxaliplatin ) , use combination ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) , first-line therapy patient advance pancreatic cancer . The objective study also evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy G-FLIP-DM ( G-FLIP + Low Doses Docetaxel Mitomycin C ) , use combination ascorbic acid , patient advance pancreatic cancer develop Disease Progression ( DP ) G-FLIP treatment . The primary endpoint 12-month survival rate . The secondary endpoint include Overall Survival ( OS ) , Quality Life ( QOL ) , Response Rate ( RR ) , Progression-Free-Survival ( PFS ) , safety . STUDY DRUGS Study drug include G-FLIP , G-FLIP-DM , Vitamin C ( Ascorbic Acid ) STUDY DESIGN Sample Size : There 30 `` evaluable '' study subject study . Treatments : G-FLIP : All study subject treat G-FLIP . Each treatment cycle G-FLIP 2 week , G-FLIP give Days 1 2 cycle . If study subject exhibit Disease Progression ( DP ) , treatment G-FLIP stop , treat G-FLIP-DM . G-FLIP-DM : Study subject exhibit DP G-FLIP treatment treat G-FLIP-DM . Each G-FLIP-DM treatment cycle 2 week , G-FLIP-DM give Days 1 2 cycle . Ascorbic Acid : Ascorbic acid administer twice weekly throughout study , give 2 separate day week . Ascorbic acid administer throughout study include follow-up period , even treatment G-FLIP G-FLIP-DM terminate due DP . Additionally , 50 % study subject ( i.e. , 15 evaluable study subject ) , treatment ascorbic acid begin week G-FLIP begin . In 50 % study subject ( i.e. , 15 evaluable study subject ) , treatment ascorbic acid delay 2 cycle . Results 2 group study subject would allow comparison potential acute safety ascorbic acid , use combination G-FLIP . Open-Label : This open-label study , investigator study subject blind treatment . Randomization : The assignment study subject randomize , long meet eligibility criterion study . DOSE DELAY AND DOSE MODIFICATION In event adverse drug reaction , dose delay dose modification dependent type toxicity . The detailed dose modification scheme G-FLIP , G-FLIP-DM Ascorbic Acid outline protocol . CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT Other G-FLIP , G-FLIP-DM ascorbic acid , patient receive standard investigational treatment cancer , study drug non-cancer indication , study . All concomitant medication ( include name , dosage schedule ) must record . Prophylactic treatment drug-related symptom give accord Package Inserts study drug clinical practice . Supportive treatment may include anti-emetic , anti-diarrhea , anti-pyretic , anti-allergic , anti-hypertensive , analgesic , antibiotic , allopurinol , others blood product bone marrow growth factor . Patients may use erythropoietin anemia . The investigator may utilize erythropoietic factor , blood platelet transfusion discretion . DURATION OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP At least six month treatment recommend study subject response G-FLIP G-FLIP-DM , unless : - Patients exhibit disease progression opinion principal investigator - Unacceptable toxicity treatment - Patient withdrawal consent ( Note : The investigator make every effort contact subject perform final evaluation determine reason ( ) withdrawal study . ) - Investigator 's discretion withdraw patient study continued participation study patient 's best interest . - Underlying illness : condition , injury , disease unrelated intend disease study investigating , render continue treatment unsafe regular follow-up impossible - General specific change patient 's condition render patient ineligible investigational treatment - Non-compliance investigational treatment , protocol-required evaluation follow-up visit After treatment , study subject follow information survival post study treatment available least 1 year study subject participate trial . EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS The efficacy study drug assess accord follow parameter : Response Criteria Complete Response ( CR ) , Partial Response ( PR ) , Stable Disease ( SD ) , Progressive Disease ( Disease Progression DP ) derive CT MRI accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) ( Eisenhauer et al . 2009 ) . Response Rate ( RR ) number study subject , express percentage total number study subject participate trial , exhibit PR CR confirm 2 consecutive scan ( CT MRI ) . Progression-Free-Survival ( PFS ) length time SD ( well ) study subject first documented time DP , death cause , occur . Overall Survival ( OStreatment ) time study subject first treat G-FLIP time death cause occur . OS , time study subject first diagnose advanced pancreatic cancer time death cause occur , also record . 12-Month Survival Rate number study subject , express percentage total number study subject trial , survive 12 month start time study subject accrue trial . The 12-Month Survival Rate study subject survive 12 month start time study subject first diagnose advanced pancreatic cancer also record . Safety Assessments The efficacy study drug assess first dose 1 month last dose study drug . The assessment base follow parameter , perform baseline various time study : - physical exam - evaluation symptom - vital sign - ECOG performance status survival - clinical pathology ( clinical chemistry , renal function [ assess utilizing Cockcroft-Gault formula ] , hematology , coagulation ) - urinalysis - QOL , assess describe Aaronson NK , et al . 1993 .</detailed_description>
