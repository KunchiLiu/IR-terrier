	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The main objective project compare efficacy single-hormone closed-loop strategy , dual-hormone closed-loop strategy pump therapy regulate overnight glucose level out-patient study adult adolescent type 1 diabetes . The investigator hypothesize dual-hormone closed-loop strategy effective regulating overnight glucose level adult adolescent type 1 diabetes compare single-hormone closed-loop strategy , turn effective conventional pump therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . We aim conduct multicenter study compare efficacy conventional pump therapy , single-hormone closed-loop strategy dual-hormone closed-loop strategy regulate overnight glucose level , home , adolescent adults type 1 diabetes . Each intervention test two night : 1 ) After carbohydrate-rich dinner meal ( exaggerate hyperglycemic risk ; 2 ) After even exercise ( exaggerate hypoglycemic risk ) .</detailed_description>
