	<brief_title>Complementary Alternative Medicine Sauna Detoxification Study : Phase I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , 2-Arm randomized trial . All study participant actively undergo sauna intervention session observation session . The time Phone Screen End Study Visit vary individual schedule . For purpose study , participant consider 'actively enrol ' s/he sign Full Study Consent Form first sauna observation visit ( SV1 OV1 ) . Each participant actively enrol least 7 week , 22 week . All participant undergo Phone Screen eligibility prior participate study-related visit . Candidates first ask oral consent screen , grant , question continue . If participant meet pre-screening criterion assess phone , ask schedule In-Person Screening Visit . Prior randomization , participant participate In-Person Screening Visit Bastyr University ( BU ) Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) : inform consent , blood draw screen lab analysis , anthropomorphic measurement , 12-lead ECG assessment , provide demographic data , medical history assessment . If participant remain interested eligible , randomize either Sauna-First Arm Observation-First Arm within 2 week eligibility ascertainment use block randomization scheme . Participants know intervention , know PCB level , result questionnaire assessment approximately three month end study . The PI review monitoring AE data , blind PCB data analysis . After screen , randomization , informed consent , study participant either Arm either complete 3-week observation period follow 3-week medically monitor sauna-based detoxification intervention ; first complete 3-week medically monitor sauna-based detoxification intervention , follow 3-week observation period . Each participant also End Study Visit least 7 day last study visit ( Sauna Observation Visit -depending Arm ) . The sauna pre-warmed 160 degree Fahrenheit humidity set 25 % +/- 5 % . Participants schedule 10-min break every 30 minute sauna , time vital sign , symptom , fluid intake assess record . During Sauna Visits weekly lab assessment perform compare participant ' baseline lab value sauna intervention , monitor safety . In addition , weekly serum sample take PCB assessment . During Observation Visit blood draw Complete Blood Count Differential ( CBC/D ) , Comprehensive Metabolic Panel ( CMP ) , PCBs analysis perform , well query symptoms MOSES questionnaire assess .</detailed_description>
