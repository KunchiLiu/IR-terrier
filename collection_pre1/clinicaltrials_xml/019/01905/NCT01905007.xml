	<brief_title>Study Defibrillation Testing In Patients Undergoing Initial ICD Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) effective treatment primary secondary prevention sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) . At time ICD implantation , ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) typically induced demonstrate effective arrhythmia termination implant device . Although defibrillation threshold ( DFT ) test induction VF time ICD insertion currently consider `` standard care , '' instruction usage device approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) include label DFT test , value defibrillation test modern-day device question . Defibrillation test associate serious complication may add cost procedure . It hypothesize patient undergo defibrillation test outcome similar undergo defibrillation test time initial implantation . This pilot study perform determine feasibility perform large , multi-center clinical trial longer follow-up investigate whether defibrillation test impact overall mortality , implant complication , long-term first shock efficacy clinical follow-up .</detailed_description>
