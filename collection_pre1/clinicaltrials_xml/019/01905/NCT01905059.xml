	<brief_title>Evaluation Maintenance Strategy With Protease Inhibitors With Without Lamivudine Virologically Suppressed HIV Patients Second Line Antiretroviral Treatment Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification : The interest treat HIV infection single molecule clear long time . Many clinical trial test efficacy strategy , mainly use boost protease inhibitor ( PI ) . Despite remain doubt low level viremia , viral control reservoir , durability effect , trial show attractive result absolute increase risk virological failure 2 % 13 % compare standard care possible decrease cost toxicity . In resource-limited country interest treatment simplification even important : decrease cost , toxicity ( often poorly monitor ) , number pill take per day , etc . In addition , patient second line kind resistance NRTI highly probable , interruption second line NRTI could help avoid accumulation mutation RT presence residual low level replication , spar future treatment option . The 184 mutation retro-transcriptase cause resistance lamivudine/emtricitabine seem hind viral replication . The persistence mutation could eventually facilitate action PI monotherapy protect patient mutation . The choice viral load ( VL ) threshold diagnosis failure resource-limited country easy , 2LADY trial use clinical practice , threshold 1000 copies/ml allow genotyping evidence mutation . This value probably select reference value WHO next recommendation . To minimize risk viral escape development resistance MOBIDIP study threshold 200 copies/ml choose switch monotherapy 500 copies/ml definition failure . Principal objective : To evaluate failure rate 96 week PI monotherapy without lamivudine , HIV positive patient second line treatment ( ART ) least 48 week , VL le 200 copies/ml Africa ( Yaoundé , Bobo Dioulasso , Dakar ) . Specific objective : To evaluate : - viral efficacy threshold 50 copies/ml 48 96 week , - failure rate 500 copies/ml 24 week reintroduction NRTI backbone case monotherapy failure , - clinical immunological outcome , - development mutation , - tolerance impact metabolic profile - neuro-cognitive disorder , - adherence Methods : multicenter , randomize , superiority trial evaluate efficacy mono bi-therapy protease inhibitor without lamivudine period 96 week . The primary outcome failure rate 96 week . Failure define : 1 ) viral load ≥500 copies/ml , 2 ) reintroduction NRTI backbone , 3 ) interruption PI . A sample 260 participant plan . Schedule : After approval national Ethical committee national authority , patient follow 2LADY trial least 48 week , present eligibility criterion , stop NRTI backbone randomize ( 6 month ) add lamivudine PI monotherapy . All patient follow 96 week . In case viral load 500 copies/ml study , original NRTI backbone re-introduced patient follow extra 24 week verify viral response . The complete trial due last 3 year . Expected result : This study allow validation maintenance strategy patient second line ART less expensive toxic . In addition result could use guide clinical practice physician resource poor country In march 2016 interim analysis ask DSMB show increase risk failure monotherpay arm arm stop . Participant switch standard second line triple therapy follow Week 96 . Participant dual therapy continue follow . Comparative analysis plan data week 60 visit ( last visit participant randomize treatment ) .</detailed_description>
