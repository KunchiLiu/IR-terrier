	<detailed_description>Squamous cell carcinoma culmination multistep carcinogenesis process precede early stage refer squamous dysplasia actinic keratosis . Squamous dysplasia ( SD ) also know `` field effect '' clinically characterize xerosis ( dry , scaly skin ) , lentigines uneven pigmentation . While morphologically skin biopsy cytology sample show minimal change , molecular level know SD characterize small clone keratinocytes carry mutation P53 gene . An optical technology call Partial Wave Spectroscopy ( PWS ) probe nanoscale structure order ten hundred nanometer . PWS light back-scattering technique us light reflect tissue sample . The measured biomarker sensitive cytosolic nucleic architecture within cell quantifies nanoscale disorder , conventional light microscopy fail appreciate . PWS allow identify various grade structural disorder nanoscale level colonic pulmonary premalignant cell sample . Using PWS aim study spectrum cutaneous SD patient high risk SCC development . Since squamous dysplasia difficult assess routine histology cytopathology grade system squamous dysplasia routine histology cytology available , propose ass value PWS new sensitive imaging technique . By identify degree SD molecular level , may able intervene close surveillance , early treatment chemoprevention strategy achieve low morbidity mean few small skin cancer .</detailed_description>
