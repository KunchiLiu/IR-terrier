	<brief_summary>Background : - Parkinson disease ( PD ) affect half million Americans , cause slow movement , tremor , stiffness , trouble walk . Currently , symptom measure physical exam , unreliable require office visit . Researchers want study different way measure PD symptom , use home-testing machine call QMAT device . It test quickly someone move different task . Researchers study test compare physical exam test whether device detect change PD symptom time . Objectives : - To see home test device use evaluate Parkinson disease symptom . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year old PD . Design : - Participants 22 clinic visit 5 year . Each visit take 3 hour . Visits schedule along visit another study . - At visit 1 , participant learn use QMAT device send test information clinic computer . The device computer screen , button , peg . Participants get device take home accessory . - Participants learn 2 QMAT test . For one , press key fast possible . For , move peg hole . The test take total 20 minute . - Participants take test home , 2 time day week , medication , . - A study coordinator monitor participant computer data discuss at-home test clinic visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Movement Disorders Using QMAT At-Home Testing Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The purpose protocol improve understand pathophysiology movement disorder assess movement Parkinson disease perform small behavioral exercise objectively measure movement utilize QMAT home test device . These device provide Kinetics Foundation . We develop series motor task perform QMAT , home-based computer module , data patient movement collect frequently prospectively without obligate patient come medical center . The study design observational nature . The QMAT device implement respond interest objectify test monitor , analyze , understand physiological aspect Parkinson disease . We conduct : - Training patient perform task QMAT device transmit data home . - Training investigator prior experience use system - Testing use QMAT device may increase knowledge disease process , responsiveness treatment helpful patient progress evaluation analyze data collect home test . This protocol include non-invasive technique minimal risk participant . The technique pilot part 10-N-0009 protocol , Physiological Investigations Movement Disorders . Study Population We intend study patient diagnosis Parkinson Disease . We enroll 60 participant order obtain 48 patient complete study . Design We assign train study participant use QMAT device home . This portable device simple keyboard pegboard interface , store data patient performance home . There 2 task perform use device . The pegboard task involve transfer peg hole one side device opposite side device . The finger tap test digitography task involve subject press key keyboard . At enrollment study , time schedule discuss participant regard schedule home test require conduct . We provide device , component , data storage thumb-drive participant . Outcome measure i. Bradykinesia ( fine motor movement ) : The component apparatus test fine motor control involve finger pad tap alternate fashion patient 30 second . The primary outcome variable mean keystroke velocity ( complete alternate cycles/testing period , express cm/sec . Secondary outcome mean frequency express Hz , mean strike duration , express m/sec temporal variation duration finger strike frequency ( issue fatigue ) express coefficient variation ( SD/mean ) . Variation velocity express SD . ii . Complex movement : ( Pegboard plug device ) : The At-Home device also contain plug task . Primary outcome : mean movement velocity express second per plug cycle . This measure analyze statistically movement correct outlier response error . A secondary outcome also defatigation ( i.e. , linear change speed test session , express percent cycle-time . The variance speed provide standard deviation . A regression analysis allow estimate part variance declare linear change complete task .</detailed_description>
