	<brief_summary>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV ) represent common cause labyrinthine vertigo lifetime prevalence 2.4 percent . Onset common fifth seventh decade life . The disease major handicap affect patient , cause great expense society . The traditional manual treatment reposition maneuver greatly improved possibility treatment BPPV last decade . However patient still difficult diagnose treat , health reason undergo traditional manual treatment . In perspective demand reliable , effective precise method treat semicircular canal differentiate patient group , technique continuous development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BPPV Treatment Biaxial Rotational Chair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There extend research improve technique develop well reliable method diagnose treat BPPV efficiently . An important part technique evolution development biaxial rotational chair treat patient regardless health problem . Mechanical assistance chair design diagnose , differentiate treat precisely form positional vertigo . The patient strap chair fit infrared video goggles identify quantify nystagmus different position . Dr. John M. Epley develop Epley Omniax System , automate , power driven , multi axial patient position device move patient position treat affect canal . This chair electronically manage . Another mechanical assistance chair , TRV chair , develop Thomas Richard-Vitton Marseille France , become commercially available 2005 . This chair vertical horizontal axis rotation lockable preset position . It manually handle swivel two ax plane semicircular canal 360 degree . Velocity rotation regulate freely . The TRV chair use 34 center worldwide today . Bergen ( Norway ) first place North-Europe acquire chair , use since December 2009 . In 2013 Rigshospitalet Denmark start use TRV chair well Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet , chair 2013 . The TRV chair open treatment previously possible . The aim study : - Evaluate presence positional nystagmus normal population - Evaluate efficacy D-BBC treatment compare S-BBC treatment lateral canal BPPV TRV chair - Examine serum level vitamin D BPPV patient - Give detailed description method .</detailed_description>
