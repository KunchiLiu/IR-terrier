	<brief_summary>Nitric oxide believe contribute regulation blood flow selective binding circulate hemoglobin ( form S-nitrosohemoglobin , SNO-Hb ) release PO2-dependent manner . This study design test hypothesis measure effect hypoxia exercise forearm blood flow depletion SNO-Hb use oral N-acetylcysteine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NO show associate erythrocyte form SNO-Hb deliver vasomotor change erythrocytes pass physiologic O2 gradient . The aim study transiently deplete circulate SNO-Hb level prove level directly link normal physiological vasodilation occur response brief hypoxia occur moderate exercise . This study perform healthy volunteer especially predispose cardiovascular respiratory condition may change vasomotor response hypoxia . Systemic blood flow approximate use non-invasive forearm venous occlusion plethysmography perform initial gather baseline data . The participant undergo 4 day 600 mg BID oral N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) solution treatment act bait reactant NO group bind hemoglobin ( SNO-Hb ) undergo retesting forearm plethysmography . At time blood flow measurement , arterial blood sample also gather via arterial catheter insert two testing day determine SNO-Hb level . Statistical analysis include measure blunt hypoxia response SNO-Hb level use baseline test self-control participant . Large scale human placebo-controlled trial high-dose oral NAC ( 8000 mg/day ) period 12 month show clinically significant adverse reaction , much less propose study .</detailed_description>
