	<brief_summary>This study compare two dos pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) versus docetaxel participant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) experience disease progression platinum-containing systemic therapy . Participants assign randomly receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every three week ( Q3W ) , pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 Q3W . This study use adaptive trial design total number participant randomize depend upon demonstration sufficient objective response interim analysis . Based positive outcome Overall Survival ( OS ) analysis , Protocol Amendment 12 ( effective date : 09 Dec 2015 ) enable eligible participant allocate docetaxel experienced disease progression , permit crossover receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W long Inclusion/Exclusion criterion meet . These participant participate Cross-Over Phase . The primary study hypothesis pembolizumab prolongs OS Progression-free Survival ( PFS ) per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors Version 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) independent radiologist ' review previously-treated participant NSCLC strongly positive program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) stratum compare docetaxel participant whose tumor express PD-L1 compare docetaxel .</brief_summary>
