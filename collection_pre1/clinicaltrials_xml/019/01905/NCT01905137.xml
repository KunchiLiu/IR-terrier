	<detailed_description>Objective : Primary objective : To evaluate change patient-reported pelvic pain follow pelvic floor injection 200 unit Botox compare 20cc normal saline . Secondary objective : To evaluate change patient-reported pelvic pain follow Botox injection conjunction pelvic floor physical therapy compare saline injection physical therapy . Hypothesis We hypothesize woman Botox treatment arm , compare saline arm , great decrease patient-reported pain palpation painful levator ani muscle group two week injection . To test hypothesis measure patient-reported pain palpation levator ani muscle group baseline two week follow injection . Pain assessed 10-point visual analog scale . We compare baseline two-week pain measurement painful muscle group . We hypothesize addition physical therapy , woman Botox treatment arm , compare saline arm , great decrease patient-reported pain palpation painful levator ani muscle group 12 week injection . To test hypothesis measure patient-reported pain palpation levator ani muscle group baseline 12 week follow injection . Pain assessed 10-point visual analog scale . We compare baseline 12-week pain measurement painful muscle group . Intervention : All patient screen eligibility routine office visit . If meet eligibility criterion , offer enrollment . At visit , patient counsel conservative treatment option deal irritative voiding symptom , bowel symptom , pain . The counseling offer standardized patient . After patient consent , undergo initial evaluation pelvic floor physical therapist . Patients return office visit receive treatment . The patient pretreated 100mg topical Lidocaine hydrochloride jelly , 2 % , vagina 15 minute prior injection . A designated medical assistant open opaque seal envelope determine whether patient randomize Botox saline arm . The medical assistant draw appropriate solution—either 20mL saline 200 unit Botox A dilute preservative-free saline , achieve concentration 10 unit per mL . Both Botox saline drawn 2 unlabeled 10mL syrinx order ensure physician remain blinded treatment arm assignment . The saline Botox inject coccygeus , piriformis , obturator internus , puborectalis , iliococcygeus , pubococcygeus muscle bilaterally total 1-2mL per muscle group . Using digital vaginal palpation , muscle inject locate care take locate tender contract point muscle fiber . The index finger use palpation 20-gauge pudendal block needle guide advance target site pierce vaginal mucosa intend muscle group . The needle place intend muscle direct palpation injection 1-2mL aliquot . Study Design : This double-blinded , randomize control trial . Participants randomize either Botox saline ratio 1:1 use computer-generated block randomization . The statistician create sequentially number opaque seal envelope conceal group assignment.Study visit Baseline visit Once determine eligible , patient offer enrollment study . After consent form sign , obtain study data . Participants see physical therapist designate pelvic floor physical therapy center evaluate pelvic floor prior intervention . Injection visit Following pelvic floor physical therapy assessment , participant return urogynecology office injection saline Botox specify . Two-week post-injection visit At two week , patient return outcome assessment . Four-week post-injection visit Patients return 4 week outcome assessment 2 week . After 4-week visit , participant start pelvic floor physical therapy . They go physical therapy total 8 session , do close weekly possible . Twelve-week post-injection visit At 12 week patient return outcome assessment . After outcome data collect , provider patient unblinded . Patients randomized placebo group offer 200 Units Botox injection cost . These 32 patient encourage continue weekly physical therapy 8 week follow Botox injection . We ask participant return 2 week 12 week injection outcome assessment . During visit collect data 2-week 12-week visit .</detailed_description>
