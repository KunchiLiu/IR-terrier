	<brief_summary>The overarching goal program project grant development technology lead new method study , detect , treat type 2 diabetes , integration hypothesis-driven diabetes research project . Project 4 grant , lead Dr. Craig Malloy UTSW , develop apply new technology MRI test core hypothesis development insulin resistance people . The long-term goal develop technology monitor metabolism skeletal muscle , brain liver use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) 3 Tesla 7 Tesla MRI scanner . These advance imaging method allow researcher take picture inside body measure metabolism occur MRI scanner . Standard clinical MRI medical diagnosis treatment perform 1 Tesla 3 Tesla MRI scanner . A primary goal 7 Tesla research program develop group protocol investigate specific metabolic pathway adipose ( fat ) tissue , skeletal muscle liver . This study do improve method image measure molecule 3 Tesla 7 Tesla scanner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarching goal program project grant development technology lead new method study , detect , treat type 2 diabetes , integration hypothesis-driven diabetes research project . The research lead Administrative Core team ( Core C ) direction Dr. Newgard Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition Metabolism Center Duke ensure integration analysis Projects Cores . Research within PPG support two establish scientific core laboratory include mass spectrometry ( MS ) -based metabolic profiling core ( Core B ) Duke Stedman Center Metabolomics Core Laboratory direct James Bain , Ph.D. Metabolomic flux/Imaging Core ( Core A ) Advanced Imaging Research Center ( AIRC ) University Texas Southwestern Medical Center direction Dean Sherry , Ph.D . Projects 1-3 current program continue animal model work previous research Project 4 , conduct UTSWMC , add human study component well additional animal study . The goal Project 1 ( lead Dr. Newgard/Duke ) collaborate project core fully understand metabolic molecular change lead perturbed branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) homeostasis loss insulin sensitivity animal model , thereby lead well understand possible cause/effect relationship BCAA metabolic disease . The goal Project 2 ( lead Dr. Muoio/Duke ) , also work component program , test hypothesis excessive mitochondrial catabolism lipid BCAA play central role trigger mitochondrial stress , insulin resistance eventual metabolic failure skeletal muscle pathological progression diet-induced obesity . Project 3 ( lead Dr. Burgess/UTSWMC ) use tools Cores A B help define temporal sequence change mitochondrial metabolism liver development hepatic insulin resistance , also dissect contribution key signal event ( insulin receptor engagement , mTOR activation ) nutrient ( BCAA , lipid ) process . Project 4 ( lead Dr. Malloy UTSWMC ) develop apply novel high-field 7T NMR spectroscopy/metabolic flux analysis technology help test three core hypothesis development insulin resistance emanate Projects 1-3 ( animal study ) human subject . For project 4 , current request establish protocol vary site 13C label several physiological molecule : glucose , lactate , acetate , pyruvate , octanoate . All molecule undergo oxidation citric acid cycle safely administer human subject . The intent study particular 13C label pattern molecule 70 subject determine downstream product ( 13C bicarbonate 13C glutamate ) due oxidation mitochondrion detect skeletal muscle blood NMR analysis . Additional work include use 31P image probe mitochondrial function measure phosphorus-containing metabolite , well pH metabolic flux activity non-invasively . Aim 3 project commence September 2014 cross-sectional study overweight human measurement branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) test mitochondrial function skeletal muscle use 7T 31P imaging insulin clamp ( infusion glucose tracer ) . Subjects Aim 3 phase study 25 60 year age . These new high-field MR technology integrate largely hand understand mitochondrial function liver skeletal muscle project translate biological/mechanistic finding grant project human study . This protocol primarily technology development . Most subject undergo 7T MR exam optimal information expect strong field strength . The 3T MR scanner use protocol establish comparison .</detailed_description>
