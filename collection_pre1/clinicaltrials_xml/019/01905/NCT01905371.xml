	<brief_summary>This NIH Pilot Clinical Trial Grant design provide data permit rationale design subsequent efficacy study . The purpose project determine potential benefit amphetamine combine physical therapy enhance motor recovery patient admit inpatient rehabilitation 10 30 day hemispheric ischemic stroke . The study hypotheses : 1 , The addition treatment d-amphetamine result least 12.6 point improvement Fugl-Meyer motor score 3 month stroke . 2 , There clinically significant increase frequency serious adverse event associate treatment d-amphetamine would preclude test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose Pilot Grant collect data critical design subsequent full-scale clinical trial test efficacy treatment amphetamine combine physical therapy facilitate poststroke motor recovery . When combined task-relevant experience , single dose amphetamine give 24 hr follow unilateral sensorimotor cortex ablation rat result endure enhancement motor recovery . This amphetamine effect extend functional deficit occur follow focal lesion produce variety mechanism include ischemic brain injury , lesion affect area cortex , behavior . Laboratory study show certain drug amphetamine may facilitate recovery , class drug may harmful . Clinical study suggest similar detrimental drug effect may occur human recover stroke . Three small study impact treatment amphetamine poststroke recovery carry . Two find beneficial effect third negative . These study differ significant way review referenced section proposal . The present study design base small study . Using multicenter , block-randomized , placebo-controlled design , pilot study : 1 . Refine intervention strategy develop Pilot Grant base best available laboratory preliminary clinical data . 2 . Refine target patient population . 3 . Gain information permit accurate sample size calculation ( estimate pilot study ) subsequent trial . 4 . Refine outcome measure , site monitoring technique , data consistency protocol , data management procedure . 5 . Obtain data support safety propose intervention . This study several hypothesis . 1 . Patients treat d-amphetamine combined physical therapy improve recovery motor function compare similar patient treat placebo combine physical therapy measure 90 day hemispheric ischemic stroke . 2 . There clinically significant increase frequency serious adverse event associate treatment d-amphetamine would preclude test regimen . Secondary goal include : 1 . Refinement target patient population . 2 . Gain information permit accurate sample size calculation ( estimate pilot study ) subsequent trial . 3 . Refinement outcome measure , site monitoring technique , data consistency protocol , data management procedure .</detailed_description>
