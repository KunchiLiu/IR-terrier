	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy IQP- AK-102 Reducing Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Appetite regulation play important role determine food intake , complex process influence biological , behavioral environmental stimulus . Satiation ( intrameal satiety ) define process feel full subsequently stop food consumption eating , therefore reduce hunger limit energy consumption meal . On hand , satiety precisely intermeal satiety , delay onset possibly reduce consumption next meal . High viscosity bulk food component dietary fibre expect elicit strong satiation/satiety macronutrients clear liquid . Due unique physicochemical property , dietary fibre recognize potential ingredient help enhance sensation satiety upper gut increase gastric distension delay gastric emptying , subsequently reduce food intake , eventually lead weight loss . The investigational product formulate IQP-AK-102 , proprietary , patent pending combination three soluble fibre . In-vitro study show synergistic property fibres IQP-AK-102 . When consume orally , IQP-AK-102 capsule dissolve stomach release fibre . Once hydrate , fibre swell form thick , viscous indigestible gel structure stomach . This physical structure result increase gastric distension delay gastric empty induces satiety fullness . However unique composition IQP-AK-102 evaluate human clinical study . The objective placebo control , double blind study confirm benefit IQP-AK-102 weight loss promote satiety manage appetite . In study , 120 overweight obese subject ( 60 per study arm ) test investigate IQP-AK-102 effective reduce body weight period 12 week .</detailed_description>
