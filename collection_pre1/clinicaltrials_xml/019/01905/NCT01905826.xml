	<brief_summary>Background : - GATA2 deficiency genetic disorder cause problem person immune system body system . Some people disorder develop problem . Others wide range health problem , skin problem , hear loss , cancer . These problem happen age . Researchers want study GATA2 deficiency well understand type health problem cause , cause problem people others , different age . Objectives : - To improve understand GATA2 deficiency well diagnostic test treatment future . Eligibility : - People 2 year age old GATA2 gene mutation certain health condition commonly see people mutation blood relative . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect see whether participant GATA2 genetic mutation . Several test may recommend , participant decline take . - Participants eligible receive standard care GATA2 deficiency protocol . They may eligible clinical trial National Institutes Health well . - Participants regular study visit year evaluate GATA2 deficiency . Participants take part study least 3 year 15 year . At follow-up visit , participant fill questionnaire take physical exam blood test . Other test may perform need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Study GATA2 Deficiency Related Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mutations GATA2 , critical hematopoietic transcription factor , underlie complex congenital disorder characterize immunodeficiency , bone marrow failure , lymphatic/vascular dysfunction . Patients GATA2 deficiency may suffer strike variety disease include severe recurrent infection , myelodysplasia/leukemia , pulmonary alveolar proteinosis , lymphedema , sensorineural hearing loss , possibly susceptibility malignancy , autoimmune disorder , thrombotic event , miscarriage . Mutations GATA2 appear fully penetrant , expressivity remarkably variable , even among related individual . Disease may also manifest nearly age range early childhood late adulthood , reason remain poorly understood . While considerable progress make towards well understand complex congenital disorder , many important question remain unanswered : What full spectrum clinical disease associate pathophysiology ? What account remarkable variability age onset clinical phenotype ? What optimal strategy disease diagnosis management ? This natural history protocol design characterize clinical phenotype GATA2 deficiency , good understand reason phenotypic variability , good understand disease progression time , standardize diagnostic evaluation , facilitate screening risk relative . Up 300 male female great equal 2 year old proven mutation GATA2 clinical laboratory characteristic strongly consistent GATA2 deficiency initially undergo series baseline laboratory test diagnostic procedure NIH . Follow-up laboratory test conduct yearly visit 15 year ; additional follow-up diagnostic procedure conduct base clinical need .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Males female great equal 2 year old must meet follow criterion eligible participation study : Have mutation GATA2 proven genetic testing ( previous test result accept ) OR meet follow criterion : Clinical characteristic strongly consistent GATA2 deficiency per follow criterion discretion principal investigator ( PI ) . Individuals without GATA2 mutation must past present history 1 follow consider study enrollment : Disseminated NTM invasive fungal infection . Severe recurrent HPV herpesvirus infection . MDS , AML , CMML . Biopsyproven PAP . Laboratory characteristic strongly consistent GATA2 deficiency per follow criterion . Individuals without GATA2 mutation must 1 follow consider study enrollment : Absolute monocyte count &lt; 240 cells/microL . Absolute B lymphocyte count &lt; 60 cells/microL . Absolute NK lymphocyte count &lt; 126 cells/microL . Agree undergo genetic testing . Allow sample store future research . EXCLUSION CRITERIA RELATIVE : As part study may obtain medical record , questionnaire , blood work , urine , buccal swab , skin biopsy bone marrow biopsy blood relative , male female , great equal 2 year old , patient study . This allow test family member GATA2 mutation well screen potential bone marrow transplant donor , relative study . If relative positive GATA2 could become patient study . No invasive study ( e.g. , bone marrow biopsy ) do unaffected relative unless indicate bone marrow donor transplantation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA SUBJECT : Individuals condition take medication , opinion investigator , contraindicate participation study exclude .</criteria>
