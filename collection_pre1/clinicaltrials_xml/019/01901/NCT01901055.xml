	<brief_summary>Diabetes self-management important help adult type 2 diabetes achieve glucose control . Obstructive sleep apnea often co-exists type 2 diabetes may act barrier diabetes self-management glucose control . We examine treatment obstructive sleep apnea continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , combine diabetes education , result improve diabetes self-management glucose control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While diabetes self-management improve refine last 30 year , many person T2DM continue difficulty achieve glycemic goal . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) high prevalence among adult type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) associate excessive daytime sleepiness , impaired mood , decrease vigilance , reduce functional outcome . The degree OSA affect diabetes self-management , know determinant glycemic control , remain unstudied . The effective treatment OSA , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , result improve self-reported daytime functioning . However , effect CPAP treatment reception diabetes education remain unknown . The underlying premise propose study new investigator OSA hinders diabetes self-management adult T2DM . Our goal improve understanding effect OSA diabetes self-management determine efficacy CPAP treatment improve diabetes outcomes adult treat CPAP compare sham-CPAP . Expanding understanding effect sleep disturbance diabetes self-management may lead improve guideline screen treatment OSA increasingly large portion population diabetes</detailed_description>
