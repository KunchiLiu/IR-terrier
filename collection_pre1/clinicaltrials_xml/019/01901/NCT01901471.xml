	<brief_summary>The size acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) relate ischemia injury induce tissue reperfusion . These reperfusion 's injury reduce injection cyclosporin A ( CsA ) time reperfusion . This post-conditioning reduces final infarct size 20 40 % . This demonstrated STEMI patient non-complicated cardiogenic shock . Early revascularization AMI complicate cardiogenic shock improve short-term long term survival reduce size myocardial infarction . The hypothesis study administration Cyclosporin A patient , addition mechanical reperfusion , likely reduce severity multi-organ failure associate cardiogenic shock improve clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
