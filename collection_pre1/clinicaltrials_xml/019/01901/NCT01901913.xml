	<brief_summary>The MDLAP ( MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas ) system automatic system regulate glucose level delivery insulin operable clinical trial setting . The safety system prove previous inpatient outpatient trial large number patient . In current study aim optimize post-prandial closed-loop glycemic control develop automate MD-bolus calculator evaluate safety efficacy control postprandial blood glucose use together MD-Logic artificial pancreas system type 1 diabetes patient . The study consist pilot study two segment main study segment . The aim segment detail : 1 . Pilot Study - Segment 1 - Hybrid meal bolus ratio The aim segment evaluate efficacy safety different pre-meal bolus dosing compare full closed-loop operation meal announcement . 2 . Pilot Study - Segment 2 - Insulin dose meal In segment would like test optimal distribution insulin delivery meal . 3 . Main study - Segment 3 - Automatic bolus calculator In main segment study use result conclusion previous two pilot segment develop MD-Bolus Calculator closed-loop control use . The safety efficacy automate insulin bolus calculator test randomized cross-over study compare postprandial glycemic control MDLAP without use MD-Bolus Calculator .</brief_summary>
