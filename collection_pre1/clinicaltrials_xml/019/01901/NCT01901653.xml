	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety tolerability SC16LD6.5 different dose level patient small cell lung cancer whose cancer progress recur follow standard chemotherapy . Once safe tolerable dose determine , anti-cancer activity SC16LD6.5 assess measure extent tumor shrinkage . SC16LD6.5 antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) . The antibody ( SC16 ) target protein appear expressed surface small cell lung cancer assess use immunohistochemical assay . The drug , D6.5 , potent form chemotherapy , specifically DNA-damaging agent , cell cycle independent . ADC 's theoretically provide precise delivery chemotherapy cancer cell , possibly improve effectiveness relative toxicity .</brief_summary>
