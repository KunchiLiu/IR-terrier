	<brief_summary>The primary aim LIFE study compare low-income African American diabetes patient lifestyle intervention group standard care control group change glycemic control 12-months . We hypothesize , average , participant intervention group achieve great glycemic control 12-months relative baseline A1c , control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Improvement Through Food Exercise ( LIFE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project randomize control trial test innovative lifestyle intervention achieve sustain improvement glycemic control among low-income African American diabetes patient . The LIFE ( Lifestyle Improvement Food Exercise ) program diabetes self-management program focus diet exercise , inform anthropological research model food health among low-income African-Americans . Pilot work demonstrate LIFE Program effective improve glycemic control among low-income African Americans 6-months . The main goal current study determine whether LIFE Program achieve sustain improvement glycemic control 12 month . The trial randomize low-income African American adult diabetes control group , receive standard diabetes education , intervention group , receive LIFE Program ( 28 group meeting peer support telephone call ) follow 6-month maintenance phase ( quarterly group session monthly peer support phone call ) . The primary aim propose research compare low-income African American diabetes patient receive LIFE Program standard care control group change glycemic control 12 month . Our primary hypothesis patient intervention group achieve change A1c baseline less patient control group . Secondary aim compare low-income African American diabetes patient receive LIFE Program standard care control group ( ) change glycemic control 18 month ; ( b ) change physical activity total energy intake 12 month ; ( c ) change physical activity total energy intake 18 month ; ( ) obtain estimate need subsequent trial , include weight , blood pressure , diabetes-related hospitalization . For secondary aim hypothesize ) intervention group achieve mean 18-month change A1C less change control group ; b ) 12 month , great proportion intervention patient achieve activity goal 150 minute moderate activity per week , intervention group achieve great reduction baseline mean total energy intake control group ; c ) 18 month , great proportion intervention patient achieve activity goal 150 minute moderate activity per week , intervention group achieve great reduction baseline mean total energy intake control group .</detailed_description>
