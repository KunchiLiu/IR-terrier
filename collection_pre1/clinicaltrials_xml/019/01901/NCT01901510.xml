	<brief_title>Panchromoendoscopy Using Oral Indigo Carmine Mixed With Polyethylene Glycol Prep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colon cancer occur 5 % US population . Currently colon cancer screen recommend age 50 year old patient average risk . Colonoscopy consider gold standard test colon cancer screen . This partly colonoscopy detect polyp cancer precursor also remove , thereby detect cancer precursor prevent cancer . Unfortunately recent data suggest colonoscopy miss significant percentage polyp , especially right side colon . It think one major reason miss polyp right side colon fact flat sessile serrate adenoma , difficult protrude polyps identify ordinary colon preparation colonoscope . Chromoendoscopy application dye colonoscopy enhance detection polyp . It show improve detection polyp thus potential improve performance colonoscopy increase detection difficult detect polyp . It however cumbersome time consuming , discourage use . Indigo carmine , one commonly use dye , actually FDA approve food colorant consume orally . It minimally absorb . In addition use intravenously diagnosis injury urinary system rapidly excrete kidney . The investigator believe take orally well tolerate , dye absorb rapidly excrete kidney thus quickly eliminate without side effect . Effective stain colon indigo carmine increase detection polyp could change current standard care screen colon cancer .</detailed_description>
