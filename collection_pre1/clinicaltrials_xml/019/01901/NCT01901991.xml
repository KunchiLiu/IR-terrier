	<brief_summary>Each year Danish mammography-screening programme identifies large number patient small non-palpable breast cancer precancerous lesion . The majority patient suitable breast conserving surgery ( BCS ) . The object BCS remove suspicious lesion completely without remove excess healthy breast tissue . To obtain accurate lesion localization essential . Until today standard procedure Denmark wire guide localization ( WGL ) . Although method utilized number year several disadvantage . Often inaccurate lesion localization lead incomplete lesion removal ( positive margin ) subsequently reoperation . It postpone additional systemic treatment , offer operation . Other disadvantage poor cosmetic outcome inconvenient plan patient department involve . The wire need place day operation , decrease flexibility procedure . The purpose study test new method name radioactive seed localization ( RSL ) . The method use small titanium seed contain radioactive iodine . It place centre lesion , operation , surgeon locate handheld gamma probe . The seed place day advance , mean flexible course treatment . The method seem promising regard reoperation rate , need test . Hypothesis : RSL accurate method , localization nonpalpable breast lesion , WGL . Using RSL obtains , great extent , adequate negative margin , result reduced number re-operations . The study perform randomised clinical trial , two method compare . The trial perform department breast surgery Rigshospitalet include patient nonpalpable breast lesion . Besides reoperation rate , duration surgical procedure amount remove breast tissue compare .</brief_summary>
