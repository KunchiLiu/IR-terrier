	<brief_title>Feasibility Implantable Myoelectric Sensors Control Upper Limb Prostheses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study assess feasibility advanced prosthesis control system aim development intuitive functional prosthetic device . Tiny ( 2.5 mm 16 mm ) Implantable Myoelectric Sensors ( IMES ) implant residual forearm muscle three transradial amputee subject . These device wirelessly transmit electrical muscle signal electromechanical prosthetic wrist hand . Following two-week recovery implantation six eight IMES residual forearm muscle , subject initiate seven month train . Subjects first train approximately month use bench-top IMES system . When receive custom-fit IMES Prosthesis ( include electromechanical wrist hand ) subject initiate six month additional training . Subjects give option use IMES Prosthesis another sixteen month . The usability functionality prosthetic system evaluate throughout study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient health care beneficiary Walter Reed National Military Medical Center . 2 . Patient transradial amputation onethird great residual forearm length determine contralateral side . 3 . Patient 's residual forearm anatomy ( base number size residual muscle ) support implantation control least six IMES ( opinion Investigator ) . This criterion verify studyspecific screen test . 4 . Patient age 18 . 5 . Patient speak comprehend English . 6 . Patient willing capable providing inform consent . 7 . Patient undergone amputee rehabilitation , include trained wear use bodypowered myoelectric prosthesis . 8 . Patient report wear upper limb prosthesis least two hour per day . 9 . Unilateral amputation preserve function nonamputated arm ; preserve function investigator opinion whether patient : ability independently doff prosthesis , enough dexterity nonamputated arm attach detach Prosthetic Control Interface ( PCI ) cable operate PCI power switch , dexterity remove replace PCI battery . 10 . Patient willing capable EMG needle insert forearm . 11 . In opinion Investigator , patient cognitively capable operate IMES Prosthesis . 12 . Patient willing comply wear schedule investigational device . 13 . Patient willing capable travel investigational site study visit outline protocol . 1 . Patient less three month amputation surgery major injury target residual limb . 2 . Patient major injury proximal level amputation . 3 . In opinion Investigator , patient prone skin breakdown target residual limb . 4 . Known nerve transection palsy may cause deinnervation muscle target residual limb . 5 . Known genetic neuromuscular disorder ( e.g . multiple sclerosis , myasthenia gravis , muscular dystrophy ) . 6 . Patient bleed clot disorder . 7 . Bilateral upper extremity amputation . 8 . Patient major psychological disorder poorly control PTSD , schizophrenia , paranoia cooperative status inconsistent . 9 . Patient active implant ( e.g . pacemaker , implanted cardiac defibrillator [ ICD ] , neurostimulator , drug infusion device ) . 10 . Patients metal fragment metal implant ( e.g . orthopedic hardware ) locate within residual forearm exclude . The absence metal shall confirm xray entire affected arm . 11 . Patients metal affect upper arm consider casebycase basis . An xray entire affect arm shall provide Sponsor assess potential interaction metal Coil 's magnetic field . 12 . Patient history adverse reaction anesthetic agent . 13 . Patient recently currently participate research may influence response either study intervention , harmful subject way . 14 . A female patient pregnant , nursing , plan become pregnant course study . 15 . In opinion Investigator , subject suitable candidate study , reason residual limb infection , significant pain , significant proximal nerve injury soft tissue damage , significant scarring , poor health skin envelope .</criteria>
