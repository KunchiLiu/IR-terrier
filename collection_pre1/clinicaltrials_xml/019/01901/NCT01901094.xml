	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study axillary lymph node dissection see well work compare axillary radiation therapy treat patient node-positive breast cancer treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery . Lymph node dissection may remove cancer cell spread nearby lymph node patient breast cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . This study evaluate whether radiation therapy effective lymph node dissection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Axillary Lymph Node Dissection With Axillary Radiation Patients With Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Outline : - All patient undergo surgery identify sentinel lymph node ( ) . If lymph node ( sentinel non-sentinel ) determine positive intra-operative pathology patient registered/randomized intra-operatively . - Patients sentinel lymph node identify registered/randomized study . - Patients whose sentinel lymph node status be/is determine intra- operatively , undergone ALND , least one lymph node ( sentinel non-sentinel ) find positive final pathology review registered/randomized post-operatively . - Patients whose sentinel lymph node status find negative intra-operatively undergone ALND , least one lymph node ( sentinel non-sentinel ) find positive final pathology review registered/randomized post-operatively . - ALND perform prior registration/randomization . - Patients determine negative lymph node final pathology registered/randomized , offer participation another cooperative group trial . The primary secondary objective study describe . Please see `` Arms '' section detail description treatment regimen . Primary Objective : - To evaluate whether radiation undissected axilla regional lymph node inferior axillary lymph node dissection radiation regional lymph node dissect axilla term invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval patient positive SLN ( ) completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate whether radiation undissected axilla regional lymph node inferior axillary lymph node dissection radiation regional lymph node dissect axilla term incidence invasive loco-regional recurrence patient positive SLN ( ) completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy - To obtain estimate distribution residual disease burden score treatment arm - To estimate distribution overall survival treatment arm Patients may receive adjuvant ancillary therapy appropriate per protocol . Adjuvant Therapy : - Adjuvant endocrine therapy : Patients hormone receptor ( ER and/or PR ) positive disease receive minimum 5 year standard endocrine therapy ( experimental agents/regimens permit ) . Endocrine therapy begin follow completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy surgery , either , radiation therapy discretion oncologist . Selection agent treat physician 's discretion . - Patients HER 2 positive disease complete total one year trastuzumab therapy ( neoadjuvant adjuvant period ) . - Chemotherapy , biologic therapy vaccine therapy adjuvant setting allow . Patients wish receive therapy surgery must go study time initiation . Ancillary Therapy : - Patients receive full supportive care , include transfusion blood blood product , erythropoetin ( unless otherwise specify protocol ) , antibiotic , antiemetic , etc . appropriate . Patients follow 5 year completion radiation therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PreRegistration Eligibility Criteria : 1 . Patients ≥ 18 year age 2 . Clinical stage T13 N1 M0 breast cancer diagnosis ( prior start neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stag 7th edition 3 . No inflammatory breast cancer 4 . No malignancy within 5 year registration exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix 5 . All patient must axillary ultrasound fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) core needle biopsy axillary lymph node document axillary metastasis time diagnosis , prior 14 day start neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Note : Biopsy intramammary node fulfill eligibility criterion . 6 . Patients must estrogen receptor , progesterone receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] and/or fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] evaluate diagnostic core biopsy prior start neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Note : If HER2 status clearly determine ( ie equivocal/indeterminate ) , patient enrol . 7 . Patients must complete planned chemotherapy prior surgery . Sandwich chemotherapy allow ( i.e . chemotherapy plan give surgery ) . Patients must complete least 4 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy consist anthracycline and/or taxanebased regimen without evidence disease progression breast lymph node . NOTE : Delays/dose modification due toxicities/adverse event allow long minimum 4 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy administer . More 4 cycle NAC may administer discretion treat medical oncologist . 8 . Patients HER2 positive tumor must receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab trastuzumab + pertuzumab approve antiHER2 therapy ( either portion neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen ) . Therapy must Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve targeted antiHER2 therapy , additional therapy allow nontrastuzumab regimen administer context Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve clinical trial . 9 . All patient must clinically negative axilla ( palpable lymph node bulky adenopathy ) physical examination document completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . NOTE : An ultrasound axilla require completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . If perform , finding NOT impact eligibility . 10 . No neoadjuvant endocrine therapy 11 . No neoadjuvant radiation therapy 12 . No sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) surgery/excisional biopsy pathological confirmation axillary status prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy 13 . No prior history ipsilateral breast cancer ( invasive disease ductal carcinoma situ [ DCIS ] ) . Lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) benign breast disease allow . 14 . No prior ipsilateral axillary surgery , excisional biopsy lymph node ( ) treatment hidradenitis . 15 . No history prior concurrent contralateral invasive breast cancer . Benign breast disease , LCIS DCIS contralateral breast allow . 16 . Patients must pregnant nursing . A negative pregnancy test require prior registration woman childbearing potential . Note : Perimenopausal woman must amenorrheic &gt; 12 month consider childbearing potential . 17 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) ( Zubrod ) performance status 01 . 18 . Required PreRegistration Laboratory Values : Serum urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( ßHCG ) Negative woman childbearing potential IntraOperative Registration/Randomization Criteria : 1 . Breast surgery ( lumpectomy mastectomy ) sentinel lymph node surgery must complete within 56 day completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . 2 . A minimum 1 sentinel node maximum 6 total node ( sentinel + nonsentinel ) identify excised surgeon . Patients identifiable sentinel lymph node proceed Registration/Randomization . 3 . At least one lymph node ( sentinel nonsentinel ) metastasis great 0.2 mm great dimension identify intraoperative pathologic assessment . Note : Isolated tumor cell ( metastasis less equal 0.2 mm ) treat node negative disease ( N0i+ ) . Axillary lymph node dissection [ ALND ] perform prior Registration/Randomization . PostOperative Registration/Randomization Criteria : 1 . For case ALND perform one follow true : intraoperative evaluation sentinel lymph node could be/was perform final pathology identify positive lymph node ( sentinel nonsentinel ) metastasis great 0.2 mm hematoxylin eosin stain ( H &amp; E ) OR lymph node ( sentinel nonsentinel ) consider negative intraoperative evaluation find positive final pathology ( metastasis great 0.2 mm H &amp; E ) Breast surgery ( lumpectomy mastectomy ) sentinel lymph node surgery must complete within 56 day completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy . At least one lymph node ( sentinel nonsentinel ) metastasis great 0.2 mm great dimension identify H &amp; E stain final pathology ( case intraoperative evaluation perform , negative completion dissection perform ) . Among minimum 1 maximum 6 node ( sentinel nonsentinel ) identify excised surgeon , 8 lymph node ( sentinel nonsentinel ) find pathologist actually excise . Note : Isolated tumor cell ( metastasis less equal 0.2 mm ) treat node negative disease ( N0i+ ) . For patient also undergo contralateral breast surgery , invasive disease find contralateral breast , patient eligible registration/randomization .</criteria>
