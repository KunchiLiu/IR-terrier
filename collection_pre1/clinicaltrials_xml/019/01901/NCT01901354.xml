	<brief_summary>This study compare two ventilator mode mechanically ventilate patient acute lung injury . Acute lung injury ( ALI ) condition lung badly injure able absorb oxygen way healthy lung . About 25 % patient ventilate get ALI . ALI cause 75,000 death US year . Ventilators set work different way , call mode . One mode , call ARDSNet , pumps small amount air patient 's lung air release prior next breath . Another mode , call Airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) , keep air lung longer breath . Both mode currently use hospital . The investigator think APRV may help patient ALI , know sure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) represent spectrum clinical syndrome rapid respiratory system deterioration associate pulmonary systemic illness . These syndrome associate 30-40 % mortality current standard care responsible approximately 75,000 death US yearly . The current evidence-based care consist strategy mechanical ventilation utilize low lung volume ( ARDSNet ventilation ) intend limit lung injury overstretch lung induce ventilator . However , strategy show associate continued lung injury study still associate 30 % mortality rate . Airway pressure release ventilation ( APRV ) different , nonexperimental strategy mechanical ventilation currently routine clinical use . APRV allow patient great degree autonomy control his/her breathe achieve high mean airway pressure ( similar plateau pressure ) typically achieve ARDSNet . APRV associate less ventilator-associated pneumonia , good oxygenation , less sedative usage small study compare method ventilation . However , debate exists net effect APRV regard ventilator-associated lung injury . Additionally , recently complete study show APRV associate low ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) rate , benefit appear mediate sedation difference . We hypothesize VAP benefit might mediate great lung recruitment possibly less ventilator-induced lung injury APRV . We propose randomize , crossover study look biomarkers lung injury patient acute lung injury ventilate APRV ARDSNet . Our hypothesis airway pressure release ventilation associate low level lung injury biomarkers ARDSNet ventilation .</detailed_description>
