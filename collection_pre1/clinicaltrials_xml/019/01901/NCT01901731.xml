	<brief_title>Pelvic Embolisation Reduce Recurrent Varicose Veins - Primary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Varicose vein legs effect 20 40 % adult population UK . Approximately 100,000 operation perform per year varicose vein . Failure treat varicose vein result 10 20 % patient deteriorate skin damage leg ulceration . Recurrence rate follow surgery vary report 70 % 10 year . The common cause recurrence report : - neovascularisation ( new vessel growth treatment ) - miss vein initial operation - perforator vein incompetence - de novo reflux due normal deterioration age Recent study show leg varicose vein cause pelvic venous reflux pelvic venous reflux cause recurrent varicose vein . Previous publish work unit show approximately 20 % woman present varicose vein legs child previously pelvic venous reflux duplex ultrasound contribute venous reflux leg , cause varicose vein . Furthermore , recent retrospective study unit suggest failure treat pelvic venous reflux treat leg varicose vein major cause recurrent varicose vein quarter woman . However , despite circumstantial evidence , evidence prove whether treatment pelvic venous reflux confers advantage patient term reduction recurrence varicose vein future . The treatment pelvic venous reflux currently coil embolisation vein x-ray control . This procedure clearly additional cost treating leg . Therefore essential know whether treatment pelvic vein patient effect reduce recurrence leg varicose vein . To examine whether addition coil embolisation significant benefit patient , female patient present primary leg varicose vein duplex proven contribution pelvic venous reflux randomise : 1. transjugular coil embolisation pelvic vein follow endovenous treatment leg recurrent varicose vein 2. endovenous treatment leg recurrent varicose vein alone The impact demographic factor , severity patient 's symptom ( Aberdeen questionnaire , CEAP VCCS score ) treatment history explore addition type treatment receive . Patients follow six week , six month , one year , two year , three year , four year five year . Assessments quality-of-life scoring ( CIVIQ ) , symptom severity ( Aberdeen questionnaire , CEAP VCCS score ) , patient satisfaction clinical examination include clinical photograph , duplex ultrasonography . In presence recurrent varicose vein , source also classify use duplex ultrasonography .</detailed_description>
