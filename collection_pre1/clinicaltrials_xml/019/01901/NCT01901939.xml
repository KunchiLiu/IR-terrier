	<brief_summary>The propose preliminary study interdisciplinary team provide important information feasibility safety bedside low intensity pedal exercise hospitalization . The finding study essential develop high-value , effective treatment use hospital set throughout country . The program investigator propose may provide important change disability prevent elderly patient hospitalize acute illness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design include 2 phase ( 10 month ) development evaluation test intervention protocol . The last 4 month study devote preparation large randomize control clinical trial grant submission . Mixed method use phase . Phase I focus develop , test refine measurement protocol bedside tailor low intensity pedaling exercise ( Ex ) program use mixed method . During 10-month phase , researcher plan enroll 10 participant admit medical surgical ( MS ) unit meet study eligibility criterion . Investigators implement propose test intervention protocol , obtain feedback make modification necessary . For purpose study team use process improvement framework rapid cycle improvement . The outcome Phase I development manual operation test Ex protocol implement Phase II . Phase II ( 10 month ) randomly assign 60 patient age 65 year meet medical criterion admit medical surgical ( MS ) hospital unit VA Palo Alto Health care system ( VAPA HCS ) one two group , 1 ) low intensity bedside pedal exercise 2 ) usual care . All participant ask complete questionnaire , undergo Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , cognitive test blood draw prior participation Ex program ( baseline ) . All test blood draw repeat within 24 hour prior discharge ( release hospital home facility , indicate condition resolve adequately treat stabilized hospital stay ) hospital ( approximately 5-6 day ) . Participants follow duration hospital stay , expect average length 5-6 day . Additionally , participant ask continue exercise discharge home 4 week . All test perform baseline ( prior intervention ) , within 24 hour prior discharge ( release hospital home facility , indicate condition resolve adequately treat stabilized hospital stay ) hospital , average 5-6 day ) 4 week post discharge . The focus Phase II safety feasibility intervention association outcome measure . The length stay ( LOS ) VAPA HCS approximately 6 day . Thus , study investigator anticipate individual enrol approximately 5 day participate average 8 training session . Investigators also examine association physical activity level baseline ( pre Ex ) myokines associate change myokines intervention . A description Ex program : Individually tailor , low intensity bedside pedal exercise : Once participant complete test protocol instruct bedside Ex program . Exercise intensity duration individualize subject 's physical limitation tolerance . The PI Adult Nurse Practitioner ( ANP ) , supervise monitor exercise response include Heart Rate ( HR ) , Blood Pressure ( BP ) , Rating Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) , symptom ( intensity , duration ) . Exercise terminate accord American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) criterion . Ex consist progressively increase pedaling exercise perform initially one-two minute , three time daily tolerate . Pedaling exercise progressively increase tolerated appropriate . Cycle ergometry show effective exercise modality maintain muscle strength aerobic capacity variety age group . While inpatient exercise prescription utilize walk primary mode exercise , recent study show despite know benefit ambulation , multiple barrier prevent routine implementation practice setting . The study investigator propose examine feasibility portable bedside pedal device exercise . This modality eliminate dependence hospital staff supervise ambulation allow patient great access optimal treatment recommendation maintain functional independence . This exercise modality new , bedside use novel . The pedaling device sturdy portable place foot anchor chair . Subjects able pedal without fear fall interference device . This exercise perform addition normal ambulation requirement . All catheter device secure accidental removal occur Ex session . Adherence key component study monitor phase pilot study . Adherence assess direct observation PI/staff . Investigators also examine potential barrier facilitator exercise train adherence obtain qualitative feedback study participant . The qualitative information provide great depth understand improve delivery intervention well assist optimize adherence . The Study team also ask participant willing contact regard future research may interest .</detailed_description>
