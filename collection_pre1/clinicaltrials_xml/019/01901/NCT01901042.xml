	<brief_summary>Radiation proctitis quite common treatment pelvic tumor . We investigate whether use symbiotic would prevent early symptom radiation proctitis improve quality life patient undergoing radiotherapy prostate cancer treatment . We randomize patient intake one sachet either symbiotic product contain 4.3 g dietary fiber Lactobacillus reuteri concentration great 10 ( 8 ) colony form unit ( CFU ) ( Fibermais Flora Nestlé Brazil ) sachets contain 5 g maltodextrin . They instruct dilute one sachet 200mL water drink day week begin radiotherapy session , increase dose two sachet daily begin session four week . Every week questionnaire name EORTC QLQ-PRT23 apply evaluate GI symptom quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Symbiotic Reduction Acute Radiation Proctitis Symptoms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . The study include consecutively 20 patient refer treatment prostate cancer use three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-RCT ) . All patient agree participate sign informed consent form . The exclusion criterion use study : patient 's refusal participate research history surgery involve rectum inflammatory bowel disease Patients randomly assign receive sachet contain either symbiotic product powder form contain 4.3 g dietary fiber Lactobacillus reuteri concentration great 1.0 x 108 colony form unit ( CFU ) , five gram per sachet ( Fibermais Flora Nestlé Brazil ) ( symbiotic group ) maltodextrin ( 5g ) identical case identical aspect symbiotic group . All subject instruct dilute one sachet glass water drink day week begin radiotherapy session , increase dose two sachet daily begin session . EORTC QLQ-PRT23 questionnaire Each participant answer question EORTC QLQ-PRT23 questionnaire begin radiotherapy immediately first , second , third fourth week treatment . The question always ask examiner blind study design type treatment use . The EORTC QLQ-PRT23 questionnaire , originally develop English , translate Portuguese follow protocol describe EORTC Translation Procedure : The sum point obtain patient first 21 question EORTC QLQ-PRT23 record . All 21 question receive number point accord intensity symptom problem previous week , follow : - `` Not '' = 1 point ; `` A little '' = 2 point ; `` Quite bit '' = 3 point ; `` Very much '' = 4 point . Radiotherapy protocol A total dose 66-76 Gy 6-8 week program individual . Patients followed-up fourth week radiotherapy cumulative dose radiation compare weekly two group . Each patient schedule receive dose two gray ( Gy ) per day , Monday Friday weekend interval , total 10 Gy per week 40 Gy 4th week treatment . The irradiated rectal volume accumulate dose 40 Gy compare two group use dose-volume histogram present percentage rectal volume receive 10 Gy ( V10 ) , 20 Gy ( V20 ) , 30 Gy ( V30 ) , 40 Gy ( V40 ) . Outcome variables The endpoint study intensity gastrointestinal symptom quality life . All patient score sum question 1 21 represent gastrointestinal symptom quality life ; sum score obtain question number 1 15 , refer gastrointestinal symptom . Presence blood stool tenesmus intensity also assess accord score described use questionnaire . It also record maximum number evacuation patient period 24 hour week . Statistical analysis For calculation sample , estimate symbiotic group would present median four point low score placebo group four week . A total twenty patient ( 10 group ) calculate consider error alpha 1 % beta error 90 % . The Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Windows 9.0 used statistical analysis . A level 5 % ( p &lt; 0,05 ) establish significance . Fischer 's test chi-square test use categorical variable . For continuous data , use Mann-Whitney Student 's accord homogeneity ( Levene test ) normality ( Kolgomorov-Smirnov test ) data . Repeated measure ANOVA use analyze response obtain EORTC QLQ-PRT23 questionnaire .</detailed_description>
