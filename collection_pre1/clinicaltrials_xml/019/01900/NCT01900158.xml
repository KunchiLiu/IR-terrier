	<detailed_description>Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) uncommon adenocarcinoma arise neoplastic transformation cholangiocytes , epithelial cell line intra-hepatic extra-hepatic bile duct . CCA account 3 % digestive tumours 10-15 % hepatobiliary tumour . It annual incidence 1-2 case per 100,000 Western World , rate CCA steadily rise worldwide past several decade . On global scale , CCA second common primary hepatic malignancy These tumour poor overall survival 5-year survival 5 % . Over 50 % patient present advanced-stage disease , prognosis poor survival 6-12 month unresected patient , even biliary decompression . CCA may arise anywhere biliary tree , small , peripheral hepatic duct distal common bile duct . Commonly used classification system utilise anatomical location group tumours three main category : intra-hepatic ( 20-25 % ) , perihilar ( also know Klatskin tumour - 50 % ) distal ( 20-25 % ) . Hilar CCA adenocarcinoma extrahepatic biliary tree arise main leave right hepatic duct confluence . There grow recognition hilar CCA disease actually distinct biological behaviour natural history compare ( distal ) extra-hepatic CCA , increase acknowledgment different therapeutic strategy require ( 10 ) . At initial presentation patient extra-hepatic CCA , 30-50 % local lymph node involvement 10-20 % metastatic spread typically liver peritoneum . With hilar CCA due long asymptomatic course , 20 % resectable time diagnosis . Standard treatment option CCA include surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy , dependent upon CCA intra- extra-hepatic . Tumour resection potential cure CCA . Recent advance transplantation use stringent selection criterion utilization neoadjuvant chemoradiation demonstrate encouraging result 5 year survival rate 70 % , even one series The Mayo Clinic yield 5-year survival rate 82 % . For 80 % present unresectable disease , utility modality combine biliary decompression intervention provide median survival time 3-6 month time diagnosis . For patient inoperable locally advanced CCA main treatment aim palliative relieve local symptom pain jaundice . Surgery patient primarily create bypass patient stented . CCA remarkably resistant pharmacological therapy , activity see use chemotherapy ; mainly gemcitabine give either monotherapy pair either platin derivative fluoropyrimidine doublet treatment recently docetaxel , give partial response rate 0-9 % average survival advantage 2-12 month . Concerning biological therapy , ongoing study use sorafenib , lapatinib bevacizumab yield promising result , sorafenib demonstrate therapeutic benefit single arm PhII study . For patient unsuitable curative resection , current systemic combination chemotherapy cisplatin plus gemcitabine . This establish large randomize phase III study date non-operable biliary tract cancer demonstrate response rate 81.4 % median overall survival 11.7 month ; notably statistically significant increase toxicity compare gemcitabine monotherapy . The recent advance interventional endoscopic technology see rise highly specialized centre able deliver precise local control treatment aim gain local control ; include local ablation embolization , brachytherapy , radio-frequency ablation , significantly , photodynamic therapy , favourable adverse-event profile , recommend recent review article non-resectable patient .</detailed_description>
