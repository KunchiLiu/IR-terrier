	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine same-day HIV test antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) initiation improve retention care ( measure proportion participant alive in-care undetectable viral load 12 month HIV test ) , compare standard care ( three visit prior ART initiation ) . Secondary outcome include survival , ART initiation , retention care viral load &lt; 200 &lt; 1000 copies/ml , 6-month viral load , adherence measure self-report pharmacy refill record . Enrollment main study complete October 2015 . In June 2015 , enrollment start new sub-study . This sub-study , fund MAC AIDS , include patient WHO stage 1 2 disease CD4 count &gt; 500 cells/mm3 . The purpose sub-study compare 6-month retention patient receive same-day ART vs. standard pre-ART care . Secondary outcome include adherence INH Bactrim , cost-effectiveness two group .

	<detailed_description>This study randomize trial establish effectiveness same-day ART initiation patient present HIV test early HIV clinical disease ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] stage 1 2 ) qualify ART immunologic criterion ( CD4 cell count ≤500 cells/mm3 ) rapid CD4 cell test GHESKIO Center Port-au-Prince , Haiti . All patient intervention group receive rapid HIV antibody test , CD4 cell test , clinically relevant test opportunistic infection , WHO stag , comprehensive counsel social support , ART initiation day presentation . The standard group receive service same-day ART group ( include CD4 cell test ) except instead same-day ART , receive standard GHESKIO protocol three sequential visit ART readiness counsel test opportunistic infection prior ART initiation . For same-day ART group , activity take place day ART initiation subsequent two week . Three specific aim propose . The first aim compare proportion patient standard same-day ART group alive in-care undetectable HIV viral load 12 month HIV test . The second aim compare six-month ART adherence two group use pharmacy refill record . The third aim compare cost cost-effectiveness standard same-day ART , cost measure mean treatment cost effectiveness measure alive care undetectable viral load 12 month HIV test . In sub-study funded MAC AIDS Foundation ( enrollment start June 2015 ) , patient WHO stage 1 2 disease CD4 count &gt; 500 cells/mm3 include . They randomize receive ART vs. standard pre-ART care . Participants enrol study day receive CD4 count result , within 7 day date HIV testing . All patient receive additional test clinically indicate . All participant receive prophylactic treatment trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole isoniazid , daily multivitamin , standard care GHESKIO . Participants randomized standard pre-ART group receive standard GHESKIO pre-ART care , include monthly visit physician 3 month , every month physician visit . They CD4 count annually , start ART meet WHO criterion . Participants randomize same-day ART group receive counsel start ART day study enrollment . They follow-up visit physician Days 3 , 10 , 17 , 24 , social worker Days 3 , 10 , 17 . They also physician visit week 8 12 . Participants clinically stable , asymptomatic , adherent week 12 qualify expedite care future visit , include dispense ART directly nurse clinic every four week , reduce wait time patient . Participants symptomatic non-adherent referred physician evaluation .</detailed_description>
