	<brief_title>Does Prescriptive Treatment Hips Improve Outcomes Patients With Low Back Pain ? A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It suggest treatment hip improve outcome patient mechanical low back pain . This yet study randomize controlled fashion conservative venue . For study , two group patient low back pain ( randomization ) . For inclusion randomize clinical trial , patient need 18 year age old mechanically producible LBP . They require minimum Modified Oswestry Disability Index score 20 % baseline pain score &gt; 2.0/10 numeric analog scale pain , within session change ( improvement visit ) pain and/or range motion assessment phase clinical examination . This finding advocate effective mechanism determine patient candidate manual therapy . Exclusion criterion include presence red flag ( i.e. , tumor , metabolic disease , rheumatoid arthritis , osteoporosis , prolonged history steroid use , etc . ) , sign consistent nerve root compression ( reproduction low back leg pain straight leg raise le 45Â° , muscle weakness involve major muscle group lower extremity , diminish low extremity muscle stretch reflex , diminish absent sensation pinprick low extremity dermatome ) . Other exclusion criterion include prior surgery lumbar spine current pregnancy . Both group receive pragmatic treatment approach physical therapist low back pain . One group also receive prescriptive treatment approach hip . The investigator track outcome disability ( Oswestry ) , Pain ( Numeric pain rating scale ) , recovery baseline , 2 week , discharge . Our aim determine difference group exist , primary outcome measure ODI . The investigator feel additional standardized exercise program stretch hip improve outcome patient mechanical low back pain .</detailed_description>
