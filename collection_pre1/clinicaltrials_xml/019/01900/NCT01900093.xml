	<brief_summary>Although ACTHAR gel approve treatment acute relapse , currently widely use . Thus , propose conduct small open-label proof-of-concept trial evaluate response ACTHAR gel therapy patient fail make satisfactory recovery treatment high dose IVMP . Documentation clinical course well adverse event related IVMP use make . The investigator propose study potential benefit 14-day course ( dose historically use since landmark clinical trial Rose et al1 ) subcutaneous ACTHAR gel 10 patient demonstrated inadequate improvement course IVMP , 1000 mg daily , 5 treatment ( maximum 8 day ) . These would patient PLEX would consider treatment possibility . The primary outcome measure improvement target neurological deficit , measure appropriate functional system score ( FSS ) EDSS .</brief_summary>
