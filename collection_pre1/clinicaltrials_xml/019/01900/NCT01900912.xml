	<brief_summary>Behavioral change key ingredient successful adoption well sanitation practice rural Africa . Sanitation program , time , incorporate need raise awareness emphasize benefit toilet usage . These endeavor , often combine subsidy link toilet construction household , seek create demand sanitation good . Yet , progress securing desire outcome sanitation program slow . Moreover , benefit sanitation largely take form externality , individual take account making decision investment . This make sanitation promotion household level particularly challenge . A new approach sanitation entail shift away provision subsidy toilets individual household promotion behavioral change individual-level towards emphasize collective decision-making order produce 'open defecation-free ' village . The objective intervention reduce incidence disease related poor sanitation manage public risk pose failure safely confine excreta community member . The way achieve objective empower community motivate take collective action . Local government agency perform facilitating role . There grow recognition approach , refer Community-Led Total Sanitation ( CLTS ) , may help reduction open defecation practice . However , rigorous impact evaluation CLTS conduct far . This randomize control trial study effect CLTS rural Mali . As result , sound evidence become available see extent CLTS improve health outcome drive collective action order increase sanitation coverage . The direct recipient intervention member rural community Mali aspire live cleaner environment . The donor community , international organization , government develop country benefit simple clear evidence effectiveness innovative program improve sanitation rural area . They learn whether program work fail achieve objective eradicate open defecation , key factor explain success failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Impact Community Led Total Sanitation Programs Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evaluation study describe involve 121 community Region Koulikoro rural Mali . The intervention work follow manner : community facilitate ( means government NGOs staff ) conduct appraisal analysis open defecation ( OD ) take action become open defecation free ( ODF ) . In Mali , Open Defecation Free ( ODF ) status define follow : `` family latrine equip cover limit proliferation fly pit ; member family exclusively use latrine defecate ; latrine equip hand wash device ( water + soap / water + ash bucket ) '' . To estimate causal effect CLTS researcher need construct valid counterfactual order calculate would happen absence intervention . Random allocation ensure average , treated untreated community share observables unobservables . Random assignment treatment also overcome main selection problem find evaluation , select receive program may different attribute select first place . These difference cause observable attribute , wealthy community , engage leader , good weather , etc , may willing engage CLTS program , unobservable dimension . What important difference affect outcome investigator want measure . Random assignment program eliminate selection bias ensure average , communities receive program similar one receive . Although random assignment community level , basic unit analysis evaluation household . The investigator interested health outcome child five , diarrhea among main cause child mortality . Also , researcher interest look morbidity school attendance school age child . Finally , improve sanitation suppose produce redistribution use time household level . In addition researcher interested look variable directly relate success/failure intervention . In particular , investigator monitor latrine use , water quality , general hygiene . The team able determine whether lack impact health outcome due lack latrine use despite availability , whether due lack hand hygiene despite use latrine . UNICEF observe area program already implement migration relatively low , researcher expect much attrition . This decrease diarrhea expect even village become fully ODF , take level low . The evaluation comprise gather data two point time : ) baseline , program implementation , b ) follow 12 month program implementation order ass longer-term effect sustainability . The investigator would able gather panel data community household level . While random assignment allow compare average outcome across community , investigator would also perform multivariate regression analysis order improve precision estimate control potential pre-treatment difference . Panel data allows use difference difference design , necessary , also include initial ( intervention ) characteristic households community . Standard error cluster community level . The community include study understand agree part study , mean accept work sanitation issue CLTS either right away two year later . Randomization complete baseline conduct . UNICEF Directorate Sanitation Koulikoro ( DNACPN ) conduct trigger process 60 community assign treatment group . One main concern random assignment potential contamination control group . This happen example interaction member CLTS communities member control community . This problem presence share activity . The problem interaction may cause change control group . At extreme , control community CLTS community experience change , researcher able detect effect . The researcher ensure study community geographic buffer , interaction expect high . In order check interaction family member live different community , team add several question survey document extent interaction . Another concern often arise randomized experiment control unit may receive similar benefit intervention . The investigator monitor control village ensure happen document aspect design . UNICEF plan conduct strict monitoring intervention period ( first 3 month ) . The research team plan supplement work measure relevant indicator intervention compliance intervention period end intervention . The investigator give careful attention variation impact across different group , treatment may interact gender age indicator , pre-existing characteristic community term collective decision-making , among others order identify factor may explain people community gain others program . Looking heterogeneity program impact also help shed light mechanism behind program 's success ( failure ) . This one first evaluation use impact evaluation technique quantitative data [ random assignment ] CLTS program develop world . It also complement already exist evidence . Another advantage evaluation look carefully behavioral outcome behind adoption well sanitation practice often overlook evaluation related sanitation , tend focus health outcome . It widely accept good sanitation improve health , yet still much debate cost-effective way deliver sanitation intervention may . Success delivery much depend whether program able identify bottleneck impede adoption good sanitation practice whether able solve issue identify .</detailed_description>
