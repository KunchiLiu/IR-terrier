	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Multiple Doses ITI-214 Healthy Adults Adults With Stable Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call ITI-214 . This study look well different dos ITI-214 tolerate healthy people people stable schizophrenia . In addition , exploratory neuroimaging conduct participant schizophrenia . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The study comprise 2 part : Multiple-Rising Dose ( MRD ) Neuroimaging ( NI ) . Approximately 40 healthy participant plan enrol MRD part study approximately 36 patient stable schizophrenia plan enrol Neuroimaging part study . Participants MRD ( parallel design ) part enrol cohort different dose level . In dose cohort , participant randomly assign active dose placebo—which remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) . The follow dose cohort enrol : Doses A , B , C , D. Participants ask take study drug oral solution daily total 14 day confine study site . Participants contact telephone 22 44 day last dose study drug follow-up assessment . Participants Neuroimaging ( NI ) part study randomly assign one six treatment sequence . Each sequence consist 3 cross-over treatment period . The following dos test : Doses E , F , G , H. Each participant undergo 3 treatment period placebo ITI-214 daily dose 7 day period . There washout period minimum 7 day treatment period . Participants confine study site 5 day treatment period report site dose day study drug administration . There follow-up assessment Days 14 37 Period 3 . Study terminate due business decision . The study compound transfer Intra-Cellular Therapies , Inc .</detailed_description>
