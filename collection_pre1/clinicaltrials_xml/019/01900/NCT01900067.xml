	<brief_summary>The investigation design Open-Label , Multicenter , Randomised , Controlled Investigation Evaluate Efficacy Safety BARRIERÂ® EasyWarm Active Self-Warming Blanket Used Continuous Active Warming Prevent General Anaesthesia Induced Hypothermia During Perioperative Surgical Period . Null hypothesis ( H0 ) : There difference two study population ( interventional treatment group versus control treatment group ) regard average core body temperature measurement perioperative phase.Alternative hypothesis ( H1 ) : The average core body temperature measurement perioperative phase significantly higher interventional group compare control group .</brief_summary>
