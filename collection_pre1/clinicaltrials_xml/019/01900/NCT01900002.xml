	<brief_title>Sorafenib Yttrium-90 Glass Microspheres Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TheraSphere medical device radioactive material call yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) . When Y-90 put microscopic glass bead call microspheres , injected artery directly liver . This allow large dose radiation deliver directly tumor , lower risk side effect radiation part body healthy liver tissue . The radiation TheraSphere stay body begin lose energy break within 12 day . The glass microspheres break stay body point . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . If find eligible take part study , start take sorafenib 2 time day start Day 1 Cycle 1 , 4 week start TheraSphere treatment . You need take sorafenib tablet 12 hour apart , time morning evening . The sorafenib tablet take without food , least 1 hour 2 hour meal , 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . While take sorafenib , avoid grapefruit , Seville ( sour ) orange , star fruit , pomegranate , product contain juice fruit . TheraSphere Treatment : After 4 week take sorafenib ( +/- 1 week ) , TheraSphere treatment perform . The procedure take 1½ 3 hour complete . After start sorafenib treatment , angiogram schedule occur least 2 week TheraSphere treatment . The angiogram image test use radiologic contrast dye allow doctor view body 's blood vessel artery . It take 1½ 3 hour complete . You give drug vein arm hand help relax , awake procedure . During procedure , area groin numb local anesthetic doctor insert catheter ( sterile plastic tube ) blood vessel groin lead blood flow liver . The contrast dye inject catheter series X-rays take allow doctor see blood vessel liver . At end procedure , catheter remove . The X-rays use doctor plan TheraSphere treatment . You require sign separate consent form angiogram explain procedure associate risk detail . You also albumin scan , part angiogram . Imaging sphere similar size TheraSphere microspheres inject liver test well TheraSphere microspheres may stay liver travel organ . During TheraSphere treatment , give drug IV arm hand help relax , stay awake procedure . An area groin numb local anesthetic . The doctor insert catheter blood vessel groin lead blood flow liver . Based planning result angiogram procedure , doctor guide catheter target blood vessel . Once doctor think catheter proper blood vessel , TheraSphere microspheres contain Y-90 injected catheter block blood supply blood vessel inject microspheres fill Y-90 tumor liver . After TheraSphere microspheres inject , catheter remove groin . After TheraSphere treatment procedure , stay Interventional Radiology recovery area several hour staff monitor possible side effect . If experience serious side effect complication receive TheraSphere treatment study doctor think best interest , may admit hospital monitor additional treatment . Study Visits : If receive warfarin , blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) collect every week check blood 's ability clot . If doctor think best interest , may switch enoxaparin instead warfarin . On Day 1 Cycle 2 every cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check blood 's ability clot , liver function test , measure level alpha-feto protein . At end every 2 Cycles ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 ) : - Urine collect routine testing measure general protein level . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . Length Treatment : The TheraSphere treatment perform one time . You may continue take sorafenib long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up phone call . End-of-Treatment Visit : After complete TheraSphere treatment take last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . The urine sample also use measure general protein level . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check blood 's ability clot , liver function test , measure level alpha-feto protein . - You CT MRI scan check status disease . Follow-Up Phone Calls : After complete End-of-Treatment visit , study staff contact phone every 3 month learn since treatment end . During phone call , ask started additional anti-tumor anti-cancer therapy , name anti-cancer drug ( ) may take . You also ask side effect may still experience . Each follow-up phone call last 15-30 minute . If standard care visit around time phone call schedule , may ask question person clinic . This investigational study . Sorafenib commercially available FDA approve treat advance liver cancer . TheraSphere commercially available FDA approve use radiation treatment neoadjuvant therapy surgery and/or transplantation treatment hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
