	<brief_summary>Background : - This research do describe type bacteria find mouths patient severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) treat drug suppress immune system stem cell transplant . People SAA receive treatment likely get infection . Studies show might link bacteria mouth bacteria cause infection . The bacteria find mouths patient SAA describe . Objectives : - To understand change mouth bacteria relate treatment describe oral bacterial environment . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year age go treated SAA . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants answer question medical history dental care . Their mouth examine . - Participants SAA test treatment disease , course 1 year . All participant SAA test 3 scheduled appointment . Any participant require breathe tube receive additional test . - Healthy volunteer test 1 visit . - Participants give two sample time . A saliva sample take disposable padded tool . Skin cell collect tongue small plastic brush .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Description Bacteria Mouths Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mouth complex biological ecosystem normally contain 700 different specie bacteria . Some bacteria live exopolysacchride matrix biofilm occupy specific niche complex oral environment . Understanding oral environment microbiota inhabit assist determine impact health disease . There several study critically ill patient demonstrate change oral bacteria relate acute illness . Identification respiratory pathogen mouth lead researcher hypothesize relationship exist oral cavity pulmonary infection . Identification potential pathogen oral cavity patient severe aplastic anemia could indicate similar association oral pathogen infection patient develop respiratory infection severe enough require intubation . This descriptive case-control study characterize oral microbiota patient severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) . Patients follow 1 year treatment development respiratory symptom require intubation ( case ) . The case compare two group control , namely SAA patient require intubation receive treatment SAA normal healthy volunteer age gender match . A difference oral microbiome identify specimen collect treatment patient require intubation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult patient schedule receive treatment SAA screen protocol . These patient recruit numerous protocol actively accept new research participant Clinical Center , NIH . INCLUSION CRITERIA Any adult patient ( great equal to18 year age ) , diagnose SAA . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Any SAA patient find significant tooth loss decay edentulous exclude . This exclusion criterion assess PI representative prior sign inform consent .</criteria>
