	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To compare impact switch efavirenz ( EFV ) plus two nucleoside analog rategravir ( RAL ) plus two nucleoside analog versus keep antiretroviral regimen hepatic steatosis ( HS ) measure control attenuation parameter ( CAP ) among HIV/HCV-coinfected patient . Secondary Trial Objective : 1 . To compare proportion HIV/HCV-coinfected patient one category decrease grade HS patient continue EFV plus two nucleoside analog switch EFV plus two nucleoside analog RAL plus two nucleoside analog . 2 . To evaluate proportion patient maintain viral control ( HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL ) switching . Design : Open-label , randomized clinical trial evaluate safety ( phase IV ) Condition : HIV HCV coinfection . Intervention : Patients current EFV plus two nucleoside analog randomly assign switch EFV RAL ( 400mg BID ) , maintain nucleoside analog unchanged , continue current regimen .</brief_summary>
