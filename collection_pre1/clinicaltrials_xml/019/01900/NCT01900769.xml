	<brief_summary>Although blood volume important parameter everyday clinical medicine measure easily . As matter fact , almost never measure estimate calculate base upon number derive mostly healthy patient . The investigator even know whether someone 's normal - i.e . surgery - blood volume actually anywhere close generally accept estimate calculation . Tests exist substance know concentration dilute person 's blood volume result concentration measure , allow blood volume calculate . However , none test complete bedside since fast require considerable set-up . This study turn approach upside-down : dilute blood slightly know small volume intravenous fluid commonly use many clinical setting measure concentra-tion hemoglobin - oxygen carrier contain red blood cell - add fluid . That allow similar calculation without use neither specialized substance equipment . Hemoglobin routinely measure laboratory often routine test surg-eries intensive care unit . Devices measure hemoglobin skin without actually draw blood avail-able . If find comparable laboratory determination hemoglobin could provide bedside almost real-time assessment blood volume , something could extremely valuable de-cision make critical area medicine promote goal direct therapy .</brief_summary>
