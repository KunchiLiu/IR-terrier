	<brief_summary>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often limited exercise capacity intolerable shortness breath ( dyspnea ) . Patients breathe high lung volume exercise force inspiratory muscle work high percentage maximal capacity . This increase inspiratory effort show independently relate symptom dyspnea exercise previous research . Eight week high intensity variable flow resistive inspiratory muscle train hypothesize reduce inspiratory effort decrease neural drive inspiratory muscle . These factor hypothesize jointly contribute delay occurrence intolerable symptom dyspnea improve exercise tolerance patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Inspiratory Muscle Training Dyspnea Perception During Exercise Patients With COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We want study whether highly intense inspiratory muscle train program improves exercise capacity reduce inspiratory effort , improve pulmonary mechanic delay development intolerable symptom dyspnea cycle exercise . Eight week high intensity variable flow resistive inspiratory muscle train hypothesize reduce inspiratory effort decrease neural drive inspiratory muscle . The ratio inspiratory effort volume displacement improve , reduction inspiratory capacity exercise delay . These factor hypothesize jointly contribute delay occurrence intolerable symptom dyspnea improve exercise tolerance patient . We study physiological mechanism inspiratory muscle training exerts effect dyspnea reduction exercise capacity . In clinical trial patient randomly allocate either intervention control group . The intervention group receive highly intense inspiratory muscle train program improve inspiratory muscle function . The control group receive sham training result physiological benefit . During 8-week training period patient attend hospital weekly short visit perform training session supervision . Before train intervention patient assessed twice 8-week program . This mean trial involve total 11 visit ( 3 long visit ( approximately 4h ) assessment 8 short visit ( approximately 30 minute ) supervise training session ) period 2-3 month . Assessments pulmonary function , inspiratory muscle function , exercise capacity , daily physical activity symptom dyspnea exercise perform . Pulmonary mechanic inspiratory muscle activation exercise also assess . Stable COPD patient pronounce inspiratory muscle weakness ( Pi , max &lt; 70cmH2O &lt; 70 % predict ) eligible participate study . Exclusion criterion diagnose psychiatric cognitive disorder , progressive neurological neuromuscular disorder severe orthopedic problem major impact exercise capacity . Patients intervention placebo group follow eight-week IMT program . They receive either high intensity IMT ( intervention group ) sham IMT ( placebo group ) . Interventions present patient strength training ( intervention group ) endurance training ( placebo group ) . Measurements primary secondary endpoint perform 8 week IMT . All test perform experienced investigator blind group allocation . Total training load group two three daily session 30 breath ( 3-4 minute per session ) , 7 day per week , 8 week . IMT perform use variable flow resistive load device ( POWERbreatheÂ®KH1 , HaB International Ltd. , Southam , UK ) . Differences primary secondary outcome group 8 week IMT compare adjust baseline difference analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . Dyspnea perception 10-point Borg Scale ( BORG CR10 ) identical ventilation constant work rate cycle test intervention primary outcome . To detect difference one point dyspnea perception 10-point Borg Scale identical ventilation constant work rate cycle test intervention subject , assume standard deviation change dyspnea perception baseline follow-up measurement 1 point degree certainty ( statistical power ) 80 % risk type I error ( ) &lt; 5 % , sample size 16 patient group need . These estimate base previous work dyspnea perception exercise .</detailed_description>
