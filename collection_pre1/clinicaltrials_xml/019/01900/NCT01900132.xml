	<brief_summary>Background : - Electrical impedance myography ( EIM ) new technique study see helpful evaluate muscle disorder nerve disorder . EIM look mild , painless electrical current travel muscle . Researchers want gain experience use EIM device . They collect information result use people without nerve muscle disease , compare information standard test . First , test device healthy people . Then test people variety neuromuscular disease . Because test noninvasive painful , researcher test child adult . Objectives : - To gain experience use EIM muscle test device . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 2 year old . - Individuals least 2 year old neuromuscular disease . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants one 2 3 hour clinic visit . Researchers may request follow-up visit . - Participants test EIM device . The device small electrode place skin . An electric current pas device , participant feel . - Participants may ultrasound test . A gel put skin , device move skin . - Participants may nerve test . Electrodes place skin , feel small shock . - Participants may test thin needle inserted muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This observational exploratory protocol use electrical impedance myography ( EIM ) device study neuromuscular disorder . The aim gain proficiency use EIM device initially healthy volunteer try correlate use modality muscle ultrasound electrodiagnostic technique . We extend investigation subject variety neuromuscular disease . Study : 125 healthy volunteer 125 subject neuromuscular disease . The subject adults child , healthy volunteer subject neuromuscular disease . Initially , evaluate EIM healthy volunteer . Since advantage EIM noninvasive nonpainful , evaluate pediatric population . Design : The study perform outpatient clinic . For healthy volunteer evaluate EIM along possible ultrasound electrodiagnostic method . A single session 3hours le . Repeat study may perform establish reproducibility initial study complete . For subject neuromuscular disease , study conduct single outpatient session 3 hour less , unless follow-up study request primary team . For child , session 2 hour less . Outcome measure : This exploratory protocol use EIM device . We aim develop lab normative value EIM use healthy volunteer . For subject neuromuscular disease aim understand value EIM type biomarker different neuromuscular disorder . Eventually , would like incorporate EIM clinical trial biomarker though within scope current protocol . As secondary outcome measure , explore correlation EIM ultrasound electrodiagnostic method .</detailed_description>
