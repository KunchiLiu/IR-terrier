	<brief_summary>This international ( France , Austria Germany ) , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase II study evaluate efficacy safety regorafenib patient histologically proven metastatic and/or unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma ( STS ) failure intolerance doxorubicin ( anthracycline ) . Five cohort define : Cohort A : Liposarcoma Cohort B : Leiomyosarcoma Cohort C : Synovial sarcoma Cohort D : sarcoma ( see Appendix C ) Cohort E : Leiomyosarcoma , Synovial sarcoma sarcoma list Appendix C previously treat pazopanib Approximately 226 patient meet eligibility criterion randomly assign 1:1 ratio one treatment group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Regorafenib Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard care metastatic soft tissue sarcoma doxorubicin +/- ifosfamide . After failure intolerance doxorubicin , standard care . In Europe , two currently approve treatment soft tissue sarcoma failure/intolerance doxorubicin : trabectedin ( Yondelis® ) histological subtype pazopanib ( Votrient ® ) subtypes exclude liposarcoma . Nevertheless , none drug improve overall survival placebo . The study compose 3 period : 1 . A Screening Period , 2 . A Treatment Period , 3 . And Survival Follow-up Period . Patients randomize treated regorafenib receive treatment orally 3 week every 4 week ( 28 day ) cycle ( ie , 3 week on/1 week ) . Patients randomize placebo arm treat 3 week every 4 week cycle ( ie , 3 week on/1 week ) . In addition regorafenib placebo treatment , patient receive best supportive care . Best supportive care include method preserve comfort dignity patient exclude disease-specific anti-neoplastic therapy kinase inhibitor , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgical intervention . Patients receive placebo , experience disease progression may offer open-label regorafenib ( cross-over option ) .</detailed_description>
