	<detailed_description>Adipose tissue ( fat ) inflammation emerge important harbinger disease development include Type 2 diabetes , heart disease potentially cancer . The hallmark feature adipose tissue inflammation crown-like structure , die fat cell surround immune cell attempt clear damage . Current method detect adipose tissue inflammation rely invasive procedure fat biopsy . We propose develop method use light reflection property inflame adipose tissue potential non-invasive method detect adipose tissue inflammation .</detailed_description>
