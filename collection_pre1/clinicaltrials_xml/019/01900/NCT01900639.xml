	<brief_summary>Low-dose aspirin cornerstone secondary prevention cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) usually take awakening , although evidence regard optimal time intake lacking . Platelet reactivity follow circadian rhythm , peak morning , contribute morning peak cardiovascular disease . Due short half life , aspirin inhibits platelet present time intake . Thus , time aspirin intake may influence inhibitory effect platelet intake aspirin bedtime may attenuate morning peak platelet reactivity . The time-dependent effect aspirin circadian rhythm platelet function never study . We hypothesize aspirin intake bedtime compare intake awaken result reduction morning peak platelet reactivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin AM PM : Effect Circadian Rhythm Platelet Reactivity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular event lead cause mortality morbidity western country . In European Union , 47 % total mortality cause cardiovascular disease2 . Aspirin cornerstone secondary prevention cardiovascular disease inhibitory effect platelet aggregation . It reduce risk recurrent cardiovascular event quarter3 . Although supported evidence , aspirin usually take morning , may beneficial take aspirin bedtime instead awaken . It convincingly show platelet activity follow circadian rhythm , peak platelet reactivity morning4-8 . This might part explain increase cardiovascular event early morning , high incidence 6 12 AM1 . Since platelet reactivity follow circadian rhythm , time aspirin intake may influence inhibitory effect platelet . Due short half-life , aspirin inhibits platelet present time intake . New platelet release rate 10 % /day , predominantly night9 . Because reactive inhibited aspirin take precede morning , young platelet contribute morning peak platelet reactivity10 , 11 . It argue intake aspirin bedtime could better prevent early morning increase platelet reactivity intake awakening , assume intake awaken would late prevent morning peak platelet reactivity12 . Additionally , recent study show significant recovery platelet aggregation 24 hour patient use low-dose aspirin daily basis13 . This support hypothesis aspirin intake bedtime could beneficial reduce morning peak platelet reactivity , thereby possibly also reduce incidence arterial thrombotic event morning . However , never study .</detailed_description>
