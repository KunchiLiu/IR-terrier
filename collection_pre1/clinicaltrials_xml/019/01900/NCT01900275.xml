	<brief_summary>Across world , common cause die ICU disease call `` sepsis '' . Sepsis disease body 's protective response infection become intense , unnecessarily damage important organ body . Kidney damage sepsis particularly bad , person 's chance survival drop significantly develop kidney failure . This study plan learn detect ( thus prevent ) kidney failure early sepsis . The current test doctor use detect kidney failure 's already happen . We must therefore find good way detect kidney failure earlier , still chance protect kidney . In study , patient provide one-time sample urine . We check urine sign protein call `` heparanase '' , believe important early kidney failure . We see high heparanase activity urine predicts risk develop kidney failure . We compare result patient sepsis result patient trauma , allow u determine heparanase important sepsis kidney failure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Septic shock major trauma . Septic shock define standard criterion include ( ) presence systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , ( b ) evidence infection , ( c ) treatment vasopressor medication &gt; 4 hour despite &gt; 30 ml/kg intravenous crystalloid resuscitation . As criticallyill comparator group , also enroll adult patient admit ( within 24 hour prior screen ) Denver Health Surgical ICU major trauma , define Injury Severity Score &gt; 15 . Exclusion criterion include anuria , prisoner , absence routinelyinserted urine collection device , gross hematuria . Additionally , patient know genitourinary malignancy exclude , give cancer know overexpress heparanase . Additional exclusion criterion include age &lt; 18 year , pregnant woman .</criteria>
