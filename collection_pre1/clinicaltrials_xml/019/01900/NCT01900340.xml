	<brief_title>Intestinal Glucagon-like Peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) Physiological Role Eating Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding exact mechanisms GLP-1 inhibits eat crucial order convert anorectic action useful , safe effective drug . So far , however clear extent GLP-1 hormonal regulator eat whether observed effect rather pharmacological phenomenon . By apply classical algorithm endocrinology several criterion must fulfil hormone consider endogenous physiological satiety signal . One exogenous administration selective antagonist prevent eating-inhibitory effect GLP-1 . At present , cholecystokinin ( CCK ) peptide human identify fit criterion . For intestinal GLP-1 , investigate whether specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist block eating-inhibitory effect human . The availability specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist , exendin ( 9-39 ) , make possible investigate pathway . Exendin ( 9-39 ) , powerful tool available human use characterize endogenous GLP-1 physiological regulator different biological function . The molecule use document endogenous GLP-1 important incretin hormone regulator antro-pyloro-duodenal motility . The role endogenous GLP-1 regulating food intake appetite , however , investigate .</detailed_description>
