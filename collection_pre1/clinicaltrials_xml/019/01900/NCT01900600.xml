	<brief_summary>The propose study sub-study CANTOS trial ( A randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , event driven trial quarterly subcutaneous canakinumab prevention recurrent cardiovascular event among stable post-myocardial infarction patient elevate high sensitivity C-reaction protein ( hsCRP ) [ CACZ885M2301 ] ) . The study propose perform serial Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests ( CPX ) prospectively measure change aerobic exercise capacity patient prior myocardial infarction ( MI ) , elevate C reactive protein plasma level , symptomatic heart failure reduce systolic function , enrol main CANTOS trial randomly assign Canakinumab ( 3 different dos ) Placebo . The subject enrol substudy undergo repeat CPX echocardiogram first 12 month CANTOS trial . The subject receive experimental treatment randomize main CANTOS trial receive additional experimental treatment part sub-study . This study Investigator-initiated ( Dr. Abbate ) single-center ( Virginia Commonwealth University ) sub-study CANTOS trial , support Novartis pharmaceutical .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients enrol CANTOS trial ( prior acute myocardial infarction [ &gt; 30 day ] elevate C reactive protein level [ CRP &gt; 2mg/l ] ) also reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF &lt; 50 % ) symptomatic heart failure ( New York Heart Association symptoms class II-III ) offer take part sub-study Virginia Commonwealth University site . As part sub-study , patient undergo cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPX ) baseline prior initiation treatment , repeat 3 12 month , transthoracic echocardiogram baseline 12 month .</detailed_description>
