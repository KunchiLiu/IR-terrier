	<detailed_description>Myocardial ischemia reduction coronary blood flow insufficient heart cell ( myocardiocyte ) demand . Prolonged ischemia result myocardiocyte injury , death necrosis i.e. , myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Cardiovascular disease result myocardial ischemia major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) spectrum clinical presentation acute myocardial ischemia range ST-elevation MI ( STEMI ) non-STEMI ( NSTEMI ) unstable angina ( UA ) . Because ACS portend high-risk death , treatment time sensitive delay diagnosis definitive care may decrease survival . However , treatment-associated risk bleeding , stroke death also necessitate accurate diagnosis ACS . Chest pain common symptom ACS main cause emergency department ( ED ) visit middle-aged second common present complaint age group account 500,000 ED visit Canada 5 million United States America ( USA ) year . In 2005 , number ED visit chest pain increase 20 % previous decade , median age western world 's population increase next decade , EDs ass chest pain patient ACS ever . Because chest pain common presenting complaint symptom many non-ACS condition , diagnosis ACS challenging . STEMI diagnose specific electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding whereas NSTEMI UA clinically indistinguishable similarity symptom transient non-specific ECG finding presentation . Differentiation NSTEMI less severe UA base whether ischemic myocardial injury severe enough release detectable concentration myocardiocyte-specific protein , cardiac troponin ( cTn ) . Therefore , patient ACS symptoms non-diagnostic ECG diagnose NSTEMI troponin level cutoff concentration similar patient troponin level cutoff diagnose UA admit treatment . However , patient atypical symptom cTn concentration cutoff represent clinical dilemma usually discharge ED without treatment understand risk ACS-related event within next day , week month . Within next year , many Canadian laboratory replace current cTn test new high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay ( hs-cTn ) analytically sensitive precise low concentration . This change could significant impact EDs healthcare system general . First foremost , application current cutoff definition NSTEMI new hs-cTn assay produce increase prevalence NSTEMI may may true increase . This result patient admit hospital give high-risk therapy unknown overall change morbidity mortality . Second , recent evidence suggest new assay help diagnose MI early incremental hs-cTn measurement potentially prognostic future cardiovascular event ( CVE ) include death . Therefore , inevitable change assay potential stress current healthcare resource significantly improve ACS diagnosis subsequent outcomes . The primary barrier achieve optimum clinical benefit implementation hs-cTn current lack information . Specifically , study hs-cTn assay cutoff early MI diagnosis North American population limit publish research hs-cTn assay risk stratification ED non-existent . The investigator primary objective determine hs-cTn concentration ( ) predictive composite outcome CVE time ED patient present ACS symptom . In population , investigator also determine early change cTn hs-cTn concentration predictive peak cTn hs-cTn concentration composite outcome time . The investigator intention physician able apply prognostic cTn hs-cTn cutoff study result prescribe time-appropriate intervention patient . The expected effect generalize application investigator result positive change patient safety , survival , secondary ACS prevention even ED overcrowding .</detailed_description>
