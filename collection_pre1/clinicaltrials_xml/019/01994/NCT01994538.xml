	<brief_summary>This study investigate treatment urinary tract infection men . Specifically , investigator look see short duration antibiotic ( 7 day ) bad long duration antibiotic ( 14 day ) . The investigator also study whether long treatment lead increase antibiotic resistant bacteria large intestine ( colon ) , increase drug side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seven vs. 14 Days Treatment Male Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study randomize placebo-controlled trial treatment duration male urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . Specifically , 319 men UTI randomize 7 vs. 14 day antimicrobial treatment . The primary outcome resolution UTI symptom , assess 14 day complete active antimicrobial treatment . Secondary outcome include recurrent UTI 4 week treatment , adverse drug event , intestinal carriage antimicrobial resistant Gram-negative bacillus . Subjects enrol Primary Care Clinic Emergency Department Minneapolis VA Medical Center ( MVAMC ) . Currently , optimal treatment duration male UTI unknown . A clinical trial 14 vs. 28 day treatment show difference outcome , whereas another trial 3 vs.14 day show increase recurrence 3 day treatment . However , current treatment recommendation treat men UTI 7 14 day , data exist favor shorter long duration . Most men UTI VA treat 7 day , associate small significant increase Clostridium difficile infection . Additionally , study non-UTI infectious disease show longer-duration treatment lead increase antimicrobial resistance . Longer-duration treatment also costly inconvenient patient . Thus , since longer-duration treatment associate adverse outcome , order justify longer-duration treatment thee must clinically significant benefit extend treatment . Accordingly , propose randomize placebo-controlled trial 319 men UTI test hypothesis 7 day antimicrobial treatment non-inferior resolution UTI symptom compare 14 day treatment . This study provide valuable information VA patient clinicians regard common understudied clinical decision .</detailed_description>
