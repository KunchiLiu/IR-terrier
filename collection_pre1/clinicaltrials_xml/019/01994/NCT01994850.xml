	<criteria>Age 18 Histologically confirm CD30positive , CD20positive untreated primary mediastinal Bcell lymphoma ( Ann Arbor stage ) , diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( Ann Arbor stage III IV ) , grey zone lymphoma ( Ann Arbor stage ) . Patients heterogeneous , weak equivocal CD30 staining also include ( specific cut percentage CD30 stain require ) . Measurable disease , define Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma ( Cheson et al . 2007 , 579586 ) . Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mmᶟ platelet count ≥75,000/µL ( unless document bone marrow involvement lymphoma ) . Normal leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥50 % estimate MUGA scan echocardiogram . Estimated creatinine clearance ( use CockcroftGault equation ) must &gt; 50 mL/min . Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN permit individual document liver involvement lymphoma due know Gilbert syndrome . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 x ULN . Performance status ECOG 02 ; patient ECOG 3 may allow enroll discussion RegulatorySponsor/Principal Investigator medical monitor , performance status believe secondary lymphoma relate symptom performance status expect improve chemotherapy commences . Capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide valid inform consent . In patient able consent trial due medical circumstance , next kin power Females childbearing potential must negative serum urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( bhcG ) pregnancy test result within 7 day prior first dose brentuximab vedotin must agree use effective contraception method study 30 day follow last dose study drug ; female nonchildbearing potential postmenopausal 1 year bilateral tubal ligation hysterectomy . Males partner childbearing potential must agree use effective contraceptive method study 6 month follow last dose study drug . Must able comply study followup requirement . Previous use investigational agent , chemotherapyor immunotherapy lymphoma time prior enrollment ( i.e . must untreated disease ) . Prior allogeneic autologous transplant also allow . Current concomitant chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy specify protocol . Consolidative radiation therapy ( RT ) completion plan course and/or concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy CNS disease prophylaxis permissible . Treatment systemic steroid &gt; 4 week prior Cycle 1 Day 1 study therapy . Prior radiation therapy , exception abbreviate course ( 3 day ) use SVC syndrome . History serious organ dysfunction disease involve heart ( leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % ; unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction within 6 month prior randomization , congestive heart failure NYHA IIIIV , arrhythmia unless control therapy , exception extra systole minor conduction abnormality . ) , kidney ( creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min ) , liver ( chronic hepatitis B define elevate AST , ALT alkaline phosphase &gt; 3 ULN ; serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ; bilirubin 3 x ULN permit individual document liver involvement lymphoma due know Gilbert syndrome ) ot organ system may place patient undue risk undergo treatment . Uncontrolled systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , serious infection ( define exhibit ongoing signs/symptoms related infectionand without improvement , despite appropriate antibiotic treatment ) . May enrol control treatment . Significant concurrent disease , illness psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliace , interfere consent , study participation , followup , interpretation study result . Subjects current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver involved lymphoma stable chronic liver disease per investigator 's assessment ) . History significant cerebrovascular disease past 6 month ongoing event active symptom sequela . Other malignancy , unless patient diseasefree least 3 year follow completion curative intent therapy , follow exception : Treated nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , regardless disease free duration , eligible study definitive treatment condition completed.Organconfined prostate cancer evidence recurrent progressive disease base prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) value also eligible study hormonal therapy initiate , radical prostatectomy definitive prostate irradiation perform . Positive test Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) unless undetectable viral load within 3 month enrollment ( HIV RNA le 48 copies/mL ) HAART therapy . Positive serology hepatitis B ( HB ) define positive test hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis B core antibody . Active involvement central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma . Workup CNS involvement diagnosis direct per treat physician depend specific clinical circumstance ( brain image lumbar puncture require protocol ) . Pregnant lactating woman .</criteria>
