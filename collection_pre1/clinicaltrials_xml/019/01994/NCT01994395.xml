	<brief_summary>Hypothesis/Specific Aims : The purpose study determine effect train Stride Management Assist ( SMA ) device vs. Impairment base physical therapy ( IPT ) descend corticospinal drive lower limb muscle patient post stroke . The investigator hypothesize long-term SMA use would strengthen connection motor area brain low limb . Specifically , individual SMA group show high corticospinal excitability lower limb muscle compare IPT group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial compare task specific train Stride Management Assist ( SMA ) device verse impairment base physical therapy ( IPT ) approach functional walking ability outpatient stroke rehabilitation . Participants age 18-80 30 day great post stroke include . This SMA robotic device assist hip flexion extension , side independently . It control software run tablet . The device weigh 2.8 kg , 2 brushless direct current motor run rechargeable lithium ion battery . It come 3 size ( small , medium large ) . It wear around like belt motor near hip strap thigh . The SMA device allow user increase stride length provide assist motor flexion extension . This device 1 ) simple use clinical setting ; 2 ) easily adjustable alter accord requirement subject ; , 3 ) quantify amount assistance require facilitate walking pattern . Participants post stroke 30 day great recruited inpatient , day rehabilitation outpatient clinic . Participants schedule 18 Sessions outpatient physical therapy plus 3 session test . The amount session provide dependent upon compatibility device ability tolerate device . A participant continue session study deem appropriate research staff . - A . Phase I . ( session 0 ) : After consent , subject undergo physical evaluation screen exam license physical therapist . If meet study criterion , randomly place either SMA group IPT group use random number generator enter study . Once enrol , baseline outcome measure assess blind research physical therapist . - B . Phase II . ( session 1-9 ) : - Stride Management Assist Group : Treatment consist 30 minute high intensity gait training device , 15 minute functional mobility device . - Impairment Based Physical Therapy Group : Treatment divide : 15 min balance training , 15 minute functional mobility ( transfer , strength flexibility training ) 15 min high intensity gait train - C. Phase III . ( session 10 ) : Mid treatment assessment . Outcome measure assess blind research physical therapist . - D. Phase II . ( session 11-19 ) : - Stride Management Assist Group : Treatment consist 30 minute high intensity gait training device , 15 minute functional mobility device . - Impairment Based Physical Therapy Group : Treatment divide : 15 min balance training , 15 minute functional mobility ( transfer , strength flexibility training ) 15 min high intensity gait train - E. Phase IV . ( session 20 ) : Post Testing . Outcome measure assess blind research physical therapist . All test training session supervision license physical therapist . All subject permit stop physical activity rest time study . Adverse event record . The investigator anticipate study help determine Stride Management Assist practical option well strengthen connection brain low limb . The investigator foresee potential pitfall .</detailed_description>
