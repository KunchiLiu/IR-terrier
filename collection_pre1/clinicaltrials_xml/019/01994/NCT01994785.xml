	<brief_title>Use Capnography EGD Colonoscopy With Moderate Sedation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure currently perform United States do moderate sedation , primarily utilize combination opioid benzodiazepine . The endoscopy team administers medication , commonly endoscopy nurse team discretion endoscopist , careful cardiopulmonary monitoring procedure . The use sedation lead serious unplanned adverse event . Cardiopulmonary event relate use sedation GI endoscopy include hypotension , hypoxia , hypopnea/apnea . The common adverse event hypoxia , occur 10-70 % patient . Although event transient respond supplemental oxygenation , study show electrocardiographic sign cardiac ischemia patient know preexist heart disease . Pulse oximetry help detect hypoxia relate perfusion deficit ( cardiac ) ventilation factor ( respiratory ) however , design detect ventilator precursor alveolar hypoventilation , primarily present decreased respiratory rate hypopnea/apnea . Capnography utilizes near-infrared spectrophotometric absorption spectrum carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) 420 nm provide graphic assessment ventilation status via partial pressure carbon dioxide respiratory cycle . Previous study show improve safety detect early indicator hypoxia and/or sign alveolar hypoventilation . Studies show target deep sedation advance endoscopic procedure utilize capnography superior pulse oximetry alone detect respiratory depression . There also evidence show utilize capnography advance endoscopic procedure significantly decrease incidence hypoxia versus standard monitoring procedural team blind capnographic data ( 132 blind vs. 49 open , P &lt; .001 ) rate hypoxia ( 69 % blind vs. 46 % open , P &lt; .001 ) significantly low capnography monitoring . Routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) colonoscopy moderate sedation safe rate sedation associate adverse event occur 8 per 100,000 case . Lightdale colleague show prospective , double blind randomize control trial pediatric population undergo routine EGD colonoscopy target moderate sedation opioid-benzodiazepine combination patient intervention capnography arm less likely ( 4 % vs. 20 % , P &lt; .03 ) intra-procedural episode hypoxia ( define SpO2 &lt; 95 % &gt; 5sec ) . No adverse event related episode hypoxia report trial , underpowered evaluate outcome . To knowledge , data use capnography adult patient undergo EGD colonoscopy target moderate sedation combination opioid benzodiazepine . The American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) recently update standard basic anesthetic monitoring state moderate sedation patient capnographic monitoring . This updated previous standard basic monitoring state capnography could use level sedation . This significant change practice model monitor patient undergoing routine endoscopy moderate sedation , standard basic monitoring often used basis regulatory guideline apply hospital ambulatory care center , addition require capnographic monitoring change landscape procedural sedation gastrointestinal endoscopy across United States . The evidence cite update monitoring guideline include Lightdale pediatric endoscopy study group study utilized capnography advance endoscopic procedure . There data available adult patient undergoing routine EGD colonoscopy time update guideline . The extrapolation advance endoscopic procedure routine endoscopy limit use procedure target different level sedation ( deep vs. moderate , respectively ) length procedure significantly different . The rationale use capnography moderate sedation arises ability lead false alarm , pseudo-apnea secondary swallowing failure monitor oral nasal airways respiratory activity , patient transition nasal mouth breathe sedation . These alarm procedure may lead interruption , delay , early termination . Increased cost capnography equipment appropriately train endoscopy team member interpret capnography result difficult accomplish patient data support effectiveness use routine EGD colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
