	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether reduced load patient plantar fasciitis ( reduced standing , walk , land ) together either control heavy resistance training glucocorticosteroid injection combination thereof best treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Treatment Plantar Fasciitis : Physical Training , Glucocorticoid Injections Combination Thereof .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plantar fasciitis ( PF ) frequently diagnose condition , define pain medial tubercle calcaneus , 10 % population point life experience condition . Accumulated load plantar fascia seem relate development PF , commonly see runner overweight , number daily step simply time stand show predispose factor PF development . Orthosis glucocorticoid injection 2 widely use treatment proven effect . However treatment overuse injury tendon/aponeurosis-like structure , later year dominate increase documentation good curative effect heavy control mechanical loading ( eccentric strength exercise heavy slow concentric strength training ) upon tendinopathies Achilles patella tendon . However , study look influence physical training ( e.g . strength training ) diseased plantar aponeurosis . Also study look effect combination give local glucocorticoid injection train tendon overuse entity . We hypothesize heavy strength train positive effect upon PF , combination training glucocorticoid injection additive effect upon disease even effective treatment alone . Glucocorticoid injection act standard control treatment .</detailed_description>
