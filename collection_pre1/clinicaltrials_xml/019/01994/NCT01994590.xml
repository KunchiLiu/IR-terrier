	<brief_title>Dovitinib ( TKI258 ) Abiraterone Acetate Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , take study drug 28-day cycle . Dovitinib : You take dovitinib capsule mouth 1 time day Days 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 cycle . You take dovitinib cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You may take dovitinib without food . If miss dose dovitinib Days 1-4 , 8-11 , 15-18 , 22-25 , make dose day . You continue take drug schedule following day . If miss dose Days 5 , 12 , 19 , 26 , skip dose , wait 2 day , start take dovitinib schedule ( Day 8 , 15 , 22 , 1 next cycle ) . The study doctor talk else need miss dose . Abiraterone Acetate : You take 4 abiraterone acetate tablet mouth 1 time day least 1 hour meal 2 hour meal . You take abiraterone acetate tablet time day swallow whole water . Do crush chew abiraterone acetate tablet . Prednisone : You take 1 tablet prednisone mouth 2 time day ( morning , even ) help low risk side effect cause abiraterone acetate . You return unused study drug and/or empty pill bottle clinic end cycle . If side effect , study doctor may lower dose dovitinib and/or abiraterone acetate . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check PSA level , check well blood clot . You must fast least 8 hour blood draw . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 , blood also use biomarker test . - Urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 , every odd-numbered cycle afterward ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , ) : - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect test marker relate bone . On Day 1 Cycles 1-3 , EKG . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , Day 1 every 3 cycle ( Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 , ) , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn test thyroid function . On Day 14 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test check well blood clot . You must fast least 8 hour blood draw . - Urine collect routine test . On Day 14 Cycles 2 3 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Every 8 week first 6 month every 3 month , chest x-ray , bone scan , either CT MRI scan abdomen pelvis check status disease . About 7-10 week first dose study drug , another bone marrow biopsy aspiration perform check status disease biomarker test . At Weeks 12 24 , echocardiogram MUGA scan . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You may longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 4 week last dose study drug , return clinic end-of-treatment visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test check PSA level . This blood also use biomarker test . You need fast least 8 hour blood draw . - Urine collect test marker relate bone . You chest x-ray , bone scan , CT scan , and/or MRI abdomen pelvis check status disease . - You EKG either echocardiogram MUGA scan check heart function . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration perform check status disease biomarker test . Long-Term Follow-up : The study staff check ask every 3 month end-of-treatment visit . This update consist phone call , e-mail , clinic visit . If contact phone , call would last 5 minute . This investigational study . Dovitinib FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Abiraterone acetate FDA approve combination prednisone treatment metastatic CRPC patient receive docetaxel . Its use study investigational . Prednisone FDA approve commercially available corticosteroid . It commonly use abiraterone acetate . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 60 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
