	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Intranasal Glucagon Treatment Hypoglycemia Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucagon , treatment choice severe hypoglycemia outside hospital setting , currently available powder must mix diluent immediately prior administration injection . Although simple procedure insulin-using individual , subject experience severe hypoglycemia inject glucagon disable effect severe neuroglycopenia . For non-medical person confront emergency situation patient diabetes hypoglycemic coma suffer hypoglycemia-related convulsion , reconstitution injection current injectable glucagon complex daunt procedure . When use recommend dose 1 mg injection , glucagon often cause substantial , although transient , hyperglycemia often accompany nausea vomiting . The data generate date AMG504-1 suggest result glucagon pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , although less observed injected glucagon , result therapeutic blood glucose increment low incidence gastrointestinal adverse effect . The procedure evaluate efficacy AMG504-1 consist essentially inducing hypoglycemia intravenous ( IV ) infusion regular insulin dilute normal saline . The insulin infusion use decrease glucose target &lt; 50 mg/dL . The insulin infusion stop plasma glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL . Five minute stop insulin infusion , participant treat either 3 mg glucagon dose intranasally 1 mg glucagon administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection deltoid muscle non-dominant arm . During 5-minute period insulin infusion stop , glucose level expect continue decrease additional 15-20 mg/dL . It believe nadir &lt; 50 mg/dL low enough generate clinical symptom participant yet high enough avoid impairment consciousness . Blood glucose level adverse event carefully monitor 90 minute post-dosing . After wash-out period 7 day , participant return clinic procedure repeat participant cross treatment . As , participant undergo two episode insulin-induced hypoglycemia random order receive AMG504-1 one episode commercially available glucagon ( GlucaGen , Novo Nordisk ) IM injection episode .</detailed_description>
