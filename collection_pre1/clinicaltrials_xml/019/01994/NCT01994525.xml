	<brief_title>Immunization Via Mosquito Bite With Radiation-attenuated Sporozoites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 open-labeled study . In addition safety tolerability Plasmodium falciparum Sporozoites ( PfRAS ) , study comprehensive , system biology-based effort identify validate biomarkers protection PfRAS immunization , compare sterility protect nonprotected study subject . The goal trial design achieve approximately 50 % sterile protection order facilitate identification biomarkers correlate protection . Following true-immunization mock-immunization , study subject nonimmunized infectivity control receive challenge via bite 5 An stephensi mosquito carry infectious P falciparum sporozoite within controlled clinical environment ( control human malaria infection , CHMI ) determine level sterile protection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Healthy adult ( male nonpregnant , nonbreastfeeding female ) 1850 year age ( inclusive ) . Available willing participate duration study . Able willing provide write informed consent . Able complete Assessment Understanding score least 70 % correct . In good general health clinically significant health problem establish medical history , physical exam laboratory screening . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screen agree become pregnant breastfeed duration study . She must willing use reliable form contraception study . Reliable form birth control include use condom , diaphragm cervical cap , birth control pill , IUD sperm kill product . Agree refrain blood donation ( except require study ) 3 year follow P falciparum challenge . Agree travel malariaendemic region study . Good peripheral venous access . Positive HIV , HBsAg , HCV serology . Positive sickle cell screen test , include evidence sickle trait . Reactivity CSP AMA1 ELISpot assay ELISA determine IMRAS Study Specific Procedure # 204 . Anemia ( normal reference laboratory value hemoglobin ) screening . Weight le 110 pound ( apply infectivity control weight cutoff subject undergoing leukapheresis procedure ) Any history malaria infection travel malaria endemic region within 6 month prior first immunization . History longterm residence ( &gt; 5 year ) area know significant transmission Pf [ cumulative lifetime exposure ] . Use systemic immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy great 10 day within 60 day schedule first immunization ( inhaled topical steroid allow ; short duration taper corticosteroid regimen 10 day less discontinued prior first immunization allow ) . Current significant medical condition ( cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , pulmonary , hematological ) evidence serious underlie medical condition identify medical history , physical examination , laboratory examination ( include bleed disorder ) . Plan surgery enrollment day 28 postchallenge ( minor procedure , elective corrective vision surgery , dental procedure allow ) . Receipt immunoglobulin and/or blood product within 90 day schedule leukapheresis immunization . Version 13.0 ( 08May2015 ) 70 US Government Proprietary Deleted : 8 Deleted : 08JULY2014 Has evidence increase cardiovascular disease risk ( define &gt; 5 % 10 % , 5year risk ) determine method Gaziano ( 2008 ) . Risk factor include sex , age ( year ) , systolic blood pressure ( mm Hg ) , smoke status , body mass index ( BMI , kg/m2 ) , report diabetes status , blood pressure . An abnormal electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , define one show pathologic Q wave significant STT wave change ; leave ventricular hypertrophy ; nonsinus rhythm exclude isolated premature atrial contraction ; right leave bundle branch block ; advance ( secondary tertiary ) AV heart block . History splenectomy . History illness condition , investigator 's judgment , may substantially increase risk associate subject 's participation protocol compromise scientific objective . This may include psychiatric disorder ( personality disorder , anxiety disorder , schizophrenia ) behavioral tendency ( include active alcohol drug abuse ) discover screen process opinion investigator would make compliance protocol difficult . History anaphylactic severe response mosquito bite , retinal visual field change , know allergy antimalarial chloroquine phosphate , use treat subject develop malaria CHMI . Participation study involve investigational vaccine drug within 30 day prior screen visit , plan participate another investigational vaccine/drug research within 1 month follow participation study . Use plan use drug antimalarial activity would coincide immunization challenge . History psoriasis porphyria , may exacerbate treatment chloroquine . Anticipated use medication know cause drug reaction chloroquine atovaquoneproguanil ( Malarone ) cimetidine , metoclopramide , antacid , kaolin day 7 28 postchallenge period . Any significant finding , investigator 's judgment , may substantially increase risk associate subject 's participation study compromise scientific objective .</criteria>
