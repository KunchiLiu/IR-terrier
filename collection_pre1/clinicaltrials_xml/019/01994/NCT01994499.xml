	<brief_summary>Infectious pleural effusion classic complication pneumonia often require pleural drainage . There consensus surgical drainage medical drainage indication first intention treat empyema . Usually surgery proposed second intention failure medical drainage . Videothoracoscopy well accept diagnosis treatment pleural pathology . The morbidity approach low good result become gold standard different pleural disease . The medical drainage also efficient result depend evolution pleural effusion . The rate failure estimate around 25 % . Then , aim study compare surgical drainage medical drainage first intention . The first end-point hospital stay ( day ) . Hospital discharge strict , follow different objective criterion heal allow comparison two approach drainage . To answer question randomize 50 patient 2 year multicenter recruitment .</brief_summary>
