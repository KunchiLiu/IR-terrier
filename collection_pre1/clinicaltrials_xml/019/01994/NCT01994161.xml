	<brief_summary>This trial prospective , government-funded registration study observe safety effectiveness intracranial stenting prevent stroke mean follow-up 12 month patient symptomatic stenosis major intracranial artery ( MCA , carotid , vertebral , basilar ) . This trial launch Xuanwu Hospital , Capital University Medical Science , 20 collaborator participate . Enrollment begin 2013 , aim sample size 840 subject 2 year . The trial schedule complete 2015 . As know , SAMMPRIS flaw defect design , heterogeneity experience credential operator high rate complication ; Whether interventional therapy symtomatic intracranial artery stenosis effective remain resolve . This trial modify base SAMMPRIS order acquire data China : Technique , experience , credential operator closely related perioperative complication PTAS . The investigator select 50 large-scale medical center participation basis geographical distribution . All participant rank top China . They experience surgeon interventionist China , fully qualify trial . This guarantee success safety technique , maintain continuity operator 's experience , make complication rate low possible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : Clinical Registration Trial Intracranial Stenting Patients With Symptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis : A Prospective Multi-center , Registry Trial Design trial : This trial prospective , government-funded registration study observe safety effectiveness intracranial stenting prevent stroke mean follow-up 3 year patient symptomatic stenosis major intracranial artery ( MCA , carotid , vertebral , basilar ) . This trial launch Xuanwu Hospital , Capital University Medical Science , 40 collaborator participate . Enrollment begin 2013 , aim sample size 840 subject 2 year . The trial schedule complete 2015 . Details : SAMMPRIS ( Stenting v . Aggressive Medical Management Preventing Recurrent Stroke Intracranial Stenosis ) n't receive expected result ; But , mean angioplasty stent intracranial treatment come full stop . On contrary , discrepancy report data multi-centre RCT single center study urge u thorough investigation future . As know , SAMMPRIS flaw defect design , heterogeneity experience credential operator high rate complication ; Some question SAMMPRIS raise , remain unresolved . This trial modify base SAMMPRIS order acquire data China : Technique , experience , credential operator closely related perioperative complication PTAS . The investigator select 40 large-scale medical center participation basis geographical distribution . All participant rank top China . They experience surgeon interventionist China , fully qualify trial . This guarantee success safety technique , maintain continuity operator 's experience , make complication rate low possible . SAMMPRIS stop ahead schedule due safety concern . More half PTAS patient lose follow-up 1 year , remain follow mean duration less 1 year . It leave question long-time follow-up data open . Base SAMMPRIS , investigator ' trial conduct systematic follow-up system . Upon recruitment , patient ' neurological image examination determine baseline , 1 week , 1 month , 6 month , 12 month surgery , respectively .</detailed_description>
