	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common type irregular heartbeat emergency department ( ED ) patient . If irregular heartbeat present le 48 hour , chance emergency treatment convert heartbeat normal rhythm . There currently two option accomplish ; widely safely used EDs . Each advantage disadvantage . This study compare two method . ( 1 ) Patients give intravenous medication call procainamide ; convert patient normal heart rhythm around 50 % time . ( 2 ) Patients sedate ( put sleep general anesthetic ) ten minute , electrical current conduct across chest ; convert patient normal heart rhythm around 90 % time . Procainamide cause low blood pressure 10 % patient ; usually correct administer intravenous fluid . Sedation cause low blood pressure 10 % patient , breathe trouble 10 % patient ; usually correct administer intravenous fluid , administer oxygen , respectively . In thousand patient study around world , appear report stroke death result procedure . A physician choose one method , fail , move next method . There thus two option . ( 1 ) Chemical conversion , follow electrical conversion ; ( 2 ) Electrical cardioversion , follow chemical cardioversion . These option 90 % + chance convert AF normal heart rhythm . However , investigator believe electrical-chemical sequence faster chemical-electrical sequence , equally safe . If patient agree take part study , randomize one two option . They breathe , oxygen level , blood pressure , heartbeat monitor entire ED stay . The investigator plan enrol 86 patient five hospital course one year . The primary outcome ED length-of-stay , well secondary outcome , conversion normal rhythm , adverse event ( trouble breathe low blood pressure ) document . In addition , investigator contact three thirty day visit make sure problem . Importantly , although principal site investigator aware primary outcome , attend emergency physician actually provide patient care NOT aware primary outcome -- otherwise could bias patient management . When study finish , result give write committee merely `` A '' `` B '' arm , specify either `` chemical-first '' `` electrical-first '' arm . The write committee compose two manuscript , ( 1 ) assume `` A '' `` chemical-first '' arm `` B '' `` electrical-first '' arm , ( 2 ) assume `` A '' `` electrical-first '' arm , `` B '' `` chemical-first '' arm . After manuscript approve author , blind remove correct manuscript submit publication .</brief_summary>
