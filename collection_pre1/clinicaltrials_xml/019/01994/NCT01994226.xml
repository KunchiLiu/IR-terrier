	<brief_summary>Gout common cause inflamed joint affect 1.4 % adult UK . Most patient treat entirely general practice yet primary care management frequently suboptimal . Acute attack gout excruciatingly painful require urgent drug treatment reduce inflammation , commonly antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) colchicine .

However , general practitioner ( GPs ) prescribe colchicine infrequently , probably past recommendation high dos prescribe commonly cause severe diarrhoea . Recently , prescribe recommendation colchicine change , advocate low dose regime . Currently evidence regard whether NSAIDs low-dose colchicine best treatment acute gout . This trial first direct comparison effectiveness side effect NSAID ( naproxen ) low-dose colchicine treat acute gout primary care . Naproxen use trial show effective oral prednisolone treatment acute gout , safe commonly use NSAIDs diclofenac indomethacin , inexpensive . Patients consult GP acute attack gout 100 general practice invite participate . Treatment success assess compare pain reduction two drug . The trial also monitor side effect , quality life , cost effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gout prevalent inflammatory arthritis . It largely manage primary care treatment often suboptimal . Acute gout cause attack excruciate joint pain require rapid treatment . In primary care , treatment frequently non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) effective frequent gastrointestinal , cardiovascular renal side-effects , particularly elderly . Oral colchicine use treat acute gout many year although high-doses cause intolerable gastrointestinal side-effects . Low-dose colchicine think effective better-tolerated recommend British National Formulary . However , direct comparison NSAID low-dose colchicine acute gout . This pragmatic randomise trial compare effectiveness low-dose colchicine ( 500 mcg three time every eight hour ) naproxen ( 750 mg immediately follow 250 mg every eight hour ) reduce pain adult age 18 year consult GP acute gout , recruit 100 general practice . People experience first attack gout recurrent attack eligible participate . However , patient register participate practice consult gout precede two year mail letter invitation Participant Information Sheet inform trial take place encourage consult GP experience attack acute gout . Eligibility assessment , informed consent , randomisation , baseline data collection prescription perform patient consults primary care acute gout . Outcome measure collect via self-complete questionnaire day 1-7 ( daily diary ) , 4 week . The primary outcome measure change worst pain intensity previous 24 hour measure daily day 0-7 . Secondary outcome measure include side-effects , time treatment response , patient global assessment response treatment , adherence treatment , use medication pain relief , cost . A sample size 200 patient per treatment arm provide 90 % power detect minimum clinically important treatment effect small standardise effect size 0.3 treatment group .</detailed_description>
