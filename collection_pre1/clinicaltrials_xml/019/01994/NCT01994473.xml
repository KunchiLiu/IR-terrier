	<brief_title>Study Assessing Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics SEP-363856 Male Female Subjects With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter study conduct 2 part ( Part 1 2 ) . Part 1 study multicenter , randomize , single-blind , placebo-controlled portion , ascend multiple oral dose study design evaluate safety , tolerability , PK ascend multiple oral dos SEP-363856 metabolite SEP-363854 male female subject schizophrenia . Part 1 This study determine MTD once-daily multiple oral administration SEP-363856 , characterize plasma urine PK profile SEP-363856 metabolite SEP-363854 male female subject schizophrenia . The effect SEP-363856 PANSS , CGI-S , CDSS scale also assess . For dose-escalation cohort , 12 subject ( 9 active subject 3 placebo subject ) dose 7 consecutive day serial collection PK blood sample first last dos , daily collection trough PK blood sample . An attempt make least one-third subject cohort female . Part 2 study open-label safety tolerability study design gain longer-term safety tolerability data 75 mg SEP-363856 give once-daily 28 day male female subject schizophrenia . The effect SEP-363856 PANSS , CGI-S , CDSS scale also assess . In Part 2 , 16 subject dose .</detailed_description>
