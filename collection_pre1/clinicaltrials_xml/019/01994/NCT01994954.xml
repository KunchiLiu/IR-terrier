	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize Recorded Home Oximetry ( RHO ) utilization increase rate respiratory-related re-hospitalizations ED visit , impair growth compare standard oxygen management protocol . Evidence-based specific consensus guideline home regulate oxygen management currently exist . Current strategy infant require outpatient supplemental home oxygen include brief check oxygen status monthly clinic visit . Although infant stay monitor , data visit obtain ensure infant maintain oxygen level weans make . Before finally allow oxygen remove , many center also require overnight sleep study hospital , make sure infant 's oxygen level stay safe infant deep sleep . Because method rely solely assumption rather individually record data , infant 's time supplemental oxygen may prolong insufficient . This study evaluate currently use accept therapy method wean involves record send oxygen data analysis clinic visit . Premature infant require home oxygen therapy time discharge meet eligibility criterion randomize two arm : Arm A ( `` Standard therapy '' ) : Infants ' oxygen increase , decrease , maintain base brief structured assessment monthly clinic visit . Arm B ( Recorded Home Oximetry ( RHO ) ) : Infants monthly clinic assessment Arm A , also utilize Recorded Home Oximetry ( RHO ) potentially increase , decrease maintain oxygen monthly visit . Parents infant interview use structure quality-of-life questionnaire begin end oxygen management process . Health care utilization ( emergency department visit rehospitalizations ) growth assess 6 month discontinuation oxygen . The investigator overall objective determine whether Recorded Home Oximetry ( RHO ) improve caregiver quality life , shorten Home Oxygen Therapy ( HOT ) duration eliminate need polysomnogram , without compromise safety . The investigator determine respiratory-related re-hospitalizations , emergency department ( ED ) visit , growth parameter confirm safety propose wean strategy .</brief_summary>
