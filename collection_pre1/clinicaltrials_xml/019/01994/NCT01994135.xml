	<brief_summary>Consumption carbohydrate contain food sugary drink brings change blood glucose level . After meal drink , blood glucose level rise reach peak concentration usually 30 minute . When body sense increase blood glucose , hormonal process involve insulin take place ensure glucose take blood storage need energy body . This process bring decrease concentration glucose reach approximately starting concentration . The original concentration glucose attain approximately 2 hour eat drink carbohydrate food sugary drink respectively . Different carbohydrates sugary drink different effect blood glucose response depend amount well type carbohydrate . Those give rise high glucose response compare reference carbohydrate ( usually glucose ) say high glycaemic index ( GI ) food low glucose response compare reference carbohydrate ( usually glucose ) say low glycaemic index ( GI ) food . ( 1 ) Research show diet give rise high glucose response associate number abnormality like increase metabolic syndrome ( 2 ) . Metabolic syndrome mostly comprise insulin resistance glucose intolerance give increase risk type 2 diabetes . ( 3 ) It also give rise condition like high blood pressure ( arterial hypertension ) , elevate blood insulin level ( hyper-insulinemia ) , elevate amount fat liver ( fatty hepatosis ) elevate amount lipid blood ( dyslipidemia ) . After type 2 diabetes become clinically apparent , risk cardiovascular disease also rise . ( 4 ) Research also show foods/drinks raise blood glucose level gradually ( low GI ) rather rapidly ( high GI ) health benefit include reduce risk metabolic syndrome ( 5 ) . In vitro study show polyphenols find fruit , vegetable plant base food positive effect carbohydrate metabolism lower blood glucose level . ( 6 ) This research determine whether presence polyphenols diet lower effect blood glucose level hence glycaemic index food . This determine ask volunteer consume polyphenol rich drink/food together white bread determine glycaemic response . The GI bread determine initially reference . Analysis do measure blood glucose response white bread alone reference white bread test sample containing polyphenols determine GI see GI bread affect . Other analyse do plasma insulin , glucagon , gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( GIP ) glucagon like peptides-1 ( GLP-1 ) relate glycaemic response . Study hypothesis glucose metabolism affect . NOTE : 1 . Only healthy participant undertook study ( Hence metabolic syndrome participant part study ) 2 . Only glucose insulin analyse plasma ( hence GIP , GLP-1 glucagon part end point )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Carbohydrase-inhibiting Polyphenols Glycaemic Response Vivo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The world health organisation report 220 million people suffer diabetes worldwide year 2030 , number double . The WHO also report 2004 , 3.4 million people died high blood sugar ( WHO fact sheet number 312 , January 2011 ) . About 90 % diabetes case due type II diabetes . Type 2 diabetes largely due overweight lack physical activity characterise high glucose level ( hyperglycaemia ) . In human diet , source blood glucose carbohydrate . Dietary carbohydrate important maintain glycaemic homeostasis provide energy diet people . The control blood glucose hormonal process important human physiology . Hormonal process involve release insulin β- cell pancreatic cell stimulates uptake glucose meal , tissue either utilisation ( glycolysis ) store liver glycogen ( glycogenesis ) . When blood glucose fall normal , glucagon secrete pancreatic α-cells promotes liver glucose production induce generation glucose non carbohydrate substrate amino fatty acid ( gluconeogenesis ) generation glucose glycogen ( glycogenolysis ) . In addition insulin glucagon , gut hormone also play role control plasma glucose concentration body . The two important peptide hormone call Glucagon like peptides-1 ( GLP-1 ) Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide ( GIP ) . They say incretin activity ( promotion glucose dependent insulin secretion ) . GIP secrete upper small intestine K cell primary function stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion act pancreatic islet . It also stimulate glucagon say respond presence nutrient ( Seino et al. , 2010 ) . GLP-1 secrete low intestine colon L cell follow exposure ingested nutrient . It also stimulate insulin secretion biosynthesis inhibits glucagon . GLP-1 say health disease relate function ( Marathe et al. , 2013 ) . When glucose homeostasis hormonal control fail , entail high blood glucose level ( postprandial hyperglycaemia ) lead metabolic syndrome include obesity , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , hypertension dyslipidemia . Disturbance glucose homeostasis also lead symptom inflammation oxidative stress whole body level well disturbances functionality several organ well diabetes ( Hanhineva et al ) . Therefore , much carbohydrate require human body major source energy , much diet adverse health effect especially one high glycaemic effect . The propose mechanism adapt ( Aston , 2006 ) carbohydrate may affect human health continual presence high glycaemic index food diet , give rise postprandial glucose rise well high insulin demand act high blood glucose level blood . This action hormones GIP GLP-1 stimulate insulin release sense presence nutrient . Postprandial glucose rise high insulin demand may lead insulin resistance major component metabolic syndrome . High insulin demand may also lead β-cell failure may also result hyperglycaemia also cause insulin resistance . Insulin resitance hyperglycaemia risk factor metabolic syndrome diabetes type 2 . Scientific evidence suggest postprandial hyperglycaemia human major role play health priority like type 2 diabetes blood glucose control . It report 90 % diabetes case consist type 2 diabetes . Apart type I type 2 diabetes , related condition include pre-diabetes ( impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) impair fast glucose ( IFG ) well metabolic syndrome ( obesity , hypertension insulin resistance ) . It report pre-diabetes metabolic syndrome increase risk develop cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus ( Coutinho et al. , 1999 ) . The glycaemic index originally propose aim manage diabetes . However , recent study show GI potential prevention type 2 diabetes well treatment metabolic syndrome . Research show high GI diet associate increase risk develop type 2 diabetes ( Hodge et al. , 2004 ) ( Steven et al. , 2002 ) . More research ( Mckeown et al. , 2004 ) ( Scaglioni et al. , 2004 ) show high GI diet associate number abnormality like increase metabolic syndrome insulin resistance . In way , low GI diet say improve insulin sensitivity research need support . A study like ( Frost et al. , 1996 ) show case . However observed difficult know whether result improve insulin sensitivity , improve insulin secretion due reduce rate glucose absorption . Having anything diet either slow digestion absorption carbohydrates help reduce risk ( Barclay et al. , 2008 ) . Among others , two potential solution consumption low glycaemic index food ingredient diet reduce glycaemic index food well postprandial blood glucose level . The presence inhibit component diet reduce postprandial glucose also solution reduce risk . Drugs like carbose currently use country management type 2 diabetes act inhibit carbohydrate digestive enzyme . However , use acarbose side effect nausea , flatulence diarrhoea . It report polyphenols also potential inhibit rise blood glucose hinder rapid absorption glucose ( Hanhineva et al. , Williamson , 2013 ) . A review ( Hanhineva et al . ) report research use animal model well limited number human study , show polyphenols polyphenol rich food beverages potential affect postprandial glycaemic response fast glycaemia well improvement acute insulin secretion sensitivity . Other possible mechanism report review ( Hanhineva et al . ) , include pancreatic β- cell stimulation secrete insulin well activation insulin receptor , modulation release glucose liver well intracellular signal pathway gene expression . A recent review ( Williamson , 2013 ) conclude possible effect polyphenols diet affect glycaemic index food well postprandial glucose response human . The two mechanism highlight achieved inhibition sugar metabolise enzymes well transporter . This potential action polyphenols thus compare acarbose act mechanism research chronic intervention study show reduces diabetes risk ( Chiasson J. et al. , 2002 ) . The review Williamson , 2013 also mention possibility different mechanism inhibited time would give promising effect . Therefore , effect would observe one suggest pathway inhibit . This research utilise available information literature vitro study carry come food polyphenol rich mixture ( PRM ) containing polyphenols show high inhibition towards carbohydrates digestion absorption different stage . The polyphenol rich breakfast food use test food comprise Green tea combination four fruit extract . For test , PRM consume together bread contain 50g available carbohydrate control meal compose bread , sugar ( fructose , sucrose glucose ) present fruit extract water . The polyphenol rich mixture constituent analyse laboratory total polyphenol content , specific polyphenols inhibitory potential make sure test sample capacity inhibit vitro use human . The result obtain good justifies use human study . The study approve University Leeds Mathermatical Physical Sciences ( MAPs ) ethical commitee application number MEEC12-037 . A total 16 volunteer need complete study healthy fast blood glucose level fall within healthy range 4.3-5.9mmol/L . The volunteer schedule attend 4 visit , per week 4 week . During four visit , volunteer come fasted morning fast blood glucose collect trained nurse . The volunteer give test meal blood sample collect 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120,150 180 minute first bite test meal . On first last visit , save reference meal compose bread , water sugar compensate find fruit extract . On third fourth day , consume test meal either low dose high dose green tea fruit extract addition bread . The blood sample process accordingly obtain plasma store -80°C . Plasma sample analyse concentration glucose , insulin , glucagon , GIP GLP-1 . The result use plot area curve result obtain consume test meal compare obtained consumption control meal . NOTE : 1 . Only healthy participant undertook study ( Hence metabolic syndrome participant part study ) 2 . Only glucose insulin analyse plasma ( hence GIP , GLP-1 glucagon part end point )</detailed_description>
