Only RR-MS patient receive FDA approve immuno-modulatory drug MS include review . Relapses treatment analyze subgroup analysis do receive vitamin D . Magnetic resonance Imaging ( MRI ) brain cervical spine MS patient also review see correlation radiologic change , relapse vitamin D level . The 100 MS patient involve chart review invite participate one time blood draw measure vitamin D level . Additionally , MS patient ask relapse status medication history .
