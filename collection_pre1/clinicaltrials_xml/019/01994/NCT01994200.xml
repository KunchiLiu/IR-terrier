	<brief_summary>While thyroid cancer generally associate favourable prognosis , discrepancy important traumatic impact patient . Quality life ( QoL ) decrease year follow thyroid cancer diagnosis , constitute optimal period preventive intervention . The goal study evaluate impact offer interdisciplinary team-based care approach newly diagnose thyroid cancer patient , include dedicate nurse provide important psychoeducational element identify previous focus group study thyroid cancer patient , i.e. , information : physical illness ; emotional impact newly diagnose thyroid cancer ; surgery ' short- long-term consequence ; radioactive iodine treatment associate safety precaution , nutrition dietary consideration ; cancer diagnosis opportunity make important lifestyle change establish new life-priorities .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Developing Implementing Interdisciplinary Team-Based Care Approach ( ITCA-ThyCa ) Thyroid Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator conduct 2-arm Randomized Controlled Trial compare Interdisciplinary Team-Based Care Approach usual care . The primary research question : Does add Interdisciplinary Team-Based Care Approach ( ITCA-ThyCa ) usual care ( EG ) increase level overall QoL among newly diagnose thyroid cancer patient , compare receive usual care ( UC ) , 9 month post-randomization ( i.e. , dedicated-nurse meeting administer ) judge score Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) ? Primary hypothesis : The EG report high score overall QoL FACT-G UC 9 month post-randomization . Secondary research question : The investigator plan evaluate ITCA-ThyCa effect secondary outcome level : physical health ( SF-36 Physical Health subscale ) , mental health ( SF-36 Mental Health subscale ) , fatigue ( Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue ; FACIT-F ) , anxiety depression ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ; HADS ) , negative illness perception ( Illness Perception Questionnaire - Revised ( IPQ-R ) . The investigator also plan explore ITCA-ThyCa effect satisfaction care ( 16 question NRC Picker satisfaction survey measure patient satisfaction care ) healthcare service use ( types professional consult , frequency visit , time elapse referral first consultation ) . Hypotheses : The EG report high level physical mental health SF-Physical Mental Health subscales , respectively ; low level fatigue FACIT-F , anxiety depression HADS , negative illness perception IPQ-R ; compare UC 9 month post-randomization . All abovementioned change present throughout treatment , namely 7-10 day 5 month post-randomization ( i.e. , immediately meeting plan dedicated nurse ) . All abovementioned change persist 12 month post-randomization ( i.e. , correspond 6 month anti-cancer treatment complete 3 month dedicated-nurse meeting administer ) . Feasibility acceptability ( 9 first month trial ) : The investigator plan test feasibility acceptability 2-arm RCT ITCA-ThyCa first 9 month trial ( investigator start recruiting , first 3-6 month dedicate hire personnel develop manual approach ) . During phase , investigator aim address follow research question : 1 . Can investigators recruit sufficient number patient ( i.e. , minimum 60 patient 6 month 10/month ) retain sufficient proportion thyroid cancer patient ( i.e. , least 80 % 7-10 day , 5 month 9 month post-randomization ) trial arm ? 2 . Is ITCA-ThyCa acceptable least 80 % EG thyroid cancer patient ? Secondary pilot study question 3 . Which evaluation time primary post-randomization , base acceptable retention rate 80 % ? 4 . What variance estimate use inform calculation sample size full study ? If design remain follow pilot , investigator aim roll pilot data full trial .</detailed_description>
