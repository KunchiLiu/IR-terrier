	<brief_title>Differences Response Flu Vaccine Among Adults With HIV Without HIV Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This longitudinal , observational cohort study conduct Makerere University- Johns Hopkins University Research Collaboration , Mulago National Referral Hospital complex Kampala Uganda . The study consist 2 group . One group consist 25 healthy HIV uninfected adult arm consist 35 HIV infect adult . Within HIV infect arm two group , 25 HIV infect adult 10 long term non-progressors . Vaccinees receive primary immunization day 0 , blood sample obtain day 0 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 100 immunization . We analyze early molecular signature ( identify microarray analysis , well FACS analyse innate immune cell luminex analysis cytokine chemokines ) correlate predict later immune response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . For HIV uninfected group Confirmation HIV1 infection medical record 2 . For HIV infect HAART group Confirmation HIV1 infection medical record Participants must HAART least 6 month prior enrollment A CD4 Tcell count available last 6 month CD4 Tcell count &gt; 350 cells/μL eligibility blood specimen 3 . Longterm nonprogressor group HIV infect 7 year No evidence opportunistic infection medical record Never receive antiretroviral therapy ( except antiretrovirals prevention mothertoinfant transmission HIV ) A CD4 Tcell count available last 6 month CD4+ Tcell count slop ≥0 cells/µl blood entry MUJHU cohort recent available CD4+ Tcell count . 1 . Current moderate severe acute illness , history fever temperature ≥37.5oC within 48 hour prior vaccination ( participant reevaluate subsequent visit ) 2 . History systemic disease , include : GuillainBarré Syndrome ; know hepatitis B , hepatitis C infection ; cardiac disease ; uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( include gestational diabetes ) ; chronic liver condition ; clinically significant renal impairment ; clinically significant neurological disorder ; active TB within last year ; Cancer . This information base selfreporting ( possible ) confirm hospital medical record 3 . Received immunoglobulin blood product within precede 3 month expect receipt blood product 3 month followup 4 . History anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction egg protein ( egg egg product ) , component vaccine include trace ( formaldehyde , octoxinol 9 ( Triton X100 ) neomycin ) 5 . History severe reaction ( include hypersensitivity ) receive vaccine 6 . Currently pregnant 7 . In opinion study team would unsuitable study subject receive vaccine participate study .</criteria>
