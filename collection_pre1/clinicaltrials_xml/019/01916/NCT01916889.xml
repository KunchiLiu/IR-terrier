	<brief_summary>Delirium serious medical condition associate increased mortality , long hospital stay , increase rate institutionalisation , decline post-admission functionality . Despite prognostic utility diagnose delirium utility important indicator health quality elderly patient develop country , routinely screen many busy general medical in-patient setting , especially develop country . Unpublished data recent study general medical in-patients Groote Schuur Hospital , Cape Town , South Africa , find patient admitted 8-week period receive formal cognitive test documentation presence/absence delirium routine clinical note . This under-recognition largely result length complexity available delirium diagnostic tool e.g . Mini-mental state exam ( MMSE ) , although perceive lack clinical importance conflict result specific treatment modality also contribute . The investigator recently develop simple 4-question `` RACY '' delirium screen tool use general medical in-patients . Preliminary data show test simple effective sensitivity specificity 78 % 85 % respectively use ROC-selected cut-point RACY≤2 . The investigator hypothesis RACY screen tool potential simple effective bedside delirium diagnostic instrument use non-geriatric , busy general medical in-patient setting . This study two-centre validation study evaluate diagnostic accuracy tool .</brief_summary>
