	<brief_summary>This phase IV investigational trial conduct evaluate efficacy 2-week treatment fluticasone propionate nasal spray ( FPNS ) vs. cetirizine allergic nasal ocular symptom quality life adult subject SAR . It hypothesize FPNS provide great nasal symptom relief cetirizine . The primary measure use test hypothesis change baseline two week reflective total nasal symptom score ( rTNSS ) compare FPNS cetirizine . Approximately 648 subject randomize 1:1:1:1 ratio treatment allocation across approximately twenty-five thirty-five site US 2013 fall allergy season . All subject outpatient . The total duration study approximately 21 day include 7 day screen period , 14 day treatment period .</brief_summary>

An eligible female also lactate plan become pregnant study . Diagnosis SAR , define documented clinical history physician verification subject report historical SAR last two fall allergy season positive skin prick test ( wheal &gt; =3 millimeter [ mm ] large negative control ) prevalent local fall allergen within 12 month prior Visit 1 Visit 1 . Adequate exposure local fall pollen : Subject resides within geographical region exposure local fall pollen sensitize expect moderate great study period . Subject plan travel outside geographical region exposure local fall pollen sensitize expect moderate great 48 hour study period . At Visit 2 , subject must meet follow criterion Eligible subject need moderate severe SAR symptom , define morning rTNSS &gt; =7 least four last seven day lead randomization . This include AM assessment morning randomization visit Visit 2 . Subjects demonstrate least 70 % compliance rate placebo runin study medication ediary completion prior randomization . This period include day Visit 1 day randomization Visit 2 . Subjects significant change medical condition ( ) would exclusionary Visit 1 .
