	<brief_summary>This protocol national , multicenter , comparative , open-label , randomized trial compare progression free survival ( PFS ) two pre-transplant conditioning regimen ( BUMEL versus . MEL-200 ) . A total 460 patient enrol study . Scheduled evaluation study visit take place pre-treatment , treatment follow-up period . The pre-treatment period include screen visit participant provide informed consent write order take part study . The patient assess determine his/her eligibility . The selection process begin 21 day first dose medication administer ( day -21 0 ) . During treatment period , eligible patient include study give six cycle induction treatment bortezomib/ lenalidomide / dexamethasone ( VRD-GEM ) . Each cycle last 28 day , SC bortezomib administer day 1 , 4 , 8 11 , oral lenalidomide day 1-21 cycle , oral dexamethasone day 1-4 9-12 cycle . After first three induction cycle , absence progression unacceptable toxicity , peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell mobilize collected use G-CSF later autologous transplantation . Patients randomize 1:1 allocation ratio receive condition treatment MEL-200 versus BUMEL . Randomization take place begin study , screen complete patient 's eligibility verify . Three month transplantation , patient receive two cycle consolidation treatment VRD-GEM dos administer induction treatment . Once treatment phase complete , patient begin follow-up phase visit every three month evaluate disease progression survival</brief_summary>
