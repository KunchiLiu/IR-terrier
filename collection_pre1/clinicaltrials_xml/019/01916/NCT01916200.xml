	<detailed_description>This open label , randomize , add-on , 8 week multicentre study evaluate efficacy safety paroxetine CR patient MDD comorbid IBS . This study design 1-week screening period , follow 8 week treatment 1 week follow period , 7 visit totally ; calculation visit date base real date random date . Study Screening : Visit 1 : screening period within 7 day determine eligibility study , subject age ≥ 18 ≤ 65 year time screening , must diagnosis IBS MDD . After give informed consent participate study , patient undergo screen assessment , include demographic data ( birth , race , gender , height , weight ) , medical history , disease history , therapy history , concomitant medication , physical examination , vital sign , 12-lead ECG laboratory assessment . Treatment Phase : The treatment phase last 8 week . The visit ( except baseline ) ±3 day . Visit 2 ( Day 0 , baseline visit ) : Patients fulfil study inclusion exclusion criterion accept baseline assessment ( include concomitant medication , vital sign scale assessment ) randomise paroxetine CR plus IBS regular treatment group IBS regular treatment group baseline visit . The day randomize ( Day 1 ) , patient receive paroxetine CR 12.5mg/d plus IBS regular treatment IBS regular treatment ( patient receive IBS regular treatment continue treatment ) . On Day 8 , follow 1 week treatment , paroxetine CR titrate 25mg/d . Visit 3-5 ( Day 14 , Day 28 , Day 42 ) : Efficacy safety assessment perform visit , include vital sign HDRS-17 ( Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17 item ) , CGI-S ( Clinical Global Impression- Severity ) , CGI-I ( Clinical Global Impression- Improvement ) , WHOQOL ( World Health Organization Quality Life Assessment ) , IBSSS ( The Irritable Bowel Severity Scoring System ) . From Week 3 6 , investigator titrate subject 's dose upwards accord clinical response tolerability , maximum rate paroxetine CR 12.5mg every 14 day . For example , CGI-I ≥3 base assessment schedule clinic visit , patient able tolerate increase dose , dose increment next dose level shall consider . The high dose may administer paroxetine CR 50 mg dose titration may occur schedule visit . Visit 6 ( Day 56 ) : Efficacy safety assessment perform visit , include vital sign , physical examination , laboratory assessment HDRS-17 , CGI-S , CGI-I , WHOQOL , IBSSS . If patient experience adverse event ( AE ) investigator deem reduction dose require patient may administer dose one level ( paroxetine CR 12.5 mg ) low take previously . Upon resolution AE , investigator may return patient 's pre-AE dose level . Follow-Up : After treatment phase , investigator communicate subject follow-up choice : reduce continue paroxetine CR treatment/ antidepressant treatment/ transfer psychiatric clinic . It recommend reduce drug dosage treatment period MDD . For subject decide discontinue paroxetine CR treatment : gradual reduction dose rather abrupt cessation recommend whenever possible . The dosage reduce weekly , daily dose reduction 12.5mg per week , week . If intolerable symptom occur follow decrease dose upon discontinuation treatment , resume previously prescribe dose may consider . Subsequently , physician may continue decrease dose gradual rate . Visit 7 ( Day 63 ) : investigator conduct safety follow phone call participant investigate medication situation safety relate information . Withdraw : Patients withdraw study prior Visit 6 ( Week 8 ) end-of-study procedure perform . Patients withdraw study reason attend early withdrawal visit withdrawal study . In addition , patient taper study drug end study dose level high dose level 1 ( paroxetine CR 12.5 mg ) . The dosage reduce weekly , daily dose reduction 12.5mg per week , week .</detailed_description>
