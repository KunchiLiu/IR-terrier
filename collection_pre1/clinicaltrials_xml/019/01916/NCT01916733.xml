	<brief_summary>The aim study examine effect moderate glucose ( blood sugar ) control diabetic non-diabetic patient undergo leg bypass surgery ( LEB ) open abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) repair . We hypothesize use Fletcher Allen Health Care 's current insulin infusion strategy result improve blood sugar control translate decrease postoperative morbidity ( few complication ) good long term outcome compare patient outcome institution utilize blood sugar management strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan concurrent , match cohort study moderate postoperative glucose control patient undergo leg bypass open AAA repair . Consecutive patient undergo elective open AAA repair leg bypass enrol two year period . A population de-identified patient institution region match medical problem receive insulin infusion use control group . Continuous intravenous insulin protocol The insulin infusion strategy local standard care control postoperative hyperglycemia leg bypass surgery . Blood glucose monitor standard open AAA surgery method glucose control could range slide scale insulin use insulin infusion . Diabetic non-diabetic patient place exist Fletcher Allen Health Care standardize algorithm continuous IV insulin immediately surgery continue 72 hour . The insulin infusion initiate if/ finger stick blood glucose great equal 120 mg/dL , target titration goal 80-150 mg/dL . The insulin infusion adjust base defined algorithm use Fletcher Allen Health Care . Primary outcome measure : 1 . Glycemic control measure mean daily glucose level mean daily glucose excursion . We look patient ' finger-stick record record time spend goal glucose level , 80 150 mg/dL . 2 . Surgical site infection ( SSI ) in-hospital define accord Centers Disease Control definition16 infection occurs within 30 day operative procedure involve skin subcutaneous tissue infection include one following : 1. purulent drainage superficial incision 2. organism isolate aseptically obtained culture fluid tissue superficial incision 3. least one follow sign symptoms infection : pain tenderness , localize swelling , redness , heat incision deliberately open surgeon , culture positive culture . Culture negative meet criterion . 4 . Diagnosis superficial incisional SSI surgeon attend . . 3 . Surgical site infection 30 day . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . Moderate severe hypoglycemic hyperglycemic event define moderate hypoglycemic event &lt; 66 mg/dl severe hypoglycemic event &lt; 50 mg/dl moderate hyperglycemic event &gt; 250 mg/dl severe hyperglycemic event &gt; 500 mg/dl . 2 . Composite cardiac complication : myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure clinically significant arrhythmia within 30 day surgery , 3 . Hospital length stay , re-admission total cost hospitalization . Cost data obtain Fletcher Allen Health Care administrative data . At patient 's 4 week follow ask since discharge health related visit ; type anything possibly related surgical procedure obtain participant permission ( write ) gather data provider .</detailed_description>
