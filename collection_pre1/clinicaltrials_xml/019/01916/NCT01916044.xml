	<brief_summary>The rate caesarian dramatically increase 15 year . The main indication caesarian become iterative caesarian principle history caesarian . Any attempt reduction rate caesarian thus focus indication iterative principal caesarean . Nevertheless , main reason usually evoke justify reduction attempt low way caesarian concern generate risk uterine break trial labor . Yet , reliable method predict risk uterine break . A way interesting research consist estimate potential profit echography scar lower segment . Indeed , echography useful determine specific risk uterine break patient measure thickness low segment womb . The strong negative predictive value echography lower segment risk uterine break encourage woman encircle accept trial labor . That , examination associate rule decision could help decrease rate iterative elective caesarian especially decrease mortality foetal maternal morbidity connect trial labor among patient history caesarian .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>`` Lower Uterine Segment Trial ( LUSTrial ) '' Evaluation efficiency ultrasound measure thickness lower segment associate rule decision reduce foetal maternal morbidity mortality coverage delivery woman history caesarian : pragmatic randomized trial Aim Evaluation efficiency ultrasound measure thickness lower segment associate rule decision reduce foetal maternal morbidity mortality coverage delivery woman history caesarian Methodology Randomized trial , multicentric , open , two parallel arm . Evaluated treatment : Between 36+0 38+6 week amenorrhea , patient invite participate study . After agreement , patient respect criterion inclusion inclusion randomize two group : GROUP A ( experimental group ) : The ultra sound measure thickness lower segment realize way standardize expert sonographers . The patient inform case measure : - superior threshold 3.5 mm , consider `` low risk `` complication encourage try event work - subordinate equal threshold 3.5 mm , consider `` risk `` complication encourage give birth iterative elective caesarian . GROUP B ( control group ) : The ultra sound measure lower segment realize . The mode delivery decide accord current clinical practice .</detailed_description>
