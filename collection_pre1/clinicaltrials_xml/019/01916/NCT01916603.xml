	<detailed_description>Introduction : Chile well world , obesity relate chronic disease ( cardiovascular disease , cancer diabetes ( NCDs ) ) presently main cause death disability . Although condition observe mostly adulthood , considerable evidence indicates root first 1000 day life ( -1 + 2yrs life ) . Several study show maternal BMI conception pregnancy predict future risk obesity associate metabolic condition mother offspring . Weight gain first two year life also critical , ensure infant survival , also define infant 's predisposition emergence chronic disease adulthood . From population perspective , effective approach counteract epidemic obesity NCDs prevent . Recommendations healthy diet physical activity pregnancy infancy , well monitor nutrition goal currently available Chilean primary health care system . However , recommendation date virtually poorly implement . Objective : ass effectiveness delivering ( via primary health center ) intervention enhances compliance date nutrition health care standard ( regard diet , physical activity breastfeed promotion ) pregnancy first year life . The main goal mother achieve adequate nutritional status &amp; metabolic control , early pregnancy , infant grow develop healthily ( adequate linear ponderal growth accord WHO standard , avoid excess BMI gain ) Methods : cluster randomize control trial ( CRCT ) , design public health `` program effectiveness '' study ( i.e . intervention available establish national health system standard operate condition ) . The cluster unit 12 primary health care center ( PHCC ) South-East Santiago randomly allocate : 1 ) enhance nutrition health care standard ( intervention group ) 2 ) routine care ( control group ) . Women seek care 15 week pregnancy , resident within catchment area select PHCCs , plan move next two year invite participate study . Pregnant woman classify high risk accord norm Chilean Ministry Health ( MoH ) and/or underweight ( BMI &lt; 18.5 ) exclude . We recruit 200 woman PHCC assume 20 % loss f-up end 960 woman per arm study . After randomization , pregnant woman intervention PHCCs start first pre-natal visit ( &lt; 15 wks . ) receive , diet physical activity ( PA ) counseling-support base updated recommendation monitor goal weight gain &amp; glycemic control breastfeeding ( BF ) promotion till 12 month postpartum . Pregnant woman attend control PHCCs receive routine antenatal care accord national guideline . The outcome : 1 ) achievement adequate nutritional status &amp; metabolic control pregnancy : . Weight gain accord Institute Medicine ( IOM ) recommendation , b. glycemic control base ADA 2011 recommendation , 3 . No weight retention 12 month , 2 ) healthy infant growth development : ) height BMI growth base WHO standard , b ) normal abbreviate psychomotor development test ( TEPSI ) evaluation scale psychomotor development ( EEDP ) 12 month . Mothers &amp; infant monitor ensure safety intervention ( assessment undernutrition , micronutrient deficiency index poor nutrition ) . Data collect part routine health care activity analyze base allocation study group ( `` intention treat '' ) . Results present appropriate effect size measure precision ( 95 % confidence interval ) . Further exploratory analysis base participant fully follow protocol ( `` per-protocol analysis '' ) . Expected result : expect intervention benefit participant achieve adequate nutritional status &amp; metabolic control , early , pregnancy well adequate infant growth &amp; development result increase impact standard nutrition health care practice . The result potentially extended rest primary health care system give `` program effectiveness '' approach take . Additionally , expect study serve core project ancillary project nest . Gathered information contribute well understand develop effective intervention halt maternal obesity epidemic associate co-morbidities Chilean population .</detailed_description>
