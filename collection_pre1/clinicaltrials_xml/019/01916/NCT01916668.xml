	<brief_title>A Cross-sectional Study Intradialytic Hypertension Four Haemodialysis Units Western Cape</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Intradialytic hypertension ( IDH ) paradoxical rise blood pressure ( BP ) immediately haemodialysis . Nephrologists yet arrive standard definition IDH . Definitions vary widely systolic blood pressure rise ≥ 10mmHg , rise mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) dialysis &gt; 15mmHg hypertension appear resistant ultrafiltration immediately dialysis.1 Depending definition use , prevalence IDH vary 5-15 % . This phenomenon may appear trivial inexperienced doctor . However , IDH increase risk hospitalization death report Crit-Line Intradialytic Monitoring Benefit Study ( CLIMB ) United States Renal Data System ( USRDS ) haemodialysis study . The pathogenesis IDH unclear . A number factor implicate probably work synergistically promote rise BP . These include : subclinical volume overload , activation sympathetic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system , endothelial dysfunction , sodium gain dialysis , use erythropoietin stimulate agent ( ESAs ) removal anti-hypertensive agent dialysis . The management IDH rely heavily control sodium fluid dynamic . There randomize control study guide management . Objectives Primary : Determine prevalence IDH four haemodialysis unit Western Cape Secondary : To examine association IDH follow potential risk factor : Intradialytic weight gain , presence and/or degree fluid overload assess bioimpedance monitoring , quantity time anti-hypertensive drug , ESA dose route administration , time-averaged sodium concentration , dialysate calcium concentration haemodialysis modality . Methods Study Design A multicentre , cross-sectional study chronic haemodialysis patient four adult dialysis unit Western Cape conducted.IDH define rise ≥10mmHg systolic blood pressure pre- post-dialysis least 4 six dialysis session . Patients screen eligible inclusion study identify haemodialysis chart primary investigator ( PI ) . They approach PI , try obtain informed consent . Once informed consent obtain exclusion criterion present , patient enrol . A study ID number allocate . Using standard operating protocol ( SOP ) , weight , BP , pulse rate , bioimpedance , ultrafiltration rate volume determine , hourly dialysis 30 minute completion dialysis . Timing use antihypertensive drug , ESA use , dialysis modality , intradialytic calcium time average sodium level determine . All data extract captured onto standardise data sheet .</detailed_description>
