	<brief_title>Imetelstat Given Intravenously Alone With Standard 13-Cis-Retinoic Acid Children With Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do imetelstat show slow growth tumour animal may also adults , sure also slow tumour growth child offer good result standard treatment . Laboratory study suggest imetelstat may increase activity 13-cis-retinoic acid , use treat neuroblastoma , although yet prove patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological verification neuroblastoma either original diagnosis relapse . Patients must recurrent refractory neuroblastoma either measurable evaluable disease ( define positive nuclear scan bone scan metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) scan ) . If lesion isolate /or previously irradiate stable , proven positive biopsy require eligible . Current disease state must one know curative therapy therapy proven prolong survival acceptable quality life . Must recover acute effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy radiotherapy prior study entry follow : At least 3 week completion last active cancer therapy recover toxic effect therapy ≤ grade 1 . At least 6 week post hematopoietic stem cell rescue follow myeloablative therapy . At least 3 month must elapse prior total body irradiation , craniospinal XRT ≥ 50 % radiation pelvis . At least 6 week must elapse substantial bone marrow irradiation . At least 6 week prior MIBG therapy . Age &gt; 18 month ≤18 year time study entry . Performance Status : Patients ≤10 year : Lansky ≥50 Patients &gt; 10 year : Karnofsky ≥60 % Laboratory Requirements : ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Adequate Bone Marrow Function , define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.0 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥100 x 10^9/L ( transfusion independent define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day prior registration ) Hemoglobin ≥80 g/L ( may receive RBC transfusion ) Patients know bone marrow metastatic disease eligible study may receive transfusion , provide ≤25 % bone marrow involve , provide know refractory red cell platelet transfusion . Patients eligible long blood count criterion meet . If patient experience prolonged myelosuppression , bone marrow examination request determine low blood count due malignant infiltration marrow therapy induce hypoplasia/aplasia . Adequate Renal And Cardiac Function , define : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit normal age Measured GFR ≥70 mL/min/1.73 m2 Adequate Liver Function , define : AST ALT ≤2.5 x upper limit normal age Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal age Serum albumin ≥ 20 Adequate Coagulation Function , define : • PTT &lt; 1.2 x upper limit normal Patient guardian consent must obtain patient accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . Children &gt; 8 year old whose parent guardian sign consent behalf may also sign assent desire . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : two hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . Patients &gt; 25 % bone marrow involvement enrol . Patients must able take oral medication gastrointestinal abnormality ( e.g . bowel obstruction previous gastric resection ) would lead inadequate absorption 13cisretinoic acid . Known HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Imetelstat animal vitro study suggest genotoxic teratogenic . However , 13cisretinoic acid know teratogenic . Pregnancy test must obtain girl post menarchal . Males female reproductive potential may participate unless agree use two reliable contraceptive method . Pregnant breastfeeding female enter study due potential fetal teratogenic adverse effect . Concurrent Medications : Patients receive investigational agent enrol . Patient receive anticancer agent enrol . Patients CNS metastasis need submit baseline MRI obtain within 21 day prior registration . Patients evidence current prior CNS hemorrhage exclude . Patients opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study enrol .</criteria>
