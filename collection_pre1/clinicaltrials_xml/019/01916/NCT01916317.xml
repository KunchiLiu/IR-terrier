	<brief_summary>Voltage Gated Sodium Channels Over year , evidence ionic channel involve oncogenic process . Among , voltage gate sodium channel ( VGSC ) express non-nervous non-muscular organ often associate metastatic behavior different cancer . Expression VGSCs report vitro and/or vivo range human carcinoma , include breast cancer Ion channel major signal molecule express wide variety tissue . They involve determine variety cellular function like proliferation , solute transport , volume control , enzyme activity , secretion , invasion , gene-expression , excitation-contraction coupling , intercellular communication.4 VGSC activity contribute much cellular behavior integral metastasis , include cellular process extension , lateral motility galvanotaxis , transverse invasion , secretory membrane activity . A correlation Na transport oncogenesis widely report literature . In 1980 , transform mouse mammary cell show 3-fold high intra-cellular sodium content untransformed cells.5 Additionally evidence suggest increase inward sodium current voltage gate sodium channel increase invasive capacity breast cancer.6 Also , growth proliferation mammary adenocarcinoma cell inhibit Amiloride suggest epithelial Na channel ( ENaC ) activity correlate proliferation breast cancer cell Current evidence suggest VGSC activity necessary sufficient cancer cell invasiveness8 . A recent vitro study show human MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line express functional VGSCs9 . However , molecular nature VGSC functional relevance breast cancer vivo currently study . Surgical operation cancer report induce dissemination cancer cell surround tissue circulation10,11and infiltration anesthetic inhibit immune response12-14 . Although mechanism remain elucidated , infiltration anesthetic lidocaine membrane- stabilize action ( Seeman , 1972 ) agent could direct effect cancer cell . Therefore , important clarify effect infiltration anesthetic behavior tumor cell . Commonly use local anesthetic agent inhibit VGSCs also possess unique membrane stabilize action unknown mechanism . A study Mammota et al 15 report lignocaine , effectively inhibit invasive ability human cancer ( HT1080 , HOS , RPMI-7951 ) cell concentration use surgical operation ( 5-20 mM ) . Lidocaine reduce invasion ability cell partly inhibit shed HB-EGF cell surface modulation intracellular Ca2+ concentration contribute action . In addition , lidocaine ( 5-30 mM ) infiltrate around inoculation site , inhibited pulmonary metastasis murine osteosarcoma ( LM 8 ) cell vivo . Dose lidocaine15 : 40 mM ( 1 % ) lidocaine usually use infiltration anesthesia surgical operation . Lower concentration ( 1-20mM ) lidocaine sufficient suppress invasive ability cancer cells14 . One mM lidocaine inhibit invasive ability HT1080 cell 50 % , 20 mM lidocaine inhibit invasion ability completely . Lidocaine also inhibit dose-dependently invasive ability HOS RPMI-7951 cell , although less effective HOS cell . Lignocaine exert anesthetic action obstruct sodium channel 16 however , 10 mMof tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) , specific sodium channel inhibitor , little effect invasive ability HT1080 cell . Ten mM lidocaine-N-ethylbromide ( NEB ) , cross cell membrane , also little effect invasive ability cell . Objectives Primary Objective : • To assess in-vivo ability local anesthetic agent like lignocaine decrease dissemination cancer cell surgery improve disease free interval Secondary Objective • To assess in-vivo ability local anesthetic agent like lignocaine impact long term survival . Methodology / Treatment plan The study drug ( 0.5 % lidocaine 60mM ) test intraoperative setting prior surgery test randomize setting . : Arm A : 60mM 0.5 % lignocaine inject peritumoral prior excision . The local anesthetic inject 6 surface tumor also within tumor . Wait 7 minute action follow surgery . ( Intervention arm ) Arm B : No injection lignocaine prior excision ( Control arm )</brief_summary>
