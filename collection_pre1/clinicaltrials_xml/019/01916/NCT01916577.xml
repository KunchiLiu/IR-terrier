	<detailed_description>The investigator develop new therapy utilizing stem cell find bone marrow define cell surface expression protein `` cluster differentiation antigen 117 '' ( CD117 ) . Studies utilize stem cell mouse heart transplant model demonstrate significantly improve survival transplant heart , ( much 5 time see untreated heart transplant ) . In vitro study mouse also show cell work inhibit immune system inhibit T cell activation/proliferation paracrine ( primary ) contact-dependent ( less ) mechanism . Importantly , stem cell take intended transplant recipient ( autologous ) since cell part body normally ( small number ) ; cell theoretically without risk patient . This different stem cell therapy , take donor put patient significant risk develop potentially life-threatening immune reaction . Because use stem cell potentially safe - rapid study , development , implementation autologous CD117 stem cell ( SC ) therapy human transplant patient theoretically possible . Therefore , cell high impact potential field tissue organ transplantation well auto-immunity - potentially improve tissue/cellular engraftment , decrease acute rejection , and/or promote organ transplant tolerance ( lack rejection despite concomitant immune-suppression ) . Prior full clinical development ( efficacy trial human ) , next step develop safe efficacious mean obtain relatively large quantity cell potential human recipient . As bone marrow biopsy cell capture without risk ( especially ill potential lung transplant recipient ) , investigator propose use Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) , CXC-chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) -inhibitor cause efflux bone marrow-derived CD117+ cell peripheral blood capture apheresis/positive selection . If successful , next step perform initial safety study human patient await transplantation normal control ( goal initial protocol however ) . These study potential lead large-scale clinical efficacy trial ultimate indication/implementation human disease ( ) . Primary Outcome Measure : The number circulate CD117+ cell per milliliter ( ml ) peripheral blood baseline follow Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment ( change peripheral blood CD117+ cell per ml ) . Secondary Outcome Measures : . ) The number Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) relate adverse event ( AEs ) . ii . ) The number patient Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) relate AEs iii . ) The number Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) relate serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . iv . ) The number patient Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) relate serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . As listed package insert , common adverse reaction ( â‰¥10 % ) hematopoietic stem cell mobilization : diarrhea ( 37 % ) , nausea ( 34 % ) , fatigue ( 27 % ) , injection site reaction ( 34 % ) , headache ( 22 % ) , arthralgia ( 13 % ) , dizziness ( 11 % ) , vomit ( 10 % ) . It note majority occur patient also undergo apheresis . Outcome Measure Time Frame : Primary Outcome Measure Time Frame : At baseline 8 hour post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment Secondary Outcome Measures Time Frame : . ) : Continuously first 30 minute post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , 1 year post treatment . ii . ) : For first 30 minute post administration , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment 1 year post treatment , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , 1 year post treatment . iii . ) : For first 30 minute post administration , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment 1 year post treatment , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , 1 year post treatment . iv . ) : For first 30 minute post administration , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment 1 year post treatment , 1 week post-Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment , 1 year post treatment . Primary Study Goals : To determine whether Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) mobilize CD117+ progenitor cell bone marrow patient chronic lung disease lung transplant wait list ( versus normal control ) . We compare baseline count CD117+ cell cell count 8 hr Plerixafor determine efficacy mobilization . The primary result use determine number round apheresis may require isolate sufficient cell reinfusion later timepoints future study . Significance : If investigator mobilize sufficient number autologous CD117+ cell , eventually re-infuse time transplant determine whether abrogate acute rejection follow human lung transplantation ( future study ) . The investigator believe safe allogeneic stem cell risk graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) autologous cell . Hypothesis : These experiment demonstrate effectiveness CD117+ stem cell mobilization bone marrow peripheral blood ( PB ) via CXCR4 antagonism ( Plerixafor ) whether end-stage lung disease affect ability mobilize stem cell . Additionally , result use mathematically extrapolate approximately many round peripheral blood apheresis require attain adequate stem cell number clinical infusion ( 10e7 ) future study . Methods : Experiments involve take blood consent patient await lung transplantation ( well normal control ) prior Plerixafor ( Mozobil ) treatment ( 240mcg/kg subcutaneously ) 8 hour treatment Table 1 .
