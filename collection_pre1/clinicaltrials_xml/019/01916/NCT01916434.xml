	<detailed_description>Aquaculture potential take pressure wild fish stock whilst meet dietary need population omega 3 fatty acid key nutrient vitamin D. The industry work hard improve sustainability - 1995 2006 estimate input output ratio salmon improve 7.5 4.9 trout 6.0 3.4- need . Reductions fish stock catch quota , addition sustainability consideration , mean farm fish may raise vegetable oil example may reduce omega 3 content may affect content nutrient . Fish important component diet need understand effect pressure sustainability method production health give property fish . We commission Scottish Government 's Rural Environment Science Analytical Services Division ( RESAS ) research health effect Scottish farm fish feed different feed regime Scottish population , assess differential effect measure health outcome could relate fish composition . Consumption fish omega-3- fatty acid fish reduces coronary heart disease mortality , lead cause death develop nation . The precise way fish provide benefit fully understood . This important fish fish oil consist complex mixture fatty acid micronutrient could individually , collectively , responsible beneficial effect . Aquaculture Scotland play increasingly important role provision fish human consumption , issue sustainability require aquaculture replace traditional fish oil meal formulate fish diet oil sustainable source , may affect level beneficial omega-3 fatty acid ( EPA DHA ) component fish . We investigate health effect consume two portion oily fish ( Scottish farm salmon ) per week ( current UK recommendation ) use fish raise different feeding regime . HYPOTHESIS The health effect consume two portion oily fish ( Scottish farm salmon ) per week ( current UK recommendation ) different fish raise different feeding regime , primarily term improve omega-3 index . OBJECTIVE The main objective propose study determine 1 ) whether health benefit consume two portion Scottish farm salmon per week feed diet high fish oil fish meal significantly outweigh health benefit consume two portion Scottish farm salmon per week feed diet sustainable level fish meal fish oil , 2 ) whether difference health benefit could justify use less sustainable dietary regime farm fish .</detailed_description>
