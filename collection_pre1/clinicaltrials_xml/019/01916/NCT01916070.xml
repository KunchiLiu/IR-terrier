	<brief_summary>Patients symptom complex syncope near-syncope quite often emergency department . Most patient syncope positive prognosis . However type syncope associate increased morbidity mortality . It challenge detect patient reliably early stage . The current guideline contain exact definition concern characteristic patient syncope recommendation diagnose treat patient follow standardized pathway . Due fact near-syncope poorly define therefore seldom evaluated clinical trial , data concern near-syncope rare . Our aim characterize patient present syncope near-syncope emergency department regard risk profile , comorbidities prognosis . First evaluate difference two group syncope near-syncope concern type frequency adverse event . Furthermore analyzed routinely measure cardiac biomarkers NT-proBNP h cTnT patient syncope near-syncope . Then determine prognostic accuracy predict adverse event diagnostic accuracy find underlying etiology . Finally analyzed special patient collective , patient age â‰¥ 65 year . It assume elderly patient suffer comorbidities age-related physiological cognitive disability . We therefore hypothesize elderly patient , contrast patient age &lt; 60 , display increase risk adverse event poor prognosis .</brief_summary>
