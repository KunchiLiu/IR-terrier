	<brief_summary>Both single shot femoral nerve block continuous femoral nerve block catheter show effective pain control anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR ) . Continuous femoral nerve block may effective two reduce pain score opioid consumption first 48 hour postoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Continuous Femoral Nerve Block Versus Single Shot Femoral Nerve Block Pain Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number ambulatory procedure steadily increase last decade . Postoperative pain common cause delay discharge unexpected admission ambulatory surgery . Knee surgery identify one procedure associate pain 24 hour , 45 % high incidence moderate severe pain . Poor pain control counteract many benefit ambulatory surgery lead development chronic pain . Regional technique show effective ACL reconstruction , allow faster patient recovery few side-effects intravenous administration opioids . Different regional technique apply studied ACLR . Femoral nerve block ACLR either single bolus continuous infusion markedly decrease intravenous analgesic requirement postoperative pain . To Investigator 's knowledge , study compare two technique ACLR patellar tendon graft allograft .</detailed_description>
