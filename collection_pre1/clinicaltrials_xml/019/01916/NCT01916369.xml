	<brief_summary>The primary objective Phase I ascend dose trial investigate safety tolerability intramuscular ( gastrocnemius ) injection human neural stem cell product , CTX , patient peripheral arterial disease ( Fontaine Stage II IV ) . This trial base independent preclinical data lead academic research institution submit publication . Inclusion patient Fontaine Stage II justify patient low incidence background event facilitate distinction event possibly intervention-related versus spontaneous event associate underlie advanced atherosclerosis . The trial design treat 9-18 patient evaluate safety measure 12 month follow-up period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Trial Of CTX Cells In Patients With Lower Limb Ischaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : The trial multi-centre open label , non-comparative , ascend dose safety study , use CTX cell treat patient low limb ischaemia , follow-up 12 month . Pre-treatment selection patient : Men woman , age &gt; 50 year peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( Fontaine Stage II IV ) one leg , unsuitable surgical re-vascularisation , ankle/brachial pressure index ( ABPI ) &lt; 0.9 toe/brachial index &lt; 0.7 . Women must surgically sterile 2 year past last menstrual period test negative pregnancy . Treatment : One patient treat one time single dose CTX cell . Three ascend dos ( 20 , 50 80 million cell ) , allocate sequentially , test 9-18 patient ( 3 dose cohort 3-6 patient . All trial patient receive 10 intramuscular injection CTX DP gastrocnemius muscle ischaemic leg single occasion . In event legs peripheral arterial disease , injection administer leg determine Investigator advanced/severe disease provide leg already surgical amputation toe . A minimum interval 28 day observe dose first second patient 7 day dose subsequent patient give cohort order ass safety tolerability CTX DP dose . A 3 patient may add cohort ( maximum 18 total treat patient ) discretion Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) require clarify safety profile ) . A minimum interval 28 day observe dose first second patient 7 day dose subsequent patient give cohort order ass safety tolerability CTX DP dose . Post-treatment follow-up : There 8 schedule visit clinic monitoring 12 month follow-up period . End-points : The primary endpoint trial safety , measure number relevant adverse event , health screening , physical examination ( overall treat limb ) , immunological response , amputation concomitant medication first year treatment . Post-trial follow-up : Life-long annual follow-up record new cancer via national cancer registry similar system Investigator family practitioner ( permitted competent authority , ethic committee informed consent ) .</detailed_description>
