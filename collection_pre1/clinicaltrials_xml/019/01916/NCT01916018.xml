	<detailed_description>Congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) rare disease affect 1 3500 newborn . This condition detect consistently since late 1970s France , enable early care significant improvement intellectual stature prognosis child . However neurodevelopmental disorder persist 10-15 % case . More associated pathology report nearly 10 % case . These observation case poorly understood . The family nature HC well accept dozen gene involve . However majority case ( HC due disorder organification iodine ) , mutation find relative number patient ( 5-10 % ) , suggest involvement gene . Some gene implicate specific syndromic form many pathological association remain unexplained . Also , complete elucidation genetic HC enable well understanding etiology thus share risk familial recurrence ( frequently ask parent child question ) secondly presence comorbidities . Main objective : To describe population HC ( due disorder organification iodine ) clinical , biological radiological ( phenotypic analysis ) also genetic level establish genotype / phenotype correlation . Secondary objective : 1. study frequency malformation / pathological association patient HC 2. identify group patient syndromic form early treatment may improve prognosis child 3. search mutation gene know involved pathology 4. search new locus / gene involve 5. determine optimal genetic strategy adopt HC case . Inclusion criterion : - Patient : Newborn ( 0-27 day ) infant ( 28 days-23 month ) , child adult congenital hypothyroidism ( say filter paper TSH &gt; 15 mU / ml / serum TSH &gt; 10 mU / ml ) diagnose first month life , regardless age , sex , weight size . Subjects blood level free thyroid hormone ( FT3 FT4 ) standard describe subclinical hypothyroidism . If treatment L-thyroxine stop without relapse ( say , always TSH &lt; 5 mU / ml different control ) , hypothyroidism call transient , whatever age discontinuation . - No early neonatal goitre palpation ultrasound examination - negative perchlorate test ( ie rate iodine salt &lt; 10 % 2 hour injection perchlorate ) thyroid gland place - No self-immunity thyroid child / mother ( defined antithyroperoxidase presence antibody / thyroglobulin ) - Signature free informed consent patient legal representative - Affiliate enjoy social security system Non-inclusion criterion : - Presence antithyroid autoimmunity child / mother marker ( antithyroperoxidase presence antibody / thyroglobulin ) - Goiter neonatal palpation ultrasound examination - positive perchlorate test ( ie . decrease rate iodine &gt; 10 % 2 injection perchlorate ) Exclusion criterion : Patients foreign origin return country exclude study , even lose follow refuse perform additional test request . - Acts / medical examination carry take care usually within scope search do care : - Ultrasound thyroid - Thyroid scintigraphy - Data thyroid function : minimum value FT3 , FT4 TSH plasma last blood test current treatment ( dose L-T4 ) - Data current education ( occupation ) level psychomotor development establish scale Denver - Data associate disease : echocardiography / existence heart disease kidney / ultrasound existence renal disease - Clinical examination perform clinician investigator geneticist center . - Standard karyotype - Specific Genetic Analysis : TTF1/Nkx2.1 ; FOXE/TTF2 ; PAX8 , TSHR Nkx2.5 blood sample patient ( 10 ml EDTA blood ) - Search new gene 1. case consanguineous family , genome-wide study look homozygous region share affected member ( homozygosity map autozygotie mapping ) . ( relate first degree blood sample 10 mL EDTA ) 2. patient one disease associate HC , seek number variation ( CNV ) gene locus . If abnormality find patient , blood sample two parent 10 ml EDTA search CNV variation exclude inherit CNVs . 350 patient HC follow endocrinologist / French pediatrician . Note majority patient identify database 10 year INSERM U845 ( Necker Hospital , Paris ) . Planned duration test : 42 month Time inclusion : 18 month Duration follow-up : 2 year The patient may contact agreement time perform additional test require / new blood sample genetic study . Multinational cross-sectional study In first period , accurately describe patient phenotypically 2nd period , find genetic cause . This facilitated presence DNA already collect majority one national bank France , establish laboratory research center U845 ( biocollection DC-2008-596 , Faculty Necker , Paris ) Primary endpoint : - Etiological type congenital hypothyroidism : athyrose , ectopia , hemiagnÃ©sie , hypoplastic gland place normal shape size - Presence type cytogenetic abnormality / genetically presence type pathology associate HC - Presence neuropsychological abnormality ( include delay psychomotor development ) Secondary endpoint : Will consider chapter element cause psychomotor retardation ( 3 ) : - Time management hypothyroidism - Optimization treatment hypothyroidism : delay normalization TSH T4 , number TSH &gt; 15 mU / ml follow-up , adherence - The presence early complication / neonatal Statistical analysis include follow main chapter : - Description population ( anamnestic data , clinical , hormonal status diagnosis follow-up imaging data ) . - Analysis determinant psychomotor development ( see criterion secondary outcome ) . - Data genetic study ( type mutate gene nature mutation genetic location deletion duplication ) An analysis observe association mutation phenotypes patient perform method comparison genotype frequency different group subject ( chi-square test Pearson 2 necessary Fisher exact test ) . The hazard ratio associate risk occurrence event estimate confidence interval 95 % . Comparisons event different mutation test use log-rank test . All test bilateral value p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . After 42 month , study identify responsible gene large proportion patient congenital hypothyroidism ( exclude disorder organification iodine ) , establish genotype-phenotype correlation propose early genetic screening ( systematic newborn screen ) patient family . The study frequency associate disease genetic elucidation also provide recommendation early treatment ( possibly `` preventive '' ) later predictable potentially negative repercussion associate hypothyroidism</detailed_description>
