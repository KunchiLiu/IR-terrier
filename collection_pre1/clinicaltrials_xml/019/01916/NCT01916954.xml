	<brief_summary>Malaria pregnancy major cause maternal newborn morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa ] . Effective antimalarial preventive treatment regimens significantly reduce malaria-related morbidity mortality mother baby . However , therapeutic choice limit concern possible toxicity fetus concern pregnant woman normally exclude clinical trial . This , combine lack adverse event report system , result scarcity data drug safety efficacy pregnancy . Moreover , change maternal physiology pregnancy often alter pharmacokinetic drug . Artemether-lumefantrine ( ALN ) highly efficacious artemisinin-based combination therapy approve World Health Organisation use 2nd 3rd trimester , although still infrequently used pregnancy uncertainty optimum dose . The pharmacokinetics ALN alter pregnancy , result reduce plasma concentration standard adult dose still effective high transmission setting , pregnant woman high level immunity , efficacy reduce significantly low transmission setting woman low level immunity . Inadequate antimalarial treatment dose pregnancy risk treatment failure breakthrough infection exposure malaria parasites sub-therapeutic drug concentration thus select drug resistance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Regimens Artemether-lumefantrine Treatment Malaria Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim current trial compare standard 3-day regimen artemether-lumefantrine 5-day regimen artemether-lumefantrine group pregnant woman control non-pregnant woman uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . The pharmacokinetics lumefantrine modify pregnancy standard regimen use treatment adult might sufficient cure malaria , therefore expose pregnant woman sub-therapeutic drug level increase risk clinical failure . Previous pharmacokinetic study show standard 3-day treatment pregnancy result reduce plasma concentration artemether , dihydroartemisinin lumefantrine faster elimination lumefantrine . Low lumefantrine plasma concentration day 7 associate therapeutic failure . Population-based simulation suggest increase dose treatment duration need adequate drug exposure patient . We propose assess pharmacokinetics longer regimen artemether-lumefantrine , ( 10 dos artemether-lumefantrine five day ) compare standard regimen , ( 6 dos artemether-lumefantrine three day ) small group pregnant African woman uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . The long regimen ensure curative plasma concentration lumefantrine reach , unlikely result increase frequency adverse event .</detailed_description>
