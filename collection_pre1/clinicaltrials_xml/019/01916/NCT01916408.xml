	<brief_summary>The aim present study investigate change inflammatory status incidence infection extreme aerobic physical stress ( participation marathon ) . In addition , impact marathon run hemostasis muscular state evaluate . Changes inflammatory , muscular , rheological level relate ingestion oral hydrolytic enzyme bioflavonoids .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Enzymes Flavonoids Inflammation Coagulation After Marathon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The influence extreme physical stress , experience marathon competition , inflammatory system coagulation investigate . However , , countermeasures adverse effect adequately identify . Immune-modulators ( e.g . flavonoid ) know present fruit vegetable . There also several different proteolytic hydrolytic enzyme find fruit attribute protective property . Therefore , 160 train untrained runner consume mixture different enzyme flavonoid ( Wobenzym Plus® ) PL 1 ( placebo ) effect change inflammation hemostasiologic parameter investigate extreme physical stress ( participation marathon race ) . The clinical result perturbation immune system assess Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey ( WURSS-24 ) regard symptom upper respiratory tract system . It hypothesize intake product immunomodulatory potential ( Wobenzym Plus ® , consist hydrolytic enzyme flavonoid ) positively influence inflammation blood coagulation pertubations observe marathon race .</detailed_description>
