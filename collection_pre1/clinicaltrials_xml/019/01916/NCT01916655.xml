	<brief_summary>OSA major chronic condition affect quality life million Americans . Per Institute Medicine new treatment adherence strategy need help improve quality care , reduce social economic cost , help chronic condition ( OSA ) live healthy productive life well management condition . Using mHealth tool help deliver investigator ' Self-Management intervention improve frequency quality patient-provider communication central component discovery process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Frequency Quality Sleep Apnea Care Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective proposal evaluate new mobile health ( mHealth ) system patient Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome ( OSA ) facilitate patient-centered , collaborative management patient prescribe first-line treatment , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . CPAP adherence rate disappointingly low . The mHealth system propose use study inform group 's previous interventional effort , include interactive website intervention OSA patient prescribe CPAP . Limitations intervention include use immobile desktop computer website access base previously evaluate protocol . The advantage propose mHealth system use mobile device allow increase patient-provider communication incorporation Sleep Apnea Self-Management Program protocol . The evaluative aspect proposal design randomize , control clinical trial-Usual Care ( control ; UC ) ; Self-Management Care ( intervention 1 ; SM ) ; Self-Management via mHealth ( intervention 2 ; SM-Mobile ) . The key feature SM-Mobile intervention use mHealth tool allow provision Self-Management Program utilization audio/visual conferencing , self-monitoring , treatment track patient remotely ( i.e. , non-clinic environment ) . The overarch aim present project examine effect patient-centered , collaborative care intervention improve quality care , increase CPAP adherence clinically meaningful level . The central question encompass conceptual empirical contour study : Does SM-Mobile intervention effect patient 's experience care , CPAP adherence , OSA outcomes relative Usual Care Self-Management Care ? To answer research question , process address fundamental intervention efficacy cost issue telemedicine , propose randomize , control trial aim specifically achieve follow goal : This project follow specific aim : Aim 1 : To examine effect Self-Management Care deliver mHealth ( SM-Mobile ) intervention compare Usual Care ( SM ) Self-Management Care ( SM ) level CPAP adherence . The hypothesis participant SM-Mobile group exhibit high level CPAP adherence compare UC SM group 2-month intervention period . Aim 2 : To examine effect SM-Mobile intervention , compare Usual Care Self-Management Care , patient 's experience quality patient-centered , collaborative care ( measure Patient Assessment Chronic Illness Care CAHPS Clinician &amp; Group Survey ) . The hypothesis participant SM-Mobile group experience great improvement patient-centered , collaborative care compare UC SM group 2-month follow-up period . Aim 3 : To examine effect SM-Mobile , compare UC SM , OSA apnea outcome ( e.g. , OSA symptoms OSA-specific health-related quality life [ HRQOL ] ) . The hypothesis participant SM-Mobile group experience great improvement self-reported OSA symptom HRQOL baseline compare UC SM 2-month follow-up period . Aim 4 : To perform basic cost analysis SM-Mobile intervention compare Usual Care , apply micro-cost methodology measure quantity input use production care unit cost . This test null hypothesis significant cost difference group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The project 4year timeline . Patients provider VA Pulmonary Sleep Clinic participate prospective randomize clinical trial . Patients participate complete write informed consent , agree randomize , complete baseline assessment , participate study interventional protocol , complete followup assessment oneyear postintervention . The intent recruit study population fairly representative overall VASDHS population patient diagnose OSA . To end , inclusion criterion design inclusive possible operationalized follow : age &gt; 18 year ; confirm diagnosis OSA ; newly prescribe CPAP therapy ; chronic symptom note screen symptom checklist . OSA diagnosis Sleep Clinic currently consistent publish consensus statements49 CPAP treatment indicate apneahypopnea index ( AHI , number apnea + hypopnea per hour sleep ) either ( 1 ) great equal 15 , ( 2 ) 5 15 AND accompany document sleep apnea symptom , include excessive daytime sleepiness , impaired cognition , mood disorder , insomnia , document cardiovascular disease . Because mild OSA symptom best modestly correlate AHI , research study focus patient moderate severe sleep apnea , therefore inclusion criterion require AHI &gt; 15 . Exclusion criterion include cognitive impairment sufficient cause inability complete protocol ( MMSE &lt; 24/30 ) ; residence geographical area outside San Diego County ( could make necessary facetoface contact difficult ) ; fatal comorbidity ( life expectancy le 6 month indicate treat physician ) ; significant document substance/chemical abuse ; participant circumstance , opinion consensus study team , would interfere safety prospective participant need treatment ( i.e. , clinical need patient outweighs need research study ) . No exclusion criterion study design element use directly indirectly restrict study participation woman , member minority group , primary language . Because men great risk OSA ( identify diagnose great rate ) woman , anticipate final sample reflect OSA base rate difference sex . Some minority group think high OSA prevalence rate Caucasians , assume screened/diagnosed rate Caucasians , expect minority group include study level reflect rate .</criteria>
