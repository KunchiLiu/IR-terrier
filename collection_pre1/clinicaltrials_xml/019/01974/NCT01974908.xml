	<brief_summary>This study involve record electrical signal inside heart ablation procedure . It think study electrical signal detail investigator may able good identify treat patient risk Ventricular Tachycardia ( VT ) . VT low chamber ( ventricle ) heart beat fast condition life-threatening . An ablation procedure perform patient VT despite best treatment available tablet . Cardiac ablation involve interrupt abnormal electrical signal , cause VT , apply type electrical energy catheter . An important part ablation procedure identification exact part heart muscle responsible cause VT . This typically involve sample electrical signal lot different area heart , allow construction computer generate 3 dimensional picture structure electrical circuit inside ventricle . Recent research identify new method interpret electrical signal ( call Fibrillatory Factor - FF ) , may allow good identification area within ventricle ablate . A standard VT ablation often involve u control heart-beat pace heart 1 investigator catheter within heart . The electrical response pace different heart rate often provide doctor information help ablation . This study involve additional period pace different heart rate , electrical response measure different area around ventricle . This allow u calculate area ventricle , investigator new measure FF would predict source VT . In future may allow u good identify patient risk VT , good locate area need ablate .</brief_summary>
