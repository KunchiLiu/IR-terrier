	<brief_summary>Early change associate development smoking-induced disease , e.g. , COPD lung cancer ( two commonest cause death U.S. ) often characterize abnormal airway epithelial differentiation . Airway basal cell ( BC ) stem/progenitor cell necessary generation differentiate airway epithelium . Based preliminary observation epidermal growth factor receptor , know regulate airway epithelial differentiation , enrich BC ligand EGF induce smoking , hypothesize smoking-induced EGF alters ability BC form normally differentiate airway epithelium . To test , airway BC purify use cell-culture method establish laboratory response EGF analyze use genome-wide microarrays vitro air-liquid interface model airway epithelial differentiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Airway epithelium compose 4 major cell type , include ciliated cell , secretory cell , undifferentiated columnar cell , basal cell ( BC ) . The early change associate development smoking-induced lung disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lung cancer , occur airway epithelium , include BC hyperplasia , squamous metaplasia , mucous cell hyperplasia metaplasia , impair ciliated cell structure function , loss Clara cell , increase epithelial permeability due impair junctional barrier . We hypothesize fundamental change smoking-induced derangement BC , stem/progenitor cell population self-renew differentiate ciliated secretory cell . Using technology establish laboratory culture pure population BC human airway epithelium , induce differentiation BC air-liquid interface , assess transcriptome purify BC compare complete differentiate airway epithelium , preliminary data indicates : ( 1 ) airway BC exhibit distinct gene expression signature relevant stem/progenitor cell function , include high expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ; ( 2 ) airway BC healthy smoker different gene expression pattern compare nonsmoker , enrichment functional category relate cell cycle proliferation down-regulation differentiation-associated gene ; ( 3 ) constitutive EGF expression BC differentiate cell barely detectable , smoke selectively up-regulates EGF expression differentiate cell airway epithelium vivo . Based data knowledge EGFR signal plays central role regulation cell proliferation differentiation airway epithelium , central concept proposal smoking-induced expression differentiate cell activate BC via EGFR alter molecular phenotype airway BC impair ability generate normal differentiate airway epithelium . To assess concept , follow aim address : Aim 1 . To determine whether stimulation airway BC healthy nonsmoker EGF induces gene pathway relate smoking-associated phenotype , e.g . BC hyperplasia , squamous metaplasia , mucous metaplasia , abnormal cilium , decrease Clara cell number compromise junctional integrity . Aim 2 . To test hypothesis stimulation airway BC healthy nonsmoker EGF alters BC differentiation air-liquid interface culture , generation smoking-associated phenotype ( see Aim 1 ) . Aim 3 . To test hypothesis upon apical exposure cigarette smoke extract , differentiate airway epithelial cell derive BC healthy nonsmoker release increased amount EGF apical supernatant , alter ability BC healthy nonsmoker generate normal differentiate airway epithelium , block EGF supernatant abolish effect .</detailed_description>
