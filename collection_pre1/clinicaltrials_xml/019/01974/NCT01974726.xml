	<brief_summary>The aim study determine many Eustachian tube function test ( combination test ) helpful find cause ear problem child adult patient middle-ear disease think due poor Eustachian tube function . The Eustachian tube biological tube connects middle ear back nose throat . When Eustachian tube work normally , open close help keep pressure middle ear room air-pressure ( atmospheric pressure ) . When Eustachian tube work well , pressure middle ear increase decrease feel like blocked ear cause ear pain . Poor Eustachian tube function associate distress middle-ear symptom , predispose middle-ear problem condition rapidly change air pressure occur airflight diving , cause certain middle-ear disease otitis medium effusion . It also know result commonly use Eustachian tube function test adults child various middle-ear disease poorer compare child adult without middle-ear disease . However , know difference test result group without disease mean test provide information useful management individual patient disease due Eustachian tube function . To useful clinically , test ( ) accurately identify patient level poor Eustachian tube function sufficient cause middle-ear symptom sign and/or cause middle-ear disease need . To useful , test able diagnose cause observe Eustachian tube problem treatment problem could begin . The investigator would also want test could predict whether ear disease resolve ( without ) treatment whether certain surgical procedure middle-ear problem successful . Here , number Eustachian tube function test use diagnose characterize cause Eustachian tube dysfunction child adult present research clinic suspect poor Eustachian tube function and/or recent history middle-ear disease cause poor Eustachian tube function . After test , medical record periodically review 2 year study participant contact phone obtain information middle-ear disease , response disease treatment success/failure surgical procedure use fix middle-ear problem . Because study focus evaluate potential usefulness Eustachian tube function test diagnosis Eustachian tube dysfunction , present , cause , specific treatment surgical intervention include study recommend investigator . These decision leave subject-patient consultation doctor . To evaluate Eustachian function test , control group healthy adult without history middle-ear problem undergo test two separate session ; subject follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective develop clinical utility panel new exist Eustachian Tube Function ( ETF ) test respect diagnose ET dysfunction cause , recommend specific targeted intervention re-establish normal function predict future course disease attributable dysfunction . In Protocol , investigator open research center clinical evaluation physician self-referred child adult suspect ET dysfunction ( ETD ) and/or diseases attributable dysfunction , perform broad panel ETF test diagnose presence/absence cause dysfunction collect patient record information future disease course subject begin develop comprehensive database relevant clinical utility various test . An adult control group consist healthy volunteer without history significant middle-ear disease also enter . ETF evaluate highly heterogeneous population use pressure-chamber protocol ( ET stress test ) , panel test relevant status tympanic membrane , old subject ( 10 year old , young tolerate ) , endoscopic assessment nasopharyngeal pathology . The goal study define least costly panel test procedure sensitive , specific accurate diagnosis ETD , identification cause dysfunction observe , prediction success rate medical surgical intervention ( e.g . new ET surgical procedure , adenoidectomy , myringoplasty ) prediction future disease course ( probability spontaneous resolution ) . These result interpret term whether ETF test practical value clinicians decision-making related ETD , otitis medium effusion ( OME ) chronic OME ( COME ) relatively portable , inexpensive test system list property introduce typical physician 's practice . All entered patients/subjects history middle-ear disease initial history take focus predispose factor ETD OME ( e.g . atopy , recent frequent cold , gastroesophageal reflux disease , etc . ) symptoms sign associate initial presentation condition . A standard clinical ear , nose throat ( ENT ) examination pneumatic otoscopy tympanometry ( possible ) do . Subjects extant middle-ear ( ME ) effusion otorrhea tube sign symptom cold allergic rhinitis test , may study late time upon resolution condition . Patients contraindication plan test panel triaged one two standard ETF test panel use laboratory , 1 ) Maneuver Sequence , sonotubometry , tubomanometry , Forced-Response test , Inflation-Deflation test ET stress test present tympanic membrane perforation/ventilation tube , 2 ) Maneuver Sequence , sonotubometry , tubomanometry , 9-step test ET stress test present intact tympanic membrane . The investigator begin test capture global assessment ETF respect : muscle-assisted ET opening efficiency measure ME pressure-regulation patency ET measure protective function ET ( patulous , semi-patulous , obstruct ) . For subject age 10 year old young subject sufficiently cooperative , investigator perform nasoendoscopic evaluation nasopharynx ET orifice rest swallowing , speech maneuver determine detectable extrinsic cause ETD . A summary diagnosis presence/absence type cause ETD ( ) prepare study physician , , refer patient , submit refer physician , self-presenting , subject 's Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) . Every 6 month 2 year , subject parent ( minor ) contact update medical history , subject 's medical chart request review year 2 year update Center 's database respect subject 's disease course outcome surgeries treatment . The adult control subject undergo similar ET function test affected group nasoendoscopic evaluation . These repeat one test session least 1 week first test follow-up subject . Using control data parallel study , control subject protocol subject ' history respect ME complaint , evaluation ETF , feedback subject review medical record , investigator expect develop algorithm prescribes specific test sequence optimize diagnosis type cause ETD treatment recommendation give patient present specific history set ETD sign and/or symptom . The investigator also expect establish , reasonable certainty , whether result test clinically useful otolaryngologist general practitioner decision-making respect prescribe treatment and/or surgical intervention affect patient . For test panel test , investigator define sensitivity , specificity accuracy respect various outcome .</detailed_description>
