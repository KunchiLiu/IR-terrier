	<brief_summary>The obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) among threaten health crisis 21st century . Currently , estimate 205 million people T2DM worldwide . Chile similar magnitude problem prevalence diabetes increase 6.3 % 2003 9.4 % 2010 . T2DM complex disease characterize hyperglycemia , insulin resistance relative β-cell failure . Well-known study treatment T2DM ( ADVANCE trial ) show intensive medical treatment significantly reduce complication diabetes . On hand , le 40 % patient T2DM achieve metabolic control diabetes , despite medical treatment . Recently , bariatric surgery emerge effective treatment T2DM . Data different source show Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass ( RYGB ) place T2DM remission . More recently , Sleeve Gastrectomy ( SG ) show also impact metabolically hence also emerge attractive T2DM-controlling bariatric procedure few complication RYGB . Recently , International Federation Diabetes support use gastrointestinal surgery initially develop morbid obesity option treat patient diabetes . In current proposal investigator aim address several issue concern metabolic surgery ability common bariatric procedure perform control diabetes . The investigator propose prospective randomize trial compare RYGB , SG best medical treatment avail T2DM poorly control patient primary endpoint 36 month glycemic control ( patient achieve HbA1C &lt; 6.5 % , normal glucose level require medication ) . The main working hypothesis RYGB SG achieve good glycemic control best treatment avail T2DM base effective mechanism enhance insulin secretion , insulin sensitivity , lipid metabolism blood pressure control . The goal , 1 ) Is gastric bypass surgery sleeve gastrectomy safe microvascular complication T2DM ? ; 2 ) Can gastric bypass , sleeve gastrectomy surgery intensive non surgical treatment reverse reduce progression microvascular complication T2DM ? ; 3 ) Can gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy realize return investment within 2 year patient type 2 diabetes risk develop deteriorate microvascular complication ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently 205 million patient world suffer Type 2 diabetes severe complex obesity . The obesity define body mass index 30 kg/m2 life limb threaten co‐morbidities . The bariatric surgery increase worldwide , effect microvascular complication T2DM never focus randomise controlled clinical trial . To address research question three arm randomise controlled clinical trial compare gastric bypass surgery , sleeve gastrectomy modern best medical care require investigate difference long term glycaemia microvascular complication T2DM . This prospective intervention study patient T2DM obesity undergo gastric bypass surgery , sleeve gastrectomy non surgical best medical care . Patients T2DM 2 year high risk develop kidney damage . Patients recruit specialist medical surgical clinic . We expect screen approximately 300 patient allow 75 randomize . Twenty five subject kidney damage high risk kidney damage secondary T2DM undergo gastric bypass surgery . Another 25 sleeve gastrectomy final 25 treat use American Diabetes Association protocol . Patients HbA1c ≥9.0 % undergo individualise optimisation glycaemia improve surgical outcome . Particular attention give avoidance hypoglycaemia . Patients ' risk factor ( include hypertension dyslipidaemia ) optimise base International Diabetes Federation guideline . The clinical endpoint assess : renal function , peripheral autonomic nervous system function , retina , direct healthcare cost , glycaemic control , blood pressure , lipid , quality life , postprandial response , treatment complication .</detailed_description>
