	<brief_summary>Objective : The goal protocol improve understand scale-free brain activity conscious vs. unconscious process perform small behavioral , electrophysiological , neuroimaging brain stimulation pilot substudies . This research expect help develop technique hypotheses future research topic . We conduct : - Pilot Substudy : Pilot substudies exploratory nature , order develop enough information generate hypothesis . The criterion transition new full protocol acquisition sufficient information generate power analysis . There enrollment limitation pilot substudies . - Hypothesis-Testing Substudy define study specific hypothesis test complete healthy volunteer patient . Hypothesis-testing substudies undergo statistical PIRC review 6 subject ( one group ) 12 ( 6 per arm ) two group study additional subject recruit . In event subject dropout unsuccessful recording , replacement recruit . Together , P.I . PIRC decide whether continue hypothesis substudy subject without amendment whether amendment new protocol would necessary . A memo request review hypothesis-testing substudies possible additional enrollment send PIRC statistical reviewer . The memo forward CNS IRB . - Technical development new experimental paradigm data analysis method . This protocol include non-invasive technique minimal risk ( MRI , EEG , MEG , EMG , tDCS ) . Study Population : We plan recruit 120 healthy volunteer age 18-65 . Design : We design small project pertinent theme scale-free brain activity conscious/unconscious processing . We investigate healthy volunteer rest state perform simple motor sensory task . If hypothesis test substudy lead result interest large population necessary reach statistical significance , separate protocol submit priori hypothesis , specific study design power analysis adapt pilot exploratory substudies perform present protocol . In substudies , brain activity healthy human volunteer monitor functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , electroencephalography ( EEG ) , simultaneous MEG-EEG . Anatomical MRI collect subject allow good localization brain dynamic . Because transcranial direct-current stimulation ( tDCS ) ideally suit modulate slow component scale-free brain activity , also investigate effect tDCS brain activity and/or behavioral performance cognitive task . tDCS administer sequentially , simultaneously , brain-activity monitoring fMRI/MEG/EEG . Most experiment conduct conjunction cognitive task . In experiment , study resting-state brain function , spontaneous brain activity collect without specific externally administer task . Outcome Measures : MRI : analyze measure anatomical structure brain ( use structural MRI ) ; amplitude blood-oxygenation-level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal ( use fMRI ) ; cerebral blood flow [ use arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) ] different neurotransmitter level brain region interest [ use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) ] . EEG MEG : quantify measure power spectrum , event- task-related potential , synchronization/desynchronization , coherence sensor source locate close brain area interest . tDCS : analyze change behavioral measure and/or fMRI/EEG/MEG activity cause tDCS . Behavioral measure : quantify measure hit rate , reaction time , electromyography ( EMG ) pattern . We may measure autonomic data course experiment ( heart rate , respiration , end-tidal CO2 , skin conductance ) , correlate outcome measure .</brief_summary>
