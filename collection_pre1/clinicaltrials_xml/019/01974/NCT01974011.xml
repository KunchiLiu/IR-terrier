	<brief_summary>Dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) regional nerve block probably often perform throughout world . There several different method describe literature . When compare penile ring wall infiltration caudal block , Dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) likely associate risk failure block quality . The aim study compare quality standard method Dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) ( Dalens ' technique ) modify procedure ( Dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) additional infiltration ventromedial penis transition penis scrotum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DPNB v . Modified DPNB With Ventromedial Infiltration ( DPNB According Dalens ' Technique )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male circumcision often perform operation male child throughout world . In western world accept perform procedure without adequate analgesic support . Hence dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) , first describe 70ies 20th century , one frequently perform regional anesthetic procedure child adult . There several method describe literature , one described Dalens et al 1989 nowadays often quote frequently perform method . The reported rate insufficient analgesia DPNB high caudal block penile ring wall infiltration . It known neuroanatomic study , penis innervate mostly , dorsal penile nerve , final branch pudendal nerve . A varying amount ventral penile skin , especially preputium frenulum , innervate fine end branch perineal nerve , otherwise give sensoric innervation scrotum motor innervation bulbospongiosus muscle . An injection local anesthetic underneath Buck 's fascia unable reach perineal nerve , may explanation failure . In study compare two different technique perform dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) : technique accord Dalens , modification , small amount local anesthetic dorsal penile nerve block ( DPNB ) withheld , inject subcutaneously ventral transition penis scrotum midline . The latter injection site perineal innervation relic penile ring wall infiltration , surely block skin fibre dorsal penile nerve perineal nerve . All patient include randomly receive either two injection dorsum penis accord Dalens ' technique , two injection dorsum penis accord Dalens ' technique plus subcutaneous injection ventral midline penis transition penis scrotum . The amount local anesthetic ( bupivacaine 0,75 % , 0,2 ml/kg body weight ) dose narcotic ( Sevoflurane 2,2 Vol % end-expiratory gas oxygen-air mixture ) group .</detailed_description>
