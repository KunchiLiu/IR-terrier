	<brief_summary>Modern therapy patient B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) base intensive administration multiple drug . In patient relapsed disease , treatment response generally poor ; patient , particularly relapse still receive frontline therapy , therapeutic option hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . There proven curative therapy patient relapse transplant . Natural killer ( NK ) cell powerful anti-leukemia activity . In patient undergo allogeneic HSCT , several study demonstrate NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity . NK cell infusion patient leukemia show well tolerate void graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) effect . NK cell cytotoxicity powerful acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell , whereas capacity lyse ALL cell generally low . We develop novel method expand redirect NK cell towards CD19 , molecule highly express surface B-lineage ALL cell express normal cell B-lymphocytes . In method , donor NK cell first expand co-culture cell line K562-mb15-41BBL interleukin ( IL ) -2 . Then , expand NK cell transduce signal receptor bind CD19 ( anti-CD19-BB-zeta ) . NK cell express receptor show powerful anti-leukemic activity CD19+ ALL cell vitro animal model leukemia . This study assess feasibility , safety efficacy infuse expand , activate redirect NK cell research participant B-lineage ALL persistent disease intensive chemotherapy . In cohort , study vivo lifespan phenotype redirect NK cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 . Rationale In contrast well-established cytotoxicity NK cell AML cell , capacity lyse ALL cell generally low difficult predict . We seek overcome intrinsic resistance transduce CD56+ CD3─ NK cell chimeric receptor direct CD19 , molecule widely express malignant B cell . Expression anti-CD19 receptor link CD3zeta overcame NK resistance markedly enhance NK cell-mediated kill leukemic cell . This result significantly improve add 4-1BB costimulatory molecule chimeric anti-CD19-CD3zeta receptor : cytotoxicity produce NK cell express construct uniformly exceed NK cell whose signal receptor lack 4-1BB , even natural cytotoxicity apparent ( Imai et al. , Blood 2005 ) . NK cell express anti-CD19 receptor also exert vigorous anti-ALL activity murine model leukemia ( Shimasaki et al. , Cytotherapy 2012 ) . Our finding indicate enforce expression signal receptor NK cell might circumvent inhibitory signal , provide novel mean enhance effectiveness anti-ALL NK cell therapy . The great anti-leukemic efficacy genetically modify NK cell show preclinical study , together demonstrate feasibility infuse durable haploidentical NK cell non-HSCT set establish expertise NUH team cell therapy ( center Asia accredit Foundation Accreditation Cellular Therapy , FACT ) , form compel rationale clinical test NK cell . The preparation key reagent ( anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA ) finalize Tissue Engineering &amp; Cell Therapy ( TECT ) Laboratory NUH , GMP-compliant MaxCyte electroporator locate . The feasibility large-scale expansion NK cell demonstrate ( Shimasaki et al . Cytotherapy 2012 ) , feasibility large-scale electroporation validate TECT laboratory . We use flow cytometric MRD technology , determine presence persistent disease , include study patient limited amount residual disease ( &lt; 1 % leukemic lymphoblast among normal bone marrow cell ) . We use MRD method monitor effect treatment infusion . We expect condition regimen much effect leukemic cell count , patient eligible study disease resistant many anti-leukemic drug . Nevertheless , condition regimen may salutary effect , important screen peripheral blood and/or bone marrow presence leukemic blast cell stag procedure , i.e. , , , condition NK cell infusion . The presence leukemic cell closely monitor flow cytometry PCR amplification antigen-receptor gene ( sensitivity either method : 1 leukemic cell 10,000 ) shed light relative effect intervention . 2.0 . Hypothesis Objectives The main hypothesis test study infusion NK cell express anti-CD19-BB-zeta receptor electroporation produce measurable clinical response patient resistant B-lineage ALL . 3.0 . Primary Objectives - To determine feasibility safety redirect NK cell anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor mRNA electroporation clinical setting . - To determine efficacy anti-CD19 redirect NK cell research participant B-lineage ALL persistent disease determine MRD method intensive chemotherapy . 4.0 . Secondary Objectives - To study persistence phenotype redirect NK cell research participant B-lineage ALL residual disease intensive chemotherapy . 5.0 . Endpoints In study , treatment response measure compare MRD level several interval NK cell infusion.Achievement MRD negativity bone marrow , i.e. , &lt; 0.01 % blast flow cytometry PCR , regard complete response . Partial response define ≥ 1 log decrease MRD level , &lt; 1 log decrease MRD level regard response . Based previous study , donor NK cell eliminate case resurgent cellular immunity haploidentical recipient effect transient immunosuppression cause condition regimen cease ( typically within 1 month infusion ) . Conceivably , however , NK cell engraftment may persist long period possible risk prolong pancytopenia owe NK cell kill normal hematopoietic cell . Because possibility , plan HSCT rescue patient receive redirected NK cell infusion . Indeed , patient eligible study , HSCT would treatment intervention regardless whether receive NK cell infusion . Because consideration , potential benefit NK cell therapy outweigh risk patient eligible study , i.e. , patient persistent leukemia proven effective treatment available . Because CD19 universally express B cell include early B cell precursor , normal recipient B cell also target donor NK cell transduce anti-CD19 chimeric receptor . Therefore , transient B-cell lymphopenia hypogammaglobinemia expect . We monitor CD19+ blood cell count measure Ig level month give participant intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) IgG level lower age-specific range . 6.0 . Summary Study Design Peripheral blood cell collect apheresis donor . After ex vivo expansion 10 day coculture irradiate K562-mb15-41BBL cell ( Fujisaki et al , Cancer Res 2009 ; Lapteva et al . Cytotherapy 2012 ) T-cell depletion , haploidentical NK cell electroporated anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA . Before infusion , patient receive immunosuppressive therapy promote temporary engraftment NK cell . After infusion , receive IL-2 support NK cell viability expansion vivo . The effect NK cell infusion determine compare MRD level treatment . Receptor expression electroporation transient typically decline 48 hour become undetectable 96 hour . Because aim NK cell therapy induce durable immunity rapidly reduce tumor cell burden , infused NK cell reject host immune system approximately 2 week infusion , transient nature expression significantly affect anti-tumor potential . Moreover , use strategy , safety concern regard insertional mutagenesis long-term persistence transduce residual T cell apply . In case , minimize number residual T cell final product much possible depleting expand product T cell use CliniMACS device , limit number T cell graft &lt; 0.05 x 10^6/kg .</detailed_description>
