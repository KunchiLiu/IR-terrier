	<brief_summary>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) successfully introduce treatment cellulite last year . The purpose study test follow hypothesis : ( ) cellulite efficiently safely treat use radial extracorporeal shock wave device , Swiss Dolorclast ( Electro Medical Systems S.A. , Nyon , Switzerland ) ; ( ii ) individual clinical outcome cellulite treatment ESWT predict mean patient 's individual cellulite grade baseline , patient 's individual age , body mass index ( BMI ) , weight , and/or height .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gynoid lipodystrophy - good know cellulite - represent common lipodystrophic disease find 85 % post-adolescent woman . Cellulite usually develop particular anatomical area thigh , buttock , abdomen , upper arm become visible classical 'orange peel ' appearance - irregular , dimple skin surface thin epidermis/dermis presence nodular cluster fat cell . It represent cosmetic concern woman , often become major psychological problem impair sport activity , clothing choice , social interaction . The pathophysiology cellulite relate various predispose factor biotype , heredity , race , body weight , age , hormonal change , smoking , genetic predisposition . Four main hypothesis regard etiopathogenesis cellulite emerge last decade : different anatomical conformation subcutaneous tissue woman compare men , change biomechanical property epidermal dermal tissue , excessive hydrophilia extracellular matrix increase interstitious pressure cause edema fatty tissue , alteration microvascular lymphatic circulation result often painful protrusion subcutaneous adipose tissue lower reticular dermis , cause distinctive mattress-like surface irregularity . However , hypotheses mutually conflict consider recent advance understand complex physiopathology adipose organ . For instance , one exclude inflammation also contribute formation cellulite . Nevertheless , various treatment cellulite develop last decade , focus skin tighten radiofrequency laser , improve blood lymphatic circulation use physical treatment pharmacotherapy , treat deep deformity surgical subcision , laser treatment , ultrasound device , liposuction . However , single treatment cellulite completely effective . In recent year , extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) radial shock wave therapy ( RSWT ) introduce safe effective treatment option cellulite . A shock wave acoustic pressure wave produce elastic medium air , water , even solid substance . Shock wave differ sound wave wave front , compression take place , region sudden change stress density . Therapeutic shock wave characterize high positive peak pressure ( usually 10 100 MPa ) , fast initial rise pressure ( le 1 µs ) , diffraction-induced tensile wave ( -10 MPa ) follow positive pressure amplitude , short life cycle approximately 10-20 µs . Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) widely use stone management urology . ESWT RSWT byproducts lithotriptor technology . Since late 1980 's introduce treatment various disease musculoskeletal system plantar fasciopathy , Achilles tendinopathy , medial tibial stress syndrome , great trochanteric pain syndrome , lateral medial epicondylitis , calcify tendonitis shoulder . Shock wave direct indirect effect treat tissue . The direct effect result energy shock wave transfer targeted tissue . The indirect effect result creation cavitation bubble treat tissue . It hypothesize direct indirect effect produce biological response treat tissue . ESWT device share two technical key characteristic ESWL device use stone management , namely electrohydraulic , electromagnetic , piezoelectric generation pressure wave generation focus so-called defocused pressure wave . Radial shock wave generate ballistically , i.e. , accelerate bullet strike applicator , transform kinetic energy bullet radially expand pressure wave . Unaddressed study ESWT/RSWT cellulite carry date whether individual clinical outcome therapy predict mean patient 's cellulite grade baseline , age , body mass index ( BMI ) , weight , height , and/or age . This addressed present study use RSWT . We hypothesize individual clinical outcome RSWT cellulite predict mean patient 's cellulite grade baseline patient 's BMI .</detailed_description>
