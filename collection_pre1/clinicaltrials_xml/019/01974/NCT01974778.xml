	<brief_summary>Brown adipose ( fat ) tissue ( BAT ) type fat tissue find certain small rodent human baby capable extremely high rate energy burning . We know adult human present also able burn energy . In addition increase energy expenditure cold exposure , energy burning also increase consume meal . Animal study show part additional energy consumption contribute BAT . In present study aim examine whether BAT activity increase meal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Role Brown Adipose Tissue Postprandial Thermogenesis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose project measure whether BAT activity ( BAT increase energy burn ) increase response ingestion meal . BAT one two type fat , ( white fat ) , find human mammal . In study aim understand BAT work human . Studies animal show addition cold exposure , BAT also activate ingestion meal , different amount depend meal composition , importantly , total energy content . However limited understand BAT function response meal human . Since BAT function defective obesity , activity function impact diet , find whether single high energy meal compose entirely lipid ( fat ) increase BAT activity . In future finding subsequent study may important implication management obesity relate disease . A total 20 people participate project . Participation involve total 3 visit , include screen visit , 2 experimental visit consumption treatment meal one visit , placebo ( dummy ) randomise order .</detailed_description>
