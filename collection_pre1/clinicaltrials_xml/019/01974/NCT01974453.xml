	<brief_summary>Radiation issue percutaneous coronary intervention important issue operator due long term stochastic risk cancer induction , often under-evaluated . Many factor may associate radiation dose adsorb operator . In particular important position take operator , use dedicate X-ray shield duration procedure . However factor ( operator height angulation radiation tube ) might important effect often under-evaluated . Aim observational study evaluate important determinant radiation dose adsorb operator different coronary procedure ( diagnostic coronary angiography percutaneous coronary intervention ) different vascular access ( right leave transradial approach transfemoral approach ) . All patient underwent percutaneous coronary diagnostic interventional procedure enrol observational study . Each operator equip dedicated dosimeter place left wrist , thorax level outside lead apron head level evaluate radiation dose crystalline . Effective dos deliver patient express dose area product ( DAP ) measure Gycm2 .</brief_summary>
