	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke major cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , 4th cause mortality US . Central COPD pathogenesis `` ciliopathy '' , dysfunction airway ciliated cell mediate transport mucus remove inhaled pathogen . The COPD ciliopathy lead mucus accumulation , impair host defense recurrent infection . Using state-of-the-art platform global metabolite profile unique cohort serum lung biologic sample , deliverable identify metabolome focus biomarkers related airway ciliopathy COPD , use observe metabolic change : ( 1 ) direct mechanistic study define ciliopathy molecular level ; ( 2 ) identify novel target therapeutic intervention COPD ; ( 3 ) identify smoker high risk COPD . Preliminary metabolic data lead first clue - COPD smoker decrease serum citrulline level , consistent deficiency lung nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) activity , thus lung nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency . This , together support data smoking-induced NOS/NO-related ciliopathy , knowledge smoker significant oxidant-related change airway epithelial transcriptome , lead aim , combine metabolomics define cohort , murine human mechanistic study computational / statistical integration . Aim 1 . To carry metabolic profiling bank biologic sample characterize cohort assess hypothesis COPD associate unique metabolome serum lung epithelial lining fluid , subset COPD metabolome link ciliopathy COPD . Aim 2 . To combine metabolic profile vitro study human murine airway epithelium evaluate hypothesis link COPD metabolome ( focus infer NO deficiency ) mechanisms underlie ciliopathy COPD . Aim 3 . Characterize quantify cigarette smoke induce `` redoxome '' lung serum assess role ciliated cell dysfunction . Studies seek identify link smoking , burden oxidant lung epithelium pathogenesis COPD - potentially provide biomarker ( ) predict smoker develop COPD identify new target therapy COPD .</detailed_description>
