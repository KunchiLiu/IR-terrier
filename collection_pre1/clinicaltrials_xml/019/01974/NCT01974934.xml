	<brief_summary>To examine efficacy safety treatment desvenlafaxine vascular depression . Primary efficacy , pertain depressive symptom , assess overall change symptom severity score baseline 12-weeks , measure Geriatric Depression Scale . The primary efficacy measure cognition Montreal Cognitive Assessment analysis change baseline 12-week score . To evaluate effectiveness desvenlafaxine first-line treatment vascular depression sub-group patient experience TIA great 6 week prior baseline . Mean difference baseline 12-week efficacy measure examine within sub-group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Desvenlafaxine Treatment Vascular Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial involve 30 subject ( N=30 ) . The study population define basis broader concept vascular depression , include post stroke depression ( PSD ) . Vascular depression ( VaD ) describe patient age equal great 60 year clinical symptom MDD , evidence deep white matter hyperintensities ( DWMH ) MRI cognitive deficit meet criterion dementia ( base score equal less 21 MMSE 0.5 CDR ) . Upon completion screen assessment subject begin treatment desvenlafaxine . For subject currently prescribe alternate SSRI SNRI , titrate current medication begin desvenlafaxine , accord clinical judgment investigator base proven best practice . All subject begin dose 50 mg desvenlafaxine 4 week active treatment may titrate 100 mg daily . At 8-week visit , individual assess partial-responders , judgment investigator , may titrate 150 mg daily . Personal clinical experience principal investigator show desvenlafaxine safely increase dose 100 mg daily partially responsive patient . The decision titrate base risk benefit analysis , 150 mg show effective limited side effect young patient population . The principal investigator comfortable daily dosage 150mg assess potential side effect . Blood pressure monitor baseline every 4 week evidence increase value likely dose escalation . It estimate 5-15 % 30 patient may require 150 mg desvenlafaxine partial non-responders 100 mg daily . Patients prescribe 150mg desvenlafaxine require downward titration move 100mg/d 7 day , 50mg/d 7 day , follow 50mg every day 7 day discontinuation . Patients prescribe 50mg/d 100mg/d undergo similar downward titration prior study drug discontinuation . A baseline assessment conduct subject , follow assessment week 4 , 8 , close assessment week 12 . Additionally , enrol subject undergo MRI head , unless MRI result within past 6 week make available , confirm presence absence DWMH .</detailed_description>
