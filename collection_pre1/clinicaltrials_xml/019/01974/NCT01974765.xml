	<brief_summary>This Phase II study . The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad enzalutamide patient cancer . All patient enter study closely monitor side-effects . If multiple patient develop significant side effect enzalutamide , study may stop early . Enzalutamide androgen-receptor inhibitor , mean block activity hormone testosterone . In ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer express androgen receptor , block androgen-receptor may possibly slow stop tumor growth . Enzalutamide study woman breast cancer , first study use enzalutamide treatment patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Advanced recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma . Histologic documentation original primary tumor require via pathology report AR expression ≥5 % IHC . In case multiple block available stain perform unstained slide 3 separate block . If ≥ 5 % AR tumor stain see ≥ 1 slide tumor consider AR+ . Patients follow histologic cell type eligible : serous adenocarcinoma , endometrioid adenocarcinoma , mucinous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , clear cell adenocarcinoma , mixed epithelial adenocarcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma , malignant Brenner 's tumor , adenocarcinoma otherwise specify Measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension . Each lesion must ≥10mm measured CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; ≥ 20mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must ≥ 15mm short axis measure CT MRI Patients must one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease Patients may receive , require receive , one two additional cytotoxic regimens management recurrent persistent disease Patients receive one prior cytotoxic regimen ( platinumbased regimen management primary disease ) , must platinumfree interval less 12 month , progress platinumbased therapy , persistent disease platinumbased therapy Patients allow receive , required receive , noncytotoxic therapy ( bevacizumab ) part primary treatment regimen . Patients allow receive , required receive , noncytotoxic therapy management recurrent persistent disease Must ≥ 18 year age Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 % Life expectancy ≥ 12 week Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 14 day prior commencement study treatment Women child bear potential must use effective form contraception study least 6 month completion study treatment Recovery effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy At least 4 week last dose radiation therapy At least 4 week postop major surgical procedure At least 3 week last dose chemotherapy and/or biologic/targeted therapy No prior hormonal therapy treatment cancer within past 21 day Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographic condition would potentially hamper compliance study protocol Prior use participation clinical trial evaluate agent either block androgen synthesis ( e.g . abiraterone acetate , TAK700 , TAK683 , TAK448 ) target AR ( e.g. , bicalutamide , BMS641988 ) ( patient know received placebo study eligible ) Laboratory Test Findings perform within 14 day prior initiation study drug showing : Bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,000/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL Renal function : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Hepatic function : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Resolution acute toxic effect prior therapy NCI CTCAE ( Version 4.0 ) Grade ≤ 1 , exception unresolved Grade 2 neuropathy Grade 2 alopecia , allow Patients must able swallow tablet whole , without crush A history another invasive malignancy ( nonmelanoma skin cancer curatively treat situ carcinoma ) evidence disease within past 3 year Use medication know low seizure threshold within 28 day first dose study drug Known brain metastasis History seizure Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP ≥ 160 mmHg diastolic BP ≥ 95mmHg ) despite medical treatment . Patients history hypertension allow provide blood pressure control antihypertensive treatment . Clinically significant heart disease evidence myocardial infarction arterial thrombotic event within past 6 month , severe unstable angina , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IIIV heart disease cardiac ejection fraction measurement &lt; 50 % baseline Refractory nausea vomiting , requirement parenteral hydration and/or nutrition , drainage gastrostomy tube , malabsorption , external biliary shunt , significant small bowel resection would preclude adequate study drug absorption Anticipated ongoing administration anticancer therapy administer study</criteria>
