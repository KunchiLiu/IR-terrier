	<detailed_description>While epidemiologic data link HIV infection increase risk COPD clear , pathogenesis accelerate development COPD HIV infect smoker understood . We focus SAE central target accelerate development COPD HIV infect smoker , extensive data point SAE initial site lung pathology cigarette smoker small airway major site airflow obstruction COPD . Further , emphysema associate COPD begin alveoli surround SAE , prior development clinical evidence lung disease , SAE smoker exhibit marked disordered biology , include change DNA methylation gene expression , disorder differentiation . Importantly , observe HIV infection `` age '' SAE , exaggerate shorten SAE telomere individual infect HIV compare HIV â€¾ smoker . We propose early event pathogenesis accelerate development COPD smoker HIV infection result premature biologic age small airway epithelium ( SAE ) mediate effect direct HIV infection SAE and/or interaction HIV-infected T cell and/or alveolar macrophage ( AM ) SAE , result disordered biology SAE central pathogenesis COPD . In cigarette smoker HIV+ , one common HIV-associated non-AIDS condition accelerate development chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , disorder associate significant morbidity mortality . Based knowledge COPD smoker start SAE , proposal focus examine hypothesis accelerate development COPD associate HIV infection result , part , interaction HIV directly small airway epithelium infection cellular component immune system , mediator release immune cell evoke premature biologic age small airway epithelium . By identify early event pathogenesis HIV-associated accelerate COPD smoker , aim identify biologic target pharmacologic therapy could address .</detailed_description>
