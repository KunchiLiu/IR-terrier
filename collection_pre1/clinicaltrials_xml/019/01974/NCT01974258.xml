	<criteria>Adult patient &gt; /= 18 year age . Patients histologically confirm , BRAFV600mutant , unresectable , locally advanced metastatic solid malignancy . OR Patients histologically confirm , KRASmutant , Stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma , KRASmutant metastatic nonsmallcell lung carcinoma . OR Patients histologically confirm BRAFV600mutant unresectable Stage IIIC Stage IV metastatic melanoma . Valid MET IHC test result . Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors v1.1 ECOG performance status 0 1 . For BRAFV600mutant cancer : Previously untreated melanoma previously treat melanoma without prior exposure HGF , MET , BRAF , MEK inhibitor therapy BRAFV600mutant solid malignancy melanoma standard therapy exist proven ineffective intolerable consider inappropriate . Patients must prior exposure HGF , MET , BRAF , MEK inhibitor therapy . For KRASmutant cancer : mCRC patient must receive therapeutic regimen include oxaliplatin , irinotecan , 5FU , bevacizumab , determine ineligible treatment . Patients must prior exposure HGF , MET , BRAF , MEK inhibitor therapy . Metastatic NSCLC patient must receive platinumbased doublet chemotherapy determine ineligible regimen . Patients must prior exposure HGF , MET , BRAF , MEK inhibitor therapy . Consent provide tumor tissue biomarker analyse . Life expectancy &gt; /= 12 week . Fully recovery effect major surgery significant traumatic injury within 14 day first dose study treatment . Adequate hematologic end organ function , define clinical laboratory result . Use effective form ( ) contraception define protocol course study least 6 month study drug discontinuation . Palliative radiotherapy experimental therapy within 28 day prior first dose study drug treatment . Major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury 28 day prior first dose study drug treatment end study . History another malignancy previous 5 year , unless cure surgery alone continuously disease free . Exceptions include appropriately treated cervical carcinoma situ , nonmelanoma skin carcinoma , Stage I uterine cancer , localize prostate cancer treat surgically presume cure , malignancy expect curative outcome . Brain metastasis spinal cord compression definitively treat surgery and/or radiation , previously diagnose treated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases spinal cord compression without evidence clinically stable disease 14 day . Note : Patients treat CNS metastasis asymptomatic stable dose corticosteroid 14 day prior Cycle 1 Day 1 eligible . For patient give cobimetinib : Evidence visible retinal pathology consider risk factor neurosensory detachment , retinal vein occlusion , neovascular macular degeneration , condition risk factor retinal vein occlusion . Current history clinically significant cardiac pulmonary dysfunction . Lack recovery Grade 1 good adverse event due investigational agent administer 28 day prior enrollment , except alopecia . Current severe , uncontrolled systemic disease . Inability unwillingness swallow pill . History malabsorption condition would interfere gastrointestinal absorption study drug . History clinically significant liver disease , current alcohol abuse , know infection HIV , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Severe ( Grade 3 ) active infection enrollment , serious underlie medical condition . Required medication know cause edema and/or cardiac failure . Active autoimmune disease . Uncontrolled ascites require weekly , largevolume paracentesis 3 consecutive week prior enrollment .</criteria>
