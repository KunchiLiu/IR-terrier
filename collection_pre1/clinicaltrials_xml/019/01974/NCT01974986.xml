	<brief_summary>Athletes participate multiple training session day increase risk suboptimal hydration heat illness second training session , especially environment hot humid . With exception absolute volume water deliver rehydration beverage , characteristic beverage consume play role recovery completeness rehydration . The amount sodium beverage show primary factor rehydration . Recently , effect carbohydrate concentration beverage report , effect mediate renal system response elevate serum insulin . The purpose study compare sodium carbohydrate effect rehydration recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The effectiveness beverage composition evaluate modify sodium content carbohydrate content beverage . Hypothesis : Completeness rehydration great beverage high sodium concentration . It also hypothesize electrolyte-carbohydrate beverage promote rehydration exceeds consume placebo ( water ) . Using randomized balanced-treatment crossover design , physically trained male ( 18-35 yr ) participate intermittent exercise 85 100 minute three experimental trial variable intensity training heat ( 30 +/-3 C ) follow rehydration-recovery period . Exercise do varying intensity ( intermittent interval ) range 50 % nearly 100 % maximum oxygen uptake ( max VO2 ) determine prior experimental trial . During 85 100 min exercise , fluid give trial elicit acute reduction body mass approximately 2.5 3 % ( standardized subject ) . Following exercise , 100 % volume fluid lose replace one beverage . Beverages ingest six aliquot 1-hr period give end trial . Retention fluid calculate measuring volume urine lose 30 , 60 , 135 , 210 min follow ingestion rehydration beverage . The primary outcome variable percentage fluid retain , i.e. , difference volume ingest cumulative urine produce 3.5 h percentage volume ingest . Body mass , urine specific gravity , total body water , rating vigor affect assess prior exercise , exercise state dehydration , 210 min post-exercise follow rehydration . A one-way ANOVA use test hypothesis rehydration , primary outcome variable .</detailed_description>
