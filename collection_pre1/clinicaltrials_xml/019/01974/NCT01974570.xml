	<brief_summary>Hypertension important risk factor cardiovascular ( CVD ) renal disease . Epidemiological study show direct relationship blood pressure CVD , cardiovascular mortality increase progressively throughout range blood pressure , include prehypertensive range . There also evidence cell animal study shrimp tissue hydrolysate may higher ACE inhibitory activity marine protein hydrolysates . It hypothesize Marealis RPC ( refine peptide concentrate ) low systolic blood pressure subject elevate blood pressure .</brief_summary>
