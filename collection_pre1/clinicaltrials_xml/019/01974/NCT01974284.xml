	<brief_title>Percutaneous Ethanol Injection Primary Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize percutaneous ethanol ablation ( PEA ) primary papillary thyroid microcarcinoma ( PTMC ) equivalent oncologic outcomes current treatment option include observation , thyroid lobectomy total thyroidectomy . In addition , hypothesize yield superior long-term quality life , include measure pain , voice , cosmesis standard surgical therapy ( total thyroidectomy ) . If hypothesis correct , finding study potential fundamentally change clinical management group patient . This study change initial design : 2 arm study compare PEA surgery ( Amended April 30 , 2015 ) . The change design make base several discussion within Yale Endocrine Surgery , patient diagnose PTMC , knowledge institution perform PEA PTMC standard care . The study team contact numerous potential subject interested PEA unwilling randomize surgery . Because patient interested PEA appear firmly idea thyroidectomy , believe would unable enroll sufficient patient study protocol originally stand .</detailed_description>
