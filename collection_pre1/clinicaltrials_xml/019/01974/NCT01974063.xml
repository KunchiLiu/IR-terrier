	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking evokes major change biology airway epithelium , cell population take brunt stress cigarette smoke cell population central pathogenesis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lung cancer . The focus study identify difference two popular alternative nicotine delivery strategy , shisha electronic cigarette , airway epithelium compare cigarette smoking . We hypothesize alternative nicotine delivery strategy disorder airway epithelial biology , different way cigarette smoking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternate Nicotine Delivery Systems Airway Epithelial Biology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Research Questions We hypothesize shisha smoking electronic cigarette disorder airway biology , disorder biology differs result cigarette smoking , suggest alternative nicotine delivery method cause lung disease , perhaps phenotypes different cigarette smoking . Aim 1 : To assess hypothesis shisha smoking disorder biology airway epithelium , change distinct cigarette smoker . Aim 2 : To evaluate hypothesis smoker switch smoke cigarette smoke electronic cigarette , partial normalization disorder airway epithelial biology , partial normalization different associate complete cessation cigarette smoking . Standard Experimental Procedures All study population assessment carry protocol already cover IRB approve protocol , `` Collection Airway , Blood and/or Urine Specimens Subjects Research Studies '' ( IRB # 1204012331 ) ; purpose protocol formalize timing assessment underlie hypothesis assess . The protocol design assess gene expression lung cell nonsmoker , smoker ex-smokers . The purpose present study asses shisha smoke electronic cigarette disorder airway biology , see disordered biology differs result cigarette smoking , suggest alternative nicotine delivery method cause lung disease , perhaps phenotypes different cigarette smoking . This new protocol use exist IRB approve protocol , `` Collection Airway , Blood and/or Urine Specimens Subjects Research Studies ( `` Airway '' ) '' ( IRB # 1204012331 ) , assessments procedure study . This protocol design formalize time point carry various test parameter ( see Table II timeline study parameter ) . Recruitment protocol cohort individual recruit `` Airway '' study . Research subject recruit protocol , sign `` Airway '' inform consent form also consent form protocol . The standard clinical care pulmonary physician encourage smoker stop smoking ; hence , research participant smoke encouraged stop smoking . If decide , receive standard care smoke cessation aid include counsel medication . Subjects enrol Group E study receive alternative nicotine delivery method electronic cigarette .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Group A Nonsmokers All study subject healthy accord Weill Cornell IRB protocol # 1204012331 willing able provide inform consent follow study repeat bronchoscopies . Subjects male female ≥18 yr age . Nonsmoker define someone smoke &lt; 100 cigarette &lt; 10 shisha pipe per lifetime whose urine nicotine &lt; 2 ng/ml and/or urine cotinine &lt; 5 ng/ml , entry study . Group B Current cigarette smoker All study subject healthy accord Weill Cornell IRB protocol # 1204012331 willing able provide inform consent follow study repeat bronchoscopies . Subjects male female ≥18 year age . Active smoker define selfreport urine nicotine &gt; 30 ng/ml and/or urine cotinine &gt; 50 ng/ml . Group C Current shisha smoker All study subject healthy accord Weill Cornell IRB protocol # 1204012331 willing able provide inform consent follow study repeat bronchoscopies . Subjects male female ≥18 yr age . Shisha smoker define selfreport smoking &gt; 4 pipes/wk carboxyhemoglobin &gt; 2.5 . Group D Current smoker stop smoke All study subject healthy accord Weill Cornell IRB protocol # 1204012331 willing able provide inform consent follow study repeat bronchoscopies . Subjects male female ≥18 year age . Current smoker define selfreport urine nicotine &gt; 30 ng/ml and/or urine cotinine &gt; 50 ng/ml . Subjects must current smoker willing stop smoking contra indication take varenicline . Group E Current smoker switch electronic cigarette All study subject healthy accord Weill Cornell IRB protocol # 1204012331 willing able provide inform consent follow study repeat bronchoscopies . Subjects male female ≥18 year age . Current smoker define selfreport urine nicotine &gt; 30 ng/mL and/or urine cotinine &gt; 50 ng/ml . Subjects must willing switch tobacco cigarettes electronic cigarette . All exclusion criterion apply `` Airway '' ( IRB # 1204012331 ) protocol . Additional exclusion criterion specific protocol follow : Groups AE No Weill Cornell ( include GMS ) student include , student institution may include . A potential pool Weill Cornell employee may enter study provide oversight study PI coinvestigators . Groups D E Current smoker stop smoking Subjects , opinion responsible investigator , eligible take smoke cessation medication due major depressive and/or significant psychiatric disorder .</criteria>
