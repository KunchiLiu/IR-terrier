Additionally , COCs contraindicate certain group woman outline The Centers Disease Control Medical Eligibility Criteria ( 11 ) . Given high prevalence oral contraceptive user commonly discontinue use secondary side effect eligible use result underlie health condition , development novel oral non-hormonal method equally effective pregnancy prevention warrant . This current study aim evaluate effect FDA approve drug , Cilostazol , human oocyte maturation . Such study conduct date .

	<detailed_description>Combined oral contraceptive pill ( COCs ) commonly use hormonal form birth control United States least 87 % woman reproductive age report oral contraceptive use point life ( 9 ) . Despite frequent use , six twelve month discontinuation rate oral contraceptive pill 31 47 % respectively ( 17 ) , common reason discontinuation attribute side effect abnormal bleeding , headache , weight gain . Additionally , COCs contraindicate certain group woman outline The Centers Disease Control Medical Eligibility Criteria ( 11 ) . Given high prevalence oral contraceptive user commonly discontinue use secondary side effect eligible use result underlie health condition , development novel oral non-hormonal method equally effective pregnancy prevention warrant . The potential development non-hormonal contraception present scientific literature since 1980s point critical component gametogenesis mammalian oocyte classify . Bornslaeger colleague discover high concentration intracellular cAMP , important second messenger many biological process , inhibit resumption meiosis I mouse oocyte ( 3 ) . Later study demonstrate phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor , capable prevent breakdown cAMP , able prevent resumption meiosis mouse oocytes culture vitro ( 6 ) . Since 1980s , additional study examine phosphodiesterase inhibitor role prevention oocyte maturation . Tsafriri colleague show phosphodiesterase inhibitor able exert effect selectively via type specific isoforms . This study reveal granulosa cell exert effect via type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitor oocytes respond signal via type 3 phosphodiesterase inhibitor oocyte maturation prevent presence PDE3 inhibitor yet ovulation unaffected ( 15 ) . Most recently , Jensen colleague examine vitro vivo effect phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor ORG 9935 oocyte maturation rhesus monkey . In animal study , find vitro , ORG 9935 concentration 1.0umol/l able completely inhibit oocyte maturation ( 7 ) . In vivo model demonstrate similar reduction oocyte maturation , dramatic reduction monkey treat extend dose regimen ORG 9935 ( 200mg/kg/d ) prior ovulation ( 8 ) . Additionally , pregnancy rate macaque treat ORG 9935 study compare control . Overall , statistically significant decrease pregnancy rate macaque treat PDE3 inhibitor ; however , appear evidence dose response animal become pregnant serum ORG 9935 level 300nM/L ( 9 ) . Despite clear dose response , author study acknowledge PDE3-Is systemic effect also dose-limiting . At high dos , adverse effect tachycardia hypotension observe . Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor additionally study vitro ass oocyte maturation human . Human oocytes culture presence ORG 9935 ( 1um ) 24 hour demonstrate statistically significant reduction germinal vesicle breakdown ( early marker oocyte maturation ) comparison control oocytes ( 12 ) . However , human vivo model assess oocyte maturation follow treatment phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor exist . Cilostazol , FDA approve drug treatment intermittent claudication , class IIIa phosphodiesterase inhibitor . Its systemic effect human include vasodilation , decrease platelet aggregation , reduction triglyceride level , increase HDL cholesterol level ( 4 ) . Human clinical trial address fertility pregnancy rate ; however , manufacturer product label report fertility effect occur rat . Most recently , however , two animal vivo study examine pregnancy rate mice treat Cilostazol conduct ( 1,10 ) . In study , mice treat Cilostazol show completely infertile follow ; however , drug discontinue , mice unable conceive treatment cilostazol subsequently able pregnancy normal litter size . It important mention study Albarzanchi , mice receive PO cilostazol dose 7.5 15 mg PO three day ( 1 ) . In study Li conduct China , maxium dose high ( 300mg/kg ) ( 10 ) . Pregnancy outcomes study . These study demonstrate two important aspect contraceptive method : efficacy reversibility . Additionally , investigator publish Cilostazol 's fertility effect mice publish abstract demonstrate similar effect swine ( 2 ) . When human dose 100mg bid Cilostazol give prior ovulation , document pregnancy occur . Following cessation study drug , swine able conceive . Given success phosphodiesterase inhibitor vivo vitro model prevention oocyte maturation pregnancy animal model , reasonable examine potential non-hormonal oral contraceptive method . Given many FDA clinical trial need conduct , new contraceptive method take decade develop . However , since Cilostazol approve FDA medication acceptable side effect profile , believe appropriate complete initial study drug human use vivo technique validate macaque , model time peri-ovulatory event woman , ascertain possible use non-hormonal oral contraceptive . The primary objective research study determine woman take Cilostazol demonstrate impairment oocyte maturation comparison pair historic control follow ovarian follicle stimulation . For purpose study , oocyte maturation assess use oocyte maturational stage prophase I , metaphase I , metaphase II . Thus , assess percent oocyte aspirate follicle control ovarian stimulation progress beyond germinal vesicle stage ( e.g . GVBD ) woman receive cilostazol compare maturation oocyte obtain woman underwent ovarian follicle stimulation previously study drug . We propose woman undergo treatment FDA approve dose 100mg PO BID Cilostazol demonstrate impairment oocyte maturation comparison pair historic control follow ovarian follicle stimulation .</detailed_description>
