	<brief_summary>Background : - Herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) major cause genital herpes . It also cause serious infection newborn people weaken immune system . It increase risk get HIV infection spread HIV someone else . Therefore , vaccine could prevent genital herpes could improve general health world population . Researchers want study whether new vaccine , HSV529 , may use future prevent herpes infection , safe . Objectives : - To test whether new herpes vaccine safe . Eligibility : - Healthy adult 18 40 year old . Design : - Participants 3 vaccination visit , 7 follow-up visit , 3 follow-up phone call 1 year . - Each vaccination visit last 4 hour . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants blood sample take . - Participants give vaccine placebo , injection needle . They monitor 30 minute check allergic reaction . - Participants give diary card record symptom may feel later . - At follow-up visit , participant give blood sample answer health question . - In phone call , participant answer health question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Herpes simplex virus 2 ( HSV-2 ) cause genital herpes increase risk acquisition transmission HIV . An HSV-2 vaccine available . We study replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine , HSV529 , delete 2 essential viral protein , infect , replicate normal cell . The goal study determine ( ) safety HSV529 vaccine person without HSV infection , ( b ) ability vaccine elicit immune response HSV-2 include virus-specific antibody T cell response virus . Three group 20 subject randomize receive 3 dos HSV529 ( 15 subject per group ) saline placebo injection ( 5 subject per group ) . Each subject follow 6 month last dose vaccine . The 3 group ( ) subject infected HSV-2 past may may infect HSV-1 ( HSV-1+/-/HSV-2+ ) , ( b ) subject infected HSV-1 ( HSV-1+/HSV-2- ) , ( c ) subject infected HSV-1 HSV-2 ( HSV-1-/HSV-2- ) . Vaccine placebo administer Day 0 approximately 1 month 6 month enrollment .</detailed_description>

Willingness attend schedule visit able comply trial procedure ( e.g. , blood draw , completion diary card , return followup visit , accessible phone pager , able selfsample assessment asymptomatic shed HSV , plan move study area ) . 7 . Negative HIV test result determine approve FDAapproved test . Confirmatory test may require base initial assay use result . 8 . Subject willing use antiviral therapy less equal 2 day less equal 3 day injection . 9 . Subject willing forgo receipt license , live vaccine 30 day precede dose vaccine 30 day follow dose vaccine . The inactivated flu vaccine use great equal 14 day great equal 14 day administration study vaccine , felt necessary . 10 . Persons close contact infant immunocompromised individual agree avoid contact 3 day injection . 11 .

Subject must willing allow storage blood , swabs skin mucosa , biopsy skin lesion , , female subject , cervicovaginal secretion ( collect ) future research . Participation Women : Contraception : The effect HSV529 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , females subject must nonchildbearing potential i.e . either surgically sterilize ( bilateral tubal ligation , hysterectomy ) , childbearing potential sexually active male partner , must willing use highly effective method contraception ( e.g. , intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; oral contraceptive diaphragm condom combination contraceptive foam , jelly cream ; Norplant , DepoProvera , contraceptive skin patch cervical ring ) least 30 day prior vaccination 1 month final vaccination monogamous relationship male partner undergone vasectomy least 6 month prior first dose study agent . Females must negative urine pregnancy test result prior injection HSV529 placebo . During course study , woman become pregnant suspect pregnant , inform study staff primary care physician immediately . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Coenrollment Guidelines : Coenrollment trial restrict , enrollment observational study screen protocol . Study staff notify coenrollment may require approval Principal Investigator . An individual fulfilling follow criterion exclude trial enrollment : 1 . Subject pregnant lactating OR planning become pregnant timeframe begin 30 day prior first vaccination end 30 day third vaccination . 2 . Body Mass Index great 40 . 3 . Participation another clinical trial investigate vaccine , drug , medical device , medical procedure 4 week precede first trial vaccination plan participation study period 6 month last dose vaccine placebo . The noninterventional followup earlier study ( e.g. , longterm surveillance ) allow . 4 . Severe active infection serious HSV2 relate unrelated medical condition , opinion investigator , would prevent study completion . 5 . Subjects 6 symptomatic recurrence genital herpes disease within year prior Day 0 . 6 . A history HSV infection eye ( e.g. , herpes simplex interstitial keratitis uveitis ) . 7 . A history herpes gladiatorum , herpetic whitlow eczema herpeticum . 8 . A history lesion cause HSV either arm . 9 . A history herpesassociated erythema multiforme . 10 . A history clinically significant autoimmune disorder . 11 . Known suspected congenital acquire immunodeficiency 12 . Receipt anticancer chemotherapy radiation therapy within precede 6 month . 13 . Subjects use corticosteroid ( exclude topical , inhale nasal ) immunomodulating drug within 42 day prior first vaccination . An immunosuppressive dose corticosteroid define great equal 10 mg prednisone equivalent per day great equal 14 day . 14 . Subjects without spleen . 15 . Subjects receive immunoglobulin within past 6 month anticipate receipt immunoglobulin 28 day follow vaccination . 16 . Bleeding disorder , receipt anticoagulant , opinion Investigator , would interfere subject participation trial . 17 . Prior vaccination herpes simplex virus . 18 . Known allergy intolerance vaccine component [ e.g. , potassium glutamate ( possible crossreaction monosodium glutamate ) , sucrose ] vaccine contain substance . 19 . Deprived freedom administrative court order , emergency setting , hospitalize involuntarily . 20 . Current alcohol abuse drug abuse addiction . 21 .

Justification Exclusion Women Children : Exclusion Women : Pregnancy : Pregnant woman exclude study effect HSV529 develop human fetus unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Breastfeeding : Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary vaccination mother HSV529 , breastfeed discontinue mother vaccinated HSV529 . Exclusion Children : Because insufficient data regard dose adverse event available adult judge potential risk child , child exclude study .</criteria>
