	<brief_title>Improving Motor Function After Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist electromyography ( surface intramuscular ) , peripheral nerve stimulation , transcranial magnetic stimulation , electrical stimulation , hand , arm , leg , foot representation primary motor cortex , well MRI scan brain . The investigator examine physiological measurement upper low extremity muscle ( first dorsal interosseous ( FDI ) , biceps brachii ( BIC ) , anterior deltoid ( AD ) , tibialis anterior ( TA ) , hamstring ( HAMS ) quadriceps ( QUAD ) ) . This study may occur Miami Project cure Paralysis University Miami . The investigator include subject age 18 85 , healthy control individual chronic spinal cord injury occur least 6 month prior recruitment . Both healthy control spinal cord injury able perform small hand arm movement small leg foot movement . The primary outcome measure study muscle response stimulation magnetic pulse use TMS electrical stimulation peripheral nerve arm leg . The investigator propose enhance recovery motor function use new protocol high frequency non-invasive repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) motor training . Repetitive TMS use hand , arm , leg foot movement task-dependent manner induce cortical plasticity enhance voluntary output muscle associate movement . Second , rTMS apply task-dependent manner visuo-motor training task also involve movement hand , arm , legs foot .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female Veterans non Veterans spinal cord injury least 6 month injury sustain . The investigator also plan enroll control subject history spinal cord injury . Participants unimpaired healthy control : Male female age 1885 year Right hand Able complete precision grip hand Able complete full wrist flexionextension bilaterally Able walk unassisted Able complete full ankle flexionextension bilaterally Participants spinal cord injury : Male female age 1885 year Chronic SCI ( 6 month injury ) Spinal Cord injury L5 The ability produce visible precision grip force one hand Individuals ability pick small object ( large paperclip ) table independently Able perform small wrist flexion extension ( measure goniometer ) The ability perform small visible contraction dorsiflexor hip flexor muscle No subject exclude base race , religion , ethnicity , gender HIV status . Exclusion criterion enrollment For SCI Healthy Control Subjects ( stimulation ) : Uncontrolled medical problem include pulmonary , cardiovascular orthopedic disease Any debilitating disease prior SCI cause exercise intolerance Premorbid , ongoing major depression psychosis , alter cognitive status History head injury stroke Metal plate skull History seizures Receiving drug act primarily central nervous system , low seizure threshold ( see appendix 2 ) Pregnant females Ongoing cord compression syrinx spinal cord suffer spinal cord disease spinal stenosis , spina bifida , MS , herniated cervical disk Individuals scalp shrapnel , cochlear implant , aneurysm clip .</criteria>
