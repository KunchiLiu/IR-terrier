	<brief_summary>Background : - Vaginal yeast infection cause fungus call Candida . Candida live harmlessly vagina , woman symptoms vaginal yeast infection point life . Antibiotics increase risk yeast infection , unclear . They may disrupt balance healthy bacteria vagina . This could make hard body fight yeast infection . Researchers give healthy woman common antibiotic placebo . They study antibiotic affect bacteria yeast vagina part body . This let researcher study normal change healthy bacteria yeast time . Objectives : - To see study drug change healthy bacteria vagina , change may increase risk yeast infection . Eligibility : - Healthy woman age 18 40 allergic penicillin . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam ( include vaginal exam ) , blood test test sexually transmit disease . - Participants must take birth control pills least 3 month , study . - Participants take study antibiotic placebo 10 day . - Participants 7 study visit 3 month . Visits time around participant menstrual cycle . - At visit , participant answer question health undergo test . These may include swabs vagina , mouth skin well blood test . Vaginal fluid , saliva urine also collect . - Between visit , participant collect stool vaginal sample home bring next clinic visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol prospective , interventional , randomize , double-blind , placebo control longitudinal study design investigate microbiomic immunologic perturbation lead vulvovaginal candidiasis ( VVC ) woman receive antibiotic . VVC common fungal infection affect woman . Although asymptomatic vaginal Candida colonization occur ~10-20 % healthy woman , ~75 % woman experience least one episode symptomatic VVC lifetime . Nonetheless , local mucosal factor allow Candida convert commensal organism opportunistic pathogen well define . Antibiotic use ( particularly beta-lactams ) well-recognized risk factor development VVC healthy woman , suggest alteration endogenous vaginal microbial flora result deregulation local mucosal anti-Candida immune response . However , commensal vaginal microbiota important protection Candida infection , mechanism ( ) whereby vaginal microbiota influence local mucosal immune response Candida , remain unknown . To address question , healthy woman reproductive age receive 10-day course amoxicillin ( broad-spectrum , beta-lactam antibiotic ) placeboand undergo vaginal sample microbiomic immunologic analysis , antibiotic administration 90-day period . The hypothesis study woman develop amoxicillin-associated VVC characteristic microbiomic profile ( compare woman absent asymptomatic Candida colonization ) associate impairment local mucosal anti-Candida immune response . The aim study elucidate vaginal microbiomic immunologic perturbation allow Candida transition commensal pathogen context antibiotic administration . A good understanding role specific microbiota mucosal immune factor avert Candida infection may lead design target preventive and/or therapeutic intervention VVC .</detailed_description>
