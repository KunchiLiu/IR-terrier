	<brief_summary>The purpose transfusion pack red blood cell overcome acute chronic anemia cause tissue hypoxia . It increase hemoglobin concentration consequently increase oxygen delivery peripheral tissue . The perioperative period major surgery field particularly favorable development tissue hypoxia , associate increased mortality postoperative morbidity . Optimization oxygen transport tissue preoperative period accompany significant reduction major complication . Clinical complication ( infectious otherwise ) relate transfusion cap Red Blood cell Caps ( RBC ) well know . Many study seem evidence potentially deleterious effect transfusion , especially patient poor condition , related storage time . Indeed , storage , impaired blood-related storage create . It metabolic , biochemical molecular level . Many study , carry particular cardiac surgery patient suitable transfusion RBC , focus effect transfusion consumption transport oxygen demonstrate impact conservation lesion role vivo . In particular , single-center retrospective American study show reduction postoperative complication patient receive RBC 14 day . However one confound factor present transfuse RBCs leukoreduced ( unlike French transfusion policy ) . In addition , great part clinical study controversial . That aim ass , retrospective study data , impact transfusion red red blood cell within 14 day post-operative morbidity mortality , compare usual transfusion practice cardiac surgery patient .</brief_summary>
