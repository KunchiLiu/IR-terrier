	<brief_title>A Randomized , Open-label , Comparative Study Evaluate Intermittent Dosing Regimen Fluticasone Propionate 0.05 % Cream ( Twice Per Week ) Reducing Risk Relapse When Added Regular Daily Moisturization Using PHYSIOGEL Lotion Paediatric Subjects With Stabilized Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) chronic relapse skin disease cause intervention plural unspecific stimulation specific allergen accompany cutaneous physiologic dysfunction . AD one common skin disease effect 20 % Children 1-3 % adults country world . The data Chinese epidemiologic research show prevalence rate AD 10.9 % school-age adolescent 15.3 % preschool child 2010 . Around 65 % patient AD develop symptom first year life ; 90 % patient develop symptom 5 year age . Onset atopic dermatitis adolescence later uncommon . The objective treatment AD relief symptom reduce cutaneous inflammation . Emollients mainstay maintenance therapy able restore skin barrier function . Topical glucocorticoid recommend first line treatment important anti-inflammatory drug use AD , especially acute phase . One troublesome feature AD chronic relapse nature suggest need long-term therapy disease . The common long-term treatment AD reactive treatment approach base daily application emollient accompany application topical glucocorticoid ( TCS ) calcineurin inhibitor ( TCI ) 'as need ' . However , new alternative treatment 'proactive therapy ' proven effective well-tolerated reduce AD relapse clinical trial recommend guideline . This proactive therapy start intensive topical anti-inflammatory therapy lesion virtually clear , follow long-term , low-dose intermittent application anti-inflammatory drug previous affect clinically healthy-looking skin combine daily application emollient always unaffected area . Latest Chinese guideline AD recommend application emollient moisturizers acute maintenance phase , intermittent application topical corticosteroid daily use emollient moisturizers first-line option AD therapy . However , concept 'proactive therapy ' AD well accept Chinese dermatologist . In context , study demonstrate 'proactive therapy ' efficacy do mainly Caucasian subject instead Chinese population . For reason , still exist unmet medical need generate data combination use fluticasone propionate moisturizer AD maintenance therapy China . Rationale Fluticasone propionate ( FP ) synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid medium strength topical treatment skin disease . The established glucocorticoid show anti-inflammatory , anti-proliferative immunosuppressive effect . FP demonstrate havinga moderate anti-inflammatory effect associate good compliance among patient , low incidence cross-sensitivity reaction weak atrophogenicity . FP show significant effect hypothalamic pituitary axis ( HPA ) , due lipophilicity , rapid hepatic biotransformation , reflect favourable ratio topical systemic activity . The result clinical trial moderate severe AD demonstrate FP cause major local side-effect . First-line therapy AD paediatric patient consist application mildly moderately potent topical glucocorticoid combine emollient . FP cream 0.05 % also proven safe treatment moderate severe AD 4 week child 3 month age old . More one study demonstrate efficacy safety FP 0.05 % cream proactive therapy AD . A large multicentre study compare intermittent dose regimen FP 0.05 % cream ( twice per week ) drug-free vehicle reduce risk relapse adult child ( 44 % 66 % respectively ) age 3 month 65 year moderate severe , stabilize AD . Both regimens add regular daily emollient . The result show patient receive intermittent FP cream maintenance phase 7.7 time ( paediatric patient even 8.1 time ) less likely AD relapse compare patient vehicle cream . And maintenance therapy FP turn safe well-tolerated . Subsequent similar large scale study compare efficacy safety FP 0.05 % cream 0.005 % ointment reduce risk relapse . The difference patient age 12-65 year moderate severe AD experiencing flare enrol . FP 0.05 % effective reducing relapse FP 0.005 % : former reduce risk relapse six fold latter two fold compare emollient alone . Median time relapse 6 week emollient alone compare 16 week additional FP . Both medication well-tolerated low risk local adverse effect . First-line therapy AD paediatric patient consist application mildly moderately potent topical glucocorticoid combine emollient . Except topical glucocorticoid , emollient basic treatment AD , recommend emphasize almost AD guideline . PHYSIOGEL lotion , hypoallergenic emollient , contain physiological lipid , mimic structure composition skin 's protective lipid barrier DMS ( Dermal Membrane Structure ) technique . PHYSIOGEL lotion provide immediate long lasting moisture prevent skin dryness , recommend dermatologist AD adjunctive daily care . It advise apply thin film PHYSIOGEL lotion twice daily ideally people age dry , sensitive barrier dysfunction skin ( include people suffer AD ) . In summary , superiority proactive therapy combination FP emollient drug-free vehicle emollient alone demonstrate . Proactive therapy FP prevent , delay , reduce occurrence exacerbation AD relapse without obvious safety concern . Besides , PHYSIOGEL lotion , emollient physiological lipid DMS technology , good efficacy repair skin barrier . In regard , possibly meaningful demonstrate efficacy safety FP PHYSIOGEL lotion combination reduce AD relapse . OBJECTIVE ( S ) This study aim demonstrate risk AD relapse significantly reduce extended intermittent dose Fluticasone propionate ( FP ) 0.05 % cream addition regular emollient therapy ( PHYSIOGEL lotion ) maintenance treatment ( 20 week ) atopic dermatitis ( AD ) compare application emollient alone . The secondary objective evaluate safety FP 0.05 % cream emollient combination usage AD maintenance treatment determine optimal treatment regimen Chinese paediatric patient AD . Study Design This open-label , randomize , comparative study . The study include 4 phase : SCREENING , ACUTE , MAINTENANCE FOLLOW-UP . After subject sign write informed consent form ( Visit 1 ) , enter SCREENING phase check eligibility within 7 day 1st dose FP 0.05 % cream . During SCREENING phase , investigator collect subject ' demographic data , medical history , Atopic Dermatitis ' diagnosis treatment history , concomitant medication . Investigator need assess AD Severity conduct physical examination . Substance abuse evaluate . And pregnant test must conduct check Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) . -Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study ( 6 week last dose investigational product ) manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . The Visit 2 occur 1st dose FP 0.05 % cream . At Visit 2 , investigator need evaluate Eczema Area , AD Severity Visual Skin Assessment . Vital sign measure record . Subjects need complete questionnaire QoL investigator 's instruction . Investigator must confirm subject ' eligibility ACUTE phase inclusion exclusion criterion check . All subject eligible ACUTE phase receive twice daily FP 0.05 % cream . FP 0.05 % cream apply affected site newly occur AD site . The efficacy safety ACUTE phase assess every 2 week 4 week Treatment Success dependent time point come first . At visit ( Visit 3 , W-2±2days ; Visit 4 , W0±2days ) ACUTE phase , investigator need assess Eczema Area , AD Severity , Visual Skin Assessment , conduct physical examination , vital sign measurement . Randomization process investigator confirms subject 's eligibility MAINTENANCE phase . The day randomization D0 MAINTENANCE phase . If patient achieve Treatment Success meet criterion MAINTENANCE phase visit interval ACUTE phase , Visit 4 move earlier schedule date . If time treatment success within 2 week Visit 2 , subject enter Visit 4 directly skip Visit 3 . If patient n't achieve Treatment Success 4-week FP 0.05 % cream treatment , discontinue study treatment conduct End Therapy Visit .
