	<brief_summary>Background : - Recent advance cancer research lead new therapy treat disease . It important continue advance discover new one . To , researcher need tissue sample solid tumor . This study collect sample people already schedule procedure National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( NIHCC ) . Objectives : - To collect tissue sample use study new way treat tumor . Eligibility : - Adults 18 year old , precancerous cancerous solid tumor schedule surgery biopsy NIHCC . Design : - Before procedure , participant small blood sample take . - Some participant undergo leukapheresis . In procedure , blood remove tube one arm circulate machine remove white blood cell . The blood , minus white blood cell , return tube arm . The procedure take 3 4 hour . - For participant , surgery biopsy , piece tumor piece normal tissue near remove study . The rest tumor precancerous growth send lab analysis . - Participants return clinic 6 week operation routine checkup . Some may return additional follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Recent advance insights molecular pathogenesis cancer lead development novel molecular biologic target therapy treatment advance cancer patient . A critical challenge extend study involve identification validation new therapeutic target future cancer therapy . - As Surgical Oncologists NCI , interest identifying novel molecular biologic target facilitate development future cancer therapy . In addition , primary responsibility provide surgical consultative service NIH . As , uniquely position acquire perform important study solid tumor tissue help identify therapeutic target may significant clinical ramification . OBJECTIVES : - Primary Objective : To collect biologic sample patient undergo diagnostic , preventative , therapeutic intervention premalignant , primary metastatic solid tumor purpose identify novel molecular biologic therapeutic target ELIGIBILITY : - Patients great equal 18 year age radiographic evidence clinical suspicion , genetic predisposition , biochemical evidence , histologically/cytologically proven solid neoplasm require diagnostic , preventative , therapeutic intervention part diagnosis /or treatment and/or follow neoplasm - Patients without solid tumor diagnostic , preventative , therapeutic intervention perform , surgical quality safety outcomes data generate . - Patients laboratory physical examination parameter within acceptable limit standard practice guideline prior plan intervention DESIGN : - A tissue acquisition trial tissue obtain time intervention - Tissue blood process time collection , transfer Clinical Pharmacology program ( CPP ) processing . - No investigational therapy give . - It anticipated 1000 patient enrol period 10 year</detailed_description>
