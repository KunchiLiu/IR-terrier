	<detailed_description>Most solid cancer arise childhood develop embryonic tissue . The frequent association paediatric cancer abnormality development underline link oncogenesis embryogenesis . However , beside know malformative syndrome predispose one several type tumour variable penetrance ( NF1 , Wiedemann-Beckwith , Denys-Drash , Fanconi disease ) , association abnormality development tumour badly know little investigated , listed present systematically register child cancer . The cytogenetic exploration malformative syndrome associate tumour historically allow describe constitutional chromosomal abnormality major interest understand oncogenesis pathway frequent sporadic tumour ( del 11p13 WT1 ; del 13q14 Rb1 ) . So , rare even exceptional clinical presentation enrich knowledge common pathology . Our objective analyze detail multidisciplinary way large number possible case unusual presentation associate pediatric Tumor And abnormality Development ( TAD ) . Principle objective - Registration developmental abnormality pediatric patient cancer retrospectively prospectively period three year nationwide scale Secondary objectives - record tumoral pathology know contexts cancer predisposition , - record tumoral pathology occur association one developmental anomaly , association might already describe - identify locate biological sample patient register coordination national pediatric biobank project - characterize molecular basis identify association developmental abnormality tumor . These molecular study straight included present project specifically , conduct basis clinical data thanks biobank network . - biannual analysis aggregate data steer committee do identify informative association warrant clinical study biological data - Biological study perform conjunction local investigator official local biobank , coordination operation BIOCAP</detailed_description>
