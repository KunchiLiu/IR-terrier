	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether information regard GA GA-driven intervention improve outcome old cancer patient receive first-line second-line chemotherapy compare rate chemotherapy toxicity , hospitalization , dose delay early termination treatment patient without GA-driven intervention . The investigator identify information useful base questionnaire response blood test . These result use good understand recommendation intervention benefit old cancer patient . It hope tool , well-established identify area risk , provide meaningful opportunity intervention promote safety cancer management . The investigator able use information teach others best care adult age 70 old cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Geriatric Assessment Intervention Older Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although cancer common old patient , optimal treatment cancer subset patient well established . As result lack knowledge safety efficacy chemotherapy old adult , significant proportion old patient receive chemotherapy toxicity . There also little information regard best make decision implement intervention improve outcome old patient cancer receive treatment . Additionally , mark heterogeneity geriatric population , patient similar chronologic age may wide disparity overall health status . Geriatricians utilize tool call Geriatric Assessment ( GA ) gauge old patient 's overall health status identify potential area deficit . The GA comprehensive tool , incorporate assessment physical function , co-morbid condition , social support , nutritional , psychological , cognitive status medication review . A small number study oncology literature demonstrate value GA guide cancer-directed treatment plan older patient . GA identify potential area deficit older patient 's overall health status show predict chemotherapy toxicity guide intervention improve outcome old patient . Studies intervention community-dwelling older adult demonstrate efficacy improve deficit identify GA . However , old patient cancer , currently limit data regard GA affect decision-making treatment impact overall clinical care . In two-arm , randomize pilot study , evaluate effect GA GA-driven intervention outcomes old cancer patient receive first-line second-line chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
