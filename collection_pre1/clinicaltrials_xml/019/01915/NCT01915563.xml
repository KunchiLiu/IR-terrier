	<brief_title>Rest After Spontaneous Breathing Trial Prevention Post-extubation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intubation mechanical ventilation relate several complication . This increase risk mortality intensive care patient . So , always look early extubation patient recover trigger disease . In spite standardized manoeuvre decide readiness extubation quite good described failure extubation rate 5 % reintubation rate 15 % . Furthermore several risk factor associate major failure rate : &gt; 65 year old , congestive cardiac insufficiency , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , APACHE II &gt; 12 extubation day , BMI &gt; 30 , ineffective cough , lot bronchial secretion ( need &gt; 2 endotracheal suction last 8h extubation ) , failure previous SBT , alteration high respiratory tract intubation 7 days.Patients without factor risk extubation failure rate 10 % present extubation failure increase 30 % . The used technique wean trial name spontaneous breathe trial ( SBT ) . Some physiological aspect suggest breathe endotracheal tube could really effort trial . So hypothesis period rest SBT extubation could reduce extubation failure rate .</detailed_description>
