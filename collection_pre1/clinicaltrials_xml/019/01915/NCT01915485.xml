	<brief_summary>Medullary thyroid cancer neuroendocrine tumour . As , somatostatin receptor membrane . Furthermore , little available treat patient disease progression . The investigator hypothesize tumor may respond 177-Lu-DOTA Tyr3-octreotate ligand somatostatin receptor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medullary thyroid carcinoma also locate scintigraphy 111In-DTPA ( diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid ) -octreotide . In study , sensitivity detection tumor method , 50-70 % . The relationship calcitonin carcinoembryonic antigen level significantly high patient scintigraphy perform 111In-DTPA-octreotide . This imply somatostatin receptor detect `` vivo '' different form medullary thyroid carcinoma Based specific bind analogs somatostatin receptor present membrane tumor medullary thyroid possible devise therapy target-directed use beta-emitting radionuclides ( therapeutic property ) couple molecule . The main radiopharmaceutical use purpose currently 177 Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-OCTREOTATE 90Yttrium-DOTA ] -TOC . The medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) rare neuroendocrine tumor , account 4.9 % total thyroid carcinoma , however , compare well differentiate carcinoma , present bad prognosis . The tumor staging , restaging essential since surgery curative method . Elevated plasma concentration calcitonin ( CT ) / high level carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) , biochemical marker MTC , suggest presence residual malignant disease / recurrence metastasis distance . After surgery aggressive 40 % patient persistent disease 10 % , undetectable post-surgery CT , develop tumor recurrence . At point therapeutic option scarce available area . Although investigator use structural radiological study use ultrasound , compute tomography magnetic resonance image stag disease , provide functional information . In context , nuclear medicine examination add data growth potential expression pattern receptor diagnostic therapeutic purpose . In 2007 , Ong SC . et al . Showed 18 FDG PET / CT ability detect residual disease , recurrent metastatic disease sensitivity 78 % calcitonin 1000pg/ml . Already Iten et al . Using principle tumor express receptor somatostatin use OctreoScan Â® subsequent treatment 90Yttrium-DOTA ] -TOC show advantage location disease possibility make image guide therapy . These author also demonstrate clinical benefit extent 25 % patient show reduced calcitonin . The investigator hypothesize tumor may respond 177-Lu-DOTA Tyr3-octreotate .</detailed_description>
