	<criteria>1 . Subject must great equal 18 year age . 2 . Subjects must advance hematologic malignancy include : Phase 1/ Dose escalation : 1 . Diagnosis acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria ; Disease refractory relapse ( defined reappearance &gt; 5 % blast bone marrow ) . Untreated AML , great equal 60 year age candidate standard therapy due age , performance status , and/or adverse risk factor , accord treat physician approval Medical Monitor ; 2 . Diagnosis Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) accord WHO classification refractory anemia excess blast ( subtype RAEB1 RAEB2 ) , consider highrisk Revised International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSSR ) , recurrent refractory , subject intolerant establish therapy know provide clinical benefit condition ( i.e. , subject must candidate regimen know provide clinical benefit ) , accord treat physician approval Medical Monitor . Phase 1/Part 1 Expansion : Arm 1 : Relapsed refractory AML age great equal 60 year subject AML regardless age relapse follow Bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) . Arm 2 : Relapsed refractory AML age &lt; 60 year , exclude subject AML relapse follow BMT . Arm 3 : Untreated AML age great equal 60 year decline standard care chemotherapy . Arm 4 : Isocitrate dehydrogenase protein , 2 ( IDH2 ) mutate advanced hematologic malignancy eligible Arms 1 3 . Phase 2 : Diagnosis AML accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria disease relapse refractory define : Subjects relapse allogeneic transplantation ; Subjects second later relapse ; Subjects refractory initial induction reinduction treatment Subjects relapse within 1 year initial treatment , exclude patient favorablerisk status accord NCCN Guidelines ( NCCN 2015 ) . Favorablerisk cytogenetics : inv ( 16 ) , ( 16 ; 16 ) , ( 8 ; 21 ) , ( 15 ; 17 ) 3 . Subjects must document IDH2 genemutated disease : For subject dose escalation phase Part 1 Expansion , IDH2 mutation may base local evaluation . ( Centralized testing perform retrospectively . ) For subject Phase 2 portion trial , central test IDH2 mutation bone marrow aspirate peripheral blood , require screen confirm eligibility 4 . Subjects must amenable serial bone marrow sampling , peripheral blood sample urine sampling study . The diagnosis evaluation AML MDS make bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy . If aspirate unobtainable ( i.e. , `` dry tap '' ) , diagnosis may make core biopsy . Screening bone marrow aspirate peripheral blood sample require subject . A bone marrow biopsy must collect adequate aspirate attainable unless : A bone marrow aspirate biopsy perform part standard care within 28 day prior start study treatment ; Slides bone marrow aspirate , biopsy stain peripheral blood smear available local central pathology reviewer ; A bone marrow aspirate sample acquire within 28 day prior start study treatment send cytogenetic analysis . 5 . Subjects must able understand willing sign inform consent .

Subjects must adequate renal function evidence : • Serum creatinine ≤2.0 × ULN OR • Creatinine clearance great 40 mL/min base CockroftGault glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) estimation : ( 140 Age ) x ( weight kg ) x ( 0.85 female ) /72 x serum creatinine 10 . Subjects must recover clinically relevant toxic effect prior surgery , radiotherapy , therapy intend treatment cancer . ( Subjects residual Grade 1 toxicity , example Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy residual alopecia , allow approval Medical Monitor . ) 11 . Female subject childbearing potential must agree undergo medically supervised pregnancy test prior start study drug . The first pregnancy test perform screening ( within 7 day prior first study drug administration ) , day first study drug administration confirm negative prior dose Day 1 dose subsequent cycle . 12 . Female subject reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start therapy . Subjects reproductive potential define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy tubal occlusion naturally postmenopausal ( i.e. , menstruate ) least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Females reproductive potential well fertile men partner female reproductive potential must agree abstain sexual intercourse use two highly effective form contraception time give informed consent , study 120 day ( female male ) follow last dose AG221 . A highly effective form contraception define hormonal oral contraceptive , injectables , patch , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method ( e.g. , synthetic condom , diaphragm , cervical cap spermicidal foam , cream , gel ) , male partner sterilization . 13 . Able adhere study visit schedule ( ie , clinic visit study site mandatory , unless note otherwise particular study visit ) protocol requirement . 1 . Subjects undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) within 60 day first dose AG221 , subject immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT time screening , clinically significant graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) . ( The use stable dose oral steroid post GVHD and/or topical steroid ongoing skin GVHD permit Medical Monitor approval . ) 2 . Subjects receive systemic anticancer therapy radiotherapy &lt; 14 day prior first day study drug administration . ( Hydroxyurea allow 28 day start AG221 control peripheral leukemic blast subject white blood cell [ WBC ] count &gt; 30,000/μL well prior enrollment ) . 3 . Subjects receive small molecule investigational agent &lt; 14 day prior first day study drug administration . In addition , first dose AG221 occur period ≥5 halflives investigational agent elapse . 4 . Subjects take follow sensitive cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) substrate medication narrow therapeutic range exclude study unless transfer medication within ≥5 halflives prior dosing : paclitaxel ( CYP2C8 ) warfarin , phenytoin ( CYP2C9 ) , Smephenytoin ( CYP2C19 ) , thioridazine ( CYP2D6 ) , theophylline tizanidine ( CYP1A2 ) . 5 .
