	<brief_summary>Background : - The Age-Related Eye Disease 2 Study ( AREDS2 ) look two eye disease . These age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) cataract . Participants study take supplement pill participant additional picture take eye . That study . Researchers want follow-up study participant finish take pill , see cause long-term effect AMD . This study combine follow-up visit AREDS2 study possible . Objectives : - To learn effect oral supplement AMD . Eligibility : - People complete AREDS2 study . Design : - Participants 2 study visit 6 18 month . - Each visit last 5 hour . The visit combine annual follow-up visit AREDS2 study possible . - At visit , participant undergo eye exam photography . - The eye exam include test sight , measure eye pressure , check eye movement . To examine inside eye , pupil dilate eye drop . - Photographs inside eye may take eye exam eye dilate . - A contact lens may place eye briefly look retina back eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effects Supplements Eye Disease Participants From Age-Related Eye Disease Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Age Related Eye Disease Study 2 ( AREDS2 ) multicenter Phase III randomize clinical trial design assess effect oral supplementation high dos macular xanthophyll ( lutein zeaxanthin ) and/or omega-3 LCPUFAs treatment age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , cataract moderate vision loss . In addition objective , study provide information clinical course , prognosis , risk factor development progression AMD cataract . Other study goal include evaluation eliminate beta-carotene and/or reduce zinc original AREDS formulation progression development AMD . AREDS2 also seek validate fundus photographic AMD scale develop AREDS . Inclusion criterion AREDS2 result enrollment participant intermediate AMD , define presence large drusen , without additional pigmentary change . Owing longitudinal nature AREDS2 study , anatomical feature AMD study participant monitor characterized function time understand step AMD progression . Spectral domain OCT ( SDOCT ) non-invasive image technology speed resolution image fine structure drusen photoreceptor layer . With annotation process three-dimensional SDOCT scan , focal AMD pathology drusen map monitored time . The AREDS2 Ancillary SDOCT Study ( A2A SDOCT ) add use novel high resolution three-dimensional OCT retinal image four AREDS2 study center examine 400 participant AREDS2 clinical trial . The purpose ancillary AREDS2 study ( study acronym : A2A_SDOCT ) identify whether measurable AMD pathology ( drusen , photoreceptor layer thickness , early finding geographic atrophy ( GA ) neovascularization ) image spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SDOCT ) predict progression AMD vision loss . The A2A_SDOCT study begin ancillary AREDS2 study ; however AREDS2 stop gather participant data October 31 , 2012 terminate soon . This extension study need complete AREDS2 dataset collect image one two additional time point , study start year behind AREDS2 study . The data collection period extension end April 30 , 2014 . Data analysis conclude October 31 , 2014 . All AREDS2 study procedure guideline data collection follow , describe , even though visit fall outside AREDS2 study timeline .</detailed_description>
