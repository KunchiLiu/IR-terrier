	<detailed_description>The process recovery schizophrenia involve resolve persistent symptom improve functional outcome . Our research group demonstrate use environmental support patient 's home bypass deficit cognitive function treatment call Cognitive Adaptation Training ( CAT ) improve adherence medication functional outcome schizophrenia Cognitive Behavior Therapy ( CBT ) decrease symptomatology negative effect persist symptom upon individual disorder . Data suggest treatment modality specific effect . Targeting functional outcome persistent positive symptom multimodal cognitive treatment provide patient 's home likely robust effect functional outcome , persistent symptom distress cause symptoms individual schizophrenia . We propose randomize 200 individual schizophrenia take antipsychotic medication one four psychosocial treatment period 9 month : 1 ) CAT , 2 ) CBT , 3 ) Multimodal Cognitive Treatment ( Mcog ; integrate treatment feature aspect CAT CBT ) , 4 ) standard treatment usual ( TAU ) . Patients follow 6 month treatment complete . Outcomes assess baseline every 3 month . Primary outcome variable include measure symptomatology functional outcome . We hypothesize patient treatment CBT component ( CBT Mcog ) improve great extent measure symptomatology randomize non-CBT treatment ( CAT TAU ) patient Mcog improve great extent single modality CAT . Moreover , hypothesize patient treatment CAT component ( CAT Mcog ) improve great extent measure symptomatology randomize non-CAT treatment ( CBT TAU ) patient Mcog improve great extent single modality CAT . The potential public health implication promote recovery schizophrenia multi-modal treatment profound . By integrate effective treatment potential synergistic improvement scan assess . Home visit costly . Maximizing benefit patient provide multi-modal treatment home visit likely improve broad range outcomes minimal additional cost .</detailed_description>
