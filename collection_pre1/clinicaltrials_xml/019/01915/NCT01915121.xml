	<brief_summary>The study main objective enhance treatment decision make improve quality life post-treatment health care among patient diagnose invasive bladder cancer . Bladder cancer ( BL Ca ) 5th commonly diagnose cancer US . BL Ca common among men woman 90 % patient age 55 . Surgery remove bladder follow one three diversion technique ( i.e. , ileal conduit , continent reservoir , neobladder ) standard therapy follow invasive bladder cancer . The emotional , functional , physical , social impact invasive Bl Ca treatment patient ' QOL adjustment devastate . This impact significantly vary treatment option . Treatment decision make BL Ca difficult best potentially susceptible number cognitive affective factor ( e.g. , patient ' emotional reaction , value , expectation ) . Thus , addition adjust potential life-threatening disease , cope uncertainty efficacy outcomes different treatment option add overall distress may impair effective decision-making . In spite increase effort health communication patient education , study examine treatment decision making among invasive bladder patient provide educational intervention facilitate treatment decision making among population . To end , guide Self-Regulation theory ( SRT ) emphasize role cognitive emotional factor decision making , design pilot test acceptability preliminary educational training experiential intervention ( ETE ) address gap literature . The ETE intervention use new innovative educational strategy method educate patient treatment option facilitate treatment decision making .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study : 1 ) enhance design application ETE intervention , 2 ) provide data efficacy refine ETE intervention randomized-controlled study ( RCT ) . To achieve 2 goal , study divide 2 phase . PHASE 1 : To enhance refine design application preliminary ETE intervention : Aim 1-a : To explore knowledge , belief , value expectation treatment option , treatment decision making , quality life ( QOL ) among patient BL Ca . To achieve Aim 1-a Phase 1 , first step , 2 focus group ( FG ; N = 10 ) invasive BL Ca patient conduct ) examine knowledge , belief , value , expectation , affective response treatment option treatment decision making , b ) record difficulty problem post-surgical health care ( e.g. , use stoma appliance catheter ) , c ) explore concern patient live impact treatment . The ETE intervention refine base FG result . Aim 1-b : To explore patient ' acceptability refine ETE intervention . To achieve Aim 1-b Phase 1 , additional 2 FG ( FG ; N = 10 ) BL Ca survivor conduct solicit input design acceptability refine ETE intervention . PHASE 2 : Aim 2 . To assess efficacy ETE intervention small RCT To achieve Aim 2 Phase 2 , two-group RCT ( standard care ( SC ) plus time attention control condition , N = 62 patient ; SC plus ETE intervention N = 62 patient ) conduct examine efficacy ETE intervention . Phase 2 provide ) test efficacy refine ETE intervention reduce decisional conflict regret , improve QOL post-treatment stoma pouch care control potential clinical socio-demographic covariates ( e.g. , treatment type , age ) .</detailed_description>
