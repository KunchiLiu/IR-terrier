	<brief_summary>The single distressing symptom 70 % patient oesophageal cancer difficulty swallow ( dysphagia ) cause blockage gullet tumour . This cause severe restriction food intake , physical activity , social function overall quality life . Amongst effective treatment improve swallowing , insertion metal stent across blocked part , self-expands open gullet ( Self Expanding Metal Stent SEMS ) . The addition radiotherapy may help improve problem cause dysphagia provide additional survival benefit . The purpose study test impact add radiotherapy SEMS : - length time swallow remain improved - quality life - survival</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ROCS ( Radiotherapy After Oesophageal Cancer Stenting ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess impact radiotherapy addition self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) placement time progression patient-reported dysphagia patient population unable undergo surgery . Patients eligible take part trial oesophageal cancer , need SEMS dysphagia , age 16 year old , clinically assess able receive radiotherapy , expect survival least 12 week able give write informed consent . 496 patient randomise receive either SEMS alone SEMS radiotherapy . The radiotherapy give outpatient either five treatment ( one per day ) one week , ten treatment two week . Questionnaires complete treatment , week two four monthly one year ass quality life cost effectiveness . Interviews hold trial participant three time point explore experience trial . Interviews also hold patient consent take part trial explore reason non-consent . Treatments : Arm A : Self-expanding metal stent ( SEMS ) ( Control Arm ) SEMS insertion undertaken accordance standard local protocol . Covered partially cover metal stent use length type mode stent placement select clinician . Insertion occur within two week randomisation . Arm B : SEMS plus external beam radiotherapy ( Intervention Arm ) External beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) routinely available regional cancer centre across UK . For palliation dysphagia oesophageal cancer , radiotherapy course deliver tumour absorb dose 20Gy 5 fraction 30Gy 10 fraction within 4 week SEMS insertion . There also qualitative component trial two aim : ) explore feasibility patient ' recruitment trial ii ) explore participant ' experience trial intervention . It examine experience consent recruitment include reason decline , examine patient ' motivation accept randomisation intervention may include extra radiotherapy . This optional component require separate consent . Patients consent trial , consent qualitative component , interview reason not-consenting soon possible approach participate . Trial participant consent qualitative component interview three time : week one four capture initial decision-making thought intervention ( week 8 ) explore patient ' experience intervention perception benefit detriment .</detailed_description>
