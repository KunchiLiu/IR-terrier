	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis significant health problem old population affect least 40 % woman 15 % men age 50 year . Fracture lead increase morbidity mortality healthcare cost well predispose future fracture . Patients history low-energy fracture significantly increase risk fracture short-term . There universal consensus support high-quality randomize trial evidence secondary prevention : patient low-trauma fragility fracture BMD test would benefit anti-osteoporotic treatment There , unfortunately , also well-documented near-universal gap evidence-based best practice usual care patient fragility fracture . Although osteoporotic fracture indicate two- threefold increase risk future fracture , one five patient receive medical intervention sustain osteoporotic fracture . Diverse post fracture intervention develop improve osteoporosis diagnosis treatment : provide educational material patient and/or primary physician , use medical reminder , intensive intervention use osteoporosis case manager ( nurse , doctor ) fracture liaison service . effective post fracture intervention proactive , complex , time consuming , coordinator manager dependant , costly . Taking account cost human resource need , propose improve post fracture patient management use mobile telecommunication already use chronic disease management . There study use phone short message service ( SMS ) support field osteoporosis , especially post-fracture management : bone mineral density ( BMD ) screening , anti-osteoporotic treatment initiation monitoring improvement adherence . One limitation could use phone mobile old patient . We assess number mobile phone user among 100 consecutive subject hospitalize non vertebral fracture ( mean age 69.5 year ( 50-98 ) ; 58 woman 42 men ) Emergency department Cochin hospital : 61 % mobile phone use SMS ; 61 % mobile phone . We propose assess efficacy use SMS support improve screen initiation antiosteoporotic treatment patient low trauma non vertebral fracture , consult Emergency department . This study current care , monocentric , randomize , open . 170 patient follow 6 month . The group control receive usual recommendation make appointment realization bone densitometry . The SMS group receive 3 SMS ( 15 day , 5 week 3 month ) consult time consultation Emergency department , call 10 minute 6 month nurse . The result study important impact postfracture management field osteoporosis . Indeed , demonstrate use SMS improve BMD screen antiosteoporotic treatment initiation , plan assess large randomize control trial whether mobile phone communication decrease risk new fracture comparatively usual care patient low trauma fracture could use .</detailed_description>
