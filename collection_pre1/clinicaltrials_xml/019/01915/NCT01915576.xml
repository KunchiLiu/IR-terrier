	<brief_summary>This first study BAY1125976 give human . Patients ( comer ) receive study drug treatment dose-escalation scheme ( placebo group ) determine safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) BAY1125976 . The relative bioavailability liquid service formulation tablet determine . After MTD define breast cancer patient without AKT1 mutation treat . The study also assess pharmacokinetics , biomarker status , pharmacodynamic parameter tumor response BAY1125976 . BAY1125976 give daily single oral application . Treatment stop tumor continue grow , side effect , patient tolerate , occur patient decides exit treatment .</brief_summary>
