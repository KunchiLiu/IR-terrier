	<brief_summary>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) common monogenic heart disease frequent cause sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) young . It characterize unexplained leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , diffuse patchy fibrosis , myofibrillar disarray . While majority patient remain asymptomatic , prognosis poor subset present SCD progress heart failure ( HF ) . Current method predict risk adverse event target therapy limit . Current medical therapy protect SCD , prevent development HF . Therefore , identification novel risk marker would help develop therapeutic target aim alter phenotypic expression impact natural history , especially SCD HF . Cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) emerge powerful tool diagnosis risk stratification HCM include assessment LV mass pattern hypertrophy . Late gadolinium enhancement CMR marker focal myocardial fibrosis think underlie arrhythmogenic substrate well promote development HF . The investigator hypothesize HCM patient higher primary outcome event rate identify novel CMR finding . The majority case HCM autosomal dominant 60 % caused mutation gene encode cardiac sarcomeric protein . However , relationship genetic mutation , disease phenotype , clinical outcome remain poorly understood . The investigator hypothesize HCM patient sarcomeric HCM mutation higher primary outcome event rate mark myocardial pathology CMR without . Furthermore , may link sarcomeric mutation fibrosis , mutation carrier overt HCM well without hypertrophy elevate marker collagen turnover . The investigator therefore hypothesize serum biomarkers collagen metabolism HCM predict outcome . Thus , Specific Aim develop predictive model cardiovascular outcome HCM : 1 ) use exploratory data mining method identify demographic , clinical , novel CMR , genetic biomarker variable associate outcomes 2 ) develop score predictive model use ass risk give patient 's combination risk factor , thus establish evidence base enable clinical trial design reduce morbidity mortality HCM cost-effective manner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2.2 Rationale Presently use risk predictor HCM clinical outcome SCD HF still insufficient limit clinical trial institution novel therapy disease . This large scale , prospective clinical registry systematically answer important question whether , addition combination advance CMR phenotyping , genetic biomarker analysis , risk stratification HCM could substantially improve presently use clinical risk predictor . Emerging novel blood , genetic , CMR marker offer paradigm-shifting promise reliably identify risk . In addition , large genotyped population HCM available correlate comprehensive CMR biomarker evaluation . This allow unique opportunity evaluate genotype-phenotype correlation compare specific genetic subset manner possible past . This study also establish predictive model use ass risk give patient 's combination risk factor . This help select patient future clinical trial prevent SCD HF . In addition , identify surrogate endpoint monitor treatment response HCM . In way , evidence base establish HCM enable clinical trial design reduce morbidity mortality HCM cost-effective manner . 3 OBJECTIVES The Specific Aim study develop predictive model cardiovascular outcome hypertrophic cardiomyopathy : 1 ) use exploratory data mining method identify demographic , clinical , novel CMR , genetic biomarker variable associate outcomes 2 ) develop score predictive model use ass risk give patient 's combination risk factor , thus establish evidence base enable clinical trial design reduce morbidity mortality HCM cost-effective manner . To understand relationship novel risk marker HCM clinical outcome , investigator propose natural history study 2750 patient clinically diagnose HCM study baseline collection demographic data , clinical risk factor , well novel marker CMR , genotyping , serum biomarkers collagen turnover myocardial injury , enrol 2-year period follow 3-5 year ( mean 4 year ) . The study power identify risk marker Cox model ( image , serum , genetic beyond standard clinical risk factor ) hazard ratio 1.5 great primary endpoint , cardiac death ( include SCD HF death ) , abort SCD ( appropriate discharge implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ) , need heart transplantation . Secondary endpoint include all-cause mortality , ventricular tachyarrhythmias , hospitalization heart failure , atrial fibrillation , stroke . This study enable establishment predictive model help identify patient risk well patient future clinical trial prevent SCD HF . In addition , identify surrogate endpoint monitor treatment response HCM . 4 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Selection Study Population Patient characteristic : 2750 patient recruit include least 51 % female 30 % minority .

Laboratory Evaluations 5.1.1 Specimen Collection , Preparation , Handling Shipping Biomarker sample ( Full detail provide separate Biomarkers Technical Manual ) 1 . Collect 3 , 10 ml tube serum K3 EDTA plasma fast state ( indicated non-fasting fasting sample obtain ) DNA sample 1 . Collect one 10ml EDTA tube . 6 STUDY SCHEDULE 6.1 Screening Patient 's medical record review certain diagnosis eligibility . Informed consent must obtain member study team . 6.2 Baseline visit Initial visit schedule study procedure list # 5 . 6.3 Follow-up Visits Yearly telephone follow-up obtain 5 year review applicable hospital death record . Health status assess SF-12 time . 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 Study Outcome Measures The primary endpoint prospective study composite cardiac death ( SCD HF death ) , abort SCD include appropriate ICD firing , need heart transplantation . Secondary endpoint include all-cause mortality , ventricular tachyarrhythmias , hospitalization heart failure , atrial fibrillation , stroke . 10.2 Sample Size Considerations Assuming 3-year event rate 4.2 % base recently publish literature10 ; 11 ; 26 ; 27 alpha error rate 5 % , 2500 patient provide 90 % power detect hazard ratio 1.5 least one risk factor Cox model . An additional 250 ( 2750 total ) patient enrolled compensate project dropout rate 2 % per year . 10.3 Participant Enrollment Follow-Up 2750 enrollee , follow 5 year . 10.4 Analysis Plan Because anticipated event rate small ( 4-5 % ) , number potential predictive risk factor large ( 20+ ) , exploratory , tree classification analysis use identify strong predictor eliminate judge little predictive power . Based risk factor identify exploratory analysis , regression prediction model develop summary risk score HCM calculate easily use clinical setting . Tree-based data mining method use identify key variable prediction primary outcome , composite cardiac death ( SCD HF death ) , abort SCD include appropriate ICD firing , need heart transplantation . Secondary endpoint include all-cause mortality , ventricular tachyarrhythmias , septal myectomy alcohol ablation , hospitalization heart failure , atrial fibrillation , stroke . Tree-based model exploratory technique uncovering structure multivariate data28 ; 29 . It particularly useful derive prediction rule large number screen variable risk factor . Tree model use classification ( binary outcome ) regression ( continuous outcome ) . In either case , collection prediction rule ( predictor variable ) display form tree . The terminology mimic tree : root top node tree display mean ( regression ) proportion ( classification ) outcome entire sample . A split rule create new branch , leaf terminal node . Each node binary split predictor variable contains two sub-groups sample large possible difference group . The variable appear one level tree ( recursive partitioning ) . The advantage tree-based model linear additive model adept capture non-additive relationship easily uncover complex interaction predictor variable . Continuous variable categorical variable two level need dichotomize prior analysis - tree algorithm determine cutoff value produce homogenous node . Missing data treat separate category . Initial tree model include risk factor list follow table well demographic variable , age , sex , race . Clinical CMR Genetic Biomarkers Family history HCM-related SCD LV ejection fraction MYH7 NT-pro BNP Unexplained recent syncope LV mass/mass index MYBPC3 Singulex cardiac troponin Massive LVH ( wall thickness &gt; 30mm ) Maximum diastolic wall thickness Thin filament mutation PICP Multiiple burst nonsustained VT LGE extent ( % LV mass ) Compound/double heterozygotes ST2 Hypotensive BP response exercise Global extracellular volume fraction Sarcomere mutation negative The initial tree reduce size ( prune ) compare misclassification error rate small tree large tree assess reduction predictive ability tree result prune process . The goal identify strong predictor HCM , interaction predictor , eliminate factor little predictive power . While tree model give rapid identification strong predictor combination predictor , usually result clinically useful prediction model generalize well patient setting . Regression method , use test-validation re-sampling procedure , use develop valid model possible . Using demographic , clinical , image , biomarker genetic measure , plus interaction , identify tree analysis , Cox proportional hazard regression use develop predictive model summary risk score calculate applied clinical setting . Parametric regression method may use proportional hazard assumption meet . The regression model develop use 100-fold validation procedure whereby 50 % observation randomly select model development ( test sample ) remain 50 % use assess model 's predictive ability ( validation sample ) . This procedure repeat 100 time different random selection test-validation sample iteration . The c-index calculate assess model discrimination test validation samples30 . The ensemble test-validation model provide estimate attenuation c-index model apply different sample well consistency specific risk factor appear model . A final model construct include combination strongest ( high c-index frequency appearance ) predictor . This model apply entire sample estimate regression coefficient hazard ratio calculate summary risk score30 . Nomograms construct final model provide predict probability risk score . To increase ease use nomogram , variable statistically significant little effect prediction may exclude . The model also use develop prediction algorithm rapidly calculate risk hand-held electronic device . This analysis may also inform design clinical trial evaluate therapeutic efficacy provide effect size ( hazard ratio ) calculate sample size requirement .</detailed_description>
