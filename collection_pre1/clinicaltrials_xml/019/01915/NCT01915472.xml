	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial study safety efficacy IMMU-130 . IMMU-130 compose drug attach antibody . The drug active ingredient irinotecan common chemotherapy drug use colorectal cancer . Antibodies proteins normally make immune system . They bind substance n't belong body prevent harm body . The antibody study design bind marker locate colorectal cancer tumor . The antibody originally make mouse protein , change laboratory like human antibody . This study investigate IMMU-130 act treatment colorectal cancer .

	<criteria>Male female patient , ≥ 18 year age , able understand give write informed consent Histologically cytologically confirm colorectal adenocarcinoma Stage IV ( metastatic ) disease Previously treat least one prior irinotecancontaining regimen colorectal cancer Adequate performance status ( ECOG 0 1 ) ( Appendix 1 ) Expected survival ≥ 6 month CEA plasma level &gt; 5 ng/mL Measurable disease CT MRI , single lesion measure 10.0 cm At least 4 week beyond treatment ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy ) major surgery recover acute toxicity Adequate hematology without ongoing transfusional support ( hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL , ANC ≥ 1,500 per mm3 , platelet &gt; 100,000 per mm3 ) Adequate renal hepatic function ( creatinine ≤ 1.5 x IULN , bilirubin within normal limit , AST ALT ≤ 3.0 x IULN 5 x IULN know liver metastasis ) Otherwise , acute toxicity study entry ≤ Grade 1 NCI CTC v4.0 , recover baseline Women pregnant lactating . Women childbearing potential fertile men unwilling use effective contraception study conclusion 12week posttreatment evaluation period . Patients Gilbert 's disease know CNS metastatic disease . However , patient CNS metastases asymptomatic complete course therapy eligible study provide clinically stable 1 month prior entry define : ( 1 ) evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis , ( 2 ) steroid stable dose steroid . Patients CEA plasma level &gt; 1000 ng/mL must approve advance Sponsor . Patients active ≥ Grade 3 anorexia , nausea vomiting , and/or sign intestinal obstruction . Patients nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix eligible , patient prior malignancy must least 3year diseasefree interval , deem low risk recurrence his/her treat physician . Patients know HIV positive , hepatitis B positive , hepatitis C positive . Known history unstable angina , MI , CHF present within 6 month clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ( stable atrial fibrillation ) require antiarrhythmia therapy . Known history clinically significant active COPD , moderatetosevere chronic respiratory illness present within 6 month . Infection require intravenous antibiotic use within 1 week . Other concurrent medical psychiatric condition , Investigator 's opinion , may likely confound study interpretation prevent completion study procedure followup examination .</criteria>
