	<brief_summary>This prospective , single center , observational study . Patients require Peripheral Inserted Central Catheters ( PICC ) constitute study population . The purpose study determine whether Sherlock 3CG , adequate mean total placement PICC confirmation tip PICC placement method conduct safely efficiently . Patients include 6-month period well ambulatory hospitalize . The patient 's routine care modify PICC assess present study . PICC placement perform use Site Rite guidance tip position confirm use Sherlock 3CG . The procedure routine habit operator ( nurse anesthesiologist ) ; vascular access team already use previous device CVC placement . Patients wo n't follow study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Placement Confirmation Peripheral Inserted Central Catheters Tip Position Using New Electrocardiographic Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our current Central Venous Catheter placement protocol PICC include resort UltraSonography ( US ) require fluoroscopy plain radiography throughout PICC insertion confirmation best placement . This verification mandatory avoid risk , delay cost reposition tip , obtain fluoroscopy plain radiography operate room time consume expose patient , nurse physicians radiation . The use endocavitary electrocardiogram tip position confirmation develop since 1985 recognize alternative method . It recognize best technique indication , hemodialysis . It help position PICC tip proximity cavoatrial junction . In Europe , Italian German team already use new method . A new ultrasound machine offering external sensor Endocavitary ECG guide available ( Site Rite Sherlock 3CG - Tip Confirmation System ) , allow installation proper placement operation . This Sherlock 3CG TCS already approve Food Drug Administration US indicate PICC tip placement confirmation adult patient . This new ECG guidance method allow PICC insertion without radiation operating room . For moment , accord local recommendation , French patient continue perform one post-procedural X-ray confirm tip position . This exam perform dedicated room radiology unit . But guidance confirmation CVC placement ECG may provide fast mean confirmation eliminate radiation exposure patient , nurse anesthesiologist . In addition , would eliminate cost associated confirmatory chest X-ray ( exam cost time consumption ) .</detailed_description>
