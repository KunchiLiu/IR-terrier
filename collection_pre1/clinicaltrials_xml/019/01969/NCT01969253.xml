	<brief_summary>Over past year , several study make various outcome incidence lymphedema . Because outcome come differently study measurement , criterion , treatment period , treatment method morbid extremities lymphedema . Therefore required understanding incidence , risk factor physical progress treat prevented lymphedema . Also necessary understand characteristic lymphedema measurement establish diagnostic criterion lymphedema comparative study . The aim study analyze incidence risk factor lymphedema prospectively observation , determine effect quality life lymphedema breast cancer surgery ALND .</brief_summary>
