	<brief_summary>This study determine efficacy momelotinib ( MMB ) versus ruxolitinib participant primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) post-polycythemia vera post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis ( post-PV/ET MF ) yet receive treatment Janus kinase inhibitor ( JAK inhibitor ) . Participants randomize receive either MMB ruxolitinib 24 week double-blind treatment phase , eligible receive open-label MMB additional 168 week . After discontinuation study medication , assessment continue 12 additional week , participant contact survival follow-up approximately every 6 month 5 year date enrollment .</brief_summary>
