	<brief_summary>Surgical resident fellows acquire operative knowledge skill assist attend surgeon operate room . Previous research show practise technical skill prior operate patient improve skillfully laparoscopic surgery perform . Although increasingly large number patient undergoing robotic hysterectomy robotic surgical procedure , little known ensure patient safety treatment effectiveness trainee surgeon participate operating room . Our study aim determine impact immediate preoperative warm-up robotic surgery simulator gynecologic surgical trainee intraoperative performance patient outcomes . The investigator randomly assign gynecologic surgical trainee major academic medical center either warm-up immediately surgery robotic surgery simulator warm-up . The attend surgeon supervise trainee operating room unaware whether trainee assign warm-up warm-up . The investigator compare standard robotic surgical skill assessment trainee supervise attend surgeon patient outcomes two group .</brief_summary>
