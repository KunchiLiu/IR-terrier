	<detailed_description>Background . In United States , 8 million patient require emergency department evaluation acute chest pain every year . The estimated cost evaluation &gt; $ 10 billion loss economic productivity likely far great . Multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) popular alternative diagnostic invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) ( Deetjen , et al . 2007 , Schroeder , et al . 2008 , de Roos 2010 ) gain wide clinical acceptance ability rule significant coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( Hulten , Bittencourt , Ghoshhajra Blankstein 2012 ) . However , patient acute chest pain , abnormal CT coronary angiography ( CTCA ) find frequently result additional nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) determine hemodynamic significance coronary stenosis ( Garcia , Lessick Hoffmann 2006 , Deetjen , et al . 2007 , Miller , et al . 2008 , Schroeder , et al . 2008 , de Roos 2010 ) . This presence extent myocardial ischemia important severity coronary stenosis identifying patient would benefit coronary revascularization . Accordingly , grow interest simultaneous evaluation coronary anatomy hemodynamic significance CAD single test , study focus potential MDCT ass myocardial perfusion ( Techasith Cury 2011 ) . One hurdle approach need overcome relies visual assessment manually select 2D slice , rather 3D analysis entire myocardium , require manual adjustment contrast window , carry risk miss subendocardial perfusion defect . Prior data hypothesis . To overcome limitation , recently develop technique quantitative 3D analysis myocardial perfusion , use distribution x-ray attenuation calculate myocardial segment index severity extent perfusion abnormality ( Kachenoura , et al . 2010 ) . Having confirm ability analysis detect regadenoson-induced perfusion abnormality consecutive patient refer CTCA ( Mor-Avi , et al . 2012 ) , propose new study aim determine value methodology patient present emergency department acute chest pain . We select cohort validate CT perfusion analysis determine whether provide additive utility CTCA alone , patient increasingly refer emergency department CTCA large number , instead nuclear vasodilator stress testing , thus lose valuable physiologic information . Because perfusion index specifically design take account fact stress-induced perfusion defect subendocardial , hypothesize quantitative 3D analysis accurately identify patient present emergency department acute chest pain due underlie hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis , aid identification individual likely benefit revascularization , thus improve ability predict patient outcome . Indeed , previous study show regadenoson , perfusion index 2-3 time higher myocardial segment supply artery significant stenosis ( Patel , et al . 2011 ) , thus improve diagnosis hemodynamically significant CAD . Aims . This study design achieve follow goal : ( 1 ) test hypothesis compare stress MDCT perfusion data invasive fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) data patient significant stenosis undergo ICA ; ( 2 ) determine add value MDCT perfusion adjunct CTCA predict patient outcome . Study design . In study , MDCT image perform regadenoson stress approximately 300 consecutive patient acute chest pain refer emergency department CTCA , agree undergo additional MDCT imaging vasodilator stress . Patients contraindication CTCA , include know allergy iodine , renal dysfunction ( creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ) , inability perform 10 sec breath-hold , contraindication beta-blockers regadenoson , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , advanced heart block systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg , exclude study . In addition , patient history cardiothoracic surgery pacemaker coronary stent implantation exclude . Myocardial perfusion assess use quantitative volumetric analysis , report refer physician order avoid referral bias . In patient , collect follow information time enrollment : age , gender , height , weight , blood pressure , tobacco use , history heart disease , hypertension , stroke diabetes . In addition , blood sample obtain allow analysis lipid cardiac enzyme . In subgroup patient also undergo ICA , MDCT perfusion compare ICA finding , include degree stenosis FFR . Enrollment stop 30 patient ICA data enrol ( base power analysis ) . All study patient follow determine predictive value MDCT perfusion major cardiovascular event 1 moth 1 year presentation . MDCT image protocol . Beta-blocker metoprolol give orally ( 50 mg , 1 hr prior image ) and/or intravenously ( 5 15 mg immediately prior imaging ) , necessary achieve target heart rate &lt; 70 bpm . Images acquire suspend respiration ( 256-channel iCT scanner , Philips ) . Initially , CTCA perform rest accord standard clinical protocol . Then , regadenoson ( Lexiscan , Astellas ) administer ( 0.4mg , i.v . bolus ) least 15 minute later ensure contrast clearance . An additional set image acquire 1 minute administration regadenoson ensure image peak vasodilator effect . Stress image acquire follow injection 50 ml iodinate contrast rate 4 ml/sec , use prospective gating , order minimize radiation exposure , result average 2 mSv additional stress scan . MDCT image analysis . Myocardial perfusion analyze rest vasodilator stress . Following manual initialization endo- epicardial boundary 5 6 slice , endo- epicardial 3D surface automatically estimate use level-set technique ( Corsi , et al . 2005 ) . The 3D region interest confine endocardial epicardial surface identify LV myocardium divide 3D wedge-shaped myocardial segment , accord standard AHA segmentation ( Cerqueira , et al . 2002 ) : 6 basal , 6 mid-ventricular , 4 apical segment . For myocardial segment , mean x-ray attenuation value automatically measure Hounsfeld unit ( HU ) . Then x-ray attenuation LV slice base apex use describe previously ( Kachenoura , et al . 2010 ) generate bull 's eye display myocardial attenuation normalize mean LV cavity attenuation , resemble MPI bull 's eye . Unlike previous study fix perfusion defect ( Kachenoura , et al . 2010 ) , bull 's eye display transmural attenuation , study also create bull 's eye subendocardial attenuation optimize visualization stress-induced subendocardial perfusion defect . In addition bull 's eye display subendocardial attenuation , information map onto reconstruct 3D-rendered endocardial surface facilitate appreciation location extent perfusion abnormality . This 3D display allow manually rotate model allow visualization angle , provide realistic view hypoenhanced area less distortion bull 's eye . Finally , myocardial segment , quantitative index extent severity perfusion abnormality , Qh , calculate mathematical product number voxels low attenuation percent total volume segment , reflect extent defect , difference attenuation voxels previously determine normal attenuation anatomic location , reflect severity defect ( Kachenoura , et al . 2010 ) . Objective detection perfusion abnormality . To allow objective detection perfusion abnormality , data collect earlier pilot study use determine abnormality cutoff value perfusion index Qh . Myocardial segment divide two group accord CTCA finding : segment supply coronary artery stenosis locate proximally specific segment cause &gt; 50 % luminal narrowing CTCA , segment supply artery without significant stenosis stenosis locate distally segment . Receiver operator curve ( ROC ) analysis use determine optimal abnormality threshold index Qh rest stress . We use threshold plan prospective study objectively classify segmental myocardial perfusion normal abnormal . Segments Qh correspond threshold consider abnormal . A territory individual coronary artery consider abnormal perfusion index abnormal least one segment . For patient-by-patient analysis , abnormal perfusion diagnose least one territory abnormal . Inter-technique comparison . In order allow comparison MDCT perfusion ICA finding , coronary anatomy depict patient 's MDCT volume render heart use determine perfusion territory artery major branch , i.e . assign myocardial segment territory specific coronary artery . This allow u predict normal abnormal perfusion segment base ICA determination presence , location severity stenosis . Significant stenosis define 50 % separately 70 % decrease luminal cross-sectional area . Comparisons ICA perform perfusion index Qh , also adjunct CTCA finding , i.e . percent luminal narrowing FFR . All inter-technique comparison perform segment-by-segment , vascular territory patient-by-patient basis . Inter-technique agreement assess calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value ( PPV , NPV ) overall accuracy respective reference standard . The accuracy MDCT perfusion combine CTCA finding compare CTCA alone determine add clinical value MDCT perfusion data . Patient follow-up . Patients enrol study follow minimum 1 year stress test major adverse cardiovascular event , include coronary revascularization , hospitalization unstable angina , myocardial infarction death . This information obtain patient ' medical record , Social Security Death Index , phone call patient ' home . The collected follow-up data use determine prevalence adverse event patient coronary stenosis &gt; 50 % abnormal perfusion , compare remain patient ( chi-square test ) . The follow-up data also use study ability regadenoson-induced perfusion abnormality detect MDCT image predict event-free survival . This achieved univariate logistic regression analysis , follow multivariate regression variable find predict outcome univariate regression . The predictive value combination stenosis CTCA perfusion defect compare conventional marker , percent coronary luminal narrowing CTCA alone , cardiac enzyme , TIMI risk score . Finally , determine whether combination conventional marker MDCT-derived perfusion data would predict patient outcomes well either one alone . Anticipated result . We anticipate perfusion abnormality detect MDCT image correlate finding ICA , add CTCA finding , improve accuracy MDCT evaluation CAD compare reference standard . In addition , anticipate add conventional marker , cardiac enzyme TIMI risk score , vasodilator stress induce MDCT perfusion abnormality predict adverse cardiovascular event well traditional index alone . Innovation significance . To knowledge , first study validate ICA reference quantitative 3D evaluation myocardial perfusion MDCT image obtain vasodilator stress patient refer CTCA evaluation acute chest pain . These patient increasingly refer CTCA large number , instead nuclear vasodilator stress testing , thus lose valuable physiologic information . Because addition stress perfusion allow elucidate impact coronary lesion test , addition promise improve diagnostic performance cardiac CT evaluation acute chest pain . This methodology may prove single-stop alternative costly serial testing . Moreover , comprehensive approach proven well predict patient outcome compare current clinical algorithm , may become new tool risk stratification plan individual patient 's treatment . We anticipate result study support use methodology every patient chest pain refer CTCA , similar routine use vasodilator stress MPI .</detailed_description>
