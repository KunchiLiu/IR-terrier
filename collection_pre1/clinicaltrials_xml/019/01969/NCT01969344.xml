	<brief_summary>The purpose SPIROMICS learn chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , sometimes call emphysema chronic bronchitis . Millions Americans COPD , fourth lead cause death country . The common cause COPD cigarette smoking , although smoker get COPD . The discovery new treatment COPD slow poor understanding different type COPD lack way measure whether COPD get bad . The study two main goal . The first find group patient COPD share certain characteristic . Certain group may respond differently certain treatment . The second find new way measure whether COPD get bad . This would provide new way test whether new treatment work . SPIROMICS three substudies two ancillary study . Substudies : 1 . Repeatability Substudy : The entire baseline clinic visit repeat 100 volunteer . The goal substudy determine reliability measurement procedure . 2 . Bronchoscopy Substudy : 300 participant enrol two additional study visit , include bronchoscopy . The goal substudy collect assess biological specimen relate result clinical measurement . 3 . Exacerbation Substudy : Up 400 participant enrol substudy . A daily symptom diary collect participant . Participants also see clinic pulmonary exacerbation . The goal substudy 1 ) good understand relationship symptoms exacerbation 2 ) obtain clinical data specimen pulmonary exacerbation . Ancillary Studies : 1 . Air Pollution Ancillary Study : The SPIROMICS Air Pollution ancillary study use state-of-the art air pollution exposure assessment determine individual-level outdoor indoor air pollution exposure . The goal substudy determine effect long-term air pollution exposure COPD morbidity determine whether short-term change outdoor air pollution associate change COPD morbidity . 2 . Parametric Response Mapping COPD : The Parametric Response Mapping ( PRM ) COPD ancillary study collect additional CT scan final study visit use new analysis technique ( PRM ) assess functional small airway lung emphysema .</brief_summary>
