	<brief_summary>Despite best medical therapy many people emphysema remain breathless limited daily activity . In emphysema lung empty properly person breathes . This `` gas trapping '' make hard breathe . Endobronchial valve placement , treatment stop air get worst affect part lung stop trap gas , improve lung function , breathlessness exercise capacity select patient severe COPD ( chronic obstructive airway disease , sometimes referred emphysema ) . We want see people less severe COPD breathless benefit treatment . The treatment involve place small valve airway use fibre optic camera ( bronchoscopy ) . Bronchoscopy standard clinical procedure carry department .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common condition affect million adult worldwide prevalence burden project increase come decade . This projected increase explain ongoing exposure cigarette smoke COPD risk factor , particularly develop world , along population demographic change increase life expectancy . The Global Burden Disease Study predict 2020 COPD rank 5th behind ischaemic heart disease , depression , road traffic accident cerebrovascular disease cause disability-adjusted life year lost1 . The UK population prevalence clinically significant COPD estimate 1.7 % men 1.4 % woman . Emphysema debilitate illness result death . The damage alveolus lose elasticity , loss structural element lead collapse terminal bronchiole expiration . This lead gas trap hyperinflation . In severe case , alveolar wall become destroyed create bullae collateral ventilation . Overinflated area lung may compress adjacent lung tissue reduce perfusion ventilation healthy tissue . Because principal defect emphysema hyperinflation owe destruction elastic tissue lung , usual medical therapy target alleviate dyspnoea provide limit benefit compare patient form COPD . Therefore , non-pharmacological method palliate dyspnoea patient group develop , specifically lung volume reduction procedure . Lung volume reduction improve function return normal respiratory muscle shape function , also improve elastic recoil lung turn increase outward pull bronchiole . This reduce terminal bronchiole collapse improve expiratory airflow thereby reduce gas trapping . The decrease functional residual capacity improve diaphragmatic intercostal muscle function reduces work breathe . In carefully select patient , lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) clearly show effective improving outcomes . It , however , associate significant morbidity , 5 % mortality rate modest cost-benefit return . Unfortunately , small minority patient emphysema fit enough undergo major surgery , therefore variety alternative less invasive technique develop achieve lung volume reduction . These technique include insertion unidirectional endobronchial valve ( EBVs ) , lung volume reduction coil ( RePneu© ) internally compress hyperinflated emphysematous area lung , injection sclerosant material induce scar fibrosis damage portion lung . Endobronchial valve work allow air expel treat area lung expiration whilst prevent inspiratory airflow , subsequent collapse distal lung . This result volume loss allow reinflation healthier lung tissue improve ventilation-perfusion matching . The Zephyr Valve ( PulmonX , Redwood City , CA , USA ) allow exhale air secretion expel around valve prevent ventilation distal lung . It implant use flexible bronchoscope conscious sedation day case procedure . The Valves Emphysema palliatioN Trial ( VENT ) large randomise controlled trial valve publish date . Endobronchial valve place diseased lobe achieve unilateral occlusion . This trial together European counterpart , EuroVENT , demonstrate significant improvement lung function , exercise capacity , quality life could achieve . Endobronchial valve insertion appear safe commonly report complication COPD exacerbation small volume haemoptysis . Pneumothoraces significant complication report rate 5 % study , although true rate clinical practice correctly choose patient likely near 20 % ( significant proportion patient trial complete fissure , therefore would expect significant volume loss hence pneumothorax ) . Endobronchial valve easily remove need arise . The criteria patient selection currently specific , limiting procedure small subgroup patient emphysema - specifically FEV1 &lt; 45 % . However , aim EBV therapy reduce hyperinflation deflate disease area lung , result improved respiratory mechanic great inspiratory capacity , rather correct airflow obstruction . In spite significant reduction amount trap gas , residual volume ( RV ) , lungs patient treated EBVs , patient see modest improvement functional outcome 6 minute walk test . Airflow limitation alone cause reduction exercise capacity , may limit treat patient even face reduction RV . Therefore , patient severe hyperinflation limit breathlessness ( MRC dyspnoea score 3/5 great ) relatively well preserve FEV1 might expect derive great benefit term functional patient report outcomes limited airflow obstruction procedure .</detailed_description>
