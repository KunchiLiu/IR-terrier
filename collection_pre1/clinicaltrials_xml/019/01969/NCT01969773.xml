	<detailed_description>Background : Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) debilitate chronic disease unknown etiology . Current treatment usually unsuccessful completely eradicate bladder pain increase bladder capacity . Although investigation topic enthusiastically perform , etiology IC/PBS remain unknown . Treatment base single pathophysiology urothelial damage neurogenic inflammation might enough eradicate cascade pathology IC/PBS . Inhibition neuroplasticity sensory fiber suburothelial space intravesical BoNT-A injection might good therapeutic target pain sensory urgency patient IC/PBS . In recent basic research , BoNT-A show inhibit release acetylcholine norepinephrine , also nerve growth factor , adenosine triphosphate , substance P calcitonin gene-related peptide nerve fiber urothelium . This study design multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial test actual therapeutic effect intravesical BoNT-A injection IC/PBS . The result study might provide clinical evidence well therapeutic regimen treatment IC/PBS . Materials Methods : A total 90 patient IC/PBS fail conventional treatment least 6 month enrol study . A diagnosis IC/PBS establish base characteristic symptom cystoscopic finding glomerulations , petechia , mucosal fissure hydrodistention . They investigate thoroughly enrollment exclude meeting inclusion criterion National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) . However , study patient Hunner 's ulcer include previous study show ulcer type IC/PBS respond intravesical BoNT-A injection . A 3-day voiding diary functional bladder capacity , urinary frequency nocturnal , O'Leary-Sant symptom problem index , visual analog score ( VAS ) , videourodynamic parameter potassium chloride ( KCl ) sensitivity test use assess therapeutic efficacy . Patients inform possible complication associate BoNT-A injection generalize muscle weakness , difficult urination , transient urinary retention , urinary tract infection . Eligible patient randomly assign receive intravesical injection 100U BoNT-A ( BOTOX , Allergan , Irvine , CA , USA ) ( treatment group ) injection normal saline ( control group ) . The intravesical injection perform immediately follow cystoscopic hydrodistention intravenous general anesthesia operation room . Blood ( 10ml ) urine sample ( 30ml ) collect intravesical injection bladder hydrodistention . Bladder wall biopsy also perform hydrodistention . The patient allocate treatment control group permute block randomization code 2:1 ratio , centrally control clinical pharmacist prepares solution injection . Each vial BoNT-A dilute 10 ml normal saline , result 10U BoNT-A per 1.0 ml . Patients receive 20 suburothelial injection BoNT-A solution normal saline , injection site receive 5U saline 0.5 ml . After BoNT-A injection , patient follow outpatient clinic 2 week 4 week later . Then patient follow out-patient clinic 2 week , 4 week 12 week . The primary end-point study reduction bladder pain 12-week follow-up . If patient reduction VAS pain score 2 , consider successfully treat . The treatment outcome also assess global response assessment ( GRA ) evaluate overall perception treatment result . The result consider excellent patient report improvement GRA &gt; 2 patient become free bladder pain ( VAS=0 ) . Data compare treatment placebo group . A p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Cystoscopy bladder biopsy perform sent pathological examination urological laboratory investigation . The urine serum biomarkers ( NGF ) urothelial dysfunction marker ( TUNEL apoptosis , Ki-67 proliferation , tryptase stain mast cell activity , E-cadherin zonula occludens-1 junction protein expression ) assess investigate severity urothelial dysfunction chronic inflammation present diseased bladder . Furthermore , inflammatory protein assay TNFα , IL-6 , IL-8 TGF-beta also measure protein array western blotting . The urine blood sample collect baseline , 4 week , end-point ( 12 week ) treatment control patient . The change urine serum nerve growth factor ( NGF ) cytokine ( IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha ) compare within group group provide laboratory evidence decrease bladder inflammation IC/PBS . The change NGF cytokine level BoNT-A injection treatment also compare patient respond respond treatment give . Urinary serum NGF cytokine level measure ELISA method . Expected Results : The result study may demonstrate intravesical injection BoNT-A well clinical effect provide great pain relief increase bladder capacity patient IC/PBS compare patient receive saline injection treatment . The clinical effect BoNT-A IC/PBS might reflect reduction serum urinary NGF cytokine level .</detailed_description>
