	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : All patient health care proxy must sign informed consent consistent International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline prior participation trial . Male female patient , 40 year age old Patients must preadmission/preventilation diagnosis obstructive lung disease ( emphysema , chronic bronchitis , asthma , combination thereof ) , history treatment inhale bronchodilator . Note availability prior confirmatory spirometry desirable require participation trial Patients must clinically relevant acceptable elective semielective indication intubation initiation mechanical ventilation prior consideration trial enrollment . Exclusion criterion : Patients disease , respiratory nonrespiratory , sufficiently unstable ( beyond need intubation routine mechanical ventilation ) condition , opinion investigator ( ) put risk participation study , ( ii ) influence result study [ include assessment pharmacokinetic parameter ] , ( iii ) cause concern regard ability participate study duration one ( nominal ) day . Patients follow specific condition : Any systemic respiratory condition degree instability judgment principal investigator render patient unlikely safely participate complete study . Investigators encourage contact trial clinical monitor team member medicine question suitability particular patient study . A diagnosis thyrotoxicosis ( due know class side effect profile ß2agonists ) A diagnosis paroxysmal tachycardia ( &gt; 100 beat per minute ) ( due know class side effect profile ß2agonists ) Active/unstable cardiac ischemia Unstable lifethreatening cardiac arrhythmia Unstable heart failure ( typically Class III IV ) Renal and/or hepatic failure extent likely significantly affect drug metabolism consequent effect determination pharmacokinetic parameter determine investigator . Known active tuberculosis Currently treatment chemotherapy radiation therapy malignancy . Patients take investigational drug within one month six half life ( whichever great ) prior screen . ( Note purpose trial , commercially available previously prescribed/administered Combivent Respimat® Combivent Metered Dose Inhaler ( MDI ) preclude `` investigational '' . ) Patients know hypersensitivity ßadrenergics drug , anticholinergic drug , Benzalkonium chloride ( BAC ) , Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , component Respimat® inhalation solution delivery system Pregnant nursing woman Women childbearing potential use two effective method birth control ( one barrier one nonbarrier ) . Female patient consider childbearing potential unless surgically sterilize hysterectomy bilateral tubal ligation , postmenopausal least two years.However , subject study sedate , mechanical ventilation life support 24/7 continuous observation critical care setting , use additional birth control study period applicable . Patients currently participate another study . Note patient previously enter study test one two adapter eligible reentry trial study alternate adapter ( minimum 48 hour post completion `` active '' portion trial first adapter ) , inclusion exclusion criterion meet .</criteria>
