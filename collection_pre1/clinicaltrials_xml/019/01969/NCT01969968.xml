	<brief_title>Lipophilic Organic Polluants Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>I- Goals Because exponential prevalence co-morbidities , obesity , particularly massive form , become public health problem . It likely epidemic secondary genetic behavioural factor , also environmental factor . Specifically , `` obesogen '' `` diabetogen '' role several persistant organic polluants ( POP ) know endocrine disruptors use farm industry recently suggest experimental animal study human epidemiologic study . Those chemical usually lipophilic , store adipose tissue bio-accumulate , release blood stream lipolysis occur weight loss . This weight loss particularly rapid important bariatric surgery , propose treatment morbid obesity usually leading improvement insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome , diabetes . However , improvement constant , less important would anticipate massive weight loss observe . This raise question importance deleterious impact blood release lipophilic POPs evolution metabolic syndrome low grade associate inflammation . In prospective , multicentric study , propose analyse kinetic release several POPs rapid massive weight loss obtain bariatric surgery . Those POPs choose obesogen diabetogen property , report vitro vivo , lipophilic nature , ubiquitous presence home environment and/or food chain : bisphenol A ( plastic ) ; tributyltin ( fungicide , anti-fouling agent thermic stabilizant ) ; polybrominated diphenyl ether ( PBDE , fire retardant ) ; perchlorated octano√Ød acid sulphated compound ( PFOA PFOS , perfluoroalkyls use surfactant , lubrifiants , usted wrapping ) ; organochorinated compound : PCB153 , represent polychlorinated bisphenyls ( electric isolation ) ; hexachlorobenzene ( HBC ) , several pesticide : DDE , metabolite DDT , ban long half life , hexachlorocyclohexane ( HCH ) , heptachlor , nanochlor chlordane use agriculture . II- Originality /or new aspect project Though suggest several experimental study , role POP human obesity remain largely unknown . There paper role human POPs select , support animal experimental study . The concept release blood stream weight loss recent deserves study . III- Reasons choice question ( 3 maximum ) Interest results/method improve knowledge question 1 . To study kinetics release bariatric surgery select polluants store adipose tissue , look clinical and/or predictive factor 2 . To test hypothesis deleterious effect release expect improvement insulin-resistance liver inflammation . 3 . To determine level contamination morbidly obese patient , without metabolic syndrome , compare control , non obese population , special attention clinical ( age , gender , reproductive history , pregnancy , nursing ) biological parameter ( insulin-resistance , inflammation ) . IV- Description methods/ Calendar The POPs measure serum , urine ( BPA ) adipose tissue ( subcutaneous visceral ) gas chromatography couple mass spectrometry . Fat mass estimate possible DEXA ( weight &lt; 150 kg ) , impedancemetry , allow calculation estimate total body burden POP ( since lipophilic , multiply concentration chemical adipose tissue express ng/g fat total estimate body mass fat ) . The number patient include 250 morbidly obese adult , without metabolic syndrome ( 3 5 classical criterion ) , eligible bariatric surgery ( 125 Nice undergo gastric bypass , 125 Montpellier undergoing sleeve gastrectomy ) . Concentrations polluants measure baseline 3 , 6 12 month bariatric surgery , 18 month well patient undergo abdominoplasty require massive weight loss . Baseline concentration obese patient compare measure 100 control , match age gender , BMI &lt; 25 . Insulin resistance assess HOMA-IR , adiponectine SHBG , inflammation u CRP , leptin , interleukin 6 , TNF alpha , transaminase , gammaGT , alkalin phosphatase . The redistribution POPs serum adipose tissue , estimation total body burden assess surgery .</detailed_description>
