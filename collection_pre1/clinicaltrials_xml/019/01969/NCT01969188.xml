	<brief_summary>Spondyloarthritis refers set inflammatory disorder mainly afflict spine , joint ligament . A subtype spondyloarthritis Ankylosing Spondylitis - know axial spondyloarthropathy - characterize inflammation joint spinal column , part back spine meet pelvis . Another subtype spondyloarthritis Psoriatic Arthritis patient often develop raise patch redden skin . The disease advance one joint body result pain , swell stiffness . These form inflammatory arthritis become chronic time lead pain , disability deformity . There evidence patient inflammatory arthritis diagnose treat earlier course symptom may better result . Yet although know early treatment important , investigator still n't know factor predict individual patient 's disease progress time term lose mobility . The investigator also know relationship loosing mobility formation bone around spine joint . The investigator study investigator want learn patient form arthritis - Ankylosing Spondylitis Psoriatic Arthritis . The investigator want learn factor predict disease might progress time response treatment might . The investigator would also like determine proportion patient type symptom describe best treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Novel Immune Modulating Biomarkers Patients With Spondyloarthritis With Axial Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The condition study Spondyloarthritis ( SpA ) . The investigator gather cohort patient variant SpA ( n = 70 ) , include Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) Psoriatic Arthritis ( PsA ) axial disease fully characterize disease activity . Care guideline suggest patient see least twice within first year annual visit thereafter . Radiographs desirable ass disease progression , always require . Treatment option PsA AS patient include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , steroid injection , disease modify anti rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) biologics ( i.e . tumor necrosis factor inhibitor aka TNF inhibitor TNFi 's ) . The cohort patient eligible enrollment study would patient precede 6 week receive biologic treatment infliximab , precede 4 week receive biologic treatment adalimumab , etanercept , golimumab , certolizumab pegol biologic therapy . Subjects evaluate 4 time two year : enrollment , 24 week , 52 week 104 week ( 12 week window around visit ) . Usual care patient SpA would include regular assessment pain , function mobility , assessment spine joint motion , joint swell tenderness treatment change follow visit reduce pain , improve function , address adverse event medication enhance spinal mobility . Interventions might include physical therapy , analgesic , NSAIDs , DMARDs biologic therapy . The investigator would assign specific intervention subject study . All would record . Specific clinical information gather visit use validate index data collection instrument , include disease activity [ use Bath AS Disease Activity Index ( BASDAI ) Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score ( ASDAS ) ] , function ( use Bath AS Functional Index ( BASFI ) , measure joint/ligament involvement , measure tender swell joint count , dactylitis , enthesitis ( quantified use Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium Canada ( SPARCC ) enthesitis index spine involvement ( measure range movement spine hip use Bath AS Metrology Index ( BASMI ) .</detailed_description>
