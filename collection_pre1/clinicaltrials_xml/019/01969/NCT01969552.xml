	<brief_summary>TSH play central role current thyroid function test diagnostic tool therapeutic target . Recent study suggest complex hierarchical relationship logTSH FT4 entire functional spectrum widely assume single log linear gradient ( 1-4 ) . Our group also show disjoint pituitary TSH FT3 serum level operative condition levothyroxine monotherapy ( 5 ) . The present prospective observational study aim confirm finding explore additional factor TSH may important shape interrelation thyroid parameter modulate thyroidal activity health disease . To purpose , unselected patient present thyroid test treatment specialise unit teach hospital prospectively study assess interplay FT3 , FT4 TSH various condition , evaluate various thyroidal non-thyroidal influence , disease entity , thyroid volume , deiodinase activity , thyroid medication , surgery , radioiodine treatment , age , BMI , smoke pituitary set-point homeostatic equilibrium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : Prospective observational cross-sectional monocentre study Eligible Patients : Adult subject present thyroid test treatment Department Nuclear Medicine , Klinikum Luedenscheid , Luedenscheid , Germany . Inclusion criterion : All consecutively see subject consent precipitate fill questionnaire , represent full functional spectrum , see praxis set . Exclusion criterion analysis : Missing consent , severe illness may associate euthyroid sick syndrome ( non-thyroidal illness syndrome ) , pregnancy , pituitary hypothalamic disorder well medication may impair pituitary thyroid hormone feedback Methods : Except detail questionnaire study include routine work-up , establish standard procedure diagnosis standard care treatment thyroid disease Patient history physical examination Detailed questionnaire disease history medication Measurement thyroid function parameter autoantibody Ultrasound thyroid gland scintigraphy require Statistical analysis include group comparison , correlation , generalise linear model multiple covariates advance model technique feedback control FT3- FT4-TSH interrelation , previously describe ( 4 , 5 , 6 ) . Outcome Measures : Group comparison among treated patient untreated subject various disease entity , model lnTSH interaction FT4 FT3 , influence clinically relevant covariates FT3-FT4-TSH interrelation equilibrium .
