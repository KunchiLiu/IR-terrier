	<brief_title>Induction Preoperative Chemotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared breast cancer subtypes , patient triple-negative breast cancer lower recurrence-free overall survival , regardless disease stage diagnosis . That 's new approach treatment aggressive breast cancer subtype extremely anticipate . One way improve result treatment locally advance triple-negative breast cancer intensification induction preoperative chemotherapy regimen . Elevation rate pathological complete response completion intensification induction preoperative chemotherapy enable decrease stage increase survival aggressive breast cancer subtype . We hope achieve clinical pathological treatment response standard chemotherapy regimens therefore improve treatment outcomes extremely adverse group patient .</detailed_description>
