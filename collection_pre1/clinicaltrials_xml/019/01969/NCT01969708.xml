	<brief_summary>SCORE2 multicenter , prospective , randomize , phase III clinical trial participant enrol follow 2.5 year . SCORE2 design non-inferiority trial , study eye randomize intravitreal bevacizumab ( 1.25 mg ) every 4 week vs. intravitreal aflibercept ( 2.0 mg ) every 4 week . SCORE2 aim determine bevacizumab non-inferior aflibercept treatment macular edema associate central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) , primary outcome visual acuity measure Month 6 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparative Treatments Retinal Vein Occlusion 2 ( SCORE2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective SCORE2 test non-inferiority base mean change baseline visual acuity letter score Month 6 eye randomize intravitreal bevacizumab every 4 week compare eye randomize intravitreal aflibercept every 4 week use non-inferiority margin 5 letter . Secondary objective SCORE2 : - compare bevacizumab aflibercept group regard central retinal thickness , measure spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) , Month 6 change baseline Month 6 ; - assess Month 12 visual acuity SD-OCT outcomes associate different dosing strategy Month 6 participant respond well treatment ; - assess Month 12 visual acuity SD-OCT outcomes associate alternative treatment strategy Month 6 participant respond poorly treatment ; - compare area retinal ischemia rate neovascular complication CRVO bevacizumab vs. aflibercept group ; - add knowledge safety profile anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) medication set eye macular edema secondary CRVO ; - conduct cost effectiveness analysis compare intravitreal bevacizumab intravitreal aflibercept assess economic implication payor perspective use decision analytic method . Other exploratory aim SCORE2 : - investigate correlation feature identify SD-OCT segmentation analysis , IS-OS ( inner segment-outer segment ) junction ( also know ellipsoid zone ) , characteristic visual acuity central retinal thickness ; - investigate correlation area peripheral retinal nonperfusion widefield fluorescein angiography visual acuity central retinal thickness , prognostic value baseline peripheral central retina perfusion status predict disease course treatment responsiveness ; - investigate correlation feature adaptive optic image characteristic visual acuity central retinal thickness .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must centerinvolved macular edema secondary CRVO . Eyes may enrol early time diagnosis macular edema . The definition CRVO use SCORE also use purpose SCORE2 : CRVO define eye retinal hemorrhage biomicroscopic evidence retinal vein occlusion ( e.g. , telangiectatic capillary bed ) dilate venous system ( previously dilate venous system ) 4 quadrant . Due similarity hemiretinal vein occlusion ( HRVO ) CRVO , HRVO classify CRVO purpose clinical trial . Eyes classify HRVO limit 25 % plan sample size . A HRVO define eye retinal hemorrhage biomicroscopic evidence retinal vein occlusion ( e.g . telangiectatic capillary bed ) dilate venous system ( previously dilate venous system ) 5 clock hour less 4 quadrant . Typically , HRVO retinal vein occlusion involve 2 altitudinal quadrant . EEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity score great equal 19 letter ( approximately 20/400 ) less equal 73 letter ( approximately 20/40 ) ETDRS visual acuity protocol . The investigator must believe study eye visual acuity 19 33 letter perfuse . Retinal thickness SDOCT measurement , defined central subfield thickness 300 µm great . If SDOCT measurement take Heidelberg Spectralis Machine , central subfield thickness 320 µm great . Media clarity , pupillary dilation participant cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , chronic alcoholism drug abuse , personality disorder use major tranquilizer indicate difficulty long term followup , likelihood survival le 12 month ) . Participation investigational trial within 30 day study entry involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . History allergy antiVEGF agent , corticosteroid , component delivery vehicle . The participant move area clinical site area cover another clinical site 12 month study . Positive urine pregnancy test : woman childbearing potential ( premenopausal surgically sterilize ) may participate negative urine pregnancy test , intend become pregnant timeframe study . Women sexually active male partner must agree use least one follow birth control method : hormonal therapy oral , implantable injectable chemical contraceptive ; mechanical therapy spermicide conjunction barrier condom diaphragm ; intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; surgical sterilization partner . Women breastfeed . Examination evidence vitreoretinal interface disease ( e.g. , vitreomacular traction , epiretinal membrane ) , either clinical examination OCT think contribute macular edema . An eye , investigator 's opinion , would benefit resolution macular edema eye foveal atrophy , dense pigmentary change dense subfoveal hard exudate . Presence ocular condition , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , agerelated macular degeneration , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , iris neovascularization , IrvineGass Syndrome , prior maculaoff rhegmatogenous retinal detachment ) . Presence substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity 3 line ( i.e. , 20/40 cataract ) . History laser photocoagulation macular edema within 3 month prior randomization . History intravitreal corticosteroid within 4 month randomization . Intravitreal antiVEGF injection within 2 month randomization . Note : Enrollment limit 25 % plan sample size history antiVEGF treatment . Once number eye enrol , history antiVEGF treatment exclusion criterion . For enrollment study eye prior intravitreal antiVEGF agent , opinion investigator , treatment response prior antiVEGF treatment must either incomplete study eye develop recurrent CRVOassociated macular edema , study eye would benefit additional antiVEGF treatment . History peribulbar retrobulbar corticosteroid use reason within 2 month prior randomization . History panretinal scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) sector laser photocoagulation within 3 month prior randomization anticipate within next 3 month follow randomization . History major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within 4 month prior randomization anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization . History yttrium aluminum garnet ( YAG ) capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization . Aphakia . Presence anterior chamber intraocular lens Examination evidence external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion significant blepharitis . History macular detachment . Examination evidence diabetic retinopathy .</criteria>
