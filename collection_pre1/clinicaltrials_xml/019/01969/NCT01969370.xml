	<detailed_description>This study part large consortium project investigate validity best use next-generation sequencing ( particular , whole exome sequencing , WES ) clinical care . Participants patient either see University North Carolina Cancer Adult Genetics Clinic refer study physician . They approach physician genetic counselor recruitment . Once enrol , clinical geneticist genetic counselor obtain consent collect blood sample analyze use WES . Results may include information related diagnosis incidental information . Medically actionable incidental finding CLIA ( Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ) -certified returned participant routine genetic counseling session , along diagnostic finding . Eligible adult participant randomize opportunity choose get certain type non-medically actionable incidental finding , well . Their decision investigate , psychosocial behavioral response sequence receive sequence information . This longitudinal , mixed method study ( i.e. , multiple assessment pre- post-return result , quantitative qualitative method use gather data ) . Because quantitative component study use randomization , measure procedure associate component described .</detailed_description>
