The study population consist YLH , age 16-24 , current patient 5 ATN site . Site staff recruit potential participant . Youth randomize receive Healthy Choices , either clinic-based home-based deliver CHW condition . Outcomes measured baseline , 4- , 7- , 13-months . Data collection biological measure medical record extraction , self-reported measure occur use brief Web-based CASI ( computer-administered self-interviewing ) survey iPad . All intervention session audio-recorded MITI fidelity coding , investigator support local supervisor active intervention phase . We conduct qualitative interview CHWs , supervisor organization leader end trial obtain information barrier facilitator implementation . Thus , propose trial allow u use Type 1 Effectiveness-implementation hybrid design pilot sustainable model MI implementation real-world youth care setting towards goal 1 ) examine effectiveness , cost-effectiveness , scalability efficacious behavioral intervention deliver CHWs real-world adolescent HIV care setting ; 2 ) gathering information respond context ; 3 ) increase understanding barrier facilitator future implementation .
