	<detailed_description>Corneal ulceration lead cause visual impairment globally , disproportionate burden develop country . Corneal opacity ulceration responsible significant proportion blind eye disease Africa Asia . While antimicrobial treatment generally effective eradicate infection , `` successful '' treatment often associate poor visual outcome . The scar accompanies resolution infection leave many eye blind . It difficult discern difference different antimicrobial randomize control trial ( RCT ) . In fact , single RCT 50 subject find significant difference ulcer treatment . Thus , prevention corneal ulceration may best opportunity reduce morbidity associate corneal ulceration . Several non-randomized prevention study Nepal , Myanmar , Bhutan suggest antibiotic ointment apply promptly corneal abrasion could dramatically lower incidence ulcer , relative neighbor historic control . In Madurai , South India , clinical trial demonstrate abrasion randomize topical antibacterial antifungal prophylaxis significantly less likely develop fungal ulcer randomize antibacterial ointment alone , even though region high incidence fungal infection . This trial also find incidence ulcer village outside prophylaxis program far high ; control villages neighbor randomize , possible way different village include program . VIEW design determine whether prevent corneal ulcer large scale . VIEW community-randomized trial comparing village randomize receive intervention consist train community health volunteer provide antimicrobial ointment corneal abrasion control villages receive additional intervention . The primary outcome corneal ulcer measure baseline annual population-based census perform intervention control villages mask examiner baseline 36 month . The examiner photograph corneas resident suspect corneal ulcer , photograph later read masked examiner . Each resident village examine evidence corneal opacity ask ocular history . In village randomize intervention , train community health volunteer actively promote service regular meeting local woman 's group encourage resident notify village eye health worker within 24 hour ocular trauma . In control village , abrasion ulcer treat present clinic find annual monitoring visit , active promotion corneal abrasion care offer .</detailed_description>
