	<brief_summary>Background : In recent year grow interest sedentary behaviour define activity perform sit lie position waking hour . Sedentary behaviour recognise independent risk factor cardiovascular disease mortality . A intervention study older sedentary people overweight obese adult demonstrate , daily sit time reduce behavioural intervention . Patients rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) increase risk cardiovascular disease , partly cause rheumatic disease also physical inactivity . Studies document positive effect increase physical activity pain physical functioning patient RA . However , study also show , patient find difficult maintain increase physical activity level time . Previous study suggest promote health among patient mobility disability solely focus increase moderate vigorous physical activity also target reduction sedentary behaviour increase light physical activity . In present study focus reduction daily sit time increase light physical activity approach may prove feasible patient RA . Objectives hypothesis : We hypothesise , sedentary behaviour reduce patient RA behavioural lifestyle change . In addition , hypothesize , reduction daily sit time positive effect symptom general health patient RA . The primary objective present intervention study investigate effect motivational counselling intervention daily sit time adult men woman RA . Furthermore want investigate whether reduction daily sit time relate reduction pain fatigue , reduce weight waist circumference improve quality life , physical function improve cardiovascular biomarker level ( cholesterol blood pressure ) . Study set allocation : In total , 150 participant recruit rheumatology outpatient clinic Glostrup University Hospital , Denmark . The participant allocate either intervention group ( 75 ) control group ( 75 ) . Intervention : The intervention aim support strengthen participant ' belief ability reduce daily sit time . The intervention include 1 ) three individual motivational counselling session ( 60-90 minute ) , conduct one four project nurse combination 2 ) Individual Short Text Messages ( SMS ) . The counselling session focus information positive health effect reduce daily sit time participant ' goal reduce sit time . Based goal participant receive weekly SMS reminder . Data collection : Measurements participant do four time 22 month ; 1 ) baseline , 2 ) 16 week start ( end intervention ) , 3 ) six month end intervention 4 ) 18 month end intervention . At four visit participant fill questionnaire regard demographic , lifestyle , daily sit time , physical activity , physical function , pain , fatigue quality life . Furthermore , two occupational therapist measure participant ' blood pressure , height , weight waist circumference . At time little monitor place participant ' thigh , carry seven day . The monitor measure participant ' physical activity level . The four measurement also include blood sample participant order measure cholesterol level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale : Physical inactivity establish risk factor chronic disease premature death . In addition physical inactivity sedentary behaviour recognise distinct independent risk factor cardio metabolic morbidity mortality increase number population-based observational study . Patients rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) increase risk cardio metabolic disease pre-mature death . The increase risk , partly cause chronic autoimmune rheumatic disease partly traditional risk factor e.g . hyperlipidemia hypertension , also attribute physical inactivity . In Denmark 67 % patient RA comply public health recommendation daily moderate vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) , equivalent proportion find Germany ( 68 % ) United Kingdom ( 67 % ) . Everyday life patient suffer RA periodically influence high disease activity ( flare ) symptoms swell stiffness joint accompany intense pain , lead severe limitation physical function potential progressive joint destruction . Intervention study patient RA document positive effect exercise pain physical functioning . However , study also demonstrate exercise increase activity level difficult maintain time . Pain identify main barrier adaptation maintenance physically activity lifestyle . Sedentary behaviour define low metabolic cost activity perform sit recline position wake hour . Sedentary behaviour become increasingly prevalent modern society , recent population study use self-reported questionnaire estimate daily sit time 8-9 hour per day , correspond 50-60 % waking hour adult general population sample . Likewise , American population-based study among 4.757 adult , find objectively measure daily sit time 8.44 hour . A study monitor objectively measure sitting time patient chronic disease mobility disability , study generally find high proportion day spend sit among people various type mobility disability , i.e . stroke ( 86-88 % waking hour ) , multiple sclerosis ( 75-85 % waking hour ) Parkinson 's disease ( 76 % waking hour ) . However , knowledge study report objectively measure sitting time patient RA . A review 2011 suggest aim increase PA level among patient mobility disability solely focus increase MVPA , also target reduction sedentary time increase light intensity activity , approach may prove feasible improve health well-being among sedentary patient chronic disease mobility limitation . A short term intervention study older people , overweight obese adult demonstrate sedentary behaviour reduce behavioural intervention physical activity energy expenditure may increase reduction TV-viewing time . All study apply objective measure sit time . Objectives : We hypothesize sedentary behaviour reduce patient RA behavioural lifestyle change . The primary objective present randomise trial investigate effect individually tailor , theory-based motivational counselling intervention daily sit time patient rheumatoid arthritis sit time 5 hour day . The secondary objective explore whether reduction daily sit time relate reduction pain fatigue , improve health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , self-reported physical function self-efficacy improve cardiovascular biomarker level , assess cost-effectiveness intervention . Design : The 'Joint Resources ' sedentary behaviour intervention study ( JR-Sedentary Behaviour ) randomise , control , observer-blinded trial two parallel group primary endpoint change objectively measure daily sit time . Study setting : Patients recruited list patient RA rheumatology outpatient clinic Copenhagen University Hospital , Glostrup , Capital Region Denmark ( approximately 2000 patient annually ) . Recruitment , screen participant : The patient ' medical record screen diagnosis code late HAQ-score . Potentially eligible patient receive letter invitation together write information study folder basic information trial personal right accordance guideline Danish Scientific Ethical Committees . A day later daily project leader call ask interest participate study . If interested must answer two `` screening question '' 1 ) self-reported daily sit time leisure work , 2 ) self-reported participation vigorous physical activity ( question The Physical Activity Scale ( PAS 2.1 ) ) . If eligible patient invite information session project leader . It possible patient sign consent form immediately follow session alternatively follow two day . Sample size : Calculation sample size base data complete feasibility study ( publication preparation ) total daily time patient RA objectively measure ActivePAL . The daily average sitting time 10.13±1.7 hour ( mean±SD ) . In present intervention study expect reduction average daily sit time 50 minute intervention group . This estimate base American pilot study 2012 obese office worker reduce daily sit time 48 minute result intervention . Based result study , significance level α = 5 % , power 80 % need include 62 patient group . To compensate attrition aim recruit 75 patient group . Randomization blinding : Immediately follow baseline measurement randomization either ( A ) intervention group ( N = 75 ) ( B ) control group ( N = 75 ) perform via computer-generated `` random number '' two group ( block 10 patient ) . Patients informed project leader group allocation one week baseline measurement . All measurement conduct two occupational therapist blind group allocation . Intervention : The intervention include 1 ) Individual motivational counselling include handout four key message regard reduction daily sit time combination 2 ) Individual Short Text Message ( SMS ) reminder . 1 . Individual motivational counsel The intervention consist three individual motivational counselling ( 60-90 minute ) session , conduct one four nurse occupational therapist , train conduct specific intervention . The first counsel take place immediately randomization allocation intervention group , second counsel two week , third counsel ten week first counsel . Contents motivational counsel The intervention focus individual goal set self-efficacy , participant describe everyday life term sit time decide reduce daily sit time , overcome barrier goal , term reduce sit time , aim . Motivational counselling technique use . First , project staff introduce patient possible benefit reduce daily sit time . Secondly , project staff ask patient describe typical day order identify resource barrier reduction daily sit time discus possible solution overcome barrier use resource . Thirdly , patient set goal reduction daily sit time use `` catalogue idea '' , contain proposal reduce create break sit time . Specific proposal reduce daily sit time example stand phone conversation TV-watching , get frequently go printer , get least every half hour walk around , get change TV channel , make one cup coffee time . During motivational counselling session number two three patient goal evaluate , new goal set possible solution strategy address . The patient ' motivation confidence ability change focus last two session . The intervention program focus 4 key message theme , include idea suggestion reduction sit time , write booklet hand patient session . The four key message : 1 ) Reduce daily TV-viewing , 2 ) Substitute sit stand possible - work and/or home , 3 ) Break prolong sit - stand frequently 4 ) Maximum 30 minute sit per episode . 2 . Individual SMS reminder Based patient ' individually goal patient decide many weekly SMS reminder want receive 16-week intervention period time day . Examples SMS text message show : - Hello X . Raise table stand-up allow gravity assist lunch digest . Bonus : You burn energy stand . - Hi X . Regard vacuum clean free fitness hour . Put music ear stop list clean do . - Hi X . You truly privilege colleague afternoon able see stand table . Show , might follow good example . - Hey X . Put remote control next TV turn television today . Every time change channel entire body get exercise . Control group : The control group encourage maintain usual lifestyle 16-week intervention period . Participant timeline : The trial last 22 month include 16-week intervention 18 month follow-up . Data collection : Measurements do four time 22 month 1 ) baseline ; 2 ) end intervention ( 16 week intervention start ) ; 3 ) six month intervention end finally ( 4 ) 18 month intervention end . At time patient fill self-complete questionnaire regard demographic , lifestyle , sit time work leisure time , physical activity , physical function , pain , fatigue , health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) self-efficacy . Subsequently , blood pressure , height , weight , waist circumference measure two occupational therapist . Blood sample test take Department Diagnostics , Division Clinical Biochemistry , Copenhagen University Hospital , Glostrup store test . Baseline demographic characteristic patient collect via self-reported questionnaire ( use iPad ) . The two occupational therapist also put ActivPAL monitor , objectively measure participant ' physical activity level period seven day . One week ( 7 day ) baseline measurement participant return hospital removal ActivPAL . At time informed TT group allocation . One week follow measurement patient return ActivPAL close envelope . During 7 day-period ActivPal patient fill diary non-wear-and sleep time order isolate sitting time non-wear sleeping . The patient recruit DANBIO database , nationwide registry include &gt; 25,000 patient inflammatory arthritis longitudinal observational cohort . At medical visit outpatient clinic , treat rheumatologist register information DANBIO include data regard disease characteristic ( e.g . patient-reported outcome , disease activity , functional status , disease course ) medical treatment . Data management : Since data supply directly patient assessor online interface via iPad , risk data loss data distortion along way . Data store encrypt unidentifiable form ( use participant-numbers ) server Glostrup Hospital . Standard miss data analysis determine unexpected miss data due participant drop-out random . Analysis : Descriptive statistic regression analyzes conduct . Data analysis base intention-to-treat principle . The score standardized questionnaire make accord guideline instrument developer . A cost analysis report resource use cost intervention . For intervention control group survey registry base data resource use include service provide health care sector ( primary secondary care ) pharmaceutical aggregate individual interval determine time data collection . Cost data interpolate total cost whole observation period ( 18 month ) . The aggregated cost data analyze cost attributable intervention ( i.e . difference difference ) report mean value 95 % ( bootstrap ) confidence interval . Due non-normal distribution cost data generalize linear model employ appropriate choice link function . The analysis cost-effectiveness compare observe gain QALY ( HRQOL 18 month ) observe incremental cost ( 18 month ) estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . To express statistical uncertainty ICER estimate acceptability curve develop express likelihood intervention cost-effective various QALY threshold value . The regression model allow control baseline value study endpoint confound variable may impact change sedentary behavior ( e.g . age , gender ) . In addition , drop-out analysis conduct . Treatment outcomes examine use mixed effect model , Bonferroni-correcting multiple comparison . All analysis carry SAS statistical software 9.3 . Ethics , confidentiality dissemination : The trial perform accordance Helsinki Declaration . The project review Regional Committee Biomedical Research Ethics September 2012 registry base research .
