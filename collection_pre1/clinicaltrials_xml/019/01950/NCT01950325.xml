	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A volunteer must meet following criterion : 1 . Able willing complete inform consent process . 2 . 1860 year old dose escalation ; 1870 year old subsequent enrollment viremic subject . 3 . HIV infect clinically stable , Volunteers dose escalation part study also must , without change ARV status ( whether take ARV regimen ) 24 week prior enrollment . 4 . Criteria volunteer enrol dose escalation part study : Plasma viral load ( VL ) CD4 count meet eligibility criterion least two measurement perform within 24 week prior enrollment . The two measurement use eligibility must least 3 day test least one set test must perform NIH Clinical Center within 84 day prior enrollment . If ARV treatment , criterion : VL le equal 50,000 copies/mL CD4 count great equal 400/mcL . If ARV treatment , criterion : VL le equal 50 copies/mL CD4 count great equal 350/mcL . Note : A viral blip &lt; 400 copies/mL 24 week prior enrollment permit preceded followed test result show VL le equal 50 copies/mL ARV regimen . ] Criteria viremic volunteer enrol dose escalation complete : At least one detectable plasma viral load great equal 50 copies/mL least one CD4 count great equal 200 cells/mcL within 84 day prior enrollment . Note : Up 10 viremic subject enrol 4 subject screen VL &gt; 100,000 copies/mL receive VRC01 . Other subject must screen VL le equal 100,000 copies/mL 5 . In general good health willing maintain establish relationship primary health care provider medical management HIV infection participate study . 6 . Willing blood sample collect , store indefinitely , use various research purpose . 7 . Able provide proof identity satisfaction study clinician complete enrollment process . 8 . Screening laboratory value within 84 day prior enrollment must meet following criterion : absolute neutrophil count great equal 800/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL hemoglobin great equal 10.0 gm/dL creatinine less equal 1.31 mg/dL alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 2.5 time ULN FemaleSpecific Criteria : 9 .
