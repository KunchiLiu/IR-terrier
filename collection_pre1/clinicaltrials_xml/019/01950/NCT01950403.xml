	<brief_title>Linaclotide Acetate Preventing Colorectal Cancer Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacodynamic effect ( PD ) linaclotide ( linaclotide acetate ) ( single daily dose x 7 day , stage I cohort dose= 0.870 mg/day ) cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) level , base biopsy sample obtain pre‐ post‐intervention rectum , effect document . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To confirm safety tolerability linaclotide . II . To assess pharmacodynamic effect linaclotide cGMP level , analyze sequentially transverse colon cecum , cGMP effect observe rectum primary endpoint . III . To compare change cGMP level baseline day 7 assign dos linaclotide ( include placebo ) , analyze sequentially rectum , transverse colon , cecum . IV . If study proceeds stage II , pharmacodynamic effect linaclotide cGMP level assess day 6 rectal biopsy ( un‐prepped ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacodynamic effect linaclotide additional pathway‐specific biomarkers relevant guanylate cyclase C ( GCC ) signal ( i.e. , vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein [ VASP ] phosphorylation ) marker general proliferation ( Ki67 expression ) , base intestinal mucosa biopsy sample obtain colonoscopy pre‐ post‐exposure anatomical location ( rectum , transverse colon , cecum ) cGMP elevate follow linaclotide exposure . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Participants receive linaclotide acetate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 . ARM II : Participants receive placebo PO QD day 1-7 . After completion treatment , participant follow 21-51 day .</detailed_description>
