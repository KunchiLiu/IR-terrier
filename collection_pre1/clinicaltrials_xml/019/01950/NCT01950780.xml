	<brief_summary>Alopecia areata ( AA ) common disease immune system , know `` autoimmune '' disease . In disease , immune system mistakenly destroy hair follicle , cause hair fall . Despite many people disease , research cause new , good way treat AA lag far behind similar disease immune system . Currently , Federal Drug Administration approve drug AA . Ruxolitinib ( make Incyte ) intervention know effectively treat disease bone marrow , know myelofibrosis . It also study treatment rheumatoid arthritis , another `` autoimmune '' disease , fight inflammation . There genetic chemical similarity myelofibrosis , active rheumatoid arthritis AA , suggest treatment ruxolitinib may effective AA . In mouse specially design test drug treatment human alopecia areata , medication work prevent disease AA start mouse would otherwise developed disease . To test Ruxolitinib , go treat 12 patient moderate severe AA minimum 3 month 6 month . This `` open-label '' study , mean placebo group ; patient enrol study receive active medication . The effectiveness medication measure change hair re-growth determined physical exam photography , well patient physician scoring . Patients follow another 3 month drug see effect treatment last delayed response . The safety medication , ruxolitinib , patient alopecia areata also evaluate . Blood work collect medication start , treatment period , ruxolitinib stop , order monitor adverse effect medication . Small scalp biopsy peripheral blood take begin study treatment also 12 possibly 24 week . Optional biopsy may also take additional time point base clinical consideration . The chemical analysis skin sample blood help u understand disease happen , treatment work , may even guide u good treatment future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Efficacy Ruxolitinib Alopecia Areata</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata ( AA ) common autoimmune disease result immune destruction hair follicle subsequent hair loss . Despite high prevalence , research pathogenesis development innovative therapy AA lag far behind autoimmune disease . Currently , FDA approve drug AA . Ruxolitinib ( Incyte ) intervention know effectively treat myelofibrosis also rheumatoid arthritis modulate inflammatory response interferon response pathway inhibition Jak1/Jak2 . Rheumatoid arthritis share several susceptibility gene common AA . All three disease share central role interferon-gamma response pathway , rationale select Ruxolitinib evaluation clinical trial . Both systemic topical Ruxolitinib show prevent onset AA C3H-HeJ animal model AA , demonstrate preclinical proof-of-concept data AA . To test safety efficacy Ruxolitinib patient moderate severe AA , propose open-label , single arm pilot study total 12 patient , treat minimum 3 month 6 month . Efficacy measure change hair re-growth determined physical exam photography , well patient physician global evaluation score . Patients follow another 3 month evaluate durability response follow treatment phase . Punch biopsy peripheral blood obtain baseline prior treatment 12 possibly 24 week immune monitor molecular study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 75 year age . Patients diagnosis patch type alopecia areata . Patients &gt; 30 % &lt; 95 % total scalp hair loss baseline measure use SALT score . Two patient current episode alopecia totalis/universalis may include study . Duration hair loss great 3 month . No evidence regrowth present baseline . Patients may na√Øve treatment unresponsive intralesional ( IL ) steroids treatment alopecia areata . Patients history active skin disease scalp psoriasis seborrheic dermatitis . Patients diagnosis alopecia areata question . Patients active medical condition malignancy ( except adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma ) opinion investigator would increase risk associate study participation , include patient history recurrent infection . Women childbearing potential unable unwilling use two form birth control study duration . Women pregnant nursing . Patients know HIV hepatitis B C positive . Patients history evidence hematopoietic abnormality . Patients &lt; 200K platelet count baseline . Patients history evidence renal hepatic impairment . Patients history immunosuppression history recurrent serious infection . Patients unwilling unable discontinue treatment know affect hair regrowth AA . Patients take medication consider strong CYP3A4 inhibitor unable unwilling stop medication duration study . Patients receive treatment deem affect alopecia areata within 2 week one month baseline visit depend specific treatment .</criteria>
