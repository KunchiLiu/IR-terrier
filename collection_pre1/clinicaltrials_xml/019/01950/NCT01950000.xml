	<brief_summary>Background : Few study address situation procedural pain use preemptive analgesia turn patient mechanical ventilation . Aim : Evaluation effect preemptive fentanyl incidence pain turn maneuver critically ill patient mechanical ventilation . Design : Single-center clinical trial , national , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , two arm treatment : saline placebo fentanyl . Primary Endpoint : Incidence pain turn procedure carry nurse measure mean Behavioral Pain Scale ( BPS ) . Study Population : Critically ill patient , age &gt; 18 year , admit ICU expect require mechanical ventilation least 24 h. Sample Size : 80 patient divide two group ( 40 patient ) . Statistical Analysis : A preliminary descriptive analysis carry . Later , result primary end point compare eventual correction correspond variable use multivariable approach . The AUC variable analyze t-test unpaired data . A second analysis use multivariate approach carry factor consider clinically relevant relation pain therefore logistic regression use . Ethical Considerations : The study strictly conduct follow Declaration Helsinki protocol Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) ensure compliance Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) standard . It responsibility researcher obtain valid informed consent guardian / legal representative , patient 's condition allow consent . Before obtain consent investigator explain guardian / legal representative nature study , purpose , procedure , estimate duration , potential risk benefit associate participation , well inconvenience may involve . Duration Treatment : The treatment maximum duration 60 min patient . The follow-up include visit duration 6 consecutive day . Safety Assessment : Potential side effect treatment record . Frequent adverse effect fentanyl administration include respiratory depression , apnea , muscle rigidity , bradycardia transient hypotension .</brief_summary>
