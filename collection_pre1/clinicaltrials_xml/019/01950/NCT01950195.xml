	<brief_summary>This research do look safety use stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) Ipilimumab together treat melanoma spread brain spine . Both Ipilimumab SRS use alone treatment melanoma spread . Standard care use treatment together . By use together , expect well treatment melanoma , might increase side effect . `` Ipilimumab '' approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment melanoma spread throughout body . It work activate immune system fight cancer . `` Stereotactic radiosurgery '' ( SRS ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment melanoma brain spine . It use radiation treat tumor without need cut use stitch . The use combine SRS Ipilimumab research study investigational . The word `` investigational '' mean combination approve marketing Food Drug Administration allow use research study .</brief_summary>
