	<brief_summary>Sacral nerve stimulation ( SNS ) become well-established treatment patient fecal incontinence since 1995 . The mechanism action SNS still fully understood recent study show change colonic motility rectal sensibility . The investigator previously show IBS patient benefit sacral nerve stimulation . With present study , investigator aim evaluate sacral nerve stimulation alters gastro-colic response IBS patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodal Stimulation Before After Sacral Nerve Stimulation Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty four patient IBS-D IBS-M accord ROME III criterion , enrol study . Having meet inclusion criterion , patient examine Multimodal Stimulation baseline six week sacral nerve stimulation test period . During Multimodal Stimulation patient impedance planimetry conduct standardised meal evaluate gastro-colic response without sacral nerve stimulation . The patient enrol study time period participate another study evaluate subsensory sacral nerve stimulation . A study register clinical trial . Here patient randomise receive either OFF-subsensory subsensory-OFF stimulation 2+2-week period follow 2 week suprasensory stimulation . Hereby render stimulation test period total 6 week ( permanent electrode use ) .</detailed_description>
