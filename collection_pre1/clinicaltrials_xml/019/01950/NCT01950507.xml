In Cohorts 2 3 , fluconazole voriconazole discontinue day 7 , micafungin add period azole prophylaxis subject systemic corticosteroid ( antifungal prophylaxis deem necessary ) . In three cohort , budesonide Cmin Cmax measure presence absence concurrent fluconazole voriconazole therapy . At least seven day interval use intervention allow steady state occur prior measurement budesonide serum concentration . There literature interaction oral budesonide micafungin , pharmacokinetic data suggest micafungin low potential cause drug-drug interaction inhibition CYP3A4 , thus assume micafungin significantly affect Cmin Cmax budesonide study .</detailed_description>
