	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause physical disability , particularly due presence spasticity . Different needle technique , include use Botulinum Toxin A propose management spasticity . The presence spasticity low extremity implies several impairment stand walk induce high disability . No study investigate effect deep dry needling insert targeted spastic musculature patient stroke . The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial investigating effect single session deep dry needling musculature leg spasticity , widespread pressure pain sensitivity plantar pressure ( baropodometry ) individual chronic stroke . The investigator hypothesize patient receive single session dry needling would exhibit great reduction spasticity pressure sensitivity receive intervention .</brief_summary>
