	<brief_summary>Background : - Sickle cell disease change shape red cell . This make likely break get stuck small blood vessel . This lead low red cell count also damage small blood vessel supply many organ . One affected organ liver . Sickle cell disease treatment blood transfusion lead significant liver damage . This disease also cause liver regrow abnormally damage . This cause high blood pressure liver . Researchers want know cure sickle cell disease stem cell transplant improve liver damage . Objectives : - To explore specific factor improve worsen sickle cell liver disease stem cell transplant . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 old sickle cell liver disease . Design : - Participation take approximately 7 day 2 year . - Visit 1 : participant screen medical history review current treatment regimen . - Visit 2 : participant return clinic explanation study physical exam . They also blood urine test , scan liver . - All participant 2-night stay clinic . They liver biopsy test liver pressure . They sedate tube insert vein neck . - Participants stem cell transplant second biopsy 24 month later . - Over 2-year study period , participant blood draw 2-4 time stool sample collect 2 time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Sickle Cell Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) cause multi-organ dysfunction early death affected individual . Many succumb complication chronic organ dysfunction eventual organ failure one liver . Spectrum sickle cell liver disease range hepatic sequestration crisis , intrahepatic cholestasis , gallstone , non-cirrhotic portal hypertension , chronic sickle hepatopathy cirrhosis complication treatment disease include secondary iron overload viral hepatitis . Though liver transplantation perform SC-induced liver failure , crude mortality rate 60 % make poor choice . It therefore imperative identify patient liver dysfunction damage possible early intervention . Stem cell transplant currently cure SCD NIH SCD hepatopathy one indication transplant . It currently know stem cell transplant reverse SCD liver disease hence intend study compare nature SCD liver disease pre post stem cell transplant transplant ineligible patient . All SCD patient screen liver disease prior enrollment include fibroscan evaluation . Primary end point histological evidence regression liver disease . Hence patient transplant eligible arm undergo liver biopsy pre 12-24 month post transplant . Transplant ineligible patient offer liver biopsy clinically indicate . Patients already undergone transplant include data evaluate retrospectively . Serum plasma , liver tissue stool sample evaluate extensively parameter liver function test , iron metabolism , clot factor , inflammatory marker include microbial product . The intention study use sickle cell disease model predict marker progression regression liver disease .</detailed_description>
