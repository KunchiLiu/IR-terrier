	<brief_summary>The biology prostate cancer associate change gene metabolite within prostate tissue . There robust evidence suggest diet rich broccoli prevent retard development prostate cancer influencing change . This likely due natural chemical obtain vegetable know sulforaphane . In study , seek provide evidence diet rich broccoli may prevent prostate cancer develop , understand may happen . We propose undertake human intervention study test hypothesis broccoli-rich diet alter metabolism gene expression within prostate tissue men active surveillance manner would reduce probability emergence progression aggressive cancerous clone . Participants recruit onto study randomly allocate one three dietary group require consume one portion per week broccoli soup deliver different concentration sulforaphane . This part normal diet one year . Blood , urine prostate biopsy tissue obtain 12 month intervention period . Prostate biopsy obtain either though transperineal template biopsy , technique accept best clinical practice provide well sample prostate , transrectal ultrasound guide biopsy currently standard care obtain biopsy . This study fund Biotechnology Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) Prostate Cancer foundation ( PCF ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Sulforaphane Prostate CAncer PrEvention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomise double-blinded dietary intervention study . The study population consist smoke non-smoking men age 18 80 year old . Participants recruit study randomly place one three dietary group require consume one portion broccoli soup per week , deliver different level glucoraphanin ( sulforaphane precursor ) , part normal diet one year . The three type soup contain ( ) standard broccoli , ( ii ) glucoraphanin-enriched broccoli ( Beneforte® ) , ( iii ) Beneforte extra . Beneforte Beneforte extra broccoli especially cultivate deliver high sulforaphane level consumption . All three broccoli variety appearance flavour thus enable blind human intervention study undertaken . Broccoli soup manufacture food company supply soup lead supermarket retailer United Kingdom . In order ass habitual diet participant , ask keep three 7-day diet diary , one pre-intervention , 6-months another one week end intervention . Considering effect exercise whole body metabolism also obtain information physical activity study participant . They ask complete validated physical activity questionnaire together diet diary ( i.e start study diet 6 12 month ) . Twenty six participant recruit broccoli group . The participant characterise low intermediate risk develop prostate cancer undergo active surveillance . A number physiological test perform participant start dietary intervention ( baseline ) 12 month intervention . The study involve collection prostate biopsy , blood urine sample baseline 12 month dietary intervention . Prostate biopsy obtain transperineal template biopsy ( TPB ) possible standard transrectal ultrasound scan guide biopsy ( TRUS biopsy ) . TPB clinical procedure carry general regional anaesthetic give detailed information position , amount aggressiveness cancer within prostate standard technique . However , patient wish undergo TPB alternatively choose standard TRUS biopsy . At end trial participant ask give write consent wish continue diet 12 month . Consenting patient thereafter require eat one portion broccoli soup per week 12-months . We ask participant attend extra hospital visit purpose study give additional biological sample ; instead capture clinical data relate follow prostate cancer . It anticipate dropout rate study approximately 25 % due clinical progression prostate cancer within 12-month study period . In event clinical progression volunteer discontinue intervention , receive advice urologist charge case prostatectomy ask donate part prostate gland research purpose .</detailed_description>
