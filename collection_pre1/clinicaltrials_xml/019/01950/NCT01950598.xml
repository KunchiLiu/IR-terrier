	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether frozen cornea safe effective fresh cornea use carrier Boston Keratoprosthesis type I ( KPro ) long term follow-up . Corneal transplantation typically perform use fresh , transparent cornea . With KPro surgery , corneal transplant serf carrier suture KPro place . The cornea use KPro surgery need clear like normal transplant . Frozen corneal tissue use repair cornea case emergency tissue transparent allow good vision . We hypothesize frozen graft equivalent fresh graft use carrier KPro .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frozen Versus Fresh Corneal Carriers Boston KPro Type I Donor Carriers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Boston Keratoprosthesis ( KPro ) collar-button shaped device make specialized clear plastic material . This device use replace diseased opaque cornea clear window vision improve . KPro surgery alternative traditional corneal graft use traditional corneal graft fail poor probability success . During KPro surgery , KPro need incorporated corneal graft suture patient 's cornea . The corneal graft serve support KPro help re-establish vision . The cornea typically use carrier KPro fresh cornea provide donor . These fresh cornea also use traditional corneal transplantation , without KPro implantation . Due shortage fresh cornea province Quebec , project interested evaluate cornea previously freeze act carrier KPro . The frozen cornea use traditional corneal transplantation surgery transparent . However , act support KPro , case , KPro corneal graft re-establishes vision . The use frozen cornea KPro surgery potential improve access corneal donor tissue improve wait-times KPro surgery . 37 patient recruit Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal ( CHUM ) , Notre-Dame Hospital October 2008 November 2009 . Participants divide 2 group : first group receive KPro fresh corneal carrier graft second group receive KPro frozen carrier graft . The use fresh frozen corneal graft depend availability fresh tissue morning surgery . 19 patient receive fresh carrier graft 18 receive frozen carrier graft . Patients follow postoperative day 1 , week 1 2 , month 1 , 3 6 every 1 3 month thereafter 2 year . At follow-up visit , complete ophthalmological examination perform , include best-corrected Snellen visual acuity slit lamp assessment leak , tissue necrosis , melt , extrusion , inflammation , retroprosthetic membrane formation infectious endophthalmitis . The current study aim re-consent patient previously enrol study prospectively evaluate long-term outcome KPro surgery use either fresh frozen carrier graft . IRB approval obtain CHUM . Written informed consent concern patient obtain extension study routine visit CHUM Ophthalmology department . Patients study continue routine follow-up frequency determine surgeon , may vary every 3 6 month . Outcome measure include surgical feasibility , level preoperative postoperative visual acuity ( VA ) , retention device complication state . Outcomes compare 5 10 year .</detailed_description>
