	<brief_summary>Objective : This study conduct explore possible correlation gene related pain sensation individual basal pain perception postoperative pain intensity general population . Methods : Patients receive elective surgery general anesthesia recruit study . The investigator measure preoperative pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) pressure pain tolerance ( PTO ) . Pain intensity rest movement operation evaluate . And PCA drug consumption record . Also healthy college student volunteer recruit study . The investigator measure experimental pain sensitivity include pressure pain threshold ( PPT ) pressure pain tolerance ( PTO ) , etc . Then genotyping carry .</brief_summary>
