	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous research show dopamine , brain chemical , involve decision make . Different gene influence much dopamine people brain affect behavior . Researchers study gene associate dopamine affect decision make impulsiveness . All participant take test ; brain image take . Researchers study test response image ; look difference gene affect different type decision making . Objectives : - To see gene involve brain chemical , dopamine , related impulsiveness behavioral test . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18 55 . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - All participant study least 1 outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . Each visit last 2 4 hour . At first visit : - A blood sample take participant previously enrol 95-M-0150 - Participants give test memory , attention , concentration , think . - Some participant second visit . It schedule soon possible first . At second visit : - Participants MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) . They lie scanner 2 hour . The MRI use magnet , radio wave , computer produce detailed picture brain . - Participants repeat test first visit . Some do MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study examine effect genetic variability dopamine signal pathway metric measure impulsivity . Our hypothesis increase dopamine level conversion dopamine intracellular signal , bring specific variant gene pathway , increase impulsivity behavioral task . We examine variability recruit 400 ethnically racially diverse healthy adult male female volunteer age 18 55 . We carry genotyping , behavioral test functional magnetic resonance image group . We initially recruit large pool subject behavioral test genotyping . Behavioral test include various laboratory task relate impulsivity . We recently develop series task use group Parkinson patient impulsive/compulsive behavior ( PD+ICBs ) . Several task show large group effect Parkinson patient without ICBs ( PD +/- ICBs ) . We focus task present study . Specific examples include information sample task measure novelty preference . If genetic effect behavior large sample find , ask subset original sample return fMRI testing . The subset select allow u examine neural circuit operate differently function genotype . In word , select basis genotype . The outcome measure case difference brain activity function genotype , performance behavioral task .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects eligible study : 18 55 year age good physical health speak English well enough understand task instruction clearly EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects eligible study : major medical ( e.g . heart disease ) , neurological ( e.g . stroke ) psychiatric ( e.g . bipolar disorder ) illness vision and/or hear problem interferes test currently use psychotropic medication , antidepressant , steroid opiate currently use alcohol excess 14 drinks/week male 7 drinks/week female . lifetime history currently alcohol substance use dependence ( exclude nicotine ) require independent , concurrent treatment intervention ( , antabuse opiate treatment ) . This include selfhelp group treatment/intervention . understand consent procedure consent study Smoke half pack cigarette day In addition , additional exclusion criterion apply MRI study : Female subject pregnant positive pregnancy test 24 hour prior experiment exclude neuroimaging study . All subject question prior MRI scan possible occupational exposure metal sliver shaving , may become accidentally lodged tissue head neck . Subjects surgical clip shrapnel near brain blood vessel , subject cochlear implant , subject metallic body eye CNS , subject form implant wire metal device may concentrate radiofrequency field exclude MRI scan experiment possible risk MRI scanning . Those whose history suggestive problem also exclude MRI portion experiment . They may still participate behavioral experiment . Subjects unable lie flat back 2 hour uncomfortable small close space ( claustrophobia ) eligible participate MRI scan .</criteria>
