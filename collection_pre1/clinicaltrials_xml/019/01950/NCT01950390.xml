	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival patient receive ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival , response rate safety patient receive ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone . II . To evaluate utility immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) patient receive ipilimumab plus bevacizumab versus ipilimumab alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning course 8 , patient receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive bevacizumab Induction Therapy . Beginning course 8 , patient also receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
