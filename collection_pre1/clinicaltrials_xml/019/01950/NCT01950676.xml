	<brief_title>Feasibility Using Smart Phone Application Self-titration Insulin Glycemic Control Patients With T2DM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Many patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) require insulin therapy suboptimal glycemic control oral antidiabetic agent . Initiating insulin therapy adjust dosage vital improve clinical outcome among patient diabetes . However , timely appropriate dosage titration challenge many patient . Doctors also contend many patient lack confidence self-titrate insulin . Hence , reinforce patient ' self-empowerment important diabetes management . Developing tools facilitate dosage adjustment insulin may substantial benefit glycemic control . Objectives : The overall aim study investigate feasibility use patient-centered smart phone application insulin self-titration improve glycemic control relative usual care patient T2DM . The specific aim study determine technical clinical feasibility patient-centered smart phone application insulin self-titration glycemic control ( HbA1c ) suboptimally control patient T2DM start insulin treatment . Study Design : This 24-week study randomize control trial involve participant recruit Singapore General Hospital , 1500-bed tertiary care hospital . The target population consist insulin naive patient T2DM ( 30-70 year old ) suboptimal glycemic control ( HbA1c ≥ 7.5 % ) oral antidiabetic agent . Sample Size : Eighty patient recruit study randomize either intervention control group equal number ( n=40 ) within stratum define provider ( i.e. , within five doctor ) . Patients nest within provider , randomization within provider perform block 4 subject : 2 intervention 2 control . Subject Selection : Eligible patient recruit 18-month period Singapore General Hospital . All patient newly initiate insulin therapy receive standard diabetes education Diabetes Nurse Educators ( DNEs ) . The research coordinator doctor work closely DNEs identify eligible patient study . When patient eligible participate study , research coordinator provide study information brochure explain study design patient . Investigators obtain informed consent patient prior randomization . Intervention : Use smart phone application self-titration insulin Primary Outcome Variable : Difference change glycemic control ( HbA1c ) intervention control group Procedures : Recruited patient receive once-daily injection insulin detemir , long-acting insulin , give bedtime . The physician free keep patient oral antidiabetic agent , except thiazolidinediones . All recruit patient receive free glucometers test strip . Statistical Analysis : The primary analysis comparison mean reduction HbA1c 24 week post-randomization treatment control group context linear mixed-effects model random effect patient doctor . The study randomize , baseline feature potential confounders approximately balance treatment control group . However , sample size small ( 80 patient total ) mixed-effects model adjust covariates select use forward stepwise variable selection AIC criterion . Potential covariates include age , gender , whether patient smart-phone , treatment satisfaction . The mixed-effects model allow non-missing data use analysis without imputation . However , estimate difference reduction HbA1c unbiased , require distribution data missingness conditional variable model observe data depend value miss data , data missing-at-random.This common reasonable assumption . However , possible analysis attrition indicate additional covariates need include mixed-effects model . With aim develop tailor analysis plan definitive study , additional model comparison mean reduction HbA1c also consider . For example , linear mixed-effects model random slope intercept patient doctor incorporates intermediate HbA1c measurement patient also fit . It unknown priori whether model reduced power patient attain equilibrium titration different time model increase power us observation albeit group patient . Depending rate attrition whether attrition relate covariates , propensity score missingness may develop model fit adjust stratified score . The primary examination efficacy linear mixed-effects model random effect doctor patient , assumption distribution missingness conditional covariates observe data depend miss data value . However , investigator examine several analysis appropriateness include simple comparison reduction HbA1c treatment control group last-observation-carried-forward , expect fairly conservative , worst-observation-carried-forward , expect extremely conservative . What methods lack rigor may offset simplicity .</detailed_description>
