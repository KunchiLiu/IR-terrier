	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Proton Beam Therapy Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton Therapy : If eligible agree take part study , proton beam treatment deliver 2-3 day per week receive total 15 treatment . You receive proton beam therapy prostate . Your doctor place 2-3 small tissue marker ( size grain rice ) prostate help guide proton therapy . Anesthesia need procedure . For treatment , lie treatment table 20-30 minute . Study Visits : During proton therapy talk doctor feel 1 time every week . During last week proton therapy complete questionnaire . For first 24 month proton therapy every 6-12 month , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check PSA level complete questionnaire . How often visit occur study doctor . At 36 , 48 , 60 month proton therapy , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check PSA level ask complete questionnaire . After proton beam therapy end , study doctor think need , digital rectal exam , MRI , bone scan , and/or standard prostate biopsy check status disease . Length Study : You longer able take part study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end 60 month complete proton therapy . Your doctor continue provide necessary medical care participation end . This investigational study . Proton beam therapy deliver use FDA approve commercially available method . The alternative schedule proton beam therapy investigational . Up 150 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
