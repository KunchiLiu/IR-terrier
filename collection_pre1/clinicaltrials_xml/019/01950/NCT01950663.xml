	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy lead cause preventable blindness work age Americans . The associated loss quality life , economic loss health care cost lose productivity , stagger . This burden increase rapidly epidemic diabetes continue . In develop world , diabetic retinopathy expect become leading cause preventable blindness since prevalence diabetes correlate closely dietary change , obesity , sedentary lifestyle accompany economic development . Half people proliferative diabetic retinopathy blind within five year . With proven laser intravitreal drug therapy risk reduce less 5 % , ten-fold decrease risk . One third people diabetic macular edema suffer moderate visual loss three year . With proven therapy risk reduce less 10 % , three-fold decrease risk . Nonetheless , diabetic retinopathy remain leading cause preventable blindness work age Americans . Excellent diabetes control prevent significantly reduces development progression diabetic retinopathy approach require difficult lifestyle change . Therefore , timely identification patient risk blindness , assure receive proven care , essential eliminate blindness diabetic retinopathy . Unfortunately , despite decade public health awareness campaign program , 56.9 % US patient diabetes receive universally recommend eye evaluation 2011 . One reason failure complexity exist method diabetic retinopathy test . To effective , accurate test available primary care physician 's office since need additional visit ophthalmologist another reason universal test fail . To succeed primary care physician 's office , exist personnel , minimal training , must able accurately easily test patient . The test method must take little time require additional space since efficient time space utilization critical primary care setting . It must meet quality measure use Medicare payors award financial incentive . Finally , must reimburse favorable level . RETeval LKC Technologies ' new , handheld , non-invasive , device measure full-field ERG cone b-wave photopic flicker implicit time quickly easily primary care set . RETeval simple use take less five minute patient . It handheld device require additional space . Based published literature , implicit time significantly delay eye severe non proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) relative eye milder form DR . These finding suggest photopic ERG implicit time good indicator objective evaluation severity DR range mild NPDR PDR . This study measure accuracy RETeval device . ETDRS 7-field , dilate , stereo , color fundus photography , read accord ETDRS protocol , use gold standard . Cone b-wave photopic flicker implicit time , measure RETeval device , ETDRS photography , perform single visit . A random sample result , calibration set , use calibrate referral threshold RETeval device . The remain result , validation set , use independent validation ass accuracy . If RETeval accurate , accept quality measure meeting performance standard , ideal method test retinopathy patient diabetes .</detailed_description>
