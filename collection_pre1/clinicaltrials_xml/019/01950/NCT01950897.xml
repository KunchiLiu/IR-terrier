	<brief_summary>Muscular dystrophy cause mutation 30 gene , remain identify . Phenotypically , know one specific mutation affect expression several protein , cause difficulty diagnosis . Correct genotyping essential diagnosis , prognosis treatment , rely complexed analysis muscle tissue phenotype profile . Our research aim understand different gene mutation affect expression gene via muscle biopsy sample establishment phenotypic profile correct diagnosis individual patient . Establishment information critical understanding progression different muscular dystrophy devise new experimental therapy . The research also provide vital clue find new gene involve disease process . Muscle sample may also use establish cell culture test drug new therapy relevant treatment muscular dystrophy .</brief_summary>
