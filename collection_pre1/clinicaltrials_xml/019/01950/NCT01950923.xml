	<brief_title>Sildenafil Citrate Before Surgery Improving Kidney Function Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess accrual , retention , participation rate patient receive sildenafil ( sildenafil citrate ) compare placebo patient undergoing robotic partial nephrectomy ( RPN ) suspect renal malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate individual alteration glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 24 hour , 48 hour one month follow RPN compare placebo group . II . To evaluate individual alteration proteinuria 24 hour , 48 hour , one month three month follow RPN compare placebo group . III . To measure between-group difference estimate blood loss hemoglobin concentration 24 hour follow RPN . IV . To describe individual change blood pressure measurement note preoperative hold area , throughout procedure post-anesthesia care unit . V. To describe between-group variation vasopressor support intravenous fluid requirement operative procedure . VI . To compare overall complication rate ( within 90 day postoperatively ) group . VII . To obtain preliminary effect size sildenafil change GFR three month follow RPN . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive sildenafil citrate orally ( PO ) initiation standard robotic partial nephrectomy . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO initiation standard robotic partial nephrectomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month .</detailed_description>
