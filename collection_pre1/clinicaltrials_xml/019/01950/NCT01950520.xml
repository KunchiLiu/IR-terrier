	<brief_summary>Background : - Changes person body burn energy calorie affect weight time . The low level energy body need function call basal metabolic rate . In cold , burn extra energy , even start shiver . This call non-shivering thermogenesis occur different type tissue muscle fat . Researchers want learn type energy burning regulate . They hope help treat obesity future . Objectives : - Sub-study 1 : good understand non-shivering thermogenesis work . - Sub-study 2 : measure effect anti-obesity drug basal metabolic rate . - Sub-study 3 : good understand effect mirabegron , beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist , brown fat activity . Eligibility : - Healthy , lean adult male age 18 35 . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test , EKG . - For sub-studies 1 2 : - Participants receive one X-ray scan . - Each day , participant : &lt; TAB &gt; - Have height weight measure , urine collect . - Spend 4 hour temperature-controlled room furniture , toilet area , phone , computer . They wear small non-invasive device monitor activity , heart rate , temperature , shiver . &lt; TAB &gt; - Walk 30 minute . -For sub-study 3 : - Participants receive one DXA scan 4 PET/CT scan 4 MRIs - Each stay , participant : &lt; TAB &gt; - Have height weight measure , urine collect . - Spend 6 hour temperature-controlled room furniture , toilet area , phone , computer . They wear small non-invasive device monitor activity , heart rate , temperature , shiver . - Participants compensate time participation end study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The balance energy expenditure ( EE ) energy intake ultimately determines body weight . Resting EE major component ( 60-75 % ) total EE adult human . Resting EE dynamically adapt environmental change ambient temperature . In on-going study environmental temperature change within around thermoneutral zone , observe healthy young men increase EE 17 % basal metabolic rate process non-shivering thermogenesis ( NST ) . This capacity NST unexpectedly large compare prior report mild cold-induced thermogenesis ( 3 11 % ) suggest increase NST could explore intervention combat obesity . The aim study well understand physiology NST develop improved assay evaluate effect drug alter EE . For example , recently realize brown adipose tissue functional adult human white adipose tissue convert brown-adipose-like tissue increase heat production cold exposure . Moreover , skeletal muscle likely also play role cold-induced thermogenesis even overt shivering occur . It plausible mechanism govern heat production NST contribute regulation body weight thus may contribute current obesity epidemic : even small change EE , compensate change food intake , long-term effect body weight . This protocol two phase . The first use pharmacologic approach investigate mechanism NST young healthy lean male . Since principal physiologic stimulus BAT ( possibly muscle NST ) via sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) , b-adrenergic receptor may hold key role regulate human EE . We hypothesize , careful measurement NST ( individually-titrated cool environmental temperature , 18-21 C vs. thermoneutrality 27 C ) use b-adrenergic drug differ receptor specificity agonist/antagonist property , gain good understand regulation human NST . The second phase study focus measure FDA-approved drug ( aitu-obesity drug ) potential effect basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) thermoneutral condition . The rationale previous study drug effect EE human always rigorously enforce use thermoneutral condition , thus may increase variability underestimated effect , contribute inconclusive finding . It envision study knowledge mechanism regulate acute adaptive change rest energy expenditure effect drug therapy target obesity human .</detailed_description>
