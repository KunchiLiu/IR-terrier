	<brief_summary>Title : Pro-to-COLD , Procalcitonin Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease , COLD : Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease , Regarding : Patients hospitalize suspected acute exacerbation COPD + / - pneumonia . Background : Patients COPD exacerbation often get antibiotic . There considerable criticism , many patient bacterially infected antibiotic overconsumption lead resistance development side effect . The purpose : To show one reduce consumption antibiotic among patient hospitalize worsen COPD disease population Danish COPD patient give antibiotic depend value biomarker procalcitonin measure blood . A sub-objective validation study mini VIDAS ® / Biomérieux equipment current gold standard measure procalcitonin , Kryptor/ BRAHMS . Subjects : All patient confirmed/suspected COPD admit COPD exacerbation Acute Admissions Unit/ Pulmonary dept . weekday . Participants must adults age must sign informed consent . Method : 1 ) Controlled ( Quasi-randomized ) : Even uneven ( conceal ) digit patient´s danish personal identification number , last digit ( gender-fixed ) ( CPR-number ) . Even = procalcitonin-guided , Uneven = Control . 2 ) Collect analyze procalcitonin ( PCT ) -samples patient PCT group admission every 2 day . Samples analyze throughout week : Vital Status look 28 day inclusion . Create biobank study consist blood à 8 ml maximum 4 time take PCT measurement , subsequent validation study MiniVIDAS ® . Biobank destroy 15 year complete project . Statistical consideration : 1 . Sample size / Sample Size : A total 120 patient ( please see basis estimate Protocol ) . 2 . Analyze : A ) Antibiotics stop day 5 B ) Defined Daily Doses Reads aloud , 1 ) narrow spectrum , 2 ) broad spectrum , 3 ) total two group ( Mann-Whitney U test ) C ) Hospitalization within 28 day first hospitalization year - two group ( Mann-Whitney U test ) . Doctor Jens-Ulrik Jensen stand analyzes . Statistics program `` SAS v. 9.1.3 '' use . Economics : The study fund participate department . Responsibility : The study conceive run doctor Pulmonary Medicine Department Department Clinical Pharmacology , Bispebjerg Hospital Department Clinical Microbiology , Hvidovre Hospital . Science Ethics : There thorough research ethic discussion project project emphasis assessment advantage disadvantage might participate patient society whole future . Conclusions A B discussion summarize : A . Advantages Disadvantages : The treat physician time opportunity start / continue antibiotic behandlling overall assessment whether PCT value . In addition , past , large study total &gt; 2000 patient , demonstrate drawback use antibiotic depend displayed value PCT patient hospitalize acute exacerbation COPD . Mortality hospitalization monitor study . However , may occur side effect blood sampling , usually transient ecchymosis blood sample site . If strategy result reduce consumption antibiotic , expect incidence antibiotic-associated adverse event decrease - benefit patient . B . Usefulness society : Based result study high degree certainty conclude whether new treatment strategy provide benefit future patient form reduce antibiotic consumption , less antibiotic associated adverse event , reduce resistance development / selection among bacteria overall low economic cost . Based consideration , believe project , project carry respect participate subject integrity . Quantity : It expect include 120 patient scientific study . Database : data ( case report form ) store archive Pulmonary Medicine Department 15 year . Create database information . Personally identifiable data present clinical hospital . During completion experiment provide essential health information subject 's state health . This subject inform , unless clearly opt consent form . The project report Data Protection Agency . Level : With blood sample ( 8 mL ) day 1 every 2 day intervention group ( `` active group '' ) , part routine blood sampling . At discharge stop blood patient attend blood discharge .</brief_summary>
