	<brief_summary>Despite improvement treatment-related morbidity mortality , esophageal cancer still one lethal malignancy . Accurate stag essential establish prognosis patient management . Staging help determine surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , combination , palliative approach appropriate . Endoscopic ultrasound technique become popular . At Notre Dame Hospital , Centre Hospitalier de L'Universite de Montreal , patient diagnose esophageal cancer undergo complete EUS staging . In selected patient , EUS follow EBUS procedure , order examine lymph node near far primary tumor amenable EBUS guide trans-bronchial biopsy . In patient malignant esophageal stricture , preform gentle balloon dilation 14 mm . It important realize achieve symptom resolution , rather allow passage scope . We hypothesize early report high perforation rate related unnecessary aggressive dilation . Thus far , successfully dilate 60 patient last four year ( 2009-2013 ) able pas scope complete examination vast majority patient morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Balloon Dilation Permit Complete Endoscopic Ultrasound Staging Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gold standard evaluate local extension esophageal cancer endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) . The tumor extension esophageal wall ( T stage ) best assess use EUS . Suspicious lymph node mediastinum lymph node basin drain tumor ( N stage ) biopsied esophagus fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) obtain pathologic confirmation . Computed tomography ( CT ) positron-emission tomography ( PET ) use assessment metastatic disease ( M stage ) . In selected patient liver lesion , EUS utilize biopsy confirm metastatic disease . In absence metastatic disease , local extent disease important factor make decision surgery alone , neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy follow surgery , surgery follow chemoradiation inoperability . A difficult situation encounter patient malignant stricture , EUS scope pass across tumor distal esophagus stomach . There several problem situation . The first inability ass complete T stage tumor . This associated T-staging . Also , mediastinal intra-abdominal lymph node distal tumor assess , also lead inaccurate staging ( N M understaging ) . Patients high grade malignant stricture bad prognosis , therefore accurate stag appropriate application therapeutic option become paramount provide optimal treatment plan population . To circumvent problem incomplete staging due tight malignant stricture , one option recently employ gentle dilation malignant stricture , enough allow passage scope . It important stress purpose relieve symptom dysphagia , rather allow passage scope evaluate TNM stage . There mixed result regard safety technique . The follow table summarizes result study evaluate dilation endoscopic stag esophageal cancer . The early report quote high complication rate 24 % , specifically related perforation10 . In current era experience gain endoscopic diagnostic therapeutic application , report patient safely undergoing dilatation permit complete endosonographic evaluation . The recent study report perforation series . Except study perform Pfau et al. , number quite small less 40 patient 3 study . Furthermore , one study Wallace et al . report change stag offer complete EUS examination . The study consist phase I clinical trial . All patient currently undergo esophageal cancer stag Division Thoracic Surgery CHUM approach potential enrolment study . This stag currently go within stag protocol esophageal cancer therefore change practise , however , patient refuse enrolment data include study database outcome use way research protocol . Patients malignant stricture precludes passage dedicate endosonographic scope comprise study group . In situation , over-the-wire balloon dilation perform 14 mm . Patients standard adult gastroscope traverse stricture , pediatric gastrosocpe utilized order allow tumor traversal guidewire placement stomach endoscopic visualization . This perform order avoid dilate tumor inadvertently cause perforation . Once dilation complete , complete EUS examination undertaken . EUS , follow EBUS select patient lymphadenopathy high mediastinal lymph node perform stag . All patient undergo upright chest x-rays following procedure order ass pneumoperitoneum pneumomediastinum . Patients discharge , usual , following procedure . Results discuss follow-up clinic appointment thoracic surgeon within 3 4 week procedure . Any procedure-related morbidity document post-procedural period well follow-up clinic . In patient send another hospital EUS stag esophageal cancer , treat followed CHUM , 30 day telephone interview perform assess complication 30-day post-procedure period . F. Data Points Collected - Age - Sex - Comorbidties - BMI - Tumor location - Tumor histology - CT stage - PET stage - EUS T stage - EUS N stage - EUS M stage - EUS lymph node FNA result - EBUS lymph node FNA result - Change treatment plan base complete EUS - Procedural morbidity relate staging procedure - 30-day morbidity relate staging procedure - Pathologic staging , available undergoing surgical resection Analysis focus : 1 . Ability complete endosonographic examination dilation 2 . Safety profile minimal dilation allow passage EUS scopes 3 . Change treatment plan base complete endosonographic examination esophageal cancer .</detailed_description>
