	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine cool neck patient ICH decrease brain temperature . In addition , investigator determine device improves delivery oxygen brain . A third goal determine cool neck lower intracranial pressure ( often times high patient ICH ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Cooling Patients With Excel Cryo Cooling System Intracerebral Hemorrhage ( ICH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized device efficacy trial . Patients &gt; 20cc Supratentorial ICH invasive brain temperature monitor ( either Licox Temperature sense intracranial pressure device ) enrol consent . The Excel Cryo Cooling System collar place around neck 20 patient two hour . The goal determine effectiveness device cool brain . The collar standard neck collar use patient neck surgery modification allow placement cool pack collar delivers cold . During study two hour , investigator collect data concern brain temperature , body temperature , brain oxygen level pressure head blood ( blood pressure ) . The investigator also collect demographic information ( i.e . age , gender , medical risk factor ) information regard current disease process .</detailed_description>
