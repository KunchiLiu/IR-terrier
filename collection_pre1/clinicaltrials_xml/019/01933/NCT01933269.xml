	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess relatively new PET ( Positron emission tomography ) radiotracer call FACBC assessment head neck cancer . FDG ( Flourine Deoxyglucose ) currently use PET image , limitation head neck cancer . These limitation include problem specificity , high background uptake normal structure , difficulty delineate intracranial invasion , need wait several week chemotherapy radiation image . As amino acid radiotracer , rather glucose radiotracer , FACBC overcome limitation . FACBC yet FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) approval , show promise initial work patient prostate cancer brain tumor . Dosimetry work FACBC perform Emory . Our study pilot study look 10 patient new diagnosis biopsy proven squamous cell carcinoma oral cavity able go definitive surgical resection ( ie , surgery without precede chemotherapy radiation ) . Patients must pre-surgical imaging , either contrast enhance CT , FDG PET , MRI . Patients consent participate receive one FACBC PET/CT neck , require low dose `` transmission '' CT neck , intravenous injection radiotracer , image neck last 1 hour . Patients lie still imaging time . Total participation time include set less 90 minute . Imaging result analyze compare conventional image well surgical pathology result</brief_summary>
