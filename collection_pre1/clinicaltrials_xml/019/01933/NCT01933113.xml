	<brief_summary>The study continuation clinical pilot study lateral hypothalamic area ( LHA ) deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) severe obesity . Patients meet enrollment criterion underwent stereotactic placement bilateral hypothalamic chronic stimulate electrode . The current trial continue monitor subject well objectively measure metabolic rate ( include energy expenditure , respiratory quotient , oxygen consumption , carbon dioxide production ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intent protocol continue monitor effect deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) lateral hypothalamic area ( LHA ) metabolic rate treatment chronic refractory obesity . Three subject previously implant IDE study West Virginia University . The subject continue monitor data gather weight loss , metabolism effect side effect time . The subject see often every month le every three month outpatient clinic . They weigh ask change overall health . Their stimulators interrogate use battery status . All device relate adverse event capture well non-device relate serious adverse event . In addition , subject utilize metabolic chamber Deltatrac II Metabolic Carts ( SensorMedics Corporation , Anaheim , California Datex-Ohmeda , Helsinki , Finland ) Pennington Biomedical Research Center ( PBRC ) , Baton Rouge , Louisiana objectively measure correlation metabolic rate various novel setting DBS one week period . The schedule metabolic test include : Day 0 baseline overnight chamber stimulation . Days 1-4 Resting metabolic rate ( RMR ) perform hourly variable LHS DBS setting . The setting change approximately every 15 minute DBS setting change . Day 4 overnight chamber ideal metabolic rate setting . After RMR test Day 4 , subject dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan perform assess body composition .</detailed_description>
