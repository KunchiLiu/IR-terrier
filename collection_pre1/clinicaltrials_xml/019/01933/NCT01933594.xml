	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Efficacy Romidepsin Combination With Antiretroviral Therapy HIV-Infected Adults With Suppressed Viral Load</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major challenge eradicate HIV-1 infection persistence virus long-lived cell , latently infected memory CD4 T cell . One approach eliminate HIV-1 reservoir activate viral replication latently infect CD4 T cell target cellular mechanism repress proviral transcription . Histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACis ) , RMD , induce HIV-1 expression increase acetylation facilitate transcriptional activation HIV-1 . RMD administer combination ART may serve important component strategy eradicate HIV-1 latent reservoir . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy single dose multiple dose administration RMD HIV-infected adult . Participants sequentially enrol four cohort randomly assign receive either RMD placebo . The cohort differ dose RMD give . Participants Cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 one intravenous ( IV ) infusion RMD placebo Day 0 . Participants Cohort 4 four IV infusion RMD placebo Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 . For participant Cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 , study duration 4 week . For participant Cohort 4 , study duration minimum 24 week maximum 48 week . Participants attend several study visit , may include physical examination , blood urine collection , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sampling , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) .</detailed_description>
