	<brief_title>A Study Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer Assess How Drug Eligard® , Affects Certain Markers Blood Urine , Which Are Indicators Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study explore effect Eligard® follow prostate cancer biomarkers : Testosterone serum , Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) serum , Prostate Cancer Antigen ( PCA3 score ) urine , PSA mRNA blood/Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ( PBMC ) , PCA3 mRNA blood/PBMC , Transmembrane protease , serine 2-Ets Related Gene ( TMPRSS2-ERG ) mRNA blood/PBMC A blood sample RNA analysis also collect stored future investigation patient give specific informed consent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Confirmed metastatic prostate cancer androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) indicate . Noncastrate level testosterone ( ≥ 8 nmol/L ( 230 ng/dL ) ) screen . Serum PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL screen . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) score 02 A life expectancy least 12 month . Is able tolerate injection study drug comply study requirement . Positive blood PSA mRNA screening . A positive PSA mRNA PBMCs ( define exceed Limit Detection [ LoD ] central lab assay , i.e . ≥ 10 copy per Polymerase Chain Reaction , PCR ) . History bilateral orchidectomy . History hormonal treatment/therapy GnRH agonist , GnRH antiagonist within 6 month enrolment . Treatment antiandrogens ( except use prevent testosterone flare , start 2 week prior Eligard injection , accord local treatment guideline ) , 5α reductase inhibitor , estrogens and/or investigational hormonederivative within 3 month enrolment 5times halflife , whichever longer . Any previous treatment chemotherapy treatment prostate cancer prior screen visit within 6 month prior screen cancer . Patients previously treat cancer hormonal therapy treatment stop due lack efficacy , progression disease lack tolerability . Previous treatment cancer ( include prostate cancer ) within 6 month prior enrolment : immunotherapy , external beam radiotherapy , brachytherapy , thermotherapy , biological response modifier ( e.g . cytokine ) . Known suspected spinal cord compression evidence spinal metastasis risk spinal compression . Uni bilateral ureteric obstruction . Requiring concomitant use antiandrogens course study ( except use prevent testosterone flare , start 2 week prior Eligard injection continue 3 week , accord local treatment guideline ) . Previous concomitant malignancy sit except effectively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer effectively treat malignancy remission least 5 year . Major surgery within 2 month prior enrolment . Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) screening . This apply subject Gilbert 's syndrome ( persistent recurrent hyperbilirubinemia predominantly unconjugated absence evidence hemolysis hepatic pathology ) , allow consultation sponsor . Participation clinical study within ≤ 1 month prior screen ( 5 half life drug investigation , whichever great ) . Not available followup assessment unable comply study requirement . Known suspect hypersensitivity leuprorelin acetate , GnRH agonists excipients Eligard . Male subject intend donate sperm within 9 month follow injection Eligard Male subject female spouses/partners childbearing potential NOT use highly effective contraception consist two form birth control ( one must barrier method ) start Screening continue 9 month time Eligard injection . Acceptable form include : Established use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) . Barrier method contraception : Condom OR Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/μL , platelet count &lt; 100,000/μL , hemoglobin &lt; 5.6 mmol/L ( 9 g/dL ) screening .
