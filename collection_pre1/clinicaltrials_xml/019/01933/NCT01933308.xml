Participants COPD often catch downward spiral go chronic airflow limitation invalidity poor quality life . Exercise training consider key successful pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) responsible much benefit associate intervention . However , despite current guideline recommend high-intensity exercise training . optimal exercise training protocol PR participant yet determine . Aims : The main goal propose research project determine optimal exercise training protocol PR . More specifically , objective compare effect continuous high-intensity training ( CT80 ) , continuous train ventilatory threshold ( CTVT ) , interval training ( IT ) various PR program outcome compare participant compliance three training regimen . Methods : One hundred twenty subject recruit . Participants meet eligibility criterion accept participate study randomize one three group : CT80 group , CTVT group , IT group . Session duration adjust total amount work perform per session comparable three group . Assessments make baseline ( week 0 ) , program completion ( week 12 ) , one year program start ( year 1 ) . The primary outcome measure short-term ( 12 week ) change exercise tolerance , measure endurance time constant-load cycling . Secondary outcome measure include : long-term ( 1 year ) change exercise tolerance ; short-term long-term change functional status , psychological status , cognition , health-related quality life ; average participant compliance target intensity throughout 12-week program ; long-term adherence exercise recommendation . Relevance : The propose research inform clinicians scientist regard exercise training protocol currently use PR optimal COPD participant examine short-term long-term impact physiological , functional , psychological , neuropsychological , behavioural quality life outcome .

	<detailed_description>The study prospective , randomize , multi-centre study 3 parallel-intervention arm blind outcome assessor . Subjects randomly allocate 1 3 exercise-training arm : CT80 , CTVT , IT . The duration training phase adjust arm total amount work equivalent arm . Training intensity ascertain heart rate ( HR ) monitor . The frequency length train chosen base late pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) guideline . Upon completion 12-week intervention , subject give standardized exercise recommendation follow home community 1yr follow-up . Assessments make baseline ( week 0 ) , program completion ( week 12 ) 1yr program initiation ( week 52 ) . Randomization group 6 subject occur block , 6 subject complete baseline assessment . The randomisation process consist computer-generated random list 3 treatment allocation block group 6 stratify site . The research assistant responsible randomization coordinate assessment intervention visit subject , assessor exercise-training supervisor . Subjects instructed talk group assignment assessor . Eligibility criterion mean differentiate COPD respiratory disease ensure clinical stability patient safety . Subjects recruit research assistant Sacré-Coeur Mount Sinai Hospital Montreal . Assessments take place Sacré-Coeur . Subjects complete intervention phase Sacré-Coeur Concordia University . To date , 36 subject complete study . As , order achieve target sample size , additional 84 subject randomize . We expect recruitment rate 25-30 % . Thus , approximately 300 patient screened meet recruitment goal . Given able screen 200 patient 2.5yrs active recruitment , anticipate additional 2.5yrs recruitment 2 site enable u reach target sample size . Follow-up measurement require additional 12months data collection time last patient randomize . Accordingly , anticipate total data collection last 3.5yrs . We estimate 10 % subject lose week 12 , number expect double week 52 . A symptom-limited incremental cycling exercise test perform week 0 rule presence cardiovascular co-morbidities . Subjects seat electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer ( Ergoselect 200P , Ergoline , Germany ) connect cardio-respiratory circuit mouthpiece ( Jaeger Oxycon Pro , CareFusion , Germany ) . After 3min unloaded pedalling , workload increase stepwise manner individual 's maximal capacity . Each step last 1min increment 5-10W use . Gas exchange parameter HR measure rest exercise breath-by-breath basis . The ventilatory threshold determine use V-slope method , computerized approach identify breakpoint carbon dioxide output-oxygen uptake relationship . Peak work rate define high work rate maintain pedal speed least 50rpm minimum 30sec . A constant-load cycling exercise test perform measure exercise tolerance week 0 , week 12 week 52 . Subjects seat ergometer connect cardiorespiratory circuit . After 3min unloaded pedalling , workload set 80 % peak work rate achieve incremental cycling test . Patients ask pedal workload long possible . Inspiratory capacity obtain every minute test evaluate degree dynamic lung hyperinflation . Dyspnea leg fatigue evaluate rest every minute test modify 10-point Borg scale . The final measure test endurance time , define duration pedal minimum 40rpm 80 % peak work rate . Field walk test felt reflective daily living activity laboratory test , thereby provide mean objectively evaluate functional status . An incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT ) first complete determine peak walk capacity week 0 : walk speed initially set 0.50m/sec increase 0.17m/sec every minute patient reach symptom-limited maximum . The endurance shuttle walk test perform week 0 , 12 52 measure change functional status : subject ask walk long possible constant , predetermine speed correspond 85 % peak oxygen uptake , predict ISWT . The final measure distance cover . Both test complete follow recommendation . Subjects ask complete psychosocial questionnaire measure variables know associated COPD positive response exercise intervention . Measures include 21-item BDI-II ass depressive symptom , 16-item ASI ass anxiety SES ass patient ' confidence ability successfully perform certain behaviour ( e.g. , exercise ) . In addition , Primary Care Evaluation Mental Disorders administer characterize subject detect common Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV disorder primary care setting . Dr. Lavoie charge administer psychological questionnaire ensure patient score clinical range properly refer follow . Subjects complete cognitive test measure variables know associated COPD positive response exercise intervention . This include measure global cognitive functioning ( MoCA ) , executive function ( TMT B verbal fluency ) , attention vigilance ( CPT ) , work memory ( WAIS-III ) , episodic verbal memory ( RAVLT ) visuospatial ability ( ROCF ) . Alternative version use avoid test-retest effect . Dr. Gagnon charge administer test ensure patient score clinical range properly refer follow . Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQL ) measure use generic disease-specific questionnaire . The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey ( SF-36 ) use obtain general HRQL score characterize study sample , generate summary score easily compare exist population norm across different disease population . To overcome less responsive nature generic instrument , also use CRQ , widespread disease-specific HRQL questionnaire measure patient ' dyspnoea , fatigue , emotional function mastery . Total score CRQ use measure change HRQL week 0 week 12 week 52 . HRQL questionnaires administer Dr. Lavoie . Compliance refers degree patient 's behaviour concurs instruction health care practitioner . Patient compliance train regimen define percent time spend prescribed train intensity 12-week program . This measure obtain Technogym ( Bike Med 700 CE-R LED ; Polar HR monitor computer ; CardioMemory software package ) allow second-by-second track individual exercise session . Compliance target intensity determine assess percent time spend within target HR range ( ±5beats/min ) train phase exercise session average 12-week program . Long-term exercise adherence refers individual 's free choice continue exercise recommend level . Adherence exercise recommendation measure exercise level achieve home community week 52 ( numerator ) divide recommended amount ( denominator ) . Exercise level achieve estimate 7-day activity record complete patient cod intensity use Compendium Physical Activities . The energy expend activity correspond ( exceed ) patient 's target intensity level compute form numerator . The recommended amount exercise calculate patient energy expend last week PR . Exercise adherence measure week 52 , subject ask complete 7-day activity record week 0 week 12 familiarize procedure . Spirometry , lung volume lung diffusion capacity CO obtain week 0 follow-up evaluation accord recommend technique . Values compare predict normal value Canadian prediction equation spirometric lung function Caucasian adults 20 90yrs age . The primary objective study compare impact CT80 , CTVT IT exercise tolerance measure 12-week intervention phase . Preliminary data analysis first 18 subject ( 6 arm ) show average improvement endurance time constant-load cycling ( ES=0.32 ) . Due interim analysis , α level sample size calculation adjust α spending function . Using Pocock , α spending function t=0.1765 ( 18 102 subject project ) , loss α calculate 0.01324 result new α 0.03676 . For power 0.80 α 0.03676 , would need 36 patients/group total sample size 108 see statistical difference across group . Due expect 10 % loss subject follow-up , 40 subjects/groups ( N=120 ) recruit . To examine between-group difference exercise tolerance week 0 week 12 , 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA perform , treatment group between-subjects factor 3 level time within-subjects factor 2 level . If significant interaction treatment group time detect , simple main effect test conduct identify time point difference treatment group significant .
