The hypothesis test 1 ) pretreatment aspart insulin prevent , least reduce , occurrence hypoglycemia 2 ) substitution fructose glucose test meal prevent , least reduce , occurrence hypoglycemia . Plasma glucose serum insulin sample four hour three test condition . The primary study endpoint occurrence plasma glucose &lt; 60 mg/dL test meal . The control meal compare insulin pre-treated test meal , separate comparison , fructose test meal . Secondary endpoint comparison control active treatment peak postprandial serum insulin , peak postprandial plasma glucose , nadir postprandial plasma glucose , 4-hr longitudinal course plasma glucose measurement .</detailed_description>
