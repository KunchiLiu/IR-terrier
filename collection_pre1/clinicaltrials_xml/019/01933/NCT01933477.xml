Women complete another study measurement visit third trimester within 1 week postpartum ( study measurement visit time coincide routine care appointment ) . At visit , additional questionnaire phlebotomy use collect study measure . Phase 3 study randomise trial strategy deliver ART woman postpartum period ( primary objective ) measurement secondary outcome postnatal period . Women enrol Phase 2 breastfeed infant approach participate trial routine postpartum clinic visit ( take place within 7 day birth standard postpartum care woman ) .

We estimate approximately 600 woman ART follow Phase 2 , approximately 480 eligible enrol Phase 3 randomize one two postpartum ART delivery strategy . Follow-up participant Phase 3 end 12 month postpartum . The total length participation vary base gestational age enrollment Phase 2 , range minimum approximately 52 week maximum approximately 80 week .</detailed_description>
