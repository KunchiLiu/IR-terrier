	<brief_summary>This trial divide two part , dose-escalation study ( phase 1 ) randomize study ( phase 2 ) . The purpose dose-escalation study ( phase 1 ) determine safety , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , efficacy TPI 287 combination Avastin ( bevacizumab ) subject glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) progress follow prior radiation therapy temozolomide ( TMZ ) . The purpose randomize study ( phase 2 ) determine safety efficacy phase 1 MTD TPI 287 combination bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone subject GBM progress follow prior radiation therapy TMZ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center trial phase 1/2 study conduct two sequential phase , phase 1 phase 2 . Phase 1 trial dose-escalation study safety , tolerability ( MTD ) , efficacy TPI 287 combination bevacizumab subject GBM progress follow prior radiation therapy TMZ . - All subject administer TPI 287 intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( target duration 1 hour ) every 3 week ( Days 1 22 42-day cycle ) bevacizumab 30 90 minute IV infusion every 2 week ( Days 1 , 15 , 29 42-day cycle ) . The subsequent cycle start 3 week last TPI 287 infusion 2 week last bevacizumab infusion , maintain every 3 week every 2 week schedule , respectively . - The dose TPI 287 escalate sequential dose cohort 3 6 subject , dose bevacizumab remain constant ( 10 mg/kg ) . The initial cohort 3 subject treat TPI 287 dose 140 mg/m2 . The next four dose level 150 , 160 , 170 , 180 mg/m2 . Dose level beyond 180 mg/m2 increase increment 20 mg/m2 ( i.e. , 200 , 220 , 240 mg/m2 , etc. ) . - Once dose level identify exceeds MTD , dose de-escalation use refine MTD . Specifically , 3 subject treat intermediate dose level , halfway dose level exceed MTD dose level immediately prior ( e.g. , 230 mg/m2 , 240 mg/m2 exceed MTD ) . - Subjects assign dose cohort order enrol ; randomization phase 1 . Approximately 20 32 subject plan enrollment phase 1 , depend dose level dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) observe . - Dose modification delay require described protocol . Subjects may continue treatment unless meet one discontinuation criterion outline protocol . Subjects discontinue prior complete Cycle 1 reason toxicity replace . - Adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication monitor throughout study . Subjects give diary record AEs concomitant medication take visit . Additional safety evaluation include physical examination ( include neurologic examination ) , Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) , weight ( body surface area , BSA ) , vital sign , hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis . - Efficacy evaluation include magnetic resonance image [ MRI , include pre post-gadolinium T1-weighted scan T2/fluid attenuate inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) image ] , corticosteroid usage , neurologic status ( measure neurologic exam KPS ) . Phase 2 trial randomize study safety efficacy phase 1 MTD TPI 287 combination bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone subject GBM progress follow prior radiation therapy TMZ . - Sixty subject randomize 1:1 receive either TPI 287 combination bevacizumab bevacizumab alone . - For combination arm , subject administer TPI 287 IV infusion ( target duration 1 hour ) every 3 week ( Days 1 22 42-day cycle ) bevacizumab 30 90 minute IV infusion every 2 week ( Days 1 , 15 , 29 42-day cycle ) . The dose TPI 287 MTD determine phase 1 , dose bevacizumab phase 1 ( 10 mg/kg ) . - Subjects randomized bevacizumab alone arm administer 10 mg/kg bevacizumab 30 90 minute IV infusion every 2 week ( Days 1 , 15 , 29 42-day cycle ) . - The dose modification delay require phase 1 apply phase 2 . Subjects may continue treatment unless meet one discontinuation criterion outline protocol . There subject replacement phase 2 trial . - The safety efficacy evaluation phase 2 phase 1 . In addition , subject participate phase 2 telephone every two month follow final study visit ( 4 week last dose study drug ) two year randomization follow survival . - Subjects participate phase 1 trial eligible participate phase 2 trial .</detailed_description>
