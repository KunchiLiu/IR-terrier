	<brief_summary>Dry eye clinical research limit follow disease progression . While large catalogue test , corneal stain grading , tear break time ( TBUT ) Schirmer 's test , available , objective assessment demonstrate poor moderate repeatability . Among assessment , TBUT best repeatability Schirmer 's test show good repeatability severe form disease.1 As , currently , research outcome base subjective patient complaint rather objective assessment condition . LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer ( LipiView ) HSA-approved image device ability assess optical interference pattern produce light reflect tear film safe non-invasive manner.2 Software analysis image measure tear LLT , use objectively quantify diagnosis lipid-deficient dry eye . This current study aim investigative inter intra-examiner reproducibility measure tear lipid layer thickness ( LLT ) LipiView , use current clinical setting . LipiView evaluate reproducibility measure tear lipid layer thickness . The study also assess correlation magnitude tear LLT inter intra-examiner reproducibility LipiView . Once method find repeatable , used future clinical setting trial additional tool investigate dry eye treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct compliance protocol , SGCP applicable regulatory requirement . Dry eye condition affect 5-35 % population.11 Common symptom condition include eye irritation , heaviness eyelid , visual disturbance , tear light sensitivity.12 This significantly impact quality life vision dry eye patient . In addition , significant socioeconomic burden . In 2009 , 54,051 patient sought treatment dry eye Singapore National Eye Centre ( SNEC ) . In total , cost dry eye medication amount $ 181,354.17.14 Additionally , dry eye affect work productivity add socioeconomic burden.15 Currently , diagnosis assessment dry eye hinder test poor repeatability , cause discomfort due invasiveness . As result clinical study involve dry eye treatment rely symptomatic improvement primary outcome measure . However , symptomatic improvement poor measure determine treatment effectiveness disease progression , eye becomes desensitize nerve damage . Also , common patient feel reduction discomfort eye objective improvement note clinician . An assessment base symptom alone therefore inappropriate.13 Over last year , SNEC/SERI build dedicate team dry eye researcher trial evaluation diagnostic device . There increase interest internationally , especially industry , partner u test commercial product . The LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer HSA-approved image device allows clinician evaluate characteristic thickness tear lipid layer thickness ( LLT ) safe non-invasive manner . The device utilize white light LED source direct tear film inferior corneal region . Reflected light capture high resolution camera optical inference pattern evaluate software determine LLT . 2 It also find correlate dry eye diagnostic test , tear film break-up time ( TBUT ) , Schirmer 's test corneal stain 3,4,5,6 . LLT also report well correlate symptom objective dry eye test . 2 While several study investigate show association dry eye syndrome low LLT 2,7,8,9 , know LipiView would able make reproducible measurement LLT objective diagnosis dry eye syndrome . Clinical importance Should modality image show repeatable , incorporated current protocol/workflow assessment monitoring dry eye treatment progress centre , well enhance capability perform clinical trial increase international reputation . Study Objectives Purpose The primary purpose evaluate intra-examiner repeatability LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer ( LipiView ) image tear lipid layer thickness . Study design : Prospective study Rationale : Repeatability important issue objective assessment dry eye . There lack study investigate LipiView assessment tear film lipid layer thickness dry eye . LipiView potentially useful non-invasive procedure objective measurement dry eye . Methods : Participants target sample size 20 healthy volunteer recruit study . During recruitment , simple questionnaire give confirm absence dry eye symptom . Each volunteer also give study serial number ensure anonymity . All 20 volunteer participate LipiView repeatability inter-rater agreement study . Visit schedule One visit require participant . Duration study : 10 month . Procedures : 1 . Assessment Dry Eye Symptoms Participants ask score fill dry eye questionnaire assess symptomatic severity dry eye participant extent disruption daily activity . Basic biodata age , race , gender also record . 2 . LipiView Ocular Surface Interferometer Tear Lipid Layer Thickness Measurement During measurement eye , participant place chin chin rest look single white light source 30 second . During period , participant encourage blink freely comfortable rate assessor measure LLT . Afterwards , aforementioned step repeat eye another assessor 5 minute interval . Assessor 1 perform measurement time 0 min , 10min 20min Assessor 2 perform measurement time 5 min , 15 min , 25min . Similar step would take eye . Therefore , 12 measurement would take altogether per participant . Between measurement , participant advise rub touch eye , instill eye drop ointment . Assessment fluorescein tear break time corneal staining conduct LipiView LLT measurement . 3 . Fluorescein Dye Tear Break-up Time ( TBUT ) Fluorescein dye introduce onto low eyelid wet fluorescein strip . The tear film observe blue light use slit lamp point break . The time previous blink break tear film record near second . 4 . Fluorescein Dye Corneal Staining After fluorescein dye introduce , cornea examine green stain indicate epithelial erosion , sign damage due dryness . The number green stain location cornea ( superior , central , inferior , temporal , nasal field ) record .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Volunteers medically fit willing participate study . No eye surgery do within previous 3 month Active ocular surface condition infection pterygium may affect tear film stability . Any specified reason determine clinical investigator .</criteria>
