	<brief_summary>A phase 2 , open-label randomize , multicenter trial compare CC-486 combination Abraxane administer weekly respect overall survival , objective tumor response rate Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) participant diagnose metastatic malignant melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Efficacy Safety CC-486 With Nab-Paclitaxel Versus Nab-Paclitaxel Patients With Chemotherapy naïve Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist follow phase : - Screening ( Baseline ) Assessments : Performed within 21 day randomization . - Randomization : Subjects randomize within 21 day start Baseline assessment . - Treatment : Therapy may continue absence clinically significant disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Response Assessments : Subjects evaluate investigator CR , PR , stable progressive disease every 6 week start treatment progressive disease document . Responders subject stable disease ( SD ) continue study unless develop unacceptable toxicity , start new anticancer therapy , withdrawal consent , physician decision death . - End Study ( EOS ) /Treatment Evaluation : At time subject remove study , laboratory clinical evaluation perform . - Follow-up Disease Progression : - Subjects stop treatment prior develop disease progression follow without treatment progressive disease document treat physician feel additional treatment require . - Follow-up Survival : - Post study , subject survival status monitor monthly basis 6 month discontinuation study every 3 month thereafter , death study termination subject .</detailed_description>
