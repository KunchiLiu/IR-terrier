	<brief_summary>Background : - The intestine , mouth , skin contain billion bacteria fungi . Every person body contain microorganism like . They normally make people sick . Researchers interested microorganism change person hospitalize . They want find change take place hospitalization ( treatment use change medical condition ) person biology ( immune system ) . Objectives : - To understand microorganism likely spread hospital affect spread . Eligibility : - People 2 year age go inpatient National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( NIHCC ) least 1 week . Design : - Clinicians take sample participant day long hospitalize NIHCC . &lt; TAB &gt; - Blood take needle arm . This do , unless participant get certain infection . - Swabs take cotton swab , rectal area , groin , throat , armpit , possibly area . - Participants may give stool sample ask spit cup . - Clinicians collect information participant medical record . They may request sample tissue leave procedure already schedule NIHCC . - After participant leave NIHCC , sample may take return follow-up visit hospitalization , 2 year . They return follow-up study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Human Microbiome Clinical Center Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal protocol explore change microbial community course hospital care , determine extent alteration affect whether hospitalized patient become colonized nosocomial bacteria . The study enable collection clinical specimen associate medical data evaluate natural history , epidemiology , genomics patient expect hospitalized least seven day . Biological specimen include stool , sputum , swab take Clinical Center inpatients least 2 year age frequently daily discharge , follow-up visit 2 year date enrollment . To understand dynamic fecal microbiota hospitalize patient , protocol ass full complement microbial-host-environmental contribution include : ( 1 ) microbial genome community ; ( 2 ) patient genotype , underlie medical condition , medical treatment ; ( 3 ) hospital practice environment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals must meet follow inclusion criterion participate study : Be inpatient NIH CC expect hospitalization least 48 hour beyond date referral . Be 2 year age old Allow storage tissue sample future analysis . Allow genetic test body fluid , tissue specimen . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A patient eligible he/she condition , investigator opinion , place patient undue risk participate study .</criteria>
