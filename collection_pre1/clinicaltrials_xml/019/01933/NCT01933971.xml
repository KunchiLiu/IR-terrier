	<brief_summary>Study rationale : Bio-ker develop new formulation filgrastim BK0023 active content Neupogen® . BK0023 expect tolerability profile clinical effect Neupogen® control myelo-toxicity induced chemotherapy give treatment solid haematological tumour . It worth note production manufacturing procedure allow reduction drug cost thus likely pharmacoeconomic advantage . The study aim investigate pharmacodynamic equivalence pharmacokinetic bioequivalence new BK0023 injectable formulation filgrastim 0.3 mg/mL Bio-Ker S.r.l . vs. comparator ( Neupogen® 0.3 mg/mL , Dompé Biotec S.p.A. , Italy ) . Healthy male subject receive test reference dose 2.5 5 µg/kg/day 7 consecutive day dose 10 µg/kg/day 5 consecutive day accord randomised cross-over design . Pharmacodynamics , pharmacokinetics safety BK0023 injectable formulation 0.3 mg/mL Neupogen® 0.3 mg/mL , administer 2 consecutive period wash-out least 28 day elapse last injection period I first period II , compare . Study design : Single multiple escalate dose , double-blind , randomised , two-way cross-over , pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic bioequivalence study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Dose-response , Pharmacodynamic Pharmacokinetic Bioequivalence Filgrastim Healthy Male Volunteers After Single Multiple-dose Subcutaneous Administration Test Injectable Formulation BK0023 vs. Neupogen®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first part study , 16 healthy male subject include dose group receive test reference product accord cross-over design . After end second period dose group ( completion cross-over period dose group ) pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic primary parameter calculate . The blind temporarily break one statistician ad interim analysis primary parameter perform conclusion treatment 16 subject dose group ( result disclose ) aim re-calculate sample size conclude study necessary sufficient number subject dose regimen . The study design choose accord internationally recognise guideline pharmacokinetics study accordance EMEA guidance similar medicinal product contain recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , annexed guideline similar biological medicinal product contain biotechnology-derived protein active substance : non-clinical clinical issue . A clinical development plan include study outline also submit EMEA , examine documentation give advice present study design . A multiple-dose design choose instead single-dose design , since G-CSF pharmacokinetics non linear due 2 reason : non-proportional increase dose time dependent non-linearity . However , pharmacodynamic equivalence pharmacokinetic bioequivalence test 1st last dose multiple dose treatment . Since effect r-h-met-G-CSF directly measure pharmacodynamic response , i.e . increase absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) development peripheral blood cell ( CD34+ cell ) , parameter evaluate equivalence testing . Dose level 2.5 5 μg/kg/day choose pharmacodynamic equivalence , since literature data show clear dose-response relationship term pharmacodynamic parameter range . The 10 μg/kg/day dose chosen make investigated range relevant respect clinical indication usual praxis Neupogen® . Moreover , subcutaneous administration chosen , since administration route commonly use clinical setting .</detailed_description>
