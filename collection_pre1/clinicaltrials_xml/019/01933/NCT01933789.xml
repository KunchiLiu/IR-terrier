Eligible patient ( 6 per clinician , goal n=500 ) include chronic , life-limiting illness . Family member patient interdisciplinary team member primary clinician may participate . Primary clinician randomize intervention usual care . The intervention 's effectiveness compare usual care use validate self-report questionnaire collect longitudinally ( baseline/enrollment , within 2 week target visit , 3 month , 6 month ) patient family .
