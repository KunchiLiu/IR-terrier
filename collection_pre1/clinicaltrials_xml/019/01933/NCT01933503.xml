	<brief_title>Single Dose Multiple Dose Trial Assess Pharmacokinetics Obeticholic Acid ( OCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty-four eligible subject enrol randomize 1 3 treatment group ( 5 mg , 10 mg , 25 mg ) treatment ratio 1:1:1 less ratio 1:1 female : male subject . The study comprise single dose multiple dose phase . The randomized dose administer single dose phase subject 's dose level multiple dose phase . A single dose OCA ( 5 mg , 10 mg , 25 mg ) administer Day 1 . PK , safety , tolerability assess 3 day . On Day 4 , multiple dose phase begin dose level ( 5 mg , 10 mg , 25 mg ) , subject receive OCA daily 14 day . PK , safety , tolerability assess 2 week clinical site follow last investigational product ( IP ) dose Day 17 . Subjects confine inpatient trial site Day 0 morning Day 30 .
