Pregnant nursing mother woman intend become pregnant next three year All patient prestudy liver function test , PT/PPT , platelet , hematocrit , renal function laboratory test do . Only patient whose value normal range determine laboratory norm base age sex allow participate . Use systemic chemotherapeutic antimitotic medication within three month study start date due possibility interference bone marrow procedure Any patient history active malignancy Use steroid within three month study start date , would suggest highly active disease state History cirrhosis due increase risk central nervous system ( CNS ) infection Poorly control hypertension increase risk stroke CNS hemorrhage . Specifically , patient systolic blood pressure value ≥ 145 mm/Hg diastolic blood pressure value ≥ 95 mm/Hg exclude study participation . History thyroid disorder endocrine disorder hormone influence cell growth History central nervous system infection immunodeficiency syndrome due increase risk CNS infection Preexisting blood disease ( bone marrow hypoplasia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , significant anemia ) due invasive nature bonemarrow aspiration Previous current history coagulation disorder Any metal body , contraindicate MRI study Allergy antibiotic use study , e.g . tobramycin , vancomycin , gentamicin Patients alcohol substance abuse problem Other major disease , opinion Principal Investigator , would preclude participation study Patients HBV , HCV , syphilis , HIV1 , HIV2 . Any evidence significant cognitive dysfunction base screen history physical examination would preclude give truly informed consent Patients enrol another clinical trial MS treatment receive study drug/biologics within last 6 month</criteria>
