	<brief_summary>Neuromuscular block drug ( NMBDs ) provide anesthesiologist powerful intraoperative tool , use carry potential risk serious postoperative complication . NMBD-induced muscle weakness lingers postoperative period , know postoperative residual curarization ( PORC ) , present many 40 % patient receive neuromuscular blocking agent . The Post Anesthesia Care Unit introduce monitor part standard care . This study collect data patient receive NMBDs examine impact monitoring incidence PORC . Our study design test follow hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : The initiation quantitative TOF monitoring part standard PACU entry evaluation change practitioner behavior manner decrease incidence PORC surgical patient VUMC . Hypothesis 2 : The initiation routine TOF monitoring program decrease incidence short- long-term postoperative complication VUMC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular block drug ( NMBDs ) provide anesthesiologist powerful intraoperative tool , use carry potential risk serious postoperative complication . NMBD-induced muscle weakness lingers postoperative period , know postoperative residual curarization ( PORC ) , present many 40 % patient receive neuromuscular blocking agent . Physiological data suggest PORC impair normal respiratory function , compel evidence suggest PORC impairs clinical recovery immediate postoperative period prolongs PACU length stay . However , despite widespread use NMBDs frequent occurrence PORC , limitation literature prevent understanding full impact clinical outcome . This study collect data patient receive NMBDs examine impact monitoring incidence PORC . The incidence PORC postoperative complication introduction monitoring PACU determine measure TOF ratio track postoperative outcome surgical patient time .</detailed_description>
