	<brief_summary>Infections acquire patient hospital major cause illness death worldwide , particularly hospital limit resource . Simple hygiene measure , include improved hand hygiene ( particularly increase use alcohol-based hand rub ) healthcare worker ( HCWs ) physical contact patient , think amongst effective way reduce infection . However , hospital hand hygiene practice poorly improve hand hygiene behavior amongst hospital staff find difficult . This study aim evaluate impact multimodal intervention improve hand hygiene amongst health care worker accordance WHO Guidelines Hand Hygiene Health Care . The research design prospective step wedge trial use in-patient ward 1,000 bed hospital locate Northeast Thailand ( Sappasitthiprasong hospital , Ubon Ratchatani ) . A stepped wedge design type cluster randomize control trial appropriate prior reason believe intervention beneficial ( opposed equipoise ) impractical deliver intervention study unit simultaneously . Both condition hold . The intervention include educational visit healthcare worker , improve reminder workplace , audit feedback social marketing aim induce behavioural cultural change relation hand hygiene . The intervention deliver infection control team infection control ward nurse ( ICWNs ) receive additional training . The primary outcome directly observe hand hygiene compliance . Secondary outcome include incidence density hospital-associated bloodstream urinary tract infection specify multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria , incidence density hospital-associated bloodstream urinary tract infection non-multiply antibiotic resistant bacteria , total patient mortality rate , ward-based consumption alcohol hand rub soap ( proxy hand hygiene compliance ) . Results study immediately generalisable resource-constrained hospital Thailand . The research also much wide international significance methodologically sound evaluation impact hand hygiene intervention hospital . Moreover , finding provide essential information subsequent work economic evaluation infection control intervention determine circumstance intervention likely cost-effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Healthcare-associated infection ( HCAIs ) global problem major source preventable morbidity mortality worldwide , particularly low middle income country . A recent review estimate pooled prevalence HCAI develop country ( define Organisation Economic Co-operation Development ( OECD ) low middle income country ) 15.5 per 100 patient , highlight need improve infection control practice . Rates surgical site infection report range 12 39 % develop country compare 2 5 % developed country rate HCAI neonates find 12 time higher develop country . Mortality due infection develop country find greatly exceed developed country . There , however , evidence quasi experimental research concert sometimes low-cost intervention able greatly reduce hospital transmission prevalence multi-drug resistant organism ( MDROs ) , result improve patient outcome . Improved hand hygiene ( HH ) widely believe single effective intervention . However 2010 Cochrane review highlight lack methodologically sound research evaluate intervention improve HH : four study meet minimum inclusion criterion one study come low middle income country ( randomise trial educational intervention nurse China ) . Moreover , recent review identify need strong evidence link improve HH compliance reduction HCAIs ( currently evidence base observational study ) . While comprehensive hospital infection control guideline propose study site , Sappasithiprasong hospital , recent observational study team carry hospital indicate poor HH compliance , 5 % health-care worker ( HCWs ) ( manuscript preparation ) . Previous data collect team suggest hospital infection control guideline may implement consistently due , part , resource constraint [ 5 ] . More recent qualitative research carry Sappasithiprasong hospital cause poor hand hygiene compliance identify several obstacle , highlight particular lack knowledge appropriate hand hygiene behaviour . Available evidence suggest hand hygiene promotion ( HHP ) multimodal intervention effective approach improve HCW hand hygiene compliance [ 6 ] . While formal evaluation intervention use strong study design lower middle income country lack , intervention relatively inexpensive think likely cost-effective ( potentially cost-saving result reduce infection rate ) . Again , however , formal economic evaluation outside high income country lack . This approach promote WHO guideline identifies five moment HH ( patient contact , aseptic procedure , body fluid exposure , touch patient , touch patient 's surroundings ) . These guideline aim encourage good HH compliance real world recommend multimodal HHP strategy make use five component : 1 ) system change ( example , change system ensure alcohol-based hand-rub readily available wherever whenever need ) , 2 ) training education , 3 ) observation feedback , 4 ) reminder hospital , 5 ) hospital safety climate . Adapting guideline local condition important , make use initial qualitative research . This identify important local barrier achieve high level HH compliance . Another major issue improve HH behaviour hospital HCWs sustainability . While many study report immediate improvement HH follow intervention , sustain improvement much challenge another area research limit . In conclusion , need methodologically rigorous research evaluate impact multimodal intervention base WHO recommendations short longer-term consider outcome HH compliance , preventable HCAIs . The need research great resource-constrained setting low middle income country burden disease due healthcare associate infection great . Findings research also inform economic evaluation need determine condition intervention cost-effective .</detailed_description>
