	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Dabrafenib + Trametinib AJCC Stage IIIB-C BRAF V600 Mutation Positive Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neoadjuvant therapy demonstrate improve outcome management patient multiple different solid tumour . The advantage neoadjuvant therapy melanoma provide vivo assessment tumour responsiveness systemic therapy , potentially eradicate micrometastatic disease , may improve surgical result . It also provide opportunity obtain tumour sample treatment study variation response effect treatment tumour characteristic . This pilot study explore pathological response rate , Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response rate biomarkers 12-week duration neoadjuvant therapy combine MAP kinase inhibition ( MAPKi ) dabrafenib trametinib establish guideline expand Phase II III study . The biomarker component study compare pre-treatment ( PRE ) day 4-7 , 'early treatment ' biopsy ( EDT ) 12 week lymphadenectomy sample ( POST ) . The tissue interrogate immunologic , proteomic genetic ( RNA DNA ) feature change tissue blood . The baseline PRE specimen consist least two core , excisional incisional biopsy take prior commence combine dabrafenib trametinib . The EDT specimen consist least two core , excisional incisional biopsy take day 4-7 , early commencing combine dabrafenib trametinib . The POST specimen complete lymph node dissection specimen perform 12 week treatment combine dabrafenib trametinib . The EDT specimen provide unique opportunity investigate early change occur melanoma tumour MAPK inhibitor may set late resistance complete response , may amenable therapeutic manipulation . For example , EDT sample collect patient treat single agent BRAF inhibitor show increased T cell infiltrate associate well response lesion . The T cell infiltrate also associate increased expression melanoma antigen , decrease immunosuppressive cytokine [ interleukin ( IL ) -6 IL-8 ] increase marker T-cell cytotoxicity . Additional study show expected suppression pERK , pair PRE-EDT sample , decrease ERK suppression associate well RECIST response . There report effect BRAF MEK inhibitor single agent combination respond melanoma tissue take 15 day commencement treatment . As median PFS combination dabrafenib trametinib 9.4 month , &gt; 95 % POST sample respond , provide opportunity 1 ) compare respond POST EDT sample ( baseline PRE sample prior treatment ) investigate signal pathway ( determine RNA gene expression protein expression ) alter time , 2 ) change signal pathway correlate clinical pathological response . Study treatment continue adjuvant therapy . The goal improve cure rate surgery eradication occult micrometastatic disease . Notable success achieve oncology highly effective therapy available advanced stage disease ( e.g. , breast cancer , Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , embryonal tumour , osteosarcoma ) . High-risk , resected BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma represent another attractive setting test paradigm since : 1 ) population high risk relapse death without therapy 2 ) BRAF/MAP-ERK kinase combination highly effective metastatic setting target population likely benefit . The study design test efficacy study treatment neoadjuvant adjuvant setting first time patient population . Approximately 168 patient receive combination therapy dabrafenib trametinib propose study dos ( 150 mg BID dabrafenib 2 mg daily trametinib ) median follow-up time 12.8 month . In dose-escalation phase , PFS long group receive high dos dabrafenib trametinib acceptable safety profile . Based data combination 150 mg BID dabrafenib 2.0 mg daily trametinib select study . Mature randomize phase 2 trial ( Part C Figure 2 ) median follow 14.1 month show high response rate ( 76 % versus 54 % , p=0.03 ) long median PFS ( 9.4 month vs 5.8 month , hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.39 , p &lt; 0.001 ) MAPK inhibitor-naïve patient combination full dose dabrafenib trametinib compare dabrafenib monotherapy . The duration therapy ( 12 month ) base upon expert consensus exceed administer pivotal study adjuvant treatment similar population treatment range 12 60 month . In absence reliable biomarker minimal residual disease , empiric dose duration much short predict median relapse free interval ( median 15 month ) may increase risk treatment failure . The design include predictive biomarkers may allow refinement dose phase III study design complete . Safety continuous dose dabrafenib trametinib year monotherapies establish along preliminary safety combination dose similar interval . Safety precaution include clear guideline management toxicity , include enhance surveillance adverse event special interest along instruction dose modification . The inclusion/exclusion criterion also serve minimize participation great risk know suspected toxicity combination therapy . Neoadjuvant study patient macroscopic stage III melanoma perform use immunotherapy interferon ipilimumab . Interferon activity stage IV melanoma , yet objective clinical response 11 17 ( 55 % ) patient stage III melanoma give neoadjuvantly . Furthermore , 3/17 ( 15 % ) complete pathological response . Clinical responder significantly great increase endotumoral CD11c CD3 cell significantly great decrease endotumoral CD83 cell compare nonresponders . In contrast , ipilimumab confers overall survival benefit patient stage IV melanoma vaccine chemotherapy , however objective response rate low 11-15 % . In neoadjuvant study macroscopic stage III melanoma , pathological response report , however objective clinical response observe 3/29 ( 10 % ) patient . Immune infiltrate cell note tumours treatment ipilimumab , result correlate biomarker change response await . In stage IV melanoma patient , 73 % patient respond BRAF inhibitor , achieve RECIST response time first scan ( 8 week ) , median time best response 12 week poor prognosis patient . The progression free survival ( PFS ) combination 9.4 month , &lt; 5 % patient progression best RECIST response . Therefore , 12 week chosen period neoadjuvant combination therapy optimise tumour shrinkage , without compromise patient safety . Surgeons Melanoma Institute Australia perform approximately 120 lymphadenectomies year patient palpable lymphadenopathy . The sample size 35 patient achievable within anticipated 12 18 month recruitment phase . Neoadjuvant therapy combine dabrafenib + trametinib high-risk melanoma patient bulky regional stage IIIB-C lymphadenopathy may result improved rate duration local control reduce surgical morbidity . Pyrexia Sub-Study Combined therapy dabrafenib trametinib associate pyrexia two-thirds patient . There identifiable clinical correlate pyrexia mechanism remain unknown . Management involve use corticosteroid 25 % case . Further investigation drug-associated pyrexia urgently require , particularly facilitate use drug adjuvant setting . The context single institution study close uniform patient monitoring provide ideal opportunity study drug-induced pyrexia , mechanism , prevention management , correlation pyrexia parent drug metabolite plasma level compare develop pyrexia .</detailed_description>
