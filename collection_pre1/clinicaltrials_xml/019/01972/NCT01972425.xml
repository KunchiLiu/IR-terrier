	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient whose lung support breathe machine ( ventilator ) commonly develop new lung infection , call ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . Because VAP often fatal , antibiotic administer whenever suspect . However VAP hard distinguish several non-infective lung condition patient suspect VAP pneumonia . Therefore many patient receive unnecessary antibiotic several day , promote emergence 'superbugs ' . Laboratory test result diagnose VAP typically reach doctor 3 day . A simple test rapidly confidently exclude VAP improve patient care , reduce unnecessary antibiotic decrease cost . We recently show low level specific proteins fluid lung patient suspect VAP effectively exclude VAP , use test may yield result within 6 hour . The test use extension exist technology produce commercial partner Becton Dickinson ( BD ) Biosciences . Our previous finding derive single hospital 's intensive care unit . We recently confirm find across many intensive care unit , help show test use 'real life ' . The aim study take new test next step determine whether improve care patient reduce amount unnecessary antibiotic prescribe . This do use 'randomised controlled trial ' , best tool scientifically test new diagnostic test . To shall identify patient suspect VAP , lung sample - half patient receive 'usual care ' suspect VAP , half new test perform lung fluid . If new test suggest lung infection , doctor ask consider give antibiotic . We shall test much antibiotic give group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker-based Exclusion VAP Improved Antibiotic Stewardship</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VAP associate high mortality nosocomial infection . Several non-infective condition mimic VAP significant infection usually confirm less 40 % suspected case . No test reliably exclude VAP point clinical suspicion , microbiological result typically return 3 day later . Consequently , empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic routinely administer , patient suspect VAP pneumonia . Using cytometric bead array ( CBA ) technology , demonstrate IL-1b bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) use exclude VAP single centre derivation study multi-centre validation study . A combination IL-1b IL-8 exclude VAP sensitivity 100 % , specificity 44.3 % negative predictive value 1 . This randomise controlled trial determine whether biomarker-based recommendation antibiotic ( versus routine use antibiotic ) improve antibiotic stewardship suspect VAP . This study test hypothesis 'biomarker-guided recommendation antibiotic ' improve antibiotic stewardship patient suspect VAP maintain equivalent patient outcome . Recruitment RCT end BAL perform 210 patient . For regulatory purpose , study continue follow data collect 210th patient . Safety measure make relation bronchoscopy BAL include SaO2 , heart rate , BP , PaO2 : FiO2 procedure . Adverse event consider related antibiotic also record . SAE , describe , record . Markers inflammation measure BALF include limited IL-1b IL-8 . Healthcare resource use estimate critical care length stay ( level 3 level 2 care ) hospital length stay . Data collect randomisation hospital discharge death , whichever occur first , maximum 56 day . The sample size base change frequency distribution AFD towards patient AFD 7 day follow BAL . Using model outline Study Protocol exemplars different effect size , would judge effect size 0.7 would represent important clinical difference biomarker-guided care . From exploration , power calculation judge balance detectable effect size feasible recruitment , basis detect effect size 0.0797 , 90 patient require per study arm . Allowing 15 % drop ( non-evaluable data case problem run biomarker assay etc ) , total sample size 210 patient require . Data collect process implement trial . In situation patient biomarker result exclude VAP ICU consultant follow recommendation , ICU consultant ask complete questionnaire give information recommendation follow . Randomisation perform designate researcher train use biomarker kit . The randomisation perform use web-based randomisation service host NCTU . Patients randomise 'biomarker-guided recommendation antibiotic ' 'routine use antibiotic ' 1:1 ratio stratification site . Permuted block variable length use disclose investigator . On enrolment research team inform researcher BAL perform allow researcher randomise patient . Each patient assign unique identification number technician enter randomisation system . The patient allocate either study arm accordance randomisation schedule . The online randomisation service instruct researcher either 'ANALYSE THE SAMPLE ON ARRIVAL ' ( ie . 'biomarker-guided recommendation antibiotic ' group ) 'DO NOT ANALYSE THE SAMPLE ON ARRIVAL ' ( ie . 'Routine use antibiotic ' group ) . The randomisation service automatically confirm randomisation detail NCTU email researcher also send BALF biomarker result NCTU use unique identifier . Since recruited patient undergo study procedure clinical team initially blind study arm . The researcher perform randomisation either process sample . For 6 hour take process sample CBA , clinical team blind study arm . Following period clinical team un-blinded researcher inform clinical team biomarker result biomarker test perform . A within-trial cost analysis undertaken assess impact biomarker-based guidance VAP management hospital resource use point randomisation hospital discharge death , whichever occur first , maximum 56 day . Patient-level hospital resource use estimate length ICU stay length hospital stay . Mean hospital resource use associate cost estimate intervention standard care group compare . Multiple regression analysis perform examine patient factor potentially associate cost . Robustness result evaluate use sensitivity analysis . Data receive NCTU process per CTU SOPs , include enter data secure central database . Responsibility maintenance database rest study manager . The trial manage Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit ( NCTU ) . The Principal Investigators responsible day-to-day study conduct site . NCTU provide day-to-day support , provide trial training routine monitoring visit . Quality control maintain adherence NCTU SOPs , study protocol , principle GCP , research governance clinical trial regulation . An independent data monitoring ethic committee ( DMEC ) convene undertake independent review . The purpose committee monitor efficacy safety endpoint . Only DMEC access unblinded study data . The committee meet least 3 time , start , middle completion study . At first meeting , DMEC discuss advise inclusion interim analysis possible adoption formal stopping rule efficacy safety . A Trial Steering Committee ( TSC ) establish provide overall supervision trial . The committee meet baseline regular interval recruitment . Monitoring study conduct data collect performed combination central review site monitor visit ensure study conduct accordance GCP . Study site monitoring undertaken NCTU . The main area focus include consent , serious adverse event essential document study file . All monitoring finding report followed-up appropriate person timely manner . The study may subject inspection audit Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust remit sponsor , regulatory body ensure adherence GCP .
