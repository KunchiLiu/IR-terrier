	<brief_summary>SPECT currently dominant clinical test diagnostic prognostic purpose well therapeutic decision-making . Given shortage nuclear reactor-produced Tc , advance use non-isotope base image modality potential change standard care patient CAD one technics ( CMR , CT , Stress echocardiography ) distinct potential advantage SPECT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-isotope Based Imaging Modalities v Technetium-99m Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( 99mTcSPECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtain well understand clinical utility advance non-isotope-based imaging modality detect relevant CAD potential alternative SPECT . Approximately 450 subject enrol total . Three group 150 patient per group . Each group undergo image 2 modality ; Group 1 : 99mTcSPECT plus CMR , Group 2 : 99mTcSPECT plus CT , Group 3:99mTcSPECT plus stress echocardiography . All 450 patient undergo standard invasive coronary angiography follow completion non-invasive imaging , except patient nuclear non-nuclear imaging modality reveal normal result confirm absence significant coronary artery disease ( i.e invasive angiography would clinically indicate FFR would consider 0.8 ) . Thrombolysis Myocardial Infraction ( TIMI ) flow measure patient undergo angiography , fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measure patient except TIMI flow =0 , 1 2 . All imaging procedure must complete within 6 week . All patient follow-up visit 6 month enrollment . During 6 month follow-up visit major adverse cardiovascular event collect adjudicated clinical endpoint committee ( CEC ) .</detailed_description>
