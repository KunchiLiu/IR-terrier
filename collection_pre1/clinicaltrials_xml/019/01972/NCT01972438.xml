	<brief_summary>Some eye disease help eye drop make person 's blood . These eye drop call autologous serum eye drop , ASEDs . ASEDs study people graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) affect eye find helpful side effect . The purpose study determine whether ASEDs safe effective control ( normal saline ) help eye symptom people severe chronic eye GVHD . Each participant study blood draw prepare ASEDs specifically participant . Each participant schedule receive ASEDs 3 month placebo eye drop ( salt water ) 3 month . Participants know receive ASEDs receive placebo eye drop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Controlled , Double-Masked , Clinical Trial Autologous Serum Eye Drops Severe Ocular Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease ( GVHD ) Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : A common , serious debilitate long term complication hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HCST ) chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Ocular GVHD develop 85 % patient chronic GVHD . It characterize progressive keratitis sicca cicatrize ocular inflammatory surface disease T cell mediate damage conjunctival corneal epithelium lacrimal tissue . Various medical surgical treatment use , various lubricate agent , steroid drop ointment , cyclosporin drop , punctal plug cautery partial tarsorrhaphy . However , severe case , none offer acceptable , long-lasting relief pain , irritation , dryness diminish vision associate ocular GVHD . An alternative treatment previously safely investigate autologous serum eye drop ( ASEDs ) . The objective study determine whether ASEDs effective control ( normal saline ) treatment severe chronic ocular GVHD HSCT patient unresponsive standard medical treatment . Study Population : Eighteen post-HSCT patient severe ocular GVHD unresponsive standard medical treatment enrol . Initially , 34 post-HSCT patient severe ocular GVHD unresponsive standard medical treatment enrol . However , 18 enrol , investigational product ( IP ) longer provided participant June 2015 due manufacture issue . Design : This Phase 2 , randomize , double-masked , control , crossover , single-center study investigate ASEDs participant severe chronic ocular GVHD . During initial crossover phase study , participant participate two-period , six-month , crossover study participant randomize one two treatment sequence group . The two group : 1 ) daily administration ASEDs first three month crossover control ( normal saline ) eye drop begin Month 3 Month 6 , 2 ) daily administration control ( normal saline ) eye drop first three month crossover ASEDs begin Month 3 Month 6 . Participants group apply assigned drop four time per day six month , well maintain current standard ocular GVHD therapy . Following initial crossover phase , begin Month 6 visit , participant provide ASEDs open-label treatment as-needed basis study completion . As June 2015 , participant inform discontinue use IP send back NIH Pharmacy . During first year , require clinic visit occur Baseline , Months 3 , 6 12 require telephone follow-up visit Months 7 9 . Following Month 12 visit , participant evaluate every six month , alternate telephone follow-up visit clinic visit , last enrol participant reach his/her Month 12 visit . At discretion Investigator , participant complete Month 12 visit recent study visit constitute final safety visit , otherwise participant schedule final safety visit within 4 1/2 month . Participants already surpass Month 12 visit schedule final safety visit within 4 1/2 month . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome proportion participant experience ≥ 50 % reduction combine score modified Oxford punctate keratopathy grade National Institutes Health ( NIH ) /National Eye Institute ( NEI ) visual analogue scale study eye baseline Month 3 . A ≥ 50 % reduction combine score consider treatment success . While design crossover study , primary outcome assess first period Month 3 . Secondary outcome include change combine score modified Oxford punctate keratopathy grade NIH/NEI visual analogue scale eye baseline end period , change chronic ocular GVHD Composite Assessment Scale ( CAS ) score , objective testing , subjective test global chronic GVHD assessment eye . Safety outcomes number severity systemic ocular toxicity adverse event . The number participant withdraw study treatment due vision loss , adverse event treatment failure also contribute assessment safety .</detailed_description>
