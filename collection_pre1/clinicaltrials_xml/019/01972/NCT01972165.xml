	<brief_summary>A study show mini-incision release technique decrease pathologic swell median nerve inlet carpal tunnel increase flatten ratio median nerve carpal tunnel . However , unknown whether endoscopic release technique similarly reverse pathological change median nerve along carpal tunnel patient CTS compare mini-incision release . Investigators therefore conduct current study compare subjective outcome US-measured morphological change median nerve patient CTS receive either mini-incision endoscopic release . Investigators hypothesize ( 1 ) subjective outcome , assess Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) symptom/function score DASH score , would similar 24 week either mini-incision endoscopic carpal tunnel release ; ( 2 ) change morphology median nerve level carpal tunnel , measure high-resolution US , would similar 24 week either mini-incision endoscopic carpal tunnel release ; ( 3 ) morphological change would correlate improvement subjective outcomes 24 week mini-incision endoscopic carpal tunnel release .</brief_summary>
