	<brief_title>Dovitinib ( TKI258 ) Treatment Patients With Relapsed Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite intensive treatment effort combine surgery , radio- chemotherapy , prognosis patient suffer glioblastoma ( GBM ) remain poor . Virtually GBMs progress despite therapy . Patients receive standard therapy primary disease median overall survival 12-15 month . There currently define standard treatment regimen recurrent GBM . Tyrosine kinase receptor-targeted therapy widely use preclinical clinical experimental brain tumor research . Increased tyrosine kinase activity asssociated GBM oncogenesis several tyrosine kinase receptor , e.g . VEGFR , FGFR , PDGFR upregulated malignant glioma . In past present , target VEGF- PDGF-signaling ( amongst others ) show promising preclinical clinical result human glioblasto-ma . In context vitro study lead assumption application multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor could effective treatment approach GBM patient . We able demonstrate GBM cell different tumor region express different set tyrosine kinase receptor could target multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258 , include PDGFRß , CSF 1R , KIT , FLT3 , VEGFR , TrkA , RET FGFRs . In combination ability cross blood-brain-barrier ( BBB ) , exploration TKI258 patient recurrent GBM appear promise . Recently , safety feasibility TKI258 demonstrate adult patient advance solid malignan-cies . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) determine recommend dose phase II trial establish . Meanwhile , TKI258 phase III development renal cell carcinoma , phase II devel-opment advance breast cancer , relapse multiple myeloma urothelial cancer . Since toxicity profile compound could cross BBB might different patient CNS diseases/disorders ( e.g . brain tumor ) compare patient malignancy outside CNS , propose phase I trial explore TKI258 patient recurrent glioblastoma . In study modify 3+3 dose find design , safe tolerable dose TKI258 patient relapse glioblastoma establish .</detailed_description>
