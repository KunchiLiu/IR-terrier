	<brief_title>Pilot Study NanoKnife Ablation Prostate Cancer Low Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design prospective , non-randomized pilot study 6 subject treat three ( 3 ) clinical site . This study involve six ( 6 ) subject meet low risk prostate cancer criterion define protocol . The subject ' prostate cancer focus , location determine ultrasound guide transperineal 3-Dimensional Prostate Mapping Biopsy ( 3D-PMB ) , target treatment NanoKnife System . The primary objective portion study evaluate procedural short-term post treatment safety NanoKnife treatment via incidence adverse event evaluation effect urologic ( urinary erectile ) function . The secondary objective study evaluate short term efficacy NanoKnife treatment . Local efficacy area treatment assess via histological evaluation 3D-PMB core obtain throughout half prostate treatment target three ( 3 ) month post NanoKnife treatment , evaluate ablation zone create NanoKnife treatment . Following 3 month biopsy assessment data 6 subject submit FDA confirmation short term safety efficacy . This group subject continue follow safety efficacy 2 year . Safety assess via incidence adverse event evaluation effect urologic function quality life . Local efficacy characterize via MR image evaluate via post treatment prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) kinetics include time PSA nadir post-nadir PSA stability .</detailed_description>
