	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow criterion order enrol trial : 1 . Be least 12 year age , male female , race ; 2 . Provide write informed consent sign HIPAA form . Subjects age 18 ( yet reach age majority per local regulation ) need sign assent form well parent legal guardian sign inform consent ; 3 . Willingness ability follow instruction comply schedule followup visit , include ability read English complete NEIVFQ 25 questionnaire ; 4 . For female capable become pregnant , agree urine pregnancy test perform Visit 2 prior randomization study eye prior treatment fellow and/or crossover eye ; must lactate , must agree use medically acceptable form birth control least one week prior Visit 2 , one week prior treatment fellow eye crossover eye , continue use method one month follow last treatment . Acceptable form birth control spermicide barrier , oral contraceptive , injectable implantable method contraception , transdermal contraceptive , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization partner . For nonsexually active female , abstinence consider acceptable form birth control . Women consider capable become pregnant include female experience menarche experience menopause ( define amenorrhea great 12 consecutive month ) undergo successful surgical sterilization ( e.g . hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) ; 5 . Subjects &gt; 25 year old time screen study eye must meet following criterion . Subjects ≤ 25 year old subject felloweye crossover eye treat required meet criterion ; Having diagnosis progressive keratoconus define one follow change period 36 month less : 1 . An increase ≥ 1.00 D steep keratometry value ( ksteep ) 2 . An increase ≥ 1.00 D regular astigmatism evaluate subjective manifest refraction evaluate compare eyeglass contact lens prescription current subjective manifest refraction 3 . A myopic shift ( decrease spherical equivalent ) ≥ 0.50 D subjective manifest refraction evaluate compare eyeglass contact lens prescription current subjective manifest refraction 4 . A decrease ≥ 0.1 mm BOZR ( Back Optical Zone Radius ) rigid contact lens wearer information available 6 . Having topographic evidence keratoconus diagnosis mild , moderate , severe keratoconus define follow : Mild Keratoconus : 1 . Axial topography consistent keratoconus 2 . Flat Pentacam keratometry read ≤ 51.00D Moderate Keratoconus : 1 . Axial topography consistent keratoconus 2 . Flat Pentacam keratometry read &gt; 51.00 D ≤ 56.00 D astigmatism ≥ 8.00 D Severe Keratoconus : 1 . Axial topography consistent keratoconus mark area steepen 2 . Flat Pentacam keratometry read &gt; 56.00 D 7 . Presence central inferior steepen Pentacam map ; 8 . Have maximum corneal curvature , measure Kmax , ≥ 47.00 D ; 9 . BSCVA ≥ 1 letter ≤ 80 letter ETDRS chart ; 10 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : Removal contact lenses require 1 week period prior first screen refraction visit ( subsequent Visit 1 , necessary ) must remain 1 month visit complete ; 11 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : Manifest refraction must stable two consecutive visit occur least 7 day apart . A stable refraction one manifest refraction spherical equivalent average K ( Km ) Pentacam take first visit differ 0.75 D respective measurement take second exam . A contact lens wearer define someone worn contact lenses eye treat last 30 day . Subjects must meet follow criterion enrol trial : 1 . Contraindications , sensitivity know allergy use test article ( ) component ; 2 . If female , pregnant , nurse plan pregnancy course study positive urine pregnancy test Visit 2 prior randomization treatment either eye ; 3 . Eyes classify either normal , atypical normal , keratoconus suspect severity grade scheme ; 4 . A history previous corneal surgery insertion Intacs eye treat ; 5 . A history previous Limbal Relaxing Incision ( LRI ) procedure eye treat ; 6 . Corneal pachymetry &lt; 375 micron prior epithelial debridement thin point measure Pentacam eye treat ; 7 . Eyes aphakic ; 8 . Eyes pseudophakic UV block lens implant ; 9 . Previous ocular condition ( refractive error ) eye treat may predispose eye future complication . For example : 1 . History evidence active inactive corneal disease ( e.g. , herpes simplex keratitis , herpes zoster keratitis , corneal melt , recurrent corneal erosion syndrome , corneal dystrophy , etc . ) ; 2 . Clinically significant corneal scar crosslinking treatment zone related keratoconus , investigator 's opinion , interfere crosslinking procedure ; 10 . A history delay epithelial heal eye treat ; 11 . Subjects nystagmus condition would prevent steady gaze treatment diagnostic test ; 12 . Subjects current condition , investigator 's opinion , would interfere prolong epithelial healing ; 13 . Taking supplement contain Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) within 1 week crosslinking treatment ; 14 . A history previous corneal crosslinking treatment eye treat ; 15 . The subject participate investigational drug device study within 30 day screen concurrently enrol another investigational drug device study . 16 . The Investigator may exclude discontinue subject sound medical reason .</criteria>
