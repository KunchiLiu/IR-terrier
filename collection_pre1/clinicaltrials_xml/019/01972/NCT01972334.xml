	<brief_summary>The incidence C. difficile infection ( CDI ) alarmingly increase past several year affect population expand include previously low risk , child . The annual US financial burden associate infection great estimate exceed $ 1.8 billion . C. difficile infection arises gut microbial ecology disrupt intervention notorious perturb delicate microbial balance . A well known common example use antibiotic . Fecal microbiota transplant ( FMT ) introduce several decade ago attempt restore gut microbial balance . To date great number report success eliminate recurrent C. difficile infection restore gut microbial profile resemble healthy donor . While 300 case described literature , pediatric control study perform compare efficacy placebo . Therefore , strong need determine safety efficacy pediatric randomize controlled study . The investigator hypothesize child recurrent C. difficile infection respond fecal transplant therapy modify gut microbial profile . The investigator propose randomize , placebo control , pilot study fecal microbial transplant child recurrent C. difficile infection evaluate safety efficacy fecal microbial transplant child prevent recurrent C. difficile infection . The investigator anticipate fecal microbial transplant child recurrent C. difficile infection safe efficacious provide child great alternative disease difficult treat . Results study establish major role gut microbiome disease demonstrate viability gut microbial transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
