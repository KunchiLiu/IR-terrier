	<brief_summary>To improve rectal cancer management , need good visualization drug target rectal cancer identify patient might benefit specific target treatment . Molecular image rectal cancer associate target promise technique accommodate need . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) , differentially express normal versus malignant colon tissue , proven valid target molecular imaging . Fluorescent label bevacizumab ( VEGF target humanize monoclonal antibody currently use anti-cancer therapy ) use IRDye800CW ( fluorescent dye ) potential advantage view safety , infrastructure , cost , stability image resolution . Therefore , fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW develop University Medical Center Groningen ( UMCG ) recently approve administered patient tracer dose . To detect tracer vivo patient colorectal cancer , newly develop flexible near-infrared ( NIR ) fluorescence endoscope optoacoustic endoscope develop used clinical study . Optical fluorescence imaging may support response evaluation follow chemoradiotherapy give insight patient might benefit anti-VEGF targeted therapy future study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Visualization Rectal Cancer During Endoscopy , Using Fluorescent Tracer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In non-randomized , non-blinded , prospective , single center feasibility study , patient locally advanced rectal cancer include RAPIDO study ( NL36315.042.11 ) undergo two time epi-illumination endoscopy ( word flexible NIR fluorescence endoscopy ) . The study consist total five study procedure relate visit : - Visit 1 : During screen visit , eligibility evaluate patient characteristic collect . - Visit 2 : During second visit 4.5 mg bevacizumab-IRDye800CW administer intravenously . The patient observe 1 hour post administration . - Visit 3 : First endoscopy perform baseline ( two day tracer administration ) ; start chemoradiotherapy . - Visit 4 : After chemoradiotherapy patient receive second dose 4.5 mg bevacizumab-IRDye800CW ( second tracer administration ) - Visit 5 : A second flexible NIR fluorescence endoscopy procedure perform ( two-three day second tracer injection ) , preferably right surgery . Optionally available , ask patient would like undergo optoacoustic endoscopy . This form endoscopic ultrasound able detect bevacizumab-IRDye800CW 2 cm depth . The procedure comparable NIR fluorescence endoscopy . If patient agree , removal NIR fluorescence endoscope optoacoustic endoscope introduce rectum patient detection bevacizumab-IRDye800CW deeper area tumor .</detailed_description>
