	<brief_summary>The Bowel Cancer Screening program implement address important issue prevention early detection bowel cancer . Results first year screen previous small study show current form save many life , continue polyps cancer upper large bowel ( right side ) may difficult detect . There evidence type polyp ( serrated polyp ) may least partly responsible cancer miss initial colonoscopy faster rate growth cancer compare conventional polyp ( adenoma ) . We propose examine participant undergo screen colonoscopy addition contrast dye ( safe food colour agent base already use various bowel camera procedures standard clinical practice ) . This show improve detection conventional polyp significantly even though consider time consume ( possibly take minute longer ) require specific train undertake . We hope study feasibility undertaking procedure improve detection removal polyp within bowel screen program potentially inform study assess impact improve detection consequent potentially reduce incidence interval miss bowel cancer longer term follow . Thus main aim feasibility study ass type procedure would feasible implement acceptable participant , colonoscopists screen program also assess additional time cost involve inform question large study undertaken conclusively prove disprove merit approach term health economics , cancer detection survival .</brief_summary>
