	<brief_summary>Our study compare kidney transplant recipient receive valganciclovir vs. valacyclovir one year follow kidney transplant compare : 1. incidence , magnitude duration CMV EBV viremia first year transplant . 2. side effect anti-viral drug require dose reduction cessation In addition , test renal tissue obtain biopsy post-transplant ( surveillance clinically indicated biopsy ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) fluorescence situ hybridization ass latent CMV and/or EBV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ValGanciclovir Versus ValAcyclovir Viral Prophylaxis Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Herpes viruses Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) cause considerable morbidity mortality post-kidney transplant . Even subclinical CMV and/or EBV viremia associate deterioration kidney transplant function . Currently , valganciclovir ( valG ) primary prophylactic agent CMV kidney transplant recipient CMV viremia note 22 % pediatric post-kidney transplant recipient , incidence University Minnesota ( UMMC ) kidney transplant recipient high 17 % despite valG prophylaxis . CMV disease post-kidney transplant manifest fever , leucopenia , mild severe organ involvement . While effective anti-CMV drug , valG number adverse effect include leucopenia , also side effect mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , one cornerstone current anti-rejection regimen . Combined therapy MMF valG frequently result leucopenia associated infection leucopenia necessitate reduction MMF dose , increase risk rejection . In addition , valG prohibitively expensive force many center adopt pre-emptive therapeutic approach whereby post-Ktx patient screen CMV , new onset viremia , valG initiate . This approach associate increased CMV infection resistant viral strain . Therefore , need alternate , cost-effective drug benign side effect profile equal effectiveness CMV . To date , anti-EBV effect valG poorly define prevention EBV infection close monitoring immunosuppression reduction discovery EBV viremia . EBV present post-kidney transplant infectious mononucleosis syndrome , hepatitis , importantly , initiate potentially fatal lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) . Between October 2003 December 2009 , EBV viremia occur 20 % adult 50 % pediatric kidney transplant recipient ( 60/120 ) UMMC , , PTLD occur 6 % ( 7/120 ) pediatric recipient . Effective anti-EBV prophylaxis could substantially improve kidney transplant outcome . UMMC conduct surveillance biopsy transplant 3 12 month post-kidney transplant adult transplant recipient , provide ideal opportunity ass kidney tissue EBV CMV via molecular immunological assay . Isolating virus infect recipient would pivotal step understand mechanism CMV EBV infection post-kidney transplant . In summary , valacyclovir valganciclovir equivalent efficacy CMV prophylaxis , valacyclovir anticipated effect EBV prevention , use valacyclovir result reduce risk leucopenia-associated infection , low incidence rejection allow use standard MMF dos . Since valacyclovir cheaper , plausible universal prophylaxis plausible affordable option transplant recipient .</detailed_description>
