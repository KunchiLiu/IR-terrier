	<detailed_description>There unmet need improve therapeutic paradigm colorectal cancer , 3rd lead cause cancer 2nd lead cause cancer mortality worldwide . This need underscored population jeopardy , include ~100 million people US 50 1:8 risk associate disease-specific mortality 50 % . Mortality reflect metastatic disease : ~50 % patient initially present regional distant metastasis , ~20 % present occult metastasis . Beyond general population risk , establish stage-specific difference outcome pN0 ( node negative ) African Americans colorectal cancer , exhibit ~40 % excess mortality attributable race . Reductions mortality hamper absence effective chemo- , radio- , immuno- therapeutic approach metastatic disease . In context , immunotherapy disappointing , part , reflect absence antigen tumor-specific , immunogenic , universally associate neoplasia . Moreover , gap survival African Americans Caucasians specifically reflect inability identify occult metastasis increase risk develop recurrent disease . This study advance emerge paradigm colorectal cancer cell detection eradication , employ GCC molecular marker immunological target . GCC protein whose expression normally restrict intestinal epithelial cell , universally express metastatic colorectal tumor . We clinically validate detection occult metastasis lymph node quantify GCC mRNA ( messenger RNA ) reverse transcriptase ( RT ) -PCR ( qRT-PCR ) . This study reveal occult metastasis powerful independent predictor survival pN0 patient . Further , disproportionate burden occult disease African American , compare Caucasian , patient . This new molecular staging platform provide unique opportunity identify occult metastasis underlie racial disparity disease recurrence , could prevent tumor-targeted immunotherapy . In absence ideal tumor antigen , immunotherapy direct tissue-specific protein . Barriers employ self-antigens include tolerance , limit anti-tumor immunity , autoimmunity . The present study advance emerge paradigm exploit immunological compartmentalization mucosally-restricted antigen generate systemic antitumor immunity without autoimmunity . Asymmetry immunological cross-talk compartment , wherein systemic T B cell response rarely extend mucosa , suggest protein normally express mucosa , express systemically tumor , may serve vaccine target metastasis . Advantages cancer mucosa antigens include unique systemic immunoreactivity profile support highly effective durable antitumor immunity context absent immunological cross-talk compartment restrict autoimmunity . Here , paradigm advance employ tumor marker GCC , induce immune response oppose metastatic colorectal cancer preclinical model , without autoimmunity . This study define safety immunological efficacy adenoviral GCC vaccine African American Caucasian pN0 colon cancer patient excess recurrence risk reflect occult lymph node metastasis identify GCC qRT-PCR . This study first step translate GCC vaccine secondary prevention metastasis African American Caucasian colorectal cancer patient .</detailed_description>
