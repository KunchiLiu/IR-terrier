	<brief_summary>Introduction : Despite several expert panel recommendation cellulitis treatment guideline , currently clinical decision rule assist clinician decide emergency department ( ED ) patient treated oral antibiotic patient require intravenous therapy first presentation uncomplicated cellulitis . The objective prospective study determine potential patient risk factor associate adult patient ( &gt; 17years ) present ED concern skin soft tissue infection fail initial antibiotic therapy treatment standard cellulitis require change antibiotic admission hospital . Methods : This study prospective study conduct two tertiary care EDs . Patients exclude treated antibiotic current bout cellulitis prior present ED , patient admit hospital patient abscess . Hired research assistant ( RAs ) administer questionnaire initial ED visit telephone follow-up 2 week later . Treatment failure define patient require subsequent hospitalization , initiation intravenous antibiotic ( oral antibiotic prescribe initially ) , change oral antibiotic original cellulitis . Results : This study provide detailed profile patient risk factor associate treatment failure cellulitis . The result analyze used formulate clinical decision rule effective treatment cellulitis present ED . Each predictor variable associate ( p ≤ 0.1 ) fail treatment univariate analysis consider multivariate logistic regression model . Additionally , treatment variability among clinician regard cellulitis evaluate compare treatment failure , thus provide data successful treatment regimen . Conclusions : Results research may use generate clinical prediction rule assist clinician effectively treat patient present emergency department cellulitis . Understanding patient risk factor treatment failure assist clinician determine patient benefit intravenous versus oral antibiotic .</brief_summary>
