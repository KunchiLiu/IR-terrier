	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call tivozanib possible treatment ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . Angiogenesis formation new blood vessel . Tumors need blood vessel grow spread . Tivozanib anti-angiogenesis medicine fight cancer cut tumor 's blood supply get blood nutrient need grow . In research study , Investigators look see whether tivozanib work maintenance therapy ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma participant achieve complete response follow chemotherapy . Maintenance therapy give disease respond previous treatment . It give help prevent spread recurrence tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Once participant sign consent form , ask undergo screening test procedure find participant research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question participant 's health , current medication , allergy . - Performance status , evaluate participant able carry usual activity . - A tumor assessment CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging . - Blood test . - Urine test . - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study treatment . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . Additional research procedure perform study : - Archival tumor testing : During study , additional test perform sample participant 's original tumor store institution 's tissue bank . These test perform tumor tissue sample previous biopsy surgeries participant 's cancer . The research do sample involve look DNA proteins participant 's cancer see researcher learn participant 's type cancer understand tivozanib might work tumor . Testing sample require participant undergo additional research procedure . This research sample collection require part research study . Tissue collection / Ownership : Participation protocol involve provide specimen ( ) participant 's tissue . Please know investigator leave institution , research tissue might remain DF/HCC might transfer another institution . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : If participant take part research study , participant randomize receive tivozanib mouth therapy . The participant give study drug diary treatment participant randomize tivozanib group . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) . For participant randomize receive tivozanib , participant take study drug per day 3 week follow week rest . The diary also include special instruction take study drug . The study drug take day plenty water .</detailed_description>
