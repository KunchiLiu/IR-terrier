	<brief_title>A Study Compare Oral Absorption ASP1941 Among Two Types Tablets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label randomize two-way crossover study . A single dose two type ASP1941 tablet give non-elderly healthy male subject ( 16 subject group , 32 subject total ) . In case bioequivalence 2 formulation prove study due insufficient number subject , add-on subject study conduct clinical trial need . Same design methodology apply study add-on subject study . The add-on subject study may conduct .</detailed_description>
