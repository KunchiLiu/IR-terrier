	<detailed_description>This 2-part study patient metastatic CRPC . Part A open-label safety run-in study ass safety , tolerability PK olaparib give addition abiraterone 1000 mg daily . Part B randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled comparison efficacy , safety tolerability dose olaparib select Part A give addition abiraterone , versus placebo addition abiraterone . Abiraterone indicate combination prednisone prednisolone treatment patient metastatic CRPC . Prednisone prednisolone 5 mg bid administer abiraterone study , throughout protocol treatment refer simply abiraterone . For Part A study , 15 18 evaluable patient ( Cohorts 1 2 ) plan enrol approximately 4 site approximately 1 2 country , 12 patient may recruit 3rd cohort necessary . For Part B study , approximately 140 patient receive prior chemotherapy contain docetaxel randomise approximately 40 site North America Europe . Patients dose Part A study may participate Part B .</detailed_description>
