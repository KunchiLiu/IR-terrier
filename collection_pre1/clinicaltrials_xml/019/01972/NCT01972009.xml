	<brief_summary>The mechanism govern blood flow heart lungs depend many factor include pump function right ventricle , property artery carry blood right ventricle lung ( pulmonary artery ) , lung . Under normal condition pressure pulmonary artery well control significantly low systemic circulation , however number condition lead abnormally high pressure significant morbidity mortality . However different patient respond differently similarly elevated pressure , lead doctor believe must difference either right ventricle , property artery , lung . It difficult determine relative contribution factor blood flow effect superimpose . One approach use look part circulation ( include systemic circulation coronary artery ) measure simultaneous pressure flow , apply technique call wave intensity analysis ( WIA ) . This technique amongst thing , quantify separate effect wave reflection 'reservoir function ' ( compliance ) artery , systemic circulation WIA increase understanding mechanism behind hypertension physiological change age . The pulmonary artery accept different systemic circulation mechanism behind pulmonary hypertension think different systemic hypertension . This protocol aim determine major influence blood flow pulmonary artery health disease , help understand patient affect others elevate pulmonary pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose Currently best clinical practice investigation pulmonary hypertension ( raise pulmonary pressure ) involve patient attend catheter laboratory catheter pass fluoroscopic guidance via femoral vein measure right heart pressure ( generally also via femoral artery aorta measure leave sided pressure ) . Wave intensity analysis use simultaneous pressure flow measurement give additional information upstream downstream effect haemodynamics , propose lead detail assessment influence cause exacerbate pulmonary hypertension . Until recently possible ass effect formally : standard technique measure local pressure . Design This protocol involve pass catheter per usual practice pulmonary artery aorta . A Combiwire ( standard pressure flow measurement wire available commercially use worldwide past 5 year make physiological measurement coronary artery ) advance approximately 1cm beyond end catheter . Participants usual clinical protocol leave right heart catheterisation ( coronary angiography clinically indicate ) simultaneous pressure flow measurement make addition . Participants also noninvasive imaging ( echocardiography , clinically indicate , cardiac MRI ) serum biochemical measure , per usual clinical practice . They also undergo cardiopulmonary exercise test ass lung cardiac capacity . Recruitment The investigator recruit patient pulmonary hypertension National Pulmonary Hypertension Service await right leave heart catheterisation study part routine diagnostic work . Patients normal pulmonary pressure recruit patient wait list await routine cardiac catheterisation investigation shortness breath chest pain . Recruitment involve discussion patient print material patient refer . They fully aware additional measurement make , therapeutic promise make . Development Research Proposal Interventional cardiologist , pulmonary hypertension specialist , clinical scientist basic scientist involve development protocol . All member involve critique proposal . The investigator also consult patient involve previous research conduct angiography regard number hospital visit additional time required procedure data collection . Consent All patient consent study research Fellow Cardiology SpR ( MBBS , MRCP ) Pulmonary Hypertension Specialist . She able assess capacity understand ethical principle underpin informed consent . Risks , burden benefit The risk use pressure flow wire : The wire advance approximately 1cm outside guide catheter use routine clinical practice . In pulmonary artery wire position approximately 15cm proximal balloon inflate conventional pulmonary capillary wedge pressure measurement . In recently publish study &gt; 7000 patient undergo right heart catheterisation , one incidence pulmonary artery dissection . Damage artery minimise use experienced interventional cardiologist perform procedure . The investigator extensive knowledge making measurement result minimal risk patient . To date patient adverse event secondary use pressure flow wire either pulmonary artery , aorta coronary artery . A pilot safety feasibility study 23 patient undertaken Royal Brompton Hospital normal subject pulmonary hypertension various aetiology show measurement pressure flow use Combiwires pulmonary artery possible patient studied complication . Confidentiality The Caldicott Principles use identifiable data use . In accordance University NHS policy , ensure satisfactory integrity research data confidential patient information , procedural data store anonymised form fully archive hard disk drive , additional backup long term optical storage medium , patient identifiable data store computer locate within NHS facility . Linkage form paper record , retain within NHS premise . If confidentiality need broken seek advice local ethic committee . Conflict Interest We conflict interest . The patient involve study inform via information leaflet result mean end study .</detailed_description>
