	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether self-directed simulation-based lung ultrasound ( LUS ) focus cardiac ultrasound ( FCU ) curriculum efficacious anesthesia trainee ' image acquisition skill diagnostic acumen . The investigator hypothesize self-directed ultrasound-assisted LUS FCU curriculum include video lecture , online teach module , ultrasound simulator , self-directed hands-on session critically ill mechanically ventilated patient effective training novice ultrasonographers obtain good quality image , correctly interpret , support clinical decision-making critically ill patient . Trainees randomize fully supervise FCU hands-on session healthy model critically ill mechanically ventilated patient ( control group - traditional apprenticeship model ) completely self-directed simulation-based approach ( intervention group ) . To assess new self-directed simulation-based ultrasound curriculum lead adequate acquisition competence ( adequate image acquisition interpretation ) novice ultrasonographers , trainee perform focus lung cardiac assessment critically ill mechanically ventilated patient .</brief_summary>
