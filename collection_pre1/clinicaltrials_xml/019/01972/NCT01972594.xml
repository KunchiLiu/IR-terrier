	<brief_summary>Total hip replacement design alleviate pain , reduce disability improve function physical activity level . Whilst pain , disability function often measure follow surgery , actual physical activity . The aim rehabilitation total hip replacement would obtain optimal strength range movement hip along cumulative endurance balance . It take grant , function restore , patient return physical activity level associate good health . In previous study conduct team observe patient , end 3 month hip surgery , reach level physical activity proven beneficial health . Physiotherapy play important role improve function increase level Physical activity total hip replacement patient , limited literature substantiate claim . There need enhance level physical activity patient total hip replacement towards level associate good health . This study aim demonstrate method enhance physical activity level total hip replacement use pedometer base intervention period 3 month . Patients follow customize progressive stepping activity schedule aim establishing level physical activity associate good health . To fully understand recovery pattern subjective objective measure strength hip muscle , range motion hip , overall endurance , balance speed walk patient assess . Questionnaires utilized ass quality life total hip surgery . The physical activity level patient measure physical activity monitor . This study complete Golden Jubilee National Hospital Glasgow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pedometer Based Intervention After Total Hip Replacement-A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity define time spent engage non-sedentary behaviour . This would include sit stand episode , period spend upright period spend step . Physical activity consider purposeful free living activity major health benefit . According World health organisation , Physical activity define bodily movement produce skeletal muscle require energy expenditure . Physical inactivity identify fourth lead risk factor global mortality cause estimate 3.2 million death globally . Improvement Physical activity level direct indirect add-on effect reduce various comorbidities may may exist patient include cardiac disease , stroke , diabetes osteoporosis . These fact also apply orthopedically challenge individual undergo total hip replacement recover . Total hip replacement ( THR ) total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) one common orthopaedic surgery perform termed `` operation century '' . It suggest impairment physical limitation persist long-term follow THR , even absence pain , reduce muscle strength , postural stability flexibility . These factor would indirectly affect physical activity level patient neutralize one purpose total hip replacement . Reduction ability physically active one reason patient undergoes total hip replacement , others pain disability . One goal orthopaedic surgeon bring patient back acceptable level physical function activity , post-surgery . This depend compliance rehabilitation program ability patient . Previously find small increase patient ' actual physical activity post THR surgery , possibly due lifestyle change adopt patient manage condition prior undergoing surgical intervention . Physiotherapy mainstay treatment post-operative total hip replacement attempt address issue impairment , disability function . The use physiotherapy intervention either surgery investigate , evidence suggest benefit outcome . Post-operative physical training include physiotherapy beneficial patient THR , even co-morbidities . It propose early late post-operative protocol include treadmill training , resistance training quadriceps muscle , arm interval exercise training weight bearing exercise eccentric train hip abductor . These protocol appear provide benefit participant , increase strength , endurance balance . However , may applicable clinically current socio economic scenario . There need effective simple protocol implement across range patient group cost effective manner . After undergo require rehabilitation program post major surgery appear gap literature available improvement sustenance physical activity level . If physical activity key component healthy life style promotion monitoring would enhance inform rehabilitation process . The promotion physical activity successful population use pedometer motivational tool . Whilst , intervention implement widely limited evidence specifically population follow orthopaedic surgery . Perhaps recovery 'healthy ' level activity see important objective rehabilitation process simple functional recovery target . 'Participation ' define within World Health Organisation 's International Classification Functioning , Disability Health classification tree concern free-living activity individual . The measurement participation difficult , except questionnaire base approach . To overcome subjective nature questionnaire , body worn monitor develop allow quantification aspect posture step activity . Whilst measurement ability go way towards understand positive benefit hip replacement intervention , knowledge free-living activity would considerably extend clinician/health professional understanding patient 's recovery following operation . Conventional tool assess participation include questionnaire SF36 , WOMAC , UCLA , Hip dysfunction Osteoarthritis Outcome Score , Harris Hip Score Oxford Hip Score . Objective measurement physical activity ( e.g . use body worn monitor ) remove subjectivity questionnaire . There clearly cost time implication use monitoring device , important provide additional , valuable information free-living physical activity comparison quick implement readily accessible questionnaire . Modern pedometer small , user friendly relatively inexpensive ( approximately Â£20 ) , provide suitable tool wide spread use . Pedometers use mean provide motivation enhance physical activity monitoring device quantify activity . The use device within intervention enhance physical activity must base evidence effectiveness . It establish number step achieve day use categorise physical activity level . The 'step define lifestyle index ' categorises individual take le 5000 steps/day sedentary , 5000-7499 steps/ day low active lifestyle 7500 steps/day physically active . Those individual meet 7500+ threshold appear meet moderate vigorous physical activity recommendation health . It also suggest achieve 7000- 8000 step per day Is associate achieve 30 minute per day moderate vigorous physical activity . To gain understanding significance step guideline , establish 3000 accumulated purposeful step per day equate 30 minute moderate physical activity , recommend daily physical activity quotient good health . These recommendation use target , healthy individual also others include orthopedically challenge patient recover surgery . In previous , observational study ( research team follow total hip replacement patient surgery 3 month surgery . Over period relationship physical activity performance aspect ability activity limitation measure laboratory/clinical condition free-living activity record use body worn activity monitor . This observational study reveal number fact recovery process post-surgery : 1 . At 3 month post-surgery , pain generally absent improvement hip strength aerobic endurance . However , patient ' hip strength aerobic endurance , 3 month surgery , observe far reference value age sex match healthy individual . 2 . Patients relatively active undergoing total hip replacement , remain relatively active 3 month follow-up . 3 . The average number step take patient surgery around 5200 step per day surgery 3 month follow-up approximately 5800 step per day . 4 . However , 46 % patient achieve less 5000 step per day 3 month post-surgery . 5 . There direct relationship endurance patient physical activity level achieve patient 3 month follow . 6 . It also note average time spent subject sedentary position , i.e . sit lie , minimally reduce per day pre-surgery 3 month follow-up . Whilst patient recover physical activity level associate good health , large proportion . The need strategy increase physical activity within patient group clear . Previous example successful pedometer base intervention motivate current study aim improve physical activity performance towards level recognise health sustain . The outcome measure use within observational study repeat allow direct comparison study group . The purpose propose study investigate outcome pedometer base intervention improve physical activity level examine could crossover effect change step activity hip strength endurance follow hip replacement surgery . The Chief investigator undergone training Good clinical practice governance experience hospital base research .</detailed_description>
