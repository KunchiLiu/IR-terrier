	<brief_title>MR Guided Dose Escalated RT + Concurrent Chemotherapy Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study investigator want find efficacy give high dos radiation concurrent chemotherapy control unresectable pancreas cancer use either pre-operative post-operative setting . The investigator assess acute late side effect ( problem symptom ) radiation therapy give high dos radiation ( dose escalate ) follow full dose chemotherapy give radiation concurrent chemotherapy pancreas cancer . Radiation therapy give high dos limited proximity normal organ radiation dose distribution improve likelihood control tumor pancreas minimize risk radiation injury organ . There two chemotherapy drug , Capecitabine oral drug take twice per day day radiation therapy give Gemcitabine intravenous drug give per week , radiation therapy . Everyone study already receive chemotherapy alone first . Everyone study receive radiation therapy concurrent chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
