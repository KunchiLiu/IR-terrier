	<brief_summary>Patients intensive care unit ( ICU ) traditionally receive bed rest part care . They develop muscle weakness even day mechanical ventilation may prolong time ICU hospital , delay functional recovery delay return home work . Weakness may avoid simple strategy early exercise ICU . This pilot study aim test hypothesis early mobilisation may improve functional recovery patient group gather pilot data support large randomise trial across Australia New Zealand .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TEAM : A Trial Early Activity Mobility ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admit treated intensive care unit ( ICU ) generally potentially reversible critical illness . While many patient survive , substantial proportion patient fail recover completely return pre-morbid level health . Critically ill patient receive mechanical ventilation , lifesaving intervention , routinely manage deep sedation immobility , result prolong period bed rest . Severe muscle weakness , term ICUAW , common associate prolonged duration mechanical ventilation hospital stay ICU , well poor recovery physical function . Early mobilisation , exercise patient still receive mechanical ventilation , propose candidate intervention prevent ICU acquire weakness ( ICUAW ) . Observational study indicate early mobilisation use routinely critically ill patient Australia New Zealand . TEAM pilot RCT design obtain data assist plan adequately power RCT test hypothesis early mobilisation critically ill patient improve one functional outcome , quality survival , proportion patient survive .</detailed_description>
