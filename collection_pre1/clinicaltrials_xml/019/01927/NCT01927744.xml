	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn add erlotinib standard chemotherapy combination ( docetaxel either cisplatin carboplatin ) help control SCCHN . The safety drug combination also study . In study , erlotinib compare placebo . A placebo drug . It look like study drug design treat disease illness . It design compare study drug learn study drug real effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Chemotherapy With Cisplatin/Carboplatin , Docetaxel With Without Erlotinib Patients With Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas Amenable Surgical Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group ( also know Arm ) : - If Arm A , receive standard chemotherapy combination erlotinib . - If Arm B , receive standard chemotherapy combination placebo . If 1 first 30 patient enrol study , equal chance assign either group . If one next 20 patient enrol study , high chance assign group appear perform well . Up 50 participant assign study group base result see first 50 participant . Neither study doctor know receive erlotinib placebo . However , need safety , study doctor able find receiving . Study Drug Administration : You receive docetaxel either cisplatin carboplatin vein Day 1 3 study cycle , 1-2 hour . The study doctor tell whether receive cisplatin carboplatin . Each study cycle 3 week . You also take tablet either erlotinib placebo every day ( include ) day schedule surgery . You take tablet 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You take tablet empty stomach , least 1 hour 2 hour meal . You take tablet around time day , preferably morning . Your eat habit around time take tablet stay study . lf vomit , actually see tablet , may take another tablet . If , take another tablet next schedule dose . You continue take erlotinib placebo daily day prior surgery ( include day prior surgery ) . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle , receive study drug , describe . Within 7 day Cycles 2 3 : - You physical exam . - You ask current smoking status tobacco use . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At least 14 day last dose chemotherapy : - You physical exam . - You ask current smoking status tobacco use . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You MRI CT scan head neck . If study doctor think need , additional imaging scan may perform . - You complete questionnaire feel different aspect daily life . It take 15 minute complete questionnaire . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . At point study , become pregnant doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Surgery : After stop taking study drug/placebo , surgery already schedule receive . You sign separate consent form describe surgery risk . As part study , tumor tissue collect surgery checked status disease well spread disease . Length Study : You may receive standard chemotherapy combination 3 cycle . You may take study drug/placebo day surgery . If side effect chemotherapy , possible may stop take chemotherapy combination continue receive study drug/placebo surgery . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your active participation study end-of-treatment visit . End Treatment Visit : About 8 week surgery , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) draw biomarker PK testing . - You complete questionnaire daily life . - If become pregnant doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Long Term Follow Up : After end treatment visit , call least 1 time year check . You ( family member designees ) may contact telephone , write , e-mail , clinic visit . It important keep contact information date study staff . This information may also collect check medical record . This investigational study . Erlotinib approve FDA treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Its use study experimental . Docetaxel , cisplatin , carboplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment SCCHN . Up 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
