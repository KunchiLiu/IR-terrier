	<brief_summary>In woman regular menstrual cycle , antral follicle show grow synchronous cohort , call wave , 2-3 time menstrual cycle . It unknown whether wave follicle growth also occur woman amenorrhea abnormal/absent follicle growth . Further , oligo- amenorrhea associate metabolic disturbance , over- under-nutrition , central obesity insulin resistance . Yet , mechanism whereby metabolic factor influence folliculogenesis woman poorly understood . To understand potential mechanism , investigator plan characterize follicle growth dynamic woman without regular menstrual cycle identify key metabolic difference woman may important normal follicle development fertility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound Characterization Ovarian Follicle Dynamics Women With Amenorrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In ovary , egg rest fluid fill sac call follicle . When follicle grow form small fluid-filled cyst easily see use ultrasound view ovary . In woman regular menstrual cycle , group 10 20 follicle grow regress 2 3 different time cycle ( usually 28- day period ) . Several follicle grow stage begin develop potential ovulate - general one follicle choose ovulate . Thus , give time menstrual cycle , numerous fluid-filled follicle visualize woman 's ovary various stage development use transvaginal ultrasonography . In woman absent infrequent menstrual cycle , little known growth pattern follicles factor metabolic hormone , might play role failure ovulate . Being underweight overweight increase chance irregular absent menstrual cycle history abnormal reproductive function compound woman 's risk chronic disease infertility , diabetes , hypertension , atherosclerosis certain cancer . This particularly case woman polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) menstrual cycle appear worsen improve depend body weight metabolic status . PCOS endocrine disorder affect 6-12 % reproductive-aged woman within general population . The hallmark feature PCOS menstrual irregularity , increased level androgen , polycystic ovary . The current diagnostic criterion require 2 3 feature present diagnosis , therefore number phenotype PCOS exist . However , metabolic reproductive difference across phenotypic spectrum PCOS well understood . Women PCOS characteristically polycystic ovary , 10 time follicles present ovary give time . Further , follicle-size population overall distribution throughout ovary varies woman - follicle may situate around periphery ovary may distribute throughout ovary . Presumably small follicle arrest development - emerge data Lujan laboratory suggest case . It assume ovulation occur follicle grow normal wave pattern . In truth , study ever look see whether follicle actually grow , regress arrest woman irregular/absent menstrual cycle . By compare follicle wave dynamic , reproductive hormone marker metabolism woman regular irregular menstrual cycle , researcher plan identify factor might explain fertility potential long-term health compromise woman others . Further , determine metabolic factor unique PCOS represent specific metabolic risk follicle growth impairment . The ultimate goal research understand body composition , nutrition metabolism regulate follicle development woman well develop lifestyle drug therapy help woman preserve fertility long-term health . Since obesity recently become leading cause infertility North America , study especially important . To accomplish objective , investigator plan recruit 30 woman regular menstrual cycle 30 woman self-reported irregular menstrual cycle ( without diagnosis PCOS ) . Our goal recruit equal number woman group match age ( 18 - 38 year old ) body mass index ( BMI ; Normal weight = 18 - 24 kg/m2 ; Overweight = 25 - 29 kg/m2 ; Obese = 30kg/m2 ) . Women undergo serial ultrasonographic ovary every day ovulation ovulation woman regular menstrual cycle 5 week woman cycle irregularity . Blood sample collect visit . Ultrasound scans ovary assess total number , size , distribution follicle use two- three-dimensional imaging technique . Blood sample collect assayed determine serum concentration luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , estradiol , progesterone , anti-müllerian hormone ( AMH ) , inhibin B . During day 3-5 woman regular menstrual cycle time dominant follicle corpus luteum present , early morning visit conduct ass follow metabolic parameter : ( 1 ) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test characterize glucose insulin dynamic 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute post-glucose ingestion ; ( 2 ) dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan quantify body fat lean muscle distribution ; ( 3 ) vitals anthropometry assessment measure waist hip circumference , height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , ( 4 ) fast blood test detect serum concentration androgen ( i.e. , total testosterone , androstenedione , free androgen index ) serum marker metabolic syndrome ( i.e. , lipid hemoglobin A1C ) .</detailed_description>
