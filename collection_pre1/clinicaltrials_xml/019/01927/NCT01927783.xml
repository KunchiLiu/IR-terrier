	<brief_title>Heart Health Study Washington D.C. Develop Community-Based Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity lead increase risk cardiovascular risk factor death cardiovascular disease . Therefore , intervention slow reverse obesity epidemic essential . Community-based intervention reach risk obesity obesity-related cardiovascular risk factor . Interventions base community-based participatory research ( CBPR ) principles develop collaboration community partner , allow intervention component tailor unique need community member . To remain consistent CBPR principle , community assessment necessary understand need target population . Therefore , propose cardiovascular health screen need assessment sample population predominantly African-American church Wards 5 , 7 , 8 . These ward Washington D.C. obesity prevalence high resource physical activity healthy nutrition limit . The screen involve measure cardiovascular health factor body mass index ( BMI ) , physical activity , dietary intake , total cholesterol , blood pressure , fast plasma glucose , cigarette smoking . Based American Heart Association-established goal , cardiovascular health factor define ideal , intermediate , poor , depend control risk factor lifestyle behavior . In protocol , determine prevalence ideal , intermediate , poor cardiovascular health factor within church-based population . We hypothesize percentage church-based population meet ideal criterion cardiovascular health factor low percentage meeting intermediate poor criterion cardiovascular health factor . In addition , evaluate use handheld technology objectively measure physical activity use web-based technology monitor cardiovascular health factor within population . We also evaluate social determinant health , particularly psychosocial environmental factor might hinder weight loss . Finally , establish community advisory board consult plan implementation assessment , interpretation dissemination study finding . The result community-based , cardiovascular health need assessment inform design implementation future community-based behavioral weight loss intervention .</detailed_description>
