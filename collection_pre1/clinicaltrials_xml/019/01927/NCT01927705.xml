	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy FURESTEM-AD Inj . Patients With Moderately Subacute Chronic Atopic Dermatitis ( AD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic dermatitis recur chronic Allergic eczema accompany serious itch xeroderma . Atopic dermatitis special feature increase acidophil , high expression ratio IgE blood . Recently , Atopic dermatitis estimate develop 10 20 percent population world . However , distinguish treatment completely recover . Especially , diagnosis make patient young 5 year old . Moreover , 50 percent get diagnose Atopic dermatitis 6 month 24 month . According National epidemiological investigation conduct Korean Academy Pediatric Allergy Respiratory Disease , Outbreak ratio Atopic dermatitis continually increase past decade . Accordingly , become major social concern . It really important patient care diagnose soon find symptoms Atopic dermatitis . The reason 50 75 percent Atopic dermatitis patient suffer Allergies cause asthma rhinitis . Recently , It report Mesenchymal stem cell special ability restrict growth lymphocyte non-specific restrict activation lymphocyte stimulus mitogen antigen . It also report restrict lymphocyte Mesenchymal stem cell need HLA-matching unlike case T-cell . It find Mesenchymal stem cell ' ability autoimmune induction weak low expression antigen like HLA-DR . It also discover Mesenchymal stem cell cause autoimmune side-effect even though inject body . When body get infected pathogen , innate immune response operate primary defence mechanism . time , receptor react first TLR ( toll-like receptor ) NLR ( nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain ) locate cytoplasm cell . It report activity TLR express Mesenchymal stem cell play important role immunomodulatory ability Mesenchymal stem cell . Furthermore , human Umbilical Cord Blood derived-Universal Stem Cells ( hUCB-USCs ) manifest TLR NLR Mesenchymal Stem cell time . receptor become activation , maximize ability immunomodulatory . Therefore , hUCB-USCs utilized cure intractable autoimmune disease like Atopic dermatitis . Further , It huge possibility cell therapy product autoimmune disease .</detailed_description>
