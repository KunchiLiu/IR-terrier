	<brief_summary>The investigator would like determine aspect metabolism age influence ovarian function . The purpose study understand nutrition metabolism relate follicle development woman regular cycle , irregular cycle , polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . We also plan identify lifestyle factor associate PCOS understand diet activity level impact feature PCOS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutritional Metabolic Correlates Ovarian Morphology Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In ovary , egg rest fluid fill sac call follicle . When follicle grow form small fluid-filled cyst easily see use ultrasound view ovary . In woman regular menstrual cycle , group follicle grow regress 2 3 time cycle ( usually 28- day period ) . Several follicle grow stage begin develop potential ovulate - general one follicle choose ovulate . Thus , give time menstrual cycle , numerous fluid-filled follicle visualize woman 's ovary various stage development use transvaginal ultrasonography . In woman absent infrequent menstrual cycle , little known growth pattern follicles factor metabolic hormone , might play role failure ovulate . Being underweight overweight increase chance irregular absent menstrual cycle history abnormal reproductive function compound risk chronic disease infertility , diabetes , hypertension , atherosclerosis certain cancer . This particularly case woman PCOS menstrual cycle appear worsen improve depend body weight metabolic status . Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) endocrine disorder affect 6-12 % reproductive-aged woman within general population . The hallmark feature PCOS menstrual irregularity , increased level androgen , polycystic ovary . The current diagnostic criterion require 2 3 feature present diagnosis , therefore number phenotype PCOS exist . However , metabolic reproductive difference across phenotypic spectrum PCOS well understood . Women PCOS characteristically polycystic ovary , 10 time follicles present ovary give time . Further , follicle-size population overall distribution throughout ovary varies woman - follicle may situate around periphery ovary may distribute throughout ovary . Presumably small follicle arrest development - emerge data Lujan laboratory suggest case . Rather , follicle continue grow dynamic pattern prolong period anovulation . By compare follicle population , reproductive hormone marker metabolism woman regular cycle , woman irregular cycle , woman history PCOS , researcher plan identify factor might explain fertility potential long-term health compromise woman others . By include woman early late stage reproductive potential , researcher also able assess influence age factor . The ultimate goal research understand nutrition metabolism regulate follicle development woman well develop lifestyle drug therapy help woman preserve fertility long-term health . Since obesity recently become leading cause infertility North America , study especially important . Current research fail thoroughly examine relationship dietary intake , energy expenditure PCOS . The purpose propose study identify lifestyle factor associate PCOS . Through dietary intake energy expenditure data , researcher plan examine potential lifestyle difference PCOS healthy woman , well BMI classification within woman PCOS . The Research Team also able evaluate diet quality accord USDA Dietary Guidelines Americans woman include study . The Research Team also interest relationship biological marker lifestyle endpoint woman without PCOS . Previous literature show biological marker difference without PCOS . By examine relationship , researcher may understand whether PCOS status associate lifestyle parameter . To accomplish objective , investigator plan recruit 150 woman regular menstrual cycle 150 woman irregular menstrual cycle , without PCOS ( sub-grouped 75 woman irregular menstrual cycle 75 woman history PCOS ) . Their goal recruit equal number woman group match age ( 18 - 48 year old ) body mass index ( BMI ; Normal weight = 18 - 24 kg/m2 ; Overweight = 25 - 29 kg/m2 ; Obese = 30kg/m2 ) . Women include PCOS sub-group confirm PCOS diagnosis primary care provider . Ultrasound scans ovary assess total number , size , distribution follicle use two- three-dimensional imaging technique . Participants blood sample collect determine serum concentration luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , estradiol , progesterone , anti-müllerian hormone ( AMH ) , inhibin B . The following metabolic parameter assess : ( 1 ) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test characterize glucose insulin dynamic 0 , 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 minute post-glucose ingestion ; ( 2 ) dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan quantify body fat lean muscle distribution ; ( 3 ) vitals anthropometry assessment measure waist hip circumference , height , weight , blood pressure , heart rate , ( 4 ) fast blood test detect serum concentration androgen ( i.e. , total testosterone , androstenedione , free androgen index ) serum marker metabolic syndrome ( i.e. , lipid hemoglobin A1C ) . Participants complete food frequency questionnaire physical activity questionnaire . A researcher may also provide participant accelerometer wear week .</detailed_description>
