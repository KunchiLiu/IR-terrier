	<criteria>These criterion meet Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) , Washout Visit ( Visit 2 ) , Baseline Visit ( Visit 3 ) , reassess . An understanding , ability , willingness fully comply study procedure restriction . Ability voluntarily provide write , sign , date ( personally via legally authorize representative ) inform consent applicable participate study complete studyrelated procedure . Subjects 18 year age old time sign consent . Female subject one following : 1 . Postmenopausal ( 12 consecutive month spontaneous amenorrhea ) 2 . Surgically sterile , 3 . Females childbearing potential must negative serum BetaHCG pregnancy test Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) negative urine pregnancy test Baseline Visit ( Visit 3 ) . Females childbearing potential must agree abstain sexual activity could result pregnancy agree use acceptable method contraception . Subjects betathalassemia receive least 100mL/kg packed red blood cell ( &gt; 20 transfusion unit ) iron overload ( transfusional hemosiderosis ) require chronic treatment iron chelator . Serum ferritin &gt; 500µg/L Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Baseline LIC ( last MRI assessment prior Day 1 ) great equal 2.0mg less 30.0mg iron per g ( equivalent dry weight , liver ) determine FerriScan® R2 MRI . 8 . Mean previous 3 pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration great equal 7.5g/dL assess Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) ( 1 value clinical laboratory test take Screening Visit [ Visit 1 ] previous 2 historical value available ) . Severe iron overload include : ( ) cardiac T2* MRI le 10.0ms ; ( b ) LIC FerriScan® R2 MRI great equal 30.0mg/g liver ( dw ) assess Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Iron overload cause transfusional siderosis . Subjects thalassemia intermedia Unable undergo MRI assessment . Cardiac LVEF le 50 % baseline test MRI . Subjects document liver failure ( presence portal hypertension , hepatic edema , ascites , cirrhosis ) , ChildPugh C hepatic impairment , biliary disorder . Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Absolute neutrophils count &lt; 1500mm3 Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Evidence renal insufficiency eg , creatinine clearance &lt; 60mL/min serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x ULN Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Clinically significant laboratory assessment Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Significant proteinuria : urinary protein/creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 nonfirst void urine sample Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) . Current recurrent disease could affect action , absorption , disposition investigational product , clinical laboratory assessment . Current relevant history physical psychiatric illness , medical disorder may require treatment make subject unlikely fully complete study , condition , include pregnancy , present undue risk investigational product procedure . Current use medication contraindicate deferasirox prescribing information/SmPC . Known suspected intolerance hypersensitivity SSP004184AQ , deferasirox , closelyrelated compound , state ingredient either medication . Known history alcohol substance abuse within last year . Within 30 day prior Baseline Visit ( Visit 3 ) : 1 . Have use investigational product 2 . Have enrol clinical study ( include vaccine study ) , investigator 's opinion , may impact study . History malignancy within past 5 year , exception basal cell squamous cell skin carcinoma cervical carcinoma situ completely resect colon carcinoma situ . Insufficient venous access precludes prescribe blood draw safety laboratory assessment . Pregnant lactating female .</criteria>
