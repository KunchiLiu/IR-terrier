	<brief_summary>Background - Esophageal carcinoma sixth lead cause cancer -related mortality eighth common cancer worldwide - The incidence increase rapidly - The overall 5-year survival range 15 % 25 % literature poor outcomes related diagnosis advance stage . - Surgery use cornerstone treatment resectable esophageal cancer , treatment esophageal carcinoma remain challenge need consider multimodal approach . However modality impact multimodal approach national level unknown Primary objective : To identify predictor recurrence esophageal cancer surgery Secondary objective : - 5-year recurrence free survival - 5-year overall survival - Predictors postoperative mortality morbidity surgery - Impact pCR recurrence survival - Impact neoadjuvant treatment recurrence survival - Impact patient preconditioning ( nutritional support , esophageal prosthesis , mini-invasive approachâ€¦ ) outcomes Methodology : European French-speaking retrospective multicentric study Inclusion criterion : All consecutive patient operate , histologically proven carcinoma esophagus , oesophago-gastric junction ( Siewert type I II ) , surgical investigator center January 2000 December 2010 Exclusion criterion : Siewert III type carcinoma oesophago-gastric junction , non surgical treatment esophageal carcinoma Planned study period : The data collect 11-year period January 2000 December 2010 . Follow ascertain May 2013 .</brief_summary>
