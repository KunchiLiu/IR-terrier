	<brief_title>Assessment Neurologic Injury Subsequent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nearly 1 10 adult 65 year aortic valve stenosis ( AS ) , define obstruction blood flow across aortic valve . ( Faggiano , Antonini-Canterin et al . 2006 ) AS life-threatening disease , one whose incidence increase age . Natural history study suggest long-term survival among patient severe AS unfavorable , even among patient asymptomatic , event-free survival AS 64 % 1-year , 36 % 2-years , 12 % 4-years , 3 % 6-years . ( Rosenhek , Zilberszac et al . 2010 ) Until recently surgery gold standard approach treatment severe AS . Recently , less invasive approach , transcathether aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) emerge viable treatment alternative , include among previously think suitable candidate surgery . Unlike surgical counterpart utilize cardiopulmonary bypass direct vision cardiothoracic surgeon , TAVR perform ( surgeon conjunction interventional cardiologist ) thread wire mesh valve catheter use fluoroscopy heart still beat . Concern regard broad adoption TAVR often revolve around high stroke rate relative surgery ( 5.5 % vs. 2.4 % , p = 0.04 ) . ( Leon , Smith et al . 2010 ) Much risk associate neurologic injury ( whether stroke , neurocognitive deficit silent infarct ) revolve around embolically-generated source , include : threading guidewire across diseased vessel , removal native valve , insertion/expansion new valve . ( Miller , Blackstone et al . 2012 ) Among 47 patient study Miller within neurologic sub-study PARTNER Trial , 49 ( n=31 TAVR , 16 AVR ) neurologic event ( define transient ischemic attack stroke ) . ( Miller , Blackstone et al . 2012 ) In recent review article , Daneault cite risk post-procedural cerebral infarct within 5-7 day ( use Diffusion-weighted MRI ) 38-47 % standard aortic valve surgery vs. 68-84 % TAVR . ( Daneault , Kirtane et al . 2011 ) Given grow interest anticipate broaden indication TAVR outside United States , increasingly important develop sound methodological approach evaluate safety effectiveness emerge treatment modality . In absence information , impossible patient clinician estimate likelihood develop neurologic injury subsequent TAVR . Additionally , linkage process care embolism detection ( transcranial Doppler ) would provide evidence support target quality improvement effort . Such strategy useful prior study apply coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery . ( Groom , Quinn et al . 2009 ) Indeed , early study evaluate TAVR find period TAVR procedure may prone generation embolic debris , although use varied methodological approach . Importantly , relationship embolus development neurobehavioral ischemic lesion explore set . The overlap sleep disorder stroke emerge field . Sleep apnea serious medical condition common stroke , affect half acute ischemic stroke patient . ( Broadley , Jorgensen et al . 2007 ) Recently , sleep apnea recognize independent risk factor stroke . ( Munoz , Martinez-Vila et al . 2006 ; Redline , Gottlieb et al . 2010 ; Yaggi , Kernan et al . 2005 ) Furthermore , sleep apnea identify important predictor poor functional outcome death follow stroke . ( Sahlin , Sandberg et al . 2008 ; Turkington , Allgar et al . 2004 ) There remain controversy whether OSA predate stroke , whether stroke predates sleep apnea , whether stroke exacerbates sleep apnea severity . To answer question definitely , sleep apnea test would perform prior stroke . Because stroke typically unpredictable , logistically challenge pursue . The current study however provide rare opportunity study patient sleep-disordered breathe prior type procedure association acute cerebral infarction identify MRI . ( Kalert , Knipp et al . 2010 ) Within context , seek determine feasibility assess neurologic injury subsequent TAVR . Such model apply previously principal investigator ass improve neurologic outcome cardiac surgical procedure . ( Groom , Quinn et al . 2009 ) We shall assess patient follow interval : pre-procedure , within 72-96 hour post-procedure , 3 month post-procedure ( see Appendix ) . Case video establish assist identify associate embolus ( use transcranial Doppler ) process clinical care TAVR procedure . Neurologic injury assess follow way : stroke ( neurologic exam , NIH Stroke Scale ) , silent infarct ( diffusion-weighted MRI , diffusion-tensor imaging ) , neurobehavioral deficit ( battery neuropsychological test ) . Secondly , investigate change apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , measure sleep-disordered breathing , v surgery subject develop post-operative acute brain infarction . We hypothesize subject develop acute brain infarction increase AHI baseline post-op measurement compare subject develop acute brain infarction .
