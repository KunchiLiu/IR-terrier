	<brief_summary>The main objective study assess efficacy antioxidant prevent pigmentation induce visible light subject phototype IV V. Patients expose range visible light area back confirm study eligibility . Patients show pigmentation 7 day expose area eligible continue . Eligible patient study product apply part back placebo another part back . The placebo area expose range light base Day -7 . The area antioxidant apply high range light exposure area without study product . Seven day later , area examine determine low exposure induce pigmentation side placebo antioxidant . The color also measure two identical exposure placebo antioxidant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At Day -7 , subject expose pre-specified range dose visible light 6 area back , measure 0.9 cm^2 order evaluate pigmentary response visible light . The dos 20 , 40 , 80 , 160 , 320 640 J/cm^2 . At Day 0 , visual inspection establish subject qualify remainder study , base presence absence pigmentation induce visible light . Subjects exhibit pigmentation 640 J/cm^2 low pursue study . Subjects demonstrate pigmentation move next step study . On Day 0 visit , subject randomize receive topical antioxidant preparation one two half back control side . The antioxidant control apply twice exposure visible light do Day 1 : 24 hour prior ( Day 0 ) 30 minute prior ( Day 1 ) exposure . On Day 1 , skin antioxidant expose fluences 80 , 160 , 320 , 640 , 1280 1920 J/cm^2 whereas control expose low dos Day -7 . This do total 12 different area 0.9 cm^2 , six side antioxidant preparation , six side control . On Day 7±1 , visual assessment do exposed area , well quantitative colorimetric measurement research photograph . The visual assessment consist determination low fluence induce visible pigmentation half back ( antioxidant control ) . The colorimetric measurement do area expose 320 640 J/cm^2 compare pigmentation present skin antioxidant apply skin control apply . The colorimetric assessment adjacent unexposed skin also perform . At Day 0 , 1 7 visit , subject also evaluate adverse event .</detailed_description>
