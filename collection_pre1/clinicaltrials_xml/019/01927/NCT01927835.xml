	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Two HIV Vaccine Regimens Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults United States South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response two different vaccine schedule prime either DNA HIV vaccine ( DNA-HIV-PT123 ) , NYVAC HIV vaccine ( NYVAC-HIV-PT1 NYVAC-HIV-PT4 ) follow boost combination NYVAC HIV vaccine ( PT1 &amp; PT4 ) AIDSVAX B/E . Study researcher also evaluate whether body mass index ( BMI ) and/or sex impact immunogenicity vaccine regimens participant South Africa , look regional difference immunologic response United States South African participant . The study enroll 264 healthy , HIV-uninfected people , age 18-50 , United States South Africa . Participants randomly assign one three group receive either one vaccine regimens placebo . Participants receive injection accord assign group schedule study entry ( Month 0 ) Months 1 , 3 , 6 . Participants remain clinic 30 minute receive vaccine observation monitoring . For 7 day receive vaccine , participant record symptom report study researcher . Study visit occur study entry , Months 1 , 1.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 6 , 6.5 , 9 , 12 . All study visit include physical examination , HIV risk reduction counseling , interview and/or questionnaire . Select study visit include urine collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood collection , pregnancy test female participant , HIV test . At visit , participant may also provide sample cervical fluid , rectal fluid , and/or semen . Study researcher contact participant telephone e-mail year 3 year follow first vaccination follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
