	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see specific kind MRI identify small otherwise undetected abnormal lymph node patient thyroid cancer undergo surgery . The MRI call Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( USPIO MRI ) , use experimental contrast agent ( ferumoxytol ) , try identify lymph node . The MRI use magnetic wave take image ( picture ) body commonly use medical testing . Ferumoxytol FDA approve iron replacement product treatment iron deficiency anemia adult patient chronic kidney disease . In research study , investigator want see Ferumoxytol help identify small metastasis usually see standard MRI scan . If use USPIO MRI experimental agent ferumoxytol identifies small metastasis lymph node , surgeon may decide remove . After surgery , node store analyzed ass ability USPIO MRI ferumoxytol detect cancer small metastasis lymph node .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-Operative Nodal Staging Thyroid Cancer Using Ultra-Small Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( USPIO MRI ) : Preliminary Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In research study participant study MRI ( USPIO MRI ) he/she undergoes surgery . Radiologists ( doctor train read understand test ) review study MRI . The image result compare pathology report tissue remove surgery . Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedure find participant research study . These test procedure do part regular care would do even turn participant take part research study . - An tumor assessment CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan thyroid US ( ultrasonography ) scan . - If test show participant eligible participate research study , begin study . If participant meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . - Because woman pregnant nursing baby research study , participant urine pregnancy test woman child bear potential . The participant research study pregnant breastfeeding . - The investigator also ask participant allergic iron . Because study agent contain iron , participant research study allergy . After screen procedure confirm Participant eligible participate research study : The participant one research MRI scan : On first day , participant receive contrast agent intravenously . This visit take 30 minute . Before inject contrast medium , investigator clean skin participant 's forearm alcohol . Then investigator insert small plastic tube ( IV ) vein participant 's forearm . The investigator give participant study agent , ferumoxytol , IV line . The dose ferumoxytol rate administration dose FDA approve people anemia use iron replacement therapy . Before , 30 minute participant get ferumoxytol , investigator monitor ( watch ) participant closely reactions infusion . The participant return Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston MA 02114 , 48-72 hour post contrast MRI . The participant receive Ferumoxytol MRI . This study visit take 45 minute . The participant lie pad table . The table move scanning machine . The space scan machine narrow , bit wider participant 's body . The participant need lie quietly 30 minute image take . If participant problem claustrophobia ( fear discomfort small confine space ) , let study doctor member staff know enrol study . During MRI procedure , participant hear loud `` banging '' noise . This sound powerful magnet make test . The participant give earplug help reduce noise . The participant also able talk MRI technologist test technologist able talk participant . If , test , participant feel uncomfortable continue , let technologist know , test stop immediately . If participant 's MRIs show unusual result might important health , study doctor contact participant 's primary surgeon . The participant 's MRIs review radiologist . They read interpret result communicate participant 's surgeon schedule surgery . The MRI scan may show abnormal signal lymph node outside area surgeon normally remove surgeon may decide extend surgery include additional area . During scheduled surgery , participant 's surgeon remove participant 's thyroid lymph node s/he believe involve . The surgery perform within 30 day MRIs . The image result compare tissue remove surgery . The thyroid involve lymph node surgically remove evaluated pathologist store future assessment case thyroid cancer recur body . This allow investigator compare kind tumor remove time first surgery tumor recur .</detailed_description>
