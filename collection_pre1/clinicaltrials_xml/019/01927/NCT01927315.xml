	<detailed_description>Long-standing diabetes often complicate retinopathy . The mechanisms induce development diabetic retinopathy incompletely understood include alteration bone marrow derive vasculogenic cell call `` endothelial progenitor cell '' . Fenofibrate PPAR-alpha agonist use treatment mixed dislipidemia hypertriglyceridemia . In addition lower triglyceride-rich lipoprotein , PPAR-alpha agonism fenofibrate several additional molecular benefit vessel wall , reduction inflammation . In trial conduct type 2 diabetic patient , drug fenofibrate reduce retinopathy-related endpoint suggest direct effect drug mechanism drive development complication . Preliminary data effect fenofibrate culture EPC show drug potential improve EPC , consequently , may benefit patient retinopathy . Herein , investigator hypothesize fenofibrate treatment increase circulate EPC level diabetic patient retinopathy , compare placebo .</detailed_description>
