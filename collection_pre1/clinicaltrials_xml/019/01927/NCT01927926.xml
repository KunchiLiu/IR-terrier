	<brief_summary>Developing functional food enhance satiety may beneficial individual help manage body weight . We previously show consume mid-morning liquid preload increase proportion energy derive whey protein addition polydextrose reduce voluntary energy intake lunchtime meal compare liquid preload energy content low protein contain polydextrose . This study aim investigate result replicate preload form snack bar . We also investigate whether daily consumption snack bar effect energy intake , subjective appetite metabolic parameter compare control snack energy minimal protein content without addition polydextrose . We hypothesize whey protein polydextrose snack reduce voluntary energy intake subsequent test meal , suppress subjective appetite rating compare control snack bar .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Consuming Whey Protein Polydextrose Snacks Appetite Energy Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Developing functional food product enhance satiety , suppress appetite , reduce subsequent voluntary food intake great extent similar energy match food product , may useful help consumer adhere energy restrict diet optimize successful body weight management . A range food food constituent report potential produce short term change appetite energy intake . However , effect consume food contain ingredient appetite , energy intake long term unclear . We previously show consume mid-morning liquid preload increase proportion energy derive whey protein addition polydextrose reduce voluntary energy intake lunchtime meal compare liquid preload energy content low protein contain polydextrose . Aims : This study aim investigate previous finding replicate use solid snack bar contain whey protein polydextrose . We also investigate whether daily consumption snack bar effect energy intake , subjective appetite metabolic endocrine response . Methods : Using double blind , randomize cross-over design , 10 healthy lean male subject consume whey protein-polydextrose bar iso-energetic control bar mid-morning , between-meal snack 14 consecutive day . The two intervention phase separate 2-wk washout period . On first ( day 1 ) last day ( day 15 ) intervention phase , subjective appetite , voluntary food intake , blood metabolite endocrine responses snack assess laboratory condition . Additionally , participant ask record free-living food intake day 4 , 8 12 intervention .</detailed_description>
