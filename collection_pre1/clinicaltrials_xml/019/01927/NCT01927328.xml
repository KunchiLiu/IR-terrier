	<brief_summary>40 eligible patient confirm esophageal gastric adenocarcinoma anemia randomize control intervention group management anemia . The control group treatment consist standard treatment govern clinical team ( eg oral iron , blood transfusion ) whilst intervention group treat intravenous iron III isomaltoside ( Monofer Â® ) . It hypothesize intravenous iron supplementation efficacious standard therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anemia common problem affect patient diagnose esophageal gastric cancer . This anemia think secondary blood loss tumor , poor oral intake result symptom tumor , impaired iron absorption secondary neoplasia induce inflammatory process . Patients undergo palliative chemotherapy esophageal gastric adenocarcinoma thus prone development exacerbation anemia chemotherapy , tumor remain situ . Anemia result symptoms shortness breath , fatigue , lethargy chest pain , affect quality life . Oral iron blood transfusion current mainstay treatment condition , yet disadvantage . Oral iron often poorly tolerate due side effect include constipation , diarrhea , abdominal pain nausea . Blood transfusion also administer expose patient risk include infection transfusion associate reaction . In order overcome issue , intravenous iron preparation develop improved safety . This single-center , randomize , open label , clinical trial , look investigate efficacy intravenous iron treatment anemia patient diagnosis esophageal gastric adenocarcinoma . Patients randomize receive intravenous iron III isomaltoside ( treatment group ) standard therapy decide clinical team ( control ) . The outcome review include amount frequency blood transfusion receive , change patient blood profile importantly , patient quality life score . Patients follow start chemotherapy begin third cycle . The primary hypothesis test intravenous iron increase quality life reduce symptom anemia . We also hypothesize decrease blood transfusion rate group improve change hemoglobin hematinic . This design pilot study determine feasibility large trial . Randomization perform use random allocation opaque envelope . All data confidentially record , drug reaction side effect .</detailed_description>
