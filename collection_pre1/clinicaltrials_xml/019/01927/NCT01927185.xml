	<brief_summary>Central venous catheterization commonly apply patient undergoing cardiac surgery . The subclavian vein low risk infection provide patient comfort . However central venous catheterization may result complication pneumothorax , hemothorax arterial puncture . It suggest ultrasound ( US ) guidance could improve success rate , reduce number needle pass decrease complication . Two different real-time 2-dimensional US technique employ insertion central venous catheter . The first technique involve real-time US-guided cannulation subclavian vein use long axis/in-plane approach . The second one involve real-time US-guided use short axis/out-off-plane approach . However date study compare efficacy safety . The purpose study compare US-guided long-axis versus short-axis approach SCV catheterization adult critical care patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-versus Short-Axis Ultrasound Guidance Subclavian Vein Cannulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two technique use vessel visualization far different : The Short-Axis ( SA ) approach attempt view vessel cross-section venous access obtain . The strength SA approach vein center transducer midpoint transducer become reference point insertion needle , time possible visualize SC artery pleural line . SA approach easy learn novice sonologists . The Long-Axis ( LA ) approach employ technique view length vessel cannulation.For reason , LA approach possible visualize needle advance entire procedure soft tissue lumen vein , SC artery pleural line visualize scan . For LA approach , practice require keep needle precisely within image care must take avoid probe inadvertently move away target structure .</detailed_description>
