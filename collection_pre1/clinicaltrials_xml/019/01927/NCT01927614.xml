	<brief_summary>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) process immune non-immune mediate thicken heart artery transplant heart . CAV limit long term survival heart transplant patient one common cause death late post transplant period . Current method detect CAV rest invasive cardiac catheterization carry repeat risk , test need perform periodically life heart transplant patient . Traditional method coronary angiography identify CAV late course crude method evaluate coronary anatomy heart transplant patient . Intravascular ultrasound additive tool able detect early CAV become angiographically apparent , still require invasive cardiac catheterization perform . However , also limit assessment major epicardial artery give information regard small branch vessel cardiac microvasculature . Advances cardiac CT cardiac MRI hold potential evaluate CAV non-invasively . In addition , perfusion technique may provide additional functional information regard status microvascular . In pilot study , aim demonstrate feasibility cardiac CT cardiac MRI without perfusion protocol , patient post-heart transplant describe compare CT MRI find patient establish CAV versus CAV , diagnose standard invasive method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart transplantation viable treatment option select patient end-stage heart failure , 1-year survival rate heart transplantation approximate 85 % . Of survive first year , &gt; 90 % alive 5 year . In early post-transplant period , rejection donor heart due activation recipient immune system , worrisome complication common cause morbidity mortality . With time , risk rejection decline cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) represent common cause heart failure death heart transplant recipient . CAV form coronary artery disease transplant heart . It develop due variety immune non-immune mediate mechanism . It differ significantly coronary artery disease normal heart , affect artery size ( main artery visible coronary angiography ) involve thicken inner layer artery , rather surface line artery traditional coronary artery disease . Early CAV clinically silent . Patients often diagnosed routine coronary angiographic surveillance ( standard care ) , decline heart function surveillance imaging ( standard care ) , evidence organ rejection . Coronary angiography assessment heart function remain cornerstone diagnosis CAV . The main limitation angiography inability identify mild early disease , apparently normal angiogram underestimate presence CAV . Intra-vascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) coronary angiography evaluted adjunctive mordality assess diagnose early CAV . Certain IVUS parameter correlate high risk development CAV overall bad prognosis long term . Detection CAV important therapeutic prognostic implication . Once detected angiography , likelihood progression severe CAV within 5 year 19 % . The overall likelihood death re-transplantation result CAV approximately 50 % severe CAV . Changes make medical therapy target slow halt CAV progression patient evaluate re-transplantation sooner rather later , depend rate progression . Currently , CAV diagnose cardiac catheterization perform routine interval post transplant , without use IVUS . This invasive test complication include bleeding , vascular damage , renal failure , stroke , heart attack death . It low sensitivity identify early CAV . Recent advance cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) cardiac CT imaging ( CCT ) present unique opportunity investigate non-invasive modality CAV . To date , study field . We propose evaluate whether functional CCT and/or CMR perfusion abnormality , calcium score CCT , late gadolinium enhancement CMR , feasible heart transplant patient whether modality detect abnormality correlate cardiac catheterization result detect early CAV become angiographically apparent . This pilot study first kind heart transplant population . We aim demonstrate feasibility safety CCT/CMR heart transplant patient correlate specific CMR/CCT abnormality establish angiographic apparent CAV . This allow prospective evaluation excite non-invasive modality CAV detection large research study group . The clinical implication significant may reduce number invasive procedure perform identify CAV earlier , lead institution earlier therapy , proliferation signal inhibitor , may alter natural history disease effort prolong life transplant heart . Specific Objectives : Primary Objectives : 1 . The number patient adverse event CCT CMR 2 . Determine recruitment rate future study , logistics test , ability perform test Secondary Objectives : 1 . Describe CCT CMR image finding CAV 1 . Identify describe structural functional CMR abnormality establish angiographically apparent CAV use novel imaging protocol , include stress-rest perfusion imaging . 2 . Identify describe structural functional cardiac CT abnormality establish angiographically apparent CAV use novel imaging protocol , include stress-rest perfusion imaging . 2 . Correlation intimal thicken IVUS image cardiac catheterization CCT/CMR perfusion abnormality one year post heart transplant . 3 . Correlation CCT/CMR perfusion abnormality one year post heart transplant development angiographically apparent CAV , graft dysfunction , cardiac adverse event , overall survival long term , compare CCT CMR regard ( Cohort 1 &amp; 2 ) Study Design : Patients recruit 1 3 cohort heart transplant program QE II Health Science Center , Halifax Infirmary site , use protocol approve institutional research ethic board . Eligible patient schedule routine invasive coronary angiography , &gt; 18 year age , &gt; 12 month post-transplant able undergo CCT CMR . Exclusion criterion include creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) calculate &lt; 45ml/min , contraindication inability administer intravenous beta-blockers calcium channel blocker standard contraindication CMR , contrast medium , adenosine . Patients identify Dr. Brian Clarke involve care heart transplant patient QE II Health Science Centre Data analyze follow : 1 . Feasibility determine base successful rate recruitment completion CCT/CMR scan cohort 3 . 2 . Patients eligible cohort 3 require diagnosis CAV 1 time point post-transplant . The attend transplant cardiologist involve make assessment . More advanced CAV exclude . These patient analyze without comparator group . For CCT , calcium scoring , intimal thickening , perfusion abnormality describe analyzed correlation angiographic finding . CMR image describe late gadolinium enhancement , structural change , perfusion abnormality analyze correlation angiographic finding . In separate analysis , patient also compare cohort 2 determine non-invasive imaging difference CAV1 CAV0 patient . 3 . Cohort 1 analyzed separately ; compare MIT &lt; 0.5mm MIT &gt; 0.5mm difference CCT/CMR image perfusion abnormality . CCT compare CMR MIT subgroup . We anticipate identify perfusion abnormality MIT &gt; 0.5mm group perfusion abnormalities MIT &lt; 0.5mm . Patients cohort 1 follow long term development angiographically apparent CAV , adverse cardiac event , graft dysfunction , death . Results report mainly descriptive manner , data summarize percentage , mean median , applicable .</detailed_description>
