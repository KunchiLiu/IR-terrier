	<detailed_description>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) one leading cause cancer death worldwide , rank fourth male cancer-related death Taiwan . In HNSCC , invasiveness metastasis cancer cell contribute major cause mortality ; therefore , elucidation mechanism development new strategy metastasis utmost importance treat advanced HNSCC . Epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) process epithelial cell lose polarity convert mesenchymal phenotype , recently consider major mechanism cancer metastasis . The initiation EMT hallmarked suppression intercellular junctional protein E-cadherin variety transcriptional factor , include Twist1 , Snail , Slug , SIP1 , Zeb1 E47 . However , metastatic evolution , interplay different EMT inducer investigate limitedly . Previously study demonstrate hypoxia induces EMT HNSCC induction Twist1 expression . Additionally show Twist1 promotes EMT tumor-initiating capability upregulation Bmi1 , co-expression Twist1 Bmi1 predict bad prognosis HNSCC case . Accumulated evidence suggest microRNAs play essential role cancer progression metastasis . Therefore , aim investigate role microRNA Twist1-mediated cancer metastasis , interplay Twist1 EMT regulator . Our preliminary data show expression miR-29 family , include miR-29a , b , c increase Twist1-overexpressing HNSCC cell . Furthermore , discover SIN3A , co-repressor another EMT regulator Snail , target miR-29s . We therefore speculate Twist1 modifies function Snail microRNA machinery . In proposal , delineate regulatory mechanism Twist1-miR29s-SIN3A axis . We also investigate molecular interplay Twist1 Snail Twist1-miR29s-SIN3A signal pathway . Furthermore , elucidate molecular basis pathophysiologic significance Twist1-Snail interaction hypoxic environment . Finally , confirm vitro find vivo animal study HNSCC sample . These result provide crucial information understand molecular basis HNSCC metastasis , valuable develop new therapeutic strategy advance HNSCC .</detailed_description>
