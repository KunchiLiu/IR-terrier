	<brief_summary>The purpose study see long take prostate cancer come back patient surgery remove prostate gland ( radical prostatectomy ) , treat enzalutamide ( formerly know MDV3100 ) . Enzalutamide known androgen-receptor signal inhibitor , mean block activity male hormone , testosterone . Most prostate cancer dependent testosterone growth . In study , patient take enzalutamide surgery see keep cancer come back .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Patients With High-risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot phase II study evaluate clinical activity safety Enzalutamide ( formerly know MDV3100 ) novel androgen receptor ( AR ) inhibitor men high-risk prostate cancer undergone local definitive therapy radical prostatectomy . Primary Objectives : -To evaluate clinical efficacy enzalutamide patient high-risk prostate cancer regard : Time disease progression define biochemical recurrence ( BCR ) Secondary Objectives : -To evaluate safety enzalutamide patient high-risk prostate cancer Exploratory Objectives : - To determine presence circulate tumor cell patient high-risk prostate cancer . - To describe effect enzalutamide number circulate tumor ( CTCs ) patient detectable CTCs prior study entry . Patients receive daily oral therapy enzalutamide 160mg ( 4 capsule ) orally daily ( QD ) . Patients continue study progressive disease , drug intolerability , consent withdrawal completion study 24 month .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Patients must undergo Radical Prostatectomy ( surgical technique permit ) within 3 month study entry highrisk disease define follow : Pathological stage T3a , T3b , T4 ( grade iPSA ) Gleason ' sum ≥ 8 ( stage iPSA ) Initial Preoperative PSA ≥ 20ng/mL ( GS pT stage ) Any stage/PSA/Gleason patient 35 % great chance biochemical failure 5 year base Kattan 's nomogram http : //nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/PostRadicalProstatectomy . Patients Lymph node ( LN ) positive disease , regardless iPSA , pT stage GS provide postoperative PSA 68 week surgery ≤ 0.4ng/mL . ( Lymph node dissection desire mandate ) Able swallow study drug comply study requirement . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Testosterone ≥ 50 ng/dL per laboratory reference range Baseline PostRP PSA ≤ 0.4 Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL independent transfusion Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Platelet count ≥100,000/ìL Serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL Serum potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L Liver function : serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN ( except patient document Gilbert 's disease ) AST ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN Severe concurrent disease , infection , comorbidity , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment Prior radiotherapy prostate pelvis ( related prostate cancer ) . Concurrent adjuvant radiation therapy permit patient enrol trial . Prior use Abiraterone acetate cytotoxic chemotherapy prostate cancer Prior androgen deprivation Luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) permit provide testosterone level prior study entry recover normal limit per reference laboratory . No prior antiandrogen therapy ( bicalutamide , flutamide Nilutamide ) permit Prior use 5alpha reductase inhibitor permit provided medication stop 714 day prior enrollment Use herbal product may hormonal antiprostate cancer activity and/or know decrease PSA level ( e.g. , saw palmetto ) systemic corticosteroid great equivalent 10 mg prednisone per day within 2 week enrollment Active unresolved infection Known history central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases Patients must know history HIV Evidence metastatic disease evidence CT MRI abdomen pelvis and/or whole body bone scan ( WBS ) . To do prior treatment start 4 month prior radical prostatectomy date . History seizure condition may predispose seizure ( e.g. , prior cortical stroke , significant brain trauma ) . Also , history loss consciousness transient ischemic attack within 12 month enrollment . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease include : Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior Screening ; Uncontrolled angina within 3 month prior Screening ; Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class 3 4 , patient history congestive heart failure NYHA class 3 4 past , unless screen echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) perform within 3 month result leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45 % History clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g. , ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , torsades de pointes ) History Mobitz II second degree third degree heart block without permanent pacemaker place Hypotension indicate systolic blood pressure &lt; 86 mmHg Screening visit Bradycardia indicate heart rate &lt; 50 beat per minute Screening ECG Uncontrolled hypertension indicate systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 105 mmHg Screening visit Gastrointestinal disorder affect absorption ( e.g. , Gastrectomy , active peptic ulcer disease within last 3 month ) Any condition reason , opinion Investigator , interfere ability patient participate trial , place patient undue risk , complicate interpretation safety data . The effect enzalutamide develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dos unknown . Thus , men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 6 month usage enzalutamide . Should patient 's partner become pregnant suspect pregnant patient participate study , patient inform treat physician immediately .</criteria>
