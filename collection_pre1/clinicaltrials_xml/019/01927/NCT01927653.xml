	<brief_summary>The hypothesis test diffusion property base line , mean diffusivity kurtosis , differentiate two subtypes MCI predict clinical outcome Patients . The hypothesis support correlation measure diffusion property disease severity . We therefore proposed investigate potential value diffusion property possible tool monitor disease progression . The disease relate change neural connectivity investigate . 1 . The diffusion MRI could provide improved diagnosis Alzheimer 's Disease Mild cognitive Impairment . Explanation : The deposition macromolecules beta amyloid brain associate neuron death patient could lead observable change tissue microenvironment . The related change would lead alteration either amplitude distribution water diffusion . In turn could detect diffusion tensor kurtosis . 2. aMCI preclinical state AD dMCI different etiology , differentially diagnosis MRI . Diffusion Imaging could help predict clinical outcome Explanation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) refer decline cognition elder adult sufficient magnitude meet criterion dementia . It usually regard transition state patient Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) age match healthy adult . It heterogeneous syndrome divide two subtypes : amnestic dysexecutive . This 3 year proposal continue NSc fund project , report amnestic MCI could involve global white matter change therefore could preclinical status AD . In contrast , compromise white matter status find patient dysexecutive MCI . Therefore propose investigate phenomenon project . The subject divide 3 group : 30 patient amnestic MCI , 30 dysexecutive MCI 30 healthy age-matched normal control . Comprehensive neuropsychological examination perform detailed clinical history physical screening , include Mini-Mental Status Examination , Clinical Dementia Rating Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument . Successful candidate examine 3T MRI , include diffusion image high resolution T1 weight anatomical image . The current project propose examine sensitivity specificity diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging , diagnosis MCI differential diagnosis two subtypes . Both conventional tensor derive index diffusion kurtosis compare . This due fact recently publication Radiology , report improved diagnostic performance neurodegenerative disease diffusion kurtosis diffusion tensor . Secondly examine regional change diffusion property correlate white matter involvement patient . High resolution track density image implement compare susceptibility weight image effort address underlying change pathophysiology . In third year , prognostic value diffusion MRI determine . The optimal cutoff value diffusion MRI prediction conversion Alzheimer 's disease report . The diffusion property patient early conversion ( 2nd year ) late conversion ( 3rd year ) compare . It expect change diffusion use image base surrogate marker neurodegenerative process . The new insight temporal evolution diffusion MRI might help understand underlie etiology pathophysiology amnestic dysexecutive MCI patient , contribute early intervention strategy might ultimately lead effective treatment .</detailed_description>
