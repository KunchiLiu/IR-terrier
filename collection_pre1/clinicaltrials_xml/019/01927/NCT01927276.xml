	<brief_summary>Out 300 million person United States , one-half one percent , 1.5 million , diagnosis schizophrenia . Schizophrenia begin young adulthood , often chronic disable remainder life course ] , short general population much 25 year . The cost schizophrenia United States estimate $ 30 $ 60 billion dollar annually . Treatment schizophrenia marginally successful : Clinical Antipsychotic Trials Intervention Effectiveness ( CATIE ) , example , medication prescribe begin trial stop change nearly 75 % completion trial 18 month later . The medication limit effect negative symptom cognitive impairment schizophrenia , many severe permanent side effect . The basic hypothesis underlie treatment schizophrenia change half century . New treatment need . Much accumulate evidence suggest sensitivity gluten may relate symptom etiology schizophrenia gluten free diet may lead significant symptom resolution , patient know antibody gluten . Gluten sensitivity may common thought stem different etiology symptom presentation Celiac Disease . The investigator analysis CATIE sample show 23 % person schizophrenia ( compare 3 % healthy control ) Gluten Sensitivity ( 300,000 person United States ) identification gliadin positive antibody blood . The investigator hypothesize people biomarker could robust symptom improvement removal antigen diet ( gluten ) . If half people schizophrenia antibody substantially benefit removal gluten diet , case study certain subject clinical trial , would provide new transformative treatment option identifiable subpopulation people schizophrenia would enormous benefit patient , family society . Another benefit public 's health study enhance knowledge etiology schizophrenia , include possible linkage neuropsychiatric disease immune system activation , identification novel , immune-linked treatment target . The result research could lead screen Anti-Gliadin Antibodies early life first episode schizophrenia , recommend already . Screening involve financial emotional cost , good evidence need recommendation justified . Moreover , new treatment paradigm remove gluten diet mean gluten block medication ( already early study ) could advance treatment significantly . This study test efficacy , pilot fashion , 20 participant double blind five week randomize placebo control gluten free diet vs identical diet gluten gliadin-positive individual schizophrenia . Approximately equal number receive addition gluten , non-gluten starch , identical form ( give flour food ) . The investigator plan develop mechanisms procedure locate , screen , recruit subject inpatient intervention study , retain inpatient phase . Once admitted baseline assessment may take approximately day mostly complete first week prior 5 week randomization , thus patient may stay longer 5 week . At end double blind trial investigator prepare discharge test feasibility successfully maintain gluten free diet intervention phase complete , least two month .</brief_summary>
