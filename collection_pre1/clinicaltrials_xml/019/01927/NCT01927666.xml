	<brief_title>The Conversion ENcapsulated GlucorAphanin , Gut Microbiota Phylogeny gEnotype Study ( ENGAGE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucosinolates ( GSLs ) non-volatile sulphur-containing phytochemical ( secondary metabolite ) find plant tissue cruciferous crop , broccoli , cabbage watercress . Glucosinolates accumulate food glucoraphanin predominant glucosinolate find broccoli . When tissue disrupt glucosinolates convert isothiocyanate ( ITCs ) enzyme myrosinase . Sulforaphane predominant ITC obtain enzymatic hydrolysis glucoraphanin . When vegetable cook thoroughly myrosinase enzyme denature result GSLs pass gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract colon . The ITCs show animal study exert diverse biological effect , anti-oxidant effect ; anti-inflammatory property ; inhibition platelet aggregation ; reduction systolic blood pressure reduction cholesterol level ; reduce risk develop cardiovascular disease . Sulforaphane link health benefit human , cancer chemoprevention help maintain healthy heart . When cook cruciferous vegetable , myrosinase enzyme inactivate , consume , microflora colon produce myrosinase-like enzyme also convert glucosinolates ITCs . This process gut microbiota conversion glucoraphanin ITC abolish enteric antibiotic bowel cleanse . There several vitro study perform pure mixed culture bacteria confirm ability bacterial strain find within human gut ability metabolize GSLs culture . It show extent conversion GSLs ITCs human gut microbiota varies greatly individual conversion rate repeat determination within individual much consistent . A recent study attempt correlate conversion glucosinolate ex vivo human gut bacteria vivo data glucosinolate metabolism small number individual , however specific link individual bacterial special establish . Our study human dietary intervention participant consume one capsule contain 100mg purified glucoraphanin broccoli . The level glucoraphanin deliver capsule similar one two portion broccoli . As purified glucoraphanin myrosinase enzyme present . All conversion glucoraphanin , contain within capsule , ITC therefore occur enzyme find gut microbiota . The ability glucoraphanin capsule metabolise ITCs gut microflora unknown assess measure ITCs excrete urine . In brief participant study request abstain glucosinolate ITC contain food three day prior dietary intervention , 24 hour intervention . They request fast overnight prior study day intervention morning fast collect urine sample . This effectively constitute negative control sample use measure compliance dietary restriction . The participant give glucoraphanin capsule along breakfast . The dietary restriction continue 24hours , time participant collect urine produce . The ITCs quantify urine HP-LC LC-MS use validated analytical method . Once 24 hour urine collection complete dietary restriction cease . It show human dietary intervention study extent conversion glucosinolates varies greatly . In order ass possible causative factor variation rate glucoraphanin metabolism participant provide faecal sample faecal gut microbiota phylogeny analyse . A detailed description sample collect along equipment necessary provide . The faecal sample return study scientist within two hour production order maintain faecal bacteria viability . For small number participant second faecal sample request ( maximum 3 participant ) . The aim select one low , one medium one high ITC excreter . Ideally low high excreters would within low high 5 % excretion ITC third participant close mean ITC excretion possible . The aim culture faecal microbiota time repeat dose glucoraphanin order select microbiota able metabolise glucoraphanin . It know main hydrolysis product glucoraphanin , sulforaphane , variety benefit human health , however know clinical relevance high , medium low excreter ITC . Several epidemiological intervention study suggest health benefit physiological response cruciferous vegetable may mediate individual 's GSTM1 genotype ( glutathione-S-transferases ( GST ) gene family ) . When ITCs absorb body , conjugate glutathione metabolise mercapturic acid pathway . Conjugation happen spontaneously due relatively high concentration glutathione within cell compare ITC concentration . However non-conjugated ITCs occur plasma , stage must dissociation ITC-thiol conjugate . It think may catalyze GSTM1 enzyme . Approximately 50 % population homologous deletion GSTM1 gene result null genotype , 20 % deletion GSTT1 gene . There study , include one , suggest GSTM1 genotype may affect rate ITC excretion urine , suggest GSTM1 genotype affect peak plasma ITC concentration . Unpublished result previous intervention , Diet Vascular Health study ; Clinical Trials.gov : NCT01114399 add credence notion GSTM1 null metabolise sulforaphane different manner functional GSTM1 allele . Along GST gene family association cruciferous vegetable may gene interest may able determine extent glucoraphanin conversion sulforaphane . Work carry previous intervention , Diet Vascular Health study seek investigate possible candidate gene . With substantial amendment look take global approach identify candidate gene interest perform Affymetrix SNP analysis sample participant high glucoraphanin diet . Therefore GSTM1 genotype , yet , unidentified candidate gene participant determine ass whether genotype affect rate ITC excretion urine , either alone , combination phylogenic profile . A 5 ml blood sample take participant DNA extract , PCR use test whether gene present .</detailed_description>
