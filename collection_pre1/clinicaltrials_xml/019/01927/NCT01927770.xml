	<brief_summary>Background : The purpose study investigate process consent participant whole exome/genome sequencing outcome . It unknown best consent people new technology . NO GENOME SEQUENCING IS OFFERED AS PART OF THIS STUDY . This protocol companion NIH study involve genomic sequencing . Participants must enrol parent NIH study collaborate consent study eligible . Currently involve one NIH study . Objectives : - To learn best way help participant understand sequence , decide whether join study use . Eligibility : - Adults least 18 year old enrol National Institutes Health ( NIH ) study use WES/WGS . - Adults least 18 year old whose child enrol NIH study use WES/WGS . Design : - Participants take part study either person phone . - Participants review two sequence consent form genetic counselor . - Before meet counselor , participant answer several question sequence . Each questionnaire take 15 minute . - Six week later , participant answer question sequence . This take 15 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consent participant study include whole exome whole genome sequencing ( WES/WGS ) study receive result present challenge achieve informed consent due scope , depth uncertainty information . NIH Intramural study increasingly involve WES/WGS identify elusive primary variant . This umbrella protocol aim compare evidence-based consent WES/WGS standard consent collaboration ongoing future NIH study . An equivocal hypothesis test evaluate whether informed choice perception uncertainty differ two consent group . A mixed-methods design propose start qualitative mental-model pilot study revise expert opinion consent intervention integrate lay-person response preference . Following development evidence-based intervention , randomize twofactor design use quantitative survey study conduct conjunction number NIH study conduct WES/WGS test difference two consent model . A descriptive analysis audiotaped consent process also conduct assess difference content extent process , relate outcome satisfaction decisional conflict also assess .</detailed_description>
