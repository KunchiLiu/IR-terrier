	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection global health problem , especially endemic area like Taiwan , 3 million chronic hepatitis B carrier . Patients chronic HBV infection increase risk develop cirrhosis , may disastrous complication , include hepatic decompensation , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The liver cirrhosis relate complication account 8th lead cause death Taiwan ; whereas , HCC 2nd lead cause death among cancer . Therefore , prudent develop strategy prevent halt progression liver cirrhosis . For HBV patient already cirrhosis , main treatment objective reduce risk complication . A large-scale multicenter clinical trial show viral suppression use lamivudine patient advanced fibrosis effectively decrease risk HCC liver-related complication . This study highlight importance treat HBV-related cirrhosis patient ; however , several issue remain addressed . The first issue clinical trial enrol patient positive HBeAg HBV-DNA level &gt; 1.4 x105 IU/mL . However , current recommend threshold cirrhotic patient start anti-viral treatment 2000 IU/mL . Whether anti-HBV therapy benefit cirrhotic patient level still unclear . Second , lamivudine use clinical trial ; however , high resistant rate lamivudine treatment probably lower protective effect HCC . Whether potent anti-HBV agent extremely low resistance profile , entecavir , beneficial HBV-related cirrhotic patient also unclear . The Bureau National Health Institute launch reimbursement program anti-HBV therapy since 2003 extended program cirrhotic patient HBV DNA level &gt; 2000 IU/mL long-term use since Aug , 2010 . Taking advantage , may explore above-mentioned clinical question easily . To address issue , first retrospectively collect cohort HBV-related cirrhosis patient . All patient enrol time oral anti-HBV therapy widely use . We determine baseline serum HBV-DNA level use store serum enrol baseline HBV-DNA level higher 2000 IU/mL historical control . Second , enroll retrospective cohort HBV-related cirrhotic patient 2008 HBV-DNA level higher 2000 IU/mL receive indefinite therapy entecavir . By compare two cohort , able clarify whether indefinite viral suppression entecavir beneficial cirrhotic patient . With comprehensive analysis , wish document re-setting risk level HBV DNA 140,000 IU/mL 2,000 IU/mL beneficial HBV-related cirrhotic patient long-term entecavir low risk HCC . These line evidence assist deliver appropriate aggressive treatment high-risk patient .</brief_summary>
