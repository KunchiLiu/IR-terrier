	<brief_summary>The main purpose study assess effective tolerable country specific clinical practice guideline SLTs UK , France Sweden . The main rationale behind study well control comparison various laxative treatment OIC lacking . There lack evidence suggest laxative combination laxatives optimal manage OIC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single-arm , Study Assess Effect Tolerability Standardised Laxative Therapy ( SLT ) Reversal Opioid-induced Constipation ( OIC ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study comprise nine study visit total duration study 42-52 day Potential subject , age 18 year , OIC screen entry study Visit 1 Eligible subject attend 7-day Screening Period ( Visit 1 ) . This follow 28-day Treatment Period ( visit 2 8 : ) , make four clinic visit schedule 7 day apart ( visit 5 ( day 7 ) , 6 ( day 14 ) , 7 ( day 21 ) , 8 ( day 28 ) : day 7 28 ) two telephone visit ( visit 3 4 ) take place first week Treatment Period . There 7-day Follow-up Period follow-up phone call conclude study ( Visit 9 ) . Study assessment/ evaluation include vital sign measurement , ECG , safety lab , pregnancy test physical examination assessment , AEs , Investigator subject questionnaire subject daily diary .

	<criteria>Male female subject least 18 year Females less one year postmenopausal must negative pregnancy test prior first dose study medication , nonlactating , willing use adequate highly effective method contraception throughout study . ( A highly effective method birth control define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly e.g . sterilisation , implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( ( IUDs ) , hormonal ) , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner ) . Documented history malignant nonmalignant pain require aroundtheclock opioid therapy ( WHO step II/III opioid analgesic ) . Subjects treat WHO step II/III opioid analgesic least 2 week prior Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) , continue opioid ( ) propose study period . Subjects meet follow criterion OIC : Subject Investigator confirm Subject 's constipation induce , worsen Subject 's opioid medication ( present Screening ) Subjects mean BFI score &gt; 30 Visit 1 Subjects &lt; 3 complete bowel movement ( CBMs ) week precede Visit 1 , base Subject 's retrospective memory response Investigator 's question . Subjects take least one laxative regular basis ( i.e . ≥2 intake per week ≥2 week prior screen ) treatment OIC . Subjects must willing take SLT . Subjects take daily natural dietary fibre supplementation eligible maintain diet throughout study , Investigator 's opinion willing able maintain adequate hydration . Subjects must willing able ( e.g . mental physical condition ) participate aspect study , include use medication , completion subjective evaluation , attend schedule clinic visit , complete telephone contact , compliance protocol requirement evidence provide write , informed consent . In Investigator 's opinion Subject 's concomitant medication dose remain stable throughout study Period ( concomitant medication mean medication besides opioids ( standard rescue opioid treatment ) ) . Medical Conditions : In Investigator 's opinion contraindication precautionary condition laxative medication ( ) use study per SmPC . Subjects potential nonopioid cause constipation might major contributor . Surgery within 2 month prior start Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) , plan surgery Screening Treatment period may affect GI motility . Subjects colostomy ileostomy . Hospitalisation expected/planned within study Period ( e.g . plan hospitalisation treatment preexist condition inform consent ) affect outcome measure analysis . Treatments/Medications : • Subjects presently take , take opioid antagonist ( e.g . naloxone , naltrexone methylnaltrexone ) opioid antagonist contain product ( e.g . oxycodone/naloxone , buprenorphine/naloxone , pentazocine/naloxone , tilidine/naloxone ) &lt; 30 day prior start Screening Period . Subjects already take maximum daily dose country specific SLT ( First Second Line SLT ) regular basis ( i.e . ≥4 day per week ) treatment OIC . Subjects receive opioid substitution therapy opioid addiction ( e.g . methadone buprenorphine ) . Additional Screening Exclusion Criteria Subjects Suffering Nonmalignant Pain : Subjects participate clinical research study involve new chemical entity experimental drug within 30 day study entry Additional Screening Exclusion Criteria Subjects Suffering Malignant Pain : Subjects receive new chemical entity experimental drug within 30 day study entry ( defined Visit 1 ) . Concurrent participation another clinical trial permit except epidemiological study perform assess longterm survival data . Subjects expect life expectancy &lt; 3 month .</criteria>
