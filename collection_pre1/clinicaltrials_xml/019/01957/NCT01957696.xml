	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The first pancreas transplantation ( PTx ) perform Minnesota 1966 Kelly colleague ( 1 ) . In recent year number procedure grow considerably worldwide , well establish treatment option patient diabetes mellitus without concomitant diabetic End-Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) ( 2-4 ) . The indication PTx advance and/or badly control diabetes mellitus ( `` brittle '' diabetes , severe hypoglycemic episode , `` unawareness '' , etc ) . Solitary pancreas transplantation ( SPT ; without concomitant kidney transplantation ) usually classified PTx alone ( PTA ) , PTx kidney transplantation ( PAK ) PTx islet transplantation ( PAI ) . Kidney transplantation diabetic uremic population increase survival compare long-term dialysis ( 5 , 6 ) . Transplant option patient diabetic end-stage nephropathy include simultaneous pancreas-kidney ( SPK ) , live donor kidney ( LDK ) decease donor kidney ( DDK ) transplantation . SPK transplantation relieve patient 's uremia , also alleviate hyperglycaemic state diabetes . Large international patient registry show patient survival rate SPK reach 95 % 1 year 87 % 5 year post-transplant , respectively ( 2 ) . Nevertheless , PTx treatment type 1 diabetes gain popularity transplantation organ , partly PTx associate high rate surgical complication ; particularly bleeding , thrombosis exocrine leakage . Furthermore , lack reliable , non-invasive rejection monitoring instrument , invasive , percutaneous pancreas biopsy associate high rate complication . The difficulty encounter PTx extent compensate selective attitude towards donor , thereby make pancreas graft scarce resource . In contrast abdominal transplantation liver transplantation ( LTx ) kidney transplantation ( KTx ) , repeat biopsy use immunosurveillance , percutaneous biopsy pancreas-graft traditionally avoid due high rate biopsy-related complication ( exocrine leaks/fistulas bleed episode ) . Thus , fear acute rejection lack adequate rejection marker , lead rather intensive immunosuppressive load PTx recipient . Solitary pancreas transplantation ( SPT ) traditionally subject even high complication rejection rate , inferior graft patient survival - thus favor combine SPK procedure . This attribute even bad rejection monitoring capability , without `` reporter '' allograft kidney . No biochemical marker proven effective rejection surveillance . Pancreas graft thrombosis fear complication postoperative course , partly due oversized vessel use ( coeliac trunk/superior mesenteric artery/portal vein ) conjunction low blood flow isolate pancreas graft . In native setting , vessel also serve intestine spleen . Therefore , PTx pose delicate balance thrombosis bleed complication . The Norwegian experience : PTx perform one single national centre Oslo , 1983 date 300 procedure perform ( 7-11 ) . In recent year , activity increase , reach 28 2012 . Approximately 9 10 PTx 's SPK 's . In first period 1983 1987 , duct-occluded segmental pancreas use transplantation . From 1988 , whole pancreas graft use , exocrine secretion drain anastomose duodenal segment urinary bladder . This technical solution choose partly offer sort rejection monitoring , urine amylase count cystoscopic pancreas biopsy . However , many patient suffer chemical cystitis metabolic acidosis , due loss bicarbonate . In 1998 urinary bladder anastomosis abandon , favor physiological enteric anastomosis , duodenal segment connect proximal jejunum . However , solution offer even less option monitor upcoming rejection , percutaneous biopsy mostly avoid due previously mention hazard . The investigator recently examine ( 12 ) PTx 's performed investigator ' hospital 2006-2010 ( n=61 ; 59 SPK , 2 PTA ) . The investigator ' overall surgical complication rate decrease earlier year , still suffer substantial rate reoperations ( 30 % patient ) , mainly cause exocrine leakage , bleed vein thrombosis . When compare population without reoperation , high donor age significant negative impact . No significant effect donor age graft survival observe . There tendency towards well result female recipient , regard surgical complication graft survival . The rejection rate ( altogether 30 % ) significantly high graft loss group . From late 2011 , several measure implement improve outcome reduce rate surgical complication . In line Tx centre Scandinavia , investigator switch prophylactic anticoagulation treatment investigator ' traditional Macrodex® regime Heparin®/Fragmin® regime . Several technical change also implement recent year ; atraumatic graft procurement , preserve entire coeliac arterial axis include gastroduodenal artery , obtain long portal vein without need elongation , well extend situ dissection mean LigaSure . Due conventional lack rejection monitoring parameter , investigator launch investigatory surveillance program , protocol biopsy duodenal segment via double balloon enteroscopy ( 13 ) . The impact value program yet investigate . Previous report describe separate rejection pancreas kidney SPK setting , gold standard prove rejection pancreas undoubtedly biopsy pancreas . This encourage u develop technique good surveillance , Endoscopic transduodenal UltraSound-guided Pancreas Biopsies ( EUSPB ) . Inferior outcome PTA lack valid tool immunosurveillance absence simultaneous kidney graft , lead center evolve duodenoduodenostomy ( DD ) drainage exocrine pancreas , make EUSPB possible . There many theoretical advantage DD , especially regard rejection surveillance , recently adopt technique . The endoscopic access afford DD also make possible stent pancreatic duct case exocrine leakage . Immunosuppressive therapy : Over time , induction therapy maintenance immunosuppressive protocol change . From 1983 2000 , recipient receive triple immunosuppressive regimen cyclosporine , azathioprine prednisolone ( CS ) . During last part 1990 's azathioprine substitute Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , cyclosporine substitute tacrolimus . After 2000 , immunosuppression intensify induction therapy PTx ( Antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) ) kidney transplant alone ( basiliximab ) . Thus recent year , PTx recipients receive quadruple immunosuppressive regimen , include tacrolimus , MMF , high dose CS ATG . The dosage ATG direct T-cell count . 2 . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY Several study show acceptable result PTx substitute ATG basiliximab ( 14-18 ) , consider convey considerably low number adverse event . However , investigator ' experience ATG PTx ( introduced 2004 ) good , investigator presumably gentle way administrate drug - direct T-cell count - fact unique ( 12 ) . The potential advantage reduce overall corticosteroid ( CS ) load obvious , CS well-known pro-diabetic agent cause severe long term adverse effect ( 14 ) . On background , recently reduce CS dosing ( routine protocol ) level correspond Kidney Tx protocol ( valid since 2009 ) . Thus , intend prospectively investigate compare single cohort present PTx immunosuppressive protocol previous ( historical ) cohort . The rationale study ; ) high immunosuppressive load , particular CS , may partly responsible high rate PTx associate complications/reoperations ; ii ) high immunosuppressive load relate infectious complication ; iii ) improve PTx rejection surveillance DD EUSBP allow lower-graded immunosuppressive protocol ; iv ) evaluate surgical medical measure make PTx programme past two year For detailed description objectives/aims : See `` Outcome measure '' . 3 . STUDY DESIGN This prospective , single cohort observational study , aim use historical control group comparison . It conduct single , national centre organ transplantation Oslo . All pancreas recipient &gt; 18 year age , fulfill inclusion criterion , prior transplantation ask inclusion . 4 . DURATION OF STUDY All consecutive PTx recipient 3-5 year plan enrol , intend number 60-80 patient . The study continue patient complete minimum 60 month follow-up discontinue participation study . 5 . NUMBER OF PATIENTS 60-80 patient enrol study receive standard quadruple immunosuppressive regime reduce CS dose compare previous cohort ( accord newly change routine protocol ) . 6 . SELECTION OF PATIENTS See `` Eligibility Criteria '' . 7 . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 7.1 Immunosuppression The single cohort study group receive routine immunosuppressive regimen base ATG , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil corticosteroid follow : 7.1.1 ATG ( Thymoglobulin ) : Initiated day 0 ( first dose preoperatively ) dose 2,5 mg/kg i.v . Later dose direct T-cell count daily . The T-cells keep suppressed 10 day post-Tx , new dos 1,0-2,5 mg/kg i.v . give whenever T-cell count rise 0,050 x109 . Altogether , 2-4 dos ATG usually need . 7.1.2 Tacrolimus : Initiated day 0 ( first dose preoperatively ) dose 0,06 mg/kg x 2 p.o. , later adjust achieve steady state whole-blood trough level follow : Month 1-3 8-12 ng/ml Month 3-6 4-8 ng/ml 7.1.3 Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) : MMF give 1000 mg twice daily . It reduce 750mg twice daily case adverse event 500mg case persist adverse event . 7.1.4 Corticosteroids : Day 0 : Methylprednisolone 250 mg i.v . ( peroperatively ) Day 1-14 : Prednisolone 20 mg x 1 p.o . Day 15-28 : Prednisolone 15 mg x 1 p.o . Day 29-60 : Prednisolone 10 mg x 1 p.o . Day 61- 180 : Prednisolone 7,5 mg x 1 p.o . Day 181 - : Prednisolone 5 mg x 1 p.o . 7.2 Concomitant Treatments 7.2.1 Required treatment ) Prophylaxis development Pneumocystis carinii , trimethoprim-sulfa required patient first 6 month treatment . ii ) Prophylaxis Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) valganciclovir 3 month , donor CMV + recipient CMV ÷ . - By CMV constellation , preemptive valganciclovir treatment give , base weekly CMV-PCR analysis ( cut : CMV-PCR count &gt; 0 ) . iii ) Antibiotic prophylaxis meropenem ( 2 dos ) vancomycin ( 1 dose ) day 0 . ( iv ) Proton pump inhibitor ( pantoprazole/esomeprazole ) give least 2 month post-Tx . 7.2.2 Prohibited treatment ) Investigational study drug ii ) NSAID 's avoided iii ) Terfenadine , cisapride , astemizole , pimozide , cimetidine ketoconazole allow . 8 . ANALYSES OF RESULTS 8.1 Power calculation By conventional presumption ( Power 1-β=80 % , α=0,05 ) base binomial distribution , 3-400 patient ( 3-400 historical control ) would need detect 33 % relative change rejection/complication rate . However , regard practicability : ( ) It totally unrealistic - Tx-center world - include 3-400 PTx patient , reasonable time frame . In Oslo , investigator far high volume center Scandinavia . The investigator ' 28 PTx 's performed 2012 represent 5,6 p.m.p . ( per million population ) , actually far high country world . Even investigator cooperate PTx center Scandinavia ( Uppsala/Göteborg/Helsinki ) , potential would exceed 50 patient per year . ( ii ) The maximally realistic number PTx patient include Oslo reasonable time frame ( 2-3 year ) 60-80 . ( iii ) Thus , investigator ' intention regard statistical Power modest - single cohort observational study . And double rejection rate detect 80 % Power 42 patient . ( iv ) The prospects/visions study consist lot detect significant change rejection/complication rate . The simultaneous biopsy strategy ( D- + P- + K-biopsies ) unique . And 'molecular biology ' analysis simultaneous biopsy blood sample potential provide new insight . Furthermore , `` new '' potential rejection marker ( C-peptide ; CRP/Amylase/Lipase combine parameter ) explore . 8.2 Statistical method data analysis - The analysis categorical parameter consist : ) Comparisons group use Fisher exact test . ii ) Confidence interval 95 % percentage incidence event . - The loss graft death analyze Kaplan-Meier method estimate time event . - Continuous ( non-categorical ) variable analyze student t-tests chi-square test .</detailed_description>
