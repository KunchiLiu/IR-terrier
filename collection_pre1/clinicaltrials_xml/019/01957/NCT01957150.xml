	<criteria>Informed consent : Subjects must give sign dated write informed consent participate . Gender : Male female subject . Female subject must postmenopausal use highly effective method avoidance pregnancy . The decision include exclude woman childbearing potential may make discretion investigator accordance local practice relation adequate contraception . Age : &gt; = 40 year age Screening ( Visit 1 ) COPD diagnosis : Subjects clinical history COPD accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society : COPD preventable treatable disease characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence . Tobacco use : Subjects current prior history &gt; =10 packyears cigarette smoke screening ( Visit 1 ) . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day/20 ) x number year smoke Note : Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate pack year history . Severity Disease : Subject measure postalbuterol/salbutamol Forced expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) /forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Subjects measure postalbuterol/salbutamol 50 % &lt; =FEV1 &lt; =70 % predict normal value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) reference equation Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Native Hip : Have least one evaluable native hip . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD ) . Alpha1antitrypsin deficiency : Subjects alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD . Other respiratory disorder : Subjects tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Lung resection transplantation : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening Visit 1 lung transplant . Chest Xray : Subjects chest Xray ( Computer Axial Tomography ( CT ) scan ) reveal evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . A chest Xray take Screening Visit 1 chest Xray CT scan available within 12 month prior Visit 1 . Poorly control COPD : Subjects poorly control COPD , define occurrence follow 12 week prior Screening Visit 1 : Acute worsen COPD manage subject corticosteroid antibiotic require treatment prescribed physician require hospitalization . Moderate severe COPD exacerbation lower respiratory tract infection : Subjects 2 moderate severe COPD exacerbation and/or low respiratory tract infection ( include pneumonia ) within 12 month prior Screening Visit 1 experience moderate severe COPD exacerbation and/or lower respiratory infection ( include pneumonia ) RunIn period . NOTE : A moderate COPD exacerbation define require systemic corticosteroid and/or antibiotic . A severe COPD exacerbation define require hospitalization . Abnormal clinically significant laboratory finding : Subjects abnormal , clinically significant find liver chemistry , biochemical , haematology test Screening Visit 1 upon repeat prior randomization . Abnormal clinically significant 12lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : Subjects abnormal , clinically significant ECG find Screening Visit 1 . NonCompliance RunIn Period : Failure demonstrate adequate compliance runin medication ( &lt; 80 % compliant ) , ability withhold COPD medication , keep clinic visit appointment . Bone disorders/conditions : Subjects historical current evidence bone cancer , severe scoliosis , rheumatoid arthritis , metabolic bone disease ( osteoporosis ) include hyperor hypoparathyroidism , Paget 's disease bone , osteomalacia , osteogenesis imperfecta . Removal vertebrae L1 L4 lumbar spine and/or presence metal implant device , plate , rod , screw lumbar spine and/or hip . Immobility : Wheel chair bound paraplegic . Low vitamin D : Previously know lowserum 25hydroxy vitamin D concentration ( le 10ng [ 25nmoles ] per liter ) . Other diseases/abnormalities : Serious , uncontrolled disease ( include serious psychological disorder ) likely interfere study within 3year study . Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . Carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude subject consider cure within 5 year since diagnosis . Drug/food allergy : Subjects history hypersensitivity study medication ( e.g . betaagonists , corticosteroid ) component inhalation powder ( e.g . lactose , magnesium stearate ) . In addition , patient history severe milk protein allergy , opinion study physician , contraindicate subject 's participation also exclude . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year . Prohibited medication prior spirometry Visit 1 : Subjects medically unable withhold follow medication prior spirometry test Visit 1 No use within 48 hour ( hr ) prior Visit 1 Spirometry Testing : Inhaled corticosteroid , Inhaled Inhaled Corticosteroids ( ICS ) / long acting beta2agonist ( LABA ) combination product , Longacting anticholinergic ( e.g. , tiotropium ) , Theophylline preparation , Oral leukotriene inhibitor ( zafirlukast , montelukast , zileuton ) , Oral PDE4 inhibitor ( e.g . roflumilast ) , Oral betaagonists ( Longacting ) , Inhaled long act beta2agonist ( LABA ) Indacaterol . No use within 24 hrs prior Visit 1 Spirometry Testing : Other inhaled LABAs ( e.g. , salmeterol ) , Inhaled sodium cromoglycate nedocromil sodium . No use within 12 hrs prior Visit 1 Spirometry Testing : Oral betaagonists ( Shortacting ) . No use within 4 hrs prior Visit 1 Spirometry Testing : Ipratropium/ albuterol ( salbutamol ) combination product , Inhaled shortacting beta2agonists , Shortacting anticholinergic ( e.g. , ipratropium bromide ) . Additional medication : Use follow medication within follow time interval prior Visit 1 study ( unless otherwise specify ) : No use within 12 week prior Screening Visit 1 thereafter time study ( unless otherwise specify ) : Depot corticosteroid . No use within 30 day prior Screening Visit 1 thereafter time study ( unless otherwise specify ) : Systemic , Oral , parenteral , intraarticular corticosteroid ( Subjects may take course systemic corticosteroid , necessary , treatment exacerbation doubleblind treatment period ) . No use within 30 day 5 half life whichever longer prior Screening Visit 1 thereafter time study ( unless otherwise specify ) : Any investigational drug . COPD medication : Use ICS , longacting beta2agonists ( LABA ) , ICS/LABA combination product ( studyprovided doubleblind study medication ) Visit 2 ( Randomization ) doubleblind treatment period . Oxygen therapy : Subjects receive treatment longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) nocturnal oxygen therapy require great 12 hour day . Oxygen prn use ( i.e. , &lt; =12 hour per day ) exclusionary . Noncompliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Questionable validity consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study . Affiliation investigator site : Study investigator , subinvestigators , study coordinator , employee participate investigator immediate family member aforementioned excluded participating study .</criteria>
