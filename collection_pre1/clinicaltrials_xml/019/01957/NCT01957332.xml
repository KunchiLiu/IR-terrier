	<brief_summary>Current patient work-up , include conventional imaging pathological assessment one single biopsy , might insufficient identify metastatic breast cancer patient , possibly benefit first-line anti-hormonal anti-HER2 therapy . As receptor conversion tumor find quite frequently molecular heterogeneity occur within one patient , up-to-date whole body information necessary determine estrogen receptor ( ER ) and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) receptor status subsequently guide therapy decision . With molecular image via PET information obtain non-invasive , patient friendly way . Furthermore , improve individualize treatment able identify ( new ) drug target biomarkers , sample venous blood , circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) , well circulate tumor DNA , microRNA ( miRNA ) molecular characterization one metastasis beginning , feasible , additional biopsy therapy , necessary .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient selection hormone therapy anti-HER2 therapy base presence respective target , ER HER2 , currently assess tumor tissue molecular biological technique . In primary breast cancer , ER HER2 powerful predictor response ER HER2 target treatment , drive treatment decision . If receptor absent , target hormone anti-HER2 therapy administer chemotherapy therapeutic option leave . MBC management oncology practice often base ER HER2 status primary tumor . However , biopsy metastasis consider part standard work MBC , view potential conversion ER HER2 course disease . In contrast primary breast cancer , prospective study do evaluate impact ( convert ) receptor status metastasis , prognosis prediction response subsequent target therapy . Although receptor conversion MBC well know phenomenon , clinician may refrain biopsy take , instance would require highly invasive procedure . Even feasible , biopsy reflect ER HER2 status single lesion , disregard potential heterogeneity expression ER HER2 status within metastatic lesion . Therefore , current standard work MBC adequate enough invasive relevant proportion MBC patient drive treatment decision . As result , patient incorrectly receive ineffective treatment potentially toxic effect . Meanwhile , effective treatment patient may delay even deny ( chemotherapy anti-HER2 base therapy ) inadequate assessment ER HER2 status . This show need obtain up-to-date whole body information information characteristic different metastasis within patient . Non-invasive 18F-fluoroestradiol ( 18F-FES ) -PET Zirconium-89 ( 89Zr ) -trastuzumab-PET scan technique able visualize ER HER2 metastatic lesion throughout whole body , may therefore - patient friendly way- provide comprehensive information ( i.e . primary tumor various metastatic lesion ) ER HER2 status . Furthermore , optimal selection right treatment right patient may reduce unnecessary toxicity , also health care cost . Although various study already indicate clinical utility 18F-FES-PET 89Zr-trastuzumab-PET , prospective data yet available assess predictive value ( 14-19 ) . Therefore , clear new technique , also aspects cost-effectiveness , need prospectively evaluate within framework establish assessment ( include metastasis biopsy FDG-PET ) , ensure implementation standard care .</detailed_description>
