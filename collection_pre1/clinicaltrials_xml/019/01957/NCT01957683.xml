	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety feasibility eCLIPs™ Family Products treatment unruptured intracranial bifurcation aneurysm conjunction embolization coil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canadian eCLIPs™ Safety Feasibility Study Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With endoluminal stent/device implantation technique treat intracranial aneurysms conjunction embolic coil , neurovascular device place across aneurysm neck , act bridge prevent coil protrude parent artery . Stenting may allow safely achieve high pack density coil . These effect may improve rate complete aneurysm occlusion enhance durability coil treatment . The eCLIPs™ device manufacture Evasc Medical Systems Corp. high density 'leaf ' implant across bifurcation aneurysm neck anchor one branch artery bifurcation may provide improved bifurcation aneurysm treatment allow high pack density embolic coil implant behind eCLIPs™ device eCLIPs™ device combination embolic coil may reduce recurrence/retreatment rate increase rate complete aneurysm occlusion .</detailed_description>
