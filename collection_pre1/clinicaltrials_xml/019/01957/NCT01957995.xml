	<brief_title>Nanosomal Docetaxel Lipid Suspension Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pharmacokinetics profile nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension ( NDLS ) patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety toxicity NDLS patient advance solid tumor . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive low dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour . ARM II : Patients receive low dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension IV 1 hour . ARM III : Patients receive high dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension IV 1 hour . ARM IV : Patients receive high dose nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension IV 1 hour . In arm , treatment may repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
