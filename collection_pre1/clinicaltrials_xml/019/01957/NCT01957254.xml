	<detailed_description>Endotoxin major mediator gram-negative bacteria cause systemic inflammation result microcirculatory dysfunction , lead multiple organ dysfunction death patient severe sepsis septic shock . The goal study measure endotoxin activity patient severe sepsis septic shock certain time point , furthermore , compare difference endotoxin activity among different pathogen , infection source , antibiotic . The study enroll severe sepsis septic shock patient . The endotoxin activity measure Limulus Amebocyte Lysate ( LAL ) test . Limulus Amebocyte Lysate ( LAL ) test use detect quantify serum level endotoxin . The critical component LAL reagent use endotoxin test derive blood cell ( amebocytes ) horseshoe crab , Limulus polyphemus . It contain protein blood clot mechanism , trigger endotoxin . LAL reagent primarily use test endotoxins injectable pharmaceutical , biological product , medical device . They also use renal dialysis center wide range application . LAL test describe Bacterial Endotoxins Test chapter United States Pharmacopeia ( Chapter 85 ) equivalent chapter European Pharmacopoeia ( Chapter 2.6.14 ) Japanese Pharmacopoeia ( Part I , General Tests , No . 6 ) . We adopt chromogenic method purchase Associates Cape Cod Inc. ( ACC ) . The LAL reagent formulate synthetic substrate give yellow color act upon endotoxin activate enzyme . The test read 405 nm , usually microplate reader . The severity multiple organ dysfunction 28-day mortality follow .</detailed_description>
