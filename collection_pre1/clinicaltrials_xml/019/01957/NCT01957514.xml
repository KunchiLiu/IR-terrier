	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish safety feasibility collecting , analyze store clinically annotate panomic data serially monitor subject triple negative breast cancer metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) receive care ten oncology practice across United States . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether molecular change associate resistance treatment identify . II . To understand subject perception regard panomic data application cancer treatment . III . To apply technology characterization subject tumor become available . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection tissue biopsy , blood , buccal mucosa , saliva , urine baseline . After completion study , patient follow 1 day , 7 day , 30 day . Patents follow indefinitely long agree study , depend availability resource .</detailed_description>
