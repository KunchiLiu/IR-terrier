	<detailed_description>This open-label , three-period , fixed-sequence study evaluate drug-drug interaction , pharmacokinetics safety dutasteride tamsulosin administer alone in-combination Chinese healthy male volunteer . The study last approximately eleven week . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis take pre-specified time . Safety assess measurement concurrent medication , change clinical laboratory value , ECG , vital sign , collection adverse events.Approximately 24 healthy adult male enrol approximately 18 subject complete dose critical assessments.This open label , single sequence , three-period study . Approximately 24 healthy male volunteer enrol . At first study period , subject receive 0.5mg dutasteride ( Dut ) single dose ( SD ) feed condition . Serum sample take place pre-dose next 72 hour post dose ( Per . A ) . After 28-30 day washout , subject bring give 0.2mg tamsulosin Harnal D tablet 7 day morning meal . Serum sample pharmacokinetics tamsulosin take place day 1 , day 2 day 3 pre-dose day 4 24 hour ( Per . B ) . On next day ( Day 5 ) , subject give 0.2mg tamsulosin Harnal D tablet 0.5mg dutasteride . Serum sample take place Day 5 pre-dose follow 72 hour ( Per . C ) dutasteride tamsulosin . Subjects participate follow-up visit approximately 2 week last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
