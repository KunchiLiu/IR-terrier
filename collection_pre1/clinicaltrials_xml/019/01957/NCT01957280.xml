	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass PK , safety , tolerability patritumab produce new manufacturing process ( denote `` Process 2 patritumab '' ) . The data study allow Process 2 patritumab compare Process 1 patritumab allow dose adjustment , need , bridge data study previously conduct Process 1 patritumab study conduct Process 2 patritumab . The hypothesis study pharmacokinetics Process 2 patritumab comparable Process 1 patritumab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Pharmacokinetics , Immunogenicity Safety/Tolerability Patritumab ( U3-1287 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Process 2 patritumab administer intravenously single , load dose 18 mg/kg approximately 60 minute Cycle 1 Day 1 follow 9 mg/kg administer every 21 day maintenance dose start Cycle 2 Day 1 . This study conduct 2 phase : main study extension phase . The PK profile Process 2 patritumab compare historical data Process 1 patritumab . Specifically , PK parameter ( AUC0-21d Cmax primary endpoint ) Process 2 patritumab 18 mg/kg ( load dose ) compare PK parameter Process 1 patritumab 18 mg/kg . Process 2 patritumab serum concentration compare Process 1 patritumab serum concentration collect Phase 1 Phase 2 study population PK method report separately .</detailed_description>
