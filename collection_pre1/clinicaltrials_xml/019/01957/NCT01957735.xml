	<detailed_description>This Phase 1a/b multicenter , open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation study examine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) BPM31510 administer 144-hour continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion monotherapy ( treatment Arm 1 ) combination chemotherapy ( treatment Arm 2 ) patient solid tumors.In Phase 1a portion trial , patient meet eligibility parameter receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusion BPM31510 twice weekly Tuesday Friday ( i.e. , Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 18 , 22 25 ) , essentially receive BPM31510 treatment 144 hour per week 28-day cycle . At dose level Arm 1 Arm 2 , patient treat either 8 hour minimum outpatient monitoring inpatient monitor first 24-hrs first infusion Cycle 1.All treatment administer outpatient setting.Dose limit toxicity assess Cycle 1 . The study standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design dose escalate successive cohort 3 6 patient each.Toxicity dose level grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE v4.02 ) . Safety oversight provide Cohort Review Committee ( CRC ) .The CRC review confirm DLTs continue monitor safety throughout study ( include Arm 2 ) . Assessments antitumor activity BPM31510 perform end Cycle 2 every 2 cycle thereafter use standard technique computerize tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) patient measurable disease.Response evaluate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 .Patients experience unacceptable toxicity disease progression , may receive additional 28-day cycle 1 year Arm 1 2 . Patients Arm 1 progress may elect continue BPM31510 treatment combination gemcitabine , 5-FU , docetaxel treat physician 's discretion . Once dose level BPM31510 monotherapy evaluate CRC determines safe escalate next dose level , Cohort 1 Treatment Arm 2 BPM31510 combination chemotherapy open accrual . Cohort 1 Arm 2 patient enrol onto one 3 chemotherapy , gemcitabine , 5-FU , docetaxel . Cycle 1 combination therapy ( Arm 2 ) 6 week duration patient BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesday Friday 6 week chemotherapy administer Mondays , Days 21 , 28 35 . Cycles 2-12 4 week duration BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesday Friday 4 week chemotherapy administer Mondays , Days 7 , 14 21 . Dose limit toxicity assess Cycle 1 . Response assess Cycle 2 ( 10 week ) responder continue onto Cycles 2-12 assess every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . Patients progress crossover Arm 2 reconsented must meet eligibility restart BPM31510 . Crossover patient evaluate DLTs Arm 2 cycle combination therapy 4 week duration ( Cycles 1-12 ) . BPM31510 administer twice weekly Tuesdays Fridays 4 week chemotherapy administer Mondays , Days 7 , 14 21 crossover patient Arm 2 . Patients continue BPM31510 combination chemotherapy maximum 12 cycle absence intolerable toxicity progression . Patients Arm 2 progress one type chemotherapy may switch one chemotherapy agent combination BPM31510.However , chemotherapy component ( ie , 5-FU , gemcitabine , docetaxel ) combination therapy discontinue due chemotherapy-related toxicity , patient may continue receive BPM31510 monotherapy . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) BPM31510 monotherapy combination chemotherapy establish , expansion cohort enrol ( total 12-15 patient monotherapy total 10 patient combination therapy ) .</detailed_description>
