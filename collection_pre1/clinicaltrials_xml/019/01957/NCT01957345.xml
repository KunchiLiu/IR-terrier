	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate standardize method screen platelet signal defect patient constitutional disorder platelet function unknown origin . We hypothesize defect under-diagnosed patient , due heavy workup requirement relatively large blood sample conventional biochemical method . We propose analyse kinase signal downstream platelet membrane receptor use multiplex flow cytometry quantification fluorescent platelet barcoding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little known molecular basis disorder signal pathway potentially responsible constitutional defect platelet function ( adhesion , aggregation secretion ) ( 1-5 ) . Indeed , routine practice , investigation limit complexity analyse use biochemical method ( western blotting ) , requirement large amount platelet . We design new approach quantification platelet cytoplasmic phosphoprotein flow cytometry . Fresh platelet platelet rich plasma analyse baseline stimulation major agonist ( ADP , TRAP , thromboxane analogue , collagen-related peptide ) , without relevant inhibitor pathway . Multiplex barcoding use identify condition , allow high throughput analysis ( 6 , 7 ) . Platelet signal profile Akt , Slp76 , P38 MAPK LIMK obtain blood sample le 10 ml , within 6h The main objective study standardize method clinical laboratory standard expertise flow cytometry . The study perform 4 academic hospital member French reference network rare platelet disease . Three group patient refer mild severe bleeding disorder include : 1 ) control group patient ( 30 per centre ) bleed disorder definitely platelet origin ( e.g . `` low '' von Willebrand ) ; 2 ) group 10 patient per centre definite constitutional platelet disorder ( e.g . Glanzmann thrombasthenia ) 3 ) group 10 patient per centre defect platelet function unknown origin , potentially defective signal pathway . The control group serve standardize method centre establish reference value . A quality control set use frozen platelet preparation . The patient definite platelet disorder useful detect potential signalling defect still describe pathology . Platelet signal defect could evidence group identify conventional biochemical molecular method confirmation new sample . If new approach propose clinical laboratory work rare platelet disease , expect advance knowledge field . In addition method potential pharmaceutical innovation , identify ( 8 ) monitor new antiplatelet agent ( 9 , 10 ) , identify platelet defect induce new `` target therapy '' design disease cancer immune pathology ( 10 ) .</detailed_description>
