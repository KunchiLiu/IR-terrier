	<brief_summary>The purpose study test experimental drug `` THR-18 '' give together drug `` tissue plasminogen activator '' treatment stroke . Tissue plasminogen activator also call `` tPA '' . Strokes often result blockade blood supply cause blood clot form within blood vessel feed brain . Such stroke call `` Ischemic stroke '' . Treatment stroke aim break blood clot ( ) renew blood flow part brain die . Breaking blood clot possible drug tPA inject vein shortly stroke start . However , along break blood clot , tPA sometimes cause adverse effect , example , may cause bleed . THR-18 , drug test study , meant bind tPA reduce adverse effect without stop tPA 's break block blood clot . The primary purpose study evaluate safety THR-18 acute ischemic stroke patient treat parallel tPA . Another purpose study investigate level THR-18 tPA blood stream different time point inject , time , vein . In addition , study measure tPA 's effect blood clot dissolution tPA give without THR-18 . The study also study effect THR-18 may signal brain damage find blood stroke : signal brain damage small protein call S100B matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -9 . These protein release blood stream brain injured . The safety evaluation THR-18 study do comparison placebo . Placebo drug look exactly like THR-18 activity . Three dose THR-18 test , one , three group patient . In group , patient receive THR-18 receive placebo . This clinical study conduct one hospital Ukraine . In total , 30 patient plan participate study . These patient hospital least 3 day receive study treatment . Then , 1 month later , invite last follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
