	<detailed_description>There many biomarkers , angiogenesis factor cytokine , related cancer progression microenvironment interaction . However , commonly use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) require certain volume sample specific antigen antibody . It may practically efficient test broad spectrum biomarkers limit volume serum cancer patient . Proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) , establish concept platform require little sample volume quantitatively detect variety biomarkers , develop multiplex version improve sensitivity dynamic range Stanford group . From three complete trial ( `` In vivo/vitro radiation-induced liver disease HBV carrier（9261700196） '' , `` Bystander effect study radiation-induced viral hepatitis B reactivation（9261700196） '' , `` Pre- post-chemoradiation blood RNA-microarray analysis predict response outcome locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma（200805061R） '' ) one ongoing trial ( `` A phase I dose escalation trial conformal hypofractionated radiation therapy patient hepatitis B virus-related Child A cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma（200906051R） '' ) , collect pre-treatment post-treatment serum sample patient hepatocellular carcinoma undergo definitive radiotherapy patient esophageal cancer undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . Altered pattern failure post-radiotherapy hepatocellular carcinoma , especially intrahepatic extrahepatic metastasis , treatment response post-chemoradiotherapy esophageal cancer upon esophagectomy , demand effective biomarkers early prediction appropriate management . The limited sample volume form obstacle test adequate number biomarkers ELISA . In study plan collaborate Stanford group , send process sample ( 100 μL ) measure dynamic change 56 biomarkers . We try find potential biomarkers correlate treatment response pattern failure future clinical practice , wish set viable PLA platform institute collaboration .</detailed_description>
