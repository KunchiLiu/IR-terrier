	<brief_summary>Hypertensive leg ulcer painful difficult treat ulcer . Their treatment well establish . We want study efficacy PRF application pain related ulcer . PRF ( Platelet-Rich Fibrin ) autologous fibrin clot , obtain extemporaneously patient 's blood , without additive complex manipulation . It contain blood platelet white blood cell , trap fibrin clot formation . PRF ( Platelet-Rich Fibrin ) form immediately blood punction dry tube , contain anticoagulant . Coagulation naturally occur within minute , tube place centrifuge : red blood cell separate fibrin clot thanks difference density , blood platelet white blood cell trap fibrin clot . The fibrin clot rapidly applicated ulcer surface four day . Our hypothesis platelet growth factor cytokine , liberate platelet activation , could help treat hypertensive leg ulcer , cause vascular spasm .</brief_summary>
