	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy cryoablation therapy use treat tumor patient pulmonary metastatic disease . This study enroll patient undergo cryoablation least 1 metastatic pulmonary tumor less equal 3.5cm . Patients follow 24 month post cryoablation procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment pulmonary metastatic disease may include surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , combination treatment . However , several variable may exclude patient treatment multiple tumor , multiple previous surgery , pulmonary dysfunction , co-morbid medical condition . For patient , percutaneous cryoablation may suitable option . Ablation metastatic lung tumor rapidly expand area within interventional oncology . Cryotherapy , radiofrequency , laser microwave show effective . Cryotherapy offer wide range anatomic tumor treatment option ability visualize ice image guidance preservation collagenous tissue structure . Cryoablation extensively perform prostate kidney favorable outcomes reported literature . More recently , cryoablation show safe treatment lung tumor CT guidance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must least 18 year old . Patient sign write informed consent . Patient present Stage 4 pulmonary metastatic disease metastatic disease previously confirm prior biopsy ; Patient present Stage 4 pulmonary metastatic disease previously confirm imaging ( e.g . computerize tomography CT ) histology proven primary cancer . Patient 6 local pulmonary metastasis targetable cryoablation . Targeted index tumor ( ) define intra pulmonary pleural maximum size 3.5 cm , measure long cross sectional dimension . The target index tumor ( ) determine ( CT image ) location cryoablation technically achievable base proximity adjacent organs/ structure great 0.5 cm critical organ/structure ( possibly achieve additional maneuver iatrogenic pneumothorax hydrodissection ) . Karnofsky Performance Scale ( KPS ) score great equal 60 . Platelet count great 50,000/mm3 within 8 week prior initial cryoablation procedure . International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) less 1.5 within 8 week prior initial cryoablation procedure . Patient life expectancy great 3 month . Patient 's index tumor ( ) primary lung cancer . Patient uncontrollable primary metastatic disease outside lung . Patient unable lie flat respiratory distress rest . Patient coagulopathy bleed disorder uncontrolled . Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &lt; 1000 within 8 week prior initial cryoablation procedure . Patient evidence active systemic , pulmonary , pericardial infection . Patient debilitate medical psychiatric illness would preclude give informed consent receive optimal treatment follow . Patient currently participate experimental study could affect primary endpoint ( e.g . experimental chemotherapy regimen ) .</criteria>
