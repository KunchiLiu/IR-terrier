	<brief_summary>Emergence hypertension common occurrence patient emerge general anesthesia . This elevation arterial pressure particularly concern patient undergo craniotomy due increase risk morbidity mortality patient alter intracranial elastance . Thus , identify good method attenuate hemodynamic change associate emergence anesthesia improve patient safety , especially neurosurgical patient . Study Hypothesis : Nicardipine effective esmolol sole agent maintain blood pressure within goal range set emergence hypertension craniotomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicardipine v Esmolol Craniotomy Emergence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emergence hypertension follow craniotomy well-described , albeit poorly understood , phenomenon . Strict control blood pressure utmost importance neurosurgical procedure ; failure prevent acute rise arterial blood pressure place patient increase risk intracranial bleeding , cerebral edema , increase intracranial pressure , prolong hospital stay . Emergence hypertension craniotomy seem result acute transient increase catecholamine release , peripheral vasoconstriction , reduce baroreceptor sensitivity . Prior investigation demonstrate treatment antihypertensive agent require 60 90 % neurosurgical patient postoperatively . Given common occurrence emergence hypertension craniotomy increase risk potentially devastating event may occur set acute increase arterial blood pressure , important identify best manage hemodynamic change . An ideal drug management emergence hypertension would short-acting , parenteral drug easily rapidly titratable . Medications commonly utilized include nicardipine , labetolol , esmolol . When give bolus , nicardipine , calcium channel blocker , demonstrate maximal response &lt; 2 minute mean half-life approximately 40 minute . Nicardipine also frequently administer infusion ; however , time onset increase bolus administer duration action may 4-6 hour prolonged infusion . Labetolol , non-selective beta-blocker , demonstrate onset 10-20 second peak activity 5 minute . Esmolol ultra-short-acting , B1-beta-blocker rapid onset quickly metabolize nonspecific red blood cell esterases ; however , esmolol primarily result decrease heart rate demonstrate less effect blood pressure .</detailed_description>
