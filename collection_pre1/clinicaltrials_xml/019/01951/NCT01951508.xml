	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effect methylphenidate , modafinil , 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` Ecstasy '' ) emotion-processing cognitive performance use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technique . The primary hypothesis psychostimulants differentially affect process emotional stimulus potentially lead alteration social cognition behavior .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Methylphenidate , Modafinil , MDMA Emotion-processing Humans : A Pharmaco-fMRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methylphenidate modafinil increasingly use performance enhancer `` smart drug '' student . 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` Ecstasy '' ) widely use recreational drug enhance emotion . We plan investigate effect psychostimulants emotion-processing cognitive performance use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technique . Single dose methylphenidate ( 60mg ) , modafinil ( 600mg ) , MDMA ( 125mg ) , placebo administer fMRI scan placebo-controlled , randomize cross-over study design 24 healthy subject . Subjective emotional effect , sociability , neurohormonal , cardiovascular response , plasma drug concentration also assess analyzed potential brain-induced change brain activity network process emotion . The primary hypothesis psychostimulants differentially affect process emotional stimulus potentially lead alteration social cognition behavior . The work clarify neuropharmacological basis potentially differential effect drug . This information improve understanding neurofunctional effect methylphenidate , modafinil , MDMA , inform ongoing debate surround brain dope cognitive mood enhancer .</detailed_description>
