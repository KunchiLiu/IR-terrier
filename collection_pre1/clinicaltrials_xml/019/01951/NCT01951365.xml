	<brief_summary>Spinal intradural schwannoma detect incidentally increase recently . Because little knowledge natural history spinal schwannoma , consensus treatment . Our hypothesis follow ; 1 . Some schwannomas keep growing , others . 2 . Foraminal schwannomas usually grow . The investigator analyze natural history characteristic 56 spinal schwannomas observe initially accurate reliable method . Here investigator display grow pattern differential point spinal schwannoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design participants The investigator include patient diagnose spinal IDEM schwannoma MR imaging check follow-up MR image undergoing surgical resection ( include radiosurgery ) . The patient usually check follow-up MR image annually biannually . The patient underwent surgical resection surveillance interval also enrol . Exclusion criterion study follow : 1 ) surgical resection diagnosis ; 2 ) von Recklinghausen ' disease ( neurofibromatosis ) ; 3 ) recur residual tumor . For patient lose follow-up , investigator check whether patient underwent surgery telephone obtain recent radiologic study possible . Medical record radiologic study enrol patient evaluated patient demographic , tumor level , main location ( intracanal foraminal ) , shape ( globus , rugby ball , dumbbell ) , date diagnosis , follow-up date check follow-up MR imaging , length follow-up . These serial study compare tumor growth evaluate correlation . Tumor volume measurement growth The investigator measure tumor volume volume quantification method use Leksell Gamma Plan® system ( version , 10.1.1 . Elekta Instrument AB , Stockholm , Sweden ) Figure 1 . It calculate tumor volume summation cylindrical mass image advantage measure best accuracy especially non-globus tumor.6 The process measure tumor volume rigorously design minimize observer subjectivity . Stack image without gap load program . The investigator draw tumor outline manually select plane orthogonal view . The program measure tumor volume use algorithm base scatter data interpolation radial basis function . All tumor volume measure independently two observer . Interobserver reliability assess Brand-Altman plot . The plot apply look trend data produce similar result evaluate agreement two observers.7 Under confidence excellent interobserver agreement mark , investigator finally estimate tumor volume mean value two measure data . Volumetric growth rate ( VGR ) tumor calculate volume change baseline volume present percent . Overall VGR ( % ) calculate use follow formula : ( Final volume-Baseline volume ) x100/Baseline volume . Annual VGR ( % ) calculate follow ; Annual VGR ( % ) = ( Final vol.-Baseline vol . ) / ( Baseline vol . ) *FU duration ( day ) *12/365*100 FU vol . mean follow-up volume , respectively . There consensus definition amount tumor growth . A prior study report cut-off value growth rate vestibular schwannoma extend cerebello-pontine angle 10.4 % . The investigator set 10 % increase VGR cut-off value . The investigator make two standard , 10 % increase overall annual VGR , evaluate validity receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve . Enrolled patient divide two group standard . The first group , grow tumor , define mean ≥10 % increase tumor volume . The group , stable tumor , define mean &lt; 10 % increase , stationary , decrease tumor volume . Statistical analysis The investigator use Brand-Altman plot interobserver reliability . The investigator use ROC analysis compare predictive validity standard overall VGR annual VGR , find optimal cut-off value annual VGR grow schwannomas . Because area curve measure diagnostic power test , large one choose standard divide grow versus stable tumor . ROC curve plot use measure sensitivity specificity base various cut-off value . Cut-off value select value closer upper leave corner . For comparative analysis grow stable tumor group , independent test continuous variable , Fisher 's exact test , chi-square test use . The significance level set p &lt; 0.05 . The investigator use MedCalc Statistical Software version 12.7.2 ( MedCalc Software bvba , Ostend , Belgium ) Bland-Altman plot SPSS statistical package ( Version 20.0 ; SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) data analysis .</detailed_description>
