	<brief_summary>The goal study examine whether sitagliptin , agent enhances action hormone control release insulin already clinical use type 2 diabetes , might also improve functional exercise capacity . Specific aim : 1 . To test whether sitagliptin improve functional exercise capacity person type 2 diabetes compare glimepiride . 1a . The primary outcome peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) oxygen uptake kinetics ( VO2 kinetics ) . 1b . Secondary outcome include cardiac function , endothelial function tissue oxygen saturation ( STO2 ) well health-related quality life . 2 . To evaluate impact sitagliptin muscle mitochondrial function 2a . The primary outcome address aim 31P measurement ( phosphocreatine , free inorganic phosphate , adenosine triphosphate peak , adenosine diphosphate pH ) Impact : Novel approach need decrease excess cardiovascular morbidity mortality diabetes . Diabetes impairs cardiovascular fitness thereby mortality . A demonstration sitagliptin improve cardiovascular fitness , ( possibly mitochondrial function ) provide important new data pertinent management diabetes pre-diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects come total nine test visit evaluation take place . Visits structure follow : 1 . After subject review study give consent study participation , history physical exam perform . Ankle brachial index , autonomic nervous system function test , Low-level Physical Activity Recall questionnaire vital sign perform . 2 . Blood drawn measurement hemoglobin A1C , fast glucose , fast insulin , free fatty acid microalbuminuria , c-reactive protein , interleukin 6 , adiponectin , creatinine glycerol . Additional screen labs include complete blood count ( CBC ) , follicle-stimulating hormone , urine protein lipid panel ass whether woman pre- post-menopausal ( FSH ) , overall health ( CBC , lipids urine protein ) . A dietary survey administer food preference three day study diet administer prior visit 3-5 7-9 . Dual-energy xray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) body composition test do ensure group weight similar ( use fat-free mass ) . A pulmonary function test , rest electrocardiogram ( EKG ) familiarization bicycle test perform . 3 . Subjects receive three day study diet prior visit 3 . A resting exercise EKG perform day visit . A graded exercise test do determine VO2peak . Patients measure cardiac function endothelial function visit 3 plethysmography cardiac echo . Vital sign take rest . 4 . Subjects receive three day study diet prior visit 4 . Calf muscle magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) perform 3.0 T whole-body MRI scanner . 5 . During visit 5 , arterial stiffness/endothelial function non-invasively measure Sphygmocor system . Subjects also three constant-load test measure VO2 kinetics oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) measure exercise . A resting exercise EKG vital sign perform visit . Subjects randomize take sitagliptin plus placebo glimepiride plus placebo must take metformin ( 1-2 gram /d ) 3 month . Sitagliptin placebo administer 100 mg/d . Glimepiride placebo administer 2 mg/day . During treatment phase subject give log keep track blood glucose day . 6 . Visit 6 consist physical exam clinician well blood draw check vital sign sitagliptin glimepiride treatment . 7 . After 3 month sitagliptin glimepiride administration , Visit 3 repeat . Additional testing perform visit 7 include physical exam perform study physician , blood work covariate lab test list Visit 2 Low-level Physical Activity Recall ( LoPAR ) questionnaire . 8 . During visit 8 , visit 4 procedure repeat . 9 . During visit 9 , test perform visit 5 repeat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Female subject may pre , peri postmenopausal . 2 . People participate regular exercise program ( &gt; one bout exercise per week ) . 3 . Presence type 2 diabetes document chart review confirm diagnosis well presence treatment diabetes . 4 . Persons type 2 diabetes accept study total glycosylated hemoglobin level ( HbA1C ) 7 9.5 % ( adequate control ) therapy . 5 . Persons take metformin 5002000 mg/day control T2D , take diabetes medication addition instead metformin . 6 . Persons take medication control diabetes . 1 . Females childbearing potential pregnant , plan become pregnant breastfeeding . 2 . Persons exclude evidence ischemic heart disease history abnormal resting exercise electrocardiogram ( EKG ) ( &gt; 1 mm ST segment depression ) , regional wall motion abnormality , leave ventricular systolic dysfunction significant valvular disease . 3 . Persons angina cardiac pulmonary symptom potentially limit exercise performance . 4 . Presence systolic blood pressure &gt; 190 rest &gt; 250 exercise diastolic pressure &gt; 95 rest &gt; 115 exercise . 5 . Subjects peripheral arterial disease . 6 . Subjects proteinuria ( urine protein &gt; 200 mg/dl ) creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl , suggestive renal disease . 7 . Persons liver function impairment define elevate liver function test three time upper limit . 8 . Persons history pancreatitis . 9 . Subjects 140 % ideal body weight . 10 . Patients insulin therapy include . 11 . Current smoker accept study since smoke impair cardiovascular exercise performance people quit smoke least 1year accepted study . 12 . Persons autonomic dysfunction ( &gt; 20 mm fall upright blood pressure without change heart rate ) exclude . 13 . Diabetic person clinically evident distal symmetrical neuropathy exclude study , possible effect exercise performance , evaluation symptom ( numbness , paresthesia ) sign ( elicit vibration , pinprick , light touch , ankle jerk ) . 14 . Persons diabetic ketoacidosis . 15 . Persons serious hypersensitivity sitagliptin , sulfonylureas sulfonamide . 16 . Inability walk ride bike unassisted continuous 5 minute . 17 . Subjects exclude implanted metal body . 18 . Subjects currently treat Digoxin .</criteria>
