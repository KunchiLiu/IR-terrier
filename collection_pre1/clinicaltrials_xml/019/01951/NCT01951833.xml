	<brief_summary>The current dream CF research discover safe drug correct basic defect prevent lung disease , allow patient without significant lung damage live nearly normal life dramatic increase life expectancy without burden current treatment . The compound VX-770 ( Ivacaftor Ã’ ) hop first milestone along way . Progression lung disease gradual many centre sensitive indicator early lung disease ( small airway disease ) critically need ass effect new treatment . In context , assessment ventilation inhomogeneity measurement call Lung clearance index ( LCI ) seem promising tool . However , get approval health authority , new measure use drug evaluation need fulfill strict criterion . For LCI , investigator still need prove long term significance : How well LCI measurement predict long term lung disease course ? Therefore , study investigator want measure LCI baseline large patient cohort establish well predict patient ' disease course next 2 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long Term Significance ( Survival ) LCI Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients CF ( 6 year old FEV1 40 % predict ) invite participate prospective non interventional study 2 CF center ( UCL UZ Leuven ) . Jointly take care 40 % Belgian CF population . Median FEV1 child ( 6 - &lt; 18 , n &gt; 120 ) CTN center high ( around 100 % pred ) , define study group great interest current context . To assess predictive value LCI 2 year , time next pulmonary exacerbation evaluate entire cohort . To assess predictive value LCI 2 year , time next pulmonary exacerbation evaluate entire cohort . Repeat LCI measurement do subsequent patient visit . 2 device measure LCI test compare : Ecomedics NDD . LCI spirometry measure 120 healthy Belgian child young adult . These subject must free respiratory symptom least two week chronic recurrent chest problem .</detailed_description>
