	<brief_summary>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) hormone produce intestine . It release immediately meal ingestion increase insulin release . This , turn , help reduce blood glucose level . This circuit work properly human type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . We previously show peptide call xenin-25 amplify effect GIP insulin secretion human . However , xenin-25 long human develop T2DM . Thus , important understand xenin-25 work human without T2DM know work human T2DM . Acetylcholine molecule produce specific type nerve . The effect acetylcholine block drug call atropine . We previously show mice atropine prevents ability xenin-25 increase effect GIP insulin release . The purpose clinical trial determine atropine also block effect xenin-25 human without T2DM . If , impair acetylcholine signaling may one reason humans develop T2DM could possible develop drug bypass defect increase insulin release human T2DM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) hormone produce intestine . It release immediately meal ingestion increase insulin release .

If , impair acetylcholine signaling may one reason humans develop T2DM may possible develop drug bypass defect increase insulin release human T2DM . To conduct study , enroll human pre-diabetes since respond well xenin-25 . Potential subject first check see pre-diabetes also verify safely participate study . Once enrol , subject come 8 different visit , separate 3 week . On visit , subject give intravenous infusion glucose blood glucose level slowly increase 4 hour period . On separate occasion , participant also receive infusion GIP alone , xenin-25 alone , GIP plus xenin-25 , placebo . Each 4 infusion conduct without infusion atropine ( thus- 8 visit ) . Blood glucose insulin level , well host hormone , measure study visit . A comparison result tell u effect xenin-25 insulin release mediate acetylcholine human .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals must able consent participation ( mental impairment affect cognition willingness follow study instruction ) . Otherwise healthy volunteer borderline diabetes impair glucose tolerance . Women childbearing potential must currently taking/using acceptable method birth control . A pregnancy test do begin visit . Any woman positive pregnancy test remove study . Willingness complete require visit . Lacks cognitive ability sign consent follow study direction . Women unwilling use acceptable method contraception course study , currently breastfeed . Volunteers history Acute Pancreatitis . Volunteers history cancer ( except skin cancer ) . Volunteer history Chronic Pancreatitis and/or risk factor chronic pancreatitis include hypertriglyceridemia , hypercalcemia and/or presence gallstone .
