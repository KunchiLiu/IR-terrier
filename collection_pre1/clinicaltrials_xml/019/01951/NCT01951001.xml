	<detailed_description>The combination clopidogrel aspirin mainstay treatment strategy prevent ischemic event wide spectrum patient high-risk coronary artery disease . Multiple line evidence demonstrate patient poor responder high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity ( HPR ) adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) increase risk post-percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ischemic event occurrence . A consensus paper suggest cutoff HPR determine various platelet function test use personalized antiplatelet therapy . In addition , several clinical study report patient low on-treatment platelet reactivity ( LPR ) relate increase risk serious bleed follow PCI . Although multiple coronary risk factor influence response clopidogrel , cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2C19 loss-of-function allele major component determine level platelet reactivity prevalence HPR clopidogrel treatment . There multiple CYP2C19 allele associate loss-of-function ( *2-*8 ) , interethnic difference loss-of-function allele carriage exist ( Table 1 ) .4 Approximately 30 % Caucasians CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carrier vast majority carry *2 allele . However , ~ 65 % East Asians carry CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele ; ~50 % carry *2 allele rest carry *3 allele . Furthermore , influence CYP2C19*3 allele antiplatelet response clopidogrel seem great compare CYP2C19*2 allele.6 It suggest high prevalence CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele carriage East Asians may explain high prevalence HPR clopidogrel treatment ( least 40 % standard-dose administration ) . However , despite high prevalence HPR , numerous prospective clinical study registry data show East Asians similar even low rate post-PCI ischemic event occurrence clopidogrel therapy compare Caucasians- `` East Asian paradox '' . Intriguingly , study PCI-treated East Asians report high HPR cutoff compare HPR cutoff obtain Western population ( 252.5-288 vs. 208-235 P2Y12 reaction unit [ PRU ] VerifyNow P2Y12 assay ) . The level relative contribution HPR post-stenting ischemic event occurrence East Asians may differ Western population . Even though East Asians show low level platelet inhibition clopidogrel treatment , accompany risk post-PCI serious bleed East Asians high compare race CHSRISMA ( Clopidogrel High Atherothrombotic Risk Ischemic Stabilization , Management , Avoidance ) study.16 Moreover , suggest cutoff LPR PCI-treated Koreans appear high compare Caucasians ( e.g . VASP-P index 30 % vs. 17 % ) . Taken together , East Asians may intrinsically reduce risk arterial thrombosis lead increase therapeutic zone platelet reactivity ADP compare Caucasians ( increased cutoff LPR HPR ) . # Are ethnic difference thrombogenecity ? Arterial thrombosis platelet rich superimpose rupture inflamed atherosclerotic lesions.18 However , experimental study suggest arterial venous thrombosis finely regulate process involve highly complex interplay platelet blood cell , soluble plasma protein , vessel wall.18,19 The convincing association arterial thrombosis coagulation system inflammation repeatedly demonstrate multiple clinical trial : fibrinogen , factor V Leiden ( G1691A ) prothrombin G20210A gene mutation , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . To date , definite evidence suggest difference intrinsic platelet function exist race . However , numerous data suggest inter-ethnic difference coagulation , fibrinolytic activity , inflammation . Several population-based clinical trial report different incidence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) across races.23,24 In study , patient Asian descent appear low rate VTE race . Prevalence arterial thrombosis also show increase black race compare non-black race . This disparity race partially explain genetic risk factors.24 In Multi-ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) study evaluate multiple hemostatic factor plasma endothelial activation marker individual live USA , African Americans generally thrombogenic dysfunctional endothelial profile , follow Hispanics Caucasians similar level , finally East Asians . A grow body evidence demonstrate different level inflammation race , East Asians appear low level inflammation . In summary , East Asians appear less prothrombotic state compare African Americans Caucasians . The latter observation may explain East Asian population low risk ischemic event occurrence high propensity bleed clopidogrel treatment PCI . # Future direction `` ethnicity/phenotype-based antiplatelet therapy '' Two large-scale , prospective clinical trial ( Trial Assess Improvement Therapeutic Outcomes Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel-TIMI 38 [ TRITON-TIMI 38 ] PLATelet Inhibition Patient Outcomes [ PLATO ] ) 30,31 evaluate clinical efficacy safety potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor ( prasugrel ticagrelor ) ACS patient demonstrate superiority strong platelet inhibition prevent occurrence ischemic event compare clopidogrel treatment . However , recent `` real world '' clinical data Western population show ACS patient LPR ( 30 % total cohort ) increase risk serious bleeding ( e.g . 15.5 % TIMI minor plus major bleed 1-year prasugrel treatment ) . In era potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor , concept LPR overcome risk bleeding may emerge target field platelet research . Because PLATO TRITON TIMI-38 enrol limited number Asians ( ~3 % total cohort ) , difficult draw reliable conclusion regard whether potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor provide similar benefit East Asians compare race . Aforementioned , East Asians may intrinsically reduce risk arterial thrombosis lead increase therapeutic zone platelet reactivity compare Caucasians . Like cardiovascular drug , mark interethnic difference pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics prasugrel exist . Exposure active metabolite platelet inhibition prasugrel treatment high East Asians include Chinese , Japanese , Korean population compare Caucasians even adjustment body weight . In recent pharmacodynamic study include stented Koreans , 10 mg/d prasugrel achieve low level PRU compare 5 mg/d prasugrel 75 mg/d clopidogrel ( 80.1 ± 45.9 vs.163.1 ± 61.2 vs. 214.0 ± 69.1 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . About two third 10 mg/d prasugrel group meet criterion LPR ( ≤ 94 PRU ) , support 10 mg/d prasugrel strong increase risk serious bleed East Asians . Taken together , optimal dosage antiplatelet regimens inhibitory level target pathway may differ race . In East Asians less thrombogenicity , excessive inhibition platelet function potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor may markedly increase risk serious bleed without protection post-PCI ischemic event occurrence . Therefore , dedicated investigation East Asians require apply Western recommendation novel antiplatelet therapy former population . It time consider paradigm shift `` one size fit '' `` ethnicity/phenotype-based antiplatelet therapy '' . We design A-MATCH study cover unmet need guarantee clinical efficacy safety East Asians less thrombogenicity .</detailed_description>
