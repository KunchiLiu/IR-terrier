	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Garamycin® Sponge ( Gentamicin-Collagen Sponge ) Diabetic Patients With Moderate Severe Foot Ulcer Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infected skin ulcer diabetes debilitate difficult heal . Diabetic ulcer responsible frequent health care visit , major predictor amputation . Diabetic ulcer cause patient 's inability sense pain warmth well peripheral vascular disease , cause diminished blood flow foot . Early aggressive treatment necessary treat infection ultimately prevent need amputation . Gentamicin antibiotic effective treat certain kind infection . Collagen protein find mammal . The gentamicin sponge use study commercially available Switzerland Garamycin® Sponge . The Garamycin Sponge thin flat sponge make collagen come bovine tendon contain gentamicin . When applied open ulcer , collagen break gentamicin release ulcer , little absorbed blood stream . The high level gentamicin open infect ulcer may help treat infection . All subject give necessary supply teach take care foot ulcer . All subject also receive oral antibiotic . Additionally , subject randomly assign receive gentamicin-collagen sponge place gentamicin-collagen sponge ulcer daily wound care .</detailed_description>
