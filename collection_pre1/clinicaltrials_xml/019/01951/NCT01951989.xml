	<brief_summary>Rational : Imiglucerase use treat Gaucher disease since 1997 data pharmacokinetics partial ; investigator know imiglucerase undergoes quick clearance plasma compartment follow infusion ( 1/2 life : 1-6 min , tissue : &lt; 24h ) , observation apparently contradictory usual infusion rhythm ( one infusion every two week ) . Furthermore , go GD response , rhythm Infusion sometimes diminish ( example , every 3 4 wks ) without pharmacological rational ; In parallel , investigator demonstrate monocyte represent satisfactory surrogate GD target cell enzyme activity monocytes varies individual . Our hypothesis enzyme activity monocyte compartment could different could relate GD response . Primary purpose : evaluate pharmacokinetics Imiglucerase activity target cellular compartment depend dose frequency infusion . Secondary purpose : 1 ) establish possible relationship intra-monocytic activity glucocerebrosidase clinical biological activity Gaucher disease define possible threshold value enzyme activity ; 2 ) establish good correlation know biomarkers disease ( routine marker marker recently identify ) , would better predict / monitor response treatment ; 3 ) compare residual natural rate activity enzyme intra-monocytic untreated patient ( low severity disease ) .</brief_summary>
