	<brief_title>Validation Community Survey Methodology Measuring PMTCT Program Impact</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overarch aim study determine accuracy reliability household survey methodology measure PMTCT program impact . If appropriately validate , approach could use monitor program effectiveness across wide range setting , part Demographic Health Surveys ( DHS ) stand-alone evaluation . Specific objective Objective 1 : To validate community survey methodology measure PMTCT program effectiveness . Across 42 community rural Lusaka Province , estimate HIV-free survival among HIV-exposed child use two methodology community level : survey approach `` gold standard '' cohort approach . Hypothesis : HIV-free survival measurement two study component demonstrate strong correlation high inter-method agreement , thus confirm validity community survey PMTCT evaluation . Objective 2 : To identify individual- facility-level characteristic associate HIV-free survival among HIV-exposed infant . We determine key characteristic associate optimal PMTCT program effectiveness , thus provide objective measurement `` best practice '' set . Hypothesis : High PMTCT service utilization high antenatal care quality emerge important predictor HIV-free survival . METHODOLOGY We propose validate use cross-sectional community survey estimate PMTCT program effectiveness predominately rural African setting . The unit measurement community level , obtain HIV-free survival estimate use two approach . Estimates community survey compare gold standard community cohort , statistical correlation inter-method agreement determine . This study implement within context Better Health Outcomes Mentoring Assessment ( BHOMA ) evaluation , conduct locally Zambia AIDS Related Tuberculosis ( TB ) Project ( ZAMBART ) collaborate partner ( University Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee ( UNZA BREC ) Ref # 004-12-08 ) . The roll-out BHOMA service occur staggered fashion across 42 48 health facility Chongwe ( n=21 ) , Kafue ( n=14 ) , Luangwa Districts ( n=7 ) . The community survey evaluation community outreach component BHOMA target surround catchment area health facility . Excluded evaluation hospital , typically receive referral across district , military health post . Community survey component We work integrate PMTCT survey methodology ongoing BHOMA evaluation activity . In round , individual survey use stratified cluster sampling , catchment area serve stratum . Within stratum , geographically define grid square randomly sample . All household select grid square visit survey team , comprise minimum trained research assistant clinician . All individual household enumerate use personal digital assistant uploaded standard enumeration form . The household location log use Global Positioning System ( GPS ) coordinate , confirm position within grid square . Enumerated adults present home ask provide write informed consent participate survey . Older child adolescent provide assent ; young child infant require consent parent guardian . Three questionnaire develop implement : household , men 's , woman 's questionnaire . All adapted standard Demographic Health Survey Sexual Behavior Survey use Zambia decade . The household questionnaire complete head household ; men 's woman 's questionnaire administer adult men woman , respectively , home time visit . In addition , data collect participant weight , height , abdominal circumference ; hypertension screening provide use digital sphygmomanometer ; voluntary counseling test HIV offer use sequential test algorithm endorse Zambian Ministry Health . HIV result available field disclose participant willing learn HIV status . Post-test counseling provide certified provider household appropriate referral make . In component , implement PMTCT evaluation module target woman report live birth past 24 month within BHOMA survey . Although HIV test offer adult part main BHOMA survey , also collect dry blood spot ( DBS ) specimens mother infant link use pre-printed bar code . For mother refuse real-time testing , agree collection maternal DBS specimen , provide card unique study-generated identification number use pick-up result ( appropriate post-test counseling ) community 's designate health facility . For agreed on-site HIV testing , retain DBS specimens quality assurance purpose . On regular basis , randomly select anonymized specimen analyze use ELISA HIV antibody test . If high level discordancy on-site rapid test lab-based ELISA HIV test observe , test specimen confirm maternal HIV status . As part inform consent process , participant also ask whether leftover specimen may use future use , pending local international ethical approval specify substudies . If household report delivery within past 24 month , mother die , collect much relevant antenatal , delivery , postpartum information possible guardian caretaker . An abbreviated verbal autopsy instrument administer determine whether cause death may HIV-related . If infant still alive , collect DBS specimen via heelstick HIV antibody test possibly HIV DNA PCR . If infant die , document include study event . Specimens HIV-exposed infant &lt; 18 month test HIV infection use HIV DNA PCR . For agree time inform consent , dispatch train lay counselor household discuss HIV test result , provide post-test counseling , make necessary clinic referral , include long-term HIV care treatment . Community cohort component To calculate `` gold standard '' estimate 18-month HIV-free survival , enroll follow cohort HIV-exposed child ( HIV-infected mother ) 18 month . To minimize selection bias may result facility-based recruitment , enroll within catchment area surround health facility . In community , identify train community-based research assistant ( CRAs ) recruit participant community cohort . To ensure continuity government health system , possible , individual preferentially recruit Neighborhood Health Committees facility . We use facility- community-based reporting system BHOMA identify recent birth , within first 4 week life , approach mother home explain study . Interested candidate ask show write documentation HIV status , preferably take-home antenatal record . For without documentation , obtain consent HIV screen provide test on-site use Ministry Health-approved algorithm . Those test HIV-negative provide routine post-test counseling refer near health facility routine postpartum care . Women test HIV-positive documented HIV infection antenatal care study explain ask provide write informed consent infant participate . At initial enrollment , questionnaire administer , include demographic socioeconomic characteristic , basic medical history , recent obstetrical history , detailed question regard HIV , include PMTCT service utilization last pregnancy . Where possible , incorporate question verbatim PMTCT evaluation module community survey , ensure comparability two population . A DBS specimen collect infant HIV DNA PCR test . Following enrollment , three additional household visit plan : 6 week , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month . CRAs complete short questionnaire focus ongoing PMTCT intervention child health ( include morbidity mortality ) . If available , review Under-5 Card , take-home medical record child less 5 year age , detail child 's medical course . At 6 week , 6 month , 12 month , DBS specimens collect via heelstick HIV DNA PCR test . At 18 month , rapid antibody test perform site . Test result return mother site choosing , either home health facility , train counselor . Children test HIV-positive refer near health facility confirmation diagnosis long-term care . Facility survey component Study staff complete detail facility survey questionnaires 42 facility . They administer modify version `` A Rapid Health Facility Assessment Tool : Enhance Quality Access Primary Health Care Level '' . The instrument comprise four module : quality-of-care checklist complete direct observation first antenatal visit ( Module 1 ) ; exit interview six consecutive pregnant woman measure knowledge perception clinical care ( Module 2 ) ; checklist available supply infrastructure site ( Module 3 ) ; interview facility manager regard service provide , staff level , facility descriptor ( Module 4 ) . In addition , time-motion component record wait time registration patient encounter , duration total visit , duration post-test counseling . Prior implementation , field-test survey instrument focus group refine need . Based limitation identify previous analysis , expect increase number directly observe patient encounter six 15-20 individual standardize type visit encounter . We may also consider completion facility survey multiple site visit , response single clinic visit give undue weight . All data enter Microsoft Access database seven facility performance score - , base previous PEARL study - calculate base priori grouping characteristic : antenatal care , PMTCT , supply , staff level , patient satisfaction , general infrastructure , patient understanding medication . Both individual characteristic composite score compare outcome HIV-free survival .</detailed_description>
