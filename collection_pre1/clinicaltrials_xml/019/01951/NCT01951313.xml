	<detailed_description>The 2010 Dietary Guidelines Americans emphasize consumption 4.5 cup fruit vegetable daily . However , average fruit vegetable intake US adult 2.6 cup . This low consumption fruit vegetable may result limited availability fat soluble , health-promoting , phytochemical carotenoids food . Dietary carotenoid beneficial biological property include antioxidant anti-inflammatory effect scientific research support protective effect carotenoids many degenerative disease , include cardiovascular disease , age-related macular degeneration , type cancer . Therefore , either low intake inefficient bioavailability carotenoid fruit vegetable may reduce potential effectiveness disease preventative compound . The bioavailability carotenoid meal affect several factor , include food matrix , type food processing cooking , interaction dietary compound digestion absorption , gut status may affect digestion absorption process , nutritional status . Co-consumption carotenoid rich food dietary lipid may one effective stimulators carotenoid absorption among factor influence bioaccessibility bioavailability . Eggs know highly bioavailable source carotenoid , presumably due presence lipid phospholipid egg yolk . The highly bioavailable nature carotenoid egg suggest egg derive factor may leverage improve bioavailability carotenoid find co-consumed fruit vegetable . While promise , limited data exist impact co-consumed food source lipid , egg , enhance carotenoid absorption . This study design assess beneficial effect egg consumption carotenoid absorption complex meal , beyond find egg .</detailed_description>
