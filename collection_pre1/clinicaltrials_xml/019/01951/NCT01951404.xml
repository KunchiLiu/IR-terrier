	<brief_summary>Kidney patient dialysis commonly die heart disease . One big problem heart muscle wall heart thickens . This make less efficient . We find patient mild kidney disease drug normally use treat gout ( allopurinol ) remarkable side effect able reduce thicken heart wall . In new study aim find benefit allopurinol also occur severe kidney patient i.e . regular dialysis . We also try figure best dose allopurinol use . To plan study recruit patient kidney disease dialysis . The 1st phase trial determine best dose allopurinol use second phase clinical trial patient randomly allocate either optimum dose allopurinol dummy medication ( placebo ) receive one year treatment . They special scan heart use MRI machine measure extent thicken heart muscle start treatment MRI scan one year treatment finish . Phase 1- dose find study , involve 10 patient 3 7 visit hospital schedule around 4 17 dialysis session . The late study involve 76 patient ask attend hospital 8 time 13 month period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does ALlopurinol Regress lefT Ventricular Hypertrophy End Stage REnal Disease : The ALTERED Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ALTERED trial randomise , double blind , placebo control multi-centre study conduct NHS Tayside , NHS Ayrshire &amp; Arran &amp; NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde compare allopurinol ( dose confirm dose escalation study note ) either , 100mg , 200mg , 250mg , 300mg 350mg placebo . Patients enrol trial period 12 13 month . At screen visit initial history clinical examination perform . Participants undergo echocardiogram ensure significant heart failure unless ECHO previous 4 years..Should participant eligible study Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan prior baseline ( Randomisation ) visit . They also blood take safety analysis , 12 lead ECG do , vital sign record agree 24 hour BP monitoring . Once patient know eligible return - first randomisation , dose visit time four week screen . At randomisation visit post dialysis session , eligible participant randomly assign either placebo allopurinol 100mg . They continue allopurinol/placebo 100mg 2 week , dose dialysis session . They FMD , PWV PWA measurements take . All participant offer opportunity opt FMD , PWV PWA measurement , secondary outcome measure . If study drug tolerate , dose would increase weekly interval 200mg dose allopurinol dose choose dose escalation study , great 200mg . Baseline blood sample take routine blood include full blood count , renal function , liver function , random blood glucose , haemoglobin A1C , lipid , calcium phosphate . These blood test repeat 6 , 9 12 month . Routine safety blood ( include U+Es LFTs ) take pre-dialysis visit throughout study . Subjects follow baseline , week 2 , week 6 , month 6 , month 9 month 12 . Research blood urate level take baseline , week 6 , month 6 , 9 12 . However , ensure blind throughout urate result make available investigator end trial . BP record part standard care available analysis . Pre post-dialysis reading record . Other variable weight fluid remove dialysis also note part routine care available analysis . 24-hour BP perform start end study participant agree . Cardiac MRI scan perform start end 12 month study period . Patients continue usual medication , remain unchanged throughout unless clinically indicate . CMRI Methods The MRIs normally do non dialysis day . If possible rarely perform MRI dialysis day . Baseline repeat CMR examination screen ( 0-6 week randomisation ) final 12 month ( +/- 6 week ) visit perform similar 3T Magnetom scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) use dedicate phase array cardiac phosphorous spectroscopy coil . Serial contiguous short-axis cines acquire vertical long axis horizontal long axis left ventricle ( electrocardiogram gate , steady-state free precession image [ true fast image steady-state precession ] , short axis image parameter repetition time 2.5ms , echo time 1.1ms , flip angle 60Â° , slice thickness 6mm ) . Analysis perform offline ( Argus Software , Siemens ) single blind observer assessment ventricular volume ( EDV , ESV , stroke volume ) , EF , leave ventricular mass . This single observer analyse scan site . The reproducibility leave ventricular mass assessment use MRI derive observer . A test-retest intraobserver coefficient variation 2.0 % usual past MRI study . We also assess reproducibility site , although observer assess scan site . We take opportunity measure MRI parameter interest easily obtain little extra scan time : Phosphorous -31 MR spectroscopy , T1 map aortic compliance method already publish u . [ 29 , 30 ] Both give significant add value . MR spectroscopy see whether allopurinol increase high energy phosphate ESRD ( measure PCr : ATP ) likely since know increase ATP level vitro know improve cardiac energetics ( MRI measure ) human heart failure . [ 31 , 32 ] We measure high energy phosphate ( HEP ) , compare Phosphocreatine : Beta adenosine triphosphate ( PCr : ATP ) ratio long axis view leave ventricle . [ 29 ] In addition use MRI ass aortic vascular compliance pulse wave velocity [ 30 ] use cine transverse thoracic aortic gate steady state free precession acquisition complement well peripheral vascular measure endothelial/vascular function assess ( see ) . Should scanner site become unavailable prolonged period time study alternative scanner use . Throughout study MRI method adapt appropriate ensure optimal study result obtain . FMD FMD offer participant main trial , may decline without affect participation main trial . FMD brachial artery perform non-fistula arm three visit ( baseline , month 9 month 12 ) use Philips iE33 ultrasound machine ( Phillips Medical Systems , United Kingdom ) accord guide-lines set International Brachial Artery Reactivity Task Force . [ 33 ] The brachial artery longitudinally image elbow use 11.3-MHz probe . The image record 2 minute , follow induction forearm ischaemia inflate cuff elbow 200 mmHg ( 50 mmHg SBP , whichever high ) 5 minute deflate rapidly . The result reactive hyperaemia record 2 minute . After rest period , procedure repeat , 0.4mg glyceryl trinitrate administer sublingually determine endothelium-independent dilation . FMD express per cent change diameter relative baseline diameter rest . Analysis FMDs perform Brachial Analyser software ( Medical Imaging Applications , LLC ) single train investigator ( clinical research fellow ) avoid inter-observer variability . This investigator blind allocate treatment . Our intra-observer coefficient variation FMD usually 5.2 % . Two factor ensure reliable result despite two site : patient always study equipment wherever possible individual ( research fellow ) test interpret ( blindly ) site . For reassurance , selection blind ultrasound scan re-analysed ensure good reproducibility site site . Applanation Tonometry PWA offer participant main trial , may decline without affect participation main trial . Pulse wave analysis ( PWA ) PWV determine non-fistula arm record radial waveform radial-carotid waveform , respectively , three visit ( baseline , month 9 month 12 ) use Sphygmocor system . The central AIx correct heart rate 75 beats/min . Wherever possible , single train investigator ( clinical research fellow ) blind allocate treatment perform PWA PWV sit . We also use bio-impedance time measure total body water MRIs do Glasgow site . [ 21 ] . This complement end diastolic volume data MRI site . In index study , EDV fell know due afterload reduction global fall body water . [ 21 ] Bio-impedance help determine . Research Blood test Research blood take baseline , week 6 month 6 , 9 12 . Research blood include BNP , inflammatory marker marker interest . Additional marker may test sample later date . The total amount research blood take visit 30ml . We shall also seek consent future ethically approve genetic testing decline without affect participation study . If agreement give , 10mls blood take end study anonymously store - subsequent analysis sample subject approval Research Ethics Committee prior analysis . Adverse event Adverse event seek symptom enquiry visit monitoring routine blood sample .</detailed_description>
