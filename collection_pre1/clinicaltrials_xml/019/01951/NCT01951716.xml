	<brief_summary>Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide ( GIP ) xenin-25 peptide hormone produced/released intestine help regulate blood sugar level eat . We previously perform study human measured effect xenin-25 GIP ( alone together ) blood sugar level . One study conduct intravenous infusion glucose without ingestion meal . In study , xenin-25 increased effect GIP insulin secretion- human without type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . A second study conduct conjunction ingestion meal . In study , xenin-25 reduce blood glucose level delay gastric empty effect similar human without T2DM . A variety study perform suggest xenin-25 work activate nerve . A specific nerve call vagus nerve play important role regulate insulin secretion . This study determine vagus nerve ( disrupted vagotomy ) need effect xenin-25 insulin secretion and/or gastric emptying .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Xenin-25 Insulin Secretion Gastric Emptying Humans With Without Complete Truncal Vagotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two group subject , without T2DM , study . One group consist people previously receive complete truncal vagotomy part surgical treatment unrelated research project . The group subject truncal vagotomy . Initially , potential participant administer oral glucose tolerance test screen visit make sure type 2 diabetes . They also sham feed test check completeness ( absence ) vagotomy . As outlined , subject receive 4 grade glucose infusion ( GGI ) 2 meal tolerance test ( MTT ) - separate occasion follow overnight fast . For GGI , subject give intravenous infusion glucose blood glucose level slowly increase 4 hour period . On separate occasion , participant also receive primed-continuous infusion GIP alone , xenin-25 alone , GIP plus xenin-25 , placebo ( constant dose 4 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1 ) . Blood sample collect GGI measurement glucose , insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , pancreatic polypeptide , GIP xenin-25 level . Insulin secretion rate also calculate . By compare result two group , learn vagus nerve mediates effect GIP , xenin-25 , combination GIP plus xenin-25 insulin secretion human thus , signal circuit impaired human T2DM . For MTTs , participant ingest liquid meal ( Boost Plus ) plus acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) . On separate occasion , primed-continuous infusion vehicle alone xenin-25 alone ( constant dose 12 pmoles x kg-1 x min-1 ) initiate time meal ingest . Blood sample collect MTT measurement acetaminophen , glucose , insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , GIP xenin-25 level . Insulin secretion rate also calculate . The rate acetaminophen appearance blood indirect measure rate gastric emptying . By compare result two group , learn vagus nerve mediates effect xenin-25 gastric emptying human .</detailed_description>
