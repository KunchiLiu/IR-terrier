	<detailed_description>To knowledge , study compare breath-enhanced nebulizer standard jet nebulizer treatment acute asthma child . The goal study determine whether rapid albuterol delivery pathway breath-enhanced nebulizer reduce ED LOS , maintain admission rate , repeat visit , adjunctive therapy , side-effects , compare traditional asthma pathway standard jet nebulizer . The Salter® Nebutech® HDN® choose breath-enhanced design bolus delivery system may deliver great amount albuterol small airway , short period time , compare standard jet nebulizer nebulizer class . The study site large , urban pediatric emergency department ( ED ) approximately 80,000 visit per year . The study protocol submit hospital 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval .

Children enrol research team member available obtain informed consent ( convenience sample ) . Children exclude enrollment initial pediatric asthma score ( PAS ) &lt; 3 , immediate resuscitation require , history chronic lung disease congenital heart disease , neuromuscular disease , intrathoracic foreign body suspect , may pregnant , currently breast feeding , receive oral parenteral steroid within last week ( inhaled steroid allow ) , allergy contraindication one study medication . Potential subject identify triage screen enrolment study personnel available . If consent , patient randomize one two treatment arm . If great 15 minute delay treatment due consent process , unit dose ( 2.5 mg ) albuterol treatment give standard nebulizer 3 time need . That patient may still enrol provide he/she still meet inclusion/exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
