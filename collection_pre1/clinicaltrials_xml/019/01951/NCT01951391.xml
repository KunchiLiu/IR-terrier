	<detailed_description>The timeline first 10 patient follow : On Day 0 , give witness , write , informed consent , medical history limited physical exam perform . If use certain topical product medication allow study , patient may ask withhold remainder study . The study doctor study coordinator explain medication activity allow study . Baseline bacterial swabs bilateral volar forearm collect followed application rinse hand wash right forearm , water wash leave forearm . 200 microliters water/hand wash apply volar forearm lather generate 15 second use gloved hand . The lather allow stay contact skin additional 30 second . The total contact time 60 sec . The forearm rinse run tap water 15 second , air-dried 5 minute skin surface swab bacteria . The procedure repeat 2nd volar forearm oppose wash . Subjects return 24 hour +/- 6 hour repeat bacterial swabbing AMPs three subsequent visit . Subjects instruct avoid rigorous exercise/swimming , significant sun exposure ( i.e . sunbathe ) , clean forearm antibacterial product , wrap forearm saran wrap showering/bathing period measurement . On Day 1 ( 24 hour +/- 6 hour day 0 ) - Day 0 procedure repeat new bacterial swab sample take . On Day 2 ( 24 hour +/- 6 hour day 1 ) - Day 0 procedure repeat new bacterial swab sample take . On Day 3 ( -24 hour +/- 6 hour day 2 ) - Day 0 procedure repeat new bacterial swab sample take . The timeline subsequent patient follow : On Day 0 , give witness , write , informed consent , medical history limited physical exam perform . If use certain topical product medication allow study , patient may ask withhold remainder study . The study doctor study coordinator explain medication activity allow study . Baseline bacterial swabs bilateral volar forearm collect followed application rinse hand wash antimicrobial compound right forearm , cleanser without antimicrobial compound leave forearm . 200 microliters water/hand wash apply volar forearm lather generate 15 second use gloved hand . The lather allow stay contact skin additional 30 second . The total contact time 60 sec . The forearm rinse run tap water 15 second , air-dried 5 minute skin surface swab bacteria . The procedure repeat 2nd volar forearm oppose wash . Subjects repeat skin swab 7 hour +/- 1 hour 24 hour +/- 6 hour wash . Subjects instruct avoid rigorous exercise/swimming , significant sun exposure ( i.e . sunbathe ) , clean forearm antibacterial product , shower 24 hour . On day 7 , exact procedure complete Day 0 repeat , however time procedure do use soap different antimicrobial compound right forearm . The control soap use leave forearm . The forearm washing skin swabbing conduct exactly .</detailed_description>
