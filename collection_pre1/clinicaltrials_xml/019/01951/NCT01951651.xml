	<brief_title>Effect Exenatide Liver Heart Fat Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetic insulin resistant individual excess fat liver attributable alcohol know cause liver disease , condition define nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . The fatty liver insulin resistant . Individuals fatty liver likely excess intra-abdominal fat well reduction circulate plasma adiponectin level . We previously show type 2 diabetes associate Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) characterize increase hepatic fat content , decrease circulate adiponectin level , hepatic peripheral ( muscle ) insulin resistance . Weight loss human Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease associate decrease hepatic fat content . Exenatide , incretin base anti-diabetes therapy , enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion glucose-dependent suppression inappropriately high glucagon secretion , improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes associated weight loss . In rodent study , exenatide reduces hepatic myocardial fat reduces vascular inflammation independent change weight . Exenatide also show increase plasma adiponectin level humans rodent . Furthermore type 2 diabetic characterized increase hepatic myocardial fat leave ventricular dysfunction , particularly diastolic dysfunction . However , effect exenatide therapy liver myocardial fat content , well leave ventricular function patient type 2 diabetes previously study .</detailed_description>
