	<detailed_description>Rationale : The current treatment locally advanced rectal cancer consist pre-operative chemoradiation treatment ( CRT ) ( 50 Gray ( Gy ) 25 fraction ) follow surgical resection , accord T-/N-stage , circumferential resection margin ( CRM ) tumor localization ( see table 1 ) . After neo-adjuvant treatment approximately 15 % patient show pathological complete response ( pCR ) , i.e.no residual tumor resect specimen pathologic examination . Patients pCR low risk local distant recurrence significantly longer disease-free overall survival . Furthermore , patient surgery could possibly omit . Selected patient clinical complete response ( cCR ) , define prior surgery rectoscopy , rectal examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , may opt organ-preserving therapy , call wait see approach . Response chemoradiation occur dose dependent fashion . Therefore , recent trial aim improve prognosis radiation dose-escalation result improved pCR rate . Toxicity rate associate radiation dose 60 Gy manageable differ study ; increase comparable even low toxicity . Moreover , dose escalation may increase proportion patient eligible organ-preserving therapy . Objective : We study whether addition radiation boost standard chemoradiation patient locally advanced rectal cancer increase complete response rate define pathological complete response , undergo surgery , 2-years local recurrence-free survival ( 2y-LRFS ) , opt wait see approach . Secondary objective adverse event due chemoradiation ( acute , perioperative late toxicity ) , tumor response assess MRI , impact boost local distant recurrence survival well patient-reported quality life workability . The need comprehensive study emphasize sub-optimal ( radiation- ) method , heterogeneity poor report previous trial field . Study design : Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial , nest within prospective cohort accord 'cohort multiple randomize controlled trial ' ( cmRCT ) design . Study population : Rectal cancer patient participate prospective cohort ( PLCRC project ) diagnose adenocarcinoma rectum undergo chemoradiation base clinical criterion ( see table 1 section 1.2.1 ) . Intervention : An irradiation boost 15 Gy deliver gross tumor volume ( GTV ) 5 fraction addition standard chemoradiation treatment 50 Gy . Thereby increase total GTV dose 65 Gy . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint complete response either defined pathological complete response ( pCR ) patient undergo surgery , assess standardize pathologic examination surgical specimen , 2-years local recurrence-free survival ( LRFS ) chemoradiation patient opt wait see approach . Secondary outcome treatment acute , perioperative late toxicity , tumor response assess MRI , patient-reported quality life workability , local recurrence ( disease-specific ) survival .</detailed_description>
