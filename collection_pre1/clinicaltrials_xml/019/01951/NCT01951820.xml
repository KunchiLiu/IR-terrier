	<brief_title>Comparison Two Topical Anesthetics : Benzocaine Versus Pliaglis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project double blind study compare efficacy two different topical anesthetic use reduce pain associate insertion dental needle palatal mucosa . The two topical anesthetic compare 20 % Benzocaine , Pliaglis . In order complete number different dental procedure , often necessary provide local anesthesia palate . Intraoral injection palatal mucosa often uncomfortable even painful . In effort increase patient comfort , topical anesthetic often use prior injection . Test subject undergoing routine endodontic treatment maxillary teeth 27- gauge dental needle insert mucosa hard palate part initial step standard local anesthetic injection . At injection site prior needle stick , mucosa topically anesthetize use one two different test compound ( Benzocaine Pliaglis ) . After injection , patient ask score level discomfort associate needle stick . The purpose project determine clinical difference level pain felt upon needle stick , two different topical anesthetic .</detailed_description>
