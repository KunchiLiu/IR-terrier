	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Adjuvanted Prophylactic Hepatitis B Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvants critical ingredient vaccine act boost immune response target protein ( e.g . hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ) . Despite considerable research , aluminium hydroxide phosphate compound ( collectively refer `` alum '' ) remain dominant adjuvant use human hepatitis B virus vaccine . There thus unmet need new HBV vaccine adjuvant , particular , adjuvant capable boost cell-mediated immunity ( particular type immune response killer T cell activate able attack destroy infection ) alum , although good stimulating antibody poor stimulate cell-mediated immunity . Alum , whilst generally accept safe , associate significant local vaccine reaction another reason new better-tolerated vaccine adjuvant would beneficial . This study compare range experimental adjuvant formulation identify provide safest effective enhancement T- B-cell immunity hepatitis B</detailed_description>
