	<brief_summary>Olfactory identification deficit occur patient Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , associate disease severity , predict conversion mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) AD associate healthy elderly subject develop MCI . Odor ( olfactory ) identification deficit may reflect degeneration cholinergic input olfactory bulb olfactory brain region . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( ACheI ) like donepezil show modest effect improve cognition associate adverse effect increase burden cost need prolong , often lifelong , treatment . Converging finding odor identification test performance ( UPSIT , scratch sniff 40-item test ) four pilot study , include two , suggest acute change UPSIT response anticholinergic challenge ( atropine nasal spray ) , incremental change 8 week , even baseline UPSIT score , may predict cognitive improvement ACheI treatment MCI AD . If change odor identification deficit help identify patient receive ACheI treatment , simple inexpensive approach advance goal improve personalized treatment , improve selection monitoring patient ACheI treatment , reduce needless ACheI exposure risk side effect , decrease health care cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In clinical trial , investigator evaluate , treat follow two broad sample adult patient New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center . Study 1 include 70 patient amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) . Study 2 include 100 patient probable Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . Recruitment clinic and/or advertisement . In protocol , 170 patient receive baseline memory olfactory assessment treat donepezil . Patients follow total 1 year . During time , patient monitor closely study physician receive memory olfactory assessment week 0 , 8 , 26 , 52 . In addition , olfactory challenge test do baseline . This project value selection patient MCI AD treatment base evaluation olfaction test predict response donepezil . Since mild cognitive impairment widespread Alzheimer 's disease represent major public health problem , study considerable public purpose significance .</detailed_description>
