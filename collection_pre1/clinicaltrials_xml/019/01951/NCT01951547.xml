	<brief_summary>Periodontitis , chronic inflammatory disease result irreversible attachment loss , bone destruction tooth loss , major oral health problem affect 90.2 % Malaysian population . It initially demonstrate Type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) risk factor periodontitis subsequently two-way relationship diabetes periodontitis propose . Diabetes show cause defect neutrophil function overproduction pro-inflammatory mediator Tumour necrosis factor-α , Interleukin-1β Prostaglandin E2 macrophage . The inflammatory mediator release response plaque report insulin antagonist disturb bind insulin receptor complicate hyperglycaemia T2D . The hyperglycaemia diabetic promote pathogenic bacteria subgingival microenvironment make susceptible chronic periodontitis . Studies however differ type periodontal pathogen present pocket . At time , study quantify . This study propose investigate effect non-surgical periodontal therapy ( NSPT ) periodontal parameter , HbA1c level , microbiological profile CRP level T2D patient chronic periodontitis compare oral hygiene education ( OHE ) alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ethical approval obtain Medical Ethics Boards University Malaya Medical Centre ( MEC Ref No : 696.9 ) University Malaya Dental Centre [ DF PE1002/0045 ( P ) ] . One hundred twelve type 2 diabetic patient ( diagnose least 1 year prior study ) age 30 70 screened outpatient Diabetes Clinic University Malaya Medical Centre total 40 patient fulfilled inclusion exclusion criterion recruit study . The recruited patient register Periodontology Clinic Faculty Dentistry , University Malaya . Patient information sheet regard study verbal explanation give patient . Informed consent obtain recruited patient understand could withdraw study time . Screening treatment patient commence January 2010 till December 2011 . The sample size calculation determine 15 subject per treatment arm would provide 80 % power detect minimum difference 1 % ( 11.0 mmol/mol ) change HbA1c test control . Accordingly , sample 20 subject per arm ( 40 total ) recruit compensate possible drop-outs study period . All patient randomly assign via coin toss age match NSPT OHE group . Investigator 1 screen enrolled participant assign age-matched group . Investigator 2 perform random allocation sequence use coin toss method assign participant different intervention Investigator 1 perform intervention . There blind participant examiner . As one examiner involve study , intra-examiner reliability assessment execute validate ability examiner constantly reproduce quantitative outcome measurement clinical parameter use . The Plaque Index ( PI ) , Gingival Bleeding Index ( GBI ) , Probing Pocket Depth ( PPD ) Probing Attachment Loss ( PAL ) measure time interval 3 hour . Utilizing Kappa statistic , good agreement ( &gt; 0.8 ) obtain reproducibility record clinical parameter . All recruit patient underwent full periodontal assessment baseline , 2 month assign treatment 3 month assign treatment . The clinical examination include Plaque Index ( PI ) , Gingival Bleeding Index ( GBI ) , Probing Pocket Depth ( PPD ) Probing Attachment Loss ( PAL ) measure electronic constant- force probe ( Florida Probe® ) . All patient instruct oral hygiene method use soft bristle toothbrush , compact-tuft toothbrush , inter-dental brush dental floss utilize modified Bass technique . Full mouth debridement , consist scale root planing , do single visit subject NSPT group use ultrasonic scaler Gracey curettes . Additionally , patient NSPT group give 0.12 % Chlorhexidine mouthrinse ( Hexipro® ) . They instruct rinse three time day use 15ml time period 14 day commence immediately completion full mouth debridement . Thereafter recall visit , participant re-motivated professional prophylaxis perform test group . 15 ml venous blood collect patient baseline , prior treatment 3 month assign treatment . Levels glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) systemic hs-C-Reactive Protein ( hs-CRP ) assess . Hs-CRP level assess use test high sensitivity CRP ( hs-CRP ) . All blood investigation do private laboratory ( Gnosis Laboratories Sdn . Bhd ) affiliation Department Periodontology . The HbA1c test DCCT align Quality Assurance laboratory certify Bio-Rad Laboratories ( USA ) , EQAS ( External Quality Assurance Services ) . Deepest pocket identify ( minimum 5 pocket PPD ≥ 5 mm ) isolate cotton roll . This follow careful removal supragingival plaque use cotton pellet curettes . Subgingival plaque sample subsequently collect use sterile curette pool sterile DNAse-free RNase-free polyethylene tube contain 1ml Phosphate Buffer Solution ( PBS ) freeze -800C commencement q-PCR analysis . Automated DNA extraction perform lab use QIAcube machine ( Qiagen® ) . 100 µl plaque sample place 1.5 ml centrifuge tube centrifuge speed 5,000 × g 10 minute tabletop centrifuge machine obtain pellet . The pellet place QIAcube-shaker automate DNA extraction QIAcube machine use DNeasy® Blood &amp; Tissue Mini Kit QIAmp® DNA accessory set . All reagent provide kit manually place reagent bottle rack machine prior start process . Finally , `` Bacterial DNA '' protocol select machine 's protocol list . Briefly , Qiacube machine underwent five consecutive step include lysis , incubate , bind , wash elution process . At end process , 100µl elute DNA available . The extracted DNA test concentration purity use Nanodrop machine . The DNA store -80⁰C bacterial identification use q-PCR machine . The concentration purity extract DNA determine use spectrophotometer machine ( Thermo Scientific NanoDrop™ 2000 Spectrophotometers ) connect PC base software . 0.1 µl elute DNA pipetted onto low pedestal arm . A fiber optic cable ( receive fiber ) embed within pedestal . A second fiber optic cable ( source fiber ) locate upper pedestal arm bring contact liquid sample cause liquid bridge gap end two fiber . A pulsed xenon flash lamp provide light source spectrometer utilize linear CCD array analyze light pass sample . The DNA concentration plaque sample reference strain measure record accordingly . The extracted DNAs eventually store -20⁰C commencement q-PCR procedure . The detection quantification P. gingivalis , A.actinomycetemcomitans , P.intermedia T.forsythia plaque sample do use Applied Biosystems® 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems connect PC base software . The quantification do project cycle threshold ( Ct ) value sample standard curve know amount ( concentration ) bacteria reference strain . For purpose , known amount extract DNA bacteria serially dilute ( 10 fold dilution ) subject RT-PCR amplification . This do provide standard curve prior amplification DNA plaque sample use q-PCR . Optimization carry order get optimum standard curve quantification . A final 10 fold dilution standard curve reference strain ( range 10ng/µl- 0.0001 ng/µl ) R2 value 0.956 used base quantification . To determine sensitivity q-PCR technique , serial sample contain known concentration individual microorganism process q-PCR analysis . The low concentration result positive PCR product regard sensitivity assay . q-PCR amplification do total reaction mixture volume 20µl . This mixture contain 2µl purified DNA plaque sample/ reference strain act PCR template , 10 µl 2x TaqMan® Fast Advanced Master Mix ( PCR buffer , dNTP 's , Amplitaq Gold , reference signal , uracil N-glycosylase , MgCl2 ; Applied Bio system , Foster City , CA , USA ) , 1µl Custom Taqman® Gene Expression Assay ( 20x ) 7µl nuclease-free water . The procedure conduct use 96-well reaction plate . All component reaction mixture ( except DNA sample ) add onto 1.5mL micro centrifuge tube . The tube cap vortexed briefly . The tube centrifuge spin content eliminate air bubble . The mixture transfer 96 well reaction plate follow addition 2µl DNA sample . The reaction plate cover optical adhesive cover entire well occupied . This reaction plate briefly centrifuge spin content ensure bubble eliminate . This mixture subject initial amplification cycle 50ºC 2 minute 95ºC 10 minute , follow 45 cycle 95ºC 15 60ºC 1 minute . The q-PCR amplification plot sample analyze determine Ct value . The Ct value project standard curve reference strain quantification . Comparisons change PI , GBI , PPD ( % ) PAL ( % ) within group perform use chi-square test . Intragroup comparison mean PPD , mean PAL , mean HbA1c , mean CRP frequency detection P. gingivalis , A.actinomycetemcomitans , P.intermedia T.forsythia assess paired sample t-test whereas intergroup comparison variable accomplish use independent sample t-test .</detailed_description>
