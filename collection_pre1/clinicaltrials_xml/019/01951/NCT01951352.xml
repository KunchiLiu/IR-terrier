	<detailed_description>We use tape-stripping method determine level antimicrobial peptide ( specifically LL-37 ) present human skin wash different commercially available hand soap . First baseline tape-stripping procedure measure amount LL-37 subject ' forearm . Tape strip involves apply small , round tape ( CuDerm , Dallas , TX ) skin , massage 10 second , remove . This process repeat 9 time tape . After baseline tape strip sample , participant 's forearm wash different soap . The soap rinse , skin allow dry . After forearm dry ( 5 minute later ) , repeat tape-stripping perform . This tape-stripping process repeat 4 hour later , 24 hour later well . Results LL-37 expression time point compare soap .</detailed_description>
