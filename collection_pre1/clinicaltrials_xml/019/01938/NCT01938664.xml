Angiotensin II ( Ang II ) know enhance noradrenergic activity , contribute effect blood pressure sympathetic nervous system responses stress . Inhibition Ang II show reduce craving stimulant , include cocaine methamphetamine . This clinical trial among 75 cocaine-dependent subject design test efficacy Angiotensin II receptor antagonist , Candesartan , treatment cocaine dependence . The result study provide medical safety efficacy data , guide future pharmacotherapy trial use class medication cocaine addiction . This 8-week trial include 1-week titration medication 7-weeks full dose medication ( week 2-8 ) , subject receive active agent .
