	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose pilot study evaluate whether MRI breast diffusion-weighted MR imaging identify feature specific breast cancer woman high-risk develop breast cancer . Participants : One hundred asymptomatic woman high-risk breast cancer recommend clinical breast MRI identify UNC Breast Clinic consecutively recruit study . Procedures ( method ) : Each patient undergo clinical breast MRI addition single 90 second diffusion weight sequence . A reader study conduct UNC completion patient accrual . The image analyse lesion , enhancement pattern , diffusion weight image data correlate pathology 1 year follow-up MRI exam . The study information enter secure database analyze .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diffusion Weighted MR Imaging Breasts Women High Risk Breast Cancer : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enrollment Recruitment : A total 100 high-risk woman enrol pilot study . High-risk study define woman significantly increase risk breast cancer . The Investigators use American Cancer Society Guidelines Breast Screening MRI adjunct mammography [ 2 ] . These guideline recommend annual screening mammography high risk woman include BRCA mutation , first-degree relative BRCA carrier , lifetime risk 20-25 % great , previous history chest radiation age 10 30 year syndromes relate increase breast cancer risk . We also include woman history previous high risk breast lesion ( ) atypical hyperplasia , lobular carcinoma situ atypical lobular hyperplasia personal history breast cancer clinical consensus . Patients schedule study contact research staff phone ask would interest participate research study . A script use determine patient interested hearing research study , call discontinue immediately . If yes , detail provide patient make determination would like participate . If patient interested , ask come UNC MRI Department one hour prior schedule MRI appointment . On day MRI study , patient meet study coordinator assign list study personnel consent subject study . Research coordinator/listed study personal go consent form patient answer question may . If patient agrees participate review consent form , patient sign date , coordinator sign date patient formally enrol . The patient undergo order clinical breast MRI follow one diffusion weight MRI sequence . Imaging Procedure : Each eligible patient , provide consent study , undergo MR image screen questionnaire . If patient contraindication , intravenous line place vein patient 's arm patient place prone breast dedicate MRI breast coil . The patient give earplug decrease noise level magnet 45 minute total time period . High-resolution MRI sequence breast axillary region perform gadolinium-DTPA bolus injection per order clinical breast MRI protocol . Afterwards , one diffusion-weighted ( DW ) MRI sequence breast ( ) perform . The DW sequence take approximately 90 second . The clinical image interpret per clinical protocol . The clinical radiologist DW image interpret . Therefore , influence clinical decision concern therapy . Needle Core Biopsy/Surgery : All patient recommend needle core biopsy open surgical biopsy breast lesion clinical Breast MRI schedule surgeon . The radiologist perform MRI-guided needle core biopsy surgeon perform open surgical biopsy blind result DW imaging , therefore influence clinical decision concern therapy . Reader Study : Five reader , radiologist expert breast image blind study result , give de-identified MRI DWI MRI image patient 's entry MRI ( MRIe ) study 1-year follow-up MRI ( MRIf ) study . Study radiologist data sheet complete study . The reader complete data sheet MRIe he/she read evaluate MRIf . The reader blind pathologic data time . For condition MRIe MRIf , reader check one checkboxes query present lesion type ( mass non-mass enhancement ) , anatomic location ( upper outer , upper inner , low outer , low inner subareolar ) , large dimension centimeter , signal intensity T1- T2-weighted image ( high , iso- low fibroglandular tissue ) , morphology shape ( round , oval , lobulated irregular ) margin ( smooth , irregular spiculated ) mass , distribution ( focal , linear , ductal , segmental regional ) non-mass enhancement , enhancement pattern ( homogeneous , heterogeneous , rim enhancement , dark internal septation , enhance internal septation central enhancement mass ; homogeneous , heterogeneous , stippled/punctate , clump reticular/dendritic non-mass enhancement ) kinetic curve pattern contrast-enhanced MRI ( persistent , plateau washout ) , signal intensity DWI MRI /ADC map ( high , iso- , low fibroglandular tissue ) ADC value mark quantitative analysis DWI study . The reader assign lesion ( ) benign , probably benign , suspicious highly suggestive malignancy accord imaging finding decide probability malignancy percentages contrast-enhanced MRI DWI MRI , independently entry final MRI study . After radiologist reader complete data sheet patient , data enter secure data base statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
