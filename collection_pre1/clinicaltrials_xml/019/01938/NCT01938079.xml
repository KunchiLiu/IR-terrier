	<brief_summary>In healthy patient , lung provide oxygen blood remove carbon dioxide . However , patient severe lung failure , blood may adequately deliver lung , lung may adequately supply blood oxygen . In case , patient may require assistance machine help provide oxygen . Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) device act artificial lung , allow patient recover illness . Patients receive support ECMO often put medically induce coma lung heal . Certain drug may stick internal surface machine ; therefore lead decreased concentration . Patients receive ECMO often require high dos pain medication sedative order provide comfort . Low dos drug , ketamine , may help provide additive effect pain relief allow low dos pain medication . The hypothesis patient treat continuous intravenous ketamine , low requirement pain medication receive ECMO acute respiratory failure achieve desire level sedation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Alterations During ECMO</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The administration analgesia sedation common practice patient receive mechanical ventilation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . Maintaining patient comfort safety , oversedating thereby risk prolonged mechanical ventilation delirium , ongoing balance act present daily challenge Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) clinician . Medication selection base patient 's need titration predetermine goal accordance publish guideline . However , major pharmacokinetic change occur use ECMO , include sequestration medication within circuit , increased volume distribution , case decrease clearance . As result patient 's receiving ECMO often require high dos analgesics sedative order provide comfort ventilator synchrony . In patient receive ECMO , excess sedative exposure , especially benzodiazepine , lead increase mechanical ventilation time , prolong ICU stay , short long term neurocognitive impairment , increase mortality . No study address outcomes patient receive ECMO . Ketamine , non-barbiturate phencyclidine derivative , provide analgesia relative hemodynamic stability maintain airway reflex . However , popularity wan undesirable side effect profile : Hallucinations , delirium , lacrimation , tachycardia , potential increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) coronary ischemia . Recent research , however , suggest low dos ketamine infusion combination opiate may associate adverse sequela may improve outcome critically ill population . To date , study compare clinical outcome ICU patient sedate ketamine compare sedative agent . Supplemental sedation intravenous ketamine infusion may decrease opioid sedative requirement patient receive mechanical ventilation ECMO . The benefit decrease opioid sedative requirement may translate few gastrointestinal side effect , decrease withdrawal syndrome , reduce rate delirium . Deep level sedation often require commencement ECMO acute respiratory failure , correlate Richmond Agitation Sedation Score ( RASS ) -5 . Supplemental low dos ketamine infusion may help prescriber achieve goal without use high dos fentanyl hydromorphone midazolam .</detailed_description>
