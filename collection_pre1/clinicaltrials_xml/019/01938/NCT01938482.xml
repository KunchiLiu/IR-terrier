	<brief_summary>The propose indication GSK1940029 topical treatment acne , early clinical plan evaluate irritation potential GSK1940029 ( Study SCD117225 - 3 Part study ) ; safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics GSK1940029 ( Study SCD117226 - 2 Part study ) , topical administration healthy subject acne patient . Study SCD117226 randomize , single-blind , dose-rising study evaluate safety , tolerability preliminary pharmacokinetics single 14 day repeat topical application GSK1940029 gel intact skin healthy human subject . Part 1 : ( single-dose ) subject receive 0.3 % 1 % GSK1940029 ( match vehicle ) , single approximately ( App ) 24 hour ( h ) ( 22.5h ) application surface area 400 square centimeter ( cm^2 ) ( 0.3 % ) , 400 cm^2 ( 1 % ) 1200 cm^2 ( 1 % ) , respectively , three sequential cohort . Part 2 : ( repeat-dose ) subject receive 0.3 % 1 % GSK1940029 ( match vehicle ) , 14 daily App24h ( 22.5h ) application surface area 400 cm^2 ( 0.3 % ) , 400 cm^2 ( 1 % ) 1200 cm^2 ( 1 % ) , respectively , three sequential cohort . Parts within Study SCD117225 Study SCD117226 interdependency . No significant primary irritation signal Study SCD117225 Part 1 ( primary irritation ) would allow initiation Study SCD117226 Part 1 . Once safety , tolerability exposure information determine Study SCD117226 Part 1 , Part 2 ( cumulative irritation ) Study SCD117225 may initiate along Part 2 Study SCD117226 . No significant cumulative irritation signal ( study SCD117225 Part 2 ) combination adequate 14-day safety ( study SCD117226 Part 2 ) would allow initiation Part 3 ( facial irritation ) Study SCD117225 .</brief_summary>
