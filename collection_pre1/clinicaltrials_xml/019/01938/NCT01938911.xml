	<brief_summary>To test psychopharmacological intervention strategy may provide new insight mechanisms underlie physiological hyperreactivity stress observe hypertension , plan test effect neuropeptide oxytocin social support neurobiological psychological responsiveness social stress . The study population project consist 80 hypertensive 80 normotensive non-smoking medication-free men . We expect exogenous oxytocin administration enable hypertensive effectively take advantage provide social support . Thereby , oxytocin may enhance effect social support reduce previously observe physiological hyperreactivity stress essential hypertensive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Social Support Oxytocin Administration Physiological Stress Reactivity Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Data psychobiological stress reactivity essential hypertension demonstrate physiological hyperreactivity acute psychosocial stress hypertensive compare normotensive control term sympathetic nervous system hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity , blood lipid , coagulation activity . Moreover , find low perceive social support hypertensive compare normotensives , high physiological stress response hypertensives low perceive social support.. In addition , collaborate group Prof. Heinrichs demonstrate OT social support interact reduce neuroendocrine response stress normotensive individual . Given finding give aforementioned hypothesized role OT physiological stress reactivity , particularly hypertension , seem promise investigate combined effect OT social support provision physiological stress reactivity essential hypertensive compare normotensives . Objective The propose project provide new information neuroendocrine mechanism underlie observed physiological hyperreactivity stress essential hypertension . Moreover , stress reactivity intermediate biological risk factor yet investigate experiment study effect acutely provide social support , either healthy individual hypertensive . The result project may provide important information development effective interdisciplinary prevention intervention strategy essential hypertension Methods The methodological approach social stress induction TSST use previous hypertension study translate plan project repeatedly collect blood saliva sample measure neuroendocrine reactivity term cortisol , epinephrine , norepinephrine , well continuously measure heart rate blood pressure . Blood pressure measure sample timepoint well twice TSST ( speech mental arithmetic ) . As recent finding suggest strong association social support heighten coagulation activity healthy subject social stress , find high lipid coagulation reactivity psychosocial stress hypertensive catecholamine stress change predict elevate lipid stress reactivity , plan additionally measure biological risk factor CHD .</detailed_description>
