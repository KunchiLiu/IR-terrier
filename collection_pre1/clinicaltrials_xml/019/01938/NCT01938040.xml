	<brief_summary>This study do investigator wish study way improve recovery surgery . Injury , include surgical injury , cause inflammation . Inflammation body 's attempt protect start heal process . Some surgical complication relate body 's natural inflammatory response . Although mainly heal response , inflammation also side effect delay recovery . The investigator wish determine effect medication know ibuprofen recovery . You may know ibuprofen name Advil Motrin . The medication give vein prior start surgery . Three blood sample take , two patient anesthesia . The subject ask complete several questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-arm parallel , multi-center study . Thirty subject ( 15 arm ) enrol . Subjects , age 18 , undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy general anesthesia screen eligibility participate study . Subjects screen , recruit , randomize preadmission visit day surgery . Eligible subject randomize one two treatment group 1:1 ratio receive either IV ibuprofen match placebo . Both men woman recruit , limitation racial ethnic origin . Participation study alter patient 's anesthetic management . Routine anesthesia monitor use general anesthesia use . Patients receive either 800mg IV ibuprofen placebo pre-operatively . After pre-oxygenation , general anesthesia induce lidocaine ( 1 mg/kg ) , propofol ( 1-2 mg/kg ) , fentanyl ( 5 mcg/kg ) . Tracheal intubation facilitate rocuronium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) . Anesthesia maintain air/oxygen ( 60 % /40 % ) , sevoflurane , fentanyl . The anesthesiologist allow administer additional dos fentanyl his/her discretion . All patient receive ondansetron 4 mg prior end operation . Patients awaken extubated OR transfer Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) follow simple command . All patient also able receive rescue dos opioids indicate Numeric Pain Rating Scale score &gt; 2 upon request . ii . Sample Size Justification : The propose study pilot trial design explore relationship inflammatory marker quality recovery . To knowledge vital connection never investigate . Therefore , use commonly accept method sample size calculation . Mahdy et al examined level IL-6 , IL-10 , cortisol patient undergo urological surgery treat indomethacin versus placebo ( 12 ) . A sample size twenty three patient per group sufficient show difference cytokine level . Tasdogan et al compare level interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha patient require postoperative ventilation abdominal surgery treat dexmedetomidine versus propofol ( 18 ) . A sample size twenty patient per group sufficient demonstrate difference cytokine concentration . Kim et al study change cytokine level patient undergo total abdominal hysterectomy pretreated clonidine ( 19 ) . These investigator study ten patient per group . The sample size sufficient demonstrate change IL-6 related surgical stress . Therefore , believe , sample size 30 patient per group adequate sample demonstrate change level inflammatory marker explore quality recovery . iii . IV ibuprofen administration The study drug give via intravenous infusion begin placement IV line . The dose fixed 800mg infuse 5 minute . iv . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Adults , 18 , undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy . 2 . Subject non-lactating either : 1 . Not childbearing potential 2 . Of childbearing potential pregnant time baseline determine pre-surgical pregnancy test . 3 . Subject American Society Anesthesiologists physical status 1 , 2 , 3. v. Exclusion criterion : 1 . Cognitively impaired ( history ) 2 . Subject require chronic antipsychotic history 3 . Subject anticipated require additional surgery within 90 day intend surgery 4 . Chronic use steroid opioids 5 . Subject receive treatment COX inhibitor within 3 day study entry 6 . Subject opiate , benzodiazepine , COX inhibitor contraindicate vi . Endpoints : Concentration cytokines TNF-alpha , IL-1Beta , IL-2 , IL-6 , IL-10 , IFN-gamma well prostaglandin E2 , cortisol c reactive protein different time point primary outcome . Changes mediator level IV ibuprofen versus placebo group compare . Plasma sample collect administration drug ( placement IV line ) , induction , end surgery operate room 2-3 hour end surgery PACU . All plasma sample analyze laboratory Susan Gould-Fogerite . The secondary outcome parameter quality recovery score ( QoR-40 ) measure quality recovery surgery simple fatigue scale . Forty question five dimension score patient five-point Likert scale . This assessment develop validated Myles et al ( 20 ) . Nine point fatigue scale often use assess progress recovery head trauma patient . Geriatric depression scale digits backward forward utilized . All metric administer day surgery , surgery , 2-3 hour end surgery PACUand postoperative day 1 3 . Exploratory analysis examine whether correlation exist inflammatory mediator concentration objective measure recovery fatigue . vii . Methods Procedures 1 . Data monitoring plan Adverse event include event report subject thought associate research . Unanticipated problem adverse event gather study investigator . Adverse event evaluate study visit , include follow telephone call . Any serious adverse effect report Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) accord regulatory requirement .</detailed_description>
