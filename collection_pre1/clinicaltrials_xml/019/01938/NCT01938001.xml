	<brief_summary>This double-blind randomized , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety lenalidomide ( Revlimid , CC-5013 ) combination rituximab ( MabThera/Rituxan ) patient relapse refractory follicular lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma . Patients randomize receive either lenalidomide placebo twelve 28-day cycle combination rituximab . Anticipated time study treatment 1 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Plus Lenalidomide Patients With Relapsed / Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( Follicular Lymphoma Marginal Zone Lymphoma )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Indolent lymphoma slow grow incurable lymphoma include follicular lymphoma marginal zone lymphoma . Follicular Lymphoma Marginal zone lymphoma cancer B lymphocyte , type white blood cell . Lenalidomide immunomodulatory drug ( drug affect immune system ) alter body 's immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel involve tumor growth . Therefore , lenalidomide may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide also show restore immune cell ' ability attack kill tumor cell , ability may inhibit follicular lymphoma lymphoma . The combination rituximab lenalidomide may eliminate cancer restore immune system 's ability attack tumor cell .</detailed_description>
