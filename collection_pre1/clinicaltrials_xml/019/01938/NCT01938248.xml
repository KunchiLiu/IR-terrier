	<brief_title>Apixaban Reduction Thrombo-Embolism Patients With Device-Detected Sub-Clinical Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Device-detected sub-clinical atrial fibrillation ( SCAF ) new disorder recognize since availability implantable device capable long term continuous heart rhythm monitoring . It characterize one run rapid atrial arrhythmia detect device without symptom without clinical atrial fibrillation ( AF ) detect usual method , ( i.e . electrocardiogram , Holter monitor , etc. ) . In ASSERT trial , SCAF detect pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) nearly 40 % patient 2 half year follow . The presence SCAF increase stroke risk 2.5-fold ( 1 ) . The risk stroke systemic embolism among patient SCAF CHADS2 score ≥ 4 2.75 % per year . Oral anticoagulation effective safe stroke prevention patient clinical atrial fibrillation , unknown risk benefit ratio exist anticoagulation therapy patient SCAF ( 2 ; 3 ) . SCAF differs clinical AF shorter duration , asymptomatic , often regular rhythm right atrium typically detect . Data ASSERT suggest increase stroke risk SCAF may less increase clinical AF . Therefore opinion leader write role oral anticoagulation treatment SCAF uncertain randomized trial anticoagulation need ( 4 ; 5 ) . Recent survey pacemaker clinic practice indicate 25 % patient SCAF treat oral anticoagulation ( 6 ; 7 ) . Thus clinical equipoise trial oral anticoagulation compare aspirin high risk patient SCAF . Apixaban Factor Xa inhibitor effective safe anticoagulant . It show excellent risk benefit profile stroke prevention clinical AF ( 14 , 15 ) . It highly suitable test oral anticoagulation therapy reduce risk stroke systemic embolism SCAF . Patients randomize double-blind receive apixaban aspirin . Apixaban dose 5 mg twice daily ( 2.5 mg twice daily 2 : age &gt; 80 , weight ≤ 60 kg serum creatinine ≥ 133 mmol/L ) . Those assigned aspirin receive dose 81 mg daily . The study event drive continue 248 patient experienced primary outcome event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Permanent pacemaker defibrillator ( without resynchronization ) insertable cardiac monitor capable detecting SCAF 2 . At least one episode SCAF ≥ 6 minute duration single episode &gt; 24 hour duration time prior enrollment . Any atrial high rate episode average &gt; 175 beats/min consider SCAF . No distinction make atrial fibrillation atrial flutter . SCAF require electrogram confirmation ( least one episode ) unless ≥ 6 hour duration . 3 . Age ≥ 55 year 4 . Risk Factor ( ) Stroke : Previous stroke , TIA systemic arterial embolism OR Age least 75 OR Age 6574 least 2 risk factor OR Age 5564 least 3 risk factor Other risk factor : hypertension CHF diabetes vascular disease ( i.e . CAD , PAD Aortic Plaque ) female 1 . Clinical atrial fibrillation document surface ECG ( 12 lead ECG , Telemetry , Holter ) last ≥ 6 minute , without clinical symptom 2 . Mechanical valve prosthesis , deep vein thrombosis , recent pulmonary embolism condition require treatment anticoagulant 3 . Contraindication apixaban aspirin : 1 . Allergy aspirin apixaban 2 . Severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance must calculate patient ; patient either serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL [ 221 µmol/L ] calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 25 ml/min exclude ) 3 . Serious bleed last 6 month high risk bleeding ( include , limited : prior intracranial hemorrhage , active peptic ulcer disease , platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm3 hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL , recent stroke within past 10 day , document hemorrhagic tendency blood dyscrasia ) 4 . Moderate severe hepatic impairment 5 . Ongoing need combination therapy aspirin clopidogrel ( combination two platelet inhibitor ) 6 . Meets criteria require low dose apixaban AND also ongoing need strong inhibitor CYP 3A4 Pglycoprotein ( e.g. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir clarithromycin ) 7 . Ongoing need strong dual inducer CYP 3A4 Pglycoprotein ( e.g. , rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , St. John 's wort ) 4 . Received investigational drug past 30 day 5 . Participants consider investigator unsuitable study follow reason : 1 . Not agreeable treatment either aspirin apixaban anticipate poor compliance study drug treatment 2 . Unwilling attend study followup visit 3 . Life expectancy less expected duration trial2 year due concomitant disease 6 . Women pregnant , breastfeed childbearing potential without acceptable form contraception place ( sterilization , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , barrier method abstinence )</criteria>
