	<brief_summary>The current epidemic rate childhood obesity lead health concern overweight/obese youth may suffer comorbid condition , consider exclusive adult . It suggest physical inactivity major determinant obesity obesity-related health risk child adolescent . Recent study adult report combination aerobic resistance exercise well strategy aerobic resistance exercise alone reduce risk factor type 2 diabetes . Currently , effective exercise modality concurrent reduction adiposity , particular abdominal fat , risk factor type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) unknown adolescent . Therefore , employ randomize trial examine effect long-term aerobic exercise , resistance exercise , combination exercise regimens : 1 ) vivo insulin sensitivity , glucose tolerance risk type 2 diabetes , 2 ) total adiposity , skeletal muscle mass , visceral adiposity ectopic fat liver skeletal muscle , 3 ) traditional non-traditional risk factors/markers CVD overweight boy girl . We recruit 168 sedentary overweight ( BMI &gt; 85th percentile ) adolescent boys girl age 12-17 year old randomly assign one three 6-month intervention group ( n = 56 group ) : 1 ) aerobic exercise ( 180 min/week ) , 2 ) resistance exercise ( 180 min/week ) , 3 ) aerobic resistance exercise ( 180 min/week ) group . A weight maintenance diet ( 55-60 % carbohydrate , 15-20 % protein , 25-30 % fat ) prescribe monitored group , change energy balance induce exercise intervention alone ( e.g. , calorie restriction ) . We believe propose application significant implication directly relevant one three American adolescent increase risk develop obesity-related co-morbidities .</brief_summary>
