	<brief_summary>This Phase I study , mean want find effect , good and/or bad , combination drug may patient liver cancer different dose level . All patient operation remove tumor liver may pump placed abdomen . On study , drug give use patient treatment cholangiocarcinoma gastrointestinal cancer . Both drug approve food drug administration ( FDA ) treatment liver cancer , two drug combine patient . That mean trial also want find combination safe . The study also evaluate treatment work delay stop cancer come back surgery .</brief_summary>
