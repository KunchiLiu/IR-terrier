	<brief_summary>Severe external internal bleeding common multiple trauma patient . Uncontrollable blood loss cause one third trauma death . A number blood clot mechanism know triggered major blood loss . These mechanism shall secure organisms loose even blood . To avoid overshoot clot behavior , inhibit mechanism occur well . An important inhibiting ( fibrinolytic ) mechanism fibrinolysis base conversion plasminogen plasmin . In severe bleeding situation mechanism tend overshoot therewith contributes severity bleeding . This phenomenon call hyperfibrinolysis find approximately one third multiple trauma patient . Mortality rate increase patient . Tranexamic acid antifibrinolytic drug inhibits conversion plasminogen plasmin therefore able limit effect hyperfibrinolysis . A large study show positive influence tranexamic acid mortality rate blood loss severely injured patient , administer early clinical setting . In study want answer question wether hyperfibrinolysis see early prehospital ( scene ) setting influence early prehospital administration tranexamic acid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In patient suffer multiple trauma initially respond emergency physician scene take blood sample thrombelastometry immediately i.v . access establish . According initial trauma life support protocol number patient receive dose tranexamic acid initial treatment scene transport hospital . A second blood sample take arrival resuscitation area hospital . Thrombelastometric measurement perform blood sample extent hyperfibrinolysis sample compare . In second step outcome patient receive tranexamic acid scene compare receive drug reach hospital .</detailed_description>
