	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) techniques diagnose breast cancer . New diagnostic procedure may sensitive way detect breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultra High Field MRI MRS Techniques Diagnosing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To implement quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) -MRI , diffusion-weighted ( DW ) -MRI , 31 phosphorus ( 31P ) MRS , magnetization transfer ( MT ) -MRI , chemical exchange saturation transfer ( CEST ) -MRI , high-resolution structural image 7 Tesla patient diagnose breast tumor . OUTLINE : Patients undergo measurement tumor perfusion permeability use DCE-MRI , tumor cellularity use DW-MRI , phospholipid metabolism use 31P MRS , macromolecular content use MT-MRI , cellular protein content use CEST-MRI . Diagnostic performance one , combination , metric investigate context breast cancer .</detailed_description>
