	<detailed_description>This Phase II randomize , double-blinded , control study 700 male non-pregnant female , 19 64 year old , inclusive , good health meet eligibility criterion . The study design assess safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine manufacture Sanofi Pasteur administer healthy adult different dosage ( 3.75 , 7.5 , 15 mcg HA/0.5 mL dose ) give MF59 adjuvant manufacture Novartis Vaccines Diagnostics without adjuvant ( 15 mcg HA/0.5 mL dose 45 mcg HA/0.75 mL dose ) . The A/H7N9 vaccine make HA antigen derive influenza A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus . Subjects randomly assign 1 7 group ( 100 subject per group ) receive two dos A/H7N9 vaccine without MF59 adjuvant deliver intramuscularly approximately 21 day apart . The dosage A/H7N9 vaccine give subject first second study vaccination . The primary objective : 1 ) ass safety reactogenicity monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine follow receipt two dos administer without MF59 adjuvant ; 2 ) ass new-onset chronic medical condition follow receipt two dos monovalent influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine administer without MF59 adjuvant . The duration study subject approximately 13 month .</detailed_description>
