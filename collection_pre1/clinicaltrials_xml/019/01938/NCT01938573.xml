	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose sirolimus give together cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride see well work treat patient bladder cancer . Biological therapy , sirolimus , may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving sirolimus together cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride may effective treatment bladder cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) sirolimus ( rapamycin ) combine gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin ( GC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine pathologic complete response rate cystectomy patient localize , muscle invasive carcinoma bladder ( clinical tumor [ T ] 2-4 , node [ N ] 0 N1 ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate rapamycin combine GC . ( Phase I ) II . To assess effect rapamycin GC deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage surrogates cancer associate stroma compare untreated GC treat stroma . ( Phase I ) III . To assess effect rapamycin GC DNA damage surrogates cancer associate stroma compare untreated GC treat stroma . ( Phase II ) IV . To assess toxicity MTD dose rapamycin GC . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose de-escalation study sirolimus follow phase II study . Patients receive sirolimus orally ( PO ) two hour grapefruit juice day -2 , cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) day 1 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo cystectomy clinically appropriate 1-4 course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
