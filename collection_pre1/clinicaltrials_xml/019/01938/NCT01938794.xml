	<brief_summary>Accurately measure many calorie person burn day difficult . Researchers technique call doubly labeled water ( DLW ) . This involve drinking water `` label '' non-radioactive tracer . After hour , label water detect urine . To measure many calorie burn ( Total daily energy expenditure , TDEE ) , urine sample collect several day apart . Although technique accurate , also challenge two reason . First , label water expensive . Second , urine sample analyze use equipment ( Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer , IRMS ) expensive difficult operate . The goal project develop new instrument perform DLW measurement TDEE . This instrument , call triple isotope water analyzer ( TIWA ) less expensive easy operate IRMS . Additionally , since TIWA accurate IRMS , may potentially reduce amount labeled water require measure TDEE , thus reduce cost . The purpose study compare accuracy measure TDEE label water use new instrument ( TIWA ) traditional approach ( IRMS ) . We also compare accuracy measurement TDEE whole-room indirect calorimetry ( metabolic room ) , consider accurate way measure TDEE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The high prevalence obesity US ( 17 ) major public health concern , overweight obese individual increase risk many chronic disease ( 5 , 7 , 15 , 18 ) . Obesity stem imbalance total caloric consumption total energy expenditure ( TEE ) , although cause imbalance remain debated ( 29 ) . Accurate precise measurement TEE therefore play pivotal role understand ultimately reverse epidemic . TEE measure use direct ( measurement heat production ) indirect ( measurement respiratory gas exchange ) calorimetry ( 4 ) , neither approach practical measure TEE free living subject . The gold standard measure TEE free-living individual doubly label water ( DLW ) method , base principle oxygen body water complete isotopic equilibrium oxygen dissolve respiratory carbon dioxide due action carbonic anhydrase . The consequence exchange isotopic label oxygen introduce body water eliminate combined flux body water exhale carbon dioxide . Lifson colleague reason , since hydrogen find water carbon dioxide , elimination hydrogen isotope would affect solely flux body water ( 11 ) . Thus difference rate isotope elimination simultaneously administer oxygen hydrogen label measure CO2 production . However , despite widespread use ( 6 , 9 , 10 , 20 , 25 , 29 ) , DLW method major limitation . Individual measurement precise Â± 7 % best ( 23 ) , method currently suitable study group rather individual variation . A second problem test expensive perform due need relatively large sample size achieve sufficient statistical power , large quantity H218O need dosing ( 23 ) , IRMS analysis . High level 18O require distinguish dose background isotope level 10 - 21 day elimination . It currently cost $ 500 - $ 750 18O require perform DLW measurement adult subject ( 50 - 75 kg fat free mass ) cost unpredictable due fluctuation demand medical diagnostic PET scan . The need high 18O enrichment cause fluctuation background isotope level time ( 8 ) . This uncertainty background level increase isotope dose must administer contributes uncertainty DLW measurement compare reference calorimetry measurement TEE validation study . Finally , IRMS analysis present set challenge , include need sophisticated , expensive instrumentation dedicate , highly trained operator , , general , measurement one isotope ratio time , reduce analytical throughput . Because challenge , researcher conduct DLW test maintain in-house IRMS facility , rely instead expensive slow analysis outside measurement laboratory . The propose work address problem develop new triple-isotope method DLW analysis , significantly improve individual accuracy measurement reduce cost DLW method , lead widespread use DLW method clinical research application . The overall goal Small Business Innovation Research ( SBIR ) Phase II grant develop validate new instrument measure correct background isotope level 18O 2H DLW analysis measure 17O stable isotope oxygen body water . This approach address two major limitation address . First , use 17O measurement correct background fluctuation 18O 2H , approach reduce amount 18O , thus cost , perform DLW study . Results Phase I study ( see Preliminary Data ) show background fluctuation 18O 17O body water correlate R2 0.96 , background fluctuation 2H 17O correlate R2 0.89 , background fluctuation 2H 18O correlate R2 0.92 . Based correlation , use 17O measurement estimate background fluctuation 2H 18O provide estimate forty percent decrease uncertainty DLW method due background fluctuation . Second , The propose instrument utilized new , triple-isotope method DLW reduce exist barrier widespread use DLW method improve precision , reduce cost , reduce technical expertise require perform analysis , increase throughput . Development new instrument perform business partner , Los Gatos Research , validation study perform University Colorado Anschutz Medical campus . In work , apply Los Gatos Research 's ultrasensitive absorption spectroscopy technology , Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy ( Off-Axis ICOS ) , simultaneously inexpensively ( &lt; $ 50 per sample ) measure 2H , 18O , 17O liquid water sample . Briefly , Off-Axis ICOS , laser light couple optical cavity off-axis fashion continuously measure similar standard absorption experiment ( Figure 1 ) ( 1 ) . The cavity provide extraordinarily long effective optical pathlength ( e.g . typically 5 - 10 km ) allow accurate quantification weakly absorb molecule . Moreover , since off-axis beam path unique , system extremely insensitive change alignment , make robust . This robustness combine long effective optical pathlength make possible measure water isotopomers high precision . Since development , Los Gatos Research ( LGR ) commercial customer perform many experiment validate sensitivity robustness Off-Axis ICOS measure variety trace gas include water isotopomers H2O , 1H2HO , H218O ( 2 , 12 , 14 , 19 , 26 , 27 ) recently water isotopomers undistilled human urine ( 3 ) .</detailed_description>
