	<brief_summary>Approximately two third stroke survivor profoundly impaired function upper limb . Currently main stay treatment upper limb motor function rehabilitation therapy focus repetitive skillful task practice ( task-oriented therapy ) show induce substantial functional reorganization undamaged motor cortex functional recovery . In spite rehabilitation therapy , functional recovery arm hand function limit one third stroke survivor great need adjunct treatment current practice . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive mean stimulate nerve cell superficial area brain emerge novel method modulate cortical excitability promote functional recovery stroke . There study use rTMS improve motor function stroke . However , whether 1Hz rTMS enhance effect task-oriented therapy upper limb function stroke investigate . In pilot proposal , intend investigate feasibility 1Hz rTMS unaffected hemisphere adjunct task-oriented therapy improve upper limb motor function among stroke patient . The information obtain pilot study provide platform future randomize control trial combine rTMS task-oriented therapy enhance motor recovery among stroke survivor .</brief_summary>
