	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation trial VS-5584 , PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor , subject advance non-hematologic malignancy lymphoma . This clinical study comprise 2 sequential part : Part 1 ( Dose Escalation ) Part 2 ( Expansion ) . The purpose study evaluate safety ( include recommend Phase II dose ) , pharmacokinetics ( amount VS-5584 subject 's blood ) anti-cancer activity VS-5584 . Biomarkers ( gene protein may predict show subject 's body may respond VS-5584 ) also assess archival tumor tissue , tumor biopsy ( consent subject ) , blood sample .</brief_summary>
