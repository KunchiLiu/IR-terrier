	<detailed_description>This study consist dose-ranging 390 subject randomize receive one injection Days 0 21 either low , medium high dose H5 VLP Influenza vaccine combine Alhydrogel® , low high dose H5 VLP Influenza vaccine combine GLA-SE , placebo preparation ( 100 millimolar ( mM ) phosphate buffer + 150 mM Sodium Chloride ( NaCl ) + 0.01 % Tween 80 ) . Seven-day ( 7 ) safety data first immunization first 25 % study subject enrol ( 98 subject ) tabulate review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , prior permit first immunization remain study subject second immunisation . Also , base medical expert opinion safety criterion define protocol , DSMB review might necessary seven-day safety data 25 % study subject follow administration second dose , proceed second immunization remain study subject . Twenty-one ( 21 ) day immunization , key safety immunogenicity data collect analysed . All subject follow safety Day 407 .</detailed_description>
