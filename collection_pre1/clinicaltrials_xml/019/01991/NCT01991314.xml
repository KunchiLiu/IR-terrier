	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anaemia common inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , affect least 20 % patient one time . Hepcidin , recently describe anti-microbial peptide synthesize liver , key regulator iron homeostasis . It interfere absorption iron enterocytes , macrophage hepatocytes bind ferroportin . Hepcidin level rise total body iron level rise protect iron overload ; conversely , iron deficiency , level low . Hepcidin level also rise influence interleukin ( IL ) -6 -1 , factor likely contribute iron deficient erythropoesis active IBD . Whether hepcidin level predict resistance oral iron therapy IBD unknown , though may impair immediate oral absorption . Adult IBD patient anaemic report quality life fatigue score comparable see malignancy . IBD diagnose adolescence interferes growth , education employment well psychosocial sexual development . Not surprisingly , adolescent IBD high prevalence psychological distress , particular depression . Limited historical , data suggest child adolescent IBD anaemic adult , less often treated oral iron . What clear whether apparent under-utilisation oral iron paediatric care perceive lack benefit doctor ' concern possible side effect include worsen disease activity . To address question , investigator propose comparative study 6 week oral iron supplementation adolescent adults iron deficiency anaemia IBD . Patients give oral iron supplementation . Before iron therapy , investigator shall assess haemoglobin concentration ; IBD activity ; quality life ( QOL ) , perceive stress , mood fatigue ; iron metabolism , include serum hepcidin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Iron Deficiency Anaemia Inflammatory Bowel Disease With Ferrous Sulphate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Before iron therapy , assess haemoglobin concentration ; iron status marker ; serum hepcidin concentration ; IBD activity ; iron tolerance ; QOL , perceive stress , mood , cop fatigue use psychometric questionnaire . Patients . Patients age 13 - 18 year define adolescent , age ≥ 19 year adults . Between January 2012 April 2015 , patient IBD ( ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , Crohn 's disease IBDU ( IBD unclassified ) diagnose standard clinical , radiological pathological criterion ) within next month due attend adult , young people 's paediatric IBD clinic Barts Royal London Hospitals , Barts Health Trust paediatric IBD clinic Chelsea Westminster NHS Trust , London , UK , screen result haemoglobin concentration previous clinic attendance . Those found anaemic sent letter explanation , invitation participate , trial . They telephone 1-2 week letter send ask current previous iron therapy : apparently eligible ( see ) verbally consent participate see trial doctor research nurse either next clinic appointment , another mutually convenient occasion . Informed write consent patient parent , appropriate , obtained meeting , patient remain eligible basis iron therapy history clinical , haematological criterion enrol trial . Definition iron deficiency anaemia : Anaemia define age sex-adjusted World Health Organisation criterion ( male &lt; 13.0 g/dl ; females child age 13 year &lt; 12.0 g/dl ) ( WHO 2001 ) . For inclusion trial , patient anaemic transferrin saturation &lt; 18 % . They also report either tolerance previous course ( ) oral iron , naïve treatment . Exclusion criterion : Patients exclude meet haematological inclusion criterion admission-to-study blood test ( 'screening failure ' ) , give oral intravenous iron within 3 month , previously intolerant oral iron . Other exclusion criterion age &lt; 13 year , vitamin B12 folate deficiency , anaemia cause drug use treat IBD , haemoglobinopathy , presence stoma ileoanal pouch , severely active IBD require hospital admission clinic , severe cardiopulmonary , hepatic , renal disease , pregnancy , breast-feeding , use cholestyramine , inability speak English well enough complete consent form psychometric questionnaire . Regulatory funding consideration : The trial approve Southampton National Research Ethics Committee ( number 10/H504/90 EUDRACT number 2010-023797-39 ) necessarily register Clinical Trial Investigational Medical Product ( CTIMP ) Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( number 14620/0035/001-0001 ) ClinTrials.Gov . The trial sponsor Barts Health NHS Trust . The trial kindly fund grant Core British Society Paediatric Gastroenterology , Hepatology Nutrition . Trial protocol treatment . At enrolment , demographic data include age , sex , disease type , education , marital status , smoke habit , weight height record . Disease type , location , behaviour extent , use Montreal classification ( Silverberg 2005 ) previous surgery note medical record . Patients complete six psychometric questionnaire assess mood , fatigue quality life ( QOL ) : Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS-A HADS-D ) ( Zigmond 1983 , Bjelland 2002 ) , recent general Perceived Stress Questionnaires ( PSQ-R PSQ-G ) ( Levenstein 1993 ) , Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) ( Kroenke 2001 ) , Coping Inventory Stressful Situations ( CISS ) ( Endler 2000 ) , Big Five Inventory ( BFI ) ( Ramstedt one John ref - check right ) , Multi-dimension Fatigue Inventory ( MFI ) ( Smets 1995 ) Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( SIBDQ ) ( Irvine 1996 ) . Symptomatic disease activity assess use Harvey-Bradshaw Index ( HBI ) patient Crohn 's disease ( Harvey 1998 ) , Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index ( SCCAI ) ulcerative colitis ( Walmsley 2001 ) . Blood collect blood count , include haemoglobin , iron study hepcidin , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ; stool sample obtain faecal calprotectin , objective measure disease activity ( Kopylov 2014 ) . Patients give 6 week treatment 200mg oral ferrous sulphate ( Wockhardt Ltd , Ranbaxy Ireland Ltd ) twice daily . After one week , patient telephone assess tolerance treatment : intolerant non-adherent oral iron withdrawn trial ask attend repeat blood test , questionnaire faecal calprotectin end trial measure . After 6 week iron treatment , measurement repeat adherence assess counting return iron tablet . Outcome measure . The primary outcome measure mean increase haemoglobin concentration adolescent adult group 6 week treatment . Secondary outcome measure two group tolerance oral iron ; change disease activity ( HBI , SCCAI , CRP , faecal calprotectin ) , SIBDQ , HADS-A , HADS-D , PSQ-R , PSQ-G , PHQ-9 , CISS , BFI MFI score , relation serum hepcidin baseline haemoglobin response oral iron . The SCCAI use score clinical disease activity three adolescent patient IBDU . Assays Haemoglobin , iron study routine biochemistry measure haematology biochemistry laboratories Royal London Chelsea Westminster Hospitals . Serum hepcidin assay store -800 C assay duplicate University Birmingham mass spectrometry ( Ward 2008 ) . The mass spectrometer calibrate assay service annually , Research &amp; Development Department Barts Health NHS Trust insist statement herein hepcidin assay meet strict GCP compliance regulation . Stool sample store -800 C end recruitment : extract quantify calprotectin duplicate ELISA ( ACCUSAY Calprotectin , Launch Diagnostics , Ltd , Longfield , UK ) Clinical Immunology laboratory Royal London Hospital .</detailed_description>
