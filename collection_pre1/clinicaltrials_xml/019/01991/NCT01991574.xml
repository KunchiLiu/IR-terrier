	<brief_summary>Ferric hydroxide adipate ferric iron supplement contain iron hydroxide dietary organic acid develop MRC Human Nutrition Research . We aim determine ingestion ferric hydroxide adipate food induces reduction urinary phosphate concentration , compare administration placebo plus food different occasion . We hypothesise ferric hydroxide adipate bind phosphate ion gastrointestinal tract , prevents part phosphate load meal absorb . On another visit , calcium give food , positive control , since element well know restrict dietary phosphate absorption formation insoluble calcium phosphates gut lumen . We compare urinary phosphate concentration co-ingestion calcium salt food versus urinary phosphate follow ferric hydroxide adipate food . Additionally , calcium data compare placebo data , since significant reduction urinary phosphate concentration calcium treatment confirm suitability study design . Finally , iron absorption ferric hydroxide adipate treatment determine label preparation 58Fe measure day 14 erythrocyte 57Fe:58Fe . The study design : Three-way cross-over volunteer absorption study . Volunteers tell treatment receive ( placebo , ferric hydroxide adipate , supplemental calcium ) . Researchers co-ordinating study day day basis aware treatment allocation , analyst tell sample correspond treatment .</brief_summary>
