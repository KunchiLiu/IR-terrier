	<brief_summary>Background : Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) condition characterize memory problem severe normal cognitive change due old age , less severe dementia . Reduced work memory ( WM ) regard one core symptom MCI-condition . Recent study indicate WM improve trough computer base training . Objectives : The objective study evaluate work memory train effective improve work memory elderly MCI-patients . Further , evaluate cognitive training relate structural change white gray matter brain , assessed structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging . Cognitive phenotype related memory impairment progression dementia also investigate . Patients Methods : The propose study blind , randomize control trail include 90 elderly patient Memory Clinic diagnose MCI . The group randomize either train placebo version . The intervention computerize work memory training perform 45 minute 25 session . Neuropsychological assessment structural MRI perform , 6 12 month train . Relevance : Currently know treatment available mild memory impairment/MCI , study specific cognitive training MCI-patients perform . The propose study receive fund Norwegian Health Region . If computer base training result positive change memory function MCI patient may represent new , cost-effective treatment . Secondly , evaluation training induced structural change grey white matter may improve understand mechanism behind effective cognitive intervention MCI patient .</brief_summary>
