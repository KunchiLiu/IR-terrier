	<brief_summary>Non-contact meibography useful tool assess health meibomian glands patient . Instead use normal light contact meibography , non-contact meibography utilise infra-red ( IR ) light . IR light shin patient ' inverted eyelid special camera allow visualisation structure meibomian gland , include duct acini . Currently , image take via non-contact meibography manually analyse skilled clinician . Knowledge health meibomian gland useful , especially diagnosis Meibomian Gland Dysfunction ( MGD ) . Studies show MGD one common cause evaporative dry eye . Mediview 2.0 software program semi-automatically classify meibograph image take via non-contact meibography . This software collaboration Shanghai MediWorks Precision Instruments Co. , Ltd . The algorithm use developed collaboration Agency Science , Technology Research ( A*STAR ) Singapore Eye Research Institute ( SERI ) . This current study aim validate diagnostic accuracy Mediview 2.0 assess health meibomian glands patient , trained clinician . We aim recruit 100 participant study . Once software find valid , trained technician could teach capture image hence leave doctor time focus clinical assessment treatment instead . Therefore , study potential increase efficiency clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) chronic abnormality meibomian glands commonly characterize terminal meibomian duct obstruction and/or qualitative quantitative change glandular secretion . This may result alteration composition function tear film lipid layer , subsequently destabilisation tear film . Studies show MGD one common cause evaporative dry eye . It recommend diagnosis MGD make assess ocular symptom , lid morphology , mebomian gland mass , gland expressibility , lipid layer thickness meibography . In meibography , structure meibomian gland , include duct acini observe . Photographic documentation meibomian gland also possible specialised illumination technique . There two type meibography currently use- contact meibography non-contact meibography . Non-contact meibography advantageous contact meibography comfortable patient . In non-contact meibography , slit-lamp microscope equip IR charge-coupled ( CCD ) device video camera IR transmitting filter . During procedure , IR light project onto invert eyelid subject image eyelid capture camera . Currently , skilled clinician analyse image obtain via non-contact meibography manually determine health patient 's eyelid . Through collaborative project scientist bioinformatics institute , A*STAR , Singapore ( Dr Lee Hwee Kuan ) SERI , semi-automatic algorithm classify meibographs healthy unhealthy previously develop . The commercial partner project , Mediworks , China , incorporate algorithms Mediview 2.0 software . This software consist module acquire meibography image well analyse image . Provided user draw outline tarsal plate capture image , software able classify image two categories- Healthy Unhealthy without aid skilled clinician . A trained technician could teach capture image hence leave doctor time focus clinical assessment treatment . However , accuracy reproducibility software validate clinical assessor original algorithm . We propose recruit 50 healthy volunteer 50 patient SNEC clinic public . Clinical importance Should modality image show repeatable , incorporated current protocol/workflow assessment monitoring Meibomian Gland Dysfunction treatment progress centre . The image capture project also use validate update Mediworks software , since hardware remain unchanged future . Study Objectives Purpose The primary purpose validate Mediview 2.0 software objective tool assess health meibomian gland . The specific aim include assess a. , accuracy Mediview 2.0 classify meibograph image ( Healthy Unhealthy category ) b. , reproducibility classification . Study design : Prospective study Rationale : Mediview 2.0 newly develop software yet validate tool assessment health meibomian gland . Methods : Participants target sample size 50 healthy volunteer 50 patient age 21 99 year recruit study . They outpatients accompany relative Singapore National Eye Centre . Permission would seek attend doctor subject recruit . Informed write consent obtain participant . Visit schedule One visit require participant . In general , come additional visit recruit whilst schedule clinical appointment reason . In exceptional case , meibography perform day , participant would give option come another suitable day study . Duration study : 12 month . Procedures : 1 . Imaging Meibomian Gland During image eye , participant require place chin chin rest slit-lamp microscope . The upper eyelid participant turn evert image meibomian glands present eyelid capture . This also perform low eyelid . This non-invasive technique camera IR lamp touch patient . During eversion eyelid , optometrist acquire 3 image one time . Thereafter , Mediview 2.0 software proceed analyse image healthy unhealthy gland . Throughout measurement , parameter meibographer , ( light intensity , magnification eyelid ) keep constant . 2 . Analysis Image Meibomian Gland The image take export assessed another optometrist unaware classification image Mediview . This assessor classify image healthy unhealthy . Results Mediview 2.0 software optometrist assess . Should disagreement result , 3rd clinician involve validation . Statistical analysis : 1 . Comparison software classification human classification Cohen 's kappa coefficient calculate assess agreement two rating . For interpretation calculate statistic , use recommendation Landis Koch , characterize value &lt; 0 indicate agreement 0-0.20 slight , 0.21-0.40 fair , 0.41-0.60 moderate , 0.61-0.80 substantial , 0.81-1 almost perfect agreement . 2 . Comparison first second software classification Similarly use kappa coefficient evaluate agreement first second classification make software . Expected outcome : The classification meibograph image Mediview 2.0 show good agreement assessment skilled clinician . Similarly classification meibographs take day eye show good agreement . Potential problem No potential problem expect study .</detailed_description>
