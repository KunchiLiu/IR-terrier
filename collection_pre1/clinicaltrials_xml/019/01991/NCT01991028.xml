	<brief_summary>OligoG new potential treatment develop AlgiPharma AS ( Norwegian-based company ) aim help people cystic fibrosis future . OligoG , derive marine algae , expect act locally lungs inhaled reduce mucus thickness improve mucus clearance . It could also benefit reduce incidence infection . Nebulised dose 540 mg/day administer healthy volunteer three consecutive day cystic fibrosis patient 28 consecutive day . Both group tolerate medication well , treatment related issue report . The dose administer study lower; patient complete study receive , total , 186 mg OligoG two divide dos . A new dry powder formulation OligoG develop patient use inhaler , rather nebuliser . Administration inhaler compare nebuliser much quick practical patient . In study , use gamma scintigraphy see lung dry powder nebulised solution go inhaled cystic fibrosis patient . Gamma scintigraphy well-established medical imaging technique . A small amount radioactive material add dry powder nebulised solution . The radiation emit detected taking image use device know gamma camera . The procedure relatively easy non-invasive . The purpose study help answer follow research question : - How OligoG dry powder nebulised solution distribute lung patient cystic fibrosis ? - How much formulation get deep lung ? - How much formulation remain device use administration ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Lung Deposition Radiolabelled OligoG</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary efficacy ( deposition ) variable % dose deposit lung . The following secondary efficacy ( deposition ) variable determine ( appropriate ) : Percentage dose deposit oropharyngeal , oesophageal gastric region Percentage dose remain Miat Monodose inhaler Percentage dose remain nebuliser mouthpiece Percentage dose remain nebuliser reservoir Percentage dose deposit exhalation filter ( appropriate ) Percentage dose contain mouth washing ( ) Penetration index base ratio count central : peripheral lung region ( C/P index )</detailed_description>
