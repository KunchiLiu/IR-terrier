	<brief_summary>A phase I/II trial conduct single centre , observer-blind , randomize , dose-ranging , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity single intramuscular injection plant-based Seasonal Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine administer healthy adult 18-49 year age . A total one hundred twenty ( 120 ) subject randomize four ( 4 ) group 30 subject receive one injection either low , medium , high dose level VLP quadrivalent VLP influenza vaccine placebo preparation ( 100 millimolar ( mM ) phosphate buffer + 150 mM sodium chloride ( NaCl ) + 0.01 % Tween 80 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 portion study dose escalation , cohort staggering ( slow enrollment ) 3 dose level ( low , medium high dose level ) placebo-controlled group : - Cohort 1 : A first cohort thirteen subject ( 13 ) subject randomize , ten ( 10 ) dose low dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine three ( 3 ) receive placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) consist Principal Investigator ( PI ) , Sponsor 's Medical Officer one external medical expert , prior permit immunization medium dose level . - Cohort 2 : A second cohort thirteen subject ( 13 ) subject randomize ; , ten ( 10 ) dose medium dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine three ( 3 ) receive placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect review DSMB , prior permit immunization high dose . - Cohort 3 : A third cohort fourteen subject ( 14 ) subject randomize ; ten ( 10 ) dose high dose quadrivalent VLP vaccine four ( 4 ) receive placebo . The 7-day safety data immunization collect review DSMB . If 7-day post-immunization safety data cohort satisfactory accord DSMB review , Phase 2 portion study proceed . The Phase 2 portion study observer-blind , randomize , dose-ranging study 3 different vaccine dose placebo . Therefore , remain 20 subject per vaccine dose dose remain 20 subject placebo group . Three ( 3 ) 21 day immunization , key safety ( Day 3 ) immunogenicity ( Day 21 ) data collect analyzed . All subject follow safety Day 201 ( 6-month follow ) , regardless phase study .</detailed_description>
