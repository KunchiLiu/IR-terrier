	<brief_summary>Recent large study show premature baby need intubate ( breathe tube insert ) ventilate , need give lung surfactant routinely . Those study show even small baby safely support use nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( nCPAP ) apply tightly nose use nasal prong . This type noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) baby continue breath , albeit additional support reduce work breathing . However nCPAP drawback , include cause skin damage nose , heat humidification gas always sufficient . We use , 5 year , different system support baby routine intubation . This another type noninvasive ventilation call nasal High Flow ( nHF ) use Vapotherm Precision Flow device . Published trial show least effective nCPAP provide NIV prevent subsequent need intubation and/or surfactant . However nHF superior nCPAP respect cause nose damage heat humidification excellent . This pilot study aim describe evaluate use nHF , use standard commercially available system ( Precision Flow , Vapotherm Inc. ) , birth , baby bear less 30 complete week gestation , view avoid intubation ventilation . This study important establish feasibility use nHF immediately birth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Nasal High Flow From Birth Premature Infants - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose pilot use mobile nHF unit , use Vapotherm Precision Flow device , premature population baby would normally either intubated give surfactant routinely , maintain nCPAP arrival Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) transfer onto nHF . Parents inform pilot permission seek . We aim recruit 40 baby less 30 week gestation . The reason undertaking pilot study nature establish feasibility proof concept . It design compare use nCPAP stabilise baby immediately birth ( although next logical progression prove feasible technique ) . The hypothesis use nHF stabilise baby immediately birth confer advantage use nCPAP stabilise baby way , demonstrate worldwide literature . For unit use nHF preference nCPAP , important step define management baby birth . There evidence nHF least good nCPAP prevent intubation reduce lung disease , may also offer additional advantage humidification reduction nasal trauma . The major challenge pilot project identify eligible delivery timely manner ensure suitable member staff available speak parent gain consent . Once delivery identified parent agree take part , follow process take place manage newborn baby . Check mobile nHF unit - The mobile nHF unit keep plug uninterruptable power supply ( UPS ) fully charge - To use , unplug check UPS functioning ( green light indicate full charge ) , set Vapotherm circuit ( per normal routine ) start machine run UPS power supply . - Gas supply cylinder check pressure 50bar air oxygen cylinder - Set temperature 37 degree Celsius - Once running , turn unit immediately need plug main power gas ( e ) available conserve gas . The unit run flow 1 litre/minute whilst `` ticking '' conserve cylinder gas need . - The prong attach circuit . Once baby bear - Place baby polythene bag ( per normal practice ) - Ensure baby breathing . If , baby bradycardic , normal resuscitation measure apply . It appropriate apply mobile nHF baby breathe clinically stable . - Once baby born , increase flow 6 litres/min - If baby breathe apply nHF prong observe carefully - Suction apply gently , need remove excessive secretion mouth throat . Babies high flow often `` blow bubble '' may lung fluid throat , suction vigorous - Apply saturation monitor ( per normal practice ) check Heart Rate ( HR ) Oxygen Saturation ( SaO2 ) . - Dry baby 's face sufficiently able apply duoderm dress stick prong cheek . - Observe baby carefully , ensure attention thermal care inform parent progress . - As soon baby appear stable , move NICU per normal practice Transfer NICU - Two people need effect transfer labour ward/theatre NICU , one move mobile nHF one move resuscitaire . - On arrival NICU , plug mobile nHF gas power supply ( switch manifold ) - Ensure second , cotside Vapotherm ( empty ) unit - Leave baby resuscitaire check admission temperature . - Stop mobile nHF , remove cartridge place cotside Vapotherm unit . Start run , run straight away . Ensure correct temperature , flow Fraction Of Inspired Oxygen ( FiO2 ) set - This process take less 20 second baby breathe detrimental - Transfer baby incubator commence normal admission practice - Document resuscitation clearly baby 's note Cleaning charge mobile nHF Remove mobile nHF , clean Vapotherm Precision flow nHF unit . Ensure cylinder switch plug wall recharge UPS .</detailed_description>
