	<brief_title>Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibition Psoriasis Patients With Diabetes ( DIP ) : A Randomized Clinical Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Psoriasis chronic , autoimmune skin disease affect approximately 2 % world 's population . It characterise keratinocyte hyperproliferation , aberrant keratinocyte differentiation cutaneous inflammation . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) express keratinocytes activity upregulated psoriasis . DPP-4 inhibition suppresses keratinocyte proliferation restores partially keratinocyte differentiation . The main site DPP-4 activity cluster differentiation antigen 26 ( CD26 ) . CD26 marker T cell activation key molecule pathogenesis autoimmune disease . One case DPP-4 inhibitor therapy improve psoriasis severity report . Agents use treat psoriasis target commonly underlying inflammation . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) sensitive , systemic marker inflammation . In people type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) DPP-4 inhibitor therapy decrease CRP concentration . Serum CRP concentration correlate psoriasis severity intervention decrease CRP concentration may decrease also psoriasis severity . Medications improve insulin resistance may decrease also systemic inflammation improve psoriasis . We show previously , psoriasis patient without T2DM ( lean obese ) , fast insulin concentration homeostatic model insulin resistance ( measure insulin resistance ) correlate strongly psoriasis area severity index ( PASI , measure psoriasis severity : r=0.48 , p &lt; 0.001 ; r=0.49 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . DPP-4 inhibitor prevent also degradation insulin secretagogues , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , thereby ameliorate hyperglycaemia without cause hypoglycaemia . Due effect DPP-4 inhibitor effective treatment T2DM . Other intervention increase GLP-1 receptor activation , roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery GLP-1 analogue therapy , improve also psoriasis severity . We report previously significant improvement two patient psoriasis diabetes treat GLP-1 analogue liraglutide . In subsequent open study 7 patient psoriasis type 2 diabetes find significant reduction psoriasis severity significant improvement quality life follow treatment liraglutide . Name Description Investigational Medicinal Products ( ) : Four investigational medicinal product use clinical trial : 1 . Januvia® 50 mg film-coated tablet , film-coated tablet oral ingestion contain 50mg dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin . 2 .
