	<brief_summary>Previous study iron absorption focus effect addition iron absorption enhancer like ascorbic acid EDTA meal recently enzymatic phytic acid removal phytase . The investigator want investigate effect fat iron absorption without addition exogenous phytase potential iron absorption enhancer lipid nutrient supplement ( LNS ) product compare micronutrient powder ( MNP ) product . Furthermore investigator evaluate effect Lipids- iron absorption induce ileal brake ingestion fat emulsion prior meal . Increasing caloric density meal increase fat content might enhance iron absorption delay gastric emptying , gastric acid secretion increase Fe stomach residence time .</brief_summary>
