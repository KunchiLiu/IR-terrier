	<brief_summary>This phase II , randomize , multi-center , open-label , parallel-group study evaluate progression-free survival maintenance therapy . Eligible patient treat within 12-week induction therapy . Those patient achieve CR/PR SD 12 week qualify maintenance treatment re-induction treatment potential drug component , randomize ratio 1:1 receive chemotherapy plus panitumumab chemotherapy alone maintenance . In case progression , re-induction treatment start .</brief_summary>
