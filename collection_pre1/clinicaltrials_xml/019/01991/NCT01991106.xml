	<brief_summary>The prevalence paediatric obesity increase last two decade , increase diagnosis lifestyle-related disease child adolescent . High intensity interval training recently explore alternate traditional aerobic exercise adult chronic disease potential induce rapid reversal subclinical disease marker obese child adolescent . High intensity interval training recently explore alternate traditional aerobic exercise adult chronic disease potential induce rapid reversal subclinical disease marker obese child adolescent . Goal : The primary aim randomise control trial evaluate effectiveness high intensity interval train intervention myocardial function , vascular function visceral adipose tissue obese child adolescent baseline , three twelve month . Method : Multi-centre randomise control trial 100 obese child adolescent city Trondheim ( Norway ) Brisbane ( Australia ) . Participants randomise ( 1 ) high intensity interval training , ( 2 ) moderate intensity continuous training ( 3 ) nutrition advise . Participants partake supervised exercise training and/or nutrition consultation 3 month . Measurements study endpoint occur baseline , 3 month ( post intervention ) 12 month ( follow ) . Scientific Significance : This randomise control trial general substantial information regard effect exercise intensity paediatric obesity , specifically cardio-metabolic health at-risk population . It expect communication result allow robust realistic guideline regard exercise prescription population form outline benefit high intensity interval train subclinical marker disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Worldwide , childhood overweight obesity rate approximately 10 % , high incidence attribute physically inactive lifestyle inappropriate nutrition . Early cohort study illustrate fifty per cent obese child become obese adult consequently high risk metabolic syndrome obese adult obese child . Both female male overweight child adolescents 30 % increase cause mortality . The increase risk death independent adult body mass index . Systematic review suggest lifestyle exercise intervention obese child adolescent lead improvement anthropometric cardio-metabolic outcome , inclusive several important outcome myocardial vascular function visceral adipose tissue .</detailed_description>
