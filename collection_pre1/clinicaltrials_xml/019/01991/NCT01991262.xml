	<detailed_description>Protocol Number : AI463-972 Date : 23-Oct-2013 Ver : 2 Observational Study Protocol AI463-972 - Help-B A Nationwide Epidemiological , Non-Interventional Study Evaluating Educational Support Program Improving Treatment Adherence Patients Hepatitis B Viral Infection Prof. Eli Zuckerman ; Dr. Yoram Menachem ; Prof. Rifat Safadi ; Prof. Assy Nimer ; Dr. Rawi Hazzan ; Dr. Michal Carmiel Treatment Chronic HBV The objective HBV therapy improve upon spontaneous rate sustain disease remission ( define long-term HBeAg HBsAg seroconversion rate off-treatment ) , thereby reduce risk disease progression , resultant improvement quality life reduction healthcare cost . Seven drug presently approve USA and/or EU treatment CHB patient HBeAg-positive -negative disease . They fall 2 class : antiviral/immunomodulators ( IFNα pegIFNα-2a ) antiviral nucleos ( ) ide analog ( NUCs ) . EASL AASLD Treatment Guidelines ( 2009 ) recommend HBV therapy may initiate currently approve agent , IFNα ( standard pegylated ) , Tenofovir ( TDF ) Entecavir ( ETV ) prefer first-line option treatment CHB patient HBeAg-positive HBeAg-negative disease . Poor adherence therapy complex challenge physician treat patient chronic disease . In clini¬cal practice , adherence rate average 50 % , fall dramatically first 6 mo treatment . Guidelines CHB therapy emphasise need optimal adherence , risk resistant viral strain emerge virus drug free holiday . For example , antiviral resistance report 70 % patient 4 year Lamivudine , 29 % 5 year Adefovir dipivoxil 1 % 4 year Entecavir monohydrate . The number dose omission may lead variable omission pose po¬tential risk viral replication breakthrough . Although , data CHB lacking , evident HIV literature near-perfect adherence ( &gt; 95 % adherence rate ) need achieve non detectable viral load avoid emergence resistant strain . Hence , clinical set CHB therapy , goal adherence remain 100 % . Unlike chronic condition , rapid viral rep¬lication potential mutation rate hepatitis B virus require high level adherence achieve maintain virological suppression . Suboptimal adher¬ence risk exacerbate exist liver disease , life-threatening particularly patient advance cirrhosis . Furthermore , lead development drug-resistant strain , limit therapeutic option additionally pose public health risk transmission drug-resistant viral strain non-immune individual community , whose previous vaccina¬tion longer protective . Given global burden disease , widespread transmission drug-resistant strain may serious wide-reaching consequence . 1.1 Study Rationale Non- adherence treatment well know issue across many therapeutic area . In Hep C , literature review show adherence real life may reach 65 % , drop-outs first 3 month , mainly due minor side effect . In Hep B , report adherence study show 50 % -80 % adherence , average ~65 % . Most drop-outs first 6 month treatment . Non-adherence treatment believe contribute liver deterioration also emerge viral resistance . Studies adherence support show average improvement around 10 % -15 % best . Assessed method : - Patient education - Patients empowerment - SMS reminder - Pills ' box electronic reminder The lack symptom along chronicity treatment , financial burden lack patient 's education - recognize important factor non-adherence . The abundance new drug viral hepatitis , high disease prevalence close relation effective treatment clinical outcome - create clear need provide treatment also efficient support system aim support patient ' adherence . 1.2 Research Question We expect ongoing patient ' support system contribute adherence increase . The support provide HCPs , continuous provide reminder , medical education direct contact patient HCPs . Therefore , study hypothesis : - An ongoing 6 month adherence support increase adherence rate Hep B patient - Adherence rate increase least 20 % . - Direct weekly telephone contact contribute major improvement . Smart phone application daily reminder contribute well need assess relative contribution . 2 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives At least 20 % improvement adherence rate newly treat Hep B patient . Adherence rate define per cent day patient take hepatitis B virus medication study treatment number miss dos . 2.2 Secondary Objectives The difference adherence improvement among 3 type adherence support : 1 .
