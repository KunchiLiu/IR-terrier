	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate ability new POC device , multiple electrode aggregometry ( Multiplate , Dynabyte , Munich , Germany ) detect clopidogrel resistance predict clinical outcome patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) comparison light transmittance aggregometry ( LTA ) , consider gold standard platelet function test [ 7 ] . 280 patient T2DM 20 75 year age treat oral and/or parenteral hypoglycaemic therapy least 1 month angiographically establish coronary artery disease ground previous ST elevation , non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome unstable angina treat clopidogrel 75 mg/day combination daily per o aspirin therapy least 7 day documentation CAD , recruit . Patients ' enrollment take place Second University Department Cardiology `` Attiko '' University Hospital Athens , Greece . Baseline assessment include record demographic data , medical history , cardiovascular risk factor , hematological parameter , number diseased vessel , number stented vessel , previous myocardial infarction ( MI ) , previous revascularization , ejection fraction concomitant medication . Patients renal ( creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl ) hepatic ( bilirubin level &gt; 2 mg/dL ) insufficiency , malignant disease , use drug know affect platelet function , history bleeding diathesis , platelet count &lt; 100x109/L hematocrit &lt; 28 % exclude . The protocol approve institutional review board `` Attiko '' University Hospital patient give write informed consent undergo study procedure receive study treatment . Platelet function measurement perform study enrollment . Patients identify either poor good responder clopidogrel . The primary end-point define composite death cardiovascular cause , nonfatal myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis , ischemic stroke , urgent rehospitalization acute coronary syndrome and/or revascularisation 1-year follow-up period . Episodes major bleed accord PLATO criterion record follow-up [ 8 ] . The ability two method detect clopidogrel resistance evaluate potential correlation response antiplatelet treatment clinical outcome assess . In parallel , patient similar characteristic , treat prasugrel ticagrelor , use control group sample size . Platelet Function Analysis Platelet function analysis perform Laboratory Haematology Blood Bank Unit `` Attiko '' University Hospital . Blood sample collect antecubital vein 2 4 h antiplatelet therapy intake . The first 2 4 ml blood discard avoid spontaneous platelet activation platelet function test perform within two hour sample . Light transmittance aggregometry ( LTA ) The whole blood specimen collect 3.8 % trisodium citrate centrifuge 200 g 10 minute obtain platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) . The remain specimen re-centrifuged 2000 g 15 minute obtain platelet-poor plasma ( PPP ) . The platelet count adjust 200,000/μl 300,000/μl PPP . Aggregation perform use Biodata-PAP-4 aggregometer ( Bio/Data Corporation , PA , USA ) . The 100 % line set use PPP 0 % baseline establish PRP addition agonist . The agonist use ADP 2.0×10−5 M ( Bio/Data Corporation , PA , USA ) . Test procedure perform previously describe [ 9 ] . In brief , 0.45 mL PRP transfer cuvette incubate 37 °C 3 minute . Then 0.05 mL agonist add PRP aggregation pattern allow generate 6 minute . Platelet aggregation determine maximal percent change light transmittance baseline use PPP reference . Cut-off value &gt; 59 % aggregation follow 20 microM ADP stimulation define indicating high on-treatment platelet reactivity [ 10 ] . Other test parameter late aggregation degree disaggregation . Multiple electrode aggregometry ( MEA ) Platelet aggregation whole blood assess MEA use impedance aggregometer ( Multiplate , Dynabyte , Munich , Germany ) . Samples collect 3.2 % citrate tube analyze within period half two hour blood collection accord manufacturer 's instruction . Platelet aggregation induce ADP final concentration 6.5 μM . Each disposable test cell contain two pair electrode , thus enable two simultaneous measurement . Aggregation report area curve ( AUC ) , integrate measure aggregation velocity maximal aggregation . Cut-off value HRPR MEA ( &gt; 468 arbitrary aggregation units/min response ADP Multiplate analyzer ) define accord recently publish consensus statement definition high on-treatment platelet reactivity adenosine diphosphate [ 11 ] . Statistical Methods 1 . Primary endpoint : In prospective cohort study , primary end point define composite death cardiovascular cause , nonfatal myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis , ischemic stroke , urgent rehospitalisation acute coronary syndrome and/or revascularisation 1-year follow-up period . Episodes major bleed accord PLATO criterion record follow-up . 2 . Descriptive statistic : They present mean ± SD , median interquartile range ( IQR ) , percentages appropriate . 3 . Comparison baseline data ( demographic data , medical history , cardiovascular risk factor , hematological parameter , number diseased vessel , previous myocardial infarction , previous revascularisation , ejection fraction concomitant medication ) responder non-responders clopidogrel : First , use Shapiro-Wilk test check normality data distribution . Continuous variable compare mean two-sample Student 's test ( distribution find normal ) mean non-parametric two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum ( Mann-Whitney ) test ( distribution find non-normal ) . Categorical variable compare use Pearson 's chi-squared test . 4 . Agreement two method detect resistance clopidogrel : Agreement `` Multiplate '' `` ADP-induced LTA '' determine kappa statistic respective p-values . Kappa value &lt; 0.20 consider indicate poor agreement , 0.21 0.40 indicate fair agreement , 0.41 0.60 indicate moderate agreement , 0.61 0.80 indicate good agreement , &gt; 0.81 indicate good agreement . 5 . Correlation laboratory resistance clinical outcome : Logistic regression analysis use order evaluate whether method detect resistance clopidogrel ( `` Multiplate '' `` ADP-induced LTA '' ) associate clinical outcome ( end-point ) . To evaluate whether association independent , certain covariates well-known risk factor ( ie. , cardiovascular risk factor , number diseased vessel , previous myocardial infarction , previous revascularisation , etc ) include multivariable logistic regression model . The crude adjust odds ratio ( ORs ) correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) present . 6 . Level significance : For hypothesis testing , probability level &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical test two-sided . 7 . Statistical software : Stata software use statistical analysis ( Stata Corp. , College Station , TX , USA ) . 8 . Sample size calculation : For study sample size calculation , hypothesize clopidogrel resistance CR ( + ) prevalent among T2DM patient compare non-DM patient [ 12 , 13 ] ; time , DM group patient clopidogrel resistance suffer increase likelihood adverse cardiovascular event [ 14 ] . It show 13 % general population T2DM patient suffer major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) [ include death secondary cardiovascular cause , ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) unstable angina ( UA ) stroke ] ; number increase 38 % among T2DM patient clopidogrel resistance remain clopidogrel treatment [ 15 ] . The sample size need detect difference adverse event rate - CR ( + ) CR ( - ) diabetic patient - two-sided risk 5 % b risk 20 % ( power 80 % ) 101 patient [ 40 CR ( + ) group 61 CR ( - ) group ] . If assume attrition rate 10 % , sample size increase 111 patient [ 44 CR ( + ) group 67 CR ( - ) group ] . Finally , take consideration clopidogrel resistance among T2DM patient estimate reach approximately 40 % [ 16-18 ] , initial sample diabetic patient 2.5 time large , 278 patient ( 111 clopidogrel-resistant 167 clopidogrel-sensitive ) . The statistical software G*Power 3.1.3 ( Kiel , Germany ) use sample size calculation .</detailed_description>
