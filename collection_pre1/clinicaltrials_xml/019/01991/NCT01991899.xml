	<brief_summary>It clinicaltrial Phase III , randomize , double -blind , 4-arm ( 390 one ) : This study include 1560 child use 3 batch vaccine produce Bio - Manguinhos viral bulk GSK combine measles , mumps rubella apply healthy child 12-15 month age , 01 batch MMR reference ( GSK ) , apply healthy child age 12-15 month old . The vaccine administer MMR 1st dose . Two hypothesis test : 1 . Consistency production ( equivalence batch ) 3 batch vacines ( TV1 , TV2 , TV3 Bio- Manguinhos ) . Noninferiority vaccine Bio TV ( Fiocruz , Rio de Janeiro ) , ie , measles , mumps rubella Brazil immunogenic safe measles , mumps rubella reference , already use routine NIP ( production Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ viral concentrate , bulk , GSK ) . The MMR vaccine ( Bio-TV ) composition ( vaccine strain ) method production MMR ( TV-GSK ) : Wistar RA27 / 3 rubella , Schwarz strain measles vaccine , strain RIT 4385 - derive Jeryl Lynn strain mumps vaccine . As 2nd dose , child receive vaccine tetraviral measles-mumps-rubella-varicella , age 15-18 month , accord guidance National Immunization Program . 2 . Noninferiority vaccine Bio TV ( Fiocruz , Rio de Janeiro ) : measles , mumps rubella vaccine Brazil immunogenic safe measles , mumps rubella reference , already use routine NIP ( production Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ viral concentrate , bulk , GSK ) . Returns blood sample schedule 51 day , range 42 60 day dose MMR vaccine dose tetraviral . We colect firt blood sample first vaccination . It describe major adverse event observed vaccination , compare frequency group MMR vaccine Brazilian reference vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Status : Not yet recruit : participant yet recruit Parents guardian , potential participant study , identify field staff project invite interview host , present study objective , necessary procedure ( vaccine , blood collection pre-vaccination postvaccination , interview , etc.. ) , frequency , duration , benefit risk study . It also read discuss Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . It make Serology , pre-and post-vaccination , use technique enzyme immunoassay ( ELISA DadeBehring / SIEMENS ) measles , rubella , mumps varicella , titration specific IgG antibody Laboratory Respiratory Virus / IOC / Fiocruz ; Titration neutralize antibody measles mumps , pre post vaccination ( Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test , PRNT ) sample successful seronegative . Will hold LATEV / Bio-Manguinhos / Fiocruz . Control adverse event application vaccine make mean annotation complete responsible journal analyzed doctor . They number phone 24 hour contact doctor . The monitor visit initiation study ( day 0 ) , regular visit study visit close soon completion study . Monitors review FRC , compare source document verify accuracy data collection , assess adherence good clinical practice ensure study data complete , accurate integer . Monitors make sure existence time , space qualify personnel day monitor visit . Plan data analysis The consistency production batch ( equivalence ) .Upper low limit confidence interval 95 % difference seroprotection result three pair contrast antigen lot ( three batch compare pair ) -10 % +10 % , two-tailed analysis . . ratio geometric mean titer antigens 0.5 2 . The 3 lot consider consistent term TMG particular vaccine component , three 95 % CI ratio two-tailed paired TMG 0.5 2 . Non-inferiority - Difference seroprotection antigens vaccine test reference vaccine great - 10 % , one-tailed analysis . More precisely , low limit 95 % difference seroprotection rate vaccine test reference vaccine great 10 % ( e.g . 4 % , -3 % , etc . . ) - ratio geometric mean titer antigens â‰¥ 0.5 ( vaccine vaccine Bio-Manguinhos reference ) . The analysis non-inferiority take account three batch vaccine TV1 , TV2 , TV3 compare together reference vaccine , consistency production batch . This procedure perform 2nd serology vaccination .</detailed_description>
