	<brief_summary>Patients undergo allogeneic blood marrow transplantation ( HSCT ) experience prolonged period dysfunctional immunity . Systematic reimmunization necessary appropriate time interval follow transplantation re-establish immunity . Vaccination practice HSCT remain varied data sparse . Tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ) one severe infection central nervous system cause tick-borne flavivirus . There specific treatment , prevention vaccine intervention available . To assess efficacy TBE vaccination adult allogeneic HSCT recipient compare age-matched sex-matched control group healthy volunteer without previous TBE vaccination , prospective open-label phase II pilot study humoral cellular immune response use TBE vaccine ( FSME Immun ) perform . As primary end point outcome neutralization test ( NT ) TBE assess total 26 HSCT patient one year HSCT 26 healthy volunteer , namely four week second vaccination . Therefore , number subject NT titres TBE virus &gt; 10 , assume threshold antibody-mediated protection evaluate . As secondary endpoint , antibody concentration TBE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay four week second third vaccination antibody concentration NT TBE four week primary immunization . To evaluate cellular immune response , lymphocyte proliferation assay cytokine detection assay perform . In subgroup analysis , secondary endpoint compare healthy volunteer , HSCT patient without immunosuppressive treatment HSCT patient receive immunosuppressive agent . Additionally , immune reconstitution analysis peripheral blood lymphocyte subset serum immunoglobulin level evaluate prior vaccination , twelve week prior third vaccination HSCT patient .</brief_summary>
