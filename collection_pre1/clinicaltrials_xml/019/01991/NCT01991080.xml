	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Relaxation Wheat Germ Juice Immune Indices Quality Life ( QoL ) Colorectal Cancer Patients Adjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The immune system play important role fight cancer . According certain study , Levels cytokine secrete immune cell find predictor prognosis survival among cancer patient , well disease recurrence1 . Pro-inflammatory cytokine , IL-6 , IL-8 IL-10 find negative prognostic factor different cancer type , include colorectal cancer , IL-12 find several study positive prognostic factor . However , inconclusive result find role IL-12 anti-inflammatory cytokine cancer prognosis . Previous study , include meta-analyses , report chronic emotional stress depression associate high level pro-inflammatory cytokines2 ; furthermore , , albeit inconclusive , evidence may predict low survival rates3 . Moreover , evidence personal resource optimism control perception may effect psychological physical well-being ( i.e. , low level psychological physical symptom reaction stressful event ) dysregulate immune function level pro-inflammatory cytokine . Practicing relaxation find decrease psychological symptom among cancer patient , depression , anger , hostility anxiety symptom , well physical symptom , include fatigue , insomnia pain . In addition , relaxation may reduce nausea vomit follow chemotherapy . Several study cancer patient report positive association relaxation-based intervention immune measure , elevate rate T-cell subpopulation well increase IL-4 production decrease IL-10 production4 . Similarly , biofeedback-assisted relaxation associate enhanced natural killer cell activity , lymphocyte responsiveness , number peripheral blood lymphocytes5 . However , result always conclusive , study investigate relationship relaxation training immune measure often include small uncontrolled sample . Wheatgrass juice extract squeeze mature sprout wheat seed ( Triticum aestivum ) . Currently , laboratory medical study examine beneficial effect wheatgrass consumption . These study tend report positive effect minimal side effect among patient arthritis , thalassemia ulcerative colitis . Lab research demonstrate wheatgrass consumption cause prolonged latent period skin cancer mouse . Controlled clinical trial find wheatgrass juice may reduce chemotherapy-induced myelotoxicity , accompany fever infection without harm chemotherapy effectiveness among breast cancer patients6 . Aims In light lack study examine effect wheatgrass consumption immune well-being measure , well limited data study regard effect biofeedback-assisted relaxation immune parameter , aim current study follow : 1 . To examine difference immune measure ( serum micro-particles level cytokine IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 IL-12 ) , physical psychological well-being measure ( anxiety , depression , pain , fatigue , nausea ) three time point two intervention method ( biofeedback-assisted relaxation wheatgrass consumption ) intervention group vs. control group , among colorectal cancer patient . 2 . To assess mediate role optimism , perceive control well-being measure ( anxiety , depression , pain , fatigue , nausea ) among colorectal cancer patient relation intervention ( biofeedback-assisted relaxation wheatgrass consumption ) immune measure ( serum micro-particles level cytokine IL-6 , IL-8 IL-10 IL-12 ) , mediate role well-being measure relation optimism perceive control immune measure . Methods Participants include 120 colorectal cancer patient age 18+ , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 disease stage II III , receive adjuvant chemotherapy Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) FU-5 treatment , conjoin Oxaliplatin , Capecitabine alone follow curative surgery Rambam Health Care Campus . The estimated number participant calculate base Green 's equation ( 1991 ) : 50+8X 7 ( The Regression Model require 50 participant + 8 participant variable ) . Possible parameter monitor use regression analysis : age , gender , blood Albumin level , morbidity ( include : diabetes , hypertension , heart disease , stroke , arthritis ) , optimism control perception . A comparison two treatment group , well comparison treatment group control group ( 80 subject ) allow inclusion four background parameter regression , accord Green 's equation . Due large number background parameter potential confounding variable , parameter significant association dependent variable include . In univariate statistical analysis , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) conduct order compare study group . In addition , comparison outcome parameter intervention period conduct use paired t-tests Repeated measure analysis . As calculated sample size statistical power sufficient regression analysis ( multivariate statistical analysis ) , also suitable univariate statistical analysis . Following recruitment , participant randomly divide 2 intervention group : biofeedback-assisted relaxation wheatgrass consumption . The control group consist subject interested participate active intervention , agree contribute blood sample chemotherapy treatment purpose study . This study design select expect recruitment rate allow random allocation test control group . However , control enable u compare immune parameter patient refuse participate study , allocate group , order neutralize effect oncology treatment compare group . In addition , treatment group evaluate immune well-being parameter , subject 's pre-treatment status serve control post-treatment status . Blood sample collect baseline ( onset chemotherapy ) , 3 6 month later measure level cytokine ( IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 ) serum micro-particles . Well-being assess 3 time point via questionnaire , include emotional physical symptom : anxiety , depression , pain , nausea vomiting , chronic fatigue level . Demographical medical information take medical record . The two study intervention continue 6 month ( chemotherapy treatment period ) . ( 1 ) Biofeedback-assisted relaxation intervention group : participant receive biofeedback device practice relaxation home . Four session conduct psychologist specialize biofeedback therapy . During session , relaxation technique learn practice . ( 2 ) Wheatgrass intervention group : Each patient supply frozen wheatgrass juice divide daily dos 60 cc . Patients ask drink one dose every morning empty stomach . Study importance potential contribution This first study examine possible effect biofeedback-assisted relaxation vs. wheatgrass juice immune well-being parameter among colorectal cancer patient . To best knowledge , first study investigate possible effect biofeedback-assisted relaxation serum level pro-inflammatory cytokine . Using randomize controlled design three time point homogenous sample term disease parameter , type treatment functional status allow u obtain valid result regard psychological physical parameter well-being pro-inflammatory biomarkers . Possible verification study hypotheses add theoretical knowledge effect personal resource psychological well-being immune measure may suggest potential way improve well-being well cancer-related symptom , even disease course among colorectal cancer patient</detailed_description>
