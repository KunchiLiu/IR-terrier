	<brief_summary>The goal exploratory study determine feasibility integrate electronic clinical decision support routine clinical pain care adult ED set gather data whether clinical decision support effective improving pain care outcomes ED . The use electronic pain care alert ( ePCA ) prompting doctor provide acute pain care adult patient complaint severe abdominal pain compare patient see clinician routine ED care . Hypothesis : The ePCA improve quality acute pain care patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study compare effectiveness combine electronic pain care alert ( ePCA ) `` pain keycepts '' ( i.e. , embed pain care concepts/algorithms within clinician documentation template ) intervention versus routine care acute pain care outcomes geriatric abdominal pain patient severe pain . Hypothesis : The ePCA pain keycept improve quality acute pain care ( i.e. , Geriatric pain care quality indicator include improve pain evaluation pain treatment ( good pain assessment documentation , early administration analgesic medication , great reduction pain level ) ) geriatric abdominal pain patient severe pain . Study Design : This exploratory randomize trial intervention versus usual clinical care ( control ) . 1 . ( Pre-intervention abdominal pain care baseline ) : Prior implementation ePCA , baseline Epic process pain care measure abdominal pain patient collect 4-month period . Study variable collect determine baseline patient-related abdominal pain care data . Baseline data use two purpose . To determine : 1 . ) improvement quality pain care receive post-intervention 2 . ) treatment diffusion effect control ( routine care ) physicians receive ePCAs ( i.e. , intervention period commence , difference process pain care outcomes find control group versus pre-intervention baseline group ) . 2 . This randomized comparative effectiveness trial gathering pilot data efficacy ePCA improve ED pain care adult severe abdominal pain . To study effect ePCA intervention , alert randomize RESIDENT physician , randomly assign group designate Epic EMR ( electronic medical record ) ( i.e. , alert trigger resident , trigger resident ( usual care ) entire study period ) . Both group equal privilege way ( i.e. , documentation order ) except BPAs integrate intervention vs. control . Investigators blind randomization assignment subject ( resident physician ) blind study aim . Residents always remain initial randomized arm . The unit analysis ED visit . To study impact ePCA pain care outcome , pilot data collect prospective survey abdominal pain patient , automate data report Epic MSDW , medical record review . Eligible subject enrol consent survey discharge ED regard pain score , desire analgesic medication , satisfaction pain care . While evidence Surgical Emergency Medicine ( EM ) literature indicate early analgesia obscure clinical diagnosis , result diagnostic delay , impedes inform consent , clinician may withhold analgesia due continue misguided belief analgesia may mask diagnostic finding invalidate consent . For reason , data also collect whether patient require surgical consultation .</detailed_description>
