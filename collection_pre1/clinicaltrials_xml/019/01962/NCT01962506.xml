	<brief_summary>Rapid reliable exclusion acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) emergency department ( ED ) triage major unmet clinical need . We aim verify non-inferiority single-sampling strategy hs-cTn copeptin compare dual hs-cTn sample early diagnosis Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes ( NSTE-ACS ) versus Non Coronary Chest Pain ( NCCP ) select cohort consecutive patient admit Emergency Department .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The evaluation chest pain patient emergency department remain costly difficult challenge , large proportion suffer acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . The adequate ruling ACS patient chest pain crucial , erroneous discharge patient ACS associate high risk cardiac event . Rapid assessment patient critical direct diagnostic therapeutic strategy . Electrocardiography ( ECG ) cardiac troponin ( cTn ) current diagnostic cornerstone complement clinical assessment current AMI guidelines1 . They allow rule acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) within first 3 hour presentation majority patient offer opportunity initiate appropriate , evidence-based treatment . The vast majority patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) suspect AMI , however , finally prove AMI . The current process ruling AMI time-consuming expensive . One fourth one-third patient AMI present without significant ECG change indicative acute ischemia ; therefore , ECG little help rule AMI , especially set non-ST elevation ACS ( NSTE-ACS ) . High-sensitivity ( h ) -cTn assay develop recently , enable measurement concentration âˆ¼10-fold low previously measurable . Recent study confirm increased accuracy high-sensitivity assay compare conventional assay early detection AMI safely rule coronary cause chest pain . However , concern raise possible specificity deficit new assay . In addition , second measurement hs-cTn may warrant order increase accuracy assay . Copeptin , C-terminal part vasopressin pro-hormone , marker acute endogenous stress , demonstrate useful rapid rule acute myocardial infarction . Current evidence diagnostic validity performance combination high sensitivity-cardiac troponin copeptin limited controversial . A Bayesian probabilistic approach likely correct way evaluate possible incremental value copeptin detection ACS . Thus , aim prospectively evaluate diagnostic accuracy copeptin , hs-cTn , CK-MB myoglobin , alone combination hs-cTn , early diagnosis rule Non-ST-Elevation ( NSTE ) ACS versus non-cardiac cause chest pain select cohort Emergency Department ( ED ) chest pain patient accord pre-test probability , assess combination two validate clinical risk score system ( i.e . Chest Pain Score TIMI Risk Score ) .</detailed_description>
