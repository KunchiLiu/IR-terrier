	<brief_title>To Find Safe Dose Show Early Clinical Activity Weekly Nab-paclitaxel Pediatric Patients With Recurrent/ Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABI-007-PST-001 Phase 1 / 2 , multicenter , open-label , dose-finding study ass safety , tolerability , preliminary efficacy weekly nab-paclitaxel pediatric patient recurrent refractory solid tumor ( exclude brain tumor ) . The Phase 1 portion study , dose escalation design , end recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine 240 mg/m2 IV patient weigh &gt; 10 kg 11.5 mg/kg patient weigh ≤ 10 kg Days 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle . The Phase 2 portion study enroll additional patient RP2D one three solid tumor group [ Neuroblastomas , Rhabdomyosarcomas , Ewing 's Sarcomas ] . Both phase study open-label conduct multiple center .</detailed_description>
