	<detailed_description>Background : Force generation force level control important neuromuscular control mechanism successful execution movement daily activity . Impaired force level control major deficit motor control people stroke . Electromyographic biofeedback ( EMG biofeedback ) suggest researcher clinician useful effective tool enhance control force level motor skill learn people stroke . Based concept motor-skill learning , practice variable force level may effective practice constant force level enhance movement performance . The EMG biofeedback provide suitable tool practice force level control hence motor skill learn . However , research literature thus far yet provide convincing evidence support claim . Neural image study show correspond brain reorganization neural plasticity follow physical practice movement skill people stroke . It curious whether EMG biofeedback augment physical practice motor skill enhance brain reorganization . Using brain mapping technique , particular , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , could investigate neural plasticity accompany motor function change induce physical training , hence may help develop safer effective training parameter . The purpose study examine effect variable practiced EMG biofeedback training emphasize force level control ankle muscle balance gait performance corresponding change corticospinal excitability use TMS people chronic stroke . Study Design Methods : This study single-blind randomize controlled trial . Sixty participant recruit randomly assign one three group : constant practice , variable practice control group . Each participant receive 3 day per week total 6 week EMG biofeedback assist force level control training Tibialis Anterior ( TA ) muscle . For variable practice group , participant practice exertion force output level 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , 25 % maximal TA muscle strength EMG feedback . For constant practice group , goal force level control train 100 % maximal strength . The control group participant practice maximal TA muscle control without EMG feedback . Balance gait-related motor function , TA force control error , TA strength , ankle range motion , calf muscle spasticity , walk speed , Timed Up Go test , Six-minute Walking test , dynamic balance test corticospinal excitability include threshold , latency , recruitment curve TA motor evoke ( MEP ) potential evaluate baseline , post-training , two week train six week train . Statistical Package Social Science ( SPSS ) 13.0 used statistical analysis . Anticipated result : We anticipate three group participant may demonstrate change maximal weight shift amplitude , gait speed corticospinal excitability . However , variable practice group demonstrate ability modify vary force level control balance gait task , reveal correspond change recruitment curve TA MEP .</detailed_description>
