	<brief_summary>Researchers Stanford University School Medicine seek participant study examine effectiveness vasopressin , neuropeptide , treat child autism spectrum disorder . Difficulty social interaction characteristic people autism , often problem interpret facial expression maintain eye contact talk someone . There currently effective medicine available treat social problem individual autism . Neuropeptides , vasopressin oxytocin , molecule use neuron brain communicate one another . Vasopressin closely related oxytocin , currently test treatment autism , show enhance social functioning animal . Animal study show proper function vasopressin experimentally alter , animal develop variety social deficit , include impaired memory peer reduce interest social interaction . Researchers find vasopressin administer mouse genetically induced form autism , social functioning improve . Vasopressin already approve Food Drug Administration use human , prove successful treatment common pediatric condition , include bedwetting . Similar oxytocin , also show improve social cognition memory people autism . The researcher test effect vasopressin social impairment 50 boy girls autism , age 6 12 year old . The study last four week participant . Participants receive either vasopressin placebo nasal spray . At end phase study , receive placebo option participate four-week trial give vasopressin . Stanford site study . Participants need live locally need come Stanford University Department Psychiatry Behavioral Sciences study visit .</brief_summary>
