	<brief_summary>The aim multicentre study well describe clinical characteristic etiological base patient OFD syndrome identify new gene involve OFD syndrome . These result make possible , patient clearly identify clinical , cytogenetic molecular point view , determine study strategy patient . The data obtain use guide clinical geneticist genetic counsel patient family . Identification molecular base different OFD syndrome make possible determine whether belong group ciliopathies like type I OFD understand physiopathological base . This study also make possible good characterise phenotype boys syndromic mental retardation relate OFD1 gene thus define clinical criterion study gene boy mental retardation . The complete absence knowledge concern genetic base OFD syndrome , apart type I , presence large collection sample patient OFD syndrome Dijon CHU , recognition diagnostic laboratory syndromic OFD international level well technical platform expertise molecular cytogenetic method include CGH-array molecular genetics ( sequence , quantitative PCR , fragment analysis ) Cytogenetics Molecular Biology laboratories Dijon CHU justify implementation study 2010 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Group 1 : Study molecular base OFD syndromes Patients sample collect declaration Ministry progress Patients OFD syndrome sample collection DC20091045 declaration Ministry progress , include study . Indeed , blood sample 65 patient send u since 2002 study OFD l gene thanks national international recruitment : 35 present clinical sign less associated mode transmission suggest OFD l syndrome 30 present form OFD ( OFDII , OFDVI , OFDVII , OFDVIII OFDIX ) polymalformative syndrome OFD involvement ( OFD+ ) . We therefore constitute second collection DNA sample 33 patient OFD syndrome polymalformative syndrome OFD involvement , present neither mutation rearrangement OFD1 gene . The clinical data already available Doctor Christel ThauvinRobinet , responsible collection . These patient sign nonopposition form allow use blood sample research OFD syndromes . These patient therefore include new study without need new consent . Only information letter sent ( annexe 4A ) Newlyincluded patient The inclusion criterion patient principally clinical and/or paraclinical , base clinical investigation usually conduct followup patient . Every index case must present OFD syndrome normal result study OFD1 gene direct sequence genomic DNA search major rearrangement use quantitative PCR . The index case could child ( birth onwards ) adult , male female sporadic familial syndrome . Patients recruit clinical investigator study . These patient could : patient already know investigator , contact patient invite take part research , new patient see consultation first year study ( inclusion period ) The clinical dossier accompanies sample include case report form , family tree , photographs patient sign write informed consent form Symptomatic asymptomatic relative may also include study , write informed consent provide , exclude polymorphism use CGHarray molecular biology , confirm segregation mutation . Minors include study symptomatic . All take part research , whether patient healthy asymptomatic relative cover national health insurance agency . Group 2 : Study form syndromic Xlinked mental retardation secondary mutation OFD1 gene Preexisting patient cohort Two different type population could include : Boys Joubert syndrome cerebellar hypoplasia origin `` molar tooth '' sign cerebral MRI negative result mutation gene involve Joubert syndrome describe Doctor Burglen ( Hospital Trousseau , APHP ) Boys phenotype could link mutation OFD1 gene : A cohort boys polydactyly+/ juvenile retinitis pigmentosa obesity screen negative BBS gene mutation recruit Professor Dollfus ( CHU Strasbourg ) A cohort male severe macrocephaly ( &gt; +4SD ) negative screen mutation GPC3 gene recruit Doctor Rossignol ( CHU Trousseau , Paris ) Doctor Raynaud ( CHU Tours ) . A cohort males recurrent pulmonary infection , macrocephaly ( &gt; +4SD ) negative screen mutation MECP2 gene recruit Doctor Philippe ( CHU Nancy ) , Doctor Badens ( CHU Marseille ) , Professor Bieth ( CHU Toulouse ) Professor Touraine ( CHU St Etienne ) . The clinical dossier accompanies DNA sample include case report form , family tree , photographs patient sign write informed consent form Newlyincluded patient The inclusion criterion patient principally clinical and/or paraclinical , base clinical investigation usually conduct followup patient . All index case male must present : ( 1 ) Joubert syndrome normal result gene responsible Joubert syndrome ( 3 ) syndromic mental retardation less associated polydactyly , obesity , macrocephaly , pigmentary retinopathy , recurrent infection and/or `` molar tooth '' sign cerebral MRI . Index case could infants ( birth onwards ) adult , sporadic familial case mode transmission compatible Xlinked inheritance . Patients recruit clinical investigator study . These patient could : patient already know investigator , contact patient invite take part research , new patient see consultation first year study ( inclusion period ) The clinical dossier accompanies sample include case report form , family tree , photographs patient sign write informed consent form Symptomatic asymptomatic relative may also include study , write informed consent provide , exclude polymorphism use CGHarray molecular biology , confirm segregation mutation . Minors include study symptomatic . All take part research , whether patient healthy asymptomatic relative cover national health insurance agency . Exclusion criterion : Patients exclude study clinical data meet criterion define . Patients OFD syndrome sequence exon exonintron junction OFD1 gene genomic DNA search major rearrangement quantitative PCR identify causal mutation include study . The following patient also exclude study : wish provide blood sample , provide write informed consent , without national health insurance , custody following legal administrative decision .</criteria>
