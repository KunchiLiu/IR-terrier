	<criteria>Patients must great 12 month le 50 year age time study enrollment . Patients must histologic verification extracranial germ cell tumor pure mature teratoma . Patients must sufficient tumor tissue available allow assessment EGFR mTOR pathway activation ( see Section 5.2.3 sample requirement ) Patients must relapse refractory disease follow least two prior cisplatin contain chemotherapy regimen . Patients must measurable disease , document accord RECIST criterion , evaluable disease standard tumor marker ( AFP and/or HCG ) great 10 time upper limit normal . Patients must Lansky Karnofsky performance status score ≥ 50 . Use Karnofsky patient &gt; 16 year age Lansky patient ≤ 16 year age . Patients must life expectancy great 8 week . Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior anticancer therapy . Patients must receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy within 3 week enrollment . Patients must &gt; 7 day since treatment hematopoetic growth factor ( &gt; 14 day Neulasta ) . Patients must &gt; 7 day since therapy biologic agent beyond period adverse event biologic agent know occur longer . Patients must &gt; 3 halflives since therapy monoclonal antibody . Patients must &gt; 42 day since completion immunotherapy ( i.e . tumor vaccine ) . Patients must great 2 week since recent palliative XRT great 6 week since substantial bone marrow irradiation . Patients must great 8 week since prior stem cell transplant infusion without evidence active graft vs. host disease . Adequate bone marrow function define : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) least 1,000/ L Platelet count least 100,000/ L ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7day period prior enrollment ) Hemoglobin 8.0 g/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) . Adequate renal function define : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 Maximum serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) base age/gender Adequate liver function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN ( purpose study , ULN SGPT 45 U/L ) Serum albumin ≥ 2 g/dL . Adequate central nervous system function define : Patients seizure disorder may enrol receive nonenzyme inducing anticonvulsant well control . Serum cholesterol level must less Grade 2 ( &lt; 300 mg/dL ) , serum triglyceride level must less Grade 2 ( &lt; 2.5 x ULN ) . Patients active brain metastasis eligible lethal intratumoral hemorrhage report erlotinib therapy . Patients brain metastasis treat stable &gt; 30 day follow treatment eligible . Patients pregnant breast feed enter study erlotinib teratogenic . Pregnancy test must obtain female postmenarchal . Postmenarchal females HCG secrete tumor exclude pregnancy ca n't exclude . Males females reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method duration study . Concomitant medication Investigational Drugs : Patients currently receive another investigational drug eligible . Anticancer Agents : Patients currently receive anticancer agent eligible . Anticonvulsants : Patients receive enzymeinducing anticonvulsant eligible ( see Appendix 1 list enzyme induce anticonvulsant ) . Anticoagulants : Use warfarin allow study . Patients already warfarin use alternative anticoagulant study . Warfarin must administer within 7 day enrollment . Smoking : Smoking induces CYP3A4/5 enzymes decrease exposure sirolimus erlotinib . Thus , patient must smoke 10 day prior enrollment duration therapy . Infection : Patients uncontrolled infection eligible . Drug interaction : Sirolimus erlotinib primarily metabolize CYP3A4/5 enzymes . Drug exposure substantially effect CYP inhibitor ( increased exposure ) inducer ( decreased exposure ) . Thus , concomitant administration strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor inducer prohibit therapy . See Appendix 1 list medication . Patients must receive medication minimum 10 day prior enrollment . Patients receive prior therapy target EGFR small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor monoclonal antibody NOT eligible . Prior treatment mTOR TORC1/2 inhibitor ( eg , rapamycin , temsirolimus , everolimus , deferolimus ) NOT allow . Patients major surgery within 3 week prior enrollment eligible . Procedures placement central vascular catheter , limited tumor biopsy , consider major surgery . Patients opinion investigator may able comply safety monitoring requirement study eligible .</criteria>
