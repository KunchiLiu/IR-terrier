	<brief_summary>This open label , randomize , 3-way cross-over , repeat administration study healthy male female subject . The purpose study determine relative bioavailability Fluticasone Furoate ( FF ) Levocabastine ( LEV ) , administer alone FF/LEV Fixed Dose Combination ( FDC ) .This study consist Part A ( 30 subject include 12 Korean subject enrol ) Part B ( 18 subject enrol ) . Each part consist three treatment period separate minimum washout period 14 day . In treatment period , subject receive seven daily dose one 3 treatment : FF , LEV FF/LEV FDC , via intranasal spray accord one 6 possible randomization sequence . The study use adaptive design interim review follow Part A confirm whether Part B require .</brief_summary>
