	<brief_summary>The treatment bipolar disorder always challenge daily practice . Mood stabilizer partially effective treatment depressive phase illness , although report relate antidepressant property drug . Other conventional method ( pharmacological ) non- conventional treatment effective involve risk side effect . Several study Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) show magnetic stimulation daily leave prefrontal cortex may improve mood patient . TMS noninvasive method stimulate brain . The instrument use nowadays local research application Clinical metallic coil form figure 8 ( coil format 8 ) . This instrument capable stimulate surface area brain , primarily cerebral cortex , depths 3 inch scalp . From angle , clearly need mean produce magnetic field reach deep brain area , involve mood disorder . TMS little , effect brain area . To end , new coil , call `` H '' , promote stimulation deep brain area develop collaboration National Institute Health ( NIH ) USA . This new coil - H1 evaluate study test safety NIH 2003 Dr. Abraham Zangen . Yet prospective clinical , randomize controlled trial , effect early late clinical-cognitive condition safety TMS H1 coil treat episode bipolar depression . The application EMT H1 coil reach deep region brain improve clinical cognitive condition subject episodes bipolar depression , may confirm safe virtually free side effect . By absence treatment actually effective bipolar depression , study show whether clinical cognitive benefit deep TMS H1 coil patient bipolar depression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Bipolar Depression With H1-Coil Deep Brain rTMS : Clinical-Cognitive Safety Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present research protocol evaluate clinical-cognitive safety effect H1-Coil Deep Brain Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation prefrontal cortex subject bipolar depression , currently treat mood stabilizer and/or antipsychotic stabilization sleep regulation . Patients clinically evaluate Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders 5th Edition ( DSM-5 ) criterion Bipolar Depressive Episode . Symptoms intensity rat accord The Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAMD -17 item ) - main outcome . Patients score high 18 include cognitives function evaluate accord task neuropsychologic battery chosen . Patients active neurological severe disorder ( cancer , auto-imune cardiologic disorder ) exclude . The present study double-blinded , control , randomize trial 50 patient bipolar depression episode . The intervention protocol consist 20 consecutive daily deep TMS session ( skip weekend ) . After meet eligibility criterion , patient randomize ( computer generate list ) one two intervention group : 25 patient Active H1-Coil deep brain rTMS group Sham H1-Coil deep brain rTMS group . H1-Coil deep brain rTMS session follow follow step : first day treatment , patient instruct wear earplug minimize risk impair hearing . Then , threshold intensity stimulation motor determine apply pulse motor cortex . The stimulation threshold determine pro gradually increase stimulation intensity every 5 second . The stimulation threshold define stimulation lesser intensity evoke motor potential least 50μV amplitude least 5 tentativas.A coil position 5 centimeter hot spot ( prefrontal area ) intensity - 120 % threshold engine . Each session receive 55 group stimuli , duration - 2/2 , frequency - 18 Hz , area - leave prefrontal , interval - 20 second . Soon , 1,980 pulse magnetic stimulation administer every day ( per session ) , total 39,600 pulse throughout treatment . Patients clinically assessed baseline , weekly four week treatment four week completion treatment end 8 week . Main outcome base HAMD-17 item endpoint 4-weeks follow 4-weeks , secondary outcome assess Young Mania Rating Scale ( 11 item ) 8 week . Other evaluation scale include , Hamilton Anxiety Scale , Global Assessment Scale Clinical Global Impression 8 week . The cognitive assessment perform neuropsychologic battery test baseline , endpoint 4-weeks endpoint 8-weeks trained neuropsychologist . Also Safety Deep rTMS Scale , adverse effect scale clinical evaluation train physician .</detailed_description>
