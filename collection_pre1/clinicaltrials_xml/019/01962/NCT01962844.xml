	<detailed_description>The universe patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) increase steadily worldwide . And associate intimately certain cardiovascular risk factor dyslipidemia , decrease HDL-C , hypertension , diabetes mellitus obesity . The quality fat diet influence incidence obesity dyslipidemia . A high intake saturate fat different population associate elevated serum cholesterol concentration cardiovascular mortality . However , study show extra virgin coconut oil ( Cocos nucifera L. ) despite characterize high content saturate fat associate obesity dyslipidemia population high consumption . And due high proportion medium chain triglyceride , especially lauric acid proportion range 45-50 % , presence factor antioxidant like vitamin E polyphenols . Our hypothesis extra virgin coconut oil associate nutritional treatment effect weight reduction control dyslipidemia contributes control secondary prevention patient coronary artery disease . All participant inform research must sign consent form . Volunteers divide two group : group receive dietary treatment 6 month beyond dietary treatment 6 month start receive supplementation coconut oil extra virgin 3 month , group evaluate monthly . At visit , weight assessment , compliance diet blood pressure measurement perform . In addition , blood also collect determination glucose , insulin , total cholesterol , LDL-cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol , triglyceride , apolipoprotein A B . The result analyze statistical program.It expect result obtain , extra virgin coconut oil use couple secondary prevention patient coronary artery disease.Our hypothesis extra virgin coconut oil associate nutritional treatment effect weight reduction control dyslipidemia contributes control secondary prevention patient coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
