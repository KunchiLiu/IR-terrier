	<brief_summary>Introduction : Closure hernia gap laparoscopic ventral hernia repair mesh reinforcement gain increase acceptance among surgeon despite create tension-based repair . Beneficial effect technique sporadically report evidence available randomize controlled trial . The primary purpose compare early postoperative activity-related pain patient undergoing ventral hernia repair closure gap patient undergo standard laparoscopic ventral hernia repair ( non-closure gap ) . Secondary outcome cosmesis hernia-related quality life ( QoL ) 30-days clinical radiological recurrence chronic pain 2 year . Material Methods : A randomized , control , double-blinded study plan . Based power calculation include 40 patient arm . Patients undergo elective laparoscopic umbilical , epigastric , umbilical trocar-site hernia repair Hvidovre Hospital , Herlev Hospital , KÃ¸ge Hospital , meet inclusion criterion , invite participate . Conclusion : The technique closure gap may induce postoperative pain , may superior regard important surgical outcome . No study previously investigate closure gap set randomise control trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion Elective , primary recurrent laparoscopic umbilical epigastric hernia repair , umbilical trocarsite hernia epigastric hernia repair laparoscopic hernia repair contraindication ( i.e . previous laparotomy anticipate severe dense adhesion Hernia defect 26 cm measure preoperatively surgeon outpatient clinic Maximum 1 defect Patients 1880 year Patients technical failure ( possible suture defect ) patient reoperated due complication remain included stay primary assigned randomization group order perform intention treat ( ITT ) analysis . Open hernia repair Poor compliance ( language problem , dementia alcohol drug abuse etc . ) Fascia defect &gt; 6 cm ( large diameter , evaluate preoperatively intraoperatively , thus patient exclude defect find large intraoperatively ) Emergency repair Chronic pain syndrome ( chronic back pain , chronic headache , severe dysmenorrhea , fibromyalgia , whiplash condition require daily opioid medication ) Daily consumption opioids ( last 3 week till operation ) Decompensated liver cirrhosis ( ChildPugh BC ) If hernia repair secondarily another surgical procedure If patient withdraws his/her inclusion consent</criteria>
