	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics JNJ-42756493 Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) , multicenter , 2-part , Phase 1 dose escalation/expansion evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( study body drug ) , pharmacodynamics ( study drug body ) clinical activity JNJ-42756493 administer orally daily 21-day cycle 28 day cycle intermittent dose regimen ( 7 day on/7 day ) Japanese Asian participant &gt; =20 year age advance refractory solid tumor lymphoma candidate approve available therapy . Approximately 40 participant enrol . In Part 1 Participants require hospitalize first dose Day 1 Cycle 1 Day 2 Cycle 2 ( daily continuous dose ) Day 14 Cycle 1 ( intermittent dosing ) , however extension hospitalization allow Day 2 Cycle 2 accord investigator clinical judgment . The Part 1 dose-escalation phase design determine recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) base safety , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic data JNJ-42756493 . Participants enrol sequential cohort base 3+3 dose-escalation scheme ; first cohort receive start dose subsequent cohort receive increase dos JNJ-42756493 . After last participant cohort completes Cycle 1 , Safety Evaluation Team ( SET ) evaluate safety pharmacokinetic data accord protocol-defined criterion make decision whether escalate dose new cohort . To determine recommended Phase 2 dose , SET review safety , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic data Part 1 initiation Part 2 . The total number participant enrol Part 1 depend dose level recommend Phase 2 dose establish . After recommended Phase 2 dose establish , Part 2 dose-expansion phase open . Part 2 study do molecularly-defined subset Participants gastric adenocarcinoma include gastroesophageal junction RP2D . In Part2 , Participants hospitalize Day 8 Cycle 1 need . In addition , extension hospitalization allow Day 15 Cycle 1 accord investigator 's clinical judgment . In Part 2 , approximately 25 participant treat recommended Phase 2 dose 28 day cycle intermittent dose regimen order evaluate fibroblast growth factor receptor target modulation tumor , elaborate safety , pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics JNJ-42756493 , well evaluate preliminary clinical response . Participants tolerate study drug treatment achieve clinical response stable disease continue receive study drug dose disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Serial pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic sample collect , safety efficacy monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
