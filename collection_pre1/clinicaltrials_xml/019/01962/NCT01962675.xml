	<brief_summary>The study investigate effect use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) skilled step train versus skilled step train sham-tDCS improve ankle leg motor control person ambulatory person spinal cord injury . Hypotheses H1 : Participants display great improvement step function follow tDCS combine training compare sham-tDCS training . H2 : Participants display great gain cortical excitability , evidence low cortico-motor threshold ( MT ) associate TA muscle follow tDCS training compare follow sham stimulation training . H3 : Participants tDCS+training group show great increase walk speed time 10 meter walk trial . H4 : Participants tDCS+training group show able perform great number toe-taps test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An estimated 265,000 individual live consequence SCI United States alone . Individuals motor incomplete spinal cord injury ( MISCI ) commonly experience loss impairment low extremity function . There limited number option restoration walk function individual motor-incomplete spinal cord injury ( MISCI ) exhibit ability stand walk may impede impaired voluntary control lower limb particularly , ankle . In person spinal cord injury , walk function often limited poor ability lift advance leg . Lower extremity orthotic device may employ stabilize ankle joint provide toe clearance walking . However , device cumbersome , may aesthetically unappealing . Newer evidence indicate non-invasive approach brain stimulation may provide way improve voluntary control legs ankle person neurologic disorder . Purpose research study : The overall goal study develop functional rehabilitation strategy facilitate optimal restoration leg ankle motor control individual MISCI . Individuals MISCI exhibit motor function level lesion include American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale ( AIS ) classification AIS C AIS D. We propose test non-invasive cortical stimulation combination lower-extremity functional motor training ability assist improve fine motor control lower limbs individual MISCI . Studies show non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) increase activity specific cortical area associate motor learning , therefore improve cortical functional effect associate motor practice training individual SCI . If brain stimulation combination motor training find enhance improvement control effectively motor train alone , would provide basis examine stimulation combine low limb joint therapy individual spinal cord injury . Objectives : To Assess improvement low extremity motor control associate bilateral tDCS functional motor training sham tDCS functional motor training individual motor incomplete spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
