	<brief_summary>The effect neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA , e.g . rocuronium ) respiratory muscle activity well know . However , since availability sugammadex , knowledge , study conduct evaluate effect novel product muscle . Our hypothesis apply different strategy use neuromuscular block agent reversal agent might see different activity respiratory muscle .</brief_summary>
