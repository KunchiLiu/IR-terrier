	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Treatment Auditory Hallucinations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Auditory hallucination ( AH ) symptom several psychiatric disorder , schizophrenia . In majority patient , AH respond well antipsychotic medication . Yet , significant minority continue experience frequent AH despite optimal pharmacotherapy AH severely decrease quality life patient . The number alternative treatment option medication resistant group currently low focus cop hallucination . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , contrast , safe , non-invasive technique able directly influence cortical excitability application low electric current . This technique transient side-effects cheap portable . To date , one randomize control trial publish , suggest high efficacy tDCS treatment medication-resistant AH relatively small sample . We aim replicate extend finding investigate efficacy technique large sample .</detailed_description>
