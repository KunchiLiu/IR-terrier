	<brief_summary>This study aim test new groundbreaking treatment narrow voicebox upper windpipe , due injury , inflammatory disease cancer treatment . Narrowing voicebox upper windpipe leave patient dependant tracheostomy tube breath ( tube hole neck ) , require high level care regular hospital visit lead recurrent chest infection . Regular surgical procedure may necessary widen airway . Speaking may difficult even possible , breathe usually struggle swallow also affect . Patients feel tired time . The new treatment test study implant partially replace voicebox upper windpipe order cure narrowing . The implant base human donor voicebox windpipe process detergent enzyme order remove cell donor , leave 'scaffold ' connective tissue . The patient 's stem cell remove bone marrow , grown scaffold laboratory . These cell form cartilage wall scaffold . A split skin graft patient may need line inside implant . The implant consider 'living ' due cell grow , type treatment refer 'tissue engineering ' 'regenerative medicine ' . Once cell attach start grow scaffold , ready implant patient , operation perform occurs two separate stage . The final stage operation involve remove narrow section voicebox upper windpipe implant scaffold reconstruct . Patients follow two year operation , investigation CT scan , examination voicebox windpipe flexible camera ( bronchoscopy ) blood test perform specific time . It intend treatment significantly improve patient ' symptom result well breathing , swallow voice function , reduce need repeat hospital visit procedure enhance patient ' quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Stem Cell Based Tissue Engineered Laryngeal Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The RegenVOX trial phase I/IIa safety potential efficacy clinical trial tissue-engineered laryngotracheal replacement use autologous-derived cell decellularised human donor scaffold 10 patient severe acquire laryngotracheal stenosis . Current solution treatment advance structural disorder larynx trauma , inflammatory disorder follow cancer treatment suboptimal patient problem require frequent hospitalisation . A regenerative solution restores anatomy larynx would provide definitive treatment patient , improve outcome resection malignant disease , avoid laryngectomy would reduce threshold perform surgery administer chemotherapy thereby reduce morbidity . Giving patient once-only therapy life-time functional living replacement would allow patient lead tracheostomy-free life improve breathing , swallow speech lower requirement hospital follow-up . This project clinical trial tissue engineer partial laryngeal replacement 10 patient end-stage laryngeal stenosis . The intervention base human donor graft scaffold decellularised seed autologous mesenchymal stem cell-derived chondrocytes externally . Following expansion cell ex-vivo , graft implant . This first clinical trial knowledge stem-call base organ replacement . Inclusion criterion : Patients age &gt; =18 year sufficient number Mesenchymal Stromal Cells ( MSCs ) human Bone Marrow ( hBM ) aspirate . Patients Myer-Cotton Grade 3 4 laryngotracheal stenosis malacia due traumatic , inflammatory , iatrogenic , idiopathic cause exhaust conventional therapy . Exclusion criterion : Pregnancy . Patients positive HIV 1 , HIV 2 , Hepatitis C ( HCV ) , Hepatitis B ( HBV ) , syphilis Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus ( HTLV ) . Those unable provide inform consent . Co-morbid severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( accord NICE criterion ) Patients active / uncontrolled chronic inflammatory condition granulomatosis polyangitis ( formerly Wegener 's granulomatosis ) sarcoidosis . Any current previous cancer within 5 year ( except non-melanoma skin cancer , adequately treat carcinoma situ uterine cervix , laryngeal malignancy treat locally local recurrence metastasis , low grade airway malignancy chondrosarcoma may cause airway obstruction ) . Life expectancy le 5 year unless limitation principally due airway obstruction treat . Concurrent enrollment Clinical Trial Investigational Medicinal Product ( CTIMP ) . The primary outcome measure safety determine morbidity mortality measure occurrence adverse event . Secondary outcome efficacy determine 1 . Absence tracheostomy . 2 . Absence non-absorbable stent . 3 . Improvement mean airway diameter . 4 . Improvement Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) . 5 . Improvement global quality life ( EQ-5D ) . 6 . Improvement maximum phonation time ( MPT ) measure Voice Analysis Operavox ( VAO ) . 7 . Improvement self assessment voice handicap ( VHI-10 ) . 8 . Improvement swallow function ( EAT-10 ) . 9 . Improvement airway , dyspnoea , voice , swallow index ( ADVS index ) . 10 . Improvement penetration-aspiration scale ( PAS ) per Video Fluoroscopic Swallow ( VFS ) Functional Endoscopic Evaluation Swallowing ( FEES ) . Health economics . Patients follow 2 year within study . Key milestone assess 6 12 month . The follow-up regimen include bronchoscopy airway brushing take 1 week post implantation full physical assessment include CT imaging , pulmonary function test , blood test bronchoscopy 1 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month . Telephone follow-up take place assessment . This trial provide level insight real clinical potential stem cell/tissue engineering combined technology . The result wide implication development hollow organ- replacement oesophagus , bowel vascular disorder . We also develop new pathway maximise discovery science health economic benefit complex regenerative medicine therapy ( reverse translational route map ) , important generic benefit scientist clinician .</detailed_description>
