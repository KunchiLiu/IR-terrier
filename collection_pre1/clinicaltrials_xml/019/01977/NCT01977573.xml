	<brief_summary>This study conduct approximately 228 subject anemia associate CKD dialysis . Two group subject enrol study : Group 1 : recombinant human erythropoietin ( rhEPO ) naive subject ; Group 2 : rhEPO user , currently receive rhEPO . Subjects rhEPO naive randomize receive either GSK1278863 daily ( QD ) rhEPO 3:1 fashion ; subject receive rhEPO enrolling ( rhEPO user ) randomize 1:1 fashion GSK1278863 QD control arm . For randomized control arm , decision around whether subject require rhEPO , selection type rhEPO ( need ) choice rhEPO dose achieve maintain Hgb concentration within target range base Investigator clinical judgment , historical rhEPO dose current Hgb value consider . The study consist screen phase least 4 week , 24-week treatment phase follow-up visit occur approximately 4 week complete treatment . It anticipate data generate enable selection start dose ( ) optimize dose adjustment regimen ( ) Phase 3 clinical trial .</brief_summary>

( Week 4 verification ) Females : If childbearing potential , must agree use one approve contraception method , Screening completion Followup Visit OR Of nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , hysterectomy , oophorectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one approve contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) : Bazett 's Correction QT Interval ( QTcB ) &lt; 470 millisecond ( msec ) QTcB &lt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block . There QTc criterion subject predominantly pace rhythm . CKD stage : Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( KDOQI ) CKD stag 3/4/5 defined electronic estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) use CKD Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKDEPI ) formula . Hgb : Group 1 ( rhEPO na√Øve ) : Baseline Hgb 8.011.0 g/dL ( inclusive ) ( USA sit : 8.010.0 g/dL , inclusive ) ; Group 2 ( rhEPO user ) : Baseline Hgb 9.011.5 g/dL ( inclusive ) ( USA sit : 9.010.5 , inclusive ) . Stable rhEPO dose rhEPO user : Group 2 subject must use rhEPO ( epoetins biosimilars , darbepoetin ) total weekly dos vary 50 % 4 week prior Week 4 . At Day 1 ( randomization ) , confirm total weekly dos vary 50 % screening period . Oral iron therapy : If oral iron , dose must change 4 week prior Week 4 , screen phase , first 4 week Randomization . Dialysis : On dialysis planning initiate dialysis study . Renal transplant : Preemptive schedule renal transplant . High rhEPO dose : An epoetin dose &gt; =360 IU/kg/week intravenous ( IV ) &gt; =250 IU/kg/week subcutaneous ( SC ) darbepoetin dose &gt; =1.8 microgram per kilogram per week ( mcg/kg/week ) IV SC within prior 8 week Day 1 ( randomization ) . Use methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta within prior 8 week Day 1 ( randomization ) . IV iron therapy : Use IV iron 4 week prior Screening Week 4 , screen phase , first 4 week Randomization Vitamin B12 : Below low limit reference range ( may rescreen minimum 8 week ) . Folate : &lt; 2.0 nanogram per millilitre ( ng/mL ) ( &lt; 4.5 nanomoles per liter [ nmol/L ] ) ( may rescreen minimum 4 week ) . Ferritin : &lt; 40 ng/mL ( &lt; 40 mcg/L ) . Transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) : Below low limit reference range Myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome : Within 8 week prior Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Stroke transient ischemic attack : Within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Heart failure : Class III/IV heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) , symptomatic right heart failure diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Uncontrolled hypertension : Defined diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 100 mmHg systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 170 mmHg Week 4 reconfirm Day 1 . Thrombotic Disease : History thrombotic disease ( e.g. , venous thrombosis deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , arterial thrombosis new onset worsen limb ischemia require intervention ) , except vascular access thrombosis within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Ophthalmology disease : Meeting ophthalmologicrelated exclusion criterion determine Screening ophthalmology exam . Inflammatory disease : Active chronic inflammatory disease could impact erythropoiesis ( e.g. , scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease ) diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Hematological disease : Any hematological disease include affect platelet , white red blood cell ( e.g . sickle cell anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , hematological malignancy , myeloma , hemolytic anemia thalassemia ) , coagulation disorder ( e.g. , antiphospholipid syndrome , Protein C S deficiency ) , cause anemia renal disease diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Liver disease : Current liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) evidence Screening abnormal liver function test [ alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &gt; 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ] ; hepatic abnormality opinion investigator would preclude subject participation study . Major surgery : Major surgery ( exclude vascular access surgery ) within prior 8 week , Week 4 Screening phase plan study . Transfusion : Blood transfusion within prior 8 week , Week 4 Screening phase anticipate need blood transfusion study . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Bleeding : Evidence actively bleed peptic , duodenal , esophageal ulcer disease OR clinically significant GI bleeding within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) .
