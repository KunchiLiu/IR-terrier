	<detailed_description>Around 20 per cent patient acute pancreatitis develop pancreatic peripancreatic necrosis without peripancreatic collection . Sterile necrosis generally manage conservatively mortality rate relatively low ( 12 per cent ) . Approximately 30 ( range 14-62 ) per cent patient necrotizing pancreatitis , however , develop secondary infection peripancreatic fluid collection associate sepsis organ failure indication intervention1 . Until recently , first-choice intervention patient infect necrotizing pancreatitis sterile necrosis clinical deterioration ( multiple organ failure ) open surgical necrosectomy . This approach associate considerable morbidity ( 34-95 per cent ) mortality ( 11-39 per cent ) . In 1998 , Freeny colleagues10 first describe consecutive series patient infected pancreatic necrosis treat primarily imaging-guided percutaneous catheter drainage ( PCD ) , alternative primary surgical necrosectomy . The rationale PCD drain infect fluid tension gain time improve organ function critically ill patient thereby delay avoid surgical necrosectomy . In retrospective cohort study , PCD successful postpone surgical intervention median 4 week even obviate need surgical necrosectomy almost half patient . In addition , PCD seem technically feasible vast majority patient necrotizing pancreatitis . In clinical experience , investigator find PCD successfully drain liquefied component pancreatic necrosis solid component still remain undrained . This infected solid component pancreatic necrosis probably responsible failure PCD demand surgical debridement . Streptokinase protein secrete several specie streptococci bind activate human plasminogen . It primarily use clinical practice intravenously effective thrombolytic agent case myocardial infarction pulmonary thromboembolism . The early report intracavitatory use Streptokinase fibrinolytics empyemas . Later beneficial result , intracavitatory use extend condition like liver , retroperitoneal peritoneal abscess . In phase II study , intracavitatory urokinase show facilitate percutaneous drainage significantly reduce hospital stay cost percutaneous drainage intra abdominal , retroperitoneal abscess . In present study investigator plan instill streptokinase locally collection patient severe acute pancreatitis via pigtail catheter inorder liquefy solid necrotic component analyze whether hastens drainage thereby delay obviate need necrosectomy .</detailed_description>
