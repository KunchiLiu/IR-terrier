	<brief_summary>Stargardt disease currently incurable untreatable macular dystrophy cause severe visual loss child young adult , thereby cause enormous morbidity economic , psychological , emotional , social implication . There FDA approve therapeutic treatment disease . Therefore , objective study collect natural history data large population child adult order evaluate possible efficacy measure plan clinical trial . Participants recruit Investigator 's patient population study require availability multiyear retrospective data , well ongoing prospectively collect data . A concurrent ancillary study ( SMART study ) also conduct subset prospective study patient regular ProgSTAR study visit expand collection retinal image include microperimetry measurement gather scotopic ( low light ) condition .</brief_summary>
