	<brief_summary>The purpose study study well use powder form antibiotic , vancomycin , inside surgery wound prevents infection patient undergo instrumented spinal surgery traumatic injury back . Vancomycin approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat certain kind bacteria . It also use prevent infection surgery site . This study experimental treatment compare standard ( control ) treatment . It prospective nature , mean follow patient forward time , consist randomization process determine receive experimental treatment versus standard ( control ) treatment . The study take place Regional Medical Center ( The MED ) . 140 subject participate study . The investigator hypothesize topical use powder vancomycin decrease rate surgical site infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : The purpose study examine efficacy prophylactic , locally apply vancomycin powder surgical site infection patient undergo posterior instrument spinal surgery traumatic injury . 2 . Rationale : Surgical site infection ( SSI ) morbid complication high cost management surgical spine patient . In era healthcare reform , adjuvant therapy improve quality , also decrease cost , consider high value . Despite use prophylactic systemic antibiotic improved surgical technique , surgical site infection remain serious perioperative concern . In comparison systemic antibiotic , local delivery antibiotic attractive high concentration achieve directly sit systemic toxicity limit . Prior investigation primarily focus treatment infected wound local antibiotic . Only study analyze prophylactic use local antibiotic spine surgery . To date , prospective , randomized study prophylactic use local antibiotic . The investigator introduce local vancomycin powder practice instrument posterior spinal fusion traumatic spine injury determine efficacy prevent postoperative infection . 3 . Study Population : The study consist adult patient undergo posterior , instrumented spine surgery traumatic injury . 4 . Research Design : This prospective , randomize , control trial . The study primarily carry University Tennessee Health Science Center spinal surgery take place Regional Medical Center Memphis . Once patient traumatic spine injury deem eligible several criterion describe later application , place one two randomized group : 1 ) The control group consist patient administer systemic prophylactic antibiotic . 2 ) The treatment group consist patient administer systemic prophylactic antibiotic along vancomycin powder within surgical site . 5 . Study/Project Procedures : Patients meet entry criterion agree participate trial randomize receive intraoperative vancomycin powder within surgical wound . In patient , vancomycin 1g cefazolin 2g IV give within 60min skin incision . If allergy cefazolin exists , 900mg clindamycin IV use place . Cefazolin 1g IV give q6hr surgery continue q8hr post surgery 24hrs , regardless whether surgical drain place . One three liter normal saline use irrigation purpose surgical procedure . Prior wound closure , vancomycin powder topically apply ( 50 % dose ) ( 50 % dose ) deep muscular fascia patient participate treatment arm study . For surgery involve 3 contiguous spinal segment less , 500mg vancomycin ( 1/2 vial ) apply . For surgery involve great 3 contiguous spinal segment , 1gm apply . 6 . Outcome Measures : All patient follow inpatient outpatient basis ( applicable ) period 12 month post-operatively . Residents , attending study coordinator perform data collection . All patient suspect wound infection undergo MRI contrast verification , unless gross evidence infection ( ex . purulent drainage incision , erythema swell ) . A CT scan contrast obtain patient unable undergo MRI various reason ( pacemaker , metallic foreign body , fresh vascular stent , etc. ) . All wound data collect record specific data form clinical encounter .</detailed_description>
