	<brief_title>Exercise Intervention Study Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The randomized-controlled balanced-parallel-group trial include 65 adult pancreatic cancer patient ( stage I-IV ) University Surgery Clinic Heidelberg . The study compare two specific exercise intervention one standard care control arm . The intervention program ( 1 ) 6-month supervised moderate-to-high-intensity , progressive resistance training , ( 2 ) 6-month home-based exercise training . Thus , two intervention differ primarily intensity mode-of-administration intervention . Both intervention start early 8 week surgery allow wound heal Maximum 12 month surgery . The supervised progressive training start moderate-intensity training first 4 week . Only patient without comorbidities preclude participation intervention arm ( e.g . severe pain , heart insufficiency , reduce stand walk ability ) eligible . The primary objective compare effect different intervention physical functioning , measure change baseline 6 month . Additional endpoint overall quality life , fatigue , endurance , strength performance , adherence intervention , discontinuation adjuvant therapy , body weight composition , disease progression , overall progression-free survival . All outcome assess every 3 month minimum follow-up period 12 month .</detailed_description>
