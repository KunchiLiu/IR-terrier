	<brief_summary>Mechanisms typically result increased cardiac output , inotropic support , increase heart rate , decrease afterload , blunt effect Fontan circulation . The `` thoracic pump '' contributor venous return largely unexplored patient Fontan physiology . Inspiratory muscle training improve performance competitive athlete across range sport improve quality life functional capacity heart failure patient , presumably reduce inspiratory muscle fatigue possibly improve peripheral blood flow exercise . One could surmise effect change would particularly important Fontan population . The investigator propose study effect inspiratory muscle training exercise pulmonary function parameter cohort adult Fontan patient . The investigator hypothesize 12-week program inspiratory muscle train inspiratory impedance threshold device improve inspiratory muscle strength endurance , translate improve exercise performance patient Fontan physiology .</brief_summary>
