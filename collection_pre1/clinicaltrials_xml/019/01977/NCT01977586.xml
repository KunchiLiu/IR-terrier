	<detailed_description>Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) highly vascularize tumour dependent new vessel formation ( angiogenesis ) growth spread beyond kidney ( metastasis ) . In recent year new class drug develop target formation blood supply , stop tumour growth result increase survival . These anti-angiogenic drug Sunitinib , Pazopanib , Axitinib Everolimus standard care metastatic RCC ( mRCC ) United Kingdom . Currently ass cancer respond treatment look change size tumour metastasis use computed tomography . However , positive effect drug sunitinib always show change size , particularly early treatment . Therefore need develop alternative method assess patient respond order optimise individual management plan prevent unnecessary toxicity cost . The aim study assess three different functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques able predict patient derive benefit anti-angiogenic therapy early treatment . The study recruit patient mRCC go treat anti-angiogenic drug . These patient MRI scan commence treatment scan one treatment cycle ( 4 week ) addition normal clinical follow-up . The sequence evaluate ( arterial spin labeling , diffusion-weighted image dynamic contrast imaging ) look blood supply cancer expect different change blood supply patient benefit treatment compare respond . Early knowledge response help doctor choose appropriate treatment option individual patient . Consenting patient treatment na√Øve metastatic clear cell RCC recruit study . Before commence anti-angiogenic therapy , patient undergo 3 Tesla MRI cover primary tumour large metastatic deposit identify stag CT examination prior nephrectomy perform . Following 4 week therapy ( one treatment cycle ) , patient undergo repeat MR image use protocol .</detailed_description>
