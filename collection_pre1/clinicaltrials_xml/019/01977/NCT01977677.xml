	<brief_summary>This pilot phase I/II trial study side effect best dose plerixafor radiation therapy temozolomide see well work treat patient newly diagnose high grade glioma . Plerixafor may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving plerixafor radiation therapy temozolomide may effective treatment high grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plerixafor After Radiation Therapy Temozolomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety use continuous infusion Plerixafor subsequent irradiation patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . II . To assess efficacy Plerixafor measure progression free survival 6 month ( PFS6 ) start irradiation . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study plerixafor follow phase II study . Within 4 week surgery , patient undergo radiation therapy receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) 42 day . Beginning 8 day prior completion chemoradiotherapy , patient receive plerixafor intravenously ( IV ) continuously 2-4 week . Patients also receive temozolomide PO 5 day month begin 35 day completion radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 5 year .</detailed_description>
