	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine high dose CXD101 ( novel histone deacetylase inhibitor ) safely administer patient advanced tumour . The study also investigate use HR23B expression tumour biomarker response treatment CXD101 . Patients solid tumour , lymphoma myeloma consider study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Trial CXD101 Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat CXD101 administer orally start 1mg twice day ( ie : 2mg/day ) . Dose escalation proceed accord standard 3+3 phase 1 scheme . Adverse experience evaluate accord NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4.0 . Dose escalation continue dose limit toxicity encounter &gt; 1/3rd patient dose level . The dose level determine maximum tolerated dose . Patients treat , discretion Principal Investigator , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent . At maximum tolerate dose 20 patient , define tumour HR23B expression enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year . 2 . Life expectancy least 12 week . 3 . ECOG performance score ≤ 1 4 . Histologically cytologically confirm malignant tumour potential benefit HDAC inhibitor therapy . 5 . High HR23B express tumour sample IHC ( expansion cohort ) . 6 . Evaluable disease . 7 . The patient willing able comply protocol duration study , include schedule followup visit examination . 8 . Patients must recover effect prior treatment , include surgery ( persistent grade 1 toxicity permit discretion Chief Investigator ) . 9 . Female patient reproductive potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior start trial . Both woman men must agree use medically acceptable method contraception throughout treatment period 16 week discontinuation treatment . Oral contraception parenteral hormonal contraceptive ( patch , injectables implant ) may affect enzymeinducing drug use combination barrier method .

Haematological biochemical index within acceptable range detail study protocol . 1 . Pregnant breastfeed woman woman childbearing potential unless effective method contraception use . 2 . Other psychological , social medical condition , physical examination find laboratory abnormality Investigator considers would make patient poor trial candidate could interfere protocol compliance interpretation trial result . 3 . Patients know serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C HIV . 4 . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy use investigational agent within 28 day prior trial entry ( long period depend defined characteristic agent use ) . Limited field radiotherapy isolated lesion bone soft tissue must complete 2 week prior trial entry . 5 . Patients must receive concurrent anticancer therapy , include investigational agent , onstudy . Patients may continue use bisphosphonates bone disease corticosteroid provide dose stable trial . 6 . Major surgery within 4 week start study . 7 . Coexisting active infection require parenteral antibiotic serious concurrent illness deem clinically significant . 8 . Patients know brain metastasis , unless show stable ( symptomatically and/or radiologically ) period 2 month . 9 . History refractory nausea vomiting , chronic GI disease ( eg : inflammatory bowel disease ) significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption oral medication . 10 . Patients unable swallow oral medication . 11 . Patients correct QT interval &gt; 450msec . 12 . Persistent grade 2 great toxicity cause . 13 . Previous treatment HDAC inhibitor .</criteria>
