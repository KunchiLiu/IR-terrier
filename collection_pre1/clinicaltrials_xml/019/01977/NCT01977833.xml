To test hypothesis clarify whether glucose , insulin GLP-1 postprandial response different morning vs. afternoon , investigator compare T2D subject random order two separate day : glucose , insulin GLP-1 postprandial response breakfast , lunch dinner 2 isocaloric meal plan test diet , differ meal timing distribution The investigator hypothesize GLP-1 insulin response high calorie breakfast high comparison GLP-1 insulin response identical meal evening</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Meal Timing Postprandial Glucose , Insulin GLP-1 Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endogenous circadian ( 24-h ) timing system , synchronize light/dark cycle master circadian clock suprachiasmatic nucleus meal time peripheral clock gene ; play significant role regulate sleep/wake feeding behavior , body weight well glucose lipid metabolism . Circadian misalignment , involve sleep/wake meal timing schedule 12 h phase habitual time result elevated blood pressure increase postprandial glucose insulin level . Animal model circadian misalignment specially breakfast skip associate alteration expression pattern clock gene Clock , Bmal1 , Cry1 , Per2 liver fat cell . These change result predisposition obesity type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . This may also explain even night eat often associate weight gain obesity . Breakfast skip consistently associate increase , visceral adiposity , high BMI waist circumference , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia T2D despite less total daily caloric intake . A recent population-based study find participant even preference ( late chronotype ) involve breakfast skipping , 2.5 time risk develop T2D , even adjustment body mass index ( BMI ) ( 12 ) . Breakfast skip great percentage daily caloric intake dinner associate high fasting plasma glucose level , poor glycemic control compare earlier chronotypes even adjust BMI ( 11,20,21 ) . Recently document T2D patient , breakfast skipping associate associate 10.8 % increase HbA1C original value , even adjust age , sex , race , BMI , number diabetes complication , insulin use , depressive symptom , perceive sleep debt , percentage daily caloric intake dinner . This significant difference HbA1C level breakfast skipper breakfast eater patient T2D , highlight potential impact meal timing course disease . More recently investigator document compare conventional diet , high caloric intake breakfast reduce dinner result significant reduction HbA1c T2D individual . The existence diurnal variation glucose tolerance healthy subject T2D suspect decade , report show glucose tolerance decrease progressively throughout day insulin sensitivity reach nadir evening . The reduction glucose tolerance evening , seem result combination reduce glucose utilization , decrease insulin sensitivity , inappropriately low insulin secretion action , highlight importance meal time glucose metabolism . It known insulin response meal ingestion rapid morning afternoon specifically early ( 30 45 min ) insulin secretion oral glucose meal ingestion significantly higher morning even . A possible explanation rapid glucose clearance circulation morning early insulin response important rapid reduction hepatic glucose output meal ingestion . Recently show enhance early ( 30-min ) insulin secretion morning meal vs. afternoon , accompany correspondingly faster incretin total GLP-1 intact GLP-1 hormone response morning specially first 30 min ingestion . The association consistent also support prediction high GLP-1 level morning meal would result high potentiation β-cell function . This diurnal pattern enhance insulin GLP-1 response morning meal versus evening , might underlie explanation beneficial effect eat breakfast reduce dinner v skip breakfast glycemic control HbA1c T2D patient . To test hypothesis investigator compare random order two separate day : glucose , insulin GLP-1 postprandial response breakfast , lunch dinner 2 isocaloric meal plan test diet , differ meal timing distribution 1 . High caloric breakfast , average lunch reduce dinner ( BTdiet ) 2 . High caloric dinner , similar lunch reduce breakfast ( DTdiet )</detailed_description>
