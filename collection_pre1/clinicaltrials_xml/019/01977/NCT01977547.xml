	<brief_summary>ABC PICU randomize clinical trial compare clinical consequence RBC storage duration 1538 critically ill child . Laboratory observational evidence point serious concern lack safety effectiveness old RBCs , especially vulnerable population . Physicians institution systematically transfuse fresh RBCs pediatric patient primarily belief use fresh RBCs improve outcomes . Conversely , standard practice blood bank deliver old RBC unit order decrease blood wastage . To provide much need high quality evidence answer question `` RBCs reduce storage duration improve outcome ? '' The ABC PICU Trial conduct RCT compare development New Progressive Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ( NPMODS ) critically ill child transfuse either RBCs store ≤ 7 day standard issue RBCs ( expect mean RBC storage duration 17-21 day ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients consider eligible participate trial one follow occur : 1 . First RBC transfusion request within first 7 day ( 168 hour ) ICU admission . OR 2 . First RBC transfusion request patient Emergency Room , PICU team involve clinical care patient , patient definitively transfer ICU . OR 3 . Patient assess preoperatively ICU admission plan postoperatively , determine definitively require first RBC transfusion surgery . Eligible critically ill pediatric patient expect length stay transfusion ICU &gt; 24 hour base best judgment attend ICU staff . Age time enrollment &lt; 3 day birth reach 16th birthday . Postconception age &lt; 36 week time enrollment Documented RBC transfusion within 28 day prior fulfil eligibility criterion Previously randomize study Weight &lt; 3.0 kg ICU admission Known Pregnancy Conscious objection unwillingness receive blood product Not expect survive beyond 24 hour , brain death suspect brain death Limitation withdrawal care decision make Enrollment another randomize clinical trial approve coenrollment Patients autologous and/or direct donation RBCs provide Patients treat physician routinely systematically request RBC ≤ 14 day storage Patients systematically exist RBC aliquoting policy mandate initial use unit store ≤ 14 day ( ex : PediPack ) . On ECMO plan immediately place ECMO time enrollment Patient predict presumed require massive transfusion ( &gt; 40ml/kg blood component 24 hour period ) accord treat physician judgment Refusal physician Inability obtain consent Blood bank personnel experience difficulty secure blood product ( difficult cross match , rare blood group disease like IgA deficiency ) Insufficient number ABO type compatible RBC unit available blood bank randomization storage time ≤ 7 day ( minimum 1 unit regardless patient age ) All RBC unit available patient leukocytereduced prior storage</criteria>
