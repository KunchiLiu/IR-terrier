	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety tolerability topical tacrolimus 0.05 % twice day treatment ocular graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . A secondary objective compare efficacy topical tacrolimus 0.05 % drop compare topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5 % drops patient ocular GVHD . 40 patient ocular GVHD meet inclusion criterion study determine screen visit divide two equal group . In addition current medication , one group receive topical tacrolimus 0.05 % drop group receive topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5 % drop . The participant two follow-up visit week 5 week 10 marker screen visit . To evaluate purpose study well patient 's safety , follow procedure perform visit : comprehensive eye examination , tear break-up time ( TBUT ) , Schirmer 's test , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , fundoscopy grading score lid margin corneal fluorescein stain . The following questionnaire administer visit : Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) Symptom Assessment Dry Eye ( SANDE ) . Impression cytology specimens take screen visit week 10 visit .</brief_summary>
