	<criteria>Subjects eligible meet inclusion criterion : General criterion Age : &gt; =18 year age . ( Week 4 verification ) Gender : Female male subject . ( Week 4 verification ) Females : If childbearing potential , must agree use one approve contraception method , Screening completion Followup Visit OR nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , hysterectomy , oophorectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) 23.0116.3 International unit per liter ( IU/L ) estradiol &lt; =10 picomole per liter ( pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one approve contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 2 week must elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method ; QT Interval Corrected Heart Rate ( QTc ) : Bazett 's Correction QT Interval ( QTcB ) &lt; 470 millisecond ( msec ) QTcB &lt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block . There QTc inclusion criterion subject predominantly pace rhythm . CKDrelated criteria Dialysis frequency : On hemodialysis ( HD ) three five time weekly least 4 week prior Week 4 Screening Week 4 . NOTE : Combination method include hemofiltration ( HF ) ultrafiltration ( UF ) HD allow . However , type dialysis ( HD , hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) UF ) change study . Dialysis adequacy : A singlepool dialyzer clearance multiply dialyzer time divide volume distribution urea ( Kt/Vurea ) &gt; =1.2 base historical value obtain within prior month order ensure adequacy dialysis . If Kt/Vurea available , average last 2 value urea reduction ratio ( URR ) least 65 % . NOTE : Only need confirm Week 4 . Hemoglobin : Baseline Hgb 9.011.5 g/dL ( may rescreen minimum 2 week ) . Stable rhEPO dose : Using rhEPO ( epoetins biosimilars , darbepoetin ) total weekly dos vary 50 % 4 week prior Week 4 . At Day 1 ( randomization ) , confirm total weekly dos vary 50 % screening period . Iron replacement therapy : Subjects may stable maintenance oral IV ( &lt; =100 mg/week ) iron supplementation . If subject oral IV iron , dose must stable 4 week prior Week 4 , screen phase , first 4 week Randomization . Subjects eligible meet exclusion criterion : CKDrelated criterion Dialysis modality : Planned change HD peritoneal dialysis within study time period . Renal transplant : Preemptive schedule renal transplant . High rhEPO dose : An epoetin dose &gt; =360 IU/Kg/Week IV &gt; =250 IU/kg/week subcutaneous ( SC ) darbepoetin dose &gt; =1.8 microgram ( Âµg ) /Kg/Week IV SC within prior 8 week Day 1 ( randomization ) . Use methoxy polyethylene glycol epoetin beta within prior 8 week Day 1 ( randomization ) . Laboratory testbased criterion ( Week 4 verification ) Vitamin B12 : At low limit reference range ( may rescreen minimum 8 week ) . Folate : &lt; 2.0 nanogram ( ng ) /mL ( &lt; 4.5 nanomole ( nmol ) /L ) ( may rescreen minimum 4 week ) . Ferritin : &lt; 100 ng/mL ( &lt; 100 Micrograms per liter ) . Transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) : Outside reference range . Cardiovascular diseaserelated criterion Myocardial infarction acute coronary syndrome : Within 8 week prior Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Stroke transient ischemic attack : Within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Heart failure : Class III/IV heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) ; Symptomatic right heart failure diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Hypertension : Defined use predialysis vitals ( Week 4 , Day 1 ) diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 100 millimeter mercury ( mmHg ) systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 170 mmHg . Thrombotic disease : History thrombotic disease ( e.g. , venous thrombosis deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism , arterial thrombosis new onset worsen limb ischemia require intervention ) , except vascular access thrombosis , within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Other diseaserelated criterion Ophthalmology disease : Meeting ophthalmologicrelated exclusion criterion determine Screening ophthalmology exam . Inflammatory disease : Active chronic inflammatory disease could impact erythropoiesis ( e.g. , scleroderma , systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , celiac disease ) diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Hematological disease : Any hematological disease include affect platelet , white red blood cell ( e.g . sickle cell anemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , hematological malignancy , myeloma , hemolytic anemia thalassemia ) , coagulation disorder ( e.g. , antiphospholipid syndrome , Protein C S deficiency ) , cause anemia renal disease diagnose prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Liver disease : Current liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) evidence Screening abnormal liver function test [ alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &gt; 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ] ; hepatic abnormality opinion investigator would preclude subject participation study . NOTE : Those Hepatitis B Hepatitis C eligible provide exclusion meet . Major surgery : Major surgery ( exclude vascular access surgery ) within prior 8 week , Week 4 Screening phase plan study . Transfusion : Blood transfusion within prior 8 week , Week 4 Screening phase anticipate need blood transfusion study . GI Bleeding : Evidence actively bleed peptic , duodenal , esophageal ulcer disease OR clinically significant GI bleeding within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Acute infection : Clinical evidence acute infection history infection require intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic therapy within 8 week prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . NOTE : IV antibiotic prophylaxis allow . Malignancy : Subjects history malignancy within prior 5 year , receive treatment cancer , strong family history cancer ( e.g. , familial cancer disorder ) ; exception squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin definitively treat prior Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . Concomitant medication Investigational Productrelated criterion Severe allergic reaction : History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction hypersensitivity excipients investigational product . Drugs supplement : Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement prohibit Week 4 Screening Followup Visit . Prior investigational product exposure : The Subject participate clinical trial receive experimental investigational product within prior 30 day Week 4 Screening Day 1 ( randomization ) . General healthrelated criterion Other Conditions : Any condition , clinical laboratory abnormality , examination find Investigator considers would put subject unacceptable risk . Pregnancy Lactation : Pregnant female determine positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test OR woman lactate Week 4 Screening trial . Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations Laboratory eligibility criterion assess accord central laboratory result screen sample . Subjects fail screening may rescreened soon investigator feel may become eligible . However , individual subject may rescreen twice . There predetermined amount time investigator need wait rescreen previously ineligible subject , except exclude Hgb folate may rescreen 2 4 week , respectively , exclude Vitamin B12 may rescreen 8 week</criteria>
