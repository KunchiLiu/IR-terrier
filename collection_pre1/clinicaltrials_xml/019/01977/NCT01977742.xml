	<brief_title>Rest-exercise Transition Training Improve Cardiac Vagal Tone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allocating admission supervise exercise program subject evaluate low cardiac vagal tone ( cardiac vagal index ≤ 1,30 ) , expect sample almost 150 subject ( 18 years-old , range mostly 40 50 ) , compare 50 subject adhere supervised exercise program ( 65 % expect presence ) . Patients pacemaker unable exercise bicycle exclude study , well adhere least 65 % expect presence supervise exercise program . All sample randomize perform 8 week specific sudden rest-exercise training 8 week discontinue protocol , opposite ( 8 week specific protocol , follow 8 week specific sudden rest-exercise training ) . The cardiac vagal evaluate every 8 week measure cardiac vagal index phase . During time , client perform aerobic , strength flexibility exercise part supervise exercise program .</detailed_description>
