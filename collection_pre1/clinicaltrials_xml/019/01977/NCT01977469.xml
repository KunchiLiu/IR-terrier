	<brief_summary>The local systemic manifestation affect patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) cause severe dyspnoea limitation functional capacity , leading impairment performance activity daily live ( ADL ) . The combination aerobic resistance training , upper limb ( UL ) low limb ( LL ) , appear physiologically complete resource improve quality life increase survival patient . Therefore , aim study assess impact aerobic resistance training different intensity performance dyspnoea activity daily live prediction mortality patient COPD . There include 30 COPD patient moderate severe obstruction , age 50-80 year gender . All patient undergo follow assessment reassessment : history anthropometric data , Scale London Chest Activity Daily Living Scale ( LCADL ) , modify Medical Research Council ( mMRC ) , BODE index , test peripheral muscle strength , mobility balance test , 6-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) , Circuit ADL Test , 1 repetition maximum ( 1RM ) Incremental Cardiopulmonary Testing ( ICPT ) . Patients randomly divide two group undergo treatment program consist session last approximately 1 hour , three time week 12 consecutive week , total 36 session . All patient undergo general stretch aerobic training cycle ergometer intensity 70-80 % maximum load achieve ICPT . After aerobic training , group patient achieve protocol low-intensity resistance training ( LI-RT ) , emphasis gain muscle strength , group submit protocol high intensity ( HI-RT ) , aim great gain muscle strength . The calculation intensity training conduct 1RM test . After train protocol , expect find improved performance dyspnoea activity daily live reduction BODE index group , however , expect group low-intensity resistance training present great benefit ADL .</brief_summary>
