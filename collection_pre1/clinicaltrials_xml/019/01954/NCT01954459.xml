	<brief_title>Warming Sensors : Does Site Warming Improve Continuous Glucose Monitor Performance ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : 1 . Warming skin subcutaneous tissue InsuPatch device improve accuracy CGM compare CGM use alone calibrated standard laboratory quality glucose measure reference standard . 2 . Warming skin subcutaneous tissue InsuPatch device reduce lag time CGM , compare CGM use alone calibrated standard laboratory quality glucose measure reference standard . 3 . The combination InsuPatch device CGM well-tolerated cause skin irritation .</detailed_description>
