	<brief_title>LDE225 Paclitaxel Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open label phase I dose-escalation trial LDE225 administer daily ( OD ) Paclitaxel administer weekly three week ( day 1 , 8 , 15 ) 28-day cycle adult patient advance solid tumor progress despite standard therapy . The trial consist three part . In Part A ( dose escalation follow standard 3+3 design ) , patient previously treat advanced solid tumor receive escalate dos LDE225 combination standard Paclitaxel dose , define MTD RP2D LED225 OD give combination standard dose Paclitaxel . Once MTD RP2D establish 6 patient , part B start . Part B C expansion cohort patient advance platinum-resistant ovarian cancer ( 6 patient ) evaluate safety combination ass preliminary antitumor activity . In Part B , prior taxane therapy must administer 3-week schedule . In Part C , prior taxane therapy must administer weekly schedule follow wash-out period least 6 month .</detailed_description>
