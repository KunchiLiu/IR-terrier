	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled study design determine effectiveness myo-Inositol 5 % Injection increase incidence survival without severe Retinopathy Prematurity ( ROP ) acute/final ROP determination 55 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) premature infant &lt; 28 0/7 week ' gestation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Inositol Reduce Retinopathy Prematurity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 1760 infant enrol approximately 18 NICHD Neonatal Research Network ( NRN ) Centers ( approximately 44 site ) United States . Infants meet study selection criterion inform consent obtain randomize receive either 80 mg inositol/kg/day placebo , administer divided dos every 12 hour ( 40 mg/kg/dose ) . Study drug administer daily , start within 12 72 hour birth continue early 34 week PMA , 10 week chronologic age , time hospital discharge transfer . Inositol placebo administer IV enteral feeding reach 120ml/kg/day ( sooner infant longer receive IV fluid ) , time dose formulation administer enterally every 12 hour . For publication purpose , analysis primary efficacy outcome consider entire study population . In support new drug application ( NDA ) use myo-Inositol 5 % Injection increase survival without severe ROP determination acute/final ROP status , analysis primary efficacy outcome conduct entire study population separately within pre-specified regulatory sub-studies create administratively split infant enrol study center two sub-studies . Assessments perform study include customary newborn intensive care procedure include repeat eye examination ROP status final ( often extend discharge ) , measurement growth , cranial ultrasound image per usual practice , collection clinical diagnosis throughout hospitalization evaluate common morbidity extreme preterm birth . Adverse event record time treatment initiation 7 day last dose study drug , concurrent medication record 24 hour prior randomization 7 day last dose study drug discharge transfer sooner . Using separate NICHD Follow-up protocol , long term data collect 22-26 month correct age , include growth , neurodevelopmental testing , overall health status , rehospitalizations , surgery diagnosis , include ophthalmic diagnosis treatment since discharge .</detailed_description>
