	<detailed_description>The goal main study test hypothesis message promote promise smoking-related belief theme identify Hornik Woolf ( 1999 ) method increase anti-smoking intention great extent less-promising belief theme . This hypothesis test expose research participant message base range belief theme compare anti-smoking intention across condition . Using method describe Hornik Woolf ( 1999 ) , promise less-promising smoking-related belief identify use cross-sectional survey data examines association smoking-related beliefs intention . The research team previously use method advise campaign developers smoking-related belief target anti-smoking campaign , although cross-sectional evidence suggestive could tease apart causal order belief intention ( i.e. , people anti-smoking beliefs intention smoke , people n't intend smoke develop anti-smoking belief ) . Because evidence cross-sectional , currently unknown whether anti-smoking message base promising smoking-related belief indeed likely increase intention smoke . Therefore , two part study conduct experimentally . First , pilot study , pretest large set theme use main study ensure theme use ( whether promise unpromising ) equally convince . Otherwise , may difference intention base treatment group simply manipulation work one group another , hold promise belief actually effective increase intention . Our claim possible convince people type belief ( promise less-promising ) , would less likely smoke promise case less-promising case belief powerful change intention . For main study , therefore use small set theme experimentally manipulate respondent expose promising smoking-related message expose less-promising smoking-related message . We expect randomly assign group endorse promise less-promising smoking-related belief different extent . This allow u test hypothesis promise belief effective increase anti-smoking intention examine difference smoking-related intention base treatment group ( exposure either promise less-promising message ) .</detailed_description>
