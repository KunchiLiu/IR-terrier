	<brief_title>Use Touch Touch Guide-wire Techniques Deep Biliary Cannulation : TNT Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common technique use achieve primary deep biliary cannulation standard contrast-assisted method , catheter sphincterotome introduce papilla direction bile duct contrast medium inject confirm duct cannulate . The biliary guidewire cannulation technique consist introduction guide-wire bile duct instead contrast injection first maneuver . The benefit technique , compare classic contrast cannulation , demonstrate several study show similar result analyze recent meta-analysis , include 5 study 1762 patient , demonstrate use guide-wire technique significantly improve primary cannulation rate 74.9 % 85.3 % . More importantly , significantly reduce incidence PEP 8.6 % 1.6 % . There several variation technique ; tip sphincterotome insert initially millimeter papillary orifice introduce guide-wire target ( `` touch technique '' ) . Another variation direct cannulation guide-wire hover millimeter catheter sphincterotome ( `` touch technique '' ) . To date , randomize control trial compare two described way access biliary duct regard efficacy rate complication .</detailed_description>
