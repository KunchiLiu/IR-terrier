	<brief_summary>This phase 1 study test different dose new investigational drug call CFI-400945 see dose safe people . This study also look safety CFI-400945 study effect patient advance cancer . This drug test animal yet people . CFI-400945 oral ( take mouth ) drug work block polo-like kinase 4 ( PLK4 ) work . PLK4 protein important regulating cell growth division cell death . Many tumor show make much PLK4 . When much PLK4 produce , believe lead uncontrolled cancer cell growth division . Therefore , block protein work , believe stop tumor grow shrink .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CFI-400945 Fumarate Patients With Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All participant receive CFI-400945 . At begin study , participant give low dose CFI-400945 watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , participant ask join study give high dose study drug . Participants join study later get high dos study drug participant join earlier . This continue high dose study drug take without severe side effect find ( call maximum tolerate dose ) . Doses high give . After best dose study drug find , additional participant ask join study give study drug maximum tolerate dose test safety drug dose .</detailed_description>
