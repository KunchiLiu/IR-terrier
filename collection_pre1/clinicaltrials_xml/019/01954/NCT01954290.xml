	<brief_summary>Stroke remain fourth lead cause death United States ( second worldwide ) lead cause long-term disability , result total direct indirect cost approximately $ 73.7 billion annually . The failure novel therapy clinical trial demonstrate complex neural response stroke must target multiple level improve patient outcome . Despite significant improvement stroke treatment management , 1 year survival rate among stroke patient age 65 year around 25 % , 5- year survival rate amount approximately 50 % . The high chance death within 30 day stroke . Mortality increase due worsen brain dysfunction , elevate intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , comorbid condition . Treatments aim reduce post-stroke cytotoxic edema may reduce risk development malignant stroke mortality . Current treatment osmo-therapy hemicraniectomy substantial limitation , mortality remain high , despite measure outcomes remain unsatisfactory . There great need alternative medical approach safe , predictable , help ameliorate post stroke edema .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous work demonstrate pathophysiological role arginine-vasopressin ( AVP ) ischemic stroke . The mechanism action AVP 3 receptor subtypes : V1a , V1b V2 express brain , pituitary gland , myocardium , vasculature kidney . The role vasopressin receptor V1a V2 subtype cerebral edema formation ischemic stroke remain controversial . The V1a receptor antagonism cause platelet inhibition , aquaporin-4 regulation ; reduce infarct size vasodilation . V1 antagonists also show prevent ischemia-induced cerebral edema development , suggest V1 vasopressin receptor important water regulation brain cell . Another study indicate vasopressin receptor V1 involve pathogenesis secondary brain damage focal cerebral ischemia . Recently , study demonstrate V2 receptor antagonist ( OPC-31260 ) , may one effective drug early treatment cytotoxic edema brain injury . Treatment OPC-31260 ameliorate cerebral neurological deficit transgenic ( GET-1 ) mouse water intoxication . Treatment OPC-31260 also significantly abolished water accumulation regulate Aquaporin-4 ( AQP-4 ) expression level GET-1 mouse water intoxication . The intensity AQP-4 stain almost comparable control without water intoxication . It also show OPC-31260 dose 10 30 mg/kg produce dose-dependent inhibition subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced cerebral edema formation , accompanied increase urinary volume decrease urine osmolality without significant alteration urine electrolytes . OPC-31260 also effective treat water retention disease , hyponatremia cause inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion , congestive heart failure , liver cirrhosis . V2 receptor antagonism also help abolish water accumulation , decrease Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein ( GFAP ) astrocytes importantly cause renal tubule-selective diuretic effect call aquaresis ( electrolyte spar diuresis ) , may additional benefit reduction cerebral edema . This combined approach V1a V2 AVP receptor antagonism lead attenuation ischemia related cerebral edema infarct volume modulate ischemia-evoked AQP-4 expression . This effect help behavior mortality turn improve outcome stroke patient . The purpose project test effect mixed V1a V2 receptor blockade ischemic hemorrhagic stroke outcome . In summary , investigator use approach mixed vasopressin antagonism post stroke edema , infarct volume outcome . This research lead great understanding role interaction different AVP receptor pathophysiology post stroke cytotoxic edema . New information effect mixed blockade V1a V2 receptor prevention cytotoxic edema post stroke reveal .</detailed_description>
