	<brief_title>A Study Access Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Pharmacodynamics ( PD ) Orally Administered GCC-4401C Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics multiple dos GCC-4401C healthy male subject . Forty-six subject plan enrollment . The study consist five cohort ( 10 mg , 20 mg , 40 mg , 60 mg , 80 mg ) eight subject per cohort . In 20 mg cohort , six additional subject receive rivaroxaban ( Xarelto® ) 20 mg active comparator open-label fashion . Within five cohort , six subject randomize GCC-4401C two subject randomize placebo . The secondary objective study - To characterize single dose safety , tolerability , PK oral administration GCC-4401C healthy male subject . - To characterize multiple dose pharmacodynamics oral administration GCC-4401C healthy male subject . - To determine appropriate dose range dose regimen oral GCC-4401C subsequent clinical trial . - To compare PK PD GCC-4401C active rivaroxaban ( Xarelto® ) group 20 mg healthy male subject .</detailed_description>
