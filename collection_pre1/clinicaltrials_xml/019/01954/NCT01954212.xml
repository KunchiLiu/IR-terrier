	<brief_summary>Stroke associate pneumonia ( SAP ) affect fifth stroke survivor annually , triple risk death 30 day contribute poorer rehabilitation outcome , prolong hospital stay dependency discharge . Systematic review evidence indicate enhanced oral health care ( OHC ) preventative effect incidence pneumonia amongst nursing home population ( absolute risk reduction 6.6 % 11.7 % ; number need treat 8.6 15.3 individual ) . There strong theoretical reason suggest similar benefit might observe stroke care setting current empirical evidence weak - trial quality ( randomisation , blinding , sample size , report ) , intervention description thus feasibility translation clinical practice poor . Following extensive pre-clinical programme work , investigator plan pilot phase ( Phase II ) stepped-wedge cluster RCT well-developed define complex OHC intervention versus usual OHC . Investigators aim establish robust web-based randomisation process , refine propose intervention ( training , tool , equipment ) , recruitment , adherence , record linkage sample methodology . Investigators also aim establish relationship SAP plaque diversity site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SOCLE II pilot phase ( Phase II ) stepped-wedge cluster randomise control trial ( RCT ) complex oral health care ( OHC ) intervention versus usual OHC . SOCLE II aim evaluate feasibility full scale pragmatic trial clinical cost effectiveness complex OHC package care versus usual care people stroke care setting . Ward level cluster randomisation progress step wedge manner period baseline data collection ward randomly allocate order 'convert ' usual care enhance oral health care intervention . This pilot trial ass feasibility deliver enhance OHC intervention across four site inform trial design full scale phase III trial include refining propose intervention ( training , tool , equipment ) , recruitment , adherence , record linkage , sample methodology , sample size calculation pilot health economic evaluation . Investigators also aim establish relationship SAP plaque diversity sit . Our propose pilot work support application plan Phase III definitive trial . Principal Research Questions : ( ) Are SOCLE intervention data collection process viable across multiple site ? ( ii ) Can sample size calculation estimate recruitment retention refine ? ( iii ) Can pneumonia event rate across several site distribution time post stroke onset determine ? ( iv ) Can association dental denture plaque SAP establish ? ( v ) Can predetermine criterion progression Phase III definitive multi-centred step wedge cluster RCT economic evaluation meet ?</detailed_description>
