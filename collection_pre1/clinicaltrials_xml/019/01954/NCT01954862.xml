	<brief_summary>Insufflation colon , usually room air , necessary distend lumen exploration . Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation instead room air insufflation ( AI ) show decrease symptom abdominal pain discomfort procedure particularly follow 24 hour . CO2 rapidly absorb intestinal mucosa exhale respiration . AI colonoscopy usually reference standard compare colonoscopy use CO2 insufflation . In two recent article AI compare either CO2 insufflation Water-aided colonoscopy ( WAC ) , entail infusion water facilitate insertion cecum . WAC categorize broadly Water Immersion ( WI ) Water Exchange ( WE ) . In WI water infuse insertion phase colonoscopy , removal infused water predominantly withdrawal . Occasional use insufflation may allow . WE entail complete exclusion insufflation , removal residual colonic air pocket feces , suction infuse water predominantly insertion minimize distention . During withdrawal phase insufflation use distend colonic lumen . In WAC arm two mention article insertion method use WI , infusion water room temperature 37Â°C . During withdrawal , air insufflation either air CO2 insufflation employ . Compared AI , CO2 insufflation WI ( use room air insufflation CO2 insufflation withdrawal ) effective study decrease sedation requirement , pain tolerance score , patient ' high willingness repeat procedure . Until direct comparison make within single study pain score colonoscopy use AI , CO2 insufflation , WI/CO2 , WE/CO2 , WI/AI WE/AI . In study test hypothesis , compare AI , CO2 insufflation WAC/CO2-AI method decrease pain score colonoscopy , reduction sedation requirement , WE achieve best result . This comparative study also aim test respective peculiarity method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective double blind two-center randomized control trial . Methods : Colonoscopy air insufflation , CO2 , Water Immersion/CO2 , Water Exchange/CO2 , Water Immersion/AI Water Exchange/AI aid insertion colonoscope ; split dose bowel preparation ; demand-sedation . Control method : Air insufflation colonoscopy . Study method : CO2 colonoscopy , Water Immersion/CO2 colonoscopy , Water Exchange/CO2 colonoscopy , Water Immersion/AI colonoscopy , Water Exchange/AI colonoscopy . Population : Consecutive 18 85 year-old diagnostic in-patients outpatient . After informed consent , assignment control study arm base computer generate randomization list block allocation stratification . Primary outcome : Maximum pain score record colonoscopy . Secondary outcome : Cecal intubation rate time , total procedure time ( include biopsy and/or polypectomy ) , need sedation dosage , overall pain score discharge . In addition , Adenoma Detection Rate , Mean Adenomas per Procedure , position change , amount infuse suctioned water insertion withdrawal record . Bloating examination discharge patient willingness repeat examination evaluate .</detailed_description>
