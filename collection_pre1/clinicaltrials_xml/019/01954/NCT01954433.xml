	<brief_title>Costs Consequences Three Common Orthopedic Procedures Upper Extremity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among various recognize method use assess benefit value medical service , cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) cost-utility analysis ( CUA ) take increasingly important role . Over recent year , economic evaluation gain interest orthopedics , suggest inclusion economic factor addition traditional outcome measure evaluation surgical intervention . This prospective mono-center observational study involve three independent patient group ( Total shoulder prosthesis arthritis ( TSA ) , Arthroscopic repair rotator cuff tear ( RCR ) , Trapeziectomy Trapeziometacarpal Osteoarthritis ( TMC OA ) ) 150 patient . Before-and-after comparison make : Cost-effectiveness cost-utility data collect post-operatively one ( TMC OA ) two year ( TSA RCR ) compare collect one year pre-operatively . Eligible patient unwilling receive surgery followed-up one two year , respectively , allow parallel comparison group .</detailed_description>
