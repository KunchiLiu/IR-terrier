	<brief_title>A Brief Patient-Controlled Intervention Symptom Cluster Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Co-occuring pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance common symptom cluster among patient advanced cancer , diminish functional status quality life . Cognitive-behavioral ( CB ) strategy ( e.g. , relaxation , distraction , imagery ) effective treatment symptom , provide logical choice manage three co-occurring symptom . CB strategy think work psychologically reduce anxiety stress , improve expectation symptom outcome , enhance perception personal control . Recent research also suggest physiologic pathway , CB strategies attenuate dysregulation stress hormone reduce proinflammatory cytokine contribute symptom exacerbation . CB strategies equally effective patient , difference base individual preference skill concurrent symptom . Thus , train single strategy sufficient . Our previous work demonstrate feasibility initial efficacy patient-controlled cognitive-behavioral ( PC-CB ) intervention patient receive information symptom rationale CB strategy , self-administer selection various relaxation , distraction , imagery strategy via MP3 player , use CB strategy whatever time place need . This brief intervention design mindful high symptom burden , unpredictable treatment course , often short life expectancy person advance cancer . The purpose study test efficacy PC-CB intervention randomize control trial test moderator mediator intervention effect . The specific aim ( 1 ) test efficacy PC-CB intervention severity , distress , interference daily life pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance symptom cluster , ( 2 ) test propose moderator ( image ability , concurrent symptom ) PC-CB intervention effect , ( 3 ) test psychological mediator ( anxiety , stress , outcome expectancy , perceive control ) PC-CB intervention effect , ( 4 ) explore two type physiological mediator ( neuroendocrine stress hormone index inflammation ) PC-CB intervention effect . A sample 198 adult receive chemotherapy advance breast , lung , colorectal , prostate , gynecologic solid tumor cancer experience pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance recruit . Patients randomize PC-CB intervention receive brief training session instruction use record CB strategy 9-weeks cancer treatment . Patients randomized attention control receive instruction use cancer educational recording period . Measures symptom severity distress , symptom interference daily life , propose psychological physiologic mediating variable complete baseline 3-week ( primary ) time point . Symptom outcome measure repeat 6- 9-week ( secondary ) time point evaluate long term treatment effect .</detailed_description>
