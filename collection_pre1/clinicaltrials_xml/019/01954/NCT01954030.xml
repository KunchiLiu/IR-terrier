	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Carboxyamidotriazole Orotate ( CTO ) combine standard dose bevacizumab among patient recurrent malignant glioma ( WHO grade III IV ) previously fail bevacizumab ( Phase 1 ) ; determine activity CTO alone bevacizumab-failure WHO grade IV malignant glioma patient ( Phase 2 , Arm 1 ) ; determine activity CTO plus bevacizumab bevacizumab-failure WHO grade IV malignant glioma patient ( Phase 2 , Arm 2 ) . This study terminate early due funding issue . At time termination , study still Phase 1 MTD combination CTO bevacizumab determine population . Phase 2 proceed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1/2 CTO + Bevacizumab Recurrent Glioma Post-Bevacizumab Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase 1 study , conduct dose-escalation study combination CTO standard dose bevacizumab among patient recurrent malignant glioma ( WHO Grade III IV ) previously fail bevacizumab . All patient also receive standard treatment radiation therapy temozolomide prior enrollment study . The Phase 2 portion study investigate two novel treatment regimens sequentially . Each regimen include 25 patient recurrent WHO grade IV malignant glioma treat past standard radiation therapy , temozolomide , bevacizumab . All patient must fail therapy bevacizumab . Subjects first treatment regimen receive CTO alone subject second treatment regimen receive combination CTO bevacizumab together . Note : This study terminate early due funding issue . At time termination , study still Phase 1 MTD combination CTO bevacizumab determine population . Phase 2 proceed .</detailed_description>
