	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well modern , conformal radiation therapy surgery work treat patient high-risk bladder cancer . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine feasibility adjuvant radiation management high-risk disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Prospectively evaluate pattern failure high-risk bladder cancer patient cystectomy aggressive adjuvant therapy . II . Define surgical histopathologic parameter predictive local distant outcome ( e.g . grade , lymphovascular space invasion [ LVSI ] , extent resection/lymph node dissection [ LND ] ) . III . Assess quality life ( QoL ) outcomes treatment use standardized questionnaire ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General [ FACT-G ] , FACT-Bladder Cancer [ BL ] , Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [ EPIC ] Bowel Urinary ) . OUTLINE : Within 24 week surgical resection , patient undergo 3D conformal radiation therapy daily 5 day per week 28 fraction . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3-5 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
