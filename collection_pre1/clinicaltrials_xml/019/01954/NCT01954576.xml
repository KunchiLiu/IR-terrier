	<criteria>Histologically confirm GBM ( WHO grade IV ) ; rare GBM variant ( e.g . gliosarcoma , giant cell GBM , small cell GBM , GBM oligodendroglioma feature , GBM PNET feature ) allow . Patients eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis GBM make . Received radiotherapy least 45 Gy temozolomide chemotherapy initial treatment GBM . Unequivocal evidence recurrent progressive GBM bevacizumab treatment first base radiographic appearance confirm histologic confirmation biopsy resection . Prior treatment Gliadel wafer allow least 3 month placement . There must interval least 12 week completion radiotherapy start device treatment . When interval le 12 week completion radiotherapy , histological confirmation progression must unequivocal per RANO criterion . The use PET scan , perfusion imaging , MRspectroscopy differentiate true early progression pseudoprogression prior biopsy resection probable recurrent tumor per standard care . At least 22 year age . Karnofsky performance status least 60 % . Life expectancy least 3 month . Planned biopsy resection recurrent tumor therapeutic and/or diagnostic purpose , adequate bone marrow , hepatic , cardiac , renal function undergo plan procedure . For patient undergone undergo stereotactic biopsy recurrent progressive tumor , postoperative MRI require , provide prebiopsy MRI within 21 day registration . If preoperative scan 21 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase 50 % date biopsy registration , new baseline MRI require stable decrease steroid dosage least 3 day even previous MRI within 21 day registration . For patient undergone undergo open resection recurrent progressive tumor , residual disease follow resection mandate eligibility study . To best assess extent residual disease postresection , MRI scan do later 96 hour immediate postresection period within 21 day prior registration . If 96hour scan 21 day registration , scan need repeat . If steroid dose increase 50 % date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require stable decrease steroid dosage least 3 day . Planned treatment NovoTTF Therapy alone per FDAapproved indication . NovoTTF Therapy must start within 14 day registration , less 7 day 21 day stereotactic biopsy ( applicable ) less 21 day 42 day open resection ( applicable ) . Availability tissue initial diagnosis recurrent tumor estimate sufficient quality quantity genomic DNA total RNA isolation ; preferably tissue would snap frozen high quality RNA preparation . Because genetic analysis describe Section 8.0 perform HRPO # 201111001 ( `` Analysis Histological , Genomic , Molecular , Clinical Factors CNS Cancer : NeuroOncology Group '' ) , patient enrol trial WUSM , require WUSM patient must also enroll HRPO # 201111001 . The genetic analysis UF patient take place WUSM auspices protocol . Recovery toxic effect prior therapy grade 1 &gt; 3 week prior therapy registration , whichever later . Patients must agree forgo treatment , include limited cytotoxic biologic chemotherapy , intend treat recurrent GBM receive treatment NovoTTF Therapy . Participants childbearing age must use effective contraception . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document . Any malignancy require active chemotherapy within previous 12 month prior registration disease currently progress and/or metastatic . The exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin , treat local resection carcinoma situ cervix . Unable undergo brain MRI due medical personal reason . Bevacizumabna√Øve patient : These patient may one prior relapse count current relapse treat protocol must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen , must include temozolomide . Bevacizumabrefractory patient : These patient may 2 prior relapse count current relapse treat protocol must receive multiple chemotherapy regimen , include temozolomide regimen bevacizumab regimen . If patient surgical resection relapse disease anticancer therapy institute 12 week , patient undergoes another surgical resection , consider one relapse . For patient prior therapy lowgrade glioma , surgical diagnosis recurrent tumor GBM consider first relapse . Currently receive investigational agent intend treatment recurrent GBM . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , recent heart attack within previous 12 month severe heart problem , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant breastfeeding . Implanted pacemaker , programmable shunt , defibrillator , deep brain stimulator , vagus nerve stimulator , implant electronic device brain spinal cord . Infratentorial tumor . History hypersensitivity hydrogel .</criteria>
