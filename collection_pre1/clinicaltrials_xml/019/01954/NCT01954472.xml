	<brief_summary>`` Is possible recruit retain 200 participant Randomize Control Trial ( RCT ) high impact lifestyle approach diet exercise design significantly reduce cardiovascular event middle-aged old men woman high risk event ? '' To address question , propose pilot study 3 year duration : 1 year recruitment randomization , full year intervention recruit participant , last 6 month ass one year data prepare submit full trial application , inform pilot study outcome term retention rate . The pilot continue full 9 year intervention roll main study involve additional Canadian center collaborate international center US , Britain , Europe , Australia , New Zealand , India , South Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There major need large RCT demonstrate effect lifestyle modification ( diet exercise ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) outcomes . The pilot study demonstrate feasibility prerequisite continue large RCT . Large RCT : This trial test effect high impact dietary approach combine food functional effect , include LDL-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) blood pressure ( BP ) reduction , together exercise program associate reduction carotid atheroma assess MRI . The combined approach significant effect CVD risk factor previous trial compare high cereal fibre diet exercise advice , consistent good clinical practice , randomize parallel trial 9 year duration . ~6,000 high risk participant recruit comprise individual 1 ) type 2 diabetes , 2 ) post myocardial infarction ( MI ) , 3 ) Statin intolerant individual . The primary outcome CVD event ( MI , stroke , fatal non-fatal ) ( 1 ) . We believe achieve 20 % reduction CVD event ~10 % related diet reflect reduction traditional risk factor ( LDL-C , BP ) 10 % exercise increase cardiovascular fitness year 9 . Pilot Study : We therefore propose undertake 1 year pilot study 200 participant demonstrate feasibility : 1 ) Successful recruitment ( 200 participants/year ) 2 ) retention ( &gt; 90 % ) Background : We demonstrate specific CVD reduce potential propose component dietary intervention series CIHR fund study . The core dietary component ( dietary portfolio FDA approve cholesterol-lowering food ) recent CIHR-funded trial reduce LDL-C 13-14 % ( JAMA 2011 ) reduction also diastolic blood pressure 6 month . The CVD risk score reduce ~10 % treatment . This approach combine increased level monounsaturated fat ( MUFA ) CIHR-funded portfolio study raise HDL-C reduce total : HDL-C ratio ( CMAJ 2010 ) result ~11 % CVD risk score reduction high MUFA compare low MUFA portfolio . Low glycemic index food select CIHR-funded trial type 2 diabetes increase HDL-C reduce HbA1c , total : HDL-C ratio ( JAMA 2008 ) , add emphasis legume ( dry pea , bean , lentil ) , significantly reduce BP lead CVD risk score reduction ~5 % ( Arch Intern Med 2012 ) . We consider dietary package major potential CVD risk reduction possible reduction relative risk 24 % absence negative positive interaction . The physical activity/exercise intervention end-product 25 year cumulative experience investigator Quebec Heart Lung Institute regard physical activity/exercise prescription various type individuals/patients . Our program also recently test high risk patient document coronary artery disease manage coronary artery bypass graft procedure ( with/without type 2 diabetes ) . Unpublished preliminary result latter intervention high risk patient indicate program induces substantial improvement CVD risk factor profile beyond clinical guidelines-aligned optimal pharmacotherapy intervention appear induce significant reduction carotid artery atherosclerosis assess magnetic resonance imaging . The late meta-analysis estimate 150 min/week moderate exercise reduce CHD risk 14 % . Our Laval program 420 min/wk moderate exercise plus additional structured exercise would therefore also reduce CVD risk least 14 % ( much 39 % relationship exercise time CVD risk reduction linear ) . The program aim reduce sedentary behavior . It safe affordable clinical practice . At cost $ 900 per patient first year major training take place , considerably less expensive DPP , DPS Look AHEAD trial . The research question therefore : 1 . What feasibility term recruitment retention implement high impact diet physical activity/exercise program CVD prevention high risk statin-intolerant individual ? 2 . Based observed retention pilot study , require recruitment large trial refine , necessary .</detailed_description>
