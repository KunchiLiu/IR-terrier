	<brief_summary>Non-invasive simple , intranasal ( IN ) route administration seem promise pain management Emergency Department ( ED ) , especially use precociously triage nurse rapidly deliver first opioid dose severely painful patient . This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study focus severe traumatic pain experience adult admit ED . We hypothesize , addition traditional morphine titration , single dose IN sufentanil give triage would significantly increase proportion patient relieve 30 minute ED admission . Time discharge , proportion side effect satisfaction rate also record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Sufentanil Pain-management Entrance Emergency Department : Influence Pain-relief Delay</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Time pain-relief vary widely Emergency Department ( ED ) , depend various factor ED overcrowd inadequate training pain management . As intravenous ( IV ) opioid administration world-wide recommend severe pain treatment , delay triage room admission first IV injection directly influence time pain-relief . Moreover , proven incorrect adherence morphine titration protocol participate ED oligoanalgesia . Although ED experience intranasal ( IN ) opioid administration still lack , simple non-invasive way treat pain seem safe promising . Opioid pharmacokinetic IN route indeed interesting ED practitioner : assure timely analgesia , low Cmax delay Tmax IN route theoretically limit risk respiratory depression , comparison IV route . We propose randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study convenience sample adult patient admit ED ( annual census 80000 attendance ) isolate limb injury , experience severe pain ( score &gt; 5/10 numerical pain scale ) . For primary outcome , compare proportion patient relieve ( score &lt; 4/10 ) 30 minute admission , depend administration ( ) single intranasal dose sufentanil ( 0,4 mcg/kg ) give triage nurse . Other secondary outcome include : evolution pain score first hour admission entire ED stay , proportion opioid-induced side-effects , proportion patient receive morphine dos morphine administrate , time discharge , patient staff satisfaction score .</detailed_description>
