	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) one common inflammatory diseases general population many cardiovascular disease ( valvular , myocardial , pericardial , coronary disease , stroke , heart failure etc . ) already describe disease . Large epidemiological study also demonstrate high degree severity atherosclerotic vascular disease RA patient , degree several author highlight fact , final analysis , prognosis RA rather determine severity atherosclerotic lesion . By reduce RA-related systemic inflammation , therefore hypothesize 24 week anti-TNF therapy would improve arterial endothelial function large artery stiffness . The propose study ass effect adalimumab therapy parameter . A group 26 RA patient recruit rheumatologist association French PACA region ( CONCERTO association ) . This study non invasive comprise : - vivo study endothelial function measure post-ischaemic dilatation 2D ultrasound ; - study large artery stiffness pulse wave velocity determine aplannation tonometry ; - study central pulse pressure ; - evaluation atherosclerosis-related parameter intima-media thickness . The result obtain provide good understanding mechanism involve RA-related vascular disease effect anti-TNF therapy . In view high prevalence RA , study could potentially interest medical community whole could largely diffuse .</brief_summary>
