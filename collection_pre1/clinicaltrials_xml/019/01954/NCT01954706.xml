	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy woman United States second lead cause cancer death . In 2013 , estimate 230,000 woman United States diagnose invasive breast cancer approximately 40,000 die.1 Women breast cancer frequently experience significant functional metabolic decline treatment due cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) , stress depression.2,3 Cancer-related fatigue associate side effect treatment , pain , functional disability , sleep disturbance , mood disturbance co-morbid conditions.4 Patients CRF decline physical activity function , significantly impact quality life ( QOL ) .5 The mechanism underlie functional decline fatigue breast cancer patient likely multifactorial , deconditioning , sarcopenia , increase inflammatory cytokine , insulin resistance , change muscle fat metabolism seem play important roles.4,6 Hormone receptor-positive tumor common breast cancer postmenopausal woman , endocrine therapy , block production effect estrogen , mainstay treatment patient . Due superior efficacy postmenopausal woman , aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) standard care long-term estrogen suppression patients.7 Estrogen deprivation , however , result multiple side effect may worsen fatigue functional metabolic decline associate cancer treatment.8 Some common side effect woman take AIs musculoskeletal symptom , include arthralgias myalgia , promote deconditioning sarcopenia associate side effects.9 Because prolong use AIs postmenopausal breast cancer patient improvements cancer-related outcome observe use , great effort take reduce AI induced musculoskeletal symptom ( AIMSS ) maintain adherence treatment . While multiple strategy use manage AIMSS , current therapy mainly focus intervention patient develop symptom ( tertiary prevention ) rather primary prevention.9 Exercise intervention breast cancer patient also improve QOL , decrease fatigue , increase physical function strength.10,11 Understanding role exercise AI side effect prevention allow u translate finding therapy guideline .</detailed_description>
