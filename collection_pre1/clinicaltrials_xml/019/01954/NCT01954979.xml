	<brief_summary>The participant invite take part study chronic Graft versus Host Disease ( cGVHD ) respond standard treatment steroid . This research study way gain new knowledge treatment patient cGVHD . This research study evaluate drug call abatacept . Abatacept drug alters suppress immune system . Abatacept approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment moderate severe active rheumatoid arthritis adult severe juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) patient fail prior therapy disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) . These autoimmune condition , ie cause overactive immune system attack normal tissue organ . It currently test variety autoimmune condition . In case consider experimental . cGVHD cause donor cell attack various organ recipient . The investigator try minimize immune attack use corticosteroid prednisone . In severe case prednisone sufficient immunosuppressive medication use addition order efficiently control cGVHD limit dose consequently multiple side-effects corticosteroid . This study do determine use abatacept safe patient cGVHD facilitate good control cGVHD . During study participant evaluate side effect treatment abatacept , response cGVHD treatment . There two group participant study . The first group treat relatively low dose abatacept . If find safe second group treat high dose . Three four tablespoon blood drawn every 2 week visit order determine blood count , kidney liver function . Some blood use research lab order study measure immune system might affect treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cGVHD care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - Complete Medical History Physical Examination - Blood Collection : 3-4 tablespoon blood draw measure participant complete blood count , kidney , liver thyroid function - Disease Assessment : Depending organ affect cGVHD participant may undergo blood test skin exam eye exam dental exam . - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) : noninvasive test measure electrical activity participant 's heart - A tuberculin skin test quantiferon blood test rule tuberculosis - Pregnancy test applicable - HIV Hepatitis blood test : 2-3 teaspoon blood collect perform HIV test . The participant ask sign separate consent form test . The participant 's doctor discus result test participant result become part permanent medical record . The participant may seek private HIV test prior consent , base result may choose whether participate study HIV test become part medical record . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study treatment . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . Additional research procedure perform time screening : - Research blood testing : study measure participant 's immune system After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : - Since investigator look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant abatacept , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose participant get depend number participant enrol study participant well tolerated dos . - The total duration treatment study approximately 113 day 6 treatment . Doses 1-3 administer every two week . One month follow Dose 3 , abatacept administer every four week remain three dos ( Doses 4-6 . ) The treatment give intravenously day . One month follow last dose treatment , participant see clinic . The participant see clinic weekly dose 4 , every 2 week follow even participant n't treatment . - The first group participant treat low dose abatacept . If dose determine safe second group treat high dose . During treatment participant see clinic every two week . At every visit follow perform : - Complete Medical History Physical Examination - Blood Collection : 3-4 tablespoon blood draw measure complete blood count , kidney , liver thyroid function - Research blood testing : study measure participant 's immune system - On day treatment participant undergo assessment cGVHD depend organ affect After final dose study drug : After participant complete take drug study , follow procedure test take place : - Safety assessment 28 day last dose study drug . - Complete Medical History Physical Examination - Blood Collection : 3-4 tablespoon blood drawn measure participant 's complete blood count , kidney , liver thyroid function - Disease Assessment : physical exam blood test participant leukemia multiple myeloma , physical exam PET/CT CT scan participant lymphoma . These do safety assessment visit 3 6 month follow visit . - Electrocardiogram - Research blood testing : study measure immune system - Once participant complete treatment study follow monthly 6 month</detailed_description>
