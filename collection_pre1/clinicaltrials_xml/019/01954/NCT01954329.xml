	<brief_summary>MIND-TIA primarily observational diagnostic study aim evaluate role novel biomarkers diagnosis Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) primary care . Rapid adequate diagnosis TIA great importance enable rapid start treatment , thereby decrease risk subsequent ischemic stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Markers Diagnosis TIA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : A Transient Ischaemic Attack ( TIA ) cause permanent damage brain tissue , risk subsequent ischemic stroke short term high . Timely recognition TIA would result early treatment reduce risk ischaemic stroke , adverse cardiovascular event . To improve management TIA adequate diagnosis imminent importance . However diagnosis notoriously difficult , GP neurologist . Adequate biomarkers brain ischaemia could improve early diagnosis thus subsequent management TIA . Objectives : 1 . To assess added diagnostic value biomarkers beyond clinical assessment ( medical history , sign symptom ) patient suspect TIA . Secondary objectives 2 . To assess prognostic value biomarkers patient establish diagnosis TIA . 3 . To assess time delay factor related delay patient suspect TIA . Study population : 350 adult person suspect TIA primary care . Methods : Recruitment patient perform general practice 200 GPs vicinity 4 5 participating hospital . During home visit research nurse collect blood sample , take two health-related questionnaire . Participants refer GP regional TIA outpatient clinic additional investigation , include brain imaging . The diagnostic accuracy set biomarkers assess 'definite ' diagnosis TIA panel neurologist reference standard .</detailed_description>
