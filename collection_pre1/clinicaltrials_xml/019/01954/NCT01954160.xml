	<brief_title>Study Renal Denervation Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over past decade , clinical trial HF unable alter natural history cardio-renal compromise . Fluid retention account majority admission acute decompensated heart failure , salt water removal use intravenous ( IV ) diuretic mainstay therapy apply population.1 Over 20 % hospitalized patient Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry ( ADHERE ) serum creatinine value great 2.0 mg/dL2 majority congest patient present significantly elevate systolic blood pressure rather low-output states.1 Administration IV loop diuretic produce intravascular volume depletion reduction glomerular filtration rates3 well increase neurohormonal activation.4 This true regardless whether LVEF impair preserved.5 However , despite relieve symptom , acute drug administration ( adenosine receptor antagonist natriuretic peptide analogue ) short duration change long-term cardio-renal outcome large clinical trial . Recent recognition different phenotype cardio-renal syndrome provide good characterization patient population evaluate specific treatment approach interventions.6 There great appreciation patient congestive HF depend adequate glomerular function renal glomerular filtration , also adequate tubular function effective sodium handling may may dependent glomerular filtration.7 Despite optimize intracardiac filling pressure , many patient August 28 , 2013 Page 10 58 cardio-renal compromise remain symptomatic , complain breathlessness fatigue often associate concomitant increase neurohormonal up-regulation ( e.g . natriuretic peptide ) poor outcomes.8 Since majority patient present hypertension , point possibility congestive HF precipitate heighten sympathetic drive . Animal model demonstrate blood pressure control renal tubular function/glomerular filtration ( function renal blood flow ) directly influence renal sympathetic nerve activity,9-12 evolve provide cardiovascular support set hypovolemia profound cardiovascular collapse . Specifically , HF animal model denervated kidney demonstrate improvement renal blood flow natriuresis ( restoration Na+-K+ ATPase loop Henle , well epithelial sodium pump distal tubule ) . However , understand persistently activate renal sympathetic outflow lead exaggerate neurohormonal up-regulation chemoreceptor regulation human still evolve . As heightened cardio-renal compromise lead disease progression congestive HF , conceivable approach selectively modulate renal sympathetic outflow may improve cardio-renal compromise well target mechanism lead symptomatic improvement at-risk patient . By establish mechanistic role renal sympathetic outflow patient impaired sodium handle contributor congestion HF , may better understand patient HF develop symptom , retain salt water , activate neurohormonal system . This trial hypothesis generate serve inform large clinical trial patient congestion relate HF . The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , independent committee assign sponsor oversee conduct safety study , meet May 12 , 2014 review information become available another study renal artery denervation procedure use investigational catheter PRESERVE study . Even though concern safety subject renal artery denervation , DSMB decide stop PRESERVE study . Based upon agreement FDA , protocol amend reduce subject participation 52 week 13 week collect limited safety information .</detailed_description>
