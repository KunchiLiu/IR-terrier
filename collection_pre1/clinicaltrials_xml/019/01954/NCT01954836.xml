	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Fasting ( 48h ) one day chemotherapy may protect normal cell adverse effect chemotherapy . Design : Within randomize control pilot trial 30 female patient gynecological cancer ( ovarian breast cancer ) 4-6 scheduled chemotherapy randomize fast 60-72 hour first half chemotherapy second half chemotherapy proceed normocaloric food intake cycles.Sequence fast normocaloric food intake randomize . Assessments adverse effect , quality life laboratory value take place 24 7 day chemotherapy . Statistical analysis compare summarize difference fast non-fasted chemotherapy cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-Term Fasting During Chemotherapy Patients With Gynecological Cancer- Randomized Controlled Cross-over Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence experimental animal provide strong support concept caloric restriction ( CR ) increase resistance multiple form stress . CR decrease plasma level growth factor , e.g . insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , thereby divert energy growth maintenance . Accordingly , currently available information suggest short-term fasting protects normal cell peril ( high dose ) chemotherapy . In contrast , cancer cell ( less ) protect result self-sufficiency growth signal . This phenomenon term Differential Stress Resistance ( DSR ) . DSR may reduce severity adverse effect cause chemotherapy , without interfere anti-tumoral effect . A first case series 10 cancer patient , suggest short-term fasting may also protect side effect chemotherapy human . This study aim evaluate impact short-term fasting tolerance chemotherapy humans.Within randomize control pilot trial 30 female patient gynecological cancer disease ( ovarian breast cancer ) stag 4-6 scheduled chemotherapy randomize fast 60-72 hour half chemotherapy normocaloric food intake chemotherapy . Fasting define caloric restriction 400kcal energy intake/day free intake water tea . Sequences fast normocaloric food intake randomize . Assessments adverse effect , quality life , fatigue laboratory value take place 24 7 day chemotherapy . Statistical analysis compare summarize difference fast non-fasted chemotherapy cycle , mean total max . 60-90 chemotherapy accompany fasting compare 60-90 non-fasted chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
