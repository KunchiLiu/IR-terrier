	<brief_title>Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Pancreatic Cancer That Can Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect escalate dos metformin ( metformin hydrochloride ) give pre-operatively pancreatic cancer cell proliferation apoptosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity escalate dos metformin give pre-operatively patient resectable pancreatic carcinoma . II . To measure effect metformin expression phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha ( ACC ) , phosphorylated mechanistic target rapamycin ( serine/threonine kinase ) ( mTOR ) , pancreatic cancer stem cell . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients undergo observation . GROUP II : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) least 7 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP III : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride Group II . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
