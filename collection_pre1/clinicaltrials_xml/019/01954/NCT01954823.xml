	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) common chronic neurological disease affect young adult , onset usually age 20-40 . Women affect 3-4 time men . The disease characterize 2 main phenotype : relapsing-remitting progressive course . MS complex multi-factorial disease , underlie genetic environmental factor . Different population different susceptibility ( Compston Coles 2008 ) . Clinical disability due distraction Central Nervous System ( CNS ) myelin ( mainly oligodendrocytes ) due 3 process ( Franklin 2002 ; Franklin Ffrench-Constant 2008 ; Frischer , Bramow et al . 2009 ) : 1 . Inflammation- immune cell aberrant activity invade brain spinal cord cause distraction CNS myelin ( process call demyelination secondary neurodegeneration - axonal neuronal loss ) 2 . Primary neurodegeneration ( axonal neuronal loss ) - without prominent inflammation 3 . Repair - inflammatory neurodegenerative process follow attempt CNS repair - however , partial incomplete repair often basis residual deficit disability ( Chandran , Hunt et al . 2008 ) . These process cause damage CNS , brain spinal cord , lead deficiency several neurologic system motoric , sensory , sphincter , visual cognitive . MS diagnose clinical evaluation neurologist conjunction detection inflammation white matter CNS MRI . Following increase understanding disease , last 10-15 year new subcutaneous injection immunotherapy available ( COPAXON / TEVA ; Interferon -beta : Avonex . Betaferon Rebif ) Tysabri infusion . These drug cause side effect extent treatment may discontinue . Recently oral drug Gilenya release market , additional oral drug Laquinimod BG-12 ( Dimethyl Fumarate ) different phase development . However attenuate disease ( reduce number relapse per year ) cure . Also , beneficial ~40 % Relapsing -Remitting patient . Currently treatments patient Progressive Disease - gradual increase disability ( Murray 2006 ) . Intravenous steroid short term treatment acute relapse . In addition long term immunomodulatory drug , disease modify drug ( DMD ) , also drug use alleviate MS symptom , Provigil , fatigue Fampyra improvement walk disability . With grow number drug available treatment MS symptom , evaluation treatment success essential best treatment fit individual . Presently , objective tool assessment treatment efficiency . MRI expensive procedure add much information beyond clinical exam . CSF ( cervical spine fluid ) invasive painful examination help MS diagnosis related disease course . Treatment evaluation base mainly two parameter : disability ( measure EDSS ) annual relapse rate . Both measure disadvantage : 1 ) EDSS indicate mostly motorical disability take account implication disease , cognitive problem fatigue , 2 ) number relapse per year may differ among neurologist , since generally relapse indication steroid treatment take consideration steroid indication variates among neurologist . Over past year grow involvement patient healthcare note . Healthcare organization recognize importance involvement increase public demand patient involvement consider positive health system , specially chronic disease . Patient Reported Outcome-PRO define `` evaluation treatment success base patient point view '' . The patient grade intensity symptom related disease side effect treatment report general well help measure Health-Related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) . PRO useful measure treatment evaluation reason : First , patient today expect know drug side effect medical staff point view also view patient take drug ( Basch 2010 ) . Secondly , one big challenge today management MS treatment adherence . It show 50 % patient discontinue disease modify therapy complete two year treatment ( Bruce Lynch 2011 ) . PRO could contribute identification reason non-adherence allow intervention adherence improvement . The main difficulty collect PRO : 1 ) patient capability relate physician encounter relevant symptom since last visit , 2 ) fact patient 's report compare adherence therapy . Recently FDA , recognize importance use PRO , found consortium develop evaluate PRO ( Riazi 2006 ; Goldman 2010 ) . An electronic diary ( e-diary ) tailor person MS develop . The diary Internet application use web iphones . Data medical history , drug intake , drug side effect disease symptom ( include intensity ) enter user . The application produce graph base data enter send reminder user 's email cellular phone . It give physician complete insight patient adherence outcome accord patient 's view . A similar diary person epilepsy use thousand person past two year ( http : //my.epilepsy.com/irody/login-page.php ) ( Fisher 2010 ; Le 2011 ) . In face importance patient involvement medical decision since objective measure treatment success Multiple Sclerosis use routinely , electronic diary contribute evaluation therapy , regard efficiency safety . Aim ( ) The main aim study assess contribution use e-diary people MS : 1 . Adherence therapy ; 2 . Quality life clinical outcome ; 3 . Collection data disease symptom , treatment side-effects , PRO relevance clinical decision making . A second aim study ass e-diary usability . Research hypothesis Patient use electronic diary contribute patient adherence treatment clinical outcome allow collection reliable data symptom , side effect treatment outcome patient point view . Work plan outline : MS Patients , visit Multiple Sclerosis Center Carmel Medical Center treat DMD symptomatic drug MS invite participate study . After recruitment signing inform consent study , participant randomize two group : first one , study group , access MS patient e-diary one year , parallel continue receive standard medical follow-up . The second one , control group , receive standard medical care . Participants group ask fill questionnaire demographic data , quality life therapy adherence . The e-diary allows data entry retrieval computer iPhones . Users enter data medication , medical visit , drug side effect , receive reminder produce graphic textual report data enter . Participants use diary one year detail use automatically collect . In end period , clinical personal data group baseline one year two group compare . Users ' medical team satisfaction e-diary evaluate . Study plan : Number participant : 100 MS patient . MS patient recruit MS center clinic Carmel Medical Center receive explanation Prof. Miller , attend neurologist authorize Prof Miller , study aim protocol , sign informed consent , include release Clalit Health Services responsibility regard information security . Participants randomize two group : first one , study group , access MS patient e-diary one year , parallel continue receive standard medical follow-up . The second one , control group , receive standard medical care . Information regard personal family medical history , include data demographic ethnicity data , data smoke dietary habit , vitamin intake , disease , education occupation collect group via `` Personal information questionnaire '' . Participants also fill MSTAQ ( Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Adherence Questionnaire ) questionnaire adherence treatment baseline , 6 month one year , MSQoL-54 ( Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life-54 Instrument ) questionnaire quality life baseline one year . Medical staff fill `` Clinical questionnaire '' detail patient clinical status prior study Clinical Follow-up questionnaire '' 6 month one year . These questionnaire fill print form participant visit clinic . When necessary , data also collect medical record . Data collect participant physician fill form medical record store Excel Access data base . In addition , data regard use diary automatically collect . Use electronic diary : Participants study group receive code access e-diary computer iPhone . Participants n't I-phone may grant one study period . The data enter diary maintain secured Internet server include identify data . The diary collect data : - Medical data : information disease , treatment attend physician - Diary : daily report drug intake , symptoms intensity additional relevant data - Reminders : application send reminder drug intake medical appointment cellular phone email - Reports : textual graphical report data diary create The e-diary developed patient use data enter automatically accessed medical staff . Patients instruct bring report produce diary medical appointment . In addition , patient instruct contact phone medical staff clinic case feel change and/or deterioration medical condition , habitual clinic.Participants study group receive instruction use diary technical assistance available study . Follow-up diary 's use take 1 year . The medical follow-up participant usual MS center group . Data regarding use diary collect directly application , include : - Number entries - Duration entry - Frequency pattern use - Pages visit - Time elapsed clinical event report clinical staff - Access computer Iphone - Adherence treatment - Clinical relate data Participants show low/no access application contact medical team encourage use diary . These contact take consideration statistical analysis . After follow-up period participant study group medical staff fill `` Questionnaire Diary evaluation '' regard satisfaction tool . Medical staff fill `` Clinical follow-up questionnaire '' two group . Data analysis In end follow-up period , data collect directly application data questionnaire analyze follow : 1 ) Adherence treatment : In study group , adherence treatment assess data register e-diary questionnaire apply baseline , six month one year . In control group , adherence treatment assess questionnaire . Questionnaires two group compare . In addition , study group questionnaire adherence compare data adherence register e-diary . 2 ) Health-related quality life clinical outcome : Clinical data EDSS , number relapse hospitalization collect questionnaire complete medical team . Quality life assess questionnaire complete two group baseline one year result compare . Since patient ask visit clinic call medical team beyond regular follow-up feel necessary , number visit call two group compare . 3 ) Data capture e-diary : Data enter study group e-diary compare data enter Electronic Medical Record medical team regular follow-up control group .
