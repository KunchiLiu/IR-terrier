	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) one lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Life threaten manifestation acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) sudden cardiac death important cause death many country . Cardiac troponin biomarker high specificity cardiac necrosis recommend diagnosis acute myocardial infarction Universal definition myocardial infarction . Since new generation high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay become commercially available year ago , myocardial infarction detect earlier even small AMIs , classify unstable angina pectoris ( UAP ) less sensitive assay , detectable . On side , patient acute chronic myocardial damage due AMI identify . Thereby , reason elevate troponin level seek actively , high troponin level associate adverse outcome - independent underlying pathomechanism . The reason troponin elevation patient stable CAD clear yet . Associations extensive atherosclerosis , carotid lesion complex coronary plaque coronary CT scan report . Therefore , patient elevate troponin level represent risk population might profit intensified secondary prevention . In context , ticagrelor might part prevention strategy currently test PEGASUS trial . We plan conduct single-centre pilot study cohort clinically stable patient outpatient clinic , data regard prevalence , cause prognosis elevate troponin value unselected cohort sparse . Therefore , patient ( n=910 ) present outpatient clinic 12 month introduction high-sensitivity troponin T assay ( june 2009 ) free complaint present UAP enrol . All patient characterize demographic , laboratory clinical characteristic ( include medication ) available image data ( exercise-ecg , echocardiography , stress-echocardiography , compute tomography , cardiac MRI coronary angiography ) order compare baseline characteristic troponin positive troponin negative patient . In addition , Framingham- PROCAM-Score represent establish calculator long-term risk prediction calculate . Prognostic endpoint define severe cardiovascular event progress initially diagnose disease . Those endpoint associate initial hs-cTnT value serial change .</brief_summary>
