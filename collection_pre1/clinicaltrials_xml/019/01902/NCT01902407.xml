	<brief_summary>The purpose research study develop way predict computer surgery airway affect night time breathe call Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) child Down Syndrome . Subjects research study approximately year . Participation research study involve screen visit 1 overnight sleep study ( PSG ) research purpose do airway surgery . During research sleep study , measurement take airway resistance . A research measurement airway resistance also do clinical sleep MRI . The airway resistance measurement take 10 minute do sleep . The airway resistance measurement call critical closing pressure ( Pcrit ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proof-of-concept study determine dynamic computational model use predict surgical outcome . If result study positive , use help design large subsequent study . The purpose research develop computational model simulate OSA different surgical treatment OSA child young adult DS . Thus , population study child young adult DS persistent OSA despite previously undergone T &amp; A . Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) occur 50-100 % patient Down syndrome ( DS ) significantly cause exacerbate medical problem patient . Current surgical management child DS imperfect . There variable surgical success rate first line surgery palatine tonsillectomy adenoidectomy ( T &amp; A ) well secondary surgery perform T &amp; A fail . There critical need diagnostic modality take account airway anatomy , tissue compliance , collapsibility able predict surgical outcome improve surgical planning patient . Our central hypothesis upper airway flow-structure interaction ( FSI ) model use three-dimensional ( 3-D ) computational simulation dynamic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI MR ) data use predict surgical outcome child DS OSA despite previous T &amp; A . The long-term goal improve surgical outcome child Down syndrome OSA create accurate FSI predictive model . Such diagnostic tool would help tailor surgical procedure effective well identify avoid unnecessary unhelpful surgical procedure . These create model future adjust applied population OSA . Our specific aim include : 1 ) In child Down syndrome persistent OSA despite previous T &amp; A , collect data characterize upper airway anatomy , tissue compliance , collapsibility ; 2 ) generate validate individualize dynamic FSI model child 3 ) use validated dynamic computational model predict success surgical treatment child Down syndrome persistent OSA despite previous T &amp; A . This work innovative us dynamic rather static MR image data applies unique computational model accurately capture unsteadiness flow account interaction airflow surround airway flexible structure . Research component involve two part project . The first generation , validation use computational model MRI data . The second measure critical closing pressure ( Pcrit ) DS subject least three month post T &amp; A , OSA evaluate possible additional airway surgery . The measurement Pcrit do research PSG ( Sleep Center ) clinical sleep MRI ( MRI suite ) . Pcrit measurement acquire use Continuous Positive Air Pressure ( CPAP ) mask sleep . Additionally , measure improvement OSA base quality life ( QOL ) sleep , Obstructive Sleep Apnea questionnaire ( OSA18 ) administer preoperatively postoperatively .</detailed_description>
