	<brief_title>Comparison Two Needle Insertion Techniques Success Rate Complications During Central Venous Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unintended arterial puncture local hematoma formation common complication internal jugular vein central venous catheterization . Other serious complication like pseudoaneurysm , arteriovenous fistula , arterial dissection , thrombosis , embolism also possible . These complication mostly occur mechanical trauma injury advance needle back forth puncture internal jugular vein . Placement guidewire dilator also cause mechanical trauma injury around vessel . Because internal jugular vein collapse easily needle advance , anterior posterior wall vessel puncture simultaneously . Posterior wall puncture increase risk complication catheterization . Delicate puncture vessel stable fixation needle puncture important reduce overall number catheterization attempt , increase success rate , reduce complication . Seldinger technique ( thin-wall needle technique ) commonly used procedure obtain safe access central vein . The desired vessel puncture sharp hollow needle , syringe detach guidewire advanced lumen needle , needle withdrawn . Central catheter pass guidewire vessel . Contrarily , modify Seldinger technique ( guide sheath-over-the-needle technique ) use needle cover guide sheath . After desired vessel puncture , guide sheath instantly slide needle vessel . The needle withdrawn , guidewire advance guide sheath , central catheter place vessel . When use Seldinger technique , important fix needle firmly hand guidewire place vessel lumen . If hand fixation stable , needle tip migrate lumen , pierce vessel wall , carotid artery puncture , local hematoma formation might occur . Even evidence complication , blood regurgitation fail , overall number vessel puncture attempt would increase expect rate complication catheterization would increase . When use modify Seldinger technique , guide sheath easily slide needle , provide stable route vessel lumen relatively early step catheterization . Therefore , expect stability fixation improve , success rate catheterization increase , complication catheterization decrease . But high level evidence yet , still decision use technique base experience operator . Investigators go compare Seldinger technique modify Seldinger technique success rate complication central venous catheterization prospective , randomize , control study .</detailed_description>
