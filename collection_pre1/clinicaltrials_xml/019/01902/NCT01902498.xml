	<brief_summary>Cardiac bypass surgery important treatment patient severely blocked artery ( tubes delivery oxygen nutrient heart ) . Hundreds thousand operation do year help relieve patient ' chest pain prevent future heart attack . The surgery do `` bypassing '' blood flow around badly clogged artery sew healthy vessel another part body ( usually leg chest ) . Aspirin ( blood thinner ) give patient day surgery stop `` sticky '' cell blood ( platelet ) block new vessel ( may lead future heart attack ) . Research show aspirin work well people bypass surgery investigator might expect ( reason fully understood ) . One reason aspirin may work well surgery body make many platelet surgery would normal circumstance . All new platelet overwhelm aspirin continue `` sticky '' ready block artery . The investigator believe give multiple daily dos aspirin follow bypass surgery effective block platelet activity give aspirin daily .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Daily Doses Aspirin Overcome Hyporesponsiveness Post Cardiac Bypass Surgery ( ASACABG ) - Part B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiovascular disease cause athero-thrombosis number one cause long-term morbidity death worldwide . Many patient advance coronary disease benefit Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) improve symptom increase longevity . However , benefit CABG surgery attenuate early graft failure . The administration aspirin post-operative period show randomize control trial ( RCT ) reduce risk graft occlusion , although rate remain unacceptably high . Patients undergo CABG surgery transiently develop aspirin resistance , likely contributes vein graft failure . The investigator believe aspirin resistance consequence rapid platelet turnover early postoperative period , result large number platelet unexposed aspirin ( due short half life ) . The investigator hypothesize increase frequency aspirin dosing , investigator reverse aspirin resistance encounter post CABG surgery . The investigator propose RCT compare two different dos aspirin ( 81mg 325mg daily ) 162mg BID determine whether multiple daily dose overcome aspirin resistance . ( 1 ) Given platelet production increase many-fold CABG surgery ( short half-life aspirin ) , investigator hypothesize increase frequency aspirin dose lead acetylation great number platelet course day lead improved antiplatelet effect ( measure serum thromboxane platelet aggregation assay ) ; ( 2 ) The investigator examine three platelet-related single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) implicate aspirin hyporesponsiveness . The investigator propose single centre , randomize , open-label , RCT 60 patient undergoing elective urgent CABG surgery , receive ASA 81mg daily , 325mg daily 162mg bid start day 1 post-operatively . All patient receive 325mg 6hrs following procedure ( day operation ) long contraindication antiplatelet therapy ( ie significant bleeding ) - per investigator centre 's standard clinical practice . Further detail aspirin administration outcome measurement report .</detailed_description>
