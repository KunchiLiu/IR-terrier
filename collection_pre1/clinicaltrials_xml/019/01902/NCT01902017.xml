	<brief_summary>Injured joint , especially elbow , risk permanent motion loss , also know joint contracture . Joint contracture limit function elbow recognize complication occur often traumatic injury . The benefit early motion injury help prevent joint contracture still several patient develop debilitate joint contracture . Current research suggest mast cell , find joint , key cause joint contracture . Research do use medication call Ketotifen . Ketotifen link stabilize mast cell prevent joint contracture . It hop short-term use medication injury prevent contracture occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals ≥ 18 year old isolate distal 1/3 humerus and/or proximal 1/3 ulna and/or proximal 1/3 radius fracture and/or elbow dislocation ( open fracture without nerve injury may include ) present Peter Lougheed Centre ( PLC ) . Patients required take Ketotifen 5mg mouth twice day 6 week placebo twice day mouth 6 week . Neither patient physician caring know take Ketotifen placebo . Sometimes type injury require surgery . This study invite patient require surgery participate . We take sample blood measure tryptase ( normally find body ) . We predict people high level tryptase likely develop stiffen joint . Patients ask return follow visit 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 52 week surgery date initial injury surgery require . These visit part normal care type injury . At visit patient ask follow , part normal care . At visit : Range motion elbow assess , DASH score completed- form help research group understand level disability injury , X-rays fracture consider heal ( normal treatment ) , SF12 - questionnaire patient feel cop injury , Additional information collect injury heal weight measure . The patient require physiotherapy normal treatment injury . The patient contact telephone week 1 , 3 , 4 5 take study medication . During time : The patient ask : - problem study medication - new condition concern develop The patient remind : - next visit - continue take study drug instruct During telephone contact , problem detect rectified figure telephone interview , patient may ask attend Cast clinic see doctor person .</detailed_description>
