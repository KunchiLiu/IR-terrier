	<brief_title>A Crossover Study Evaluate Effect JNJ-54452840 Pharmacodynamics Metoprolol Tartrate Immediate-Release Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , single-center , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) 2-period crossover ( participant may receive different intervention sequentially trial ) study JNJ-54452840 metoprolol tartrate healthy participant . The duration study 7 week per participant 1 year participant develop anti-beta 1-AR ( adrenergic receptor ) auto-antibodies ( auto-antibodies target human beta-1-AR , antibody type protein help protect body foreign matter , bacteria virus ) . The study consist 3 part : Screening ( , 14 day study commences Day 1 ) ; Treatment ( consist either metoprolol IR JNJ-54452840 metoprolol IR Placebo 8 day , subsequent two-treatment period , separate wash-out period 2-7 day ) ; Follow-up ( , 7-10 day last study dose safety assessment ; follow another visit 21-28 day last study dose assessment anti beta-1-AR auto-antibodies blood ) . Any potential interaction JNJ-54452840 metoprolol tartrate IR primarily evaluate measure exercise induced heart rate ( , post exercise ) . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study . If beta-1-AR-auto-antibodies detect follow visit 21-28 day last treatment period study procedure , additional testing perform every 3 month auto-antibody level fall level detection assay 1 year , whichever occur early .</detailed_description>
