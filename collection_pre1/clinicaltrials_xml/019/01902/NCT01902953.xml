	<brief_summary>45 patient undergoing colon ( large bowel/intestine ) removal operation diagnosis colon cancer include study . During colon operation affect portion colon remove . In addition , lymph node include specimen evaluate pathologist . Analysis lymph node specimen important important aspect determine stage cancer . Once standard technique use colon removal operation specimen remove injected two drug help identify lymph node . One blue dye radiotracer . The colon ALL lymph node send standard pathologic evaluation . The patient never inject drug use research . Following standard lymph node evaluation , additional pathologist outside research facility examine lymph node specimen use depth technique beyond standard care . The result pathologic test convey surgeon record help decision make regard treatment . The study hypothesis radiotracer least effective blue dye identify lymph node likely harbor cancer cell ( sentinel node ) . Once identify , sentinel node undergo depth review lead improved staging colorectal cancer accurate treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lymphoseek® Lymphoid Tissue Targeting Agents Colon Cancer ( CNC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study single center , open-label , within patient 's tissue ex vivo comparative study Lymphoseek ( Lymphoseek ( Technetium Tc 99m Tilmanocept ) radiotracer accumulate lymphatic tissue bind mannose bind receptor resides surface dendritic cell macrophage . Lymphoseek diameter 5 nm , substantially small current radiolabeled agent use target lymphoid tissue . Lymphoseek 's small diameter permit enhance diffusion lymph node blood capillary , result rapid injection site clearance . Upon entry blood , agent bind receptor liver filter kidney accumulates bladder . ) vital blue dye ( Patent Bleu V ) detection excise lymph nodes patient know cancer colon . The colon segment tumor anticipate involved nodal bed remove intact . After surgical procedure complete , specimen instantly take extra table operating room . It perform specimen take . The colonic specimen incise longitudinally antimesenteric side . Lymphatic mapping employ specimen use first injection Lymphoseek ( 50 µg/2 mCi ) 0.1-1.0 ml , follow 15-30 min 1 ml 1 % blue dye , inject subserosally submucosally around tumor ( peritumoral site employ ) use tuberculin syringe . After 5-7 minute massage little circulatory movement lesion , mark agent move lymphatic path sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) mesentery . By low level diathermy , sharp dissection lymphatic path ( ) SLN ( ) may existent . Blue node shall remove first visual inspection . This inspection dissection shall last longer 20 minute . Each blue node assess count well color `` hot '' rule ( 3σ ) apply describe . Following blue node removal , sentinel lymph node remove basin mark specimen submit pathologic appraisal . The Lymphoseek-designated ( localize ) lymph node define lymph node gamma detector count great sum 3 square root mean background count ( i.e. , standard deviation ) add mean background count . This refer hereafter `` 3σ rule '' `` threshold criterion '' . If gamma detector use obtain gamma count three 2-second interval , one 10-second count may use detect gamma count . Any lymph node count meeting threshold criterion consider negative ( non-localized ) finding . The background count may obtain take 2-second count 10 second count handheld gamma probe extend least 100 cm away injection site probe point away anyLymphoseek source ( syrinx , injection site , isotope-contaminated material ) . Probing area complete select node count negative use threshold criterion . The surgeon continue visualization palpation accord local practice ensure grossly positive lymph node remain site resection . To confirm vivo procedure , assessment presence blue hue set three 2-second count one 10-second count record excised lymph node . The mean count ex vivo lymph node compare mean room background count , threshold criterion use determine positive finding vivo node apply ex vivo specimen . All remove lymph node send pathology evaluation . All lymph node undergo enhanced pathological evaluation include serial sectioning H &amp; E stain well immunohistochemical ( IHC ) markers A- The primary objective efficacy concordance vivo detection rate Lymphoseek VBD excise lymph node tissue phenotype confirm histology . B- The primary objective assessment excise lymph node ( ) confirm presence/absence tumor metastases node contrast pathology finding per agent-found node versus non-agent-based remove node . Secondary evaluation include localization rate ( identification hot and/or blue node ) , degree localization ( node number/patient 's ex vivo total tissue ) , count localize per node , time localization stabilization .</detailed_description>
