	<brief_summary>The aim project : 1 . Determine 3-weeks dietary supplementation NOPE-EGCG ( PhosphoLEANtm , 85mg NOPE+50mg EGCG per capsule ) versus placebo improve performance impulsivity , go/no-go task negative outcome learn heavy drinker . 2 . Evaluate whether supplementation NOPE-EGCG versus placebo result reduction alcohol consumption . 3 . Preliminary data rodent model suggest rat treat OEA shift preference low fat test stimulus . In aim 3 Determine 3-weeks supplementation PhosphoLEAN shift fat preference towards low fat test pudding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Similarities striatocortical pathway dysfunction note alcoholism obesity . In prior study demonstrate inverse relationship body mass index response dorsal striatum ( DS ) consumption palatable milkshake [ 1 ] . We also show magnitude reduce response predicts weight gain , especially individual carry copy A1 allele taq1A polymorphism [ 1 ] . Since A1 allele associate reduced striatal D2 receptor [ 2-7 ] , find implicates dopamine system reduce blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) response . Our result also indicate reduce response consequence , rather cause obesity , since gain weight [ 8 ] , risk obesity [ 9 ] ( virtue parental obesity ) , associate reduce DS response palatable food . Taken together result indicate increased adiposity associate blunt DS response palatable food may reflect altered dopamine signal . More recently determine reduced DS response overweight obese subject associate increased impulsivity measure BIS-11 go no/no-go task [ 10 ] . Heavy drinker also likely impulsive [ 11 ] . In preliminary analysis data 300 individual assess clinical core battery Center Translational Neuroscience Alcoholism ( CTNA ) , find high score BIS-11 measure impulsivity associate great alcohol consumption . Related finding human , preliminary work rodent show exogenous administration N-Acylethanolamines , oleoylethanolamine ( OEA ) normalize high-fat diet induce dopamine decrease DS . Human test OEA supplementation possible base availability dietary supplement contain OEA precursor NOPE-EGCG ( ( PhosphoLEANtm , 85mg NOPE+50mg EGCG per capsule ) . PhosphoLEAN show enhance adherence dietary advice overweight healthy subject [ 12-14 ] . We therefore propose pilot study test whether PhosphoLEAN improve performance impulsivity , go/no-go task negative outcome learning . Specifically , recruit heavy drinker likely impulsive [ 11 ] . Phospholean may improve negative reinforcement learn population . This may lead reduction drink well . We also explore whether supplement lead reduction alcohol consumption preference high fat food .</detailed_description>
