	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety dabrafenib combination Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 ( GSK2141795 ) select optimal dose GSK2141795 phase II portion patient BRAF mutant cancer . ( This trial proceed Phase II study dabrafenib GSK2141795 , move evaluation triple therapy ) ( Phase I ) II . To assess safety dabrafenib trametinib GSK2141795 combination select optimal dose combination Phase II Portion patient BRAF mutant cancer . ( Phase I ) III . To evaluate objective response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) patient BRAF^V600 mutant metastatic melanoma previously progress BRAF^V600 inhibitor-based therapy ( BRAFi ) , BRAFi + MEK inhibitor-based therapy ( MEKi ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival progression-free survival . II . To assess toxicity profile recommend phase II dose . III . To assess response ( complete partial , confirm unconfirmed ) patient enrol phase I portion ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore molecular mechanism acquire resistance BRAF inhibitor therapy use available biopsy lesion progress prior BRAF inhibitor-based therapy . II . To explore potential drug-drug interaction dabrafenib GSK2141795 lead change expect exposure either agent compare prior experience . ( Phase I ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 follow phase II study . Dose escalation dabrafenib , trametinib , Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 initiate completion dabrafenib + GSK2141795 phase I dose escalation . Dabrafenib Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 : Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Dabrafenib , trametinib , Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID , trametinib PO QD , Akt inhibitor GSK2141795 PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
