	<brief_title>An Efficacy Tolerability Study Bortezomib Combination With Rituximab Standard Therapy Participants With Relapsed Refractory Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective ( study follow participant forward time ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multi-center ( conducted 1 center ) , non-randomized ( study drug assign chance ) , single-arm study participant relapse refractory cluster differentiation 20 plus ( CD-20+ ) follicular Grade 1 2 lymphoma Stage III IV least 2 previous line therapy . The study include 2 phase : Screening phase Treatment phase . The Screening phase conduct 2 week Treatment phase . The Treatment phase include 3 cycle . The duration cycle 5 week ( 35 day ) . After second cycle , response evaluate . In case complete response ( CR ) , participant followed-up period 1 year . In case progressive disease ( PD ) , participant exclude study , case stable disease ( SD ) partial response ( PR ) , additional cycle 5 week apply follow-up 1 year perform . In cycle , participant receive 1.6 milligram per meter square ( mg per m^2 ) bortezomib intravenous ( vein body ) infusion ( fluid medicine deliver vein way needle ) Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , Days 36 , 43 , 50 57 Cycle 2 Days 71 , 78 , 85 92 Cycle 3 ( applicable ) . Cycle 3 applicable case SD PR accord remission criterion Cycle 2 . In Cycles 2 ( applicable ) 3 , injection bortezomib follow administration rituximab ( dose 375 mg per m^2 ) give intravenous infusion . If neuropathy ( disturbance function brain spinal cord may affect nerve muscle body ) grade equal 2 occur dose bortezomib reduce 1.6 mg per m^2 1.3 mg per m^2 1.0 mg per m^2 . Participants analyzed time disease progression relapse , disease free survival , overall survival remission ( medical problem get good go away least ) status . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
