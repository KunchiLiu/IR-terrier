	<brief_summary>This study conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) 400 subject ( woman &amp; partner ) seek pre-conception carrier test assess impact program use Whole Genome Sequencing ( WGS ) . 1 . The investigator hypothesize whole genome sequence increase detection carrier status Mendelian recessive x-linked condition . 2 . The investigator hypothesize parent act knowledge carrier status make different reproductive choice parent receive information . 3 . The investigator hypothesize psychosocial risk increase among parent receive expand carrier screen use Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) compare usual care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project 1-Clinical Intervention Outcomes Aim 1 : To conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) 400 subject ( woman &amp; partner ) seek pre-conception carrier test assess impact program use Whole Genome Sequencing ( WGS ) . Aim 2 : To develop process deliver information WGS directly patient 's electronic medical record , establish innovative reporting strategy informative clinician couple act information . Aim 3 : To measure integration sequence information clinical care carrier status secondary finding include : 1 . Patient report outcome ( PRO ) impact quality life , satisfaction care , timeliness reporting , use genomic information . 2 . Process outcomes timeliness , number reportable finding , time interpretation . Project 2 -WGS technology , informatics , Return Results Committee ( RORC ) Aim 1 : To generate whole genome sequence interpret variant sample randomize Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) preconception carrier screen cohort . 1 . To perform whole genome sequencing , assembly , variant detection sample . 2 . To provide variant data sample annotation rank clinical significance . 3 . To validate data use orthogonal platform finding relevant carrier status actionable secondary finding . Aim 2 : To develop implement return result committee ( RORC ) incorporate evidence ass criterion report carrier status reproductive decision make secondary finding . Project 3 - Ethical Psychosocial Implications Aim 1 : To evaluate , patient clinical perspective informational need , satisfaction , knowledge , decision-making relating choice obtain result carrier status WGS four category genetic condition . Aim 2 : To evaluate , patient clinician perspective , immediate downstream ethical , psychosocial , behavioral consequence expand carrier screen use WGS . Aim 3 : To evaluate impact expand carrier test use WGS subsequent health care utilization , compare cost delivery WGS usual care .</detailed_description>
