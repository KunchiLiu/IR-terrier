	<brief_summary>Although frequent lethal complication patient ( pt ) hematologic malignancy , diagnose invasive aspergillosis ( IA ) still remain difficult issue culture-based method show low sensitivity especially current clinical practice antifungal prophylaxis rapid antifungal therapy . In certain clinical setting , perform biopsy identification underlie infectious organism become important . However , culture-based method yield result minority patient , use non-culture-based method like Aspergillus specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) detection IA directly clinical specimen become increasingly important might help characterize causative pathogen . Therefore performance establish Aspergillus-specific nest PCR biopsy , re-section material pleural effusion evaluate .</brief_summary>
