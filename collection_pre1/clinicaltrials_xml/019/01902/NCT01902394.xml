	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine substitute whole grain refine grain diet healthy adult period 6 week alters composition bacteria gut , beneficial effect immune function , digestive health , cardiovascular health , regulation body weight composition , vitamin K status . The investigator hypothesize whole grain consumption period 6 week alter gut microflora toward beneficial bacterial profile , improve immune response reduce oxidative stress inflammatory marker , favorable effect factor influence regulation body weight composition , increase bacterial vitamin K synthesis , beneficially effect surrogate marker cholesterol synthesis/absorption , vitamin D concentration , whole genome DNA methylation pattern . In statin user hypothesize , consumption whole grain alter statin pharmacokinetics decrease rate statin absorption , result sustain plasma concentration .</brief_summary>
