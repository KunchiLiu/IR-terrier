	<brief_summary>Traumatic injury rural America significant cause morbidity mortality , challenge rural trauma system put patient unique risk . Prolonged transport time trauma center , stop care refer hospital , long exposure care-associated factor distinguish rural patient urban counterpart . Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) significant risk rural patient , increase hospital stay , healthcare cost , even mortality critically injure . The investigator propose pilot study test hypothesis single dose oral chlorhexidine gluconate ( antiseptic ) trauma patient prehospital environment decrease subsequent development early VAP . Chlorhexidine currently standard therapy intensive care unit prevent airway colonization subsequent development VAP . Demonstrating safety effectiveness prehospital infection control practice could significantly improve outcomes traumatic injury rural America .</brief_summary>
