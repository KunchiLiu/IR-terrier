	<detailed_description>According World Malaria Report , significant decrease number P.falciparum ( PF ) malaria case worldwide past decade . On Thai-Myanmar border transmission low seasonal incidence Multi-drugs resistant P.falciparum parasites high , trend observe clear decline malaria episode ratio P. falciparum/P . vivax ( PF/PV ) .

It seem large number asymptomatic carrier low parasite count ( large potential malaria reservoir ) go undetected . If confirm , might pose great obstacle malaria elimination region containment artemisinin resistance . The purpose survey study understand epidemiology malaria refugee camp population use cutting-edge technology ( RT-PCR ) . The necessity research Humans With double mission malaria elimination artemisinin-resistance containment , intensive malaria activity currently implement refugee camp Tak province ( province Thailand Thai-Burmese border ) . The malaria risk among refugee camp high Thai residence inside Thailand . To avoid resource wastage , thus essential conduct simple questionnaire understand current situation malaria prevention camp , especially information regard mosquito net ownership usage ( mosquito net distribution major malaria prevention activity among NGOs camp ) . PCR method use recent year due sensitivity compare slide read . PCR consider able capture case sub-microscopic infection . However , current PCR method conventionally use malaria survey usually use finger prick obtain microliters capillary blood , detectable level parasitaemia therefore limit due minimal amount blood Plasmodium DNA extract . Thus RT-PCR method propose use 2ml venous blood well compensate shortcoming . The comparison test result conventional microscopy ( currently still universal golden standard clinic ) RT-PCR enable detection symptomatic asymptomatic malaria case help define epidemiology apart conventional understanding malaria . Thus study necessary strategically important next roadmap development malaria elimination resistance containment .</detailed_description>
