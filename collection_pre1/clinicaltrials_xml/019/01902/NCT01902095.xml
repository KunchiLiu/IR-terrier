	<brief_summary>Dental plaque , know dental biofilm , implicate primary etiological agent responsible oral inflammatory disease . Matured form dental plaque play major role pathogenicity gingivitis ; manage early stage result cascade event lead destruction periodontal tissue . Effective plaque control technique suggest maintain dental biofilm level compatible oral health cornerstone preventive strategy control oral disease particularly gingivitis . To clean teeth ensure effective plaque control , different mechanical mean use since century . However inadequacy plaque removal , different antimicrobial antiplaque agent introduce oral-care product . The use dentifrices recommended year ultimate way prevent incidence oral disease . Dentifrices anti-plaque anti-gingivitis capability due composition . Toothpastes less extent toothpowder common oral-care product use eliminate plaque deposit tooth surface . Existent literature focus toothpaste mouth rinse derelicts toothpowder despite difference owe absence humectant . With intention advance knowledge issue well close research gap , study conduct evaluate efficacy toothpowder alleviate gingivitis , control dental plaque , inhibit extrinsic stain . A single-blind , parallel arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate efficacy toothpowder toothpaste oral hygiene parameter plaque stain deposit teeth gingival inflammation . Plaque Index , Lobene Stain Index Gingival Index use measure oral hygiene . The current RCT reveal toothpowder toothpaste equally effective treatment control group clinical perspective however toothpowder show statistically significant effectiveness compare toothpaste . Toothpowder , compose calcium carbonate essential oil , demonstrate statistically effective toothpaste control extrinsic dental staining , dental plaque gingival inflammation .</brief_summary>
