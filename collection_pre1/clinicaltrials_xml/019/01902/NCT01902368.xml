	<brief_title>Celiac Disease Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overall hypothesis first second degree relative individual celiac disease benefit screen diagnosis celiac disease . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . The number need test cost benefit one person though celiac disease screen within acceptable range 33 test &lt; $ 10,000 spend . 2 . Treatment lead adverse metabolic change . 3 . Intestinal biopsy unnecessary accurate diagnosis substantial subset adult . Aim 1 . Determine effect screen detect celiac disease health relate quality life . - Evaluate change health relate quality life one year participant randomize screen detect , early diagnosis cohort compare screen detect , delayed diagnosis , clinically detect non-celiac control cohort . - Evaluate change symptom , psychological well-being burden treatment one year screen detect , early diagnosis cohort compare screen detect , delayed diagnosis , clinically detect non-celiac control cohort . - Evaluate cost per diagnosis number need test diagnosis individual clinically meaningful improvement health relate quality life attributable treatment celiac disease . Aim 2 : Assess effect screen detect celiac disease nutritional metabolic index . - Compare change bone density , body mass index , Reynolds Cardiovascular Risk Score , nutritional index one year screen detect , early diagnosis cohort compare screen detect , delayed diagnosis , clinically detect non-celiac control cohort . Aim 3 : Evaluate reliability use serologic test combination intestinal fatty acid bind protein vs. intestinal biopsy confirm celiac disease diagnosis adult . - Prospectively assess sensitivity specificity novel non-invasive celiac diagnostic algorithm comparison current gold standard small intestinal biopsy histology . - Model cost modify , non-invasive celiac test vs. classical test endoscopic biopsy screen-detected clinically identify celiac disease .</detailed_description>
