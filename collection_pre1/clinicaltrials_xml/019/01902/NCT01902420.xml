	<brief_summary>Acromegaly rare disease cause growth hormone ( GH ) secrete pituitary adenoma 95 % case . Acromegaly see sporadically may associate variety genetic syndrome Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 , Carney Complex , familial isolate pituitary adenoma ( FIPA ) Mc-Cune Albright Syndrome . The accompany feature syndrome family history helpful differential diagnosis . Aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) -interacting protein ( AIP ) gene mutation see sporadically well FIPA . But prescience presence AIP mutation limit positive family history early-onset acromegaly . Furthermore , probability patient index case family ignore . Screening AIP gene mutation recommend patient pituitary adenomas childhood-onset , GH prolactin secrete tumor diagnose age 30 year positive family history two family member accord present evidence literature . It also know AIP mutation usually associate aggressive clinical behavior due unclarified reason . The prevalence AIP mutation Turkish population type mutation define previously . The primary aim present study define AIP gene mutation prevalence relation clinical tumour behaviour subgroup Turkish acromegalic patient . If AIP gene mutation detect patient , possible screen family patient presence AIP mutation least presence pituitary adenoma . Acromegalic patient follow Erciyes University Medical School Department Endocrinology enrol study . After DNA isolation , exon AIP gene include splice point reproduce polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analyze presence mutation sequence analysis . The case analyze mean clinical feature accord presence AIP gene mutation . The prevalence AIP gene mutation , clinical reflection presence AIP mutation determine genetic consultation give carrier AIP gene mutation end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening AIP gene mutation recommend patient pituitary adenomas childhood-onset , GH PRL secrete tumor diagnose age 30 year positive family history two family member accord present evidence literature . It also know AIP mutation usually associate aggressive clinical behavior due unclarified reason . The prevalence AIP mutation Turkish population type mutation define previously . The primary aim present study define AIP gene mutation prevalence relation clinical tumour behavior subgroup Turkish acromegalic patient . If AIP gene mutation detect patient , possible screen family patient presence AIP mutation least presence pituitary adenoma . Acromegalic patient follow Erciyes University Medical School Department Endocrinology enrol study . The clinical laboratory data record remission status patient determine . Each exon AIP gene include splice point reproduce PCR analyze presence mutation sequence analysis . Genomic DNA isolate peripheral blood sample acromegalic patient use QIAamp DNA blood mini kit ( QIA-GEN , Milano , Italy ) accord manufacturer 's instruction . Fifty nanograms genomic DNA ampliﬁed primer report . The entire AIP gene examine acromegaly patient healthy control group . Each AIP exon DNA sample ampliﬁed use PCR . Six AIP exon ampliﬁed use Thermo Taq DNA polymerase follow condition : initial denaturation 96°C 5 min , follow 34 cycle 94°C 45 , 60°C 45 , 72°C 1 min , ﬁnal extension step 72°C 7 min.PCR ampliﬁcations check 2 % agarose gel . PCR product purify PCR purification kit . Sequential alteration determine bidirectional sequencing . Six AIP exon sequence use Beckman CEQ 8000 . The case analyze mean clinical feature accord presence AIP gene mutation . The prevalence AIP gene mutation , clinical reflection presence AIP mutation determine genetic consultation give carrier AIP gene mutation end study .</detailed_description>
