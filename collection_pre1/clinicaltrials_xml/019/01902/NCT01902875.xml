	<brief_title>Preconditioning Chemotherapy Combination With Cytokine Induced Killer Cell ( CIK ) Immunotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer become one leading cause cancer relate death , increase morbidity mortality . And non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account 85 % lung cancer patient . Although molecule target therapy clinical use , overall treatment effect come expectation . It urgent explore new treatment regimen . Chemotherapy main modality treatment advance NSCLC , however , effect chemotherapy NSCLC reach plateau . Combination chemotherapy therapy prospective orientation cancer treatment research . It widely accept conflict relationship chemotherapy immunotherapy chemotherapeutics could destruct immune system . However , convince chemotherapy could modulate suppressive immune microenvironment up-regulate immunogenicity cancer cell , thereafter enhance anti-tumor effect immune system . Traditional chemotherapeutics cytotoxic drug , also immunity regulator . Increasing evidence indicate combination chemotherapy immunotherapy would show effective anti-tumor outcome . Adoptive cell immunotherapy one prospective treatment battle cancer . CIK cell heterogeneous cell population derive human peripheral blood mouse spleen vitro expansion interferon-γ , interleukin-2 anti-CD3 antibody . CIK cell mediate potent major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) -unrestricted cytotoxicity variety tumor cell recognize kill tumor cell without prior exposure prim . There two main subpopulation distinguish within bulk culture vitro expand CIK cell , one co-expressing CD3 cluster differentiation 56 ( CD56 ) molecule ( CD3+CD56+ ) present CD3+CD56- phenotype . The antitumor activity CIK cell report mainly restrict CD3+CD56+ cell . Adoptive CIK cell transfer , one adoptive immunotherapy represent promise nontoxic anticancer therapy treatment solid tumor refractory conventional therapy . However clinical study , therapeutic activity CIK cell transfer efficient anticipate , might cause tumor abnormal microenvironment , impede CIK cell infiltration cytotoxicity . Thus urgent find effective therapy enhance adoptive CIK cell efficacy improve clinical effect cancer patient . Tumor immunotherapy face numerous challenge systemic immune tolerance tumor local immune escape . In development immune system , T cell high affinity self-antigen clear negative selection thymus , well T cell bind self-antigen express tumor cell . However , immune suppression cell important tumor immune evading , regulatory T cell ( Treg cell ) play central role . T regulatory cell component immune system suppress immune response cell . This important `` self-check '' build immune system prevent excessive reaction . Regulatory T cell come many form well understood express cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) , cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) , Foxp3 , cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associate molecule-4 ( CTLA-4 ) glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor ( GITR ) . As far , Treg cell ' precise mechanism action still unclear , suppose include cell-cell contact secrete cytokine ( IL-10 , transform growth factor ( TGF ) -β ) . In addition , immunosuppressive cell , myeloid derive suppressor ( MDSC ) , play important role cancer immune escape . Tumor cell self could also inhibit anticancer immunoreaction low expression tumor associate antigen , low expression MHC-I molecular , defect co-activating signal activation Cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTL ) , secrete immunosuppressive cytokine , IL-10 TGF-β , express Fas ligand , tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis induce ligand ( TRAIL ) induce apoptosis effect cell . Paclitaxel ( PTX ) mitotic inhibitor use cancer chemotherapy . Paclitaxel stabilize microtubule result , interfere normal breakdown microtubule cell division . Together docetaxel , form drug category taxanes . PTX enhance antigen presentation induce tumor cell immunogenic apoptosis . PTX also activate dendritic cell toll-like receptor signal pathway initiate innate immune response . PTX also report induce T helper Type I cytokine production contribute effective cytotoxic T-cell response . While cisplatin ( DDP ) up-regulate expression NKG2D ligand ( NKG2DL ) tumor cell , thus sensitize tumor cell lysis NKG2D-expressing lymphocytes . DDP may also increase tumor cell expression Fas , thereby increase vulnerability Fas ligand ( FasL ) -positive immune effector . It report neoadjuvant chemotherapy PTX could induce infiltration tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) cell breast cancer , related clinical effect . Our previous work also indicate frequency intratumoral splenic regulatory T cell ( Treg cell ) significantly decrease intratumoral accumulation CD3+ T lymphocytes enhance chemotherapy pretreatment lung cancer model . Based previous work , clinical Trial propose explore whether precondition chemotherapy TP regimen ( PTX+DDP ) combine autologous adoptive CIK cell immunotherapy could benefit NSCLC patient well clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
