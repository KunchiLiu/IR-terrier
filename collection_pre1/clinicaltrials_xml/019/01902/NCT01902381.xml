	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study 6 , 8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid ( CPI-613 ) treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome fail previous therapy . Sometimes chemotherapy biological therapy give , stop growth tumor cell . The tumor say resistant treatment . 6 , 8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid may interfere growth tumor cell may effective treatment myelodysplastic syndrome respond previous therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes Who Failed Previous Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety anti-cancer activity CPI-613 myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) patient fail previous agent ( decitabine [ Dacogen ] , azacitidine [ Vidaza ] , growth factor lenalidomide ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive 6 , 8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 4 week 1-3 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
