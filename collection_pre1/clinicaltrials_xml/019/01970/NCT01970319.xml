	<brief_summary>Patients diabetes high incidence heart failure bad outcome normoglycaemic subject . Basic science research suggest many mechanism observation include endothelial dysfunction , abnormal calcium handling , fibrosis activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) , clinical data lack . In study investigator investigate relationship diabetes heart failure explore correlation microvascular dysfunction cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) marker leave ventricular ( LV ) hypertrophy , cardiac dysfunction fibrosis . The investigator also propose see relationship independent blood pressure marker RAAS activity . This could important clinical ramification type 2 diabetes increase indication treatment RAAS inhibition make case low blood pressure target .</brief_summary>
