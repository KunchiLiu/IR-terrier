	<brief_title>The Effect Repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Off-line Resting Electroencephalographic Signal Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon meet inclusion criterion provide informed consent , participant complete series 21 session rTMS course four weeks.During first visit , ask undergo 1 hour EEG ( Electroencephalograph ) start repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation session ( rTMS ) , 0.5-hour memory test use MoCA Trail Making Test ( Trial A B ) , 1 hour rTMS 1 hour EEG rTMS . The second visit start approximately 24-72 hour first visit . During visit 2 visit 20 , participant receive 1 hour TMS session 5 day week 4 week . During 21st visit , approximately one day last TMS session , participant ask repeat 1 hour EEG TMS ; 0.5-hour memory test use MoCA Trail Making Test ( Trial A B ) , 1 hour TMS 1 hour EEG TMS . For study , questionnaire concern potential side effect administrate session .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female , Age 5585 year old , Able consent agree participate ( patient capacity give consent caregiver ask ) Fluent English Diagnosed probable AD ( NINCDSADRDA criterion ) mild stage define composite score 1 less clinical dementia rating scale ( CDR ) Other neurological illness would interfere cognitive function ( significant stroke , seizure d/o , Parkinson , Huntington etc. ) . Psychiatric illness know affect cognition schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder , substance use disorder within 1 year study , active depression anxiety disorder history recurrent major mood disorder prior cognitive change . Medications : benzodiazepine exclusionary . Other psychotropic medication include Acetyl Choline Esterase inhibitor allow dose need stable least one month prior start study . Patients take medication might increase risk seizure participate study . Subjects metal anywhere head , exclude mouth , generally contraindication TMS . This include shrapnel , screw clip surgical procedure unless physical property metal object know strong reason use TMS . Subjects cardiac pacemaker implant medication pump participate TMS study . TMS also perform patient electrode inside heart might provide lowresistance current path electrically sensitive tissue . Persons serious heart disease increase risk event seizure , Persons increase intracranial pressure , acute large infarction trauma , also increase risk event seizure , receive TMS . Pregnant woman woman child bear age might pregnant . Patients already enrol another study .</criteria>
