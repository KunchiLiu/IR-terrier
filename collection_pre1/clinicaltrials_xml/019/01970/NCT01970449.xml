	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Three Different Prime-Boost HIV Vaccine Regimens Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , immune response three different HIV-1 prime-boost vaccine regimens healthy , HIV-1-uninfected adult . The regimen differ type HIV-1 envelope insert ( Nat-B env , CON-S env , Mosaic env ) contain DNA prime vaccine NYVAC boost vaccine . The study enroll 180 healthy , HIV-1-uninfected adult two stage ( Part A Part B ) . After Part A study fully enrol , study researcher evaluate study immunogenicity data determine whether enroll participant Part B . The study design vaccination schedule part study . Participants randomly assign one three group receive either one experimental vaccine regimens placebo vaccine regimen . Participants receive four total injection : Day 0 Day 28 ( DNA vaccine placebo ) Day 84 Day 168 ( NYVAC vaccine placebo ) . Group 1 participant receive DNA Nat-B env NYVAC Nat-B env vaccine , Group 2 participant receive DNA CON-S env NYVAC CON-S env vaccine , Group 3 participant receive DNA Mosaic env NYVAC Mosaic env vaccine . Total study duration either 3 year enrollment ( participant United States ) 5 year enrollment ( participant Switzerland ) . For participant , study visit occur Days 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 , 84 , 98 , 168 , 175 , 182 , 273 , 357 , 364 . After last study visit , participant contact annually phone e-mail total 3 ( U.S. participant ) 5 ( Switzerland participant ) year answer question health . At screen , participant give medical history ; undergo complete physical exam , blood collection , urine collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ; receive risk reduction counseling . At follow-up visit , participant undergo abbreviated physical exam , blood collection , urine collection , receive risk reduction counsel . Participants additional ECGs Days 98 182 . At visit , female participant bear female assessed pregnancy prevention , select visit , undergo pregnancy test .</detailed_description>
