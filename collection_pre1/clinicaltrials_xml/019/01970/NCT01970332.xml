	<brief_title>Mechanisms That Produce Leg Dysfunction Claudication ( Leg Pain Limping During Walking ) Treatment Strategies Care Patients With Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Claudication , define walking-induced leg discomfort gait dysfunction relieve rest , affect 5 % Americans 55 year age . Claudicating patient adopt sedentary lifestyle cluster extreme low end physical activity spectrum , escalate risk adverse health effect . The primary therapeutic goal claudicating patient restoration leg function prevention disease progression . Current , rehabilitative intervention focus inadequate blood flow cause claudication . Operative revascularization and/or exercise therapy principal conventional therapeutic modality , provide modest rehabilitative benefit . Applying biomechanical analysis gait claudicating patient , investigator team develop preliminary data indicate blood flow mechanism produce limb dysfunction claudication . Several laboratory include investigator demonstrate myopathy , characterized mitochondrial dysfunction , oxidative damage inflammation , leg skeletal muscle claudicating patient . These condition quantify , comprehensively , relation claudication , association severity claudication know . The investigator hypothesis blood flow restriction good predictor limb dysfunction claudication , whereas muscle mitochondrial dysfunction , oxidative damage inflammation strong predictor limb dysfunction baseline conventional therapy revascularization supervise exercise . Under Aim # 1 , investigator acquire precise measurement gastrocnemius mitochondrial function , oxidative damage inflammation claudicating patient , time initial presentation , evaluate measurement predictor objective measure limb function subjective measure quality life . Under Aims # 2 # 3 , investigator evaluate effect revascularization ( Aim # 2 ) supervise exercise therapy ( Aim # 3 ) mitochondrial dysfunction , oxidative damage inflammation claudicating gastrocnemius objective measure limb function subjective measure quality life . If investigator hypothesis correct , work Aim # 2 first time definitively demonstrate blood flow restriction due blockages arterial tree cause claudication . The work Aims # 2 # 3 determine whether revascularization exercise therapy beneficial effect myopathy claudicating muscle associate improvement limb function quality life . Finally , propose study Aims # 1 , # 2 # 3 provide quantitative modeling panel mechanistic ( bioenergetics , oxidative stress inflammation ) parameter predictor objective measurement claudicating limb function subjective measure quality life commonly use clinical assessment . Measurements gastrocnemius mitochondrial function , oxidative damage inflammation may useful tool permit stag disease optimum intervention evaluation therapeutic intervention specifically target condition , improve rehabilitative outcome .</detailed_description>
