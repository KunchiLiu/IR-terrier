	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate new type melanoma vaccine call `` Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine '' . The purpose study determine possible make administer safely vaccine melanoma use information gain specific characteristic participant 's melanoma . It known melanomas mutation ( change genetic material ) specific individual patient tumor . These mutation cause tumor cell produce protein appear different body 's cell . It possible protein use vaccine may induce strong immune response , may help participant 's body fight tumor cell could cause melanoma come back future . The study examine safety vaccine give several different time point examine participant 's blood cell sign vaccine induce immune response .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Patient willing able give write informed consent . Patient agreeable allow tumor normal tissue sample submit complete exome transcriptome sequencing . Pathologically confirm , clinically evident ( physical examination radiographic imaging ) stage IIIB , IIIC , IVM1a b cutaneous melanoma ( anatomic stage T14b N1a T14b N2a include ) . ) The current diagnosis may patient 's first diagnosis melanoma recurrent melanoma previous diagnosis earlier stage melanoma . Complete surgical resection metastatic disease ( lymph node , transit , satellite lesion ( ) , distant metastastases ) negative margin resect specimen confirm pathologic review perform , deem feasible treat surgical oncologist . Surgical resection primary melanoma may may perform . The patient must free unresectable metastatic disease within 4 week prior surgery perform intention remove melanoma . This presurgery baseline assessment must document complete physical examination image study . Imaging study must include total body PETCT conjunction brain MRI ( head CT brain MRI contraindicate ) . If PET/CT scan do , CT neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis perform . Patients may receive prior interferon alpha ( IFNα ) , must discontinue IFNα therapy within 4 week prior enrollment trial . Patients receive prior adjuvant therapy inform potential therapeutic benefit IFNα . Previous radiation therapy , include surgical resection , allow long 14 day elapse radiation initiation first vaccination NeoVax . Age ≥ 18 year . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 Normal organ bone marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,500/mcL Absolute lymphocyte count &gt; 800/mcL Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Hemoglobin &gt; 10.0 g/dL Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.0 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.0 x institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must negative pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent HCG ) entry onto trial within 7 day prior start study medication , effect NeoVax develop human fetus unknown . It investigators ' responsibility repeat pregnancy test start treatment delay . Female patient enrol study , free menses &gt; 2 year , post hysterectomy / oophorectomy , surgically sterilize , must willing use either 2 adequate barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method contraception prevent pregnancy abstain sexual activity throughout study , start visit 1 4 week last dose study therapy . Approved contraceptive method include example ; intra uterine device , diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap spermicide , male condom , female condom spermicide . Spermicides alone acceptable method contraception . Male patient must agree use adequate method contraception start first dose NeoVax 4 week last dose study therapy . Prior treatment immunemodulatory agent include , limited : IL2 , CTLA4 blockade , PD1/PDL1 blockade , CD40 stimulation , CD137 stimulation exception INFα give adjuvant treatment highrisk , surgically resect melanoma Prior investigational melanomadirected cancer vaccine therapy Prior chemotherapy , include target therapy BRAF MEK inhibition Treatment investigational product within last 2 month prior entry study Previous bone marrow stem cell transplant Concomitant therapy anticancer agent , investigational anticancer therapy , immunosuppressive agent ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid Use nononcology vaccine therapy prevention infectious disease ( upto ) 4 week prior enrollment study . Patients may receive nononcology vaccine therapy period NeoVax administration least 8 week last dose study therapy History severe allergic reaction attribute vaccine therapy prevention infectious disease Mucosal melanoma uveal melanoma allow Active , know , suspect autoimmune disease immunosuppressive condition exception vitiligo , type 1 diabetes , residual autoimmunerelated hypothyroidism require hormone replacement , psoriasis require systemic treatment . Concomitant treatment corticosteroid great physiologic dos ( used management cancer noncancerrelated illness ) . Topical ( include propose vaccination site ) inhalational steroid allow . Known chronic infection HIV , hepatitis B C Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia Any underlying medical condition , psychiatric condition social situation opinion investigator would compromise study administration per protocol compromise assessment AEs . Pregnant woman exclude study personalize neoantigen peptide polyICLC agent unknown risk develop fetus . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother personalize neoantigen peptide polyICLC , nurse woman exclude study . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : Individuals history malignancy eligible diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin</criteria>
