	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well stereotactic body radiotherapy ipilimumab work treat patient stage IV melanoma . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , target certain cell interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving SBRT ipilimumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Followed Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility immune-related clinical response associate SBRT give conjunction ipilimumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine late toxicity immune pharmacodynamic change SBRT follow ipilimumab . OUTLINE : Patients undergo total 3 fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy day 1-13 . Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 60 day , every effort make obtain record patient follow , permission seek investigator and/or study team re-contact patient directly regard health status toxicity .</detailed_description>
