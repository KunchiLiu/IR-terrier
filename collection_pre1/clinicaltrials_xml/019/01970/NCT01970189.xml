	<detailed_description>This observational disease registry database recently-diagnosed adult patient primary ITP aim understand natural history rare disease disease management . Participating investigator prospectively enter real-world patient data enrol patient minimum 2 year follow . Data registry use generate descriptive statistic demographic , clinical characteristic include prevalence incidence co-morbidities , treatment pattern , adverse outcome ( result treatment disease ) ITP patient annual basis . The information generate national combined-country level . Furthermore , institution access data may choose generate descriptive statistic specific institution frequent , ad-hoc basis . New research question question address subset registry patient take advantage combine registry data require separate protocol review independent committees The focus protocol adult primary ITP , however , future may interest expand population explore secondary ITP patient well . Hence , registry build allow optional preliminary information relate secondary ITP capture . Multi-site participation registry project roll stage , offer centre appropriate expertise . Pilot country include Australia , Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , Malaysia , Japan , Thailand Turkey sit select base potential research ( interest , resource , expect patient volume ) . Additional site may add future country Asia Pacific , Middle East Latin America . Japan independent national ITP registry run government , however voluntary participation interested Japanese investigator database welcome , therefore allow comparison data Japanese non-Japanese patient .</detailed_description>
