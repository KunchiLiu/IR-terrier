	<brief_summary>Rare tumor understudy , yet potential shed light vast area cancer research . Ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor , rare tumor childhood young adulthood , recently find associated lung cancer early childhood call pleuropulmonary blastoma ( PPB ) . The cause ovarian tumor unknown . DICER1 mutation see majority child PPB . Research show DICER1 mutation also see patient ovarian tumor . Like PPB , ovarian stromal tumor highly curable find early stage ; however , later form disease aggressive often fatal . The International Ovarian Stromal Tumor Registry collect clinical biologic data understand tumor occur treat . Current work involve study role DICER1 miRNA expression ovarian stromal tumor . Understanding clinical history , predispose factor DICER1 miRNA expression ovarian tumor childhood lead target screen risk stratification evidence-based treatment biologically rational therapy . These effort improve live child increase survival reduce late effect . The specific goal International Ovarian Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry : 1. understand risk factor study age , pathologic subtype , histopathologic feature , tumor invasiveness , degree differentiation , presence metastasis 2. collect information personal family history order refine clinical characteristic patient family without germline DICER1 mutation genetic predispose factor 3. determine whether pattern gene expression DNA alteration correlate predisposition ovarian tumor , biologic behavior clinical outcome 4. determine optimal screen regimen 5. use clinical data obtain Registry refine treatment algorithms 6. establish collection annotated biology specimen ( tumor tissue germline DNA ) future research</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Registry collect analyzes case-by-case data ovarian stromal tumor . Cases identify : 1. referral clinician pathologist 2. family initiate contact Registry 3. Registry request author publish case share detail The data collect include : 1. clinical laboratory finding 2. family history 3. imaging study 4. surgery record 5. pathology record include review study pathology material 6. treatment ( surgery , chemotherapy , radiation ) 7. recurrence metastases 8. long-term follow-up The demographic clinical data abstract database secure password protection . Each record database unique Registry number . Enrollment OTST Registry base local diagnosis , central pathology review offer part Registry procedures . DICER1 test facilitate . For patient enrol , Registry request 1 ) whole blood DNA extraction lymphoblastoid cell line generation 2 ) slide snap frozen tumor tissue ( available ) , 3 ) paraffin block . In case , saliva sample , buccal swab urine sample obtain DNA extraction . Pathology material centrally review available . Any discrepancy diagnostic interpretation discuss submit pathologist clinician . When central review pathologist confirm diagnosis stromal tumor , refer physician notify . The local pathologist retain responsibility final pathological diagnosis . It responsibility refer physician notify patient regard discrepancy find . Participants interested DICER1 test arrange phlebotomy service physician . Biologic specimens bank stored future research .</detailed_description>
