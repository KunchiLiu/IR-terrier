	<brief_title>Sleep Apnea CRT Upgrading</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within last decade cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) proven effective therapy reduce morbidity mortality chronic heart failure patient wide QRS complex , particular complete leave bundle branch block . New indication recently establish , include patient mild symptom patient need conventional pace high-grade atrioventricular block . More half - 80 % - patient heart failure suffer concomitant sleep apnea ( SA ) , worsen symptoms prognosis . Cardiac resynchronization therapy may ameliorate sleep apnea , central form sleep apnea ( CSA ) . However , small uncontrolled study mainly less 20 patient report far concern interaction CRT sleep apnea , data available patient conventional right ventricular pace undergo upgrading CRT . Therefore , want perform study call UPGRADE characterize - first randomize study compare effect new-onset cardiac resynchronization therapy moderate severe central sleep apnea , define AHI ≥ 15/h assess polysomnography patient conventional right ventricular pace know decrease cardiac function , induce heart failure atrial fibrillation - use new technology call AP Scan® enable continuous reliable monitoring sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) ; technology validate polysomnography , gold standard diagnosis follow-up patient sleep apnea Unfortunately , one third patient still benefit CRT ( so-called non-responders ) . On hand , 20 % patient greatly benefit completely recover term normalization leave ventricular ejection fraction and/or functional capacity ( so-called super-responders ) . Research urgently need decrease number non-responders increase number super-responders . Patient selection still base QRS duration morphology . Echocardiography image technique mechanical dyssynchrony assessment fail useful predictor adequate patient selection . Therefore , want test whether CRT improve concomitant sleep apnea , also preexist sleep apnea predicts response CRT patient previously conventional right-ventricular pacing undergo upgrade CRT additional implantation leave ventricular lead .</detailed_description>
