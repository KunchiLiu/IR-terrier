Randomization Prior enrollment study , eligible participate patient randomize control remote prenatal care group . The study coordinator aware group participant assign provide training tailor assigned study group . The telemedicine group receive training describe . The control group receive train survey instrument instruction access message box within MyChart . 2 . Remote Monitoring Devices Remote prenatal care group participant measure , record , submit blood pressure , weight , fetal heart recording MyChart ( describe ) 48 hour prior schedule remote prenatal care visit ( describe ) . - Weight- Participants use home scale give one use n't one . For demonstration purpose , scale available in-person visit study coordinator . The patient require measure weight pound near pound . - Blood Pressure- Participants provide one digital blood pressure cuff measure blood pressure use throughout pregnancy . They require report systolic diastolic blood pressure measure displayed device millimetre mercury ( mmHg ) . - Fetal Heart Rate- Participants provide one digital fetal doppler monitor use throughout pregnancy . They use determine fetus ' heart rate beat per minute . Patients allow keep device conclusion study compensation participate complete research . 3 . MyChart Epic MyChart personal health record link Epic electronic health record use University Utah . Participants use MyChart record information allow recording integrate within Epic electronic health record viewable treat clinician . At time point require patient record health data describe , patient-entered flowsheets available require data field . Help text also available form assist proper data entry . Automated data validity checking assure data properly record . 4 . Remote Prenatal Care Visit The remote prenatal care visit conduct predetermine scheduled time use web-based , Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA-compliant video communication solution provide University Utah Department Telemedicine .

Survey Instrument The survey instrument , build use REDCap , available immediately follow schedule visit . A link survey available MyChart well email message box within MyChart . If survey n't complete within 72 hour , study coordinator contact participant remind complete survey . Participants one week complete survey . 6 . Sample Size/Statistical Analysis Plan Sample size base non-inferiority test . We assume control group 80 % satisfied . We allow relative 10 % worse-than non-inferiority margin , equate intervention group satisfaction percent 72 % . A sample size 100 per group use 80 % power two-sided 0.05 alpha comparison allow intervention group satisfaction 85 % . It reasonable expect give perceived advantage travel . We test superiority demonstrate non-inferiority . In step-wise method , multiple comparison adjustment need .</detailed_description>
