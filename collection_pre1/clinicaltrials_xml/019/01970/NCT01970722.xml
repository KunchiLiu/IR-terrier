	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study side effect well surgery heat chemotherapy without non-heated chemotherapy surgery work treat patient ovarian , fallopian tube , uterine , peritoneal cancer . Giving dose heat chemotherapy abdomen surgery do remove ovarian , fallopian tube , uterine , peritoneal cancer may help low risk cancer come back . Giving unheated chemotherapy drug directly abdomen surgery may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery Chemotherapy With Without Chemotherapy After Surgery Treating Patients With Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Uterine , Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether cytoreductive surgery hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) follow postoperative normothermic intraperitoneal ( IP ) chemotherapy feasible safe administer , measure toxicity occur treatment follow-up . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine quality life ( QoL ) compare outcomes historical control IP chemotherapy ( HIPEC ) woman ovarian cancer . II . To determine whether cytoreductive surgery HIPEC alone feasible safe administer , measure toxicity occur treatment follow-up . III . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . IV . To collect biospecimens perform correlative translational study focus understanding mechanisms action HIPEC ovarian cancer micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) profile ovarian cancer ex vivo evaluation oncolytic virus replication . OUTLINE : Patients undergo surgery receive hyperthermic cisplatin intraperitoneally ( IP ) 60 minute . Beginning least 3 week surgery , patient may receive carboplatin , paclitaxel , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride , gemcitabine hydrochloride IP intravenously ( IV ) discretion medical gynecologic oncologist . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-6 , 6-9 , 9-12 , 12-15 month ; every 3 month 1 year ; every 4 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
