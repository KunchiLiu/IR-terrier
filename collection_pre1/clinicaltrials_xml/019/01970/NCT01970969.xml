	<brief_summary>Our primary hypothesis risk score comprise approximately 10 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) associate atrial fibrillation Genome Wide Association Study ( GWAS ) level associate development atrial fibrillation among previously undiagnosed patient high risk atrial fibrillation . A current example SNPs show Table 1 . As secondary hypothesis , test association atrial fibrillation diagnose study subset SNPs report associated atrial fibrillation fine-mapping SNPs . We also test association atrial fibrillation less great 30 second panel approximately 10 SNPs .</brief_summary>
