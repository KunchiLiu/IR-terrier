The patient , provide informed consent , agree risk benefit state patient inform consent document . Peripheral lesion native SFA popliteal artery reference vessel diameter ≥ 4.0 ≤ 7.0 mm , lesion lengths ≥ 4 cm ≤ 27 cm angiographically document Diameter stenosis preprocedure must ≥ 70 % Target lesion SFA popliteal artery ( first two proximal segment ) * . * far applicable distance target lesion previously implant stent 1cm Vessels must adequate runoff least one vessel foot . Treatment max . two lesion permit . Patients Rutherford class 5 6 Women know suspected pregnant . Hence , patient advise use adequate birth control method include 6month followup . Patients expect life span le 24 month Patients bleed diathesis anticoagulation antiplatelet medication contraindicate Patients cerebral stroke &lt; 6 month prior procedure Patients unstable angina pectoris Patients acute myocardial infarction within past 2 week Patient participate clinical trial involve investigational device drug interfere effect study trial . Interventional treatment contralateral leg within 2 week prior study intervention Untreated hyperthyroidism Patient presence history severe renal failure ( GFR &lt; 30ml/min ) therefore eligible angiography .
