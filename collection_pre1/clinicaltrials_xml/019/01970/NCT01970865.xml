	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Evidence histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis metastatic NSCLC ( Stage IV , AJCC v7.0 ) carry ALK rearrangement , determine Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve FISH assay ( Abbott Molecular Inc ) Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) ( Ventana Inc ) , ROS1 rearrangement determine FISH RT PCR Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) via local diagnostic test ( LDT ) . All patient ( ALK positive ROS1 positive ) must archival tissue sample available collect prior enrollment . Disease Status Requirements : Phase 1 : ALKpositive NSCLC ROS1positive patient must either treatment naïve advance set disease progression least 1 previous ALK/ROS1 inhibitor therapy ( y ) . Phase 2 : ALKpositive NSCLC patient must either : Treatment naïve ( ie , prior chemotherapy metastatic disease set prior ALK inhibitor therapy allow ) . Disease progression crizotinib . No prior chemotherapy allow metastatic disease set . Disease progression crizotinib 1 2 prior regimen chemotherapy metastatic disease set . Disease progression 1 prior ALK inhibitor therapy crizotinib . Patients may number prior chemotherapy regimen disease set . Disease progression 2 prior ALK inhibitor therapy . Patients may number prior chemotherapy regimen disease set . Disease progression 3 prior ALK inhibitor therapy . Patients may number prior chemotherapy regimen disease set . ROS1positive NSCLC patient may : Treatment naïve ( ie , prior chemotherapy metastatic disease set prior ROS inhibitor therapy ) . Any number prior therapy ( ie , chemotherapy and/or ROS inhibitor therapy ) . Tumor Requirements : All Patients must least one measurable target extracranial lesion accord RECIST v1.1 . In addition patient asymptomatic CNS metastasis ( include patient asymptomatic mean stable decrease dos steroid within last 2 week prior study entry ) eligible . Patients leptomeningeal disease ( LM ) carcinomatous meningitis ( CM ) eligible . Adequate Bone Marrow , Pancreatic Function , Renal Function Liver Function . Negative Serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential Exclusion Criteria Radiation therapy ( except palliative relieve bone pain ) within 2 week study entry . Whole brain radiation must complete least 4 week prior study entry . Systemic anti cancer therapy complete within minimum 5 half life study entry . Prior therapy antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation immune checkpoint pathway , include , limited , antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , anticytotoxic T lymphocyte associate antigen 4 ( antiCTLA4 ) antibody . Active clinically significant bacterial , fungal , viral infection include hepatitis B ( HBV ) , hepatitis C ( HCV ) , know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness . Clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( , active &lt; 3 month prior enrollment ) : cerebral vascular accident/stroke , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Classification Class ≥ II ) , seconddegree thirddegree AV block ( unless pace ) AV block PR &gt; 220 msec . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation grade , bradycardia define &lt; 50 bpm ( unless patient otherwise healthy longdistance runner , etc . ) , machineread ECG QTc &gt; 470 msec , congenital long QT syndrome . History extensive , disseminate , bilateral presence Grade 3 4 interstitial fibrosis interstitial lung disease include history pneumonitis , hypersensitivity pneumonitis , interstitial pneumonia , interstitial lung disease , obliterative bronchiolitis pulmonary fibrosis . Current use anticipate need food drug know strong moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor , inducer substrate ; drug CYP2C9 substrates ; drug sensitive CYP2B6 substrate ; drug strong CYP2C19 inhibitor ; drug strong CYP2C8 inhibitor ; drug Pgp substrate .</criteria>
