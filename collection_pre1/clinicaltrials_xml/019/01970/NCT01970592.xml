	<detailed_description>A primary impairment associate post-stroke hemiparesis failure make rapid grade adjustment muscle force ( i.e . muscle power ) within context purposeful complex synergy ( e.g. , coordination walking ) . Not surprisingly , impact stroke walk significant , less 50 % survivor progress independent community ambulation . Even among achieve independent ambulation , significant residual deficit persist balance gait speed , ~75 % person post-stroke reporting limitation mobility relate walking . Muscle weakness prominent motor consequence among nearly 6 million survivor stroke live United States strong predictor functional disability large clinical cohort . To date , physiological mechanism contribute muscle dysfunction hemiparetic subject largely unstudied . Moreover , evidence regard efficacy intervention aim attenuate impaired muscle function ensue functional consequence post-stroke population equivocal viable therapeutic option remediate hemiparetic muscle weakness remain among press challenge biomedical research . The investigator propose impaired muscle power ( product muscle strength velocity ) generation causal functional ( walk ) disability post-stroke . In addition , coordination deficit also critical determinant functional performance . The investigator develop comprehensive theoretical framework defines measure factor underlie disordered muscle function coordination apply framework Post-stroke Optimization Walking use Explosive Resistance ( POWER ) training . The investigator ' goal four year funding period 1 ) quantify neural muscular adaptation contribute impaired muscle power generation post-stroke ; 2 ) ass effect POWER train neural muscular adaptation paretic non-paretic muscle ; 3 ) determine relationship change neural muscular adaptation follow POWER train locomotor improvement . Innovative aspect propose work include novel training intervention ; advanced magnetic resonance assessment ; well unique measure coordination investigator propose . It investigators ' belief : ) neural muscular adaptation follow stroke associate impaired muscle power generation well locomotor ability , b ) POWER training attenuate functional deficit address underlying neural muscular element c ) functional improvement follow training predicate improve prominent neural muscular contributor muscle power generation . If correct , data generate provide entirely new level evidence regard effectiveness novel intervention strategy improve functional performance well importance peripheral muscle property predictor locomotor ability post-stroke .</detailed_description>
