	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine teriflunomide safe effective prevent relapse patient relapse type MS switch natalizumab teriflunomide patient risk PML . This two center interventional study patient 12 continuous infusion natalizumab , anti-JCV-ab positive , free clinical relapse prior 12 month natalizumab therapy switch teriflunomide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Switching Relapsing MS Patients Treated With Natalizumab Risk PML Teriflunomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Teriflunomide primary metabolite leflunomide , market worldwide treatment rheumatoid arthritis . Teriflunomide inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) , forth enzyme de novo synthesis pathway pyrimidines.Activated T-lymphocytes utilize de novo pyrimidine salvage pathway pyrimidine ribonucleotide synthesis.After mitogen stimulation , teriflunomide inhibits vitro T cell proliferation , DNA RNA synthesis expression cell surface nuclear antigens directly involve T-cell activation proliferation . Natalizumab ( NTZ ) FDA approve treatment relapsing-forms multiple sclerosis ( MS ) pivotal study show annualized relapse-rate ( ARR ) reduction 68 % , reduction new gadolinium ( Gd+ ) lesions 92 % reduction disability 42 % compare placebo.NTZ highly effective control MS risk develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) increase duration use natalizumab . It serious life threaten complication 1 500 1 250 patient 18 infusion due PML detect antibody ( Ab ) JC virus . The risk PML much great patient prior immunosuppressive ( IS ) treatment . The combination detect anti-JCV Ab , duration NTZ treatment great 24 month prior IS increase risk development PML incidence 11 per 1000 treat patient . So need alternative MS disease modify treatment ( DMT ) use patient risk develop PML NTZ treatment might sufficiently effective MS patient ' MS worsen lower eliminate risk PML .</detailed_description>
