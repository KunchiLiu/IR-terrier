	<brief_summary>Approximately two third adult population develop country categorize over-weight obese ( BMI &gt; 30 ) . In spite worldwide increase awareness , obesity major health concern . In presence numerous diet , medical therapy , robust research , bariatric surgery remain effective mean weight reduction morbidly obese patient ( BMI &gt; 40 , BMI &gt; 35 co-morbidities ) . However , bariatric surgery harbor relatively high risk postoperative complication ; , venous thromboembolic event ( VTE ) common , potentially lethal . Taken together propensity morbidly obese patient develop VTE , perioperative thromboprophylaxis mandatory . To date , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) commonly use VTE prophylaxis aforementioned population . Due pharmacologic property LMWH characteristic surgically treat obese patient , optimal dose utilized VTE prophylaxis population remain unclear . Assessment anti-FXa level patient ' plasma use order monitor LMWH activity . Levels 0.2-0.5 U/ml propose author VTE prophylaxis . Few study compare different dose regimen enoxaparin ( 30mg-60mg q/12h ) VTE prophylaxis population undergo bariatric surgery ; nevertheless , small non- randomize trial , contain numerous methodological weakness . Hence , optimal regimen enoxaparin use prevention VTE discuss population remain unclear . The aim present study evaluate plasma level anti-FXa activity , compare two commonly use enoxaparin prophylactic regimen ( 40mg vs 60mg q/24h ) large homogenous cohort sleeve gastrectomy patient . Although universally use bariatric surgeon , pharmacologic efficacy regimen evaluate patient undergo bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti Xa Levels Under Two Different Regimens Enoxaparin VTE Prophylaxis After Sleeve Gastrectomy Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following step shall perform process recruit patient study : Preoperatively : - A baseline blood sample Anti-FXa level shall obtain . - Randomization patient one two treatment group Postoperatively : - All patient treat Sequential Compression Devices , massive I.V hydration encourage ambulate early . - Patients receive three injection enoxaparin , accord treatment group assign , The first injection give morning surgery . Four hour third injection enoxaparin blood sample take patient assess anti-FXa level . A control group 5 patient , randomly elect , recruit . This group treat enoxaparin . These patient treat sequential compression device massive I.V hydration , accept treatment , proven effective study population . The goal assess anti-FXa level patient , represent baseline level patient undergo laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy . Furthermore , preoperative , operative postoperative management patient identical treatment group third day post-operation blood sample patient retrieve assessed anti-FXa level .</detailed_description>
