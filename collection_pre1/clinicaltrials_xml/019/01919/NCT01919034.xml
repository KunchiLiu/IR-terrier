	<brief_summary>According basic finding , important confirm result clinic . In branch , investigator use patient control analgesic ( PCA ) device investigate consumption morphine patient undergoing hepatic surgery . Preoperative postoperative ( surgery ) blood sampling ( 15cc/time ) liver tissue ( 10mm3 ) harvest measure expression molecule ( TM , IL-20 , HD ) . Pain questionnaire also apply evaluate pain control quality . Certainly , morphine consumption result pain questionnaire correlate molecule amount figure possible relationship morphine consumption molecule . Patients undergo abdominal surgery use morphine pain control analgesia ( PCA ) device involve . Pre- Post- operative ( anesthesia end surgery ) blood sampling ( total 30 ml ) plus normal liver tissue ( 10mm3 ) e harvest . Above protein ( TM , IL-20 , HD ) amount change measure ( ELISA TM , IL-20 ( serum ) flowcytometry ( white cell ) TM , HD , IL-20 expression , stain blot skin tissue ) . Patients include branch check correlation morphine consumption protein expression . Pain questionnaire ( BPI , McGill ) apply pain evaluation . 2-D gel analysis also apply screen possible molecule . Specific aim 1 . To investigate correlation morphine consumption serum amount IL-20 , TM HD 2 . To investigate relationship IL-20 , TM , HD amount liver tissue morphine consumption</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As investigator know , pain , ancient enemy human kind , one mystical phenomenon within body . For century , people search magic wand solve issue reach heaven destination . However , like original sin commit Adam Eve , shadow pain always surround even rebel body spirit . Even , pain trap soul body acute stage induce noxious stimulation also change mind body whenever chronic period start even stimulation disappears . Pain far become one great health issue modern people . It affect million people treatment option quite limited effective everyone . Drugs pain relief quite kind associated lot side effect . On way , people develop chronic pain , especially painful stimulation , remain investigated . The integrated project , combine preliminary study novel finding university ( TM , IL-20 , HD ) , set platform pain drug discovery possible pathway pain mechanism also provide important clinical data patient severe pain major surgery . Four sub-projects include integrated project : 1 . IL-20 important analgesia pain mechanism . 2. potential thrombomodulin analgesic . 3 . Huntington mouse produce less pain behavior . 4 . The relationship morphine consumption TM , IL-20 HD protein post-operative patient . 1.Interleukin-20 ( IL-20 ) proinflammatory cytokine belong IL-10 family . IL-20 produce activate keratinocytes monocytes transmits intracellular signal two distinct cell-surface receptor complex keratinocytes epithelial cell . IL-20 regulates proliferation differentiation keratinocytes inflammation , particularly inflammation associate skin . It also involve pathogenesis osteoporosis new target treat disease . However , little data demonstrate role pain . Meanwhile , IL-10 involve many pain model suppress IL-10 expression also reduce pain animal model . In sub-project , Our preliminary data demonstrate increase IL-20 morphine administration . Therefore , investigator explore role IL-20 pain management . 2 . ) Thrombomodulin ( TM ) transmembranous glycoprotein , thrombin mediate formation active protein C ( APC ) involve proinflammatory procoagulant process . Thrombomodulin- thrombin complex activate protein C inhibit coagulation cascade . Lectin-like domain ( D1 ) TM prevent neutrophil monocyte adhesion inhibit inflammation process . In addition , TM bind HMGB1 ( high-mobility group box 1 ) prevent leukocyte activation demonstrate previous study . HMGB1 appear role neuropathic pain involve dorsal root ganglion peripheral nerve injury recent investigation develop many therapy aim HMGB1 include antibody recent day . HMGB1 interact RAGE relate induce hyperalgesia rodent model neuropathic pain pain hypersensitivity peripheral nerve injury . In branch study , investigator use various pain model evaluate expression TM tissue . 3.Huntington disease ( HD ) neurodegenerative genetic disorder affect muscle coordination . It cause autosomal dominant mutation Huntingtin gene accumulate Huntington protein . This protein play important role nerve cell . It upregulates Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) essential development . It associate vesicle microtubule involve vesicle traffic . It also interact 100 protein . However , less investigation focus protein pain sensory level . Under cooperation Dr. Yang , investigator investigate over-expression Huntington protein mouse induce Huntington disease . The investigator work issue deepen find produce new view old disease . 4.According basic finding , important confirm result clinic . In branch , investigator use patient control analgesic ( PCA ) device investigate consumption morphine patient undergoing hepatic surgery . Preoperative postoperative blood sample tinny liver tissue ( 10mm3 ) harvest correlate morphine consumption pain questionnaire evaluate pain control quality . Certainly , morphine consumption correlate molecule amount figure possible relationship morphine consumption molecule .</detailed_description>
