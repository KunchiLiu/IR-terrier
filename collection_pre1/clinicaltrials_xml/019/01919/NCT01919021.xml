	<brief_summary>Dyspeptic symptom , pain eating , bloat nausea major impact quality life health care cost . When structural cause identify , patient diagnose functional dyspepsia . This trial aim identify objective abnormality stomach function explain patient 's symptom establish diagnosis . Another group diabetic patient often develop similar symptom , label diabetic gastroparesis . In case associate delayed gastric empty . 24 patient functional dyspepsia study 24 healthy control ( establish normal range ) 24 diabetic patient symptoms functional dyspepsia . The utility 3 different non-invasive investigation assess . At screen nutrient drink test ( NDT ) ask patient drink 40ml milkshake ( 0.75kcal/ml ) every minute score symptom every 5 minute . The patient continue reach maximum tolerated volume . Participants randomize undergo non-invasive image two separate test day magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) gastric scintigraphy MRI complete patient ingest 400ml milkshake ( identical NDT ) 12 agar bead ( additional calorie ) know break strength . The empty stomach visualise MRI alongside symptom record . Gamma scintigraphy ingest meal MRI scan radioactive label allow rate liquid solid meal empty visualised alongside symptom record . Additionally , blood sugar record nutrient drink test 15 30 minute follow ingestion 400ml milkshake 12 agar bead . Data analyze assess association objective abnormality gastric function patient symptom . Additionally result non-invasive imaging MRI GS compare ass optimal measurement gastric function empty clinical scenario .</brief_summary>
