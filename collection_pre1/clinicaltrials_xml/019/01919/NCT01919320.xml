	<brief_summary>Study Purpose The purpose PAS confirm patient implant temporary Total Artificial Heart ( TAH-t ) support Companion 2 Driver System outcomes similar patient implant TAH-t support CSS Console . The data collection mechanism study INTERMACS Registry . Study Objectives Primary Objective 1 : To confirm patient implanted TAH-t support Companion 2 Driver System outcomes similar patient implant TAH-t support CSS Console . Primary Objective 2 : To compare positive outcome rate TAH-t patient enter Intermacs Registry initially support Companion 2 Driver System positive outcome rate TAH-t patient initially support CSS Console . Primary Objective 3 : To review additional data ( patient survival , adverse event rate bridge transplant rate ) support conclusion use artificial heart reasonable necessary treatment irreversible biventricular failure Medicare/Medicaid patient . Secondary Objective : - To evaluate incidence adverse event ( AEs ) . The AEs follow definition INTERMACS Registry . Study Hypothesis : Primary Objective 1 The primary hypothesis positive outcome rate ( define transplant , transfer Freedom Driver System support , continue implant driver support , whichever occur first ; assess three six month post-implant ) patient support Companion 2 Driver System non-inferior survival rate patient support Circulatory Support System ( CSS ) Console . Data Collection The data collect defined INTERMACS Protocol patient follow one week , one month , three month six month study endpoint reach . Data Analysis Primary Objective 1 : Data analysis provide descriptive statistic enrollment , adverse event , outcomes TAH-t patient implant supported Companion 2 Driver System compare TAH-t patient implant supported CSS Console . Primary Objective 2 : Data analysis provide descriptive statistic enrollment , adverse event , outcomes TAH-t patient enrol INTERMACS Registry .</brief_summary>
