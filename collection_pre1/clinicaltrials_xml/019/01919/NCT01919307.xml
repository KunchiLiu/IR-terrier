	<brief_title>Auricular Acupuncture For The Treatment Of Non-Epileptic Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Formerly refer `` psychogenic '' `` pseudo '' seizure , Non-Epileptic Seizures ( NES ) physical manifestation psychological disturbance type Somatoform Disorder call conversion disorder . NES significant neurological condition occur prevalence 2 33 per 100,000 , similar Multiple Sclerosis . Patients suffer phenomenon exhibit seizure-like behavior without electrophysiological correlate , would expect , anti-epileptic drug ( AED ) effective treat disorder . These patient large consumer health care resource , frequently unemployed , require public assistance safety-net program , difficult properly diagnose without aid Epilepsy Monitoring Units ( EMU ) . Furthermore , even proper diagnosis EMU , consensus standard care therapy form conversion disorder . Most frequently patient refer mental health therapy ( Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ) frequently pursue patient due poor access , poor insight , stigma . In survey refractory epilepsy clinic , 68 % respondent use form CAM Complementary Alternative Medicine , compare 39 % Midwestern population . CAM may offer solution access interest-in-therapy population patient experience high frequency debilitate event , include NES . As complementary alternative medicine , acupuncture felt safe cost-effective therapeutic approach treatment many disease symptom . While effect acupuncture treatment epilepsy equivocal , study set mental health disorder post-traumatic stress disorder anxiety promising . Auricular acupuncture specifically study cocaine dependence , smoke cessation , dental anxiety , PTSD . Our interest acupuncture NES result study show evidence acupuncture may improve conversion disorder present psychogenic movement disorder , psychogenic erectile dysfunction ( 16 ) . There also appear measurable change parasympathetic sympathetic balance attributable acupoint stimulation , may explain anecdotal report stress seizure reduction acupuncture . It also note Vagus Nerve Stimulator , implantable device control medically refractory epileptic seizure , presumably modulate parasympathetic tone , first approve adjunctive therapy pharmacologically resistant epilepsy FDA 1997 later approve treatment-resistent depression 2005 . Based literature conduct un-blinded treatment trial establish auricular acupuncture effect seizure frequency NES , help design large double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial determine efficacy auricular acupuncture treatment NES . In addition potentially uncovering effective treatment NES , research add empiric knowledge acupuncture conversion disorder NES stimulate research acupuncture NES , understudied area .</detailed_description>
