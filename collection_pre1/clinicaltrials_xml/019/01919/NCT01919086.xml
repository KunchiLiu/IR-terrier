	<brief_summary>The purpose study see researcher could get good result less toxicity use new approach . We already know three drug bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone give together time effective . Most physician therefore treat patient multiple myeloma 3 drug combination . However , researcher also know three drug give together result side effect 2 drug ( bortezomib dexamethasone lenalidomide dexamethasone ) give . The researcher believe patient may necessarily need three drug good result . In study , researcher first treat disease bortezomib dexamethasone . If disease well control 2 drug , third drug , lenalidomide , add . By use sequential approach may reach good result few side effect .</brief_summary>
