	<brief_title>Acute Non-mechanical Lower Digestive Tract Disorders Should Distinguish Whether Colonic Lesions Not Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study approve ethic committee Jinling hospital medical school nanjing university . This prospective study perform surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ) , contain 39 bed , general surgical departement Jinling hospital , affiliate hospital medical school nanjing university . Written inform consent obtain patient next kin . Critical patient age 18 80 year old diagnose acute lower gastrointestinal dysfunction recrutied study . The two follow criterias meet diagnosis acute lower gastrointestinal dysfunction : 1. enteral nutrition intolerance due upper gastriointestinal obstruction ; 2 . Colonic distension : colonic diameter &gt; 6 cm ileocecus diameter &gt; 9 cm view compute tomography abdomial X ray . Enteral nutrition intolerance define enteral feeding &lt; 50 % caculated need feed three day . Patients follow condition exclude : mechanical intestinal obstruction ( include tomor , stercoral obstruction etc ) ; gastrointestinal hemorrhage within 72 hour ; history inflammatory bowel disease ( ulcerative colitis crohn 's disease ) radiation enteritis ; pregnancy ; contradiction proserine administration . Data demagraphy , diagnosis , treatment well APACHE â…¡ SOFA score within 24 hs admission record . The included patient examine contrast-enhanced abdominal CT , devided two group , colon orient group non-colon orient group , independently 2 professional combine history CT result . Non-colon orient group meet one two follow crieria : 1. history nerve damage affect colon movement ( colon ( -innervating ) nerve damage ) ( pevic retroperitoneal operation , spine injury , cerebral lesion ) , non- mild edema colonic wall present abdominal CT ; 2. without history colon ( -innervating ) nerve damage , whereas obvious change see CT scan . The others clarify colon-oriented group ( namely , history colon ( -innervating ) nerve damage , moderate severe edema ; without history colon ( -innervating ) nerve damage , whereas mild sever edema present ) . All patient diagnose acute low gastrointestinal dysfunction treat accord protocol depict figure 1 . Conservative treatment : firstly , hydro-electrolyte thyroid function assess , correct abnormal . Maintain blood glucose normal level . Patients proning diagnosed sepsis adminstered antibiotic empirically , adjust target antibiotic accord ensue result blood culture drug sensitive test . Patients subject fasting , gastrointestinal decompression via stomach anal tube . Gastric residual volume ( GRV ) assess per diem . Pharmaceuticals impact bowel movement suspend far possible , opiate , anticholinergic drug , calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) . Intravenous administration proserine consider cecum diameter &gt; 10 cm treatement describe show sign ameliaration 24 h. Colonoscopic decompression : colonoscopic decompression apply obvious cecum distension exist ( diameter &gt; 10 ) 3 day , sign improvement gain 24-48 hs conservative treatment contradiction proserine exist . Colonoscopic decompression perform 2 experienced endoscopic physician bedside endoscope room . Surgical intervention : surgery indicate colonic diatension last 6 day , obvious cecal distention ( diameter &gt; 10 cm ) continue 48-72 h conservative management colonoscopic decompression ? ? ? contradiction colonoscopy . ileostomy perform epidural local anesthesia team experience surgeon . If patient colonic necrosis perforation , ileostomy supersede colectomy general anesthesia . In SICU , bladder pressure measure everaday reflect intraabdominal pressure . And patient receive CT examination day 1 , day 3 , day 5 every eusing week , additional illness-required CT . The measurement colonic cecum diameter , assessment intestional eddema , ischemia perforation perform two trained fellow record recovery time . Criteria colonic recovery follow : 1.enteral nutrition reach surpass 50 % target need 3 day ; 2 . Restoration normal aerofluxus defecation ; 3 . Significant improvent colonic distension colonic wall show abdominal CT ( colonic diameter &lt; 6 cm cecum diameter &lt; 9 cm ) . Recurrence define , patient rediagnosed acute low gastrointestional dysfunction within 72 hrs recovery certain treatment ( ) .</detailed_description>
