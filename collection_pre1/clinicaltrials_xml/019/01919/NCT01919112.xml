	<brief_summary>Swallowing difficulty common stroke lead serious complication like pneumonia malnutrition . Unfortunately , effective treatment improve swallow stroke patient . Previous investigation show recovery swallow function occur reorganization ( `` rewire '' ) non-involved cerebral hemisphere . In study , propose investigate new intervention , combine , swallow exercise brain stimulation target non-involved cerebral hemisphere , use low intensity current acute . We enrol hospitalize stroke patient . We plan assess safety technique patient population also assess effect improve swallow function swallow physiology . During time trial participant undergo standardize swallow neurological assessment well brain MRI scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Swallowing impairment common serious complication stroke lack effective therapy . We herein propose conduct prospective clinical study use non-invasive brain stimulation technique , anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , combination swallow exercise improve dysphagia due acute-subacute hemispheric infarction , obtain data safety effect 2 different dos tDCS , swallow physiology behavior . Dysphagia hemispheric stroke occurs due disruption cortical projection brainstem swallow center recovery swallow function show mediated via reorganization swallow cortex unaffected hemisphere . Our recent pilot study demonstrate application 5 consecutive daily session anodal tDCS 30 minute swallow cortex unaffected hemisphere safe feasible acute-subacute stroke phase show promise improve dysphagia , combine swallowing exercise . The propose research use confirm safety technique early stroke phase explore alternative , effective dos promote swallow recovery prior examination confirmatory trial . We use study cohort examine important subject specific parameter influence response propose intervention dysphagic stroke patient . The overall aim study gather additional safety data cumulative session tDCS acute-subacute phase stroke , obtain information effect intervention important physiological clinically relevant swallowing parameter , examine possible dose effect , identify candidate likely benefit intervention . The experience gain project guide planning future confirmatory trial use relevant clinical outcome assess potential benefit intervention utilize important subject specific parameter refine study inclusion criterion aid severity adjust analysis .</detailed_description>
