	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , sequential , ascend , single oral dose study conduct 2 part . Part 1 consist evaluation LGD-6972 healthy subject ( 6 group 8 subject ) , follow Part 2 , evaluation LGD-6972 subject T2DM ( 1 group 8 subject ) . There Screening Period 30 day . Subjects qualify Group G ( T2DM ) discontinue anti-diabetic medication Day -9 ( 1 week prior confinement ) group . Subjects Groups A , B , C , D , E F admit study site Day -1 , Group G admit study site Day -2 . Groups 8 subject randomize double-blind manner receive either LGD-6972 placebo ( 6 active:2 placebo ) single dose . Group D receive treatment fast fed condition separate washout period least 14 day 21 day . Each subject administer specify dose LGD-6972 placebo fast condition ( fed condition Group D evaluate effect food LGD-6972 PK profile ) observe morning Day 3 ( 48 hour post dose assessment ) . Safety assessment , LGD-6972 PK sample collection , PD assessments occur time . Subjects discharge study site 48 hour assessment return study site Day 7 follow evaluation . After follow evaluation subject evaluation safety tolerability data , available PK data , dose next group subject determine Safety Monitoring Panel ( SMP ) .</detailed_description>
