	<brief_summary>Background : - The National Institutes Health ( NIH ) perform 100 allogenic stem cell transplant ( allo-HSCT ) year . Many study already look different problem follow transplant . But many type transplant , disease , response , treatment . An organize study information could help researcher learn often transplant complication occur problem cause . It could also lead idea future research . This study focus complication think significant . Objectives : - To gather information complication may occur allo-HSCT . Eligibility : - People 2 year age currently enrol allo-HSCT study NIH . Design : - Visits study schedule along primary study visit . The number visit depend primary study schedule . - At visit , participant answer question take physical exam . - The question physical exam continue long primary study . - In visit , researcher might call participant discuss health . They may also discuss case primary study doctor doctor . Primary transplant study doctor make treatment decision . - When participation primary transplant study end , participation study also end .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Between 80 100 allogeneic stem cell transplant ( allo-HSCT ) perform every year NIH treat variety malignant nonmalignant condition . The current transplant protocol NIH focus research regard response underlie disease , development graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) well feasibility safety variety transplant strategy . Many clinically significant complication consider part transplant process study systematically . Even study , diverse institute-based protocol differ range complication capture amount information collect . This lead knowledge gap regard incidence risk factor complications various protocol . This exploratory natural history study involve prospective review medical record patient actively enrol allo-HSCT protocol NIH . The study focus infection subset noninfectious complication identify transplant community significant cause morbidity , mortality cost . The cost data capture study cost consume Clinical Center . This study require sample collection consist merely data collection optional periodic patient examination perform conjunction already schedule original transplant protocol . The prospective collection clinical data information available medical record allow u determine rate number complication different protocol . At completion study , expect investigator able generate preliminary hypothesis regard risk factor infection noninfectious complication , impact complication transplant cost correlation laboratory immune reconstitution ( usually determine transplant protocol variety way functional immune reconstitution ( frequency infection ) .</detailed_description>
