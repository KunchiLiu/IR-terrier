	<brief_title>Blinded Safety &amp; Efficacy Placebo Controlled Study Icatibant Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Induced Angioedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACE-Is ) class medication prescribe frequently treatment hypertension . They also use post myocardial infarction well patient heart failure , diabetes mellitus , chronic kidney disease . Approximately 35 40 million patient ACE-Is worldwide . Study HGT-FIR-096 multicenter , Phase III , randomize , double-blind , two-armed , placebo-controlled trial . The study population consist 118 adult patient , 18 year age old , present acute ACE-I-induced angioedema attack . The primary aim study demonstrate icatibant significantly effective placebo resolve attack angioedema cause ACE-I base Time Meeting Discharge Criteria ( TMDC ) . Safety tolerability , well pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , icatibant also evaluate . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive single sub-cutaneous injection either 30 mg icatibant placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female , 18 year age old . 2 . Patient currently treat ACE inhibitor . 3 . Patient present ACE inhibitorinduced angioedema attack head and/or neck region within 12 hour onset ( must sufficiently less 12 hour allow study drug give 12 hour attack onset ) . 4 . Angioedema must consider least moderate severity least one four angioedemaassociated airway symptom ( difficulty breathing , difficulty swallowing , voice change , tongue swell ) . 5 . Patient must voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committeeapproved inform consent form relevant aspect study explain discussed patient . 6 . Females must negative urine pregnancy test prior administration study medication , exception female total hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , 2 year postmenopausal . 1 . Patient diagnosis angioedema etiology ( eg , hereditary acquire angioedema , allergic angioedema [ eg , food , insect bite sting , evident clinical response antihistamine and/or corticosteroid ] , anaphylaxis , trauma , abscess infection associate disease , local inflammation , local tumor , postoperative postradiogenic edema , salivary gland disorder , [ nonACE inhibitor ] druginduced angioedema ) . 2 . Patients family history recurrent angioedema . 3 . Patients previous episode ( ) angioedema ACE inhibitor therapy . 4 . Patients acute urticaria ( itchy , erythematous wheal ) . 5 . Patients intervention support airway ( eg , intubation , tracheotomy , cricothyrotomy ) due current attack angioedema . 6 . Patient follow vascular condition , judgment investigator , would contraindication participation study .
