	<brief_summary>The central venous catheterization ( central line placement ) common procedure perform intensive care unit . This procedure perform percutaneous puncture call 'the central vein ' advancement catheter guidewire ( Seldinger technique ) . The tip catheter leave superior vena cava vicinity right atrium heart . Central vein large vein human body pass blood heart . Typical , clinical indication central line placement intensive care unit hemodynamic monitoring , volume monitoring , administration medication , long-term total parenteral nutrition , access renal replacement therapy , difficult peripheral catheterization . There two method central venous catheterization term visualization . First old blind technique . The operator locate anatomical landmark perform entire procedure blindly percutaneous puncture . This call landmark technique . Second new ultrasound-guided technique . The operator locate vein use ultrasonography perform entire procedure ultrasonographic visualization . The real time ultrasound-guided central venous catheterization become standard care recent year mainly safety issue ( regard safer landmark technique ) The catheterization axillary vein popular procedure daily clinical practice . But reasonable safe alternative others , typically performed central venous catheterization like internal jugular vein subclavian vein catheterization . The main intention study ass usefulness safety real time ultrasound guide axillary vein catheterization mechanically ventilate patient admit intensive care unit .</brief_summary>
