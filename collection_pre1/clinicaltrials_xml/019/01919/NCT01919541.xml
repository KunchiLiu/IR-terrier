	<detailed_description>Intervention Physical exercise program At baseline assessment patient ' physical fitness evaluate kinesiologist ( exercise specialist ) . The exercise component consist approximately 60 min resistance aerobic training , minimum 3 day per week . The exercise program individualize base upon baseline fitness test ( accord American College Sport Medicine , ACMS , standard ) 50 include : 5 min warm-up , either 25 min aerobic exercise ( start 30- 40 % heart rate reserve , HRR ) , 25 min resistance training ( 8 exercise target major muscle group perform moderate intensity ) , 5-10 min cool-down stretching period . All exercise clearly explain demonstrated kinesiologist baseline . Patients ask carry program home , unsupervised , monitored weekly telephone call . Training intensity progression occur participant complete aerobic exercise mild exertion and/or participant complete 15 repetition give resistance exercise . Participants provide resistance band exercise mat , well pedometer heart rate monitor , use participant monitor progress kinesiologist monitor daily compliance . A log book also complete report activity frequency exercise complete . The kinesiologist follow ( telephone call ) participant weekly basis ensure program compliance address barrier may prevent ongoing participation . Nutritional counsel The patient ' nutritional status adequacy dietary intake assess nutritionist use three day food record , biological index ( e.g . glycated hemoglobin ) , clinical history , Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment tool51 . Anthropometric measure , include percentage lean body mass fat , measure bioelectrical impedance skin caliper . Nutritional care plan focus meet daily protein requirement ( 1.2g/kg ) , management cancer-related symptom ( diarrhea , constipation ) , blood glucose control , optimization body composition ( i.e . weight loss/gain necessary ) nutrient intake provide practical suggestion , base actual intake , improve macronutrient distribution protein , fat , carbohydrate . The type dietary protein ( amino acid composition ) , digestibility , amount , time intake , co-ingestion macronutrients use capitalize post-exercise induced muscle protein synthesis52 . Twenty ( 20 ) gram protein , liquid form , take immediately resistance exercise regard sufficient maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis healthy individuals52 . Whey protein , particular , regard especially effective ingested exercise54 rapidly digest contains indispensable amino acid include leucine , believe independently stimulate translation initiation protein synthesis skeletal muscle52 . Post exercise co-ingestion carbohydrate appear provide anabolic effect , although improve protein balance blunt proteolysis maximally stimulating insulin secretion55 . The nutritionist provide patient post-workout nutrition prescription consist 20g whey protein52 1g/kg carbohydrates53 . Elderly patient require least 20g dose dietary protein resistance exercise approximately 30g dos , interval , within 24h `` window anabolic opportunity '' order simulate anabolic response 52.54,61 . Ingestion 1-1.5g carbohydrate/kg , within `` glycogen recovery window '' 15-30 minute exercise , replenish glycogen stores53 . To ensure compliance , patient ask complete daily log return empty sachet whey protein . Relaxation Strategies The kinesiologists instruct patient perform deep breathing exercise relaxation purpose . Patients instructed perform exercise daily need . Relaxation CD 's , include soothe sound , also give patient .</detailed_description>
