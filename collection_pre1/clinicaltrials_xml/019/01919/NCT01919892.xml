	<detailed_description>Mood disorder prevalent psychiatric , present chronic course high morbidity , affect 10-15 % population . Diverse structural , functional biochemical cerebral change describe pathophysiology mood disorder , special Bipolar Disorder ( BPD ) , associate impairment neuroprotective mechanism cellular resilience . However , clinical relevance pathophysiological finding rarely address . Meanwhile , lithium consider use mood stabilizer worldwide , show significant efficacy treatment manic depressive episode , well prevention suicide maintenance . Several study demonstrate significant neuroprotective neurotrophic effect induce lithium treatment diverse cellular molecular target , , know potential association cerebral effect therapeutic clinical efficacy induce proof concept agent . The present project aim investigate brain level lithium use magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 7Li-MRS ) association different marker neuronal viability n-acetyl-aspartate ( use 1-hydrogen-MRS ) , well peripheral marker mitochondrial , endoplasmic reticulum neurotrophic factor activity , highly implicated pathophysiology BD . The investigator work area last ten year , last three half Lab Molecular Pathophysiology Experimental Therapeutics , National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) , National Institutes Health . The candidate look forward establish appropriate structure develop `` Research Center Study Neuroplasticity Neuroprotection Psychiatric Disorders '' Institute Psychiatry , University Sao Paulo , Brazil . Overall , study neuroplasticity-mediated pathophysiological basis BPD implicate clinical presentation outcome may shed light development new , improved therapeutic devastate psychiatric disorder .</detailed_description>
