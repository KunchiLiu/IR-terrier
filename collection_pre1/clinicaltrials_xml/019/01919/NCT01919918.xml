	<brief_title>Muscle Afferent Feedback Effects Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial part limit exercise and/or physical activity human result development peripheral central fatigue physical activity . Peripheral fatigue comprise biochemical change within metabolic milieu work muscle lead attenuate response neural excitation , central fatigue comprise failure central nervous system drive motoneuron . Patients HF overactive group III/IV muscle afferent exaggerate development central fatigue physical activity explain reduced physical conditioning cardiac insufficiency cause failing heart . The exact mechanisms accounting exaggerated central fatigue HF remain elusive , however , development central fatigue exercise recently link signal group III/IV muscle afferent . This make heighten neural feedback HF likely candidate patient ' increase susceptibility central fatigue . Lower pH , increased lactate increase adenosine triphosphate show activate group III/IV afferents physiological manner thus induce , rest unfatigued muscle , intramuscular milieu associate moderate heavy exercise . The objective study quantitate compare sensitivity group III/IV afferent associated effect central fatigue HF patient healthy control skeletal muscle subject control low pH , increased lactate increase adenosine triphosphate .</detailed_description>
