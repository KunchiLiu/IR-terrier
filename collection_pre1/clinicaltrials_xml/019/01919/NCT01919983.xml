	<brief_summary>Despite pharmacologic advance treatment congestive heart failure ( HF ) , sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) pump failure remain leading cause mortality patient HF . Although , SCD poorly understand , implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) show effective , costly therapy prevent SCD . At present , leave ventricular systolic dysfunction best independent predictor SCD , moderately predict patient eventually benefit placement ICD , case , leave ventricular ( LV ) systolic dysfunction non-modifiable risk factor acquire . As result , exist intensive search biomarkers could improve prediction SCD potential risk factor modification . Experimental clinical evidence establish inflammation play critical role stable coronary disease , plaque rupture , acute myocardial infarction , heart failure , SCD . Studies institution demonstrate elevated level hsCRP Interleukin-6 predictive arrhythmic SCD ; however , mechanism cause increase risk unclear . Another well-known risk factor SCD abnormal sympathetic innervation . The robust clinical test sympathetic innervation date Iodine-123 Metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) image gamma scintigraphy . MIBG image emerge one strong predictor SCD detect sympathetic nervous system abnormalities patient HF . Preclinical clinical evidence suggest myocardial inflammation adversely affect myocardial innervation . Based finding , investigator hypothesize elevated level inflammatory biomarkers associate abnormal sympathetic innervation measure MIBG image . The investigator aim establish strength association . This proposal leverage unique access large , extensively phenotyped cohort patient undergone ICD implantation primary prevention SCD , PRospective Observational Study ICD SCD , ( PROSE-ICD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim follow : Primary Aim 1 : Determine inflammation associate abnormal cardiac sympathetic innervation patient enrol PROSE-ICD study . Rationale/Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize patient increase biomarkers systemic inflammation abnormal cardiac sympathetic innervation measure MIBG image . Specifically investigator : Image 100 patient PROSE-ICD cohort , 50 high lowest quartile hsCRP level determine whether patient biomarker evidence increase inflammation also abnormal sympathetic innervation . In addition , investigator pursue follow secondary aim : 1 . Determine inflammation , measure IL-6 , associate abnormal cardiac sympathetic innervation , measure MIBG imaging , patient enrol PROSE-ICD study . 2 . Examine association CRP MIBG ICD therapies PROSE-ICD . 3 . Compare several MIBG image metric sympathetic innervation , addition late H/M ratio , include early H/M ratio MIBG washout rate . 4 . Compare MIBG image ECG metric sympathetic innervation . 5 . Examine relationship inflammation regional myocardial innervation rest myocardial perfusion use quantitative qualitative SPECT imaging . Specifically , investigator aim determine inflammation associate perfusion/innervation mismatch .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Population This proposal enroll patient PROSEICD cohort undergone ICD implantation primary prevention SCD . PROSEICD multicenter prospective observational cohort study design identify risk factor SCD highrisk patient . Inclusion Criteria The entire PROSEICD population ischemic nonischemic cardiomyopathy divide quartile base previously measure hsCRP level PROSEICD database . The study sample study include 50 randomly select PROSEICD participant low hsCRP quartile another 50 randomly select participant high quartile . PROSEICD include patient great 18 year old history acute MI least 4 week old ( confirmed persistent pathologic Q wave ECG , CPKMB &gt; three time upper limit normal , fixed perfusion defect nuclear imaging ) nonischemic LV dysfunction least 9 month EF â‰¤ 35 % undergone implantation FDAapproved ICD primary prevention SCD within 2 week enrollment . Exclusion Criteria Exclusion criterion PROSEICD include indication ICD implantation secondary prevention ; inability unwillingness provide inform consent ; woman &lt; 50 year old anatomic childbearing potential unwilling use contraceptive ; NYHA class IV HF ; patient permanent pacemaker ; unsuccessful ICD implantation Additional exclusion criterion PROSEICD patient enrol MIBG image include : 1 . Positive pregnancy test woman child bear potential 2 . Use medication noncardiac condition may interfere MIBG safely withhold five halflives study procedure . 3 . Renal insufficiency ( GFR &lt; 30 ml/dl creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dl ) dialysis . 4 . Hypersensitivity iodine .</criteria>
