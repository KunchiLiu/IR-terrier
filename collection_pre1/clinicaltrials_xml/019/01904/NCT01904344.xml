	<brief_summary>The NXT_SLEEP study , bring together industry partner , research group ( home ) care provider , tackle develop next generation sleep-monitoring platform consist less obtrusive sensor , delivers complete useful information regard physiological parameter relevant sleep-related breathing disorder . These new innovative sensor need validated clinical setting benchmarked classical sleep monitoring system . In order compare novel sensor classical monitoring system , investigator use exist technology capture simultaneously acquire signal different physiological parameter relevant sleep-related breathing disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Validation New Breathing Sensors Patients With Respiratory Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep-related breathing disorder recognize major risk factor mortality due effect cardiovascular system . Currently , sleep disorder diagnose use polysomnography ( PSG ) , sleep test monitor different physiological signal heart rate , respiration , ECG , muscle tone eye movement . Although polysomnography important diagnostic tool sleep medicine , uncomfortable costly procedure , especially multiple night observation require . In order reduce cost improve patient comfort , different home monitoring system ( use different number type sensor ) introduce market , focus especially self-screening collect general sleep information . In addition increase comfort reducing cost , diagnostic capability PSG need enhance . This achieve add novel sensor may capture new information improve measurement vital physiological parameter sleep</detailed_description>
