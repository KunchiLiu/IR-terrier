	<brief_summary>This research project intend look effect certain type freeze injection , call paravertebral block , pain operation breast cancer , amount pain relief need side effect pain relief . The hypothesis paravertebral block , combination general anesthetic reduce pain score amount strong pain killer ( opioids ) need . This reduce side effect pain killer nausea vomit . This assess compare general anesthetic pain killer give intravenous ( IV ) routine practice . Patients require breast cancer surgery , agree involve trial , randomly allocate two group : group receive block , standardise optimise general anesthetic . In one group however block simply small injection skin ( sham block ) , whereas group receive proper paravertebral block prior . Both group receive opioids necessary , depend body reaction surgery pain score wake . The paravertebral block safe procedure low side effect profile , many study show benefit breast cancer surgery . The investigator would like assess practice . The block normally insert light sedation , freeze skin initially . It normally well tolerate . The sham block also perform light sedation freeze skin . The patient able tell whether sham block paravertebral block , well tolerate . There potential complication sham block .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Surgery breast cancer lead number issue perioperative period . Both acute chronic post-surgical pain commonly encounter problem , evidence degree acute pain influence likelihood chronic pain . Post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) also common , give predominantly female surgical population requirement opioid analgesia . Paravertebral block ( PVB ) effective mean provide analgesia mastectomy . A recent meta-analysis5 suggest considerable evidence paravertebral block without general anesthetic ( GA ) provide superior post-operative analgesia breast surgery operation do GA alone . There also reduce need rescue analgesia reduced opioid-related side effect . The result meta-analysis may influence publication bias , result difficult interpret lack standardisation technique ( single level injection , multi-level injection continuous blockade via catheter insert paravertebral space ) variety type dosage local anesthetic use PVB . The meta-analysis suggest PVB effective technique mastectomy minimal complication rate . In institution , common form analgesia mastectomy patient systemic opioid analgesia . However , last two year , single level PVBs use increase frequency reliable success . This due part use ultrasound-guidance placement PVB , relatively simple technique well-defined end-point . The investigator use 0.2 % ropivacaine , mention one study meta-analysis use multiple injection technique . The majority study use 0.5 % bupivacaine , study use PVB sole anesthetic technique . The next common local anesthetic use ropivacaine 0.5 % , frequently use multi-level injection . As investigator use single level injection combination GA , study completely relevant current practice . In study , investigator compare PVB use Ropivacaine 0.2 % combine GA , GA alone systemic analgesia . Purpose The purpose study compare GA systemic analgesia GA PVB . The parameter examine pain score , perioperative opioid analgesia requirement , PONV . Complications PVB also examine . Hypothesis GA plus PVB reduce pain score rest movement , need rescue analgesia , incidence PONV . Study population : Patients Breast Cancer list surgery University Hospital Alberta Cross Cancer Hospital . The study commence follow ethical approval . Power calculation require determine recruitment number . Methods : The study population identify breast surgeon clinic , potential recruit provide information regard study protocol technique day . Patient consent obtain investigate team ( study coordinator anesthesiologist ) day surgery . Randomisation participant also occur time . For randomised PVB group , block place sedation one Acute Pain Service experience paravertebral block . The sham block group receive subcutaneous saline ultrasound guidance , mild sedation local anesthetic skin infiltration . All patient receive standard GA post-operative protocol . Patients wish enrol study receive general anesthetic plus appropriate analgesia accord operating room anesthesiologist . No data record , apart fact decline take part study . Primary outcome measure : 1 . Post-operative analgesia requirement Secondary outcome measure : 1 . Maximum pain score 24 hour follow surgery 2 . Incidence PONV require additional treatment . 3 . Maximum pain score recovery rest shoulder abduction 4 . Incidence perioperative complication 5 . Intraoperative opioid requirement Safety Concerns : Paravertebral block use many year . Major complication rare . The investigator hypothesise ultrasound reduce complication anatomical structure directly visualize . Major concern : 1 . Pleural puncture pneumothorax 2 . Paravertebral hematoma 3 . Intrathecal local anesthetic injection 4 . Local anesthetic toxicity 5 . Paravertebral infection Minor concern : 1 . Block failure 2 . Epidural spread local anaesthetic 3 . Low blood pressure 4 . Horner 's Syndrome 5 . Injection site hematoma Study Protocol 1 . Paravertebral block The patient review study investigator move block area . Paravertebral block sit follow intravenous access , commencement IV crystalloid , standard patient monitoring . A time confirm side surgery mark . Sedation oxygen commence prior insertion block . The patient position seated position side surgery clearly mark . The level transverse process T2 T3 identify use ultrasound , injection 1 % lidocaine skin . Tissue movement hydrolocation confirm block needle position , anterior movement pleura end point . Once reach , 20cc ropivacaine 0.2 % inject . The patient progress standard anesthetic protocol . 2 . Sham block The patient take block area , IV monitor connect usual . Sedation oxygen commence . The sham block occur describe true paravertebral block , include injection lidocaine anesthetize skin , except small amount normal saline ( volume leave anesthesiologist 's discretion ) inject subcutaneously instead injection ropivacaine next nerve . On operating table , routine plus Bispectral ( BIS ) monitoring attach . If midazolam administer , 0.03mg/kg give intravenously ( IV ) . Fentanyl 1 microgram per kilogram IV give . Propofol titrate allow insertion laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) , unless intubation necessary . This discretion operate room anesthetist . Propofol via pump give 200mcg/kg/min , aim BIS score 35 50 . Phenylephrine ephedrine titrate necessary maintain mean arterial blood pressure 60 , great 75 % start mean pressure . Spontaneous ventilation pressure support use maintain end tidal carbon dioxide level less 50mmHg . Fentanyl ( 25mcg bolus ) titrate respiratory rate 8 - 15 breath per minute . Ketorolac 15mg Ondansetron 4mg IV give unless contra-indicated . 3 . Post-operative Protocol All patient receive standard post-operative order : Patients receive tramacet 3 tablet PO . Morphine 2mg IV give every 5 minute require pain reported Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) great 5 . If intolerant morphine , hydromorphone 0.4mg IV use . Further Ondansetron 4mg follow 2 dos Dimenhydrinate 25mg give nausea and/or vomit . Oxygen use maintain saturation great 93 % . Acetaminophen 975mg 6 hourly Ibuprofen 400mg meal three time daily give . Failure regime control pain trigger addition rescue analgesia . Rescue analgesia : Tramadol - 50 - 100mg po Q6h prn Oxycodone 5 - 10mg po Q3h prn Hydromorphone - 1mg sc Q2h PRN The patient assess prior PARR discharge regard pain score rest movement , morning follow surgery . 4 . Data Collection Data collect study sheet . Information keep confidential patient identifier form , apart study number . This reference list keep securely investigator contain patient ' ULI number . The pre- intra-operative data record : demographic ( age , weight , height ) , surgical procedure , amount fentanyl , ephedrine phenylephrine propofol use . The recovery data record : amount morphine hydromorphone require , anti-emetics give , maximum pain score recovery rest shoulder abduction . After discharge recovery , data record : anti-emetic use , rescue analgesia use , maximum pain score first 24 hour rest movement .</detailed_description>
