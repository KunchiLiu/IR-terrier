	<brief_title>Investigating Effects Probiotic Yogurt Reducing Levels Environmental Toxins Among School Children Mwanza , Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A group 60 first year student Lake Primary School recruit inclusion study . After gain consent child 's caregiver , child give participant number blood , urine fecal sample collect child qualified personnel NIMR . Children randomize two group ( n=30 ) match age , sex weight , one receive 100 g probiotic yogurt contain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 group receive equivalent portion milk . After 30 day consume yogurt milk , sample collect . Samples ship back London , Ontario Canada dry ice analysis . Blood urine analyze via high-resolution sector field inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry ( HR-SF-ICP-MS ) determine level toxic heavy metal ( Mercury , Lead , Cadmium , Arsenic ) . This carry London Health Sciences Trace Elements laboratory Canada . Urine also analyze via gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) determine level pesticide Biotron Facility ( University Western Ontario ) . We also examine urine via NMR potential host metabolic change response probiotic instillation . Bacterial community DNA sample extract analyzed determine gastrointestinal microbiota child administration probiotic yogurt determine effect yogurt gut microbiome . Briefly , DNA extract Qiagen Stool DNA extraction kit bacterial community 16S rRNA gene amplify use barcoded primer specific variable region within gene . The sample pool sequenced Ion Torrent platform ( London Regional Genomics Center , Canada ) . Reads process analyze use custom script well Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology ( QIIME ) tool , leading package microbiota analysis .</detailed_description>
