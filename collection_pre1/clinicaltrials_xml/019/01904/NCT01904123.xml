	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose WP1066 give participant recurrent cancerous brain tumor melanoma spread brain . The safety drug also study . WP1066 design target STAT3 pathway cancer cell , make cell divide , increase new blood vessel tumor , cause cancer cell move throughout body brain , avoids detect immune system . Targeting pathway may cause immune system kill cancer cell . This first study use WP1066 human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial WP1066 Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma Brain Metastasis From Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If participant find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 6 group 1-6 participant enrol Part 1 study , 6 participant enrol Part 2 . Up 12 participant surgery tumor study enrol Part 3 . If participant enrol Part 1 , dose WP1066 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level WP1066 . Each new group receive high dose WP1066 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose WP1066 find . If participant enrol Part 2 Part 3 , receive WP1066 high dose tolerate Part 1 . If participant enrol Part 3 , additional tumor test advanced MRIs perform describe . Study Drug Administration : Participant take WP1066 mouth 2 time per day Monday , Wednesday , Friday Weeks 1 2 28-day cycle . For 2 hour 2 hour dose , participant must fast ( nothing eat drink except water ) . If participant miss dose , may take within 24 hour . However , 24 hour since participant suppose take WP1066 , need contact study doctor . For first last dose Cycle 1 , participant take WP1066 clinic time blood test do . If participant first enrol participant study group , watch 1 hour first dose Cycle 1 , vital sign check every 15 minute . The study doctor may decide low participant 's dose study drug side effect . Participant write time dose WP1066 study drug diary give . Participant bring diary clinic end cycle . Study Visits : At every visit , participant ask new drug may take , include vitamin , herb , supplement . Participant also ask change health , feel , side effect may . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Participant physical neurological exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Participant 's performance status record . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test receive WP1066 8 time 10 hour dose . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - Participant EKG check heart function . On Day 2 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw PK test . On Day 8 Cycle 1 , blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 14 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn PK test receive WP1066 8 time 10 hour dose . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw PK test routine test . On Day 22 Cycle 1 Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 2 , blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 2 : - Participant physical neurological exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Participant 's performance status record . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - Participant EKG check heart function . On Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond : - Participant physical neurological exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Participant 's performance status record . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Every 8 week , participant Part 1 Part 2 , MRI check status disease . Every 8 week , participant melanoma , CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . If participant Part 3 , leftover tumor tissue surgery test immune response find STAT3 tumor . Before surgery , surgery , every 8 week , participant advance MRI check status disease . The advanced MRI special MRI take hour half longer usual , provide detailed information study area brain tumor . These detailed picture call `` treatment response map , '' show clear difference tumor non-tumor tissue brain . Information advance MRI allow researcher learn brain tumor tissue relate immune response brain . If study doctor think need , certain test may repeat time . If convenient , participant blood urine collection routine test do local clinic lab instead MD Anderson . Length Study Drug Dosing : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : At 1 2 month participant 's last study drug dose : - Participant ask change health , feel , side effect may . - Participant physical neurological exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Participant 's performance status record . - Blood ( 6 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . WP1066 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 33 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically confirm progressive brain metastasis melanoma melanoma recurrent/progressive malignant glioma ( glioblastoma , anaplastic glioma ) , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . 2 . Patients must measurable disease brain , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension &gt; =10 mm brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . MRI brain ( without gadolinium enhancement ) perform use standard 5mm slice 2.5mm space comparison subsequent MRI scan . 3 . In case malignant glioma patient , must previously undergo standardofcare treatment include surgery , radiation , first line adjuvant chemotherapy prior experimental treatment ( WP1066 ) . In case melanoma patient brain metastasis , may previously undergo resection ( radiographic evidence progression ) , undergone Gamma Knife radiosurgery ( radiographic evidence progression ) , whole brain radiation , treat systemic therapy fail . 4 . Age &gt; =18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use WP1066 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; =2 , Karnofsky Performance Scale score &gt; =60 % . 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; =3,000/mcL , absolute neutrophil count &gt; =1,000/mcL , platelets &gt; =100,000/mcL , total bilirubin within normal institutional limit , AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; =2.5 X institutional upper limit normal , creatinine within normal institutional limit OR , creatinine clearance &gt; =60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal .

Furthermore , brain melanoma metastases commonly hemorrhage , toxicity may inappropriately attribute WP1066 set . It PIs discretion enroll patient small , asymptomatic brain hemorrhage , patient symptomatic hemorrhage exclude . 11 . Patients require escalation corticosteroid dose exclude , patient receive stable decrease dose least one week eligible . 12 . Because one secondary objective PFS base radiographic volumetric analysis tumor , presence diffuse leptomeningeal disease exclusion criterion study . This secondary inadequacy measure extent tumor burden within set poor prognosis patient . 13 . The cardiac toxicity WP1066 unknown . Thus , patient mean correct QT interval ( QTc ) interval &gt; 450 ms base line exclude . Concomitant use agent prolong QT interval avoid . 14 . Malignant glioma patient within 12 week completion radiation concurrent temozolomide exclude . 15 . Melanoma patient large symptomatic brain metastasis , neurosurgical removal indicate eligible trial . 16 .
