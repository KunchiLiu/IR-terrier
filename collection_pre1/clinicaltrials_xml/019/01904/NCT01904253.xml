	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Comparing TAS-102 Versus Topotecan Amrubicin Treat Small Cell Lung Cancer Following Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , two-arm , randomized Phase 2 study TAS-102 versus Investigator 's choice therapy patient require second-line chemotherapy SCLC refractory sensitive first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . Investigator 's choice therapy define second-line chemotherapy IV topotecan ( Europe/Japan ) IV amrubicin ( Japan ) . Patients stratified response first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( sensitive v refractory ) . Sensitive patient define patient progress within 90 day last dose , refractory patient define patient never respond respond radiologic progression &lt; 90 day last dose .</detailed_description>
