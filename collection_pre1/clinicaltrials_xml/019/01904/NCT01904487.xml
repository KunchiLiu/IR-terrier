	<brief_summary>Background : - This study do examine role chemical GABA brain alcohol dependent patient . GABA chief inhibitory neurotransmitter central nervous system . It help induce relaxation sleep balance brain inhibit over-excitation . Several study report anxiety disorder panic attack , seizure disorder , numerous condition include addiction , relate low GABA activity . Therefore , examine difference GABA level healthy control subject alcohol addiction . Studies important understanding role GABA alcohol addiction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization 11CFlumazenil Image GABA Transmission Healthy Adult Subjects Subjects With Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : - By compare two PET scan ( tiagabine ) do day , understand much GABA brain make activity GABA receptor brain . Eligibility : - Individuals 18-45 year age heavy drinker healthy control . Design : - Procedures determine eligible take part research study call `` screening procedure '' . This require come investigator office approximately ½ day . For research study , screen procedure include comprehensive psychiatric medical evaluation . Participants ask abstain drug alcohol duration study require make trip several time week two week provide clean urine sample . - During one visit prior PET scan , participant magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) take brain . - We use technology call Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , method use take picture body , case , brain . We inject radiotracer call [ 11C ] flumazenil . A radiotracer small amount drug radioactivity attach . Because radiotracer temporarily stick GABA receptor brain , PET scan measure activity GABA receptor measure amount radiotracer . You undergo two PET scan [ 11C ] flumazenil one day study . After first PET scan , give oral dose tiagabine ( Gabitril® ) , medication approve treatment seizure disorder . Tiagabine raise level GABA brain . It use study measure change GABA level . Blood sample draw PET scan .</detailed_description>

Medically Healthy Subjects alcohol dependence : 1 . Males Females 1845 2 . Fulfill DSMIV Diagnosis Alcohol Dependence 3 . Negative Urine Drug Screen 4 . Negative Urine ETG/ETS 5 . Medically Healthy 6 . Abstinent alcohol minimum 1 month prior scan procedure Healthy Control Subjects : 1 . Pregnancy lactation , lack effective birth control 15 day scan 2 . Presence positive history serious medical neurological illness , include low hemoglobin . 3 . Any use ( within recent past 6 week ) amphetamine , opiate , cocaine , ecstasy PCP . 4 . Metal implant paramagnetic object contain within body may interfere MRI scan ( limited , pacemaker , presence metallic fragment near eye spinal cord , cochlear implant . Dental filling present risk MRI ) , determine consultation neuroradiologist accord guideline set forth follow reference book commonly used neuroradiologists . 5 . Currently employ radiation worker ; participation radioactive drug research protocol within previous year total cumulative annual radiation dose ( i.e. , participation previous research study study ) would exceed radiation dose limit specify FDA regulation 21 CFR 361.1 , Radioactive Drugs Considered Generally Safe Effective ( i.e . annual cumulative radiation dose limit = 5 rem gonad , bloodforming organ , lens eye , whole body ; 15 rem organ ) . 6 . Subjects know hypersensitivity flumazenil benzodiazepine ; subject give benzodiazepine control potentially lifethreatening condition ( e.g. , control intracranial pressure status epilepticus patient show sign serious cyclic antidepressant overdose ) Subjects alcohol dependence : 1 . Pregnancy lactation , lack effective birth control 15 day scan 2 . Presence positive history serious medical neurological illness cardiovascular disease , low hemoglobin 3 . Any current major axis I psychiatric diagnosis except alcohol dependence ( subject nicotine dependence exclude ) 4 . Metal implant paramagnetic object contain within body may interfere MRI scan ( limited , pacemaker , presence metallic fragment near eye spinal cord , cochlear implant .
