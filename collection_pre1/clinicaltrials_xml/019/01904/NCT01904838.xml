	<brief_summary>The overall objective study develop test efficient set self-report instrument measure Complementary Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) -relevant contextual factor important healing . The initial phase study involve develop refine item bank . During initial 'item bank development ' phase , investigator run focus group cognitive interview individual participate CAM conventional medicine intervention . The next step instrument development call Calibration , involve administer revise item bank internet sample person receive service CAM clinic conventional primary care set . The item calibrate use item response theory classical test theory . This result computerize adaptive test version instrument , well static short form instrument . This current protocol ClinicalTrials.gov pertain Calibration Phase study . The final phase project involve conduct initial validation study set instrument . The set instrument call Healing Encounters Attitudes Lists ( HEAL ) . The investigator evaluate convergent , discriminant , predictive validity HEAL instrument sample 200 person chronic low back pain receive physical therapy , chiropractic care , mindfulness-based stress reduction . For convergent validity , HEAL expect display moderate large correlation measure similar construct . The HEAL expect correlate modestly self-report measure general psychosocial functioning , support discriminant validity . Finally , HEAL score account significant proportion variance treatment outcome , support predictive validity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Healing Context CAM : Instrument Development Initial Validation - Calibration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project develop test set patient self-report measurement tool assess perceive contextual factor , patient attitude expectation , patient provider relationship factor , environmental factor contribute heal . Our project synergistic National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Roadmap initiative , Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) , use rigorous instrument development validation methodology PROMIS . The overall objective study develop efficient self-report instrument measure CAM-relevant contextual factor important healing , hereafter refer Healing Encounters Attitudes Lists ( HEAL ) , conduct initial validation person seek CAM conventional treatment pain . Specific Aim 1 : Develop item bank . We employ several iterative step use successfully PROMIS identify item assess contextual factor heal relevant CAM . Initial step develop item bank include : ) compilation evaluation exist instrument relevant question , b ) consultation expert , c ) focus group individual participate CAM conventional medicine intervention , ) item edit . During initial year study , expect identify conceptual area potential importance CAM intervention patient , identify edit item create item bank assess conceptual area . Specific Aim 2 : Calibrate item . We use item response theory ( IRT ) classical test theory ( CTT ) calibrate item Aim 1 three sample : 1 ) internet-based sample ( n= 1400 ) , 2 ) 125 outpatient participate CAM intervention Center Integrative Medicine ( CIM ) , 3 ) 125 outpatient General Internal Medicine clinic . During year 2-3 administer item item bank 1650 person , conduct IRT CTT analyse refine item bank item best ass construct . Specific aim 2 result Computerized Adaptive Testing ( CAT ) version HEAL , maximize information minimize patient time burden . A static short form HEAL derive HEAL CAT Aim 2 . Specific Aim 3 : Conduct initial validation study . We evaluate convergent , discriminant , predictive validity Healing Encounters Attitudes List ( HEAL ) sample chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) patient receive CAM conventional medicine treatment . The validity study use two sample adult CLBP : 100 person receive CAM treatment : chiropractic manipulation ( CM ) mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) CIM , 100 person receive conventional care ( physical therapy ) Centers Rehab Services refer General Internal Medicine Clinic ( GIMC ) University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) . We administer CAT version HEAL questionnaire develop aim 1 2 well conventional measure treatment expectancy , confidence treatment provider , psychosocial functioning , treatment outcome measure CLBP pain disability . • Hypothesis 3a : Scores HEAL measure display moderate large correlation ( r 's &gt; .50 ) similar self-report measure , support convergent validity . • Hypothesis 3b : Scores HEAL measure correlate modestly ( r 's = .20-.35 ) self-report measure general psychosocial functioning , support discriminant validity . • Hypothesis 3c : HEAL score account significant proportion variance treatment outcome sample . In addition , predict HEAL score demonstrate incremental validity , i.e. , account significant incremental variance outcome beyond account exist measure treatment expectancy relate construct .</detailed_description>
