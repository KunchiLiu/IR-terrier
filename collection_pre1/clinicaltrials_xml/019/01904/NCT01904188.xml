	<brief_summary>The aim project test utility Gene-Z device clinically obtain bodily fluid sample take patient suspect sepsis base three four positive Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome marker . Specimens collect Sparrow Laboratories McLaren Greater Lansing laboratory , process store analysis later date determine microbial pathogen identify current method culture , well pathogen susceptibility antibiotic culture result , identified GeneZ technology accurately . It affect current patient care impact patient care , continue standard fashion today sepsis . Results compare standard culture result antibiotic sensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Microbial Species Antibiotic Resistance Identification Patients Presenting Emergency Department With Three Four Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) Criteria - Rapid Identification Possible Accurate ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dramatic improvement timely effective treatment patient afflict sepsis achieve implementation modern technology identification offend microbial specie innate genetic antibiotic treatment target . Our collaborative team planning address need use Point-of-Care ( POC ) device equip identification bacterial specie within 20 minute routine Emergency Department laboratory blood draw urine collection , follow target analysis innate genetic antibiotic resistance element within little 7 hour time . This revolutionary improvement clinical management critical improving patient outcomes disease syndrome highly prevalent worldwide , consume massive amount medical resource daily , threatens continue worsen give current antibiotic stewardship practice . Early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) standard medical intervention shape across field modern clinical setting , range trauma neurosurgery cardiology infectious disease . Rapid accurate diagnosis , pair aggressive effective intervention , manifest stem disease process well maintain economically feasible care improve long-term morbidity . The effort apply EGDT patient high risk systemic infection , sepsis , initiate decade ago Rivers colleague Emergency Department set . Systematic approach early sepsis identification intervention include broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage , adequate fluid volume resuscitation yield definite improvement patient outcome health care resource utilization . It recognize one limiting factor treatment sepsis hospital set timeliness pathogen identification implementation appropriate antimicrobial therapy . The current `` gold standard '' sepsis microbial identification blood culture , take 3-5 day definitive specie identification . Antimicrobial agent susceptibility give organism generally garner within timeframe . However , period take specimen collection culture result , empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage , often involve multiple antibiotic , must provide ensure organism eradication . This proposal aim use Point Care ( POC ) testing , describe laboratory , accurately identify pathogenic microorganism patient suspect sepsis within 20 minute laboratory blood draw urine collection . The scope proposal feasible 20 organisms account 87 % microbial infection identify culture-based technique Sparrow Hospital , represent great Lansing , Michigan area , 50 microorganism would account virtually every microbial infectious specie ( Khalife , 2011 , unpublished data ) . To date validate approach laboratory-processed sample Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus . POC test expand include additional microorganism commonly encounter sepsis patient . Secondarily , antimicrobial resistance gene scan use functional genomics approach highly-parallel quantitative PCR perform laboratory previous study explore microbiota porcine gastrointestinal tract .</detailed_description>
