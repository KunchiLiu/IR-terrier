	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Pain Control Versus Standard Treatment Emergency Department HIP Fracture Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture ( HFx ) painful orthopedic emergency commonly present Emergency Department ( ED ) . There approximately 320,000 HFx diagnose annually United States , number expect increase population age . It previously show patient pain HFx undermedicated ED , particularly overcrowd facility . Current treatment ED patient experience pain acute HFx often intravenous morphine sulfate ( IVMS ) . Morphine many undesirable side effect , particular concern delirium , hypotension respiratory depression . These complication may accentuate elderly patient may necessitate increased patient monitoring great utilization limit ED resources.An alternative systemic opioid analgesia involve peripheral nerve blockade . Anesthesiologists frequently perform nerve block peri-operative post-operative period control pain patient undergo hip surgery . Traditionally , nerve stimulators use place nerve block . However , ultrasonography use increase frequency facilitate placement peripheral nerve block . As Emergency Physicians ( EP ) become facile use bedside sonography , ultrasound guide peripheral nerve blockade HFx may ideally suit ED environment , one injection could control pain many hour . The 3-in-1 femoral nerve block ( FNB ) , anesthetic inject adjacent femoral nerve also affect lateral femoral cutaneous obturator nerve , show effective morphine pain control HFx ED . Sonographic guidance show increase success rate block , decrease time analgesia , decrease amount local anesthetic need achieve adequate regional anesthesia , decrease incidence inadvertent intravascular injection . To date , limited research describe utilization ultrasound guide femoral nerve block ED set . Beaudoin et al . perform feasibility study demonstrate EP could effectively perform ultrasound guide femoral nerve block . Reid et al . find significantly decreased time complete analgesia use sonographic guidance compare anatomic landmark technique . In later study , anesthesia assess check skin sensation . Neither study utilized 3-in-1 nerve block , may provide great pain relief patient HFx . The fascia iliaca compartment block ( FIB ) also effective treat pain due HFx . It show pediatric anesthesia pediatric emergency medicine literature provide adequate analgesia , may provide effective analgesia FNB femur fracture child . Most study describe FIB perform use technique base anatomic landmark . One recent study describe ultrasound guidance FIB ( UFIB ) increase efficacy sensory blockade ( 12 ) . UFIB previously study ED set . We attempt determine ( 1 ) whether ultrasound guide peripheral nerve block ( UPNB ) could safely perform ED setting , ( 2 ) whether UPNB would effective standard treatment control pain HFx 2.5 unit decrease pain score consider clinically significant , ( 3 ) two UPNB superior pain relief .</detailed_description>
