	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional phase I/II clinical trial concomitant local hyperthermia proton beam radiotherapy patient primary recurrent unresectable soft tissue sarcoma extremity , trunk , retroperitoneum ( except intrabdominal ) . The primary purpose would assess safety efficacy approach along local tumour regression subsequent tumour downstaging , thereby enable near total removal tumour follow hyperthermia proton beam therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperthermia Proton Therapy Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperthermia would deliver Kantonsspital Aarau ( KSA ) superficial deep hyperthermia treatment unit may appropriate . All patient would undergo pre-hyperthermia treatment planning temperature around 41.5 Centigrade 42.5 Centigrade would aim hyperthermia sessions.Hyperthermia would deliver week treatment session would last around 60 minute active heating . Proton bean therapy would carry Center Proton Therapy , Paul Scherrer Institute ( PSI ) , Villigen use scan beam proton therapy . A preoperative dose 55 - 60 Gray equivalent ( GyE ) consider radical treatment , 72-76 GyE would deliver , 5 day week 1.8 - 2 Gy/fr . On day hyperthermia KSA proton therapy PSI , time interval two treatment could 90 150 minute , take consideration time travel two institution . Hyperthermia day would follow proton beam therapy .</detailed_description>

For recurrent tumour , prior biopsy do elsewhere , histopathology would review study pathologist . 2 . Primary STS extremity , trunk ( except intrabdominal ) retroperitoneal , 1 . Deemed inoperable study surgeon 2 . Not feasible limb spar surgery possible R0/R1 resection per study surgeon , 3 . Patient medically unfit undergo surgery 4 . Patient refuse surgery 3 . Recurrent STS extremity trunk would eligible 1 . Deemed inoperable study surgeon 2 . Not feasible limb spar surgery possible R0/R1 resection per study surgeon , 3 . Patient medically unfit undergo surgery 4 . Patient refuse surgery 5 . Had receive prior radiotherapy propose site treatment . 4 . All patient extremity STS stag T2 G2 3 M0 ( Stages IIB III per American Joint Committee Cancer , AJCC 2010 ) , would include . For patient STS trunk , tumours less 5cm may also include consider unresectable . 5 . Age 18 year 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group , ECOG performance scale 0 1 7 . Female patient must use effective contraception ; must pregnant lactate 8 . Life expectancy atleast 2 year base age comorbidities , exclude diagnosis STS 9 . Absence psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition could potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule 10 .

Patients must sign study specific informed consent form prior registration . 1 . Histopathology rhabdomyosarcoma , extraosseous Ewing 's , primary neuroectodermal tumour , aggressive fibromatosis ( desmoids tumour ) , dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans , gastrointestinal stromal tumour , osteosarcoma , chondrosarcoma , Kaposi 's sarcoma angiosarcoma scalp/face/neck 2 . Prior radiotherapy site treatment 3 . Intrabdominal soft tissue sarcomas 4 . Use neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior radiotherapy surgery 5 . Patients regional nodal metastasis 6 . Patients unequivocal distant metastasis 7 . No prior concurrent malignancy surgically treat squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin area present malignancy situ carcinoma skin 8 . No serious medical illness would prevent informed consent limit survival le 2 year 9 . Active uncontrolled bacterial , viral fungal infection condition correct control . 10 .
