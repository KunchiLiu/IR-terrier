	<criteria>All subject : At least 50 kg body mass index ( BMI ) within 1838 kg/m2 . CYP2C9 wildtype ( CYP2C9*1 homozygous carrier ) Renal impairment : Subjects must either mild , moderate severe renal impairment All subject Use investigational drug within certain timeline Donation loss 400 mL blood plasma within eight ( 8 ) week prior initial dose History cardiac rhythm abnormality cardiac rhythm abnormality identify 24h Holter ECG record include episode bradycardia ( HR &lt; 50 bpm ) waking hour and/or arrhythmic episode ; subject history presence ventricular rhythm disturbance ( ventricular extrasystole &gt; 100/24h , high grade ) , supraventricular arrhythmia ( occasional supraventricular ectopic beat maximum 5 subsequent ectopic beat per event ) subject conduction disturbance ( high AVblock grade 1 ) bradycardia tachycardia . Women childbearing potential History malignancy organ system History presence symptomatic postural hypotension syncope . Total WBC lymphocyte count fall outside 1.5fold local laboratory normal range platelet count &lt; 30,000/Î¼L screen baseline . Clinically significant infection recent vaccination liveattenuated vaccine . History presence hepatitis B C and/or positive Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Hepatitis C test result screening . Renal impairment : History presence noncontrolled clinically significant disease could affect study outcome would place patient undue risk . Any surgical medical condition renal impairment might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , may jeopardize safety study subject case participation study .
