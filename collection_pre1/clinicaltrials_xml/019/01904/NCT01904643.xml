	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide use combination mitoxantrone hydrochloride , etoposide , cytarabine ( MEC ) patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . II . To determine dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) combination patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether combination lenalidomide prim prior re-induction chemotherapy MEC clinical activity patient relapse refractory AML . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . LENALIDOMIDE PRIMING : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) 5 7 day . RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive etoposide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour , cytarabine IV 3 hour , mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 15-30 minute day 1-5 . Patients fail achieve blast count &lt; 5 % 21 day may receive second course induction therapy . Patients achieve complete remission proceed lenalidomide priming . LENALIDOMIDE PRIMING : Within 4-6 week , patient receive lenalidomide PO 5 7 day proceed consolidation therapy . CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive etoposide IV 1 hour , cytarabine IV 3 hour , mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 15-30 minute day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 28-35 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
