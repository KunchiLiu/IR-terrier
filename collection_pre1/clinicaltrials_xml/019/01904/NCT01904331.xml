	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Long-term Outcome Cardiac Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Due screen progress treatment overall survival woman treat breast cancer increase last decade . Therefore , long-term effect breast cancer emerge important topic . An increased mortality see within year post treatment due increase incidence cardiac dysfunction among survivor breast cancer . This increase mortality relate long term side effect treatment chemotherapy radiotherapy . Earlier study topic focus specific patient group therefore result difficult translate general population . Furthermore , echo graphic study focus systolic dysfunction heart , late stage cardiac deterioration . Detecting cardiotoxicity early provide opportunity early treatment might therewith prevent deterioration cardiac function improve prognosis patient Objectives : Primary objective 1 . To assess risk systolic / diastolic cardiac dysfunction echocardiography breast cancer patient compare matched control . Secondary objective : 2 . To assess risk heart failure ( combination clinical complaint , objective measure physical examination , laboratory examination echocardiography ) breast cancer patient compare match control 3 . To determine value patient characteristic , clinical complaint sign physical examination diagnose cardiac dysfunction find echocardiography 4 . To determine additional diagnostic value biomarkers ; N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro-BNP ) high sensitive troponin T ( hs-troponinT ) diagnose cardiac dysfunction , find echocardiography 5 . Genetic analysis Study design population : This cross-sectional , observational study woman general practice curatively treat breast cancer chemo / radiotherapy minimum 5 year ago age general practitioner ( GP ) match female control population . Patients must 18 year old , young 80 time diagnosis , treat type cancer chemo- and/or radiotherapy must willing give write informed consent Primary study parameter 1 . Systolic diastolic cardiac function echocardiography 2 . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) 3 . Multi dimensional Fatigue Inventory ( MFI-20 ) 4 . Cardiovascular Risk Management ( CVRM ) 5 . Short physical examination : blood pressure , height , weight , waist circumference , electrocardiography , sign edema , auscultation 6 . Laboratory testing : Hemoglobin , hematocrit , leucocytes , creatinine , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , cholesterol , triglyceride , High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , Low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , Cholesterol/HDL ratio , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , glucose 7 . Serum plasma biomarkers 8. ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) -tube DeoxyriboNucleic Acid ( DNA ) analysis Outcomes Primary outcome : The cardiac dysfunction relate type therapy compare age-and general practice match control group . Information type therapy gather trough contact hospital patient treat . Secondary outcome : Symptoms sign woman cardiac dysfunction compare without cardiac dysfunction . A comparison woman treat breast cancer woman without breast cancer make . The level biomarkers link cardiac dysfunction . In woman treat breast cancer chemo- and/or radiotherapy also link type therapy . DNA analysis carry investigate change candidate gene relate development cardiac dysfunction . Burden risk associated participation , benefit group relatedness The minimal invasive test perform patient willing participate de study contact trough letter . As far know serious adverse event link describe study procedure . With study hope get insight risk cardiac dysfunction chemo- and/or radiotherapy woman treat breast cancer . And determine possibly diagnostic measure detect deterioration . Eventually , may contribute early detection cardiac dysfunction woman treat chemo- and/or radiotherapy breast cancer improve prognosis patient .</detailed_description>
