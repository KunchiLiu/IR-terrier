	<brief_summary>This study enroll 10 adult chronic spinal cord injury . The investigator image damage motor tract use MRI tractography scanning , investigator formally assess ASIA motor level outset study . Then , investigator treat one year 'over counter ' dosage selenium vitamin E. These two vitamin know anti-oxidants . After one year investigator repeat MRI scan ASIA assessment determine change appearance motor tract MRI tractography , motor level ASIA exam . As pilot study investigator primarily concern establish safety intervention , view conduct large rigorous control trial future . The investigator also small hope fact improvement might find vitamin treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label prospective pilot study . The result study assist researcher organize large study . The objective study determine treatment counter nutrient ( Vitamin E Selenium ) may improve recovery patient remote traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The investigator enroll 10 adult remote traumatic spinal cord injury . The participant experience injury least one year prior enrollment , currently live community . Participants may neurological cause weakness ( i.e . stroke traumatic brain injury ) , must able undergo MRI scanning , able take oral medication prescribe . At begin study , baseline strength measure standardize ( American Spinal Injury Association ) exam . This exam repeat one year take treatment . Furthermore specialize radiological imaging ( MRI tractography ) spinal cord complete prior take medication , one year subsequently . MRI tractography advance image technology able generate quantitive image nerve fiber tract spinal cord control limb movement . We anticipate treatment Vitamin E selenium one period year increase ASIA motor score and/or increase nerve density nerve tracts spinal cord control limb movement</detailed_description>
