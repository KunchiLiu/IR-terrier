	<brief_summary>The project use exome sequencing search genetic predisposition familial colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Except certain syndrome today good method identify individual hereditary high risk CRC ( 25 % case ) . There currently routine screen population Norway CRC today . Coloscopy , reliable method , demand respect resource , painful , may complications . This project attempt find genetic determinant identification individual increase risk familial CRC . Such method reduce unnecessary medical examination unaffected family member , make easy focus health service individual increase risk . This represent significant contribution towards improve health reduce death rate cause CRC . The project include research ethical aspect , particular challenge relate feedback donor handle .</brief_summary>
