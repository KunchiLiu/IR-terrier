	<brief_summary>There adult skeletal muscle weakness ( call `` myopathy '' ) heart muscle weakness ( call `` cardiomyopathy '' ) low blood level compound call carnitine cause problem . Carnitine important energy production muscle . In fact , report people carnitine deficiency develop myopathy cardiomyopathy completely reverse carnitine treatment . The main objective project determine number patient carnitine deficiency cause myopathy cardiomyopathy . The investigator measure carnitine level 1000 patient cardiomyopathy describe specific feature study patient see trend may help u predict patient muscle weakness risk develop low carnitine level . The investigator treat patient low carnitine level carnitine observe see cardiomyopathy muscle weakness improve . Knowing exact percentage myopathy cardiomyopathy patient carnitine deficiency may allow screen patient cheap target way treat serious complication condition , include heart failure sudden death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Carnitine-Responsive Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective research determine prevalence primary secondary ( genetic acquire ) carnitine deficiency patient limb girdle weakness hypertrophic idiopathic dilate cardiomyopathy underlying cause unknown . Identification treatment carnitine may potentially reverse halt heart failure skeletal muscle weakness patient . Specific aim : 1 . To ascertain prevalence primary secondary carnitine deficiency population adult myopathy hypertrophic dilate cardiomyopathy unknown etiology 2 . To describe demographic phenotypic characteristic patient myopathy dilate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy primary secondary carnitine deficiency 3 . To measure motor cardiovascular response carnitine supplementation patient myopathy , cardiomyopathy carnitine deficiency</detailed_description>
