	<brief_title>Causal Inference Research Resistant Hypertension Treatment With Chinese Approach Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Syndrome differentiation one substantial characteristic Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) still lack scientific evidence.The inference method causal relationship treatment clinial effect real-word study may help . Objectives : This study aim assess efficacy Phlegm Stasis Syndrome differentiation method treat resistant hypertension explore causal inference real-world study . Research design method : It multi-center , prospective , two-arm , cohort study include 200 patient resistant hypertension ( doctor ' diagnosis base American Heart Association criterion 2008 ) .Essential hypertension subject , age 18-70 year , blood pressure &gt; 140/90mmHg even use 3 medication month diagnose Phlegm Stasis Syndrome included.Thiazide diuretic and/or two antihypertensive agent 8 week , Chinese herb ( synchronic treat phlegm blood stasis ) nonpharmacological recommendation initiate observational group control group receive intervention without Chinese herb . Outcome measure : The primary outcome Systolic ( SBP ) Diastolic ( DBP ) blood pressure reduction change symptom signs.Cardiac event death incident secondary outcomes.Possible side effect adverse reaction arise treatment like diarrhea record . Discussion : This rigorous methodology pilot study 200 patient enough calculate sample size later formal trial .</detailed_description>
