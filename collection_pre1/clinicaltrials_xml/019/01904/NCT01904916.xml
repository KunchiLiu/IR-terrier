	<brief_summary>Our knowledge genetic mutation cancer rapidly expand increasingly test drug mainly metastatic cancer patient population rare mutation . Successful examples new strategy ALK inhibitor ALK translocate NSCLC ( less 5 % frequency ) EGFR inhibitor EGFR mutant NSCLC ( approximately 5 % frequency ) . Selecting molecularly stratify patient population study benefit patient increase odds obtain benefit experimental treatment , especially early clinical trial . Moreover increase speed efficacy drug development sign efficacy pick early phase . Therefore , broad screen molecular lesion tumor patient consider participation trial crucial . This pre-selection increase ability perform several trial parallel thus include patient meaningful trial . With still dismal prognosis patient metastatic cancer , increase accrual rate pivotal trial select patient population key factor improve prognosis . The advent Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) platforms enable u probe limit number cancer relate gene within 2-4 week . We extensively pilot approach able deliver clinically meaningful turn-around-times . This development enable u use technology enrich clinical trial use targeted therapy patient specific mutation . We obtain tumor biopsy metastatic locally advanced lesion peripheral blood sample patient include trial ; biopsy obtain information tumor relate genetic mutation ( mutational profile ) blood sample assess patient 's germline DNA background variation . As patient ask undergo invasive procedure important address potential safety issue . Review literature experience show tumor biopsy perform minor complication acceptable risk . We recruit patient metastatic locally advanced solid tumor patient potentially include clinical trial .</brief_summary>
