	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn safety give kind immune cell call `` natural killer '' ( NK ) cell standard chemotherapy allogeneic stem cell transplant ( use cell donor ) . Researchers also want learn high tolerable dose NK cell give . Immune system cell ( NK cell ) make body attack foreign cancerous cell . Researchers believe NK cell receive donor may react leukemia cell body , help eliminate leukemia , prevent disease relapse .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NK Cells Prevent Disease Relapse Patients High Risk Myeloid Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose Levels : If agree take part study , assign dose level NK cell base join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue 6 dose level , high tolerable dose NK cell find . The day receive stem cell transplant call Day 0 . The day receive stem cell transplant name minus sign ( - ) . The day receive stem cell transplant name plus sign ( + ) . You receive 1 2 chemotherapy treatment choose doctor . The treatment select base age health . The type include high-dose regimen reduced-intensity regimen . Study Drug Administration ( High Dose Regimen ) : On Day -8 , admit hospital give fluid vein . On Day -7 , receive melphalan vein 30 minute . On Days -7 -4 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour . Fludarabine melphalan give treat cancer lower immune system order low risk body reject NK cell . On Day -3 , receive total body irradiation ( TBI ) . TBI involve delivery high dos radiation design destroy cancer cell and/or low immune system order low risk body reject new stem cell . On Day -2 Day -1 , receive NK cell vein 30 minute . On Day -1 , `` rest '' ( receive chemotherapy ) . On Day 0 , receive donor 's stem cell vein . The infusion last anywhere 30 minute several hour . On Days +3 +4 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour . Cyclophosphamide give low immune system order low risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD -- transplant immune tissue , donor NK stem cell , attack tissue recipient 's body ) . You also receive mesna vein 30 minute every 4 hour total 10 mesna dos Days +3 +4 . Mesna give low risk side effect bladder cause cyclophosphamide . Starting Day +5 , receive tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) help low risk GVHD . Tacrolimus give vein non-stop 2 week . After 2 week take tacrolimus vein , take tacrolimus mouth pill least 4 month transplant . MMF give mouth , 3 time day , usually 6-7 month . Starting Day +7 , receive filgrastim injection skin 1 time day , blood cell level high enough . Filgrastim design help growth type healthy white blood cell fight infection . On Day +7 ( +/- 1 day ) 3-12 week later , receive NK cell vein 30 minute . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Drug Administration ( Reduced Intensity Regimen ) : If study doctor think need due illness age , receive reduce intensity regimen . On Day -9 , admit hospital give fluid vein . On Day -8 , receive melphalan vein 30 minute . On Days -7 -4 , receive fludarabine vein 1 hour . On Day -3 , receive total body irradiation ( TBI ) . TBI involve delivery high dos radiation design destroy cancer cell and/or low immune system order low risk body reject new stem cell . On Day -2 Day -1 , receive NK cell vein 30 minute . On Day -1 , `` rest '' ( receive chemotherapy ) . On Day 0 , receive donor 's stem cell vein . The infusion last anywhere 30 minute several hour . On Days +3 +4 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 3 hour . You also receive mesna vein 30 minute every 4 hour total 10 mesna dos Days +3 +4 . Mesna give low risk side effect bladder . Starting Day +5 , receive tacrolimus MMF help low risk GVHD . Tacrolimus give vein non-stop 2 week . After 2 week take tacrolimus vein , take tacrolimus mouth pill least 4 month transplant . MMF give mouth , 3 time day , usually 6-7 month . Starting Day +7 , receive filgrastim injection skin 1 time day , blood cell level high enough . Filgrastim design help growth white blood cell . On Day +7 ( +/- 1 day ) 3-12 week later , receive NK cell vein 30 minute . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Testing : Before send home hospital and/or clinic , receive additional write instruction . These instruction include often come hospital/clinic , standard drug take home , side effect may . After finish chemotherapy cell infusion , follow-up care routine standard care follow-up patient receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation receive . At visit , physical exam . You ask side effect may . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw test genetic makeup function infuse NK cell check status disease week first 4 week transplant , 3rd NK cell infusion 1 week later , 3 , 6 , 12 month transplant , possible . This may repeat , doctor think need . Length Treatment : Your active participation study 12 month transplant . You study 2 year transplant . Between Years 1 2 transplant , study staff may check medical record see . You may take study early doctor think best interest , disease get bad come back requiring treatment , intolerable side effect occur , enough NK cell collect , unable follow study direction . If reason want leave study early , must talk study doctor . It may life-threatening leave study start receive study drug receive stem cell transplant blood cell count dangerously low . This investigational study . The study drug FDA approve commercially available treatment blood cancer and/or stem cell transplant . The way researcher process NK cell infusion investigational FDA approve . Up 45 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
