	<brief_summary>HER2 positive breast cancer cell HER2 receptor ( protein surface cell ) normal breast cell . Approximately 30 % patient breast cancer HER2 positive breast cancer . Before HER2 target therapy ( i.e . treatment directly block receptor HER2 ) develop , patient HER2 positive breast cancer aggressive form disease . With use trastuzumab , anticancer drug directly target receptor HER2 , recently , pertuzumab ado-trastuzumab emtansine , patient able live long well control cancer . Unfortunately use HER2 target therapy increase risk heart problem reason treatment study approved patient normal heart function . In study plan give HER2 target therapy patient HER2 positive breast cancer mildly decrease heart function along concomitant evaluation heart doctor ( call cardiologist ) appropriate medication strengthen heart . We frequent monitor heart function test call echocardiogram give u detailed `` picture '' heart . We also draw blood along routine blood test try understand patient develop heart problem others . The study take maximum 12 month patient monitor 6 additional month . We hypothesize safe administer HER2 target therapy patient breast cancer mildly decrease heart function , i.e . LVEF 40 50 % , appropriate heart medication .</brief_summary>
