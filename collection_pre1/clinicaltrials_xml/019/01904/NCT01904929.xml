	<brief_summary>The objective project clarify improve efficiency standardize walk-test Cardiovascular Rehabilitation . The psycho-metric property 400m walk test self-selected speed evaluate . Such test , make self-selected ( `` comfortable '' , `` free '' ) speed particularly assess endurance capacity . The result physiological measurement test compare TM6min Test Fast Walking 200m ( TMR200m ) maximal treadmill exercise . Stable coronary patient , age 55 year old , include . This study permit simplification well understanding clinical-use walk test . In future , two kind test might propose different distance , 1- 200m-fast-walking-test aim evaluate performance close maximum capacity , 2- self-selected-walk-test double distance ( 400m ) aim evaluate aerobic capacity adaptation body response effort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Patient receive enlightened information research . Patient affiliate healthcare insurance . Patients agree participate study . Patient male female age 55 . Chronic coronary patient complete rehabilitation program . Patient able understand simple order . Indication outpatient rehabilitation coronary angioplasty + stenting , surgical coronary revascularization ( coronary artery bypass ) , acute coronary syndrome ( STEMI NO STEMI ) stable angina suite . Patient guardianship tutelage Arrhythmia pace maker ( make criterion heart rate unusable ) . Congestive heart failure leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45 % measure transthoracic echocardiography accord Simpson 's method assay plasma Nterminal probrain natriuretic peptide ( NTproBNP3 ) time value use healthy subject analytical laboratory University Hospital Dijon . Severe obstructive cardiomyopathy . Aortic valve . Thrombus intra cavitary . Severe pulmonary hypertension ( &gt; 70 mm Hg ) . History venous thromboembolism last 3 month . Heart Transplantation . Chronic motor impairment associate neurological ( e.g . sequelae stroke , impaired balance coordination ) musculoskeletal origin ( e.g. , osteoarthritis , osteoarthritis ) , secondary functional impairment limit ability work predominantly relation adaptation stress . Severe medical disorder associate significantly alteration functional capacity ( respiratory failure , metabolic disorder nonstabilized progressive renal failure ) involve vital prognosis short medium term ( neoplasIC pathology progressive , systemic disease , nonstabilized ) .</criteria>
