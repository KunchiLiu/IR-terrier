	<brief_summary>The cause Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) currently unknown . Both environmental genetic factor find contribute PD pathogenesis . The pathology PD distribute throughout entire nervous system include central , peripheral , enteric nervous system . There evidence inflammation play major role neurodegeneration PD . In striatum substantia nigra PD patient activate microglia find proinflammatory cytokine ( TNF , IL-1B , IL-6 , iNOS ) increase CSF . An inflammation-driven animal model emerge widely accept model disease base lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) induce neurotoxicity . LPS endotoxin find outer membrane gram negative bacteria human expose LPS intestinal tract . The intestinal tract thus enteric nervous system serve conduit central nervous system . It posit inflammatory process could gain access low brainstem via vagal nerve ascend basal mid- forebrain reach cerebral cortex , produce various pre-motor motor symptom PD along way . LPS may one inflammatory trigger involve process . Systemic exposure bacterial endotoxin determine measure plasma LPS bind protein ( LBP ) . A study 9 patient early PD ( median Hoehn Yahr stage 2 ) age match control find PD subject significantly low mean level plasma LBP compare control subject . The aim research plan establish LBP potential biomarker PD across spectrum disease severity .</brief_summary>
