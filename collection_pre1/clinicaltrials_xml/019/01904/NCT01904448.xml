	<brief_summary>To purpose feasibility study demonstrate safety efficacy Nucleus 24 Multichannel Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI , Cochlear Corp , Sydney , AUS ) child without diagnosis neurofibromatosis type II ( NFII ) either experience fail cochlear implantation ( CI ) unable receive CI secondary cochlear cochlear nerve disorder . These condition include : developmental acquire cochlear nerve deficiency ( CND ) , cochlear aplasia ( Michel ) , post-meningitic cochlear ossification cochlear malformation . This study propose implant 10 young child ( &lt; 5 yr . age ) Nucleus 24 Multichannel ABI ( Sydney , AUS ) attempt demonstrate safety surgical procedure , tolerance device stimulation , potential auditory benefit beyond experienced CI . This study provide preliminary experience large scale clinical trial . Aim 1 : Demonstrate safety ABI surgery child . Aim 2 : Demonstrate development sound awareness improve speech understanding among child implant ABI compare baseline skill . Aim 3 : Demonstrate development oral language skill follow use ABI evident prior use .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Prelinguistic hearing loss ( birth5 yr . ; age ABI 18 months5yrs ) : MRI +/ CT evidence one following : Cochlear nerve deficiency , Cochlear aplasia severe hypoplasia , Severe inner ear malformation , Postmeningitis ossification When cochlea present patent , lack significant benefit CI despite consistent use ( &gt; 6 mo . ) Postlinguistic hearing loss ( &lt; 18 yr . age ) : Loss lack benefit appropriate CI without possibility revision contralateral implantation . Examples might include : Postmeningitis ossification , Bilateral temporal bone fracture cochlear nerve avulsion , Failed revision CI without benefit Previously develop open set speech perception auditoryoral language skills No medical contraindication Willing receive appropriate meningitis vaccination No limited cognitive/developmental delay would expect interfere child 's ability cooperate test and/or programming device , develop speech oral language , would make implant subsequent emphasis aural/oral communication child 's best interest Strong family support include language proficiency parent ( ) child 's primary mode communication well write spoken English . Reasonable expectation parent include thorough understanding : potential benefit limitation ABI parental role rehabilitation child may develop spoken language primary communication mode even sufficient spoken language make significant academic progress aural/oral environment Involvement educational program emphasize development auditory skill without use supplementary visual communication . Able comply study requirement include travel investigation site . Informed consent procedure child 's parents/legal guardian . Pre postlinguistic child currently make significant progress CI MRI evidence one following : normal cochlea cochlear nerve NFII brainstem cortical anomaly make implantation unfeasible Clear surgical reason poor CI performance remediate revision CI contralateral surgery rather ABI . Intractable seizure progressive , deteriorate neurological disorder Unable participate behavioral test mapping CI . If appear age effect , ABI delay assure child able participate , reliable objective measure map currently available map device . Lack potential spoken language development . This consider case evidence follow exist : Severe psychomotor retardation , autism , cerebral palsy , developmental delay beyond speech would preclude usage device oral educational development . Autism special case potential delay presentation . When early sign consider present , group routinely request comprehensive developmental assessment evaluation prior consider routine evaluation . A specialized group readily available institution evaluation . Unable tolerate general anesthesia ( cardiac , pulmonary , bleed diathesis , etc. ) . Need brainstem irradiation Unrealistic expectation part subject/family regard possible benefit , risk limitation inherent procedure prosthetic device . Unwilling sign inform consent . Unwilling make necessary followup appointment .</criteria>
