	<detailed_description>This multiple-center , open-label , PK study cefazolin child age 10 12 year ( inclusive ) receive 1g 2 g cefazolin deliver via DUPLEX® drug delivery system surgical prophylaxis . Surgery expect last long 3 hour . If second dose cefazolin require , subject exclude PK analysis additional subject enrol necessary obtain eight evaluable subject . The surgical procedure may perform outpatient inpatient set subject must available complete plan 8-hour PK sample note . Study drug administer continuous infusion 30-minute period use infusion pump . Based weight Day 1 ( Day Surgery ) ( unless weight assessment obtain within previous seven day physician judgment felt represent stable weight potential change subject dose may affect ) . Subjects weigh ≥25 kg &lt; 50 kg receive 1g dose . Subjects weigh ≥ 50 kg ≤ 85 kg receive 2g dose . Dose group balance age gender . The weight-based dosage regimen employ study select assure subject receive dose 20 40 mg/kg body weight , base Monte Carlo simulation use adult PK data , consistent current practice . Blood sample determination PK cefazolin drawn follow time : 15 minute start infusion ( baseline ) , end infusion , 15 30 minute 1 hour , 2 hour , 3 hour , 6 hour , 8 hour end infusion total nine blood sample . Safety assess monitor adverse serious adverse event base patient history , vital sign , physical examination .
