	<brief_summary>Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , inherit genetic disorder , cause irreversible brain damage , decline executive function , autistic tendency unless phenylalanine ( Phe ) restrict diet consistently maintain throughout life . Promoting anabolism , uptake free amino acid extracellular space , key component maintain plasma phenylalanine concentration within treatment range among patient PKU . Exercise promote muscle protein synthesis anabolism , effect blood phenylalanine concentration patient PKU report . Our objective assess impact acute bout moderate intensity exercise protein oxidation plasma amino acid concentration , potential adjunctive therapy patient PKU . The investigator hypothesize moderate intensity exercise decrease amino acid oxidation , increase muscle protein synthesis , promote tissue uptake essential amino acid , thereby lower plasma phenylalanine concentration patient Phenylketonuria .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The indicator amino acid oxidation technique utilizes carbon label isotope ( L- [ 13C ] ) tracer ingest orally measure expired breath . This method base theory one essential amino acid deficient , amino acid oxidize break-point reach time amino acid incorporate muscle protein synthesis . Using randomized crossover design investigator plan investigate effect acute bout moderate intensity treadmill exercise versus sedentary activity plasma amino acid four subject PKU . The long-term goal novel research determine exercise could use adjunctive therapy improve management plasma phenylalanine level promote normal , healthy quality life among patient PKU . Patient Recruitment : Four post-pubertal participant range 14-17 year age classical phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , treat Oregon Health &amp; Science University , participate pilot study . Participants recruit routine clinic visit Doernbecher Children 's Hospital Metabolic clinic . Study Design : This randomize crossover clinical trial compare effect moderate intensity exercise sedentary activity amino acid oxidation plasma amino acid pool use indicator amino acid oxidation technique . Each participant study two separate occasion one-month period .</detailed_description>
