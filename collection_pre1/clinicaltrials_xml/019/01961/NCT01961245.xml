	<brief_summary>It show , patient severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) additional use non-invasive ventilation pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) may enhance benefit PR . It assume non-invasive ventilation technique provide good recovery respiratory pump night . If non-invasive ventilation also decrease metabolic demand night unknown aim study . During 3 week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program total 85 patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage IV recruit study . There 4:1 distribution 2 group . 68 patient indication use non-invasive ventilation involve intervention group non-invasive ventilation initialize . 17 patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stage IV without indication use non-invasive ventilation involve control group detect change nocturnal energy expenditure produce pulmonary rehabilitation alone . All outcome measurement perform day 1-3 repeat 12 day ( without non-invasive ventilation ) day 15-17 pulmonary rehabilitation program . A sub-trial study validate night movement accuracy Dynaport activity monitor observation make night-vision camera sleep lab . This perform study participant well healthy volunteer .</brief_summary>
