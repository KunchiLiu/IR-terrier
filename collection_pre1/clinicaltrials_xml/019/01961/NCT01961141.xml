	<brief_summary>Historically , ultrasound unable provide interpretable data lung parenchyma , mainly high total ultrasound energy attenuation scatter air lung . Recently show clear reproducible Doppler signal record lung parenchyma mean pulse Doppler ultrasound system incorporate special signal processing package ( transthoracic parametric Doppler , TPD , EchoSense Ltd. , Haifa , Israel ) . These lung Doppler signal ( LDS ) full synchrony cardiac cycle obtain lung , include area remote heart main pulmonary vessel . The LDS wave typically peak velocity 30 cm/s relatively high power , make possible detect despite aforementioned attenuation air lung . The LDS think represent radial wall movement small pulmonary blood vessel , cause pressure pulse wave cardiac origin propagate throughout lung vasculature . The LDS may contain information significant diagnostic physiological value regard pulmonary parenchyma vasculature , well cardio-vascular system general . Preliminary data ongoing study employ TPD chronic disease CHF , COPD pulmonary hypertension , show promise regard diagnostic potential lung Doppler signal ( unpublished data ) . However , lung Doppler signal acute disease state investigate far . It reasonable speculate pathological process underlie acute cardiovascular pulmonary disease affect LDS . Therefore , TPD may diagnostic potential condition . For example , acute pulmonary embolism portion pulmonary vascular system occlude ; therefore 's reasonable assume LDS disappear affect area , enable confirm diagnosis without use ionize radiation ( CT lung scan ) . Another example COPD exacerbation , usually air trapping lung ; thus , LDS may attenuate increase air volume lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Lung Doppler Signals Patients Presenting EMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Study Purpose Rationale To evaluate LDS patient various acute cardiovascular and/or pulmonary disease state , order characterize signal assess diagnostic utility acute condition . B . Study Design The study design open , prospective , non-interventional study . 100 patient recruit Rambam Emergency Medicine Department ( EMD ) 18 month period . Study population consist patient present EMD acute cardiovascular and/or pulmonary condition , including- restrict to- pneumonia , pulmonary embolism , CHF exacerbation , COPD exacerbation , shock , etc . Following informed consent apply inclusion exclusion criterion , eligible patient undergo routine physical examination include vital sign measurement ( blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , O2 saturation pulse oximetry ) , auscultation lung . The patient would also undergo ECG chest X-ray part routine evaluation . Blood test additional imaging procedure do accord clinical indication . Lung Doppler signal record select location right chest wall , preferably sit semi-reclining position ( patient 's condition permit ) . The recording repeat several time EMD monitor change follow treatment . In case , LDS recording may also repeat later EMD hospital ward patient recovers acute condition ( usually towards end hospital stay ) . The acquired Doppler data save PC off-line processing analysis use special algorithm develop purpose . The medical chart enrol subject also access obtain study specific information . The information collect include ( limited ) : date birth , gender , height , weight , past medical history , medication , physical examination , ECG , blood test , pulmonary function test ( include spirometry lung volume ) , chest X-ray/CT Echocardiography result . The result study test procedure disclose EchoSense Ltd . Since study non-interventional , TPD recording use guide medical treatment decision . TPD recording interfere administer optimal treatment patient , first priority recruit subject . C. Study Device The lung Doppler signal acquire Sonara/tek Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) system . This commercially available TCD system approve Federal Drug Administration November 3rd , 2006 510k class II device . This device approve mean measure blood flow velocity within brain well peripheral blood vessel . We utilize non-invasive Doppler system investigational manner record lung Doppler signal . The record signal later analyze EchoSense signal processing package .</detailed_description>
