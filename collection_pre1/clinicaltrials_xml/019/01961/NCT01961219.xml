It painful disable condition cause frustration patient caregiver due slow recovery time . It important meticulously diagnose source symptom . Adhesive capsulitis treatment non-operative therapy physical therapy , exercise , steroid &amp; pain medication . For patient quick return function necessary ; th situation operative treatment option . This study compare two surgical technique adhesive capsulitis . Purpose 1 . To directly compare outcome patient adhesive capsulitis fail pain management fail improvement range motion least 3 month supervise , regiment conservative treatment subsequently randomize either closed manipulation anesthesia arthroscopic capsular release . 2 . To blind patient assess physician/nurse study coordinator treatment receive duration study . This reduce effect potential bias result much possible . 3 . To collect outcome data , subjectively patient use proven outcome measure , objectively regularly space follow visit blind assessor . 4 . To collect comment data two treatment group regard duration post-operative narcotic use , duration post-operative physical therapy require , post-operative pain level , elapse time back work/activity post-operatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Manipulation Under Anesthesia Versus Arthroscopic Capsular Release Treatment Adhesive Capsulitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Shoulder pain one common cause musculoskeletal disability adult population . Adhesive capsulitis one multitude pathologic entity cause shoulder pain dysfunction . The condition see frequently clinic primary care provider orthopedic surgeon . Patients develop adhesive capsulitis typically present complaint pain progressive loss active passive motion shoulder . The disease course adhesive capsulitis extensively study . Despite , controversy remain natural history disease . It generally believe adhesive capsulitis self-limiting process typically last twelve thirty-six month . In one retrospective study 50 patient 10 year follow , Miller et al7 find significant improvement range motion resolution pain patient treat conservatively . In another study , show 90 % patient treat stretching exercise program alone report satisfactory outcome mean follow 22 months8 . This would mean 10 % patient suffer long-term problem . Shaffer et al9 , however , report 50 % patient treat nonoperatively still complain residual pain , stiffness , average follow 7 year . Despite evidence disease improve without intervention , many patient want wait potentially long two three year resolution . For patient , unreasonable proceed intervention aim resolution pain improvement motion . Levine et al10 provide insight predict patient might benefit proceed surgery . He find patient report severe symptom , young age symptom onset , continue reduction motion least four month physical therapy likely eventually require surgery . The course progression untreated adhesive capsulitis describe continuum three clinical phases4 . The first phase characterize pain term 'freezing ' phase . In phase , patient experience gradual onset diffuse shoulder pain progressive course week month . In general , pain begin restriction motion . Patients may report pain night often relate difficulty sleep affected side . As use arm decrease secondary pain , stiffness begin set . Phase two characterized stiffness know 'frozen ' phase . This phase may last four twelve month . Patients see pain slowly decrease , however , limitation motion continually increase . Phase three know 'thawing ' phase may last five twenty-six month . This characterized resolution pain slow improvement range motion . Most author agree long 'freezing ' phase associate longer 'thawing ' phase . Adhesive capsulitis initially treat nonoperative therapy . The goal conservative management control pain improvement maintenance range motion . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication may prescribe help control pain . Physical therapy without home exercise program always employ . This do gentle manner without cause much pain . Treatment oral injectable corticosteroid make theoretical sense give proven inflammatory nature condition . Studies examine treatment oral steroid versus placebo treatment yield short-term improvement week . No improvement show long-term follow six eight months1 . There also many study examine role intra-articular steroid injection treatment adhesive capsulitis . Similarly , study also show short term ( 3weeks ) improvement pain function improvement hold longer follow ( 3-6 month ) 1 . Jones et al11 look role suprascapular nerve block treatment option find significant improvement pain shoulder range motion three month follow compare group patient receive intra-articular injection corticosteroid . This suggest benefit short-term long-term data reveal improvement lasting . Limited investigation perform determine role hydrodilation viable treatment option . This involve injection enough fluid intra-articularly cause capsular rupture . No level I study perform one level II study do suggest improvement pain Constant score six months1 . Closed Manipulation Under Anesthesia ( MUA ) test short long-term follow proven beneficial tool treatment adhesive capsulitis patient fail nonoperative therapy . In report result MUA perform patient stage 2 adhesive capsulitis , Dodenhoff et al12 report 94 % satisfied procedure mean follow 11 month . In look long-term outcome MUA , Farrell et al13 show improvement pain motion continue average 15 year follow via patient questionnaire . There recent trend toward arthroscopic capsular release treatment refractory adhesive capsulitis treatment option become popular MUA . This rise popularity arthroscopic capsular release occur perceived benefit improve outcome low risk complication even though high level trial compare two option . Ogilvie-Harris et al14 , level III study , report cohort patient treat arthroscopic capsular release . He note patient twice likely pain free 2 year follow similar cohort underwent manipulation anesthesia . Pollock et al15 report level IV study , 83 % excellent satisfactory result arthroscopic debridement rotator interval perform concomitantly MUA . Warner et al16 able demonstrate significant improvement patient treat arthroscopic capsular release fail MUA . This level IV study perform patient treated postoperative shoulder stiffness , however ; adhesive capsulitis . Both surgical method ( MUA arthroscopic capsular release use practice .</detailed_description>
