	<brief_summary>SEVERE ASTHMA IN THE COMMUNITY- BACKGROUND Severe asthma common problem . In world approximately 300 million people asthma estimate 5 % patient severe asthma . Although `` severe asthma '' comprise small fraction entire asthmatic population share total economic burden asthma 80 percent . In Israel prevalence asthma among adult patient 5-6 % prevalence severe asthma unknown . The definition severe asthma change year . Most recently 2009 WHO agree unified definition `` severe asthma '' would fit country different socioeconomic development [ 1 ] . Severe asthma include 3 different group : group one `` untreated severe asthma '' , group two `` difficult treat severe asthma '' group three `` treatment-resistant severe asthma '' . As asthmatic patient Israel easy access medical care , current study deal last two group ( `` difficult treat asthma '' `` treatment resistant asthma '' ) . AIMS Primary endpoint : 1 . To identify prevalence severe asthma community accord WHO definition group two &amp; three . 2 . To assess whether anti-IgE therapy ( Omalizumab ) , consider group severe asthma .

PROTOCOL : The study include patient age interval 20-70 year bronchial asthma treat CMS , Sharon-Shomron district . The total population age interval insured CMS district 347,374 . A . Screening computerized database CMS detect patient age interval 20-70 year computerize title-diagnosis bronchial asthma period January 1st -December 31 , 2011 . ( preliminary data show total asthmatic population age interval 20,651 patient ( 5.94 % entire population ) . B . To detect database asthmatic patient consider `` severe asthma '' accord level medication prescribe ( adjust basis severe/refractory asthma definition ATS workshop consensus 2000 ) [ 2 ] . C. To detect fraction patient co-morbidities and/or potential trigger ( computerized title-diagnosis ) may interfere asthma management ( WHO group two : potentially `` difficult treat severe asthma '' ) . Severe asthmatic without co-morbidities /triggers consider WHO group three `` treatment resistant severe asthma '' . D. To detect fraction patient `` severe asthma '' underwent evaluation anti IgE-therapy . E. To evaluate sample `` severe asthma '' population ( WHO group two three ) asthma outpatient clinic Meir Hospital ( estimate basis preliminary data , 200-250 patient ) . If absolute number patient either WHO group two group three exceed 150 , patient invite . If number exceed 150 , second patient , consecutively accord computerized list , invite . F. Patients invite asthma outpatient clinic evaluate pulmonary physician complete specific questionnaire regard asthma control level ( include non-scheduled use medical resource ) , medication adherence , co-morbidities , smoke history , potential asthma trigger , level asthma education , quality follow-up care potential adverse event patient receive anti-IgE therapy possibly relate specific therapy . G. All patient undergo post bronchodilator spirometric evaluation , assessment blood cell count peripheral eosinophil , total IgE blood level skin test aeroallergens . H. Stages F G protocol accomplish one visit outpatint visit study . Inclusion criterion : A . Age 20-70 year old B . A computerized diagnosis-title `` bronchial asthma '' , stage severity . A subgroup asthmatic patient consider `` severe asthma '' accord ATS workshop consensus definition severe/refractory asthma , base level prescribe medication criterion 2000 : C.

Prescription SABA , either Ventolin OR Bricalin inhaler least quarter year least 4 inhaler 12 month OR least one prescription month inhalation-solution Ventolin Bricalin month . E. Prescription oral IM corticosteroid , least twice last 12 month . The fulfilment mention criterion indicate asthmatic patient conrolled , accord GINA definition control asthma . Asthmatics potentially `` difficult treat severe asthma '' due co-morbidities potential trigger factor sub-grouped accord criterion ( criterion potential exclusion `` treatment resistant severe asthma '' ) : A .
