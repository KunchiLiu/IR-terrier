	<brief_title>Voice Tremor Spasmodic Dysphonia : Central Mechanisms Treatment Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spasmodic dysphonia ( SD ) chronic debilitate condition , characterize selective loss voluntary voice control speech production due uncontrolled spasm laryngeal muscle . SD become even incapacitate associate action-induced voice tremor ( VT ) due poor response gold standard treatment botulinum toxin . There , therefore , critical need identify new treatment opportunity SD/VT patient receive limited , , benefit botulinum toxin injection . The design use novel therapeutic approach patient , however , largely unattainable central mechanism SD VT development remain unknown . Our long-term goal determine pathophysiology SD related disorder , VT , development new diagnostic treatment option patient . The objective application identify brain abnormality SD SD/VT patient basis characterization central mechanism underlie symptom improvement follow use sodium oxybate , novel pharmacological agent treatment ethanol-responsive dystonia . Our central hypothesis , compare SD patient , SD/VT patient additional brain abnormality within sensorimotor brain circuit control voice production , modulate great extent sodium oxybate treatment . We postulate clinical efficacy sodium oxybate treatment correlate central modulatory effect . The rationale propose research identification distinct brain mechanism underlie SD SD/VT clinical manifestation would provide necessary insight pathophysiology disorder , understand neural correlate sodium oxybate action would allow establishment scientific rationale use novel treatment disorder . Using comprehensive approach multi-modal neuroimaging clinico-behavioral testing , central hypothesis test pursue two specific aim : ( 1 ) determine disorder-specific brain abnormality SD SD/VT patient , ( 2 ) characterize central effect sodium oxybate treatment ethanol-responsive SD SD/VT patient . This research innovative focus identification distinct pathophysiological factor contribute SD VT development , also discovery mechanisms central effect novel oral medication , sodium oxybate , hold promise treatment refractory symptom SD SD/VT . The propose research significant advance understand pathophysiology dystonia general SD particular well direct impact improvement clinical management SD SD/VT patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinically document diagnosis SD and/or VT positive effect alcohol symptom ; Age 21 80 year ; Native English speaker ; Righthandedness ( base Edinburgh Handedness Inventory ) . Subjects incapable give informed consent ; Pregnant breastfeed woman time longer pregnant breastfeeding exclude study . All patient childbearing potential require agree use reliable method contraception prior treatment sodium oxybate prior receive botulinum toxin . The method contraception document patient 's research chart . All woman childbearing potential undergo urine pregnancy test , must negative study participation ; Subjects past present medical history 1. neurological disorder , except spasmodic dysphonia voice tremor , exclude study order maintain homogenous patient population , allow evaluation drug effect CNS without confound presence neurological condition , identify SD VT disorderspecific change brain function structure . Patients report past present neurological problem , stroke , movement disorder SD VT , brain tumor , traumatic brain injury loss consciousness , ataxia , myopathy , myasthenia gravis , demyelinate disease , alcoholism , drug dependence exclude . As voice tremor one form essential tremor , patient moderate severe essential tremor affect body part exclude study . All patient dystonic movement larynx body region also exclude study ; 2. psychiatric problem , schizophrenia , major and/or bipolar depression , obsessivecompulsive disorder , exclude maintain homogenous patient population , allow evaluation drug effect CNS without confound presence psychiatric condition identify disorderspecific change brain function structure ; 3. laryngeal problem , vocal fold paralysis , paresis , vocal fold nodule polyp , carcinoma , chronic laryngitis ; 4. know past present history grade 2 high hepatic renal dysfunction accord NCI criterion . ; 5. know past present history moderate severe congestive heart failure ; 6. know past present history cognitive impairment active suicidal ideation ; Patients symptomatic due treatment botulinum toxin injection laryngeal muscle . The duration positive effect botulinum toxin vary patient patient last average 34 month . All patient evaluate ensure fully symptomatic prior enter study , except substudy , examine effect combine botulinum toxin sodium oxybate treatment abnormal brain function SD VT patient ; To avoid possibility confound effect drug act upon central nervous system , study participant question prescribed overthecounter medication part initial intake screening . Those patient receive medication ( ) affect central nervous system ( except sodium oxybate ) exclude study . The participant ask whether undergone head neck surgery , particularly brain surgery laryngeal surgery , thyroplasty , laryngeal denervation , selective laryngeal adductor denervationreinnervation . Because brain laryngeal surgery may potentially lead brain structure function reorganization , subject history brain and/or laryngeal surgery exclude study . The subject tattoo , ferromagnetic object body ( e.g. , implanted stimulators , surgical clip , prosthesis , artificial heart valve , etc . ) remove purpose MRI study participation .</criteria>
