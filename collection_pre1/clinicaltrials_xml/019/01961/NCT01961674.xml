	<brief_title>Studying Effect Capsinoids Brown Fat Using Infrared Thermal Imaging .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It recently establish brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) exist adult human . BAT thermogenic tissue dissipate energy heat . The primary objective study use thermal imaging ass effect capsinoids BAT activity adult human , whether relationship increase energy expenditure BAT activity capsinoids intake . The secondary objective investigate whether capsinoids effect individual 's glycaemic response . Lean , healthy male volunteer recruit . There two test session randomize , subject consume either capsinoids placebo capsule , standardized amount white rice ( equivalent 50g carbohydrate ) . Indirect calorimetry use assess energy expenditure consumption test meal . Thermal image supraclavicular BAT , primary BAT depot human , undertaken use infrared thermal camera ass change BAT temperature . Blood glucose level monitor finger prick blood sample method . This study aim investigate whether capsinoids consumption lead change BAT temperatures detectable infrared thermal camera , confirm feasibility use thermal image rapid , noninvasive , reproducible way study BAT activity thus provide platform advance research emerge field human BAT .</detailed_description>
