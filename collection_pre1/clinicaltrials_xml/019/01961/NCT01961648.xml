	<brief_title>Respiratory Drive Obstructive Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During wakefulness pharyngeal dilator muscle ( dilator ) provide necessary force permit adequate flow subject regardless collapsible passive pharynx . This dilator activity substantially lose sleep onset . Subjects passive pharynx permit adequate ventilation must recruit dilator reflex mechanism remain asleep . Dilators recruit reflexly via change blood gas tension afferent activity pharyngeal mechanoreceptors . Patients obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) develop repetitive obstructive event air flow decrease substantially ( hypopnea ) cease altogether ( apnea ) . These last 10 &gt; 60 second follow substantial increase ventilation ( hyperventilatory phase ) last several breath . The cycle repeat . Arousal sleep occurs point hyperventilatory phase vast majority obstructive respiratory event . However show majority OSA patient , reflex mechanism competent deal obstruction without arousal . The respiratory drive must increase finite amount upper airway muscle begin respond increase respiratory drive , often patient wake first . Thus , subject narrow compliant pharynx fall asleep obstructs his/her airway , blood gas tension must deteriorate threshold amount pharyngeal dilator begin respond . Once threshold reach , dilator respond briskly change blood gas tension open airway . This threshold term Effective Recruitment Threshold ( TER ) . The basis research project respiratory drive maintain near threshold , dilator would respond promptly obstruction would little increase respiratory drive obstruction.We estimate require increase drive attain simply raise carbon dioxide pressure ( PCO2 ) 2-3 mmHg , highly tolerable increase . We intend increase respiratory drive continuous basis , begin sleep ask participant breath regular continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) mask add dead space . To increase dead-space modify commercial rebreathing bag use oxygen therapy amount rebreathing adjustable . This raise arterial carbon dioxide pressure ( PaCO2 ) millimetres mercury ( mmHg ) steady state . Upon sleep , respiratory drive would TER nearly half patient . Should airway obstruct , dilator muscle would position respond promptly , prevent acute rise respiratory drive . This reduce frequency obstructive respiratory event &gt; 50 % least half patient , improve sleep quality nocturnal oxygen saturation .</detailed_description>
