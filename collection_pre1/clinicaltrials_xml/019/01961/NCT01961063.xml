	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study gene therapy frontline chemotherapy treat patient acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -related non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Placing gene anti-human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) stem/progenitor cell may make body build immune response AIDS . Giving chemotherapy drug busulfan gene therapy help gene-modified cell engraft work well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate safety feasibility recombinant ( r ) HIV7-short hairpin RNA target HIV-1 tat/rev ( shI ) -trans-active response element ( TAR ) -chemokine cysteine-cysteine receptor 5 ribozyme ( CCR5RZ ) -treated hematopoietic stem progenitor cell ( HSPC ) ( lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cell ) infusion AIDS patient complete treatment NHL non-myeloablative conditioning busulfan . II . To demonstrate engraftment gene-modified progeny cell follow treatment . III . To determine selection gene-modified progeny cell occur analytical treatment interruption ( ATI ) combination anti-retroviral therapy ( cART ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics busulfan patient AIDS-related lymphoma ( ARL ) . II . To determine effect HIV-1 infection presence gene-marked peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) measure woodchuck post-transcriptional regulatory element ( WPRE ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) perform , , ATI . OUTLINE : Patients receive busulfan intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day -2 follow lentivirus vector rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cell IV day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 7 , 14 , 21 day 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
