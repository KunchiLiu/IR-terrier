	<detailed_description>Background : An accessory commercially available GALILEI Dual-Scheimpflug Corneal Topographer/Keratometer name `` EBR Accessory '' develop company Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG measurement intraocular distance . The combination call `` GALILEI Lens Professional '' . The measurement principle base short coherence interferometry/-reflectometry , gain wide-spread application apply clinically , include one member study group , precise measurement axial , intraocular distance ( 12.1. ) . Such EBR Accessory measurement , combination measurement GALILEI , may apply give intra-ocular lens ( IOL ) type IOL equation , permit calculation suggest IOLs implant cataract surgery , order achieve desire vision correction . To register accessory sale , precision agreement exist device similar application ( `` predicate device '' ) must demonstrate . One complete measurement consist cornea-topography/keratometry scan , follow immediately three consecutive , axial biometry scan anterior segment ( cornea crystalline lens ) - short re-alignment - three consecutive , axial biometry scan retina . The measurement process continuous , divide two step . Blinking patient possible two step , increase patient comfort , certain case , measurement success . Precision evaluate three repeat , complete measurement GALILEI Lens Professional predicate device . Two standard device comparable optical technology use routine cataract surgery declare predicate device . These two devise typically use combination standard keratometers , GALILEI Lens Professional may employ well . Goal : The comparison GALILEI Lens Professional predicate device respect precision measure postoperative , calculated target refraction cataract patient , versatility measurable quantity .</detailed_description>
