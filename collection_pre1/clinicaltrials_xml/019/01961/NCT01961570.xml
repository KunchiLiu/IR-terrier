	<brief_summary>This study evaluate performance Articulinx ICMC ( InterCarpoMetacarpalCushion ) carpometacarpal joint ( CMC joint ) describe clinical result patient treated device . Expected result include relief symptom improvement function patient symptomatic osteoarthritis ( OA ) CMC-1 joint . Evaluation device performance achieve measurement pain , pain medication use , joint function 20 subject . Each subject compare pre-surgery status endpoint .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Articulinx InterCarpoMetacarpal Cushion ( ICMC ) Osteoarthritis First CarpoMetacarpal Joint</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Articulinx ICMC minimally invasive orthopedic device intend implanted basilar , first carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint , interpositional spacer first metacarpal trapezium bone . The device intend use treatment thumb disability result osteoarthritis CMC-1 joint . The Articulinx ICMC mold polymer disc encapsulate radiopaque marker . The Articulinx ICMC design inter-positional spacer treatment symptom early-stage osteoarthritis first CMC joint . When properly position joint , ICMC preserve restore normal space trapezium thumb metacarpal bone first CMC joint . The restoration natural space biomechanics within joint expect reduce pain restore strength function . The ICMC design implant earlier OA disease process basilar joint implant . The ICMC allow active lifestyle may reduce eliminate need long-term use prescribe arthritis medication . Because ICMC procedure remove supportive bone tissue , procedure reversible treatment option later stage disease progression remain available patient . The ICMC first place EU ( European Union ) market Sponsor April , 2011 follow approval carry CE ( European Community ) Mark base upon successful pre-clinical clinical testing . In clinical study , one single site study one multicenter site study , conduct accordance ISO 14155 ( International Standards Organization ) , 1-year enrollment complete 2-year follow-up ongoing . The primary objective study document safety Articulinx ICMC evaluate Incidence unanticipated device procedure related adverse event intra-operatively , one year follow-up . The secondary objective study describe clinical radiographic outcome patient treated device . This single site study The Netherlands . Study enrollment begin follow require regulatory submissions/Ethics Committee approval site study personnel train complete . The study conduct conformance ISO 14155 evaluate performance Articulinx ICMC relief symptom osteoarthritis CMC-1 joint . Primary secondary study endpoint evaluate one year patient continue follow two year evaluation longer-term performance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient diagnose investigator medically acceptable surgical procedure ? Patient age 40 75 inclusive ? Patient symptomatic osteoarthritis carpometacarpal ( CMC1 ) joint demonstrate minimum DASH score 40 baseline ? Patient pain target CMC joint demonstrate average VAS pain score great equal 40 baseline 100mm VAS ? Patient radiographic evidence Stage II OA freefloating body CMC1 joint ? Radiographic Stage II OA define accord EatonGlickel classification system ( base upon lateral view ) follow : `` Slight narrow TM [ trapeziometacarpal/CMC ] joint present minimal sclerotic change subchondral bone . There may joint debris exceed 2 mm diameter form osteophytes loose body The ST [ scaphotrapzeial joint ] appear normal . '' Patient subluxation less onethird target CMC joint ? Patient agree return clinic followup visit require time per protocol follow requirement protocol ? Patient able willing provide voluntary consent participate ? Patient nonsymptomatic osteoarthritis first CMC joint ? Patient small bone calcific fragment ( spur , osteophyte ) target CMC joint great two millimeter ( &gt; 2mm ) diameter ? Patient free float body size within target CMC joint ? Patient radiographic/imaging evidence significant osteoarthritic change within first metacarpal , scaphotrapezotrapezoidal ( STT ) joint target wrist consistent Stage III/IV OA , accord EatonGlickel , define ? `` Stage III OA : The joint space markedly narrow obliterate cystic change , sclerotic bone , vary degree dorsal subluxation , joint debris exceed 2 mm diameter . The ST joint appear normal . '' `` Stage IV OA : There complete deterioration TM [ CMC ] joint stage III , addition , ST joint narrow sclerotic cystic change apparent .

Patient active infection , sepsis osteomyelitis ? Patient skin disease eruption CMC target site ? Patient previous surgery target CMC joint wrist target hand ? Patient significant injury target CMC joint within 6 month prior study enrollment significant permanent injury time prior study enrollment ? Patient significant comorbid medical condition could exacerbate pain symptom adversely affect physical functioning heal thumb CMC joint ( e.g . de Quervains disease , EhlersDanlos Syndrome , Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ) ? Patient corticosteroid injection target CMC joint within 6 month prior study enrollment ? Patient take concomitant immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , oral/injectable glucocorticoid , alkylating agent , antimetabolite , antibody , drug act immunophilins [ Ciclosporin , Sirolimus ] , interferon , opioids ) could adversely affect heal ? Patient uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ? Patient take anticoagulation antiplatelet therapy stop prior surgery ? Patient planning pregnancy , patient pregnant and/or lactate ? ( If subject becomes pregnant enrollment study , subject continue follow , even though may miss followup appointment . During pregnancy , Xrays perform . ) Patient participate clinical investigation could impact outcome study ? Patient known history drug alcohol abuse previous 12 month ?
