	<brief_summary>Study Title : A study compare two articular cartilage repair technique knee joint : The use Cultured Chondrocytes Vs. Cultured bone marrow aspiration cell . Study hypothesis : We start hypothesis treatment equally effective . Trial Design : The participate patient divide two group , group receive either one treatment modality . This study randomise blind . Both procedure do Spire Alexandra Hospital Professor A . A Shetty , one half team devise technique . The post-operative rehabilitation process group . Trial Participants : All participant patient attend Professor Shetty 's clinic Spire Alexandra Hospital . Planned Sample Size : 50 patient group Follow-up duration : The participate patient follow 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year follow surgery visit clinic assess clinically . The surgical outcome measure IKDC , KOOS Lysholm score ; cartilage growth measure MOCART score . Planned Trial Period : Two three year Primary Objective : To establish superiority , , either procedure study pain relief , cartilage growth improvement function . Primary Endpoint : At end 2 year follow participating patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Two Techniques Articular Cartilage Repair : Cultured Chondrocytes Vs. Cultured BMAC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Articular cartilage repair knee aim young patient area ( ) cartilage loss deformity knee . These patient n't indicate knee replacement . Articular cartilage repair lead improvement symptom pain , lock function . Traditionally , articular cartilage repair always involve expose entire knee joint arthrotomy . This , though effective , would lead large scar , long hospital stay , long rehabilitation associate complication . Also , use Bone Marrow Aspirate Cells ( BMAC ) purpose cartilage repair long debate side valid argument good surgical result . RATIONALE : In study , one method ( Cultured Chondrocytes ) require arthroscopy arthrotomy , take 6 week complete follow 6 week partial weight bear operate leg . The method ( Cultured BMAC ) do arthroscopically , follow 4 injection affect knee take 6 week complete include 6 week partial weight bear operate leg . Both procedure show encouraging result term pain relief , cartilage growth improve function . The use culture chondrocytes require two surgery take total 12 week till patient walk without support use culture BMAC involve one surgery patient walk unsupported 6 week . This study aim ascertain either technique superior . If culture BMAC technique show superior , could mean less surgery faster recovery patient . STUDY DESIGN : This study aim compare two technique articular cartilage repair knee , namely use culture chondrocytes use cultured bone marrow aspirate cell ( BMAC ) . The principal objective ascertain assess superiority , , either surgical technique . The superiority assess certain score system ( IKDC , KOOS , Lysholm MOCART ) measure pre- post-operatively . Depending procedure patient chooses , allot either cultured chondrocytes group culture BMAC group . The patient follow clinic Spire Alexandra Hospital 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year 2 year follow surgery progress document questionnaire clinical examination . MRI scan do one two year assess extent cartilage growth . SURGICAL TECHNIQUES Cultured chondrocytes : This method two stage . In first stage , knee arthroscopy do harvest viable cartilage cell send lab culture 6 week . The entry port close knee cover sterile dressing . The patient transfer surgical recovery ward , medically stable , transferred room ward . After discharge hospital , patient advise partial weight bearing operate leg six week surgery . They also undergo five session physiotherapy . Surgical clip suture remove 2 week follow surgery . In second stage , arthrotomy perform . The area cartilage deficiency prepare cultured cell transplant onto . The incision close knee cover sterile dressing . The patient transfer surgical recovery ward , medically stable , transferred room ward . After discharge hospital , patient advise partial weight bearing operate leg 6 week surgery . They also undergo 5 session physiotherapy . Surgical clip suture remove 2 week follow surgery . Cultured BMAC : This method also two major stage . The first stage involve harvest BMAC patient 's iliac crest ( hip bone ) , send laboratory culture 3 week . Simultaneously , arthroscopy perform affected knee area cartilage deficiency debrided microfractured . The entry port close knee cover sterile dressing . The patient transfer surgical recovery ward , medically stable , transferred room ward . After discharge hospital , patient advise partial weight bearing operate leg six week surgery . They also undergo five session physiotherapy . Surgical clip suture remove 2 week follow surgery . In second stage , culture BMAC inject affected knee cell attach microfractured area . The patient recall 4 , 5 6 week first stage injection Hyaluronic Acid operate knee . Follow : Patients arm follow 2,6,12,26,52 104 week follow end second stage procedure . Parameters note pain relief , improvement function cartilage growth assess MRI scan one two year .</detailed_description>
