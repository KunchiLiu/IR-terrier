	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine whether day night closed-loop insulin delivery 12 week free living condition superior addition real-time continuous glucose monitoring adult type 1 diabetes sub-optimal glucose control insulin pump therapy . This open-label , multi centre , randomise , crossover design study , involve 6 8 week run-in period , glucose control optimised professional pump educator , follow two 3 month study period glucose level control either automate closed-loop system subject usual insulin pump therapy augment real-time continuous glucose monitoring random order . A total 42 adult ( aim 30 completed subject ) age 18 year old T1D insulin pump therapy recruit diabetes clinic establish method participate centre . Subjects drop study within first 6 week first intervention arm replace . Subjects receive appropriate training safe use closed-loop insulin delivery system . Subjects regular contact study team home study phase include 24/7 telephone support . Subjects discourage international travel first two week closed-loop use . The primary outcome time spend target range 3.9 10.0 mmol/L record CGM ( adjust potential over-estimation ) home stay . Secondary outcome HbA1c , time spend glucose level target , record CGM , CGM-based metric .</brief_summary>

The subject insulin pump least 6 month good knowledge insulin selfadjustment include carbohydrate counting 4 . The subject treat one rapid act insulin analogue ( Insulin Aspart , Insulin Lispro Insulin Glulisine ) 5 . HbA1c ≥7.5 % ( 58mmol/mmol ) ≤ 10 % ( 86 mmol/mmol ) base analysis central laboratory equivalent 6 . The subject willing perform regular fingerprick blood glucose monitoring , least 6 measurement per day 7 . The subject willing wear closedloop system home work place 8 . The subject willing follow study specific instruction 9 . The subject willing upload pump CGM data regular interval 10 . Female subject child bear age effective contraception must negative urineHCG pregnancy test screening . In addition Germany , woman childbearing potential must use highly effective method birth control , define result low failure rate ( i.e . le 1 % per year ) must use two independent method contraception , e.g . diaphragm spermicidecoated condom . 1 . Nontype 1 diabetes mellitus 2 . Any physical psychological disease condition likely interfere normal conduct study interpretation study result 3 . Current treatment drug know significant interference glucose metabolism , systemic corticosteroid , judge investigator 4 . Known suspected allergy insulin 5 . Subjects clinically significant nephropathy , neuropathy proliferative retinopathy judge investigator 6 . Significantly reduce hypoglycaemia awareness judge investigator 7 . More one episode severe hypoglycaemia define American Diabetes Association ( 31 ) precede 6 month ( Severe hypoglycaemia define event require assistance another person actively administer carbohydrate , glucagon , take corrective action ) . 8 . Random Cpeptide &gt; 100pmol/l concomitant plasma glucose &gt; 4 mM ( 72 mg/dl ) 9 . Total daily insulin dose &gt; 2 IU/kg/day 10 .
