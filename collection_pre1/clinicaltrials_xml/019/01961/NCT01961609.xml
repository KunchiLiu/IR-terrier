	<brief_title>Secukinumab TNF-IR Psoriasis Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There clear evidence guideline appropriate treatment patient moderate/severe psoriasis fail respond anti-TNFα therapy , whether single anti-TNFα therapy failure multiple anti-TNFα therapy failure . Numerous double-blind , double-dummy , randomised , parallel-group , active placebo control study already design run Phase III secukinumab clinical development program , accordance Health Authorities guideline feedback , include FDA EMA . None specifically study patient fail respond anti-TNFα therapy define NICE guideline . Therefore , study utilises pragmatic , open-label , non-comparator design , show appropriate similar study look anti-TNFα therapy patient fail therapy ( Papp et al . 2012 ; Strober et al . 2011 ) , answer question whether secukinumab appropriate choice patient fail respond anti-TNFα therapy ( TNF-IR ) per NICE definition , whether single anti-TNFα therapy failure multiple anti-TNFα therapy failure .</detailed_description>
