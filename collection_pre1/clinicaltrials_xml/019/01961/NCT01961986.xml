	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective , randomized clinical trial , 120 patient require total shoulder replacement ( TSR ) . Purpose : To collect evaluate long-term clinical data patient whose total shoulder replacement ( TSR ) perform use traditional surgical approach ( call subscapularis release approach ) compare patient TSR procedure do use new surgical approach ( call rotator cuff spar approach ) . For patient arthritis , TSR successfully improve pain restore function . As result , TSR become treatment choice patient shoulder arthritis . Despite generally good outcome , however , concern rotator cuff function suboptimal surgery . One rotator cuff tendon usually cut TSR procedure insert prosthesis repair end surgery . If tendon heal adequately , patient may experience persistent weakness , pain , even failure replacement . Recently , surgical technique call rotator cuff spar TSR describe procedure perform without ever cut rotator cuff tendon . As , minimize risk rotator cuff function surgery . Our study propose enroll two group patient shoulder arthritis . The first group treat traditional TSR procedure . The second group treat new rotator cuff spar surgical technique TSR rotator cuff never violate . After surgery , examine motion , strength , functional use shoulder . In addition , specifically test rotator cuff strength surgery . In fashion , plan test hypothesis rotator cuff spar TSR improve rotator cuff function maintain excellent pain relief motion normally observe traditional TSR procedure . Enrollment : A total approximately 120 subject enrol treat NYU Hospital Joint Diseases . Subjects participate study randomly assign total shoulder replacement do use traditional surgical approach ( call subscapularis release approach ) new surgical approach ( call rotator cuff spar approach ) . For patient , number create random number generator . Patients randomize even number ( 2 ) receive traditional TSA procedure include incision repair subscapularis tendon procedure . Patients randomize odd number ( 1 ) receive rotator cuff spar TSA . Regardless procedure , patient remain `` blind '' type procedure receive completion 2 year follow . Follow-Up Requirements : Office Visits : Patients ' participation involve five ( 5 ) office visit ( surgery ) period two ( 2 ) year . At visit , part patient ' regular care , standard x-rays shoulder . All patient complete self-administered questionnaire assess clinical outcome surgery patient satisfaction . The patient administer outcome questionnaire include SF-12 , Patient Assessment Case Report Form .</detailed_description>
