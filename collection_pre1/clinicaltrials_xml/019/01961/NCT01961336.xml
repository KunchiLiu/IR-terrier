	<brief_summary>Ιt suggest accumulation androgen micro milieu primate ovary , play critical role early follicular development granulosa cell proliferation . Increased intraovarian concentration androgen seem augment follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) receptor expression granulosa cell thus , potentially lead enhanced responsiveness ovary FSH . In addition , androgen excess show stimulate early stage follicular growth increase number pre-antral antral follicle . On basis data , hypothesize increase androgen concentration ovarian micro milieu poorly respond patient might lead increase number maturity oocytes ovarian stimulation IVF . Hence , recent effort focus potential benefit androgen administration probability pregnancy poor responder undergo ovarian stimulation IVF . Pretreatment transdermal testosterone suggest safe effective way increase intraovarian androgen concentration . Recently , publish , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) evaluate transdermal testosterone poor responder undergo ovarian stimulation IVF , inconclusive result . In view conflict inconclusive data regard efficacy propose intervention , study attempt explore role transdermal testosterone pretreatment poor responder undergo IVF properly design RCT . The lack universal definition poor responder identify previously recently , attempt address issue , universal criterion definition poor ovarian response propose follow consensus meet Bologna . In present study , Bologna criterion use contrary previous study . Despite advancement assist reproduction technology , poor ovarian response ( POR ) still consider one challenge task reproductive medicine . Poor ovarian response consider inadequate response ovarian stimulation , define usually low number oocytes retrieve low number develop follicle previous run , respectively , vitro fertilization ( IVF ) cycle . Given severely diminished probability pregnancy IVF patient , identification indisputably efficacious treatment , testosterone pretreatment , would promise alternative poor responder undergo IVF .</brief_summary>
