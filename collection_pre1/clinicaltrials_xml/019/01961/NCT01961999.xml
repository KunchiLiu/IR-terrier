	<brief_summary>The question time initiation renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) , `` early '' versus `` late '' , seldom focus high-quality rigorous evaluation . As consequence , initiative aim identify `` optimal timing initiation RRT '' acute kidney injury ( AKI ) give high priority investigation Acute Kidney Injury Network ( AKIN ) . Accordingly , investigator conduct prospective , control , interventional trial , compare two treatment group variable RRT initiation strategy , determine whether `` early '' versus `` late '' initiation patient AKI cardiac surgery associate survival benefit favorable outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Late Renal Replacement Therapy After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury cardiac surgery strongly associate in-hospital mortality morbidity . This area effective treatment lack trial difficult perform . To date randomize control trial ( RCT ) sufficiently estimate impact RRT time initiation patient outcome , present prospective , control , interventional , single-center trial attempt compare patient outcome `` early '' versus `` late '' initiation RRT . Previous study cardiac surgery set retrospective one hamper lead-time bias , drop patient . To overcome bias patient underwent cardiac surgery prospectively enrol trial divide two treatment group : `` early '' approach use first 10-months , `` late '' approach next 10-months . To improve information gain non-classical randomized study minimize bias , investigator enrol almost patient exclusion criterion two follow short period , use intention-to-treat analysis treat patient accord local protocol international guideline , except RRT initiation strategy . Outcome parameter hospital mortality , ICU hospital length stay . `` Early '' therapy start 6 hour urine output less &lt; 0,5ml/Kg/h , whereas `` late '' group RRT therapy start basis persistent ( last 12 hour ) oliguria . Data obtain database analyze use `` Statistical Package Social Science '' ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL ) . Continuous variable present meanÂ±SD , categorical variable summarize frequency percentage . The Student test Pearson X square test perform evaluate difference group analyze subgroup . For statistic , p &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Power calculation base previous reports13 cumulative mortality follow cardiac surgery . 50 % reduction mortality hypothesize conservative approach cardiac surgery-AKI apply . The suggested number patient 900 patient per group . The main limitation present study include non-classical randomization , nevertheless conduct interventional trial compare two treatment strategy two different group patient , prospectively follow suitable treatment .</detailed_description>
