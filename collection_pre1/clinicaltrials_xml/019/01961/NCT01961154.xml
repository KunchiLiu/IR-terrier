	<detailed_description>Stepping asthma medication control asthma Principal investigator : Heikki Koskela , MD . Kuopio University Hospital , Unit Medicine Clinical Research , Division Pulmonary Medicine The study start year 2012 continue 36 month . Background In Finland , asthma second important disorder justify special reimbursement asthma medication , thus cause large expense society . Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) mainstay modern asthma therapy . When medium-dose ICS fail achieve asthma control , combine long-acting B2-agonist bronchodilator ( LABA ) . Unfortunately , potential side effect ICSs LABAs common increase frequency increase dozing . The common side effect ICS benign , like sore dry throat also include serious adverse effect like growth retardation child adrenal insufficiency . LABAs , turn increase risk severe asthma exacerbation even asthma-related death . Therefore , current guideline asthma management recommend , period symptom control , reduction dose cessation ICSs LABAs attempt . There two recommend strategy : The international Global initiative asthma ( GINA ) guideline recommend reduction ICS dose first , subsequent LABA cessation . On contrary , American Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recommend cessation LABAs first . In present study follow FDA recommendation . At present limited experimental data optimal timing , sequence , magnitude treatment reduction asthma . Usually , decision treatment reduction base absence symptom certain period time . However , even asthmatic subject minimal symptom may suffer asthma exacerbation treatment reduction . Consequently , physician asthmatic often reluctant reduce stop asthma medication . Very probably major reason fact great proportion asthmatic subject use unnecessarily high dos asthma medication multiple preparation . For example , Finland combination preparation contain LABA ICS commonly prescribe preparation contain ICS ( Finnish Social Insurance Institution statistic 2010 ) . Very probably many asthmatic would well even without asthma medication : In Italian study stable asthmatic , asthma medication could stop 73 % subject . There great interest find biomarker could identify asthmatic subject would tolerate treatment reduction without exacerbation reduction try . The following biomarkers evaluate predict asthma exacerbation ICS dose reduction/cessation : Airway challenge histamine , mannitol , hypertonic saline , adenosine well measurement exhale nitric oxide sputum eosinophil . In adult subject , hypertonic airway challenge ( mannitol , hypertonic saline ) adenosine challenge usually perform best respect . However , none biomarkers able predict outcome ICS treatment reduction accurately enough become part clinical routine . To knowledge , study try predict asthma exacerbation LABA cessation . Hypertonic airway challenge long use ass airway ' tendency constrict response external stimulus ( =airway responsiveness ) . Asthmatic subject well know hyperresponsive bronchoconstrictive effect hypertonic aerosol . During recent year show asthmatic subject hypersensitive also cough-provoking effect hypertonic aerosol . Furthermore , treatment ICS decrease sensitivity cough-provoking effect hypertonic aerosol . Among asthmatic , cough responsiveness hypertonic saline correlate closely well validated asthma control questionnaire . The bronchoconstrictive response cough response hypertonicity two separate phenomenon therefore provide additional information state subject 's airway . The two response measure single challenge . The cough response hypertonic aerosol never evaluate whether predict outcome asthma treatment reduction subject stable asthma . It possible analysis bronchoconstrictive cough response might predict asthma exacerbation well analysis one responses . The study objectives Subjects : 70 well-controlled asthmatic patient LABA ICS . The main objective study : 1 . To investigate whether hypertonic saline bronchoconstrictive responsiveness predict outcome asthma treatment reduction subject stable asthma . 2 . To investigate whether hypertonic saline cough responsiveness predict outcome asthma treatment reduction subject stable asthma . 3 . To investigate whether two response together strong predictive power response separately . The secondary objective get estimate large proportion Finnish stable asthmatic patient use medication unnecessarily high dos would even manage well without asthma medication . Methods Study design This prospective study physician responsible subject management medication blind saline challenge result nurse perform saline challenge blind medication . The study include two period : A two-week run-in period subject continue regular asthma medication asthma control ensure . After , step asthma medication start continued ICS LABA treatment stop asthma exacerbation occur . The effect every reduction observe six week proceed follow step . If medication insufficient , asthma exacerbation likely take place within time period . In previous study , exacerbation take place mean 16 - 17 day steroid reduction . First step : LABA discontinue . The use ICS continue , use dosage , preparation , inhaler . Second step : In subject daily ICS dose 500 ug beclomethasone equivalent ( = '' medium high dose '' ) , ICS dose reduced 500 ug beclomethasone equivalent ( = `` low daily dose '' ) accord GINA , see table 1 . The reduced ICS dose administer preparation inhaler . Third step : In subject daily ICS dose less equal 500 ug beclomethasone equivalent ( = `` low daily dose '' ) ICS stop . Non-permitted medication The use asthma drug apart ICS LABAs continue throughout study . However , study day subject use asthma drug visit outpatient clinic . All medication illness continue throughout study . Detailed description study Day 1 . The subject interview ( nurse ) baseline questionnaire asthma control questionnaire 19 fill . The suitability subject study evaluate accord above-mentioned criterion . Written , inform consent obtain . If skin allergy test perform , perform . The use asthma diary instruct . It use throughout study . A two-week diary monitoring PEF value perform . Asthma diary : Every morning evening : The number rescue bronchodilating drug dos take . Three peak flow ( PEF ) record take asthma medication . Plus every morning : Awakenings night due asthma symptom Day 2 . The diary reviewed ( physician ) . The subject include study his/her asthma well control , define asthma control questionnaire ( ACQ ) score equal less 0.75 . The final ACQ score determine saline challenge since include spirometry force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) information utilised calculating ACQ score . If subject include , write asthma medication reduction plan make , one copy give subject another stored subject file . The threshold value significant PEF reduction calculate ( see ) . The subject tell sign symptom asthma exacerbation action plan make . The saline challenge perform ( nurse ) describe . The first step-down medication perform ( LABA cessation ) . Definition asthma exacerbation , least one following : - awaken two consecutive night due asthma symptom - PEF le 3 standard deviation mean PEF value obtain run-in period three consecutive day 20 - bronchodilator use day three consecutive day . - whenever subject feel his/her asthma symptom clearly increase Individually adjust definition asthma exacerbation write asthma diary Action plan case exacerbation : The telephone number study physician give subject she/he contact office hour . The telephone number respiratory physician charge give case exacerbation occur outside office hour . The exacerbation treat accord standard clinical practice , depend physician 's judgement . An asthma exacerbation indicate end study . The contacted physician informs research nurse exacerbation . The nurse mark date exacerbation . The research nurse ask patient visit outpatient clinic two week . The subject visit study physician permanent asthma medication instruct . Action plan write asthma diary Days 3 , 4 5 . The ACQ fill diary reviewed ( physician ) . If exacerbation occur since last step-down , next step-down make . The hypertonic saline challenge perform ( nurse ) . However , previous step-down steroid cessation , study end . Hypertonic saline challenge This test perform previously describe modification : Spirometry perform three time . After subject inhales isotonic phosphate-buffered saline two minute via high-output ultrasonic nebuliser , use tidal breathing . The cough occur inhalation two minute count . The number `` spontaneous '' cough subtract cough provoke hypertonic solution . After two minute end inhalation , spirometry perform twice . The good two record FEV1 value use reference value calculate saline-induced bronchoconstriction . Subsequently , inhale hypertonic phosphate-buffered saline solution osmolalities 600 , 900 , 1200 , 1500 , 1800 2100 milliosmoles ( mOsm ) /kg . The challenge stop either 15 % fall FEV1 record final solution inhale patient feel severe discomfort . The cough response saline calculate provocative osmolality induce 15 cumulative cough . The bronchoconstrictive response calculate provocative osmolality induce 15 % fall FEV1 . If patient feel dyspnoea FEV1 fall equal 15 % baseline , Ventoline Evohaler two dose 0.1 mg /Volumatic administer . After 15 minute , spirometry perform twice . Ethics According international study , asthma patient often overmedicate , thus expose unnecessary side effect expense . Also , due vast amount asthma patient , unnecessary asthma medication cause large expense society . Therefore , present study indicate . It evident proportion subject experience asthma exacerbation study . However , full-time contact respiratory physician . In study setting , asthma medication reduction take place much control fashion everyday clinical practice . A permission Institutional Ethics Committee receive ( Number 118//2011 , date 29.11.2011 ) . The time table finance The study start year 2012 continue 36 month . The investigator seek fund Finnish government research funding ( VTR ) private foundation .
