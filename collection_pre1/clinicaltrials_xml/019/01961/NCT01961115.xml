	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II trial study well epacadostat vaccine therapy work treat patient stage III-IV melanoma . Epacadostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vaccines make peptide antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving epacadostat vaccine therapy may effective treatment advance melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epacadostat Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine extent regimen INCB024360 ( epacadostat ) normalize serum kynurenine ( Kyn ) / tryptophan ( Trp ) ratios alters tumor microenvironment melanoma , include determine number character tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte determine examination serial biopsy immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) gene signature . II . To determine extent continue INCB024360 treatment plus addition multipeptide melanoma vaccine , MELITAC 12.1 ( MELITAC 12.1 peptide vaccine ) , alters tumor microenvironment melanoma , include determine number character tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte determine serial biopsy evaluate IHC gene signature . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether regimen INCB024360 normalize serum Kyn/Trp ratio plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine change level character vaccine-induced cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ CD4+ T-cell immune response measure peripheral blood , compare prior publish experience . II . To evaluate extent INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine alters number character peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) population , include T natural killer ( NK ) cell , evaluate multiparameter flow cytometry . III . To evaluate extent INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine alters PBMC transcriptome . IV . To assess safety tolerability INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine . V. To obtain preliminary data tumor response rate INCB024360 plus MELITAC 12.1 vaccine objective response rate ( ORR ) , time tumor progression , overall survival . VI . To associate observed change expression IDO1 protein IHC tumor tumor-infiltrating cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive epacadostat orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-98 receive MELITAC 12.1 peptide vaccine intradermally ( ID ) /subcutaneously ( SC ) day 21 , 28 , 35 , 56 , 77 , 98 . Treatment epacadostat may repeat every 98 day 3 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
