	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel release well accept treatment median nerve compression wrist . With prevalence 50 per 1000 , common compressive neuropathy . With number anatomic well systemic factor play role development carpal tunnel syndrome , surprising high incidence bilaterality disease . Padua et al . report 87 % 266 consecutive case sign symptom carpal tunnel syndrome contralateral hand . In patient bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome respond conservative treatment , surgical release indicate . In case , decision must make whether offer bilateral simultaneous surgical release stage two affect hand allow time recover . The purpose study determine difference short term disability bilateral vs unilateral carpal tunnel release . With good understanding way patient impair , good recommendation may make patient indicate simultaneous bilateral procedure would benefit staging procedure , allow patient recover one hand prior proceed surgery hand .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome common compressive neuropathy , occur 0.1 3 % population . The incidence report high certain risk population . 87 % individual exhibit bilateral symptom . In patient fail conservative treatment , surgery indicate . To date , know whether patient benefit undergoing simultaneous consecutive carpal tunnel release . Some patient express concern hand operate may make impossible perform necessary activity daily live early postoperative period . Other patient express concern two surgery increase pocket cost , total disability time , lengthen amount time resolution preoperative symptom . One previous study attempt characterize difference effect activity daily live two treatment paradigm . This study limit fact comparison group study cohort . Cohort # 1 : Patients undergo simultaneous bilateral carpal tunnel release . Inclusion criterion include adult patient indicate bilateral carpal tunnel release . Exclusion criterion include age less 18 , pregnancy , protect patient population , lack assistance home early postoperative period . Cohort # 2 : Patients undergo unilateral carpal tunnel release . Inclusion criterion include adult patient indicate unilateral carpal tunnel release . Exclusion criterion include age less 18 , pregnancy , protect patient population . Once patient identify clinic consent process begin . Consent administer member research team . Being part investigation change standard treatment carpal tunnel syndrome way . After surgery , patient go home ask fill Quick DASH , Levine-Katz Severity Score , WHO HPQ , SF-6D pre-operatively first post-operative visit . They also fill activity daily live log asks patient rate scale 1 5 much difficulty task list . The patient return ADL log physician first postoperative visit . A final postoperative visit occur 1 month . The investigational questionnaire fill one last time visit . No long term follow require . Patients contact first post-operative day ensure receipt daily log , day prior first post operative visit reminder bring log clinic , day last post-operative visit thank participation study . During final phone call patient ask factor contribute decision proceed proceed undergoing bilateral carpal tunnel release .</detailed_description>
