	<brief_summary>Positron emission tomography ( PET ) non-invasive image tool monitor functional metabolic response biological event specific radiotracer vivo . The PET tracer [ 18F ] Fluciclatide 18F radiolabeled small peptide contain RGD ( arginine-glycine-aspartate ) tri-peptide , preferentially bind high affinity αvβ3 αvβ5 integrins . αvβ3-integrins express low level epithelial cell mature endothelial cell express high level activate endothelial cell neo-vasculature range tumor also may regulate angiogenesis . If pazopanib act mainly active angiogenetic tumor , quantitative uptake [ 18F ] Fluciclatide use predict effect antiangiogenic drug . The investigator expect baseline tumor uptake [ 18F ] Fluciclatide able predict treatment response , plan study [ 18F ] FluciclatidePET patient metastatic RCC receive pazopanib systemic therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18FFluciclatide PET Imaging Pazopanib Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects receive treatment pazopanib dose 800 mg orally daily . [ 18F ] Fluciclatide image take 2 time ; 1 ) systemic therapy ( baseline ) , 2 ) one week start Pazopanib . However , If target lesion baseline PET discriminate compare background activity , 2nd PET do . Response evaluation CT perform baseline , 6 week , 12 week every 8 week thereafter end treatment . RECIST1.1 criterion response apply . Patient treat Pazopanib disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal patient consent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm renal cell carcinoma , stage IV patient . The tumor mass ≥1.5cm diameter plan receive Pazopanib systemic antiangiogenic therapy . Pretreatment CT without contrast within 4 week prior first 18FFluciclatide PET scan . Evidence unidimensionally measurable lesion ( ) RECIST criterion version 1.1 . No prior systemic antiangiogenic therapy metastatic disease ; prior antiangiogenic therapy use adjuvant therapy allow complete 6 month study enrollment . Male female age 20 year Be ambulatory Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . Have life expectancy least 3 month . Adequate medical condition judgment investigator Be willing able comply protocol duration study . Be willing able implement effective contraceptive practice Give write informed consent prior studyspecific screening procedure , understand patient right withdraw study time , without prejudice . Received another IMP within 30 day first administration 18FFluciclatide injection . Inability perform 18FFluciclatide PET image study due physical inability claustrophobia . Intrahepatic tumor ( without extrahepatic tumor ) Chemotherapy within 2weeks , receive radiotherapy region target lesion , surgery target lesion within 2 week prior first 18FFluciclatide PET scan Pregnant , nurse woman patient reproductive potential without contraception . Current treatment another therapeutic clinical trial ( except Pazopanib study ) Any patient know allergy GE health care product excipients exclude study Any condition , opinion investigator , would compromise wellbeing subject study prevent subject meeting performing study requirement .</criteria>
