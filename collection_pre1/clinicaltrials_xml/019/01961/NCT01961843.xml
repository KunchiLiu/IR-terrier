	<brief_summary>This research study Pilot clinical trial . Pilot clinical trial often examine new test ( laboratory radiology test ) patient receive either standard cancer treatment new treatment well-tested many patient trial . It often difficult determine prostate cancer go behave new treatment start . Physicians way predict patient 's tumor respond treatment . Although scientist learn change happen tumor due treatment , difficult get cell tumor biopsy ( surgical procedure remove small piece tissue ) need . This study evaluate method detect tumor cell circulate blood without get biopsy . It known tumor shed small number cell blood stream every day . These call circulating tumor cell CTCs . Some early study indicate amount type CTCs blood help determine status tumor way respond treatment . In study , investigator examine protein level CTCs patient ' blood different time drug treatment determine correlate response drug . The new test affect whether subject continue study drug . Abiraterone acetate market drug study treatment metastatic CRPC . It block remain residual male hormone body may help prostate cancer grow . Abiraterone acetate FDA-approved patient metastatic CRPC yet receive docetaxel chemotherapy . Abiraterone acetate use large number participant previous clinical trial . In trial , participant CRPC give abiraterone acetate prednisone . Prednisone man-made hormone commonly refer steroid . Prednisone approve US , Canada , Europe various disorder disease , asthma , Lupus chronic obstructive lung disease . The combination prednisone abiraterone acetate approve treatment CRPC . Prednisone together abiraterone acetate give study order reduce eliminate side effect . Investigators use patient ' blood sample study gene ( also call DNA ) product ( RNA proteins ) find CTCs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient agrees participate research study , ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn patient take part research study . These test procedure include : medical history , physical exam , performance status , EKG , MUGA scan , bone scan , evaluation patient 's disease , blood test urine test . If test show patient eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If patient meet eligibility criterion , able participate . Once confirm eligible participate study , patient start treatment . Patients see outpatient setting . All patient receive study drug , abiraterone acetate prednisone . For purpose description , study treatment refer abiraterone acetate combination prednisone . Patients take 4 tablet abiraterone acetate mouth daily . Patients also take 1 tablet prednisone mouth twice day . Patients give study diary include instruction take study medication . During first two month study , patient make 3 visit clinic . Afterwards , patient visit clinic month . This study use bone scan assess worsen subject ' prostate cancer ( tumor progression ) bone . Because arthritis cause spot appear bone scan , scan repeat week later . Cancer spot remain , arthritis spot may disappear . Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) test also unreliable first week start new prostate cancer therapy . This death prostate cancer cell result new treatment release PSA lead initial high level blood . Such early rise PSA mistaken progression patient 's cancer . Cancer treatment divide period time call cycle . A cycle study last 28 day . At start cycle treatment , patient ask visit clinic regular pre-scheduled checkup lab assessment . During Cycle 1 study , patient ask come clinic twice assessment , Day 1 Day 15 . At visit study staff talk patient study great detail , perform study visit procedure provide study treatment . The staff may also perform test evaluation need . If subject continue qualify study Cycle 1 , undergo medical review , physical exam blood sample Day 1 cycle . Throughout study , patient ask experience side effect . Subjects responsible keep doctor inform feel reaction study treatment . In addition , subject responsible take medication daily basis direct . It important inform treat clinician miss dos reason dos miss , study visit . Patients also responsible return unused medication empty bottle study visit . On Day 1 Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 every third cycle long patient remain study blood sample CTC test ( 2 tablespoon ) collect . The following additional procedure do Day 1 Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 every third cycle thereafter , Treatment Discontinuation : CT MRI abdomen pelvis bone scan . After final dose study drug , patient return End Study Treatment Visit ( 15-28 day treatment discontinuation ) . The test complete end study visit Cycle 1 Day 1 .</detailed_description>
