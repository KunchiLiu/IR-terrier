	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call cabozantinib possible treatment acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I trials test safety investigational drug combination drug . Phase I study also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . This mean FDA approve give cabozantinib use patient , include patient type cancer . The study drug cabozantinib work inhibit several different protein believe involved growth multiplication cancerous cell associate acute myeloid leukemia . This drug use research study information research study suggest drug may help prevent cancer growth . The primary purpose research study determine high dose Cabozantinib safely give without severe unmanageable side effect . The dose identify study use future research study seek determine role cabozantinib treatment AML .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question participant 's past present treatment , health history , current medication , blood transfusion , allergy participant , may . - Physical exam perform include measurement follow : weight height , vital sign ( blood pressure , heart breathing rate , oral temperature. ) . - Performance status , evaluate participant able carry usual activity . - Pregnancy test participant woman able child . This do urine blood . - Urine test sample urine take check abnormal cell sign infection . - Thyroid test blood test ass normal function participant 's thyroid gland - Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) : lead apply participant 's chest record heart beat rhythm . - Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) MUGA scan heart : An echocardiogram ultrasound see participant 's heart functioning . A MUGA also ultrasound see heart function . For MUGA , radioactive substance inject participant 's vein picture heart create use special camera . - Blood test : approximately 3-4 teaspoon blood drawn measure participant 's disease level determine organ work well enough allow safely participate study . - Bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy : needle insert participant 's hip breast bone order remove small amount bone marrow cell . Samples also collect research purpose . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin study treatment . If participant meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . Additional research procedure perform time screening : - Blood test : approximately 4 teaspoon blood take research purpose . Research sample take compare later study discover cabozantinib work fight participant 's disease . - Bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy : Bone marrow aspirate sample , approximately 1 teaspoon , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy do prior screen take research . After screen procedure confirm participant eligible participate research study : Study Drug ( cabozantinib ) : If participant take part research study , participant give study drug diary study cycle . Each study cycle 28 day ( 4 week ) . Cabozantinib come form tablet participant take mouth day . Detailed instruction take cabozantinib find study drug diary . Research Study Plan : Tests Procedures : The participant come clinic Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 28 cycle 1 , day 1 , 8 , 15 , 28 cycle 2 , day 1 15 every subsequent cycle . Visits clinic may frequent determine study doctor . The participant follow test procedures visit : Assessments complete trial : - Physical exam - Performance status - Urine test - Blood test : Both routine research sample draw throughout study . Bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy : A bone marrow aspirate/biopsy complete day 28 cycle 1 cabozantinib . A bone marrow biopsy may also do participant 's cancer appear get good , approximately day 42 start therapy . A bone marrow biopsy/aspirate may also perform disease returns/relapses time study assess disease response . The bone marrow aspirate/biopsy study perform participant withdrawn study , or/and participant receive treatment disease . Bone marrow aspirate sample , approximately one teaspoon , also obtain research time point . Please note blood sample research purpose also draw day participant 's bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . Approximately two teaspoon blood drawn .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults , 18 year age old , pathologically confirm , relapse refractory acute myelogenous leukemia OR 70 old candidate , decline , conventional front line chemotherapy . White blood cell count ( WBC ) low 30,000/mm3 prior initiation cabozantinib ( Patients otherwise medically eligible enrollment WBC 30,000/mm3 allow concurrent treatment hydroxyurea and/or 6mercaptopurine stabilize WBC 15 day therapy . In situation , hydroxyurea and/or 6mercaptopurine discontinue WBC 10,000/mm3 ) The subject laboratory value follow within 7 day prior enrollment : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . For subject know Gilbert 's disease , bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL Serum albumin ≥ 2.8 g/dl Serum creatinine ≤1.5 × ULN creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 50 mL/min . For creatinine clearance estimation , Cockcroft Gault equation use : Male : CrCl ( mL/min ) = ( 140 age ) × wt ( kg ) / ( serum creatinine × 72 ) Female : Multiply result 0.85 Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3.0 × ULN Lipase &lt; 2.0 x upper limit normal radiologic clinical evidence pancreatitis Urine protein/creatinine ratio ( UPCR ) ≤ 1 Serum phosphorus &gt; 2.5 , calcium &gt; 8.4 , magnesium &gt; 1.3 , potassium &gt; 3.3 . Electrolyte repletion allow reach value . ECOG performance status 01 . LVEF must equal great 50 % , measure MUGA scan echocardiogram Patients , appropriate designee , must able provide inform consent . Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g. , male female condom ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) , even oral contraceptive also use . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month .
