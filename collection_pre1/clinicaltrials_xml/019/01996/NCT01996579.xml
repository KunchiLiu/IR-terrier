	<brief_summary>Lactoferrin protein component immune system . It many property could make ideal agent prevention hospital-acquired infection . Lactoferrin antibacterial property ( able kill stop growth disease cause bacteria fungal organism ) , improve immune function , increase growth beneficial bacteria bowel . Lactoferrin approve Health Canada Natural Health product sell health food store supplement . However , give potential beneficial effect Lactoferrin , require study effect acutely seriously ill patient . One potential use study prevention infection critically adult ill patient . The aim study determine utility Lactoferrin patient population . The Lactoferrin investigator use study extract cow 's milk , naturally occur . Cow lactoferrin similar property normally produce human body . This study conduct determine well solution Lactoferrin give orally feed tube help prevent infection inflammation critically ill patient addition usual care measure know partially effective prevention infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Nosocomial Infections Critically Ill Patients With Lactoferrin : The PREVAIL Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis/Objectives Nosocomial infection common critically ill , mechanically ventilated patient remain source morbidity mortality vulnerable patient population . Multiple potential etiology increase susceptibility nosocomial infection posit include instrumentation monitoring treatment , alteration immunological function , replacement normal gastro-intestinal ( GI ) flora pathogen increase permeability bowel mucosa . Current preventive measure partially effective study efficacious preventive measure nosocomial infection selective decontamination digestive tract ( SDD ) antimicrobial therapy although rarely used secondary concern development antimicrobial resistance . There need study utilize novel measure SDD maintain benefit SDD minimize negative consequence increase antibiotic use drive antimicrobial resistance . Lactoferrin , molecule part innate immune system many property would make ideal agent prevention nosocomial infection . It maintain GI integrity , antibacterial property , improve immune function , beneficial effect bacterial flora GI tract . As result , overall hypotheses objective research program follow : OVERALL HYPOTHESIS : The administration oral nasogastric Lactoferrin critically ill mechanically ventilated patient reduce nosocomial infection , reduce antibiotic usage , result improve outcome improve survival . HYPOTHESIS PHASE 2 Study : A Phase 2 randomize control trial determine effectiveness Lactoferrin prevention nosocomial infection demonstrate utilization Lactoferrin result increase antibiotic free day support biomarker mechanistic data obtain . OBJECTIVES : 1 . Objective 1 : The primary objective Phase 2 , multicenter , randomize control trial ( RCT ) determine effect Lactoferrin antibiotic free day . These data inform future large scale Phase 3 RCT power clinically important outcome mortality . 2 . Objective 2 : The second objective ass feasibility conduct future large scale Phase 3 RCT power clinically important outcome . 3 . Objective 3 : To obtain information effect Lactoferrin clinical outcome include antibiotic utilization , nosocomial infection , length stay , measure organ dysfunction mortality . This study power detection clinically important difference inform power calculation definitive Phase 3 trial . 4 . Objective 4 : To determine effect treatment Lactoferrin inflammatory biomarkers , immunological function , gastro-intestinal integrity tracheal colonization .</detailed_description>
