	<brief_summary>Pneumococcus bacteria cause disease respiratory tract ( pneumonia middle ear infection ) , blood poisoning , meningitis . It frequently carry people back throat without symptom . Pneumococcal carriage Thames Valley region study last 12 year carriage rate show reflective disease potential hence vaccine effect . During time pneumococcal vaccine introduce routine immunisation schedule community . The PCV7 ( A vaccine 7 type pneumococcus ) vaccine subsequently note significant impact reduce vaccine serotype carriage disease . Herd protection ( indirect protection unvaccinated individual ) also implicate vaccine serotypes carry parent vaccinated child . The common serotype carry since introduction PCV7 19A , include PCV13 vaccine ( A vaccine 13 type pneumococcus ) .
