	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy HER2 Positive Breast Cancer , TRAIN-2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upfront trastuzumab treatment beneficial patient HER2 positive breast cancer . The potential synergistic cardiotoxicity trastuzumab anthracyclines lead development non-anthracycline containing regimen , show high pathologic complete response rate . Anthracyclines remain active HER2 positive breast cancer , however , increase evidence support safe combination trastuzumab epirubicin . Therefore , addition epirubicin non-anthracycline contain regimen may improve outcome patient HER2 positive breast cancer . Several report confirm benefit dual HER2 blockade add pertuzumab trastuzumab contain neoadjuvant regimen . The result combine treatment Neosphere study , however , similar find phase II trial use weekly paclitaxel , trastuzumab , carboplatin combination pCR rate approximately 44 % . Adding pertuzumab regimen likely also increase high pCR rate add substantial benefit patient .</detailed_description>
