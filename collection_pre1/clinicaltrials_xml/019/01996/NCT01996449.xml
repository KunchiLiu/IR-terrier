	<brief_summary>Hypertensive patient often show exaggerated rise blood pressure exercise overactivity exercise pressor reflex . An increase body evidence suggest role aldosterone augment exercise pressor reflex hypertensive human . We hypothesize effect aldosterone mediate direct action central nervous system administration mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist constitute effective treatment EPR overactivity hypertension , independent reduction rest BP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Aldosterone Augmented Exercise Pressor Reflex Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertensive patient know display exaggerate rise blood pressure ( BP ) exercise underlie mechanism poorly understood . Traditionally , muscle afferent dichotomized metaboreceptors , activate slowly intense ischemic muscle contraction , mechanoreceptors , respond quickly even mild deformation receptive field . The increase sympathetic nerve activity BP cause activation receptor , know exercise pressor reflex , normally buffer activation arterial baroreceptor , reset operate high BP range level sensitivity . Mechanisms responsible overactive exercise pressor reflex hypertension remain unknown , increase body evidence suggest role aldosterone regulate rest central sympathetic outflow hypertensive rat human . Experiments perform 3 group subject 1 ) stage I ( 140-159/90-99 mmHg ) subject essential hypertension , 2 ) stage I hypertensive subject Primary Aldosteronism ( PA ) , 3 ) normotensive control . All participant attend baseline study visit , include physical examination , medical history review , vital sign measurement , blood urine collection . Small electrode used measure muscle nerve activity subject perform series exercise include passive arm cycling , active arm cycling , rhythmic hand grip , sustain hand grip cold pressor test . Muscle blood flow measure hand grip exercise . A subgroup subject essential hypertension PA assign receive Eplerenone Amlodipine randomize , double-blinded design . Participants attend two week visit period 16 week . Study visit include measurement vital sign blood sample collection . After complete 8 week medication , muscle nerve activity measure performing exercise describe baseline study visit .</detailed_description>
