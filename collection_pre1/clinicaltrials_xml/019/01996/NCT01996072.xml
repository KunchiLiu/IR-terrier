	<brief_summary>Primary hyperparathyroidism significant medical public health problem world affect approximately 100,000 new patient United States alone . If leave untreated lead renal stone , osteoporosis , fatigue , depression . The best treatment primary hyperparathyroidism surgical parathyroidectomy . However surgical parathyroidectomy difficult due variant location parathyroid gland . Up 5 % patient leave operate room without surgical cure . Primary hyperparathyroidism ideal disease investigate intraoperative fluorescent imaging . This would allow surgeon identify parathyroid gland resect suspicious parathyroid gland . Folate receptor ( FR ) find over-expressed parathyroid tissue thyroid issue . An ideal surgical treatment would combine FR-specific fluorescent tracer intraoperative imaging . It important note FR express proximal tubule kidney , activate macrophage , choroidal plexus . Thus , false positive detection rate expect extremely low . A group well know u Netherlands complete pilot study utilize folate-FITC conjugate 12 patient ovarian cancer . Another group investigator Mayo subsequently perform study 20 patient without serious adverse event ( personal communication ) . They report excellent sensitivity specificity technique grade 1 side effect ( allergic reaction ) . All side effect reverse injection halt . Patients history allergic reaction insect bite participate ( fluorescein derive firefly insect , folate essential vitamin ) . A fluorescent contrast agent ( folate-FITC EC17 ) use determine localize primary tumor nodule ( ) mass ( es ) patient undergo parathyroid surgery .</brief_summary>
