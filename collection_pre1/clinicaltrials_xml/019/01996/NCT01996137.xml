	<brief_summary>An exploratory clinical study Variable Speed Sensing Treadmill system ( VASST ) hemiparetic gait rehabilitation stroke . Building upon positive result VASST I conduct 2012 , VASST II open label pilot trial 11 subject screen eligibility TTSH medical rehabilitation team Study hypotheses : Training VASST may result gain +40 % - 50 % distance walk +10-20 % gait speed compare baseline response rate 85 % serious adverse event rate &lt; 10 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VASSTII : An Exploratory Clinical Study VASST IITreadmill System Post Stroke Gait Rehabilitation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A recent collaboration Ngee Ann Polytechnic 's team Biomedical Engineering Centre , Electronic &amp; Computer Engineering Division , School Of Engineering Singapore yield VASST I ; innovative product , result co development NP TTSH rehabilitation centre 's CART ( Centre Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics ) support competitive grant . ( EMBC paper ref , SIRF ) VASST I incorporate follow feature enhance manual treadmill training : 1 . Sensing mechanisms track user 's self-activated action exercise . 2 . Automated speed‚Äêcontrol adapt user 's gait speed pattern . 3 . Safety sense slow treadmill user unable sustain treadmill speed order avert potential fall . 4 . Overhead safety harness without body weight support reduction fall risk . 5 . Software tool collect vital clinical data regard ambulatory gait speed , distance time walk treatment . A recently complete proof concept trial June 2013 yield encouraging result 10 chronic poststroke hemiplegic subject . All subject complete trial without adverse event . The clinical team able smoothly test-bed VASST 10 subject good subjective feedback . Following 12 hour - long supervise training session 4 week , significant gain baseline measure gait quantity ( +30.1 % ) gait speed ( +8.7 % ) . These gain maintain 4 week train cease . The response rate 80 % positive feedback obtain 80 % subject . Objective measurement obtain use independent kinematic gait analysis use Gaitrite system . With encouraging result , combine TTSH Ngee Ann medical bioengineering team bring co-development deep level , lead VASST II conceptualize pre-commercialisation prototype . Additional technological improvement include : 1 . Automated unweighting subsystem 20 % body weight support benefit severely impaired subject term reduction physical fatigue ambulation reduce destabilization fall risk high gait training speed . 2 . Hand grip sensor intelligently guide progression training speed 3 . Instrumentation subsystem include sensor record spatial temporal gait measurement gait train step stride length , gait speed / distance walk . An anticipated sensor accuracy +/- 1.27 cm similar Gaitrite system measure step length may potentially allow ambulatory gait monitoring , obviate need additional independent post-training analysis use gait measurement instrument Gaitrite . 4 . Real-time feedback subsystem graphical LCD display interactive vary order reduce boredom motivate user . 5 . Wireless data transfer subsystem data storage analysis laptop computer treat therapist . Research objectives 1 . To provide clinical input VASST II via systematic hazard analysis , order arrive prototype may attract commercial interest licensing manufacture eventual deployment ambulatory rehabilitation clinic hospital day rehabilitation centre . 2 . To conduct pilot clinical trial use VASST II 11 subacute chronic ( &gt; 3 month ) hemiplegic stroke patient ambulatory set . 3 . To obtain pre post outcome use standardized clinical scale objective measurement gait parameter exercise . ( gait speed , quantity , cadence , step length ) 4 . To obtain subjective feedback regard experience use VASST II research subject therapist .</detailed_description>
