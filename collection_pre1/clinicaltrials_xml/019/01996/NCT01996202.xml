	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Willing able give write informed consent . 2 . Histologic diagnosis melanoma 3 . Cohort 1 : Resected patient high risk recurrence . Patients must meet least one follow criterion a. Melanoma mucosal origin b. Desmoplastic melanoma c. Primary melanoma head neck lymph node involvement d. Patients nonhead neck primary must preoperative/pathologic macroscopic lymph node involvement , define clinically evident exam image evaluation , plus least one follow clinical , image , pathologic evaluation : . ≥ 2 cervical axillary node ii . ≥ 3 groin lymph node iii . Extracapsular extension ( ECE ) tumor iv . Lymph nod ≥ 3cm 4 . Cohort 2 : Neoadjuvant/definitive approach locally advanced patient . Patients must meet least one follow criterion 1 . Melanoma mucosal origin 2 . Desmoplastic melanoma 3 . Patients radiographic evidence tumor invasion surround local structure render inoperable 4 . Macroscopic nodal involvement . In addition , patient must also meet one follow criterion i. Recurrent disease , number size node ii . ≥ 1 parotid node ( ) iii . ≥ 2 cervical axillary node iv . ≥ 3 groin lymph node v. Lymph node ≥ 3cm vi . ECE tumor 5 . Resected patient begin treatment within 12 week surgery , adequately heal determined treating physician . 6 . Localregional treatment site must able encompass within reasonable radiation therapy treatment volume 7 . Patients recurrent disease allow cohort 1 , provide least one criterion list 3 meet 8 . For patient new diagnosis melanoma treat cohort 2 cutaneous primary , primary site may address surgically ( wide local excision ; skin graft ) prior initiation ipilimumab radiation discretion treat surgeon . 9 . Required value initial laboratory test : WBC ≥ 2000/uL ANC ≥ 1000/uL Platelets ≥ 75 x 103/uL Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( ≥ 80 g/L ; may transfuse ) Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x ULN AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN , ( except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dL ) 10 .

Postmenopause define : Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause , For woman irregular menstrual period take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level ≥ 35 mIU/mL . Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour start ipilimumab . Men father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study [ 26 week last dose investigational product ] manner risk pregnancy minimize . 14 . Patients must agree blood sample participate study . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Ocular melanoma 2 . Presence brain metastases 3 . Prior radiation therapy melanoma 4 . Any malignancy form patient diseasefree less 3 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , DCIS . Patients prior malignancy consider active problem may enrol discretion investigator , regardless time frame . 5 . Autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's Disease , exclude study , patient history symptomatic disease ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ eg , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g . GuillainBarre Syndrome Myasthenia Gravis ) . 6 . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator make administration ipilimumab hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea . 7 . Any nononcology vaccine therapy use prevention infectious disease ( 1 month dose ipilimumab ) . 8 . A history prior treatment ipilimumab prior CD137 agonist CTLA 4 inhibitor agonist . 9 . Concomitant therapy following : IL 2 , interferon , nonstudy immunotherapy regimen ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigation therapy ; chronic use systemic corticosteroid previous 4 week ( define prednisone 10mg daily equivalent . ) 10 .

Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious ) illness . 12 . Persons reproductive potential must agree use adequate method contraception throughout treatment least 26 week ipilimumab stop . Sexually active WOCBP must use effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Before study enrollment , WOCBP must advise importance avoid pregnancy study participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test first receive ipilimumab . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive ipilimumab must enrol study .</criteria>
