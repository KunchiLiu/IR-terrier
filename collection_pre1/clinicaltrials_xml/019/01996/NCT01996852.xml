	<detailed_description>Erectile dysfunction ( ED ) common side effect prostate cancer treatment . Existing medical treatment focus early penile rehabilitation , aim prevent penile shrinkage preserve nerve smooth muscle facilitate erection return . It typically include administration phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor ( PDE-5 ) , application vacuum constriction device ( VCD ) intracavernous injection immediately prostate cancer treatment . To evaluate propose intervention , randomize , control longitudinal clinical trial conduct examine effect cognitive-behavioral intervention early-stage prostate cancer patient ED partner . The propose study include pilot study , randomize clinical trial ( main study ) data analysis . The study duration main study participant 10 month include one month recruitment baseline assessment , six month intervention , three month follow-up . The study duration pilot study participant 7 month include one month recruitment baseline assessment plus six month intervention . The Pilot Study A pilot study conduct develop test propose study intervention 12 month . The pilot study recruit 36 early-stage prostate cancer patient partner . The 36 couple randomly assign three study arm : ( 1 ) standard medical treatment ED ( MED ) ; ( 2 ) standard medical treatment ED plus cognitive-behavioral intervention ( MED+CBI ) ; ( 3 ) usual care ( UC ) study participant receive study intervention , continue standard care allow patient 's request ED treatment . The purpose include usual care group collect preliminary data aid estimation intervention effect size , statistic power sample size , compare intervention outcome real world scenario order provide justification inclusion exclusion usual care arm main study . The pilot study participant assess twice baseline ( T1 ) 7 month ( T2 ) . Doppler Ultrasound penis perform T1 T2 examine change volume penile blood flow patient . Subjects allow opt Doppler Ultrasound test , pilot data exploratory five ultrasound test per group sufficient . Collecting analyze blood sample perform T1 T2 subject allow opt test well . The blood sample collect order test transform growth factor beta-1 ( TGF-ß1 ) ass relation erectile function . The result allow u evaluate intervention impact molecular level formulate best possible intervention ED . The Main Study During 4-year clinical trial study , 144 early-stage prostate cancer patient along partner randomly assign two study arm : ( 1 ) standard medical treatment ED ( MED ) ( 2 ) standard medical treatment ED plus cognitive-behavioral intervention ( MED+CBI ) . The MED include administration sildenafil citrate ( Viagra ) and/or vacuum constriction device ( pump ) . The MED+CBI entail six in-person session five telephone follow-ups six month . The patient assess erectile function ( EF ) , quality life ( QOL ) mood baseline ( T1 ) , 7 month ( T2 ) 10 month ( T3 ) . The partner assess QOL mood T1 , T2 T3 . Doppler Ultrasound penis perform T1 T2 examine change volume penile blood flow among 50 patient consecutively select two study group , 25 per study arm . The long-term primary goal study : 1 . Assess effect new treatment erection function , quality life , mood . 2 . Assess treatment compliance frequency sexual activity new treatment . 3 . Investigate mechanism new treatment work . The long-term secondary goal study : 1 . Assess effect new treatment quality life mood patient 's partner . 2 . Assess change volume penile blood flow due study treatment .</detailed_description>
