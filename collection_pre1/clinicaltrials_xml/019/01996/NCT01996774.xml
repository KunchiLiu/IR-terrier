	<brief_summary>Many author propose strict avoidance allergenic food treatment child know allergic certain food . However , observed increase frequency severity allergic accident child long term . Other team suggest treat allergy ( particular peanut allergy ) control progressive reintroduction allergenic food . A good tolerance prevention allergic reaction consecutive ingestion allergenic food observe . The immunological mechanism type treatment well know . A decrease specific IgE increase IgG4 observe case egg allergy kind treatment . Certain experiment realize mouse model test allergenic stimulation challenge show increase lymphocyte T regulator ( foxp3+ , CD4+ , CD25+ ) , stimulate dendritic cell , also increase interleukin 10 , lead modification balance Th1 Th2.Our hypothesis treat allergy reintroduction allergenic food , immunological mechanism acquisition tolerance associate variation population lymphocytes activation decrease pro anti-inflammatory cytokine . This reaction study two group : 1 . Children confirm allergy peanut nuts 2 . Children without antecedent allergy familiar atopy .</brief_summary>
