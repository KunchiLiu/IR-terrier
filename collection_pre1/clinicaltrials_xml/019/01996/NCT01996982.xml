	<detailed_description>Introduction : The ability manipulate body core temperature quickly effectively would impact number field , truly transformative potential . By far best way effect change body temperature perfusion cool warm blood vasculature human body equilibrate magnificently well body especially body core tissue due diffuse microcirculation . This process quite invasive , however , noninvasive technique date mostly revolve around various surface heat transfer mechanisms ultimately rely relatively inferior conduction heat transfer . Grahn , et al. , Stanford University identify new technique increase rate heat transfer skin body core factor ten harness convective power circulatory system completely noninvasive way [ 1 , 2 ] . Our system derivative Stanford device , different many significant way . A well-understood thus modifiable system capable rapid artificial heat transfer almost limitless potential application , include treatment acute brain trauma ( single great challenge treatment induce immediate hypothermia ) , athletic performance enhancement , military operation , enhancement industry worker subject extreme thermal stress . Description Technology/Device : The technology work two-step process , consist first stimulating blood flow AVAs second cool glabrous skin blood flow . Accordingly , device consist two component : first blood flow stimulation source , second surface heat exchanger chill glabrous skin thereby blood flow subsequently flow back body core , cool tissue . Two separate mean stimulation test trial : - Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) - An FDA-approved TENS unit send current via surface electrode skin stimulate nerve control state AVA vasoconstriction . This stimulation create vasodilation effect AVAs , allow increase blood flow . - Mild thermal stimulation along skin overlie cervical spine send control signal vasodilate AVAs provide increase blood flow glabrous skin . An FDA-approved electric heating pad use purpose temperature 42°C low . Cooling accomplished apply water perfusion bladder hand foot . The water recirculate bladder hold tank internal pump , thermoelectric cooler regulate water temperature . The water temperature 20°C high . Research Incentive : The AVA structure glabrous ( non-hairy ) skin one component body 's natural thermoregulatory system . The anatomy morphology AVAs describe great extent literature , e.g . Sherman [ 6 ] . Putative pre-AVA sphincter think primary controller perfusion AVAs , regardless level AVA vasodilation . If AVAs completely dilate , sphincter close , blood pool dilate AVAs , flow blood , essential heat exchange core , minimal . In contrast perfusion capillary , largely regulated local condition , flow AVAs appear mostly centrally mediate , control primarily vasoconstrictor tone impart rich sympathetic innervation [ 7-10 ] . The sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone , appear oscillate characteristic manner time , controlled central nervous system 's homeostatic center respond various centrally locate core temperature receptor . The complete inner working control system effector mechanism completely understood quantified , factor influence AVA blood flow degree , local skin temperature , presence vasoactive metabolite , level exercise , stimulation various peripheral thermal site . Recent work Diller lab indicate potential inherent latter . The lab identify region skin may non-energetically thermally stimulate ( heat small area warm significant volume ) induce AVA vasodilation . We hypothesize site contain important thermoafferent sensor impact central component ( hypothalamic ) govern controller . The ability induce mild hypothermia normothermic state represent application great interest research group . If optimally develop , device capable induce 2-4°C decrease body core temperature could huge impact treatment various medical disease state and/or emergency , include cardiac arrest , severe brain injury , stroke . It well know tissue death due traumatic physical injury and/or ischemia decrease therapeutic hypothermia temperature dependence cellular metabolism complex , destructive biochemical process occur damage tissue [ 12 ] . Therapeutic hypothermia show great effect various animal model ; however , translation result clinical domain difficult . Aside possible interspecies physiological difference , researcher able produce injury cool core research animal control manner , importantly , cool induced soon injury . From experiment , suggest `` window opportunity '' exist 90 minute post injury , little therapeutic effect occur mild hypothermia . Moreover , 90-minute threshold may stretch , cool within 60-minute window may appropriate . Clinically , cool within former surely latter windows almost never achieve . There number reason : time injury mobilization patient , transportation emergency care facility , initial assessment patient hospital setting , importantly physiological science , lack fast effective method cool body core . Due simple size geometry , human body much difficult heat cool , example , rat model . This especially true conductive heat transfer mechanism ( current noninvasive therapeutic hypothermia implementation base ) relatively small ratio surface area thermal mass volume [ 3 ] . We hope problem rapid core temperature manipulation drastically improve upon , specifically utilize convective heat transfer AVAs glabrous skin . In experiment , believe optimize combinatorial protocol utilize large coverage glabrous region ( palms plus soles foot ) , manipulation mean skin temperature , especially optimized stimulation peripheral thermoafferent sensor locate region body along spine , allow mild hypothermia induction spite conflict thermoregulatory controller . We especially hope manipulation important thermoafferents allow u `` trick '' controller bypass effective vasoconstrictive signal .</detailed_description>
