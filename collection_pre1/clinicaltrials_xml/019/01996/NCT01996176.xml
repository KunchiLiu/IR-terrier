Intervention : The intervention consist four part : Information , local adaption , structural change individual support . 2 . Control : The control group receive intervention last follow-up ( 3 month later ) . Methods : Data sedentary behaviour collect objectively use ActiGraph . Waist circumference body fat percentage measure . Questionnaire data collect background variable , physical activity level , workplace condition well-being . Data collect baseline , 1 3 month . Analysis carry follow intention-to-treat principle compare intervention control group . We use several outcome include baseline value covariate ( ANCOVA ) . In addition use multilevel model account hierarchical structure data ( workplace , cluster participant ) . Process evaluation conduct use qualitative interview questionnaire data concern adoption , implementation sustainability intervention .</detailed_description>
