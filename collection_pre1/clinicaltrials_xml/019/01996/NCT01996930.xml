	<brief_summary>Kidney failure devastate illness require treatment dialysis transplantation preserve life . Individuals unable transplant manage peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) haemodialysis ( HD ) . PD involve placement soft , flexible plastic tube ( catheter ) abdomen , allow dialysis fluid drain peritoneal cavity . This catheter exit hole abdomen occasionally patient complication exit site . One possible complication over-granulation . Over-granulation occur wound attempt heal skin around exit site becomes red , 'wet ' , 'bumpy ' stand 'proud ' surround skin . An over-granulating exit site lead discomfort , pain , bleed harbour infection . More serious complication include dialysis failure , sepsis death . There several way treat over-granulation limited research evidence demonstrate treatment best . The study aim compare current standard treatment involve application silver nitrate qualify nursing staff chemically burn tissue away , alternative treatment involve application steroid impregnated tape area over-granulating tissue patient .</brief_summary>
