	<brief_title>Icotinib Following Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Adjuvant Therapy Stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC With EGFR Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjuvant chemotherapy recommend routine use patient fully resect stage IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKIs ) show great efficacy patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) EGFR mutation . Icotinib novel EGFR-TKI develop group Chinese scientist . In phase III ICOGEN trial , icotinib non-inferiority efficacy gefitinib well safety . In phase II trial , chemotherapy follow 6-month gefitinib adjuvant therapy confer longer disease-free survival compare chemotherapy alone patient resected stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer harbor EGFR mutation . This study study 6-month 12-month icotinib follow chemotherapy see well work compare chemotherapy treat patient resect stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC harbor EGFR mutation .</detailed_description>
