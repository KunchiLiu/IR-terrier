	<detailed_description>Asthma , inflammatory disease airway mucosa , highly correlate obesity nutritional intake multiple cross-sectional study . Limited interventional data adult asthma , rely behavioral modification , report asthma control significantly improve caloric restriction diet enrich antioxidant , may improve increase omega-3 fatty acid content . A comprehensive diet harness anti-inflammatory property multiple food may synergistic effect bronchial inflammation pulmonary function , yet possibility remain largely untested , especially child . We propose randomize , control cross-over trial , 6-week treatment arm , pediatric patient moderate severe asthma . The experimental diet focus reduce glycemic load , increase fiber , fruit , vegetable , legumes food-based omega-3 fatty acid content . The comparison diet participant 's habitual diet . Both diet isocaloric weight maintaining , isolate effect dietary composition know beneficial effect weight loss . In addition , home delivery prepared meal alleviate variable incomplete adherence commonly observe behavioral study .</detailed_description>
