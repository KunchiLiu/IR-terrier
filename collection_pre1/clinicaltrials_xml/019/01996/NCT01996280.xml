	<brief_title>A Randomized Clinical Trial Culturally Tailored MI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose R01 research , response PA 10-100 , `` Alcohol Use Disorders : Treatment , Services Research , Recovery '' , address PA priority : Treatment Health Disparities/Special Populations . Latinos , large fast grow ethnic group United States ( U.S. ) , represent 14 % population ( 1 ) , expect grow nearly 29 % population 2050 ( 2-3 ) . Like many immigrant group adapt U.S. culture , Latinos adopt health behavior mainstream population , hazardous drinking ( 4-6 ) . Hazardous drinking pattern drinking associate increase alcohol relate problem : injury , violence , sexually transmit disease ( 7-15 ) , increase risk develop alcohol use disorder ( abuse dependence ) ( 7 , 10 , 16 ) . Latinos report disproportionately great burden illness , injury , workplace legal problem ( 17-21 ) result alcohol consumption racial ethnic group , include elevate risk alcohol-involved motor vehicle crash fatality ( 20 , 22 ) . Early intervention prevents need costly complex alcohol treatment ( 23 ) . According National Academy Sciences , dissemination empirically-based intervention culturally tailor particularly need among Latinos ( 23-24 ) suffer alcohol-related health disparity ( 18-20 , 25-26 ) alcohol treatment utilization rate lower among Latinos among minority racial/ethnic group Whites ( 27-29 ) . Although evidence suggest culturally tailor addiction treatment improve retention treatment outcome ( 30-31 ) , progress field limit lack prospective clinical trial compare tailored non-tailored treatment ( 23 ) . The PI 's ( New Investigator ) fund K award ( AA014905 ) provide important pilot data demonstrate culturally tailor motivational interviewing ( CTMI ) outperform un-tailored motivational interviewing ( MI ) . This study basis current propose study , large scale version pilot . The culturally tailor MI maintain MI component . The key modification Social Contextual Model Cultural Tailoring tailor MI incorporate important acculturation stressor ( 32-33 ) : limited financial resource opportunity , loss social network , discrimination ( 34-38 ) , change cultural value . The propose study investigate acculturation stress ( 39 ) influence relationship acculturation alcohol consumption behavior treatment outcome . Efforts help build comprehensive model acculturation stressor influence drink behavior among Latinos ( 40 ) . The CTMI also need effort tailor treatment drinker experience burden multiple social contextual source disadvantage , include poverty , discrimination , acculturation stress ( 40 ) . Because original pilot study goal isolate test effect tailor treatment , deliver English . The current proposal extend tailored treatment Spanish-speaking Latinos . Providing tailored treatment Spanish address major clinical need increase external generalizability . The study 's public health impact provide early screening brief intervention reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos community lack service . By provide early screening intervention , hope minimize burden illness social consequence disproportionately affect Latino community . Impact field : contribute understand whether culturally tailor motivational intervention enhances treatment efficacy Latinos compare un-tailored treatment . Another contribution explore effect translate tailor MI . Short term goal compare efficacy evidenced-based treatment , MI , culturally adapt version MI among Latinos . Long term goal disseminate easily trainable , conceptual model culturally tailor empirically-based substance abuse treatment , understand acculturation process confer risk increase hazardous drinking among Latinos , inform tailoring treatment multiple stressor , include acculturation stress . Research Hypotheses : Primary Aim 1 : Treatment Main Effect . Determine efficacy standard motivational interviewing ( MI ) compare culturally tailor MI ( CTMI ) two , six , twelve month follow-up . We hypothesize CTMI participant report few alcohol-related negative consequence few heavy drinking day follow-up vs. MI participant . Primary Aim 2 : Explore acculturation stress moderator alcohol treatment outcomes Latinos . We hypothesize among participant high acculturation stress , CTMI improve time MI ( 6 month ) . We also hypothesize among receive CTMI , high acculturation stress may show great improvement time ( six month ) low acculturation stress .</detailed_description>
