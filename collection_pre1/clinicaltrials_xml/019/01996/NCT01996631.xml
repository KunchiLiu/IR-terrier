	<brief_summary>Oxidative stress ( OS ) , inflammation , endocrine-disrupting chemical ( EDC ) think important marker impact female reproductive function . However , cause-result correlation parameter still unclear . Investigator plan design study evaluate OS , inflammation , EDC impact menstrual cycle reproductive hormone Taiwanese woman . Ferritin ubiquitous intracellular protein essential regulation iron homeostasis . Serum ferritin level widely available clinical biomarker use estimate body iron status . Iron strong pro-oxidant , high body iron level associate increase level OS may elevate risk type 2 diabetes . Mildly elevate body iron store associate statistically significant elevation glucose homeostasis index . Furthermore , patient elevate iron store present insulin resistance also metabolic alteration put increase risk cardiovascular disease . Increased serum ferritin level find woman Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS ) . Serum ferritin highly correlate menstrual cycle androgen level woman . Homocysteine , sulfur-containing amino acid form metabolism methionine , exert cytotoxic effect vascular endothelium . Hyperhomocysteinemia establish independent risk factor thrombosis cardiovascular disease , may partially account increased risk cardiovascular disease associate insulin resistance . Elevated total plasma homocysteine level establish independent risk factor thrombosis cardiovascular disease . Studies related homocysteine PCOS report inconsistent result . Chronic low-grade inflammation emerge key contributor pathogenesis PCOS obesity . A dietary trigger glucose capable incite OS inflammatory response mononuclear cell woman PCOS , phenomenon independent obesity . The correlation inflammatory marker reproductive endocrine disturbance consequent complication important.Both OS EDC associate PCOS . BPA , one EDC , environmental estrogen use synthesis plastic , `` high-volume production '' chemical widespread human exposure . BPA report several female reproductive disturbance . However , pathological pathway BPA impact female reproductive system well-understood . Reactive oxygen specie role modulation gamete quality gamete interaction . Persistent elevate generation ROS lead disturbance redox potential turn cause OS . The first part study aim evaluate OS impact biochemical parameter woman PCOS ; secondary part study investigate BPA clinical biochemical woman PCOS ; finally , investigator plan test hypothesis BPA might increase OS elevated ROS woman menstrual disturbance , furthermore , role OS BPA impact insulin resistance metabolic disturbance also investigate . OS , inflammation , EDCs important factor impact reproductive competence woman . To clarify problem critical importance . Investigator conduct study demonstrate problem . Study control case include . Serum total oxidant status , inflammatory biomarkers , total antioxidant status , BPA , clinical/biochemical parameter obtain case . OS BPA evaluate clinical/biochemical parameter subject .</brief_summary>
