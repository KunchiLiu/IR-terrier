	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate treatment-induced change quantitative MRI-based biomarkers—specifically , sensitive tumor protein content ( amide proton transfer asymmetry [ APTasym ] chemical exchange saturation transfer [ CEST ] ) , cellularity ( apparent diffusion coefficient [ ADC ] diffusion-weighted imaging [ DWI ] ) , blood flow ( volume transfer constant [ K^trans ] dynamic contrast-enhanced [ DCE ] ; cerebral blood flow [ CBF ] dynamic susceptibility contrast [ DSC ] ) —with treatment-induced change tumor size , measure via standard anatomic MRI . II . To correlate treatment-induced change quantitative MRI endpoint patient progression-free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo measurement tumor protein content use CEST-MRI , cellularity use DWI-MRI , blood flow use DCE-MRI DSC-MRI within 2 week treatment 2 4 week initiation treatment .</detailed_description>
