	<detailed_description>While use pessary scenario previously assess , reasonable infer , data use pessary prevent preterm birth , data regard efficacy cervical cerclage reduce bleed preterm birth patient placenta previa clinical conundrum . If cerclage improves pregnancy outcomes patient placenta previa , use vaginal pessary less-invasive similarly efficacious alternative maintain cervical length . The purpose study compare two treatment option reasonably use clinical practice . Use cervical pessary expect increase antenatal cost beyond minimal cost pessary . Additionally , give result available clinical trial cerclage maintain cervical length decrease bleeding , procedure potential decrease cost antepartum admission bleed neonatal care . A substantial number woman placenta previa hemorrhage reach third trimester , thus , allow enrollment pessary placement late 32w0d , intervention may apply broad `` risk '' population . As previously mention literature use cerclage patient placenta previa short cervix limit reduced number eligible subject concern safety issue assuage small study . As pessary placement appear carry little risk base number publish study , eligibility expand cervical length .</detailed_description>
