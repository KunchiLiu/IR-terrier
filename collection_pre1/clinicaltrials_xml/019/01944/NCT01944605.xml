	<brief_summary>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( CA ) lead public health problem cause nearly one third million death annually US , account half cardiovascular death surpass death stroke , heart failure , breast lung cancer combine . Twenty fifty percent CA patient ( pt ) resuscitate initially many die hospital discharge suffer permanent neurologic damage . Therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) improve survival neurological outcome . Despite aggressive , target post arrest management , include TH , approximately 50 % pt die leave hospital due global ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) know `` post arrest syndrome '' , 1 sepsis-like state characterize elevated marker cellular inflammation injury . It believe TH work decrease body 's basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) attenuate systemic inflammatory response ( SIR ) . However , specific trigger intense pro-inflammatory response unclear . This `` gap '' knowledge must close identify target therapy decrease IRI improve outcome . Blood flow gut decrease markedly intestinal tissue become ischemic CA CPR , particularly vasoconstrictor drug epinephrine , give . IRI intestine increase intestinal permeability lead intestinal microbial translocation endotoxin release stimulate perpetuate systemic inflammation cause subsequent multi-organ dysfunction . Endotoxin also increase body temperature energy expenditure may attenuate TH induced reduction BMR hence , decrease efficacy . The purpose novel pilot study detect systemic endotoxin release follow CA human determine association cytokine activation , BMR alteration TH .</brief_summary>
