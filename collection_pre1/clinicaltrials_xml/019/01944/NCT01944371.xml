	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , pharmacology bioactivity disulfiram antiretroviral treat HIV-infected adult . The investigator primary hypothesis 3 day disulfiram result increase HIV transcription CD4+ T-cells patient suppressive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Disulfiram Administration Reverse Latent HIV Infection : Dose Escalation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Combination antiretroviral therapy HIV-1 infection suppress viremia detection limit vast majority motivate individual access drug . However , HIV-1 persists small pool latently infect rest memory CD4+ T cell carry integrated viral genome . Although reservoirs HIV-1 exist , general consensus among expert latent virus ( HIV DNA rest memory CD4+ T cell ) primary barrier HIV-1 eradication . A widely discuss approach eliminate viral reservoir require reactivation latent HIV-1 . Disulfiram , FDA-approved drug use treat alcoholism show activate HIV-1 gene expression vitro , suggest activation latently infect cell vivo may occur . Our primary hypothesis addition disulfiram stable effective antiretroviral drug regimen result dose dependent increase HIV transcription CD4+ T-cells HIV-1 patient highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection Age 18 old HIV plasma viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml least 3 year least one measurement per year recent viral load within 3 month screen . Receiving combination antiretroviral therapy ( least 3 agent ) ; subject must efavirenzbased ritonavirbased regimen Two CD4+ T cell count great 350 cell/Âµl six month prior screen Willing abstain alcohol one day , three day period disulfiram administer two week period immediately disulfiram administration Current alcohol use disorder hazardous alcohol use Current use drug formulation contain alcohol might contain alcohol , include gelatin capsule liquid formulation ritonavir , ritonavir/lopinavir , amprenavir fosamprenavir . Current use tipranavir maraviroc . Current use zidovudine , stavudine didanosine ( disulfiram potentially potent irreversible inhibitory effect mitochondrial metabolism hence could exacerbate toxicity drug ) . Concurrent use rivaroxaban ( CYP3A metabolize medication ) cytochrome P450 inhibitory effect disulfiram rivaroxaban unknown . Current use warfarin Patients intend modify antiretroviral therapy next 2 week reason . Serious illness require hospitalization parental antibiotic within precede 3 month A screen hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL A screening TSH consistent Hypothyroidism Significant renal disease acute nephritis Significant myocardial disease diagnose coronary artery disease Significant respiratory disease History psychosis , seizure disorder , abnormal electroencephalogram brain damage significant persist neurological deficit . Clinically active hepatitis evidence clinical jaundice Grade 2 high liver function test abnormality . Hepatic cirrhosis decompensated chronic liver disease . Diabetes current hypothyroidism . Concurrent treatment immunomodulatory drug , exposure immunomodulatory drug past 16 week . Recent exposure ( within precede 8 week ) vaccine . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screen agree use doublebarrier method contraception throughout study period . Significant substance use , opinion investigator , likely interfere conduct study . Prior current use disulfiram , vorinostat experimental agent use intent perturb HIV1 viral reservoir Current use antiretroviral regimen include either efavirenz protease inhibitor</criteria>
