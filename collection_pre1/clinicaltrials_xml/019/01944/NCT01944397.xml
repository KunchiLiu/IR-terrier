	<brief_title>A CALIBER Study : Risk Factors Stroke , Heart Failure , Myocardial Infarction Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development stroke AF patient continue area substantial research focus . However , comparatively little research investigate extent HF MI also make substantial contribution morbidity mortality patient group , whether overlap prognostic factor associate development stroke , HF , MI . Conen et al . demonstrate mortality risk AF patient partly mediate development non-fatal stroke , HF , MI . However , investigate difference cumulative incidence condition different patient group ( e.g . men woman ) , relationship potential prognostic factor development condition . Sets prognostic factor stroke HF AF patient define development prognostic model , model develop specifically condition unclear whether prognostic factor associate increase risk particular condition , simply major adverse cardiovascular event . Additionally , potentially important prognostic factor evaluate study ( e.g . anaemia kidney failure ) . Thus chose conduct exploratory study prognostic factor HF , MI , stroke patient diagnosed AF . We select candidate factor previously associate stroke , HF , MI ( AF patient general population ) . Identification prognostic factor stroke , HF , MI diagnose AF first step toward understand development condition , scope target preventive treatment improve prognosis . This study undertaken use link electronic health record data primary secondary care CALIBER . This data set contains broad range clinically relevant , clinically conduct measurement potential prognostic factor , also provide large baseline sample draw sufficient number incident AF case investigate three endpoint . The study two aim . First , determine cumulative incidence fatal non-fatal heart failure ( HF ) , myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke ( ischaemic , haemorrhagic , NOS ) patient diagnose atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Differences clinically relevant group ( e.g . men woman ) explore . Second , compare direction magnitude association prognostic factor development condition ( HF , stroke , MI ) patient AF . The following panel prognostic factor investigate : sociodemographic ; anthropomorphic haemodynamic ; behavioural ; co-existing condition ( cardiovascular non-cardiovascular ) ; blood biomarkers ; secondary preventive drug . This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( GPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset ) .</detailed_description>
