	<detailed_description>Brain tumor lead cause death disability childhood disease develop country . With treatment advance last 25 year , survival rate improve dramatically . However , survival often achieve considerable cost . Cranial radiation frequently require effective tumor control , associate significant neuro-toxicity , include white matter damage cognitive morbidity . In order achieve best possible outcome survivor , ultimately conquer long-term consequence disease , new intervention must develop ameliorate neuro-toxic effect experience child . radiation injury use guide development intervention design rescue neural tissue . Furthermore , various new agent activity potential stimulate neuro-recovery available . The potential value exercise rescue brain neuro-toxic effect , instance , recently report . Next , neuro-cognitive process particularly sensitive effect cranial radiation identify serve behavioral assay test effectiveness new intervention . Finally , novel neuro-imaging tool available perform vivo evaluation order delineate potential mechanism neuro-recovery . We intend integrate new research finding develop evaluate physical exercise-based intervention target rescue brain tissue child brain tumor neuro-toxic impact cranial radiation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Survivors include 7 18 year age . Survivors include either declare English native language least two year school English time first assessment . Survivors must diagnose hemispheric posterior fossa tumor treat cranial spinal focal radiation . No 7 year may elapse diagnosis time study . Survivors shunt include study , need identify prior study onset discus specific consideration image physical activity . young 7 year ( delivery intervention program young child carry challenge make difficult include initial feasibility grant ) old 18 year require sedation MRI image severe neurological/motor dysfunction would preclude safe participation exercise program .</criteria>
