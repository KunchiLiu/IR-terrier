	<brief_summary>Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) , widely use neonatal intensive care also use infant severe acute bronchiolitis . There evidence nCPAP improve outcome , several study show reduces work breathing ( WOB ) , improve gas exchange decrease intubation rate . High flow nasal prong ( HFNP ) therapy , also use neonatal unit , recently suggest bronchiolitis management . This technique allow warmed moist gas administration protect nasal mucosa , prevent variation inspire gas FiO2 . HFNP also create continuous positive pressure , reduce WOB , seem much comfortable well tolerated baby nCPAP . There study compare technique bronchiolitis management . The main objective study compare WOB nCPAP HFNP therapy infant severe bronchiolitis pediatric intensive care unit . Secondary purpose compare efficacy tolerance technique . We propose lead open , single center , crossover randomize study . Each patient receive two treatment . Three consecutive period study : first one ( minimum 2 hour ) , first technique CPAP HFNP accord randomization ( treatment 1 ) ; second period ( 2 hour ) second technique ( treatment 2 ) ; Third period ( 6 hour ) second technique . The primary endpoint comparison WOB ( estimate calculation transdiaphragmatic pressure-time product ) end two first period . Efficacy tolerance technique evaluate compare compare measure respiratory rate , heart rate , FiO2 , SpO2 , transcutaneous PCO2 , modify Wood score , EDIN score third period . Nine subject group require .</brief_summary>
