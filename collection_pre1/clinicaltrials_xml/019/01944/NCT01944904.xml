	<brief_summary>This study aim determine whether use supplement call xylooligosaccharide ( XOS ) increase number good bacteria live human intestine maintain healthy blood sugar level , whether XOS unpleasant unexpected side effect consume different dosage . Subjects participate study randomize receive eight week supply either low dose XOS placebo ( active substance ) . This determine randomly , process similar flipping coin . Blood sample take visit , include oral glucose tolerance test . Subjects also ask collect bring stool sample three different time point study . Subjects 50/50 chance assign either study group . This double-blind study mean neither study investigator subject know group he/she assign . In case emergency , study doctor get information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Ability Supplement Increase Good Bacteria Human Intestine Blood Sugar Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prebiotics highly effective important many application medicine . They absorb contribute human nourishment , rather exert profound effect human bowel flora . The principal effect human bowel flora stimulate growth Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus specie . These benign organism seldom involved infection pathological process . However , numerous health promote benefit bacterial genus note , effect infectious non-infectious disease . They induce host gene involve innate immunity , sometimes collaboration element gut flora Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Lactobacillus casei . Animal study 2 indicate protective effect bacterial translocation GI tract . An extensive cataloguing genome bifidobacteria intestinal bacteria reveals bifids play significant role many important area carbohydrate , amino acid , nucleotide , lipid , inorganic ion transport metabolism ; energy production conversion ; cell wall membrane biogenesis ; signal transduction mechanism ; transcription translation ; defense mechanism . The metabolic syndrome include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , obesity , insulin resistance respond prebiotics rodent trial ; estimate 20-30 % population develop country disease . Parnell Reimer demonstrate prebiotics oligofructose supplementation potential promote weight loss improve glucose regulation overweight adult likely suppress ghrelin enhance PYY1 . The investigator complete study UCLA study effect XOS human microbiota . There three phase include 2-week run-in period , 8-week intervention period , 2-week washout . Thirty two volunteer randomly assign take supplement contain 1.4 g XOS ( 1.4g XOS 70P ) , 2.8 g XOS ( 2.8g XOS 70P ) placebo . Total 32 subject enrol study . One subject placebo group one low dose group drop study non specific gastrointestinal complaint . Altogether , 120 stool sample receive 11 low dose subject , 9 high dose subject , 10 placebo group subject . Bacterial culture perform 120 stool sample receive . One placebo group subject , two high dose group subject , two low dose group subject exclude analysis compromise specimen quality . The Bifidobacterium count subject high dose XOS intervention significantly high base line 4 , 8 , 10 week . Similarly , increase Bifidobacterium count significantly high high XOS group 4 week compare low XOS group . The low XOS group significantly high Bifidobacterium count compare placebo group subject 8 10 week . The total anaerobic flora count degree total aerobic flora count subject high dose XOS intervention significantly high base-line 4 8 week . The mean change total anaerobic flora count significantly high high XOS group 4 , 8 , 10 week compare placebo group . Interestingly , also Bacteroides fragilis group count subject high dose XOS intervention significantly high base line 4 , 8 , 10 week mean change significantly high high XOS group compare low placebo group . There major significant difference count Lactobacillus sp. , Enterobacteriaceae , clostridia three dose group evaluate The XOS tolerate well study subject ( normal adult ) . At base-line , subject relatively high count Bifidobacterium specie low count Lactobacillus specie . Several different specie genera present . Bifidobacterium specie show significant increase count subject XOS supplementation , high dose group show significantly great increase low dose group . Both high low dose group show significantly high count Bifidobacterium sub-species placebo group . Lactobacillus specie count increase significantly subject XOS supplementation . There statistically significant increase count B. fragilis group time period high dose XOS group . As mentioned , bifidobacteria may induce host gene involve innate immunity collaboration element gut flora B. fragilis group . The increase count `` total anaerobe '' reflect increase count Bifidobacterium B. fragilis group , anaerobic . Some Bifidobacterium specie may grow aerobically well , may reflect modest increase aerobic count high dose XOS group . In study , XOS supplementation significant effect stool pH SCFAs . The investigator propose conduct 10 week , randomize , placebo control , two arm study 20 subject metabolic syndrome . Subjects randomly assign take powder mixture contain 2.8 g XOS ( 2.94g XOS 95P ) placebo .</detailed_description>
