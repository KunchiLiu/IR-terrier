	<brief_summary>Cycled ( intermittent ) phototherapy compare continuous ( uninterrupted ) phototherapy treatment hyperbilirubinemia ( newborn jaundice ) extremely low birth weight newborn pilot randomize control trial . Hypothesis : Cycled phototherapy ( PT ) provide benefit continuous phototherapy extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants without risk associate continuous phototherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cycled Phototherapy : A Safer Effective Treatment Small Premature Infants ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phototherapy ( PT ) widely use assume safe well effective reduce total bilirubin ( TB ) level . Our recent NICHD Network Trial show aggressive use phototherapy reduces neurodevelopmental impairment ( NDI ) , may increase death among ELBW infant . Among ventilator treat infant &lt; 750 g birth weight ( BW ) ( n =696 ) , conservative Bayesian analysis ( use neutral prior probability ) identify 99 % ( posterior ) probability aggressive phototherapy reduce profound NDI 99 % probability increase death relative conservative phototherapy . The possibility PT increase death among high risk infant also suggest Collaborative Phototherapy trial ( performed 1970s ) , large RCT LBW infant randomly assign receive PT PT . The relative risk death among randomized PT relative randomize PT 1.32 ( 0.9-1.82 ) among LBW infant 1.49 ( 0.93-2.40 ) among ELBW infant . These finding consistent major increase mortality ignore p &gt; 0.05 , error often make ignore important potential treatment hazard power limit . Multiple study , perform decade ago large infant , find short on/off cycle PT ( e.g . 15 min on/60 min , 1 h on/3 h , 1 h on/1 h ) effective uninterrupted PT reduce TSB . ( Cycles &gt; 6 h PT appear effective uninterrupted PT ) . The clinical use uninterrupted rather cycle PT appear base largely assumption PT safe infant .</detailed_description>
