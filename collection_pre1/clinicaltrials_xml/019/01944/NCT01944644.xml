	<brief_summary>This double-blind , randomize , sham-controlled phase II study effect Low Field Magnetic Stimulation ( LFMS ) brain circuitry adult treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . Eligible subject randomly assign double-blind treatment three 20 minute session either ( 1 ) active LFMS ( 2 ) sham LFMS . Resting state fMRI perform baseline follow third final treatment session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A minimum 60 subject enter double-blind treatment phase study . This trial conduct accord U.S. Food Drug Administration guideline Declaration Helsinki . Written inform consent obtain patient protocol-specified procedure carry . The subject draw outpatient sample patient current Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) diagnose use Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) . LFMS follow previously publish protocol treatment Major Depressive Episode ( Rohan et al . 2004 ) . LFMS treatment deliver prototype LFMS device manufacture Tal Medical . LFMS session consist proton echo-planar magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( EP-MRSI ) 20min duration . LFMS expose subject magnetic field magnitude frequency use clinical MR-Spectroscopic imaging brain . Sham LFMS consist three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo sequence duration active LFMS provide auditory stimulation indistinguishable active treatment . At begin treatment session , subject sit front position head within open bore Tal Medical LFMS device . The device pre-programmed deliver active sham treatment subject , operator , investigator blind active treatment vs. sham . Immediately treatment session , PANAS , Ham-D-6 , Visual Analog Mood Scale administer patient monitored adverse event . All participant undergo two session neuroimaging : On Friday prior first treatment session ( Day 0 ) day third final treatment session ( Day 7 ) . Each session neuroimaging 50 minute duration include three image modality : Resting State fMRI ( rsfMRI ) , Arterial Spin Labeling MRI ( ASL ) , Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) . In addition , obtain high-resolution anatomical volume ( SPGR ) subject purpose transform individual 's imaging data common space group comparison . Subjects lie still scanner instructed let mind `` wander freely '' acquisition rest state fMRI scan , last 6 minute ( Anon 2001 ) . They also instruct lie still ASL DTI scan ( last 8 minute ) . In addition , obtain high-resolution T1-weighted ( MP-RAGE ) anatomical scan co-registration individual 's imaging data common space group statistics.. Resting state fMRI use measure functional connectivity within default mode network ( DMN ) circuit know function abnormally MDD ( Greicius et al . 2007 ) . ASL use measure regional blood flow within individual node circuitry , DTI measure structural integrity connection node . Measurements baseline compare measurement post-LFMS active treatment sham group .</detailed_description>
