	<brief_title>Teaching Associates Randomised Evaluate Effectiveness Gynaecological Pelvic Examination Versus Traditional Teaching Using Manikins</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Physical examination pelvis important core skill medical student need acquire . However , experience undergraduate vaginal examination become increasingly limited medical student Birmingham qualify without ever perform vaginal examination outpatient setting ( personal communication , Raut N ) . It well recognise intimate nature examination pose additional challenge medical student teacher gain consent supervise training . However , factor may affect student experience . These include compete pressure contemporary undergraduate medical curriculum result traditional clinical placement , obstetrics gynaecology ( O &amp; G ) , become shorten many academic medical institution . Empowerment patient combine change expectation interaction medical professional may restrict access clinical case . Changes attitude teach gynaecological examination may restrict patient ; medical educationalist may also become conservative less experienced find teach vaginal examination increase challenge . Whatever reason underlie diminishing exposure medical student gynaecological examination , current status quo unacceptable . Teaching innovation urgently require enhance teach skill fundamental gynaecological general medical practice . A strategy become increasingly popular use `` gynaecological teaching associate '' GTA 's short . These woman 'expert patient ' train undergo teach gynaecological examination , give valuable immediate feedback student . In North America GTA 's quite commonly use medical curriculum also use Canada , Australia Scandinavia . In UK pelvic examination still mainly taught simulation pelvic model ( manikin ) combine experience gain supervise teach woman attend outpatient clinic anaesthetise surgery within clinical attachment . However , length placement varies length throughout UK medical school quality experience likely inconsistent even within medical school . In 2011 Birmingham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) , institute GTA teach programme . Final year medical student University Birmingham Medical School allocate clinical placement O &amp; G BWH undergo GTA teaching within first week five week attachment . To date , keep Universities GTA programme experience , Oxford University Kings College , London ( 1 ) , student give universally positive feedback ( Clark TJ , Personal Communication ) . Anecdotal qualitative data student reassure whether GTA programme current design effective indeed cost-effective key educational outcome unclear . The publish data available generally descriptive study process institution GTA program undergraduate medical curriculum ( 2-7 ) . Studies address student competence confidence limit small , observational series . One non-randomised control study UK demonstrate student train GTA 's significantly well trained pelvic model alone ( 1 ) . However , study GTA train supplementary normal curriculum amount teach rather style teaching may act confound factor . Moreover , valid assessment tool use assess clinical performance . Evaluating educational benefit GTAs also important allocate scarce undergraduate educational resource efficiently . Gynaecological teaching associate pay professional introduce method teach financial implication Universities . At present , University Birmingham fully incorporate GTA teach final year O &amp; G curriculum 150/400 student place BWH taught way . Thus , opinion value GTAs yet solidify absence rigorous scientific assessment educational economic benefit GTAs , propose large randomise controlled trial . The RCT compare effectiveness cost-effectiveness teach female pelvic examination medical student use GTAs traditional teaching use pelvic manikin . Objectives The TARGET RCT design answer follow research question : Principal Research Question â€¢ Do gynaecological teaching associate improve level confidence medical student perform gynaecological pelvic examination compare manikin base teach ? Secondary Research question - Do Gynaecological Teaching Associates improve level competence medical student perform gynaecological pelvic examination compare manikin base teach ? - Do follow factor affect competence confidence medical student perform gynaecological pelvic examination : student gender ; ethnicity ; perception clinical placement ; number supervise vaginal examination conduct clinical placement ? - Are Gynaecological Teaching Associates cost-effective ?</detailed_description>
