	<brief_title>Robotic-assisted Pedicule Screw Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The medical device subject research surgical robot ROSA™ design cranial surgery , use another application , spinal surgery - specifically placement pedicle screw . It intend spine surgeon treat disease require placement pedicle screw posterior open surgery approach minimally invasive surgery . The system allow precise guidance instrument define surgeon patient radiological image . The expected performance good rate pedicle screw placement , increase performance observe conventional method . This system transport one operating room another , store storage room . It interfaces common intra -operative surgical image system ( mobile C-arms available Montpellier University Hospital ) . Further version device enable use 3D intra-operative image system O-arm Medtronic . The main objective study evaluate feasibility use robot ROSA™ pedicle screw placement . In study , robot use open surgery approach , first step demonstrate potential robot .</detailed_description>
