	<brief_title>Effects Whey Protein Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whey protein account 20 % whole milk protein seem induce insulinotropic /β-cell-stimulating glucose lower effect via bioactive peptide generate gastrointestinal digestion . These bioactive peptide stimulate release GLP-1 , serve endogenous inhibitor DPP-4 cause inhibitory activity α-glucosidase activity , might additional mechanism accounting glucose lowering effect Whey . In investigator previous study , acute administration Whey protein result postprandial insulinotropic glucose lower effect type 2 diabetic subject . This associate increase postprandial response total-GLP-1 intact-GLP-1 , suggest peptide generate Whey protein may dual beneficial effect ( increase incretin production decrease incretin degradation DPP-4 ) glycemia regulation subject type 2 diabetes . Addition Whey protein meal , significantly decrease PPG healthy type 2 diabetic subject also clinical evidence non-diabetics individual , acute chronic administration Whey protein antihypertensive activity . The effect chronic administration Whey protein HbA1c PPG examine previously type 2 diabetic .</detailed_description>
