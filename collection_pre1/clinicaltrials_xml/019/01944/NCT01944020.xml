	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) characterize recurrent episode partial complete loss airflow sleep , due narrow closure upper airway . The result hypoxia many cardiometabolic consequence , lead disruption sleep quality include reduction expression rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep slow wave sleep ( SWS ) . Patients also frequently experience excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) , , present OSA , define clinical entity OSA syndrome ( OSAS ) . Obesity lead risk factor development OSA . Interestingly , suggest disorder may contribute weight gain , present vicious cycle wherein OSA obesity perpetuate . OSAS may promote weight gain place patient state positive energy balance characterize low level physical activity disrupt pattern appetite-regulating hormone . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , gold-standard treatment OSAS , may improve energy balance patient , although yet adequately study . The current proposal investigate effect 2 month CPAP energy balance cardiovascular risk obese patient moderate-to-severe OSA EDS . Patients instructed use CPAP home night throughout 2-month treatment phase . At baseline conclusion 2-month treatment phase , investigator measure level free-living physical activity , sleepiness , sleep quality , body composition , cardiovascular risk factor , appetite-regulating hormone , hunger , ad libitum food intake . It hypothesize active compare sham CPAP treatment result improvement energy balance , include increased physical activity , reduction abnormally high level circulate leptin level , reduction hunger , food intake , cardiovascular risk factor . These improvement hypothesize associated increase expression REM sleep SWS , reduce EDS result CPAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study investigate effect 2 mo continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) physical activity , energy intake ( EI ) , cardiovascular risk factor overweight/obese patient moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) . Following pre-experimental baseline measure , patient instruct use CPAP home night throughout 2 mo treatment phase . Before 2 mo treatment phase , patient undergo 1-d in-lab testing period Clinical Research Resource ( CRR ) Columbia University Medical Center . Upon completion laboratory phase 1 , patient return home 2 mo treatment period , follow second tracking period include laboratory visit 2 . At conclusion 2 mo treatment phase , patient enter laboratory Columbia University Medical Center 1-d period . Patients arrive ~0800 h remain laboratory follow 24 h. Blood sample fast state morning , assay select appetite-regulating hormone ( leptin , ghrelin , adiponectin , glucagon-like peptide-1 ) . We al , assess body composition . During laboratory day , ad libitum EI measure treatment phase . Breakfast , lunch , snack , dinner serve standard time , meal item serve excess patient able eat much little food choose . Additional snack choice also freely available wake episode .</detailed_description>
