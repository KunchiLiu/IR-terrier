	<brief_title>Phase II Study Vismodegib Patients With Refractory Relapsed B-cell Lymphoma Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter open-label phase II study . Primary objective : To evaluate efficacy vismodegib patient relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma CLL measure best overall response rate ( ORR ) treatment period . Secondary objective : - To evaluate tolerability safety vismodegib patient relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma CLL - To evaluate efficacy vismodegib patient relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma CLL measure overall ( OR ) complete response ( CR ) rate study period , maximum tumor shrinkage , duration response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . - To examine expression GLI-1 Hedgehog ( Hh ) signal component tumor specimens treatment vismodegib correspond efficacy patient . 44 patient include study equally distribute 4 cohort accord histological subtype : - Cohort 1 : 11 patient Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) - Cohort 2 : 11 patient `` indolent '' lymphoma ( iNHL ) : Follicular ( FL ) , mantle cell ( MCL ) marginal zone lymphoma ( MZL ) lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma ( LPL ) / Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia ( WM ) , small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) - Cohort 3 : 11 patient Primary central nervous system lymphoma ( PCNSL ) - Cohort 4 : 11 patient Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . After 28 day screen period ( Baseline ) , patient treat Vismodegib 150 mg per o maximum 12 month disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient consent withdrawal , death , reason deem treat physician study termination Sponsor . Tumour assessment ( clinical examination , laboratory test , abdominal chest CT scan ( PCNSL baseline ) , +/- PET scan DLBCL , +/- brain MRI CSF examination ophthalmic examination PCNSL , +/- bone marrow examination ( except PCNSL ) perform baseline , every 2 month first 6 month treatment , every 3 month thereafter disease progression 6 month study treatment stop . Response treatment assess also Pharmacodynamic study tumor sample immunohistochimic qPCR analysis baseline one month treatment vismodegib . Pharmacokinetic study ( 1 month treatment ) also perform . After study treatment discontinuation , patient follow every 3 month disease progression 6 month ( 1 year treatement ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL , MCL , FL , MZL , LPL/WM , SLL PCNSL ) CLL ( Matutes score ≥4 ) require treatment recurrent least one prior therapy potentially curative therapy well treatment option available . Specifically , patient receive treatment consider standard care , include stem cell transplantation ( appropriate , patient eligible ) , agent know significant clinical efficacy disease.Patient must eligible tumor biopsy . Biopsy relapse mandatory patient except PCNSL ( optional ) provide enough tumor tissue biological test ( paraffinembedded frozen RNAlaterconserved tissue ) . Age 18 old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 , 1 2 Signed inform consent Life expectancy ≥ 3 month Patients receive maximum 4 line treatment ( include radiotherapy ) Patients must recover toxicity relate prior treatment ≤ grade 1 . Adequate Laboratory Parameters ( unless abnormality relate underlying disease ) within 28 day prior sign inform consent , include : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/μL Platelet ≥ 75,000/μL Hemoglobin &gt; 8.5 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( UNL ) Hepatic enzyme ( AST , ALT ) ≤ 3 x institutional ULN Measurable disease : Cohort 1 2 ( DLBCL iNHL ) : Bidimensionally measurable disease CT scan least 2cm long diameter . Cohort 3 ( PCNSL ) : Measurable PCNSL MRI gadolinium enhancement ( minimal size ) , intraocular lymphoma ( IOL ) , measurable disease fundoscopic examination elevate level IL10 ( &gt; 10 pg/ml ) acqueous humor . Cohort 4 ( CLL ) : Measurable disease assessable blood ( lymphocytosis , cytopenia ) and/or imaging ( bidimensionally measurable disease CT scan least 2cm long diameter ) Patient must able take oral medication Females childbearing potential ( FCBP ) must : negative pregnancy test ( serum urine , sensitivity &lt; = 25IU HCG/L ) within 96 hour prior start study drug administration . Agree use two reliable form contraception practice complete abstinence heterosexual contact whole treatment period 7 month discontinuation study drug treatment Male patient must agree : use condom female childbearing potential practice complete abstinence whole treatment period 7 month discontinuation study drug treatment . To abstain donate semen whole treatment period 7 month discontinuation study drug treatment For patient receive vismodegib ( GDC0449 ) : To agree abstain donate blood whole study least 7 month discontinuation study drug treatment To agree share study medication another person Pregnant breastfeeding lactate female . For CLL patient , clinically significant autoimmune cytopenia , Coombspositive hemolytic anemia judge treat physician Concomitant antitumor therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , corticosteroid , target therapy , radiation therapy ) . Corticosteroids may authorize PCNSL maximum 3 week ( and/or begin treatment vismodegib ) maximum dose 1mg/kg prednisone equivalent . Use standard experimental anticancer drug therapy within 28 day prior study drug therapy ( Day 1 ) . Patients severe renal failure ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min accord Cockcroft &amp; Gault formula ) and/or undergoing dialysis . Note : Patients moderate renal insufficiency ( i.e . creatinine clearance ≥ 30 ml/min ) may include . Uncontrolled and/or unstable concomitant disease infection require treatment intravenous antibiotic . HIV positive serology Active hepatitis B C History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation study result expose patient high risk treatment complication . Patients unable comply protocol requirement accord investigator</criteria>
