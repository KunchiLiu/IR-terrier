	<brief_summary>Primary Aim . The primary aim determine effectiveness intradialytic massage frequency severity cramp among hemodialysis patient prone low extremity cramp treatment . Hypothesis : Compared control patient , intervention patient significantly less likely intradialytic cramping require staff intervention treatment termination . This study involve 32 ( 16 intervention , 16 control ) hemodialysis patient frequent low extremity cramp treatment . Frequent cramp dialysis treatment define 1 episode low extremity cramp dialysis previous 2 week . Cramping frequency determine chart note . Muscle cramp define contraction large muscle group low extremity sufficiently painful require intervention dialysis staff relief . The intervention group receive 20 minute massage low extremity train licensed massage therapist treatment ( 3x per week ) 2 week . The control group receive usual care dialysis center staff .</brief_summary>
