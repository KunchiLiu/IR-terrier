	<brief_title>The TAKO-TSUBO And Cancer Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis patient TTC believe favorable . This assumption mainly base observation rapid recovery global leave ventricular function low cardiac in-hospital mortality . In fact , clinical course follow TTC event hospital discharge largely unknown due lack large prospective long-term follow-up study inconsistent limited finding available study date . The TTAC registry represent first attempt initiate international registry special focus comorbidities , particularly malignancy , patient TTC elucidate relationship disease . In addition , TTAC registry enable document exact underlying cause death long-term prognosis patient TTC identify possible predictor short long-term mortality patient . The first objective prospective , multicenter , observational registry evaluate prevalence incidence cancer patient TTC . The second objective document underlie cause death hospital stay follow-up determine long-term prognosis patient TTC . The third objective identify possible predictor short long-term mortality patient TTC . Available information collect subject treat accord routine clinical practice . In addition , index hospitalization , subject screen occult cancer disease . During follow-up , cancer screening perform accord appropriate legal preventive examination . Subjects follow 6 month annually index event 5 year phone call , office visit , contact primary physician refer cardiologist , accord investigator 's preference . As regulated data protection privacy law accordance local ethic committee requirement , subject inform request grant approval index procedure ( = cardiac catheterization suspect acute coronary syndrome ) review medical record collect analyze personal medical information . The confidentiality record maintain time . Subjects ask agree perform cancer screen index hospitalization also ask agree contact 5-year follow-up period . Patients TTC diagnose informed request grant approval review medical record , collect analyze personal medical information , maintain confidentiality record time . Subjects ask agree perform cancer screen index hospitalization also ask agree contact 5-year follow-up period . Informed consent request index procedure ( = cardiac catheterization suspect acute coronary syndrome prove presence TTC ) inform consent form ( ICF ) sign prior enter subject 's data database prior follow-up contact , whichever occur first . The investigator and/or designee must clearly document process obtain informed consent subject 's source document . The voluntary process obtain informed consent confirms subject 's willingness participate registry . It investigator 's responsibility ensure informed consent process perform accordance Good Epidemiological Practice ( GEP ) - IEA Guidelines proper conduct epidemiological research applicable country regulation . Subjects follow 6 month annually index event 5 year phone call , office visit , contact general practitioner refer cardiologist , accord investigator 's preference .</detailed_description>
