	<brief_summary>Previously demonstrate expose heart electromagnetic field exercise stress test improve recovery follow stress test . This explained effect electromagnetic field sympathetic activity heart . In present study would like investigate effect electromagnetic field autonomic nervous system function patient chronic musculoskeletal pain usually high sympathetic activity . Each patient expose 20 minute electromagnetic field autonomic nervous system function measure . In addition , patient tolerability expose magnetic field investigate . We assume short exposure electromagnetic field would result decreased sympathetic activity therefore , long run , could suggest therapeutic tool patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adult patient suffer chronic muscoloskeletal pain recruit study weekly visit Department Complementary Medicine Sheba Medical Center . Patient expose 20 minute weak intensity low frequency electromagnetic field seat , heart rate variability measure record . In addition , patient tolerability expose electromagnetic field investigate , include VAS score ( pain score ) . This double blind placebo-control study neither patient physician know treatment give patient . The study code open end trial .</detailed_description>
