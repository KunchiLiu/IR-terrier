	<brief_summary>It well document proportion inappropriate transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTEs ) high ambulatory environment , report high 30 % . Therefore , potential improve TTE utilization may greatest outpatient setting . However , study date evaluate whether Appropriate Use Criteria ( AUC ) -based educational intervention reduce inappropriate TTEs setting . The investigator therefore design first randomize control trial AUC-based educational feedback intervention aim reduce inappropriate outpatient TTEs order cardiology internal medicine physician training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator design randomized , control trial AUC-based educational feedback intervention design reduce proportion inappropriate TTEs cardiology internal medicine outpatient practice Massachusetts General Hospital . A random number generator divide 24 cardiology fellow 88 internal medicine resident control intervention arm . During study , physicians intervention arm receive follow multi-faceted educational intervention TTE appropriateness : 1 ) lecture begin study period , describe AUC echocardiography highlight common clinical scenario outpatient TTEs order , 2 ) electronic `` pocket card '' via email provide tip appropriate order TTEs , 3 ) individualize monthly feedback report categorize TTEs order precede month . The feedback report contain number TTEs order month many classified appropriate , inappropriate , uncertain base 2011 AUC . A description inappropriate TTEs rationale inappropriate classification provide . The physician control arm TTE order track classified , receive feedback order behavior . While study participant blind arm study , blind arm study colleague . Prior start intervention , study participant receive knowledge assessment survey . The survey include five case-based question design assess knowledge AUC TTE also question regard attitude toward diagnostic testing . Each participant also receive post-study knowledge assessment survey . The primary outcome measure study rate inappropriate appropriate TTEs . Secondary outcome measure include number TTEs order , common appropriate inappropriate TTE indication , pre- post-study knowledge assessment score among study physician .</detailed_description>
