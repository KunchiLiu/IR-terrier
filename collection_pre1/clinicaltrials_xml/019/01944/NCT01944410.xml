	<brief_summary>The traumatic bone cyst ( TBC ) infrequent nonepithelial line cavity jaw , first express lucassin 1929 , lesion attract great deal interest dental literature , pathogenesis still evidently recognize . It determine bone cavity irregular shape appear like cyst radiograph , histopathologically elements confirm diagnosis cyst . TBC international histological classification assume World Health Organisation odontogenic tumour utilizes term `` solitary bone cyst '' , nevertheless term `` traumatic bone cyst '' ( TBC ) extensively used literature . The WHO classification explain TBC non-neoplastic osseous lesion demonstrate epithelial lining , differentiate lesion true cyst . There general conformity traumatic bone cyst present without symptom sign . Seldom , expansion cortical plate may occur extraoral swelling , less commonly may erosion cortical bone may take place . ' Teeth area involve bone usually remain vital , without root resorption tooth mobility . Treatment traumatic bone cyst include surgical exploration curettage motivate bleeding within bony cavity , ' pack cyst cavity Gelfoam saturate thrombin penicillin , bone grafting base previous study Injection autogeneic blood bony cavity traumatic bone cyst follow rapid resolution lesion . Platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) rich source growth factor . The growth factor present PRP familiar , include transform growth factor-_ ( TGF-_1 TGF-_2 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor , 3 isomer platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF-__ , PDGF-__ , PDGF-__ ) , endothelial growth factor . These growth factor consider capacity accelerate chemotaxis , mitogenesis , angiogenesis , synthesis collagen matrix support tissue repair apply bone wound . Due high platelet content , PRP use orthopaedic surgery , oral implantology , periodontics aim make repair process fast natural possible , potentially afford considerable tissue improvement bone soft tissue similar way . PRP easily acquire , rich cell signal molecule , completely autogenous obtain minimal blood volumes.the purpose present study determine efficacy PRP treatment mandibular TBC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use PRP Treatment Mandibular Traumatic Bone Cyst</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study sample consist 12 young adult volunteer present TBC mandible . Local ethical committee approval obtain trial start . Laboratory test ( complete blood count , glucose , creatinine , platelet , lipid profile ) perform patient . These test provide important overview patient health baseline analysis prognosis PRP use . The process obtain PRP basically consist collection 20-mL sample blood , centrifugation sample 8 min , isolation 1-mL aliquot plasma collect near erythrocyte fraction . Surgical procedure include : surgical exploration injection PRP stimulate bone regeneration within bony cavity . Bone repair assess panoramic X-rays obtain 2 , 4 , 6 month postoperatively . Bone density measure area histogram analysis .</detailed_description>
