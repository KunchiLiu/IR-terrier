	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death among Canadians . In diabetes , cardiovascular complication responsible 70 % death . While much interest identify treat risk factor , exact biological mechanism , measurement optimal way prevent manage poorly understood . Physical activity regular exercise prevent diabetes effectively manage risk factor , Canadians exercise enough beneficially manage risk . Tailored exercise prescribe family physician show promise mean increase fitness reduce risk , optimal implementation practice remain unknown - especially rural remote community reduce access healthcare . Mobile health technology prove beneficial tool achieve blood pressure blood glucose control patient diabetes . These technology may address limited access health intervention rural remote region . However , potential tool support exercise-based prevention activity unknown . Therefore , study undertaken investigate effect tailor exercise prescription alone support mobile health technology improve cardiovascular risk factor rural community-dwelling adult risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Adults cardiovascular risk factor recruit rural community randomize either : 1 ) intervention group receive exercise prescription device monitoring risk factor smartphone data portal equip mobile health application ; 2 ) active control group receive exercise prescription . It hypothesize intervention group would reduce risk great extent active control group follow 12 week , improvement would well maintain intervention group 24 52 week compare active control group .</brief_summary>
