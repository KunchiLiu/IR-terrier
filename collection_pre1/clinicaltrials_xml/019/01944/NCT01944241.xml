	<brief_summary>Over last 20 year , cervical screening program huge success reduce cervical cancer rate . These program do screen woman risk develop cancer regular smear test . Women abnormal smear follow colposcopy clinic , need , cervical surgery perform remove pre-cancerous area cervix . Surgery cervix include LLETZ ( Large loop excision transformation zone ) treatment cone biopsy . Many study last year look impact necessary surgery function cervix . These study mainly find association LLETZ treatment increase risk preterm labour . There large study investigate effect cervical surgery may fertility . The investigator would like examine impact cervical surgery may woman 's future fertility . It postulate cervical surgery may cause cervix close , prevent sperm get may cause change secretion cervix , secretion necessary normal interaction sperm . The investigator would like send questionnaire woman attend colposcopy . The investigator ask woman series question relate fertility desire divide woman two group depend whether woman need cervical surgery pre-cancerous lesion . Hypothesis : That cervical surgery impact function cervix fertility .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cervical Surgery Fertility Effect ( c-SAFE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With increase amount young woman undergo cervical surgery treatment CIN , fertility consequence need investigate . Infertility estimate affect approximately one six one ten couple half seek medical assistance . Causes infertility include anovulation , tubal occlusion , endometriosis , cervical male factor . In approximately one third case , cause find couple unable conceive . Many recent study look likely association cervical surgery increase risk preterm labour . It also suggest Australian study even woman untreated CIN high risk preterm delivery , although unclear whether related CIN , HPV effect inflammatory change cervix . Studies need clarify . There study publish literature , investigate possibility cervical surgery effect long term fertility . Most study small under-powered . Kennedy et al 1993 raise possibility cervical stenosis amucorrhoea follow LLETZ retrospective study . In study , 15 2315 woman LLETZ , subsequently see fertility clinic . 2 15 woman study cervical stenosis . The author advise caution use LLETZ young woman mild moderate dyskaryosis , although investigator concede number small draw definite conclusion . Bigrigg et al 1994 perform case control questionnaire regard safety efficacy LLETZ involve question regard infertility . There 250 match pairs- woman LLETZ ( study group ) woman identify normal cytology database ( control group ) , entire study , 134 woman answer question infertility ( 72 LLETZ group 62 control group ) . The investigator report apparent difference infertility group . Again study limit size -72 study group 62 control group could remember long take conceive . Cruickshank et al 1995 , follow 653 woman follow LLETZ questionnaire find none woman subsequently investigate infertility find cervical stenosis amucorrhoea . Again study limit size incomplete response rate . Of 653 woman , majority report stopped contraception since treatment - 452 . Only 57 woman report try become pregnant , 11 succeed , 144 woman answer question intention become pregnant . It difficult draw conclusion incomplete data small number As cervix necessary sperm transit subsequent fertility , likely factor , affect cervix , would also affect fertility . Therefore , woman attend colposcopy abnormal cervical cytology may already increase risk fertility problem treatment surgery may accentuate . In relation cervical surgery , three potential mechanism damage propose : 1 . Cervical stenosis - need complete prevent sperm entry . 2 . Secondary infection lead ascend infection tubal damage . 3 . Changes physical characteristic cervical mucus . However must note surgery cervix . Specimens LLETZ cone treatment vary size considerably would intuitively suspect also confirm study , thickness volume specimens predict relative risk pregnancy relate morbidity . No study look whether size effect also relate fertility . Some study suggest sub-fertile woman attend IVF likely abnormal cervical cytology . As HPV relate , may also likely sexually transmit infection . These may cause tubal damage , thus lead infertility problem . The psychological impact receive abnormal smear result attend colposcopy also investigate . Recent study show woman concern anxiety potential effect result treatments patient ' long term fertility . To able adequately reassure woman negative consequence reproductive health vital investigator research fertility effect well obstetric effect possible treatment may . The investigator would like investigate relationship cervical surgery infertility large group woman attend colposcopy clinic National Maternity Hospital , Holles Street year 2001 2007 .</detailed_description>
