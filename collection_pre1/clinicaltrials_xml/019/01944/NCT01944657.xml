	<brief_summary>A . Introduction Problem This field experiment intend explore whether supplemental transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) effective standard medication mono-therapy treatment major depressive disorder . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) include practice guideline American Psychiatric Association treatment major depression . B . Importance Area Study The safety , efficacy value TMS treatment establish four-phase FDA approval process . The evidence TMS safety efficacy derive multiple , peer review , double-blind , randomize , control trial ( RCT ) sham control well strict enrollment methodological requirement . TMS use actual clinical practice opportunity extend laboratory research typical , highly controlled field setting apply setting . This study design gather data safety , efficacy utility TMS use clinical practice . C. Need Additional Research Efficacy safety intervention scientifically establish meta-analyses study underscore efficacy safety two treatment intervention employ study : 1 ) standard medication monotherapy 2 ) standard medication therapy supplement TMS . However , many author conclude depression difficult treat ongoing need additional research . Depression remain major public health problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplemental Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) vs. Standard Medication Monotherapy Treating Major Depression : An Exploratory Field Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fifteen TMS treatment subject select patient population serve free-standing psychiatric hospital program ( i.e. , Sheppard Pratt Health System ) . There approximately 40 patient currently enrol TMS program TMS sample frame reference . Fifteen standard medication therapy subject select patient population treat private , outpatient psychiatric practice Northern Virginia . There hundreds outpatient treat outpatient practice standard medication therapy sample frame reference . The sample size adequate achieve 95 % level confidence acceptable margin error . Consistent stringent inclusion exclusion criterion , anticipate fairly homogeneous comparable study grouping identify . Again , due limit number TMS patient eligible enrollment study , non-random , non-probability assignment match method use make sure study group , base upon demographic clinical characteristic , similar important respect . TMS treatment administer utilizing NeuroStar TMS Therapy® Machine manufacture Neuronetics , Inc. Malvern , Pennsylvania . Treatment fix 120 % magnetic field intensity relative subject 's resting motor threshold repetition rate ten magnetic pulse per second , stimulus train duration ( i.e. , time ) 4 second inter train interval ( i.e. , time ) 26 second . The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex treatment location site determine adjust TMS coil 5 cm anterior motor threshold location along left superior oblique plane rotation point tip patient 's nose . Each treatment session last approximately 37.5 minute administer 3,000 magnetic pulse course treatment session . Repetitive TMS perform left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Each TMS subject receive minimum thirty TMS treatment ( i.e. , ideally five treatment per week six week ) 10 - Hz treatment ( 1,200 pulse per treatment day ) 90 % motor threshold . The standard medication treatment group receive standard medication treatment period eight week . As describe earlier table , medication could include bupropion ( Wellbutrin others ) , citalopram ( Celexa others ) , Clomipramine ( Ananfranil others ) , duloxetine ( Cymbalta ) , escitalopram ( Lexapro others ) , fluoxetine ( Prozac others ) , fluvoxamine ( Luvox others ) , imipramine ( Tofranil others ) , mirtazapine ( Remeron others ) , nortriptylatine ( Pamelor , Aventyl , others ) , paroxetine ( Paxil , Pexeva , others ) , phenelzine ( Nardil ) , sertraline ( Zoloft others ) , tranylcypromine ( Parnate others ) , venlafaxine ( Effexor others ) . Consents base line measure obtain . The TMS standard medication therapy subject select patient population one three less adequate response standard medication therapy . One group ( 15 patient ) receive TMS well standard medication therapy group ( 15 patient ) continue current medication . The study include analysis pre-treatment post-treatment psychiatric assessment depression treatment outcome use Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire ( ATRQ ) , Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD ) administer psychiatrist well patient self-report version Inventory Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS-SR ) . Satisfaction utility data obtain administration Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ( CSQ 8 ) /3 Supplemental Questions eleven utility question . Measures utilized study divide two group . One group observer rat group subject rat . The observer-rated instrument include Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire ( ATRQ ) , Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD 17 ) . Subject-Rated measure include Inventory Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Version ( IDS-SR ) Client Satisfaction Questionnaire ( CSQ 8 ) . It empirically demonstrate widely recognize instrument significant reliability internal consistency . Inter - rater reliability insured observation comparison . One psychiatrist rater TMS plus medication group another psychiatrist rater medication group . Both researcher experience clinician subscribe generally accept clearly define score criterion score rule . Additional effort maximize inter - rater consistency provide raters opportunity discuss previous practical experience raters utilize particular instrument well practice rating exercise . Statistically , degree consistency two psychiatrist determine calculate coefficient correlation coefficient inter - scorer reliability . The study four measurement point : baseline , four week , six week eight week TMS treatment standard medication therapy provide one group standard medication therapy group . TMS session schedule daily five day sequence week , minimum twenty session ( four week ) maximum thirty session ( six week ) . TMS session administer Monday Friday basis . Even though TMS standard medication therapy FDA approve treatment treatment deliver accordance FDA approval TMS medical device FDA approval prescribe medication , subject safety assess treatment site every treatment session , necessary , adverse event report generate submit IRB . Again , propose study , sample size relatively small , base upon result early study TMS , effect size project value great zero population consideration great `` nonzero '' value , great probability TMS standard medication therapy manifest effect hypothesize . This entirely consistent Bayesian design experiment outcomes early study influence design propose clinical trial TMS standard medication therapy . Bayesian experimental design predicate belief sound decision optimal utility make achieve regard propose experimental design despite uncertainty future resource limitation well ethical constraint involve human subject . The goal experimental design circumstance maximize probability accrue accurate data within criterion financial , timing , geographic cost consideration . It also note Bayesian technique contribute sound experimental design , also afford statistical technique promote `` Bayesian '' approach emphasize probability rather frequency interpret summarize data . This proven particularly useful experimental design small sample size . All personal clinical information keep strictly confidential . Only treat psychiatrist principle investigator access identify information . As soon practicably possible , subject information assign number lieu subject name protect confidentiality . All data report aggregate , safeguard confidentiality . The confidentiality study participant maintain follow establish procedure : 1 . Data sheet paper record properly dispose . 2 . Access limit . 3 . Research record data store locked cabinet secure database . All direct identifier participant remove data order allow data analyze without risk accidental disclosure private information . The de-identifying data accomplish combination cod anonymizing .</detailed_description>
