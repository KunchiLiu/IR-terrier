	<detailed_description>Study Design The study design prospective randomise control trial . Eligible patient department oncology , cardiology respiratory medicine Aarhus University Hospital include study randomise two group : one receive usual care receive usual care ACP . Patients recruit one department time , allow recruitment period six month department . Because patient terminal cardiac respiratory disease know unpredictable life expectancy cancer patient , initial recruitment cardiology respiratory medicine department , respectively.9 This procedure enhance possibility estimate number death three diagnose group register within study period ( see power calculation ) . The research group long ongoing close cooperation department mention collaboration establish . Practical Execution The researcher ( applicant ) provide list patient attend outpatient clinic follow day . Using identification tool ( see Appendix 1 ) researcher ass patient , identify patient anticipate need palliative supportive care . Patients ` data find Electronic Patient Files ( EPJ ) . After patient see staff outpatient 's clinic , researcher ask doctor clinic whether he/she would surprise patient die within next 6-12 month . ( i.e . `` The surprise Question '' ) . 10 If answer , patient enrol study . Within two day hereafter patient contact mail later telephone . Information ACP give write verbally . If patient accepts , inform write consent obtain . Returning consent form blank respond two reminder consider decline . Patients randomise usual standard ; non-research staff carry randomisation use sealed envelope contain allocation card assign random number . All patient include study receive questionnaire concern quality care ( see questionnaire data ) . The patient also ask point close relative likely accept participation . Participating relative approach order fill questionnaires patient ` trajectory bereavement period ( see questionnaire data ) . Intervention Patients intervention group offer formal ACP discussion researcher . This conducted discussion researcher patient base Respecting Patient Choices model.11 This programme , develop Austin Hospital Melbourne , Australia , base Respecting Choices programme involves coordinate approach ACP whereby facilitator , collaboration treat doctor , assist patient family reflect patient 's goal , value , belief , discuss document future choices health care . Patients encourage appoint proxy document preference end-of-life care ; include preference life prolong treatment cardiopulmonary resuscitation record Advance Care Plan ( see Appendix 2 ) . Whenever possible , treat doctor participate discussion ensure patient understand illness , treatment option , likely prognosis . The discussion audio tap scientific use ACP document EPJ . The discussion take place hospital patient 's home . With acceptance patient , general practitioner community nurse receive copy ACP document . Patients encourage include close relative ACP discussion . The aim complete ACP discussion within two week identification patient outpatient ` clinic . Consistent usual practice patient control group receive usual medical psychosocial care formalise ACP discussion . Data Collection Demographic data : collect enrolment include age , sex , education , child live home , admission diagnosis , existence form request resuscitation , whether patient proxy , whether patient already EPJ document preference end-of-life care , include life prolong treatment cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Data collect EPJ questionnaire , respectively . Questionnaire Data A thorough literature review exist , validated tool conduct . Accordingly questionnaires compose validated well-established questionnaire supplement ad hoc question exist questionnaire available . Translation adaption well pilot test accordance international guideline perform use . All patient request fill questionnaire three four week inclusion relatives similarly ask evaluate care time.12 In case patient dy within study period , bereave relative receive questionnaire evaluating level stress , anxiety depression well questionnaire concern quality patient ` end-of-life care preference place care death.13-15 Power Calculation Based exist literature , expect proportion patient whose end-of-life preference know 15 % increase 65 % would represent clinically meaningful effect . To achieve 90 % power detect difference primary outcome group certainty 95 % , estimate 22 death would require group , i.e . 44 deaths total . It therefore plan continue inclusion period least 22 death observe group among patient enrol . In similar study , population include patient average lifespan 3.5 month time inclusion death 86 % include patient die study period 20 months.16 In order observe 44 death , estimate inclusion 90 patient necessary . The estimated inclusion period approximately 18 month . Perspectives The project integrate part large research program within palliative field . The project , focus create good trajectory well treatment patient throughout end terminal illness , highly relevant . The ongoing development palliative care lack evidence characterises area challenge health care even also deal utilisation limit financial resource . If ACP effective Danish context , improve end-of-life care patient family reduce psychological distress bereave relative . ACP may therefore contribute rational use health care resource well tool help patient preference meet . Ethics Terminally ill patient vulnerable group involve research . However , research group positive experience involve patient relatives kind research . The patient ' main motivation participate help others similar situation . It also note patient treat less favourably current standard procedure healthcare . It optional patient relatives intervention group , whether wish participate ACP .</detailed_description>
