	<brief_summary>The aerobic fitness important mountain bikers , rider also able generate maximal supramaximal effort crucial phase competition . Although increase interest high-intensity aerobic training , investigator knowledge , study examine effect interval ( INTV ) intermittent training ( INTM ) mountain bikers . The aim study compare effect INTV INTM aerobic fitness variable ( peak power output , Wmax , lactate threshold , onset blood lactate accumulation ) importantly performance measure use control mountain bike race , i.e . simulation . The investigator hypothesize INTV INTM train equally effective improve Wmax , Lactate threshold onset blood lactate accumulation , INTV superior enhance performance mountai bike race simulation.This hypothesis due study show high gain performance long duration aerobic high intensity interval train comparison short training high intensity .</brief_summary>
