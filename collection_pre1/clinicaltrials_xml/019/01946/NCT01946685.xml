	<brief_summary>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) common disable psychiatric disorder . Left untreated under-treated , become chronic condition associate significant distress , depression , aggression , family disruption , substance abuse . There also accumulate evidence combat-related PTSD associate increase risk morbidity mortality . For welfare return veteran PTSD family , critical disorder promptly identify effectively treat . Considerable advance make assessment treatment PTSD recent year ; however , psychopharmacological treatment show largely ineffective veteran PTSD . To address gap , proposal seek test innovative treatment approach PTSD - pharmacological manipulation body 's major stress system ( hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis ) mifepristone . At high dos mifepristone glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) antagonist peripheral central nervous system effect , make compound interest treatment stress related disorder . There abundant evidence enhance GR sensitivity veteran PTSD think underlie symptoms PTSD associate disturbance mood cognition . Thus , blockade GR receptor mifepristone may target unique aspect PTSD lead clinically meaningful improvement symptom cognition . There preliminary evidence short-term mifepristone treatment sustain beneficial effect mood , cognition sleep disturbance neuropsychiatric condition ( major depression , bipolar disorder , primary insomnia ) . That sustain clinical neuropsychological effect mifepristone normalization basal HPA axis activity drug discontinuation disorder , lead view mifepristone 's action include recalibration dysregulated HPA axis . Accordingly , propose study effect mifepristone veteran chronic PTSD determine efficacious improve PTSD symptom associate clinical outcome . To good understand mechanism action mifepristone propose assess effect mifepristone HPA axis activity relationship treatment outcome clinical response . To achieve objective , propose conduct Phase IIa , multi-site , double-blind , placebo control trial mifepristone veteran outpatient military-related PTSD VA 's Cooperative Clinical Trial Award program . We propose enroll 136 unmedicated male veteran military relate PTSD four VA site ( Albuquerque , NM , Bronx , NY , Durham , NC , San Diego , CA ) . Eligible veteran randomly assign parallel group treatment 600 mg/day mifepristone placebo one week follow three month . Using statistical selection theory , propose determine whether 600 mg mifepristone yield sufficiently high proportion clinical responder one month warrant extensive definitive research part Phase III trial . Secondarily , seek determine effect dose mifepristone compare placebo trajectory CAPS score time addition rescue medication , well compare rate adverse event serious adverse event across three group . We also describe effect mifepristone several clinical parameter include PTSD symptomology , depression severity , sleep quality , functional impairment . Several measure neuroendocrine function also obtain explore relationship plasma cortisol ACTH level clinical response time addition rescue medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Novel approach treatment post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) veterans urgently need . This proposal seek test innovative approach , one involve careful pharmacological manipulation body 's major stress system , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , use dose level FDA-approved drug , mifepristone ( 600 mg/day ) . We therefore seek examine effect glucocorticoid receptor antagonist , mifepristone ( MifeprexÂ® ) , clinical cognitive outcome veteran posttraumatic stress disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject male combat veteran . Veteran meet DSMIV diagnostic criterion chronic PTSD precipitate combat another traumatic event occur military service . Veteran CAPS total score ( past month symptom status ) great equal 50 screening . Veteran free psychotropic medication ( minimum five halflives must elapse since veteran last take give psychotropic medication ) . Veteran recently continue engage maladaptive pattern alcohol/substance use and/or abuse ( define protocol ) . Veteran use potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ( fluconazole , ketoconazole , itraconazole , erythromycin , rifampin ) inducer within five halflives prior randomization . Veteran take simvastatin , lovastatin , fentanyl , pimozide , bupropion , nefazodone , dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , quinidine , sirolimus , tacrolimus , clarithromycin , cyclosporine , St. John 's Wort , diltiazem , verapamil , propranolol , carvedilol anticonvulsant ( phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine ) within five halflives prior randomization . Veteran take oral corticosteroidswithin five halflives prior randomization . Veteran free major medical illness medical condition contraindicate administration mifepristone . These include limited : 1 . Veteran history adrenal insufficiency morning plasma cortisol level le 5 mcg/dl screening . 2 . Veteran history severe traumatic brain injury , history stroke , another neurological illness injury likely impact cognitive functioning . 3 . Veteran diabetes mellitus , endocrinopathy , another major medical illness . 4 . Veteran history cardiovascular disease include history angina , myocardial infarction evidence coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure 5 . Veteran prolong QTc interval &gt; 450 msec ECG screening . 6 . Veteran hypokalemia screening ( defined potassium level &lt; 3.5 mEq/L ) 7 . Veteran history hepatobiliary disease AST , ALT great 1.5X ULN . 8 . Veteran history renal disease estimate GFR &lt; 70 ml/min . Veteran lifetime diagnosis schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , type I bipolar disorder . Veteran history attempt suicide within previous two year active suicidal ideation within past month assess ColumbiaSuicide Severity Rating Scare ( CSSRS ) . Veteran currently receive specialize traumafocused psychotherapy . Veteran willing use effective mean birth control study . Veteran history allergic reaction mifepristone . Veteran find unsuitable study participation discretion site investigator reason , include clinical impression veteran would unable remain free standard pharmacotherapy least one month .</criteria>
