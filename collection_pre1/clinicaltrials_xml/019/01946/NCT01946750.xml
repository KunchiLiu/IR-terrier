	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : antibody direct certain antigen Clostridium difficile would predict Clostridium difficile infection . This study evaluate weight immunity study patient Clostridium difficile infection versus control ( patient associate two control : diarrheal control without Clostridium difficile , non-diarrheal control without Clostridium difficile ) . Recurrence kinetics immune response follow infection Clostridium difficile study follow patient three month . There also build biological sample collection clinically document : serum , stool strain .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>CASES : Inclusion criterion case : Hospitalized patient clinical sign Clostridium Difficile Infection specific detection stool Clostridium Difficile toxin or/and isolate stool digestive biopsy strain producer Clostridium Difficile toxin . Patients serum prior episode Clostridium Difficile Infection , ideally far possible episode , least 6 day day diagnosis ( D0 ) available . Patients consent sign legal representative default . Patients find Clostridium Difficile Infection file surgical Clostridium Difficile Infection reason admission include study subject separate analysis , witness . Exclusion criterion case : Eligible patient Clostridium Difficile Infection strongly suspect clinically microbiological confirmation obtain . Eligible patient previous serum recover accord criterion condition . The availability serum correspond patient 's admission optional exclusion criterion . Eligible patient ( legal representative ) oppose use sample , achieve sample and/or longitudinal followup . Eligible patient underwent plasmapheresis treat monoclonal antibody toxin A B immunoglobulin year precede episode Clostridium Difficile Infection . Eligible patient already include study recent infection Clostridium Difficile transfer second health facility episode Clostridium Difficile Infection . Eligible patient whose physician responsible management refuse participation study . Protected person : pregnant woman child age 18 . Secondarily exclude follow case : Patients sample achieve retained laboratory Medical Biology participate diagnosis monitoring patient . Hospitalized patient time Clostridium Difficile Infection suspicion diagnostic sample release transfer render necessary microbiological result baseline ( J0 J3 ) . Matched control case exclude exclude . NONDIARRHEAL CONTROL : Eligible patient diarrhea time recruitment . To ensure exposure risk similar case control ( hospitalization , usually care epidemic period , ... ) recruit eligible patient accord follow criterion : Within maximum period six month inclusion case . Hospitalized hospitalization service type case . With duration prior hospitalization least long time admission correspond case J0 , Matched sex three age category ( 1840 , 4160 &gt; 60 year ) . The inclusion control depend one hand signing inform consent participation study secondly lack clinical sign suggestive Clostridium Difficile Infection time inclusion know history Clostridium Difficile Infection medical record ( one nodiarrheal control hospitalize ( ND ) one case ) .</criteria>
