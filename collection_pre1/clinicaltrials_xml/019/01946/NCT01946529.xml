	<brief_summary>This protocol study treatment Ewing sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) desmoplastic small round cell tumor ( DSRCT ) . Participants ESFT divide two treatment group , A B , base tumor characteristic . Group A ( standard risk ) participant tumor pelvis , spread part body , less 14 year age . Because previous clinical trial show standard treatment effective child whose tumor characteristic , participant receive standard treatment . Group B ( high risk ) participants 14 year age old tumor pelvis , tumor spread part body . Participants DSRCT abdomen and/or pelvis tumor remove surgery alone spread part body include Group B . Participants group consider high risk great chance tumor recur follow standard treatment currently use . All participant follow evaluated 10 year follow completion therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To estimate response rate two initial course temsirolimus , temozolomide irinotecan previously untreated patient high-risk Ewing sarcoma family tumor ( ESFT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To estimate overall survival progression-free survival participant ESFT treat approach . - To estimate time progression participant ESFT treat Group B ( high risk ) . - To estimate cumulative incidence local failure follow local control paradigm trial . Group A : Participants receive interval compress ( every 2 week ) alternate course chemotherapy vincristine , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ( VDC ) ifosfamide etoposide ( IE ) . Doxorubicin omit follow total cumulative dose 375 mg/m^2 . Local control measure ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) institute 6 course chemotherapy . Total duration treatment approximately 29 week . Group B : Participants eligible window therapy receive two course ( 21 day duration ) mTOR inhibitor , temsirolimus , combination temozolomide irinotecan . Irinotecan ( 20 mg/m^2 ) administer IV protract schedule daily 5 day , 2 day , repeat daily x 5 [ ( qdx5 ) x2 ] , temozolomide ( 100 mg/m^2 ) PO daily x 5 day temsirolimus 35 mg/m^2 IV weekly day 1 8 . Following window treatment ( week 1 - 6 ) , participant proceed induction chemotherapy ( week 7 - 33 ) consist interval compress ( every 2 week ) alternate course chemotherapy vincristine , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ( VDC ) ifosfamide etoposide ( IE ) . Doxorubicin omit follow total cumulative dose 375 mg/m^2 . Local control measure ( surgery and/or radiation therapy ) institute 6 course induction chemotherapy ( week 19 ) . Participants whose tumor respond window therapy receive temsirolimus , temozolomide irinotecan week 29 31 place ifosfamide etoposide . Following induction therapy , participant receive six 21-day course maintenance therapy consist bevacizumab IV day 1 daily oral sorafenib low-dose cyclophosphamide day 1 day 21 .</detailed_description>
