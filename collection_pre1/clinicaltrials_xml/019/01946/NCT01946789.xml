	<criteria>ENTRY CRITERIA : DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histological cytological confirm malignancy follow disease group : melanoma metastatic unresectable , nonsmall cell lung carcinoma , renal cell carcinoma squamous cell head neck carcinoma , standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective . Primary site may cutaneous unknown , mucosal ocular primary exclude . Patients nonsmall lung cancer must prior EGFR ALK test . Patients sensitize mutation EGFR ALK rearrangement treat prior target agent progression discontinue due toxicity agent . No patient know brain metastasis . PRIOR/CONCURRENT THERAPY : At least one prior therapy use agent potential prolong remission . Patients BRAF v600 mutation exclude may include experience progression follow treatment BRAF inhibitor regimen consent forgo FDAapproved therapy increase median survival . At least 4 week last dose prior chemotherapy immunomodulator therapy full recovery acute toxicity . For patient come molecularlytargeted therapy , least 2 week since last dose recovery laboratory constitutional toxicity . At least 2 week completion prior radiation therapy full recovery toxicity . At least 4 week last dose prior investigational therapy recovery meet baseline eligibility criterion . Not receive current anticancer therapy No patient chemotherapy , target therapy , radiotherapy recover acute toxicity pretreatment baseline grade 1 level within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study . For resolution autoimmune toxicity prior immune therapy , patient must steroids least 30 day without relapse autoimmune toxicity , must least 30 day last dose infliximab relate immunosuppressive therapy without relapse autoimmune toxicity . No patient receive investigational agent . No patient receive chronic systemic regular inhale corticosteroid use within 7 day prior initiation protocol therapy . No immunosuppressive therapy within 30 day prior treatment start . PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS Age &gt; 18 year Both men woman race ethnic group eligible . Performance Status ECOG performance status ≤1 Life expectancy great 6 month . Bone Marrow Function leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL ( without hematopoietic growth factor ) platelet ≥100,000/mcL ( without transfusion ) hemoglobin ≥ 10 gm/dL ( may transfuse must stable without clinical evidence ongoing blood loss hemolysis ) Hepatic Function total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal Kidney Function Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . Pulmonary Function • No history severe COPD emphysema interstitial lung disease currently home supplemental oxygen . Patients NSCLC stable COPD emphysema require supplemental oxygen eligible . Cardiac Function No symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia . Patients underlie risk factor cardiac disease exclude undergo clearance stressbased cardiac function test . The pretreatment QTc must &lt; 500 msec . No class II great congestive heart failure describe New York Heart Association Functional Classification criterion serious arrhythmia likely increase risk cardiac complication cytokine therapy . Other Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document .
