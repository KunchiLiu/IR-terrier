	<brief_title>S1204 , Viral Screening Newly Diagnosed Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective Among newly diagnose cancer patient present SWOG-affiliated community academic oncology clinic , estimate prevalence human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B ( HBV ) , hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection . Prevalence estimate stratify : whether infection virus ( es ) know , report patient and/or physician prior study test , vs. unknown ; present cancer type , self-reported risk factor virus . Secondary Objectives - Evaluate know sociodemographic , clinical , behavioral factor significantly associate previously undiagnosed HIV , HBV , and/or HCV infection population people newly diagnose cancer . - Among patient identify HIV , HBV , and/or HCV , evaluate timing type treatment receive , viral infection cancer . - Evaluate type rate cancer treatment-related adverse event patient HIV , HBV , and/or HCV infection . - Using simulation model directly inform data obtain study , determine cost-effectiveness ( express cost per infection detect cost per year life gain ) ( 1 ) routine , universal screening ( 2 ) risk factor-directed screen newly diagnose cancer patient HIV , HBV , and/or HCV vs. current care . Tertiary Objective Create biorepository store serum future translational medicine study may include identify genomic viral factor increase risk serious adverse effect among participant infect HIV , HBV , and/or HCV treat invasive cancer .</detailed_description>
