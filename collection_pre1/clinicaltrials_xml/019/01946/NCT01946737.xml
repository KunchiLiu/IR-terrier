	<brief_summary>CT technology evolve rapid pace , introduction multidetector row CT scanner ( MDCT ) electrocardiographic ( ECG ) gate result increase number heart scan CTCA ( CT Coronary Angiography ) . CTCA provide noninvasive alternative conventional invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) , consider gold standard investigation coronary disease . There gradual increase utilization CTCA primary assessment low intermediate risk patient . However concern regard radiation exposure diagnostic accuracy , especially highrisk group , prevent widespread dissemination . To achieve best possible temporal resolution ( minimize cardiac motion artifact ) spatial resolution ( provide diagnostic accuracy ) relatively high radiation exposure require , result inverse relationship image noise resolution . However radiation ( X-ray ) associate increase risk cancer expose patient therefore essential continually devise strategy reduce radiation exposure whilst maintain image quality . A state-of-art CT scanner ( Discovery CT750 HD , General Electric ( GE ) Healthcare ) , instal Derriford hospital research CTCA . It use novel method scanning , High Definition Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography ( HD-CTCA ) , analogous high definition television ) image reconstruction ( Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction ASIR ) oppose conventional CT scanner use Filtered Back Projection ( FBP ) reconstruction . HD-CTCA enables acquisition sharper image ASIR offset resultant increase radiation exposure . This likely result image higher diagnostic quality equivalent slightly low radiation exposure compare present technology . Although initial result encouraging , needs assessment apply routine clinical practice . To assess design study perform HD-CTCA 300 consecutive patient undergo diagnostic ICA Derriford hospital , directly compare accuracy HD-CTCA ICA ( presently consider gold standard ) . Hypotheses : There significant difference sensitivity specificity HD-CTCA detection coronary artery stenosis 50 % great compare conventional ICA .</brief_summary>
