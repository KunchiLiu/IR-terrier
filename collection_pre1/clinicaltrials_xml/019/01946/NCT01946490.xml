	<detailed_description>A large group non-small cell lung cancer patient treat radiotherapy .

The hypothesis study : 1 . The diagnostic delay NSCLC patient increase last 12 year . 2 . The preparation time radiotherapy NSCLC patient increase last 12 year . 3 . Prolonged wait time associated bad overall survival outcome . The IKL collect data wait time treatment NSCLC patient treat 2001 2004 . These data use project . In addition , MAASTRO lung database contain information patient treat 2006 2010 . Additional information diagnostic procedure radiation treatment preparation collect review patient chart . For study data request submit IKL access MAASTRO patient data ( chart EMD ) need . The investigator aim collect follow variable : Date consultation pulmonologist ; Date multidisciplinary meeting ; Date first consultancy radiotherapy ; Date start radiotherapy ; Information diagnostic procedure ( PET/CT/Pathology/EBUS/EUS ) ; Information RT procedure ( 3Dconventional/IMRT ) ; General patient characteristic ; Overall survival</detailed_description>
