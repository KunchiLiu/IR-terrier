	<brief_summary>During period rehabilitation important select meaningful test ; measure want , responsive change patient 's condition , easy use clinical setting . With amputee test may help make sure rehabilitation programme prosthesis ( artificial leg ) provide tailor individual . New prosthetic technology continually develop active amputee demand artificial limb . Making sure get right rehabilitation programme appropriate prosthesis help perform best . Thirty amputees recently undergone low limb amputation recruit study . They ask complete 2 walking test 4 questionnaire measure different aspect recovery comfort socket perceive ability undertake everyday task . Each test give score grade represent level ability , judge test , give time point . The test repeat one three week delivery prosthesis , discharge hospital 6 week post-discharge . By measure change score across time point , also amputees feel change , hop determine responsive test objective measure change amputee ability also whether test sensitive change felt amputee . If show accurately link change score change amputee ability Physiotherapy treatment programme could accurately tailor individual amputee .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome Measures Lower Limb Amputees - A Rehabilitation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Outcome Measures ( test ) use study identify survey Health Professionals across UK . The top 5 use : SIGAM Mobility Grades The Special Interest Group Amputee Medicine ( SIGAM ) Mobility Grades describe single-item scale comprise six clinical grade ( A -F ) amputee mobility . A self-reported questionnaire 21 yes/no item answer apply algorithm final clinical grade assign . Timed go ( TUAG ) The TUAG test standardise quantitative measure manoeuvre require 'basic mobility ' . The subject time stand chair , walk 3m , turn return chair . The score simply time take complete circuit . Timed Walk Test A walk test often use measure functional exercise capacity . Participants instruct walk end end enclose quiet corridor , cover much ground possible allotted time period . The primary outcome interest distance walk , velocity also calculate . Locomotor Capability Index , basic ( LCI ) advance ( LCI-5 ) The Locomotor Capability Index ( LCI ) self-administered scale specifically design use lower limb amputee . It 14 question locomotor activity . The answer require either yes question phrase : `` Would say able follow activity prosthesis ? '' The LCI sub-divided 2 subscales : basic advanced . The total score activity total possible maximum score 42 ( basic ) 56 ( advance ) . Socket Comfort Score This score simple subjective measure comfortable amputee feel socket time score take . Amputees ask standard question : 'On 0 - 10 scale , 0 represent uncomfortable socket fit imagine , 10 represent comfortable socket fit , would score comfort socket fit artificial limb moment ? '' Their response 11 point scale record . Finally EQ-5D™ administer study visit . The EQ-5D™ self-administered , standardised instrument measure health outcome . It provide simple descriptive profile single index health status . In addition Activity Change Questionnaire give participant gather information participant feel ability perform everyday task change , , previous time . They ask use assessment categories `` much bad '' , `` slightly bad '' , `` equal '' , `` slightly good '' `` much good '' . At first Study Visit ( SV1 ) write consent obtain amputee Researcher amputee enrol study participant . Baseline measurement test also take visit well basic demographic data record age , cause amputation , level amputation relevant concomitant medical history . Study Visit 2 ( SV2 ) occur 2 week follow SV1 test repeat . A change questionnaire also give participant record 5 point Likert scale feel ability perform everyday task change compare SV1 . A second set test score collect sub-set participant time point approximately 24 hour first score investigate reliability measure acute rehabilitation period . Study Visit 3 ( SV3 ) occur week participant discharge hospital . Discharges hospital plan advance therefore anticipate visit likely 3-5 day prior actual discharge hospital . The test repeat visit . However , discharge occurs within 1 week SV2 test repeat score obtain SV2 use calculation . The last Study Visit ( SV4 ) occur 6 week follow discharge hospital , coincide participant 6 week post-discharge multi-disciplinary team clinic appointment Southeast Mobility Rehabilitation Technology ( SMART ) Centre adjacent Physiotherapy Department Astley Ainslie Hospital . The test repeat visit . A change questionnaire also give record participant feel ability perform everyday task change compare SV3 . A question add ask feel ability perform everyday task change compare SV1 . Every effort make complete test time day participant 's study visit order measurement randomly assign visit . The change score test record three time period . Time period 1 ( T1 ) , SV1 SV2 , represent early stage prosthetic limb rehabilitation . Time period 2 ( T2 ) , SV1 SV3 ( SV2 SV3 do ) , represent period in-patient rehabilitation . The limitation T2 length stay variable patient therefore use primary outcome analysis . Time period 3 ( T3 ) , SV3 ( SV2 SV3 do ) SV4 , represent time period immediately follow discharge .</detailed_description>
