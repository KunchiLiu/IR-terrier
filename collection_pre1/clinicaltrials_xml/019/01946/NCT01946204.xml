	<brief_title>A Study Apalutamide ( ARN-509 ) Men With Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 clinical trial essential step evaluation investigational medication see may useful treat prostate cancer . The purpose SPARTAN study compare safety effectiveness investigational medication placebo delay prostate cancer spread part body . A placebo pill look like investigational medication contain active medication , dummy pill . Phase 3 study perform preliminary evidence suggest effectiveness drug obtain previous Phase 2 study . These study intend gather additional information effectiveness safety need evaluate overall benefit-risk relationship drug . Study participant take oral investigational medication daily . One cycle study treatment last 4 week 28 day . The number cycle depend cancer respond study medication . In order researcher evaluate compare study result , two different study group . Study participant randomly ( like flip coin ) assign one group : - One group receive current treatment along investigational medication - One group receive current medication along placebo The investigational medication give 2 every 3 study participant . Neither study staff know group . However , case medical emergency , study doctor quickly find treatment group . All participant continue receive current treatment along either investigational medication placebo . The selection random , may remain investigational treatment disease worsens , significant side effect occur long tolerate treatment .</detailed_description>
