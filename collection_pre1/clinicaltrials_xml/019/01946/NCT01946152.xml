	<brief_title>Study Pomalidomide Dexamethasone With Growth Factor Support Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 7 group 6 participant enrol Part 1 study 19 participant enrol Part 2 . Induction Phase : If enrol Part 1 , dose pomalidomide receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level pomalidomide . Each new group receive high dose pomalidomide group , intolerable side effect see . Up 7 dose level study . If enrol Part 2 , receive pomalidomide high dose tolerate Part 1 . All participant receive dose level dexamethasone filgrastim . The induction phase last 6 cycle . Maintenance Phase : After Cycle 6 , participant part enter maintenance phase . You receive low dose pomalidomide receive induction . You receive dose level dexamethasone receive induction . You receive filgrastim maintenance phase . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . During Induction : - You take pomalidomide mouth Days 1-21 . - You take dexamethasone mouth Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . - You receive filgrastim needle skin Days 22-28 . During Maintenance : - You take pomalidomide mouth Days 1-21 every cycle . - You take dexamethasone mouth Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 every cycle . If miss dose pomalidomide , take soon day . If miss day completely , make dose next day . If take prescribe dose pomalidomide , seek emergency medical care , need , contact study doctor right away . Pomalidomide take without food , least 2 hour 2 hour meal . You caregiver give instruction administer filgrastim injection home . Study Visits : Induction Phase : On Day 1 Cycles 1-6 : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect check status disease . If urine collect , collect urine 24-hour period . You provide container collect urine . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1-6 : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . Maintenance Phase : On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect check status disease . If urine collect , collect urine 24-hour period . You provide container collect urine . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration check status disease . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . - If find plasmacytoma screening , may CT scan , PET/CT scan , MRI measure . If MD Anderson , routine blood draw do regular doctor 's office . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete long-term follow-up . End-of-Study Drug Visit : After finish taking study drug : - You physical exam . - You neurological exam . - You EKG . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test check thyroid . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) and/or urine collect check status disease . If urine collect , collect urine 24-hour period . You provide container collect urine . - If doctor think need , x-rays entire body check bone fracture tumor bone . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . - If find plasmacytoma screening , may CT scan , PET/CT scan , MRI measure . Long Term Follow-Up : After end-of-study drug visit , call every 3 month 1 year every 6 month see . These call take 2-3 minute . This investigational study . Pomalidomide FDA approve commercially available treatment multiple myeloma patient whose disease gotten bad within 60 day receive least 2 prior therapy ( include lenalidomide bortezomib ) .The combination pomalidomide , dexamethasone , filgrastim treat MM investigational . The study doctor explain study drug ( ) design work . Up 55 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
