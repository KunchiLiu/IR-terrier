	<brief_summary>The BTP ( Breakthrough pain ) define `` transient exacerbation pain occur either spontaneously , relation specific predictable unpredictable trigger , despite relatively stable adequately control background pain '' . The BTP common clinical feature patient cancer pain ( BTcP : breakthrough cancer pain ) . The prevalence BTcP equal 56 % . Currently , investigator tend recognize idiopathic/spontaneous accident BTcP three sub-types : voluntary , non- voluntary procedural . The diagnosis BTCP always easy cancer patient normal observe change intensity pain day , necessary differentiate slight fluctuation presence real episode BTCP , necessary use rescue treatment adjust . In study propose use diagnostic algorithm , present literature , perform diagnosis BTCP . In presence BTCP , important correct control background pain major opioids , reduce number intensity painful episode , implement adjunctive therapy , call `` rescue '' , administer time take painful episode use , case , opioid great .</brief_summary>
