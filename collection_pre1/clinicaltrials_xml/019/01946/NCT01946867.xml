	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cancers oral cavity represent 30 % head neck carcinoma western world . The oropharynx posterior continuation oral cavity connects nasopharynx ( ) laryngopharynx ( ) . It also frequent site primary head neck cancer . These structure play crucial role swallowing , breath speech . Locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer obstruct air flow infiltrate muscle nerve , significantly disturb local function . The incidence Head Neck Squamous Cell Cancer patient older 65 year high , 47 % occur population record Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Results registry United States . Regarding therapeutic strategy , association radiotherapy chemotherapy biologics demonstrate significant improvement outcome drawback high toxicity , demonstrate 2 meta-analyses , without survival improvement old patient . NBTXR3 radiation therapy may increase cancer cell kill complete tumor shrinkage allow definitive treatment preservation local structure function patient older 65 year , receive cisplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NBTXR3 Crystalline Nanoparticles Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma Oral Cavity Oropharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive single administration NBTXR3 day 1 , either intra-arterial intratumor injection , follow Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy start 24 hour later ( day 2 ) , completion 7 week , i.e . 70 Grays , 2Grays/fraction . Patients whose tumor completely shrunk follow post-radiotherapy evaluation End Treatment visit . Those patient whose tumor shrink 50 % baseline size , stop radiotherapy may salvage tumor surgery . Then , patient follow every 8 week , safety evaluation cancer disease status end study .</detailed_description>
