	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study anal human papillomavirus ( HPV ) test screen cell change anus patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Screening test may help doctor find cancer cell early plan well treatment anal cancer . Completing multiple screening test may help find best method detect cell change anus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anal HPV Tests Screening Cell Changes Anus Patients With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine sensitivity specificity HPV test use different method detection , include HPV Hybrid Capture 2 ( HC2 ) , HPV messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) assay ( APTIMA ) OncoHealth HPV E6/E7 oncoprotein assay whether improve screen performance routine anal cytology detection anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) measure gold standard , biopsy-proven HSIL . II . To determine prevalence risk factor prevalent HSIL HIV-infected woman . III . To determine incidence risk factor associate anal HSIL HPV 2 year among HIV infect woman undergo semi-annual anal evaluation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate acceptability anal cancer screen among HIV-infected woman . II . To collect data quality life health care cost ( include non-direct health care cost time cost ) economic evaluation cost-effectiveness anal cancer screen strategy HIV-positive woman . OUTLINE : Patients undergo screen detection HSIL use anal cytology , HPV hybrid capture 2 , HPV mRNA assay , OncoHealth HPVE6/E7 oncoprotein baseline , 12 24 month .</detailed_description>
