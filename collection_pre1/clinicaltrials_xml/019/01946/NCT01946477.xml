	<brief_summary>This trial evaluate efficacy safety combination pomalidomide ( POM ) low-dose dexamethasone ( LD-Dex ) ( Cohort A ) combination pomalidomide ( POM ) , daratumumab ( DARA ) low-dose dexamethasone ( LD-Dex ) ( Cohort B ) subject relapse refractory multiple myeloma receive first second line treatment lenalidomide-based therapy . This trial test hypothesis Cohort A proportion patient Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) &gt; 30 % reveal Pomalidomide efficacious pretreated patient refractory lenalidomide . This trial test hypothesis Cohort B proportion patient Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) &gt; 70 % reveal POM+DARA+LD-Dex efficacious pretreated patient refractory lenalidomide .</brief_summary>
