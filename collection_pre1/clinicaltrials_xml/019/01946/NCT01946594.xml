	<brief_summary>The study team aim conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled , pilot study assess effect prophylactic antipyretic immune response rate fever inactivate influenza vaccine ( IIV ) child 12 35 month age . In pilot , 40 healthy child , 12 35 month age , include child risk febrile seizure , randomize receive prophylactic acetaminophen oral placebo immediately follow every 4 6 hour 24 hour receipt dose IIV . Data derive pilot study use assess feasibility conduct large scale study . Feasibility include assessment speed ease study recruitment adherence completion study assessment . Children follow occurrence fever , fussiness , change appetite sleep pattern , use medical service day day follow vaccination . Antibody influenza antigen contain 2013-2014 vaccine measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody assess baseline four week follow vaccination . The proportion child experience fever , solicit reaction , use medical service , demonstrate serologic response correspond seroprotection seroconversion IIV antigen determine group child receive acetaminophen placebo . Likewise geometric mean HAI titer ( GMT ) correspond 95 % confidence interval IIV antigen calculate vaccine group .</brief_summary>
