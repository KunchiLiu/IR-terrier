	<brief_summary>The anorectal manometry gold standard evaluation anorectal function . Several technique currently use ( balloon , perfuse catheter ) always perform supine position . Few study report evaluation sphincter function upright position , whereas symptoms fecal incontinence occur position . Recently develop , high-resolution manometry , thanks many mechanical sensor , allow topographic analysis evaluation anorectal function acurate . In addition , rigid nature probe allow stability measure / record , possible probe perfuse catheter example . We therefore propose compare anal sphincter pressure supine standing , measure high-resolution manometry .</brief_summary>
