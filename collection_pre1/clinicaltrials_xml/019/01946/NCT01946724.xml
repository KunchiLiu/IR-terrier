	<brief_title>In-hospital Long-term Outcomes Percutaneous Chronic Total Coronary Occlusion Revascularization High-volume , Multi-operator Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study study whether percutaneous chronic total occlusion ( CTO ) revascularization , use Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) , stenting , guidewire , catheter , improve patient 's quality life leave ventricular function , reduce angina severity , improve long-term survival . The study consist two follow group : Retrospective patient This group consist consecutive patient already undergone CTO PCI PHI CTO team . - The patient contact telephone inform consent ask feel see doctor heart condition . The patient also ask take antiplatelet medicine prescribe , change medicine . - If 12 month pass since procedure , patient query regard medical history - If patient contact , analysis data limit de-identified data collect chart , procedure angiogram , procedure report . Prospective patient This group consist patient CTO procedure perform PHI CTO team . - A clinical assessment perform stent procedure - A blood sample take routine blood chemistry hematology - Medications prescribe prevent blood clot - Follow-up occur 6 12 month post-procedure</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The subject &gt; 18 year age time consent 2 . Subjects experience clinical symptom consider suggestive ischemic heart disease ( eg , chest pain discomfort symptom consider investigator represent anginal equivalent ) evidence myocardial ischemia ( eg , abnormal functional study ) attribute CTO target vessel schedule clinically indicate percutaneous CTO revascularization subject multivessel disease and/or Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) undergo stag CTO PCI procedure intent achieve complete revascularization . 3 . Subject must least 1 target segment meeting nonacute total coronary occlusion define . A CTO nonacute total coronary occlusion fulfil follow angiographic characteristic : 1 . Highgrade native coronary stenosis 2 . Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) 0 1 antegrade flow 3 . Estimated duration least 3 month clinical history and/or comparison antecedent angiogram , functional study electrocardiogram 4 . CTO segment may de novo previously treat via PCI 4 . Subject eligible consent undergo undergone PCI procedure 5 . Subject acceptable candidate percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) stenting . 6 . Subject willing able provide inform consent approve local Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee complete protocol requirement study . 7 . Female subject childbearing potential negative qualitative quantitative pregnancy test accordance Piedmont Hospital Policy . 1 . Any known allergy , hypersensitivity contraindication iodinate contrast effectively manage medically 2 . Any known allergy , hypersensitivity contraindication clopidogrel bisulfate ( Plavix® ) , prasugrel ( Effient® ) ticagrelor ( Brilinta® ) alternative agent use aspirin , heparin , nickel , stainless steel , zotarolimus , everolimus 3 . Any contraindication cardiac catheterization standard concomitant therapy use routine cardiac catheterization PCI 4 . Subjects pathology indication opinion investigator , might put subject risk , preclude followup , way confound result study 5 . Known previous medical condition yielding expect survival less one year 6 . Subjects unable unwilling comply protocol expect complete study period , include followup requirement 7 . Subjects evidence ongoing active clinical instability include follow : 1 . Sustained systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg ( different baseline ) cardiogenic shock 2 . Acute pulmonary edema medically stabilize 3 . Suspected acute myocarditis , pericarditis , endocarditis , cardiac tamponade 4 . Suspected dissect aortic aneurysm 8 . Subjects know clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding include : 1 . White Blood Cells ( &lt; 1,000 WBC/mm3 ) 2 . Thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 100,000 platelets/mm3 ) 9 . Subjects history bleed diathesis coagulapathy refusal blood transfusion 10 . Female subject childbearing potential positive qualitative quantitative pregnancy test negative qualitative quantitative pregnancy test plan become pregnant within 12 month enrol study</criteria>
