	<brief_summary>Severe trauma induces massive metabolic change characterize hypermetabolism increase energy expenditure catabolism . Early enteral , necessary , parenteral feed major focus modern intensive care medicine . After acute spinal cord injury , denervation skeletal muscle lead massive loss muscle mass area level injury . This dramatic muscle atrophy lead decrease energy expenditure . Whereas survivor severe trauma typically regain muscle mass rehabilitation , spinal cord injury patient typically continue lose muscle mass time , also lead change body composition . The time course change know . Continuing nutrition without adaption reduce energy expenditure lead weight gain adiposity , expose many chronic spinal cord injury patient know unfavorable metabolic consequence . Knowledge time course change would help provide adequate caloric intake patient improve ability nutrition counseling . The investigator plan prospective clinical trial 25 acute spinal cord injury patient determine change energy expenditure body composition . Major inclusion criterion acute traumatic spinal cord injury , age 18-70 , neurological level L1 , AIS ( American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale ) A , B C. Measurements energy expenditure , body composition nutritional marker venous blood schedule 2 , 6 , 10 14 week spinal cord injury end rehabilitation ( late 26 week ) .</brief_summary>
