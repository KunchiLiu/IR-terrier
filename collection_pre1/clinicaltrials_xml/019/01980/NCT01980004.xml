	<brief_title>Potassium Citrate Supplementation vs. Dietary Counseling</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence kidney stone disease United States increase . Concurrently , increase calcium phosphate stone composition also observe . Recurrence kidney stone disease report high 50 % five year . Citrate supplementation widely consider one primary medical cornerstone decrease kidney stone recurrence . Urinary citrate potent inhibitor calcium stone formation bind ionic urinary calcium well direct inhibition calcium oxalate formation . Additionally , increase citrate , alkali , raise urine pH alters solubility certain stone type include uric acid cystine stone . Potassium citrate supplementation primary proven approach increase urinary citrate well-established preventive option stone disease . However , medication treatment cause epigastric discomfort , frequent large bowel movement add patient 's prescription financial burden . Dietary education include lemonade therapy provide natural dietary source citrate may alternative pharmacologic therapy without associate gastrointestinal symptom cost . The utility citrate supplementation previously evaluate prospectively calcium phosphate stone former . Calcium phosphate stone formation occur alkaline urine environment . It postulate citrate supplementation could promote calcium phosphate stone occurrence due ability raise urine pH despite inhibitory effect increase urinary citrate . However , find observe limited retrospective study . The purpose investigation prospectively evaluate benefit citrate supplementation either potassium citrate treatment dietary education vs. dietary education alone reduce stone recurrence calcium phosphate stone former risk factor .</detailed_description>
