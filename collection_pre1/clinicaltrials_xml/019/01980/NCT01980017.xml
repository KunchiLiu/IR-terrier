	<brief_summary>The incidence type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) increase rapidly . The combination T2DM smoke particularly lethal , smoker T2DM significantly likely develop number health related complication . Community-based diabetes education program ( DEPs ) develop support patient self-care behaviour ( e.g . adherence oral medication , insulin therapy , nutrition management , regular blood glucose monitoring , physical activity ) ; however , specific assistance smoking cessation rarely provide . Our investigative team develop knowledge transfer practice change process introduce evidence-based intervention smoke cessation clinical practice setting . This process know Ottawa Model Smoking Cessation ( OMSC ) . Investigators believe opportunity use OMSC intervention dramatically enhance effectiveness DEPs address smoke cessation among smoker T2DM , , improve quit rate high risk population . The purpose project evaluate effectiveness Ottawa Model Smoking Cessation ( OMSC ) intervention multiple diabetes education program ( DEPs ) Ontario . A two-level recruitment strategy employ . Eighteen DEPs recruit , consecutive sample eligible smoker-patients recruit DEP 6-month recruitment period . Investigators want test impact OMSC intervention quit rate among smoker diabetes pre-diabetes referred program . Investigators conduct matched-pair cluster design trial 18 DEPs Ontario . These site match base number annual referral diabetes education ( â‰¤ 500/year &gt; 500/year ) . Within pair , site allocate randomly either OMSC intervention control group . Following randomization , OMSC program implement intervention sit 6-month period . Following implementation period , consecutive sample smoker recruit OMSC intervention control DEPs 6-month recruitment period . It estimate yield sample approximately 445 smoker OMSC intervention control group . The primary outcome biochemically-validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate six month index visit DEP . Secondary outcome include : rate identification intervention smoker , diabetes educator ' attitude , confidence , perception barrier facilitator implement smoke cessation support part routine care . If proven effective , OMSC appropriate implementation DEPs across Canada could profound impact patient community health .</brief_summary>
