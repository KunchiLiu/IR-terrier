	<brief_summary>Title : How exercise improve calf muscle patient poor blood supply leg ? Purpose project : Patients peripheral arterial disease poor blood supply low leg . The reduced inflow prevents leg utilising nutrient oxygen easily healthy leg would . This cause pain walking ( intermittent claudication ) , often occur reproducible distance e.g . every 50 yard . These patient reduction quality life feel embarrassed social situation e.g . walk around town require multiple break , tend avoid isolate . One treatment claudication exercise pain come onÍ¾ reluctant . Walking three time week hour , double people 's walk distance , n't always . The reason improve exercise others remain unknown . This project first randomise control trial exercise claudicants focus adaptation occur muscle cellular level . We wish compare muscle cell group exercise group . We focus change muscle cell size function present , later progress happens . Methods : We take measurement start study ( baseline ) , 6 week 3 , 6 12 month . These measurement patient 's fitness , actual walking distance blood sample . At time surgery , muscle calf take affected leg . This process University 's biomedical science department look different type muscle fibre efficiently work .</brief_summary>
