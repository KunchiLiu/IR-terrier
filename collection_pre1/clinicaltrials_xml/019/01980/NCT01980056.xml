	<brief_title>Vosaroxin Intermediate 2 High-risk MDS After Failure With Hypomethylating Agent-based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1-2 , dose escalation study safety clinical activity vosaroxin subject INT-2 high risk MDS fail prior hypomethylating agent base therapy . The study utilize standard 3+3 design estimate MTD [ maximum tolerate dose ] vosaroxin administer subject MDS . MTD define high dose level 33 % subject observe give dose level experience DLT [ dose limit toxicity ] . Subjects assess safety DLT first cycle vosaroxin . Subjects enrol study cohort 3 . Three eligible subject enrol sequential cohort increase dose level least 1 DLT observe first cycle vosaroxin therapy . Subjects receive dos vosaroxin evaluate MTD , DLTs , safety profile first cycle therapy . Once MTD determine , expand evaluation safety hematologic response improvement rate dose level conduct additional subject total number subject expose dose level 15 subject , inclusive treat dose level dose-escalation phase . The exposure additional subject MTD provide good estimate toxicity rate . Subjects document response Complete Response , Partial Response , hematologic improvement end Cycle 2 may continue receive vosaroxin additional cycle discretion treat investigator discussion medical staff Sunesis Pharmaceuticals . There 30-day follow-up period follow termination study drug treatment .</detailed_description>
