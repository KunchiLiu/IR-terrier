	<brief_summary>In research , investigator use non-invasive 1230 nm ultra-fast laser light source , utilize non-linear light microscopic system observe skin . This microscopic system successfully developed Graduate Institute Photonics Optoelectronics , National Taiwan University , commercialize yet . In past , observation technology perform skin five subject . The early stage skin clinical trial approve Research Ethics Committee National Taiwan University Hospital . After trial , test site subject evaluate dermatologist immediately , several hour , 24 hour , 3 day , 1 week . There inflammatory symptom , skin color change , pigmentation , wound , blister formation , ulceration report . According subject ' experience , felt discomfort experiment . After experiment , inflammatory symptom sign observe skin area . Therefore , preliminary trial show technology safe subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator invite join experiment January 2010 December 2016 . In research , investigator use non-invasive 1230 nm Cr : Forsterite laser light source , utilize harmonic-generation light microscopic system observe skin forearm lesion . During inspection process , please hold skin area inspect support device , suck disc microscope objective adopt stabilize site observe . Near-infrared light 1230 nm wavelength project skin , reflect imaging signal collect microscope . The investigator expose experimental skin area laser 30 minute . The power laser investigator use limit within 1.5W ( power ordinary light bulb 60-100W ) , total energy project skin 270J , equal total energy light bulb illuminate 3-5 second . After experiment , investigator examine inspect skin area immediately . The entire process around one two hour , include experiment explanation , laser exposure , evaluation health condition . If patient suspect melanoma , basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , already skin biopsy tumor remove surgery , without affect pathological diagnosis staging , investigator take 0.5x0.5x0.2cm3 chuck tumor surround normal skin specimen remove surgery observation harmonic-generation microscope . This process affect follow diagnosis therapy .</detailed_description>
