	<brief_summary>In pre-clinical study find thioredoxin reductase activity serum harbour huge difference cancer patient non-cancer patient , enzyme activity elevate remarkably among cancer patient , kind treatment serum thioredoxin reductase activity decline remarkably , hypothesis serum thioredoxin reductase activity could warn marker early progression first-line treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cooperative research project involve patient Medical Oncology Department Affiliated Cancer Hospital Xiangya School Medicine Central South University , State Key Laboratory Natural Medicine Biomimetic Drugs Perking University . The primary objective measure thioredoxin reductase activity use blood subject receive platinum base chemotherapy , study warn progression ability thioredoxin reductase blood . The secondary objective compare warn progression activity blood thioredoxin reductase reductase activity carcinoembryonic antigen subject receive platinum base first-line chemotherapy . Blood collect chemotherapy , every 2 cycle chemotherapy , every 3 month first-line chemotherapy till 2 year , every 6 month till 3 year , collect blood till tumor progression , evaluation CT result every time collect blood sample .</detailed_description>
