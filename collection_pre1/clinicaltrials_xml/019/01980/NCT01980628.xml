	<brief_title>Study Bruton 's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ibrutinib first-in-class , potent , orally administer covalent inhibitor Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) . Inhibition BTK block downstream B-cell receptor ( BCR ) signal pathway thus prevents B-cell proliferation . In vitro , ibrutinib inhibits purify BTK select member kinase family 10-fold specificity compare non-BTK kinase . Phase 1 2 study ibrutinib B-cell malignancy demonstrate modest toxicity significant single agent activity variety B-cell malignancy , include NHL .</detailed_description>
