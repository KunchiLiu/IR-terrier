	<brief_summary>Autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune chronic liver disease whose treatment include use immunosuppressive drug , particularly azathioprine , corticosteroid . When properly treat , patient good survival . One major problem relate treatment high rate relapse stop therapy lead biochemical histological remission , close 80 % . Many author recommend continuous treatment throughout life , result occurrence many side effect . Chloroquine drug anti-inflammatory property already use treatment extrahepatic autoimmune liver disease . There report literature beneficial use liver diseases chronic hepatitis B , pilot study patient autoimmune hepatitis , use associate 6.49 time low risk disease recurrence compare patient treatment discontinue remission .

	<brief_title>CHLOROQUINE FOR MAINTENANCE REMISSION OF AUTOIMMUNE HEPATITIS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoimmune hepatitis ( AIH ) chronic disease progressive destruction hepatic parenchyma , lead cirrhosis high mortality absence specific treatment . It demonstrate treatment corticosteroid azathioprine provide clinical laboratory improvement , reduction histological inflammatory activity liver biopsy increase survival . The life expectancy correctly treat patient approach age- gender-matched control . One feature AIH high rate recurrence discontinuation treatment patient achieve histological remission . The chance recurrence reach 50 % 6 month 70 % one year , rate sustain remission , limit 10 15 % 5 year . Thus , patient require maintenance treatment prevent recurrence . Chloroquine drug group 4-aminoquinolines , synthetic derivative quinine constituent bark Cinchona tree . Chloroquine accumulate tissue considerable amount . In animal , 200 700 time plasma concentration find liver , spleen , kidneys lung . As weak base , accumulate intracellularly , particularly lysosomes consequent increase pH within organelle , could contribute toxicity . Lysosomal lamellar body observe tissue affected chloroquine , retina neuromuscular system . Chloroquine inhibit absorption bind mitochondrial calcium , alters membrane permeability transport enzymes lysosomes . Apparently mechanisms explain anti-inflammatory action ; interference release TNF mononuclear phagocytes inhibit gene expression down-regulation TNF receptor , delay transport cellular surface . Due mechanism action , chloroquine anti-inflammatory activity therefore use disease rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus . In liver disease , chloroquine use patient hepatitis B normalization level aminotransferases prothrombin time treatment relapse drug discontinuation . Chloroquine also evaluate patient porphyria cutanea tarda despite clinical biochemical improvement , liver biopsy remain unchanged one year treatment . A previous pilot study perform institution , publish 2005 , chloroquine diphosphate maintenance treatment AIH . In study , 14 patient biochemical histological remission treat chloroquine diphosphate 250 mg/day least 12 month disease recurrence , compare 18 historical control , hold discontinuation treatment remission . The chance relapse 6.49 time higher historical control compare patient group treat chloroquine ( 72.2 % versus 23.5 % , p = 0.031 ) . The use chloroquine safe patient liver cirrhosis without decompensation , serious adverse event within two year use . The common adverse effect chloroquine mild transient gastrointestinal symptom , headache , dizziness , blurry vision fatigue . The severe reaction describe itch , cardiovascular manifestation , dyskinesia , eye injury , neuromuscular disorder hear loss . Among feared adverse effect chloroquine , eye injury , usually associate chronic treatment . They may consist change retina , lens , cornea optic nerve . Usually remain stable drug withdrawal , drug discontinue early stage . However , retinal damage increase find advanced stage , may progress even year cessation chloroquine . It believe chloroquine retinopathy prevent recognize early reversible stage judicious use , appropriate dos regular ophthalmologic follow-up . It recommend daily dose exceed 250 mg chloroquine diphosphate 400 mg hydroxychloroquine , ophthalmologic evaluation carry every 4 6 month . Despite adverse effect toxic reaction describe , consensus study chloroquine well tolerate drug , provide appropriate dosage guideline regular eye examination follow . With caution mind , use rarely cause serious side irreversible effect . The purpose study investigate whether chloroquine prevents risk recurrence AIH patient remission discontinuation conventional treatment , prospective , randomize , double-blind trial , evaluate occurrence side effect use chloroquine . To include patient satisfy follow criterion simultaneously : diagnosis probable / definite AIH ( accord criterion international AIH Group ) , normal liver function absence clinical sign decompensated liver disease ( ascites , hepatic encephalopathy , gastrointestinal bleeding hepatocellular carcinoma ) ; biochemical ( aminotransferase level within normal value least 18 month ) histological remission liver biopsy ( periportal inflammatory activity le 2 ) presence immunosuppressive treatment ; men non-pregnant woman woman intention become pregnant ; willing participate study . An explanation study make patient . For enrollment , necessary patient accordance propose study , follow precept Declaration Helsinki . If patient refuse participate study , treat follow traditional guideline service . We exclude patient stop drug six month side effect , patient 's desire loss follow . Treatment discontinue case pregnancy , patient 's desire , side-effects relapse AIH . Recurrence define sustained increase liver enzymes , great equal two time upper normal value ( accord criterion International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group ) . The sample size calculate exact Fisher test compare treatment placebo group consider relapse percentage vary 25 % 40 % 65 % 80 % , respectively . Thus , sample size obtain 30 128 patient group consider power 80 % statistical significance level 5 % . The statistical analysis present mean standard error quantitative variable percentage qualitative variable descriptive measure . The survival analysis perform , simple Cox regression multiple Cox regression treatment fix covariate , test effect treatment consider patient ' characteristic relapse risk begin treatment relapse period 3 year . In second step , survival analysis repeat patient finish stop treatment side effect verify absence relapse treatment due patient ' characteristic . Furthermore , proportion side effect compare group exact Fisher test . A p-value less 5 % consider statistical significance . Patients randomize receive placebo chloroquine , name drug A drug B . Information composition tablet keep secret Pharmacy 's staff Hospital da Clinicas , University Sao Paulo School Medicine . The treatment regimen lead histological remission maintain month , association drug A B , time withdrawal . Patients take ursodeoxycholic acid achieve remission remain use drug study . Drugs A B maintain disease recurrence ( persistent change aminotransferase great twice normal value ) three year biochemical test normal , time patient want remain study . If recurrence disease , patient exclude study receive treatment receive previously . All patient visit every 30 day first six month use drug A drug B monotherapy , routine blood test perform . After , consultation every two month . All complaint record number tablet count visit ass adherence account failure take medication . Every patient treat doctor responsible study , laboratory test perform Central Laboratory hospital protocol perform available online consultation . In case side effect , drug may stop request patient accord medical advice . All patient undergo initial ophthalmologic evaluation follow six-monthly evaluation . The drug withdrawal , change suggestive retinopathy observe . After end treatment , patient follow next five year due risk late onset retinopathy .</detailed_description>
