	<brief_title>Prospective Study Impact Sleeve Gastrectomy Gastro-esophageal Junction Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effectiveness sleeve gastrectomy gastric band gastric bypass . However , proportion patient undergo surgery , report troublesome persistent dysphagia , pain , new onset worsen gastro-esophageal reflux ( GER ) require treatment . Improved result sleeve gastrectomy could possible know surgical / mechanical factor affect outcome . Current investigation base traditional intra-luminal imaging ( endoscopy ) radiology ( UGI series ) may provide adequate preoperative assessment esophago-gastric dynamic . Current practice creation sleeve gastrectomy involve use bougie endoscope around sleeve staple . There consensus diameter bougie intraoperative calibration may alter gastro-esophageal junction ( GEJ ) anatomy , provide real time physiology feedback , allow rough approximation size sleeve provide information distensibility pressure gradient newly create gastric tube fill . A distensible sleeve lower intra-gastric pressure , thus theoretically expect reduce incidence side effect . As laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy perform increase frequency , need development tool assist surgeon model properly standardize gastroplasty . This study base strict assessment anatomical functional characteristic `` ideal `` gastric sleeve , use exist image modality ( endoscopy - CT scan- MRI - HRM ) .</detailed_description>
