	<brief_summary>The propose study carefully test hypothesis robust dose baclofen ( 90 mg/day ) efficacy safe individual alcohol dependence . Furthermore , proposal test whether indicator physical dependence , i.e . drinks/drinking day , predict response baclofen . Additionally , proposal examine anti-anxiety effect baclofen within alcohol dependent population ascertain whether baseline level anxiety predict response baclofen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety High Dose Baclofen Alcohol Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol dependence ( AD ) common problem significant health consequence . Treatment AD evolve include counsel method medication . Several medication discover , show efficacy AD , e.g . naltrexone , acamprosate . However , overall effect exist medication modest leave clear need development new pharmacotherapies . The gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) -B receptor agonist baclofen attract attention potential new medication AD base preclinical data early clinical trial . Baclofen FDA approve medication excellent safety profile even patient liver cirrhosis—a uncommon consequence AD . Questions arise regard efficacy baclofen whether high dos baclofen safe effective prior test dose 30 mg/ day . There emerge evidence severity dependence positively associate baclofen response . The main goal present proposal test efficacy safety 30 mg/d 90 mg/d baclofen compare placebo control severity dependence assess drinks/drinking day . A primary secondary goal examine anxiolytic effect baclofen . The study propose enroll 120 men woman AD randomize , placebo-controlled trial include least 60 individual severe AD ( ≥14 drinks/drinking day men ; ≥10 drinks/drinking day woman ) randomization baclofen placebo balance variable . Baclofen titrate 10 mg t.i.d 3 day 30 mg t.i.d 12 day maintain level 12 week downtitrated total study time 16 week . Medical Management provide encourage progress towards drinking goal enhance retention compliance . Drinking pattern , anxiety level , sleep pattern , crave alcohol , gamma-glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) carbohydrate deficient transferring ( CDT ) assess . Trough blood level R &amp; S-baclofen assess individual week 4 . In summary , present proposal innovative clinical significance test compare standard high-dose baclofen efficacy safety individual AD . The proposal adequately power test primary hypothesis provide good power ass whether drinks/drinking day predictive baclofen response . Adequate power also present examine anxiolytic effect baclofen . Ascertaining effect standard high-dose baclofen , predictive value heavy drink baclofen response anxiolytic effect baclofen important goal towards determine whether baclofen true value clinical management patient alcohol dependence .</detailed_description>
