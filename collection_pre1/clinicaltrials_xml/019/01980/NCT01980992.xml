	<brief_title>Oral Immunotherapy Wheat Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Food allergy affect 6-8 percent child United States . Wheat one eight common food induce allergic reaction US . Current treatment food allergy complete avoidance food carry antihistamines self-injectable epinephrine accidental reaction occurs . However , accidental exposure allergen process food may difficult avoid . Currently , several therapeutic strategy investigate prevent treat food allergy . Since immunotherapy injection food allergy associate high rate allergic reaction , alternate approach treatment need . Oral ( mouth ) immunotherapy ( OIT ) one approach try study treatment food allergy . The intent study examine clinical effect safety wheat OIT . This study last 2 year . All eligible subject receive wheat oral food challenge ( OFC ) . Those react 1923mg less vital wheat gluten randomize Wheat OIT placebo . All eligible enrolled subject 1-year 2-year OFC . Placebo subject crossover Wheat OIT 1-year time point . At select visit , blood urine collection , physical examination , prick skin test , atopic dermatitis asthma evaluation occur .</detailed_description>
