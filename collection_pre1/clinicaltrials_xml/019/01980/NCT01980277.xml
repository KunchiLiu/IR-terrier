	<brief_summary>The overall rationale study evaluate tolerance efficacy LY2780301 combination paclitaxel HER2-negative , inoperable locally advanced metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) base : - medical need population either hormonal-resistant unsensitive and/or rapidly progressive disease - preclinical evidence involvement PI3K/AKT pathway tumor progression drug resistance , include taxanes well potential reversion AKT inhibition - high level frequency PI3K/AKT activation HER2-negative MBC - vitro vivo preclinical activity LY2780301 , synergistic combination various anticancer agent , include taxanes - favourable profile tolerance LY2780301 phase I trial Weekly paclitaxel conventionally administer 80 mg/m²/week standard treatment breast cancer ( BC ) As described , LY2780301 500 mg daily establish RP2D phase I single agent trial . Evidence pharmacodynamic activity note 400-500 mg QD . Conservatively , first dose level explore LY2780301 400 mg QD paclitaxel 70 mg/m²/week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase Ib/II Study LY2780301 Combination With Weekly PACLITAXEL HER2-metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE OF THE STUDY DESIGN The purpose study : 1. determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) LY2780301 combination weekly paclitaxel HER2-negative , inoperable locally advanced MBC patient 2. estimate objective response rate ( ORR ) combination first-line treated , HER2-negative , inoperable locally advanced MBC patient . In addition , study assess role PI3K/AKT/S6 pathway activation potential predictive factor response LY2780301 patient population . This trial phase Ib/II prospective , multicentre , open label , uncontrolled study . Phase Ib use continuous reassessment method ( CRM ) design , allow reach safely quickly MTD RP2D combination , ensure treatment least 18 patient secure tolerance profile . Phase II estimate antitumor activity overall patient population patient activation PI3K/AKT/S6 axis , allow examine potential value predictive biomarker</detailed_description>
