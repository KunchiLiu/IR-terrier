	<detailed_description>The propose research test acceptability efficacy early preventive intervention antecedent severe mental illness follow hypothesis : 1 . Do young people risk severe mental illness accept cognitive-behavioural intervention target early antecedent severe mental illness ? 2 . Does cognitive-behavioural intervention target antecedent severe mental illness reduce rate unusual auditory visual experience , loss previously acquire ability , anxiety , unstable mood ? 3 . Does cognitive-behavioural intervention focus antecedent reduce emotional distress young people risk severe mental illness ? 4 . Is social function improved young people risk severe mental illness antecedent-focused cognitive-behavioural intervention ? 5 . ( Long-term ) Does early cognitive-behavioural intervention target antecedent reduce risk develop severe mental illness ? Design : investigator propose test new preventive intervention antecedent condition individual would currently receive intervention . Therefore , best comparison propose intervention group individual differ intervention group baseline neither offer specific intervention discourage seek treatment may normally receive . Such non-intervention comparison group best achieve use recently-developed cohort-multiple randomize control design ( cmRCT ; Relton et al. , 2010 ) In cmRCT , eligible participant identify within cohort study , follow participant measure outcomes interest . A proportion eligible participant within cohort randomly select approach offer intervention interest , eligible participant cohort approach ( i.e. , control ) . All participant continue follow part cohort irrespective whether accept offer intervention . This enable realistic , fair complete evaluation intervention effect . Those randomly select offer maCBT approach , give full information plan intervention ask provide separate write consent intervention study . Intervention : Multimodal Antecedent-focussed Cognitive-behavioural Training ( maCBT ) . This integrated model focus normalisation unusual experience , re-appraisal , explore helpfulness current coping , develop repertoire strategy decrease impact experience young person 's life . The maCBT follow manual describe obligatory optional therapeutic element , propose list module , outline therapeutic session , integrate cognitive model . The model technique adapt age range 9 17 year , visual material child friendly language option young part age range ( 9-12 ) teen-relevant interpersonal content option older part age range ( 13-17 ) . The intervention deliver 8 16 one-hour session individual format . Sessions initially weekly , space every two week latter stage intervention .</detailed_description>
