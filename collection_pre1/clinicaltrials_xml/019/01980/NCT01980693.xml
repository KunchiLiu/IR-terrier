	<detailed_description>Skeletal maturity assessment , define also bone age ( BA ) , important role pediatrics pediatric endocrinology , use mainly evaluate growth puberty relate endocrine disorder . Repeated BA assessment important follow child short stature , precocious puberty treat growth promote medication . The commonly use method use determine skeletal maturity , thus BA base comparison hand wrist radiographs standard series representative film `` Radiographic atlas skeletal development hand wrist '' Greulich Pyle ( GP ) , issue several decade ago . Among disadvantage drawback BA assessment method : obligatory need use radiology unit often available special facility hospital , available physician office , exposure ionize radiation , know limitation method need endocrinologist ass BA , know large inter observer variability BA interpretation . The suggested method study base ultrasound technology , therefore quick , objective , radiation-free . It deliver immediate non bias result without need rely observer 's evaluation hand radiograph without need specialize radiology facility . This technique innovate order find efficient , convenient non radiation base method skeletal maturity assessment primary care physician perform office setting . The aim study establish new bone age database ultrasound apparatus ( SonicBone ) eventually replace X-ray base assessment use Greulich Pyle Tanner &amp; Whitehouse Atlas method . The design study perform concomitant skeletal maturation assessment read ultrasound technique use SonicBone apparatus . Skeletal maturation assessment perform female male various age group 4-17 year old .</detailed_description>
