	<brief_title>Antibiotic Prophylaxis Revision , Clean Head Neck Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical wound infection ( SWI ) common complication many operation , include head neck ( H &amp; N ) surgery , report rate range 3.5 87 % . While prophylactic antibiotic use show decrease SWI clean-contaminated contaminate surgery , use clean surgery debatable . In type clean surgery value prophylactic antibiotic minimal , however case might justify , include radical neck dissection , previously irradiate neck , tracheostomy immunosuppressed patient - although consensus regard risk factor . Previous research show adherence guideline regard prophylactic antibiotic use lacking , one study show great 40 % rate inappropriate antibiotic administration . This may partially attribute patient risk factor , cover exist guideline . One risk factor previous H &amp; N surgery . While study address issue H &amp; N surgery , study clean neurosurgical operation show almost trice-fold increase SWI rate operation ( 4 % vs. 13 % ) . The purpose study investigate effect prophylactic antibiotic use repeat clean H &amp; N surgery . This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study . The study conduct Otolaryngology department Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikva . Patients randomly assign 2 group , group compose 50 patient : study group receive 1 dose intravenous Cefazolin 1 gram/2 gram body mass index &gt; 40 control group receive 1 dose placebo . The drug/placebo give 30-60 minute prior incision . Previous study show benefit longer duration prophylactic antibiotic coverage . Both study drug placebo prepare designated nurse department . The nurse use randomization site ( www.random.org min set 1 max set 1000 ) give participant number . A predefined Excel table contain assignment number one group . Only nurse know assignment patient assess patient post-operatively . The patient , surgeon researcher blind patient ' assignment . The status surgical wound assess daily hospitalization plan follow-up visit 3-4 week discharge . During follow-up visit , patient question regard symptom sign SWI antibiotic prescription give post-operative period . SWI diagnosis accord Center Disease Control 's `` guideline surgical site infection '' . Treatment SWI accord regular department protocol ( regard study allocation ) .</detailed_description>

Tracheostomy status . Immunosuppression . Concurrent infection require antibiotic use . Any factor surgery surgeon estimate require prophylactic antibiotic use . Allergy cephalosporins allergy penicillin precludes use cephalosporin ( e.g . anaphylaxis ) .</criteria>
