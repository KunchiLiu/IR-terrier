	<brief_summary>Monitoring ovarian stimulation vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ( ICSI ) simplify reduce procedure measure follicle ultrasound . Proponents simplified procedure claim procedure reduce simple monitoring ultrasound maintain result ( number mature oocyte , percentage pregnancy live birth rate ) . On hand simultaneous blood sample measure hormone level still state art many clinic . A large review ( Cochrane review ) state `` although clear evidence well outcome , combine cycle monitoring still recommend could prove ovarian hyperstimulation avoid without hormonal monitoring '' . Investigators therefore perform study compare result 2 group : ultrasound monitoring combine monitoring . Deciding plan retrieval oocytes depend subtle difference number large follicle measure ultrasound , also hormonal level blood patient . Therefore investigator plan randomize study group patient combine monitoring . The investigator examine delay moment planning moment oocyte retrieval 24 hour effect number mature oocytes pregnancy rate effect rise progesterone level might . The investigator hypothesis combine monitoring could lead good result since recent study think rise progesterone level , find , negative impact pregnancy rate . On hand investigator expect find waiting large follicle case normal progesterone level lead good oocyte yield .</brief_summary>
