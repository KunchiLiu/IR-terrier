	<brief_title>Dabrafenib Lapatinib Ditosylate Treating Patients With Refractory Thyroid Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) use combination dabrafenib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe record anti-tumor activity . II . Evaluate potential mechanism primary resistance v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ( BRAF ) mutant thyroid cancer dabrafenib perform pathway profile tumor biopsy therapy . III . Obtain preliminary data activity combination lapatinib dabrafenib BRAF mutant thyroid cancer image . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lapatinib ditosylate . Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 lapatinib ditosylate PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : Patients also receive dabrafenib PO 2 week prior begin treatment lapatinib ditosylate . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
