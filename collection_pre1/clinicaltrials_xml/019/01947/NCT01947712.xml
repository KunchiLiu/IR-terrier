	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) clinical set characterize exceptionally high risk cardiovascular event . Oxidative stress seem play role impair flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) contribute atherosclerosis patient PAD . Cocoa seem exert artery dilatation via oxidative stress inhibition . OBJECTIVES : To investigate whether PAD patient , dark chocolate elicits artery dilatation via down-regulation NOX2 , catalytic core NADPH oxidase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis represent major cause worldwide death ; complex phenomenon encompasses intricate interplay classic cardiovascular risk factor , oxidative stress inflammation . Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) clinical set well represent model widespread atherosclerosis . PAD affect 20 % patient age 75 . Furthermore , PAD patient exceptionally high risk cardiovascular event majority eventually die cardiac cerebrovascular etiology . Polyphenol could represent novel therapeutic strategy counteract atherosclerosis . During last decade , grow interest polyphenols result prospective epidemiological study show beneficial effect substance human health . In particular , polyphenols exert beneficial effect inhibition NADPH oxidase ( NOX2 ) , enzyme directly involved atherosclerosis ; thus , activation enzyme lead enhance production oxidative stress inflammatory process . The objective study evaluate effect polyphenols oxidative stress inflammation surrogate marker atherosclerosis PAD patient . Polyphenols , inhibit NOX2-mediated oxidative stress immune-mediated process , could represent novel therapy reduce high risk cardiovascular event PAD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Every PAD patient enrol study : 1. claudication ( define leg pain walking , disappear within 10 minute stand , presume atherosclerotic origin ) 2. ankle/brachial index ( ABI ) , assess ankle/arm systolic blood pressure ratio Doppler ultrasonography &lt; 0.90 bad leg rest . Patients stable condition without abrupt change ABI ( &gt; 20 % ) last month enrolment . Subjects exclude study liver insufficiency , serious renal disorder ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.8 mg/dL ) , acute stroke , acute myocardial infarction , deep venous thrombosis current smoker take antioxidant .</criteria>
