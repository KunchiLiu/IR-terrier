	<brief_summary>Treatment locally advance metastatic squamous cell carcinoma lung involve use chemotherapy therapeutic mainstay . Platinum-etoposide regimen ( cisplatin-etoposide ) commonly use chemotherapeutic regimen , deliver intravenously standard three-weekly interval . Recent interest oral metronomic chemotherapy arisen , especially due beneficial effect delay disease progression among heavily pre-treated patient various malignancy . This study attempt combine use metronomic chemotherapy concurrently standard intravenous chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metronomic Cyclophosphamide Combination With Standard Chemotherapy Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenocarinoma squamous cell carinoma two major type non-small cell lung carcinoma . While patient adenocarcinoma lung feasibility treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor , patient squamous cell carcinoma treat standard chemotherapy due ineffectiveness tyrosine kinase inhibitor . Thus , current standard treat patient squamous cell lung cancer standard intravenous chemotherapy , mostly deliver three week . Metronomic chemotherapy , mean delivery low dos chemotherapy , often oral approach , daily basis maintain low definite level chemotherapy receive great interest recent time due beneficial effect term extend progression free survival among patient various malignancy , even failure previous conventional therapy . Metronomic chemotherapy propose active alternate mechanism , predominant anti-angiogenic effect , contrast cytotoxic genotoxic effect standard chemotherapy . Metronomic chemotherapy oral cyclophosphamide show extend progression free survival use single agent various malignancy . Given fact progression vary time span rule ( rather exception ) among patient squamous cell lung cancer treat conventional chemotherapy , intend combine use oral metronomic chemotherapy give concurrently standard intravenous cisplatin-etoposide base chemotherapy . We intend observe prolongation progression free survival .</detailed_description>
