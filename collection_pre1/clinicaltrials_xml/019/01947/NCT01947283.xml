	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn patient healthcare provider interact order improve share decision making . The investigator plan test intervention two separate educational components—one patient one providers—designed encourage patient ask question increase level involvement care , simultaneously train provider receptive patient ' question concern . Patients intervention group receive three short ( 30-45 minute ) training focus develop ask question interview three time course intervention see affect quality care . Providers receive intervention participate three separate training , include 12-hour group workshop , additional two hour training , six hour individual instruction , include personalize feedback base three audio-recorded patient visit . Previous study look patient engagement involvement decision-making show increased engagement link improved outcome , provider sometimes prepared develop collaborative relationship patient . The investigator think train patient provider work together communicate effectively improve quality care increase patient satisfaction intervention focus one side clinical encounter . One major goal study patient-provider communication improve share decision-making see contribute racial ethnic disparity mental health care , since minority patient show less involved care show perceive treat differently provider .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness DECIDE Patient-Provider Communication , Therapeutic Alliance &amp; Care Continuation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Center Multicultural Mental Health Research ( CMMHR ) Cambridge Health Alliance recently select funding Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) address importance patient-provider communication , share decision making , therapeutic alliance . Our research team demonstrate psycho-educational intervention ( DECIDE-PA ) improve patient activation self-management behavioral health care . However , investigator find provider unresponsive react negatively patient ' activation . In response , investigator propose combine DECIDE-PA provider coaching ( DECIDE-PC ) increase provider ' receptivity patient activation , improve Shared Decision Making ( SDM ) . The investigator also focus quality care , respond clinic administrator require intervention improve quality behavioral health care ( mental health substance treatment ) . Aims : 1 ) Test effectiveness DECIDE PA+PC compare usual care improve SDM patient-perceived quality behavioral health care ; 2 ) Test whether patient-centered communication therapeutic alliance mediate effect DECIDE PA+PC intervention SDM ; 3 ) Explore whether ethnic/racial language match patient provider moderate effect DECIDE PA+PC SDM quality behavioral health care . Intervention : The DECIDE PA+PC intervention design improve quality mental health care adult behavioral health patient engage minority participant ask question treatment . The intervention administer patient provider design improve patient activation , self-management , therapeutic alliance . For patient , DECIDE PA design help patient identify concern condition treatment generate question provider regard concern . The DECIDE PA intervention consist 3-4 brief training session patient deliver Care Managers . For provider , DECIDE PC design help provider improve therapeutic alliance , patient-provider communication , continuance care , satisfaction service patient concordant discordant ethnic/racial dyad . The DECIDE PC train provider consist 1.5 day train focus augment patient-centered communication therapeutic alliance possible underlying pathway SDM take place . The training also address 1 ) lack perspective taking ; 2 ) frequent attributional error provider make ; 3 ) decrease receptivity patient participation collaboration decision making . The training include provider coach total 15-20 hour . Methods : For Aim 1 , implement randomize control trial compare DECIDE-PA+PC usual care Shard Decision Making ( SDM ) perceive quality care . Identify treatment effect use multi-level model account nesting observation , patient , provider , clinic . For Aim 2 , identify underlying mechanism effect DECIDE-PA+PC intervention SDM . Mediation analysis technique use allow rigorous test causal pathway statistical adjustment spurious correlation use instance mediator SDM measurement contemporaneous . For Aim 3 , expand Aim 1 model test whether DECIDE-PA+PC impact SDM perceive quality differentially ethnic/racial concordant/discordant dyad . Usual Care : Usual care across clinic describe clinician answer patient ' question clinical encounter . Clinicians report average perceive patient limited involvement decision-making . No DECIDE training patient provider apply control condition control provider control patient participate study . Once control provider control patient complete participation study , offer DECIDE training . Participating Sites : The investigator plan administer intervention patient provider four participate Cambridge Health Alliance clinic , along Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Boston Children 's Hospital , South Cove Community Health Center , Edward M Kennedy Health Center ( Great Brook Valley Health Center ) , two community health center Harbor Health Services ( Neponset Health Center Geiger Gibson Community Health Center ) .</detailed_description>
