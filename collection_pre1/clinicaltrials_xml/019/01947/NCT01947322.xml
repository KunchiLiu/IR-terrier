	<detailed_description>NK cell-mediated cytotoxity regulate signal provide surface inhibitory activate receptor . Target cell kill absence interaction NK inhibitory receptor ligands ( HLA class I molecules ) target cell . The proposed phase I/II study plan realize adoptive anti-leukaemic immunotherapy infusion haploidentical HLA-I mismatch NK cell treat poor prognosis AML patient . Familial donor NK cell select accord HLA type order choose donor NK cell express least one inhibitory receptor recognize HLA class I molecule recipient cell . NK cell select donor peripheral mononuclear cell two step purification protocol ( CD3 negative subsequent CD56 positive selection ) . NK cell activate ex vivo overnight presence IL-2 infusion . In vivo IL-2 injection perform 14 day . Before NK-infusion , patient condition cytoreductive immunosuppressive chemotherapy . An extensive biological study NK cell perform recipient post-infusion , include chimerism analysis , phenotypic functional test order evaluate NK-cell expansion post-infusion capacity mediate antitumoral effect . Since donor NK cell select potential graft versus host ( GvH ) graft versus leukemia ( GvL ) reactivity , approach might induce prolonged cytopenia due direct toxicity NK cell normal hematopoietic progenitor . The main goal study thus evaluate ( 1 ) hematological feasibility allogeneic NK-cell infusion , ( 2 ) expansion infuse population , ( 3 ) antitumoral effect mediate adoptive immunotherapy . This essential step development anti-tumoral immunotherapeutic approach , leukemic patient also solid tumor could sensitive `` NK-effect '' ( melanoma , kidney cancer ) . This project include 4 clinical department several laboratory cellular therapy immunology get expertise field Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) , cellular therapy NK-cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Recipient selection 1 . Patient eligibility Poor prognosis de novo AML include : 1 . Primary refractory disease ( absence complete remission ( CR ) least 2 different induction regimen ) 2 . Relapsed disease reach CR least 1 salvage therapy 3 . First untreated early relapse ( less one year remission duration ) absence allogeneic HSCT project . Age 18 65 No liver renal dysfunction contraindicate administration Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide Cytarabine . Written inform consent 2 . Patient exclusion criterion Secondary AML . Previous autologous allogeneic transplantation . Since main objective study concern hematological toxicity , decide exclude patient secondary AML previously transplant expect higher hematological toxicity . Patient allogeneic transplant project HIV positive serology 2 . Donor eligibility HLA haploidentical brother , sister , child ( old 18 year ) , father , sister , cousin , uncle , aunt . Donor KIR ligand mismatch GvL direction Absence contraindication leukapheresis . Negative HIV12 , HTLV12 , HBV , HCV serology . Negative viral genomic screening HTLV12 HCV Written inform consent</criteria>
