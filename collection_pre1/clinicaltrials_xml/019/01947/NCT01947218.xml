	<brief_summary>Asthma COPD characterize accelerated decline lung function associate incompletely reversible airflow obstruction . This could result lung structural change inflammation . Tissue repair mechanism may result restitution ad integrum bronchial epithelium . But case , especially COPD severe asthma , `` remodel '' characterize mucus cell hyperplasia , overproduction mucus , physicochemical , biological immunological change . Clinically , mucus overproduction report patient clinical symptom call `` chronic bronchitis '' . Generally , develop bronchiolar level responsible progression disease . There paradox , intrinsic property mucus seem rather beneficial fighting may really wise long-term . Especially defensive effect microbial agent remain poorly explain . Currently , treatment aim reduce production mucus mechanism lead overproduction poorly understand severe asthma COPD . The identification new target treat overproduction mucus COPD therefore major interest . In view current knowledge , inflammatory mediator signal transduction lead increased mucin production increase number goblet cell probably IL-9 , IL-13 , IL -1ß TNF-α involve calcium-sensitive chloride channel . Intracellular signal pathway seem base STAT-6 , FOXA2 , SPDEF , EGFR / COX-2</brief_summary>
