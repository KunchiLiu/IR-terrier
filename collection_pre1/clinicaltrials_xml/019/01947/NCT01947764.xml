We evaluate experience medication-taking ART adherence child Kenya East Africa , currently carry validation study develop pediatric ART adherence measurement strategy include disclosure assessment . ( 1K23MH087225-01 ) We conduct systematic review disclosure child resource-limited setting , implement clinical training program pediatric disclosure Kenya , do pilot work evaluate prevalence impact disclosure within AMPATH HIV care system western Kenya . Our result consistently demonstrate importance disclosure pediatric adherence sustain daily care child HIV , yet disclosure rate remain low standard care , particularly parent guardian fear disclosure . We propose cluster randomize trial ass effectiveness patient-centered disclosure intervention HIV-infected Kenyan child family . In HADITHI ( Helping AMPATH Disclose Information Talk HIV Infection ) trial , objective evaluate efficacy intensive , culturally adapt , narrative-based disclosure intervention HIV-infected Kenyan child compare less intensive disclosure process currently use standard care . Our primary endpoint disclosure status two-years follow-up , secondary endpoint related clinical , psychological , social outcome . The central hypothesis intensive disclosure intervention base culture-specific qualitative work patient-centered approach allow high rate disclosure allow child know HIV status , also improve medication adherence , improve medical outcome , unimpaired psychological and/or behavioral outcome , increase experience stigma social isolation time .
