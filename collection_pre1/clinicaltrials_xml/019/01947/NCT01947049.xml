	<detailed_description>Four strategically select medical center across US ( represent West Coast , Southwest , Midwest ; East Coast ) enroll adult subject present ED acute respiratory illness fulfill CDC recommend criterion receive antiviral therapy . At 4 site , dedicate research coordinator approach adult ( age &gt; 18 year old ) ED patient broadly define respiratory related complaint screen meet CDC recommend criterion antiviral therapy ( i.e . 'high-risk complication ' 'potential influenza-related complication ) . Consenting subject nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swab collect Xpert Flu test gold standard reverse transcription-PCR ( rt-PCR ) test research protocol . The investigator compare test result rapid flu test gold standard rt-PCR test order assess clinical performance characteristic new rapid test ( Objective 1 ) . The investigator also collect demographic medical historical information use brief structure data form , use combination rt-PCR test result derive validate clinical decision guideline ( Objective 2 ) . The investigator simultaneously randomize 2 4 hospital Rapid Testing Group ( systematic rapid flu test perform result provide clinician ) , Control Group ( follow standard care practice test leave discretion individual clinician ) . This permit comparison rate ED antiviral administration prescription two group assess clinical impact influenza test ( Objective 3 ) . Finally , cost data ED visit subsequent hospitalization collect subject rapid test group control group inform cost-utility analysis rapid influenza test compare current standard care ( Objective 4 ) .</detailed_description>
