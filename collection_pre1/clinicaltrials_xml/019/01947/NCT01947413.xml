	<brief_summary>The fundamental goal early rehabilitation patient stroke : optimize motor function within patient 's prognostic potential , prevent development secondary condition impact life-long health , promote patient 's participation live . In addition employ clinical measure treatment , usual outcome measure employ intervention study include movement kinematics ( spatio-temporal characteristic movement ) . Recent report suggest repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) BoNTA ( BoNTA ) improve motor function patient stroke . A novel rTMS paradigm , theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) , include intermittent TBS ( iTBS ) continuous TBS ( cTBS ) , modulate human cortical excitability differently . However , lack literature verify treatment effect integration clinical kinematic analysis . Until , conclusive result regard optimal rTMS protocol , stimulate pattern patient stroke . Additionally , study investigate possible clinical characteristic patient stroke may influence effect various treatment protocol propose project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Protocols Treatment Upper Limb Dysfunctions Patients With Stroke .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research program aim study patient stroke immediate maintaining effect new upper-extremity ( UE ) treatment protocol brain damage identify possible mechanism underlie treatment-induced change patient stroke . This research study new treatment approach formulate base principle integrated central modulation ( rTMS ) peripheral modification technique ( BoNTA ) . 1 . To compare movement function motor control patient stroke different motor severity . 2 . To investigate immediate maintaining effect different protocol treatment upper limb function . 3 . To evaluate motor control clinical outcome different treatment approach apply UE training patient stroke . The treatment approach study include different protocol . We hypothesize improvement movement performance treatment level post-treatment performance differ among treatment different reorganization pattern . 3.1 To compare motor control clinical outcome different treatment approach . 3.2 To identify optimal treatment protocol patient stroke . 4 . To investigate possible predictor treatment outcome associate motor severity , movement participation type treatment . The possible predictor include brain lesion , severity . We hypothesize propose prognostic factor predict treatment outcome . 5 . To analyze association motor reorganization measure kinematic study behavioral improvement motor severity , movement participation measure clinical tool . Treating motor dysfunction patient stroke require understand mechanism underlying motor control . Recent report suggest BoNTA rTMS improve motor function patient various disorder . However , research identify optimal rTMS protocol treatment upper limb dysfunction patient stroke . There lack literature verify treatment effect movement control study . The current research offer valuable kinematic data support neural-motor model propose account motor control problem patient . More important , identify new protocol treatment upper limb dysfunction patient stroke integration clinical kinematic measure . We identify clinical predictor influence outcome different treatment approach , analyze association motor control clinical measure involve motor severity , movement participation . We believe result study refine service support patient stroke meet goal . This study may potentially provide direction kinematic measure future study patient stroke .</detailed_description>
