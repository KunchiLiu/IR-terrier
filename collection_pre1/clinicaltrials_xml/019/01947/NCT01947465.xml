	<brief_summary>Backgound relevance project : Patients autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease ( AIIRD ) increase risk contracting infection . The increase risk attribute immunological disorder , well immunosuppressive treatment . Vaccination many infection recommend patient group . However , immunogenicity vaccine may reduce may also influence administered treatment . Potential reactivation underlie disease trigger vaccination another important concern . From patient ' public health perspective , important task physician give advice vaccine . Completing task often difficult , data immunogenicity safety vaccine patient group scarce , especially regard treatment new immunosuppressive medication , biological agent . Lastly importantly , due new therapeutic option , health among AIIRD patient considerably improve increase number patient undertake overseas travel activity require additional vaccination . In context , reliable advice regard vaccination almost impossible , travel vaccination immunogenicity safety profile unknown . Research address immunogenicity safety vaccine different autoimmune inflammatory disease treat different immunosuppressive medication urgently need allow give evidence base vaccine advice . In observational study immunogenicity safety tetanus booster hepatitis A vaccination assessed AIIRD patient . The immune response evaluate function underlie disease possible influence commonly use immunosuppressive drug immune response study . Rationale study tetanus booster hepatitis A vaccine Tetanus vaccination one frequently recommended vaccination , effect booster vaccination address . Hepatitis A vaccine widely use travel vaccine . Despite importance , limited data available tetanus hepatitis A vaccine patient group . By focus vaccine study lead way evaluation vaccine . The purpose study determine whether tetanus hepatitis A vaccination immunogenic safe AIIRD patient healthy control .</brief_summary>
