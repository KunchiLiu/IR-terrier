The purpose study ( 1 ) examine microbiome stool colon ( 2 ) determine whether healthy-donated stool enema treat pediatric ulcerative colitis . ( 3 ) The investigator also study effect treatment colonic gene expression .</brief_summary>

Pre-colonoscopy FMT therapy preparation : One two day prior schedule colonoscopy study participant ask provide stool sample . They also undergo bowel clean-out Miralax colonoscopy preparation . Colonoscopy ( endoscopic examination large bowel ) use deliver first donor fecal transplant begin therapeutic protocol . 2 . FMT treatment Initial colonoscopy : Fecal microbiota transplantation make possible utilizing donor ( healthy adult ) provide stool sample . The donor 's stool screen tested know disease-causing agent include virus , bacteria parasite prevent spread disease participant . On first day treatment , participant undergo colonoscopy deliver filter donor stool directly colon . Additionally , biopsy take procedure routine diagnostic well research purpose . III . Subsequent FMT treatment : Enemas give periodically complete total 1-year therapy . IV . Follow-up endoscopy sample : A similar limited procedure ( sigmoidoscopy ) repeat 14 week study period .
