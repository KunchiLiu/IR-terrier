	<brief_summary>The measure pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) useful index intensive care estimate right ventricular load . The reference technique measure right catheterism invasive technique . It possible estimate pulmonary artery pressure use transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) allow , use continuous Doppler , measure maximum speed tricuspid regurgitation ( TRvmax ) . The measure TRvmax however difficult intensive care patient little echogenicity impossible tricuspid leak . The evaluation tricuspid regurgitation also particularly difficult use TOE . To avoid drawback , one use analysis pulmonary ejection pulmonary artery ( PAAT ) TOE . However , data literature controversial method validate mechanically ventilate intensive care patient . The aim work compare three method measure PAP : measure TRVMAX ( mean tricuspid leak ) transthoracic echocardiography , measure TAAP transesophageal ultrasound direct measure pulmonary pressure right catheterization , ventilate patient already monitor catheter right cavity usual indication intensive care ( ARDS , shock ) . We shall analyze correlation TRVmax , TAAP pressure measure right catheterism serve reference technique .</brief_summary>
