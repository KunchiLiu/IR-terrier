	<brief_summary>Neonatal nutrition face contradictory conflict nutritional regimen like high percentage amino acid first day life order achieve normal neurodevelopment versus metabolic complication ( insulin resistance , hyperglycemia , increase visceral fat ) type feeding , conjunction complexity prematurity , likely cause . Current study aim investigate whether individualized fortification breast milk protein , base mother 's milk protein content target recommend daily protein requirement , associate good nutrition , growth , biochemical endocrine marker associate nutrition preterm low birth weight neonate , compare standard fortification human milk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Proteins important macromolecule live organism participate almost biological process . Premature infant force adapt new ( extrauterine ) environment supply nutrient , include amino acid , mother cease abruptly . Consequently , aim neonatologist appropriate , quantitatively qualitatively nutritional support , promote brain development , achieve normal endocrine metabolic function , maintain growth rate similar intrauterine one avoid extrauterine growth restriction postnatal period time encourage analogue modulation body composition ( increased muscle mass , decrease body fat , hydration ) . Malnutrition inadequate nutrition preterm infant remain undiagnosed without proper treatment could serious consequence psychomotor development metabolic activity . Indeed , 75 % low birth weight premature infant exhibit extrauterine growth restriction discharge , even achieve growth equal consider satisfactory , ie 15g/kg/day . Beyond anthropometrics difference preterm full-term newborn , body composition varies well . Preterms high percentage body fat decrease muscle mass term time compare full term neonate . However , clarify whether differentiation harmful predispose chronic disease later childhood adult life ( eg . obesity , metabolic syndrome ) .</detailed_description>
