	<brief_summary>Cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) brief , efficient , effective psychotherapy individual depressive anxiety disorder . However , CBT largely underutilized within Veteran Affairs Medical Centers ( VAMCs ) due cost burden training necessary deliver large number CBT protocol . Transdiagnostic CBT , contrast , specifically design address numerous distinct disorder within single protocol . This transdiagnostic approach potential dramatically improve accessibility CBT within VAMCs therefore improve clinical outcome Veterans . The propose research seek evaluate efficacy transdiagnostic CBT assess clinical outcome quality life VAMC patient depressive anxiety disorder throughout course treatment comparison exist evidence-based psychotherapy , behavioral activation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective To evaluate transdiagnostic CBT randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) VAMC patient depressive/anxiety disorder investigate preliminary efficacy reduce symptomatology , comorbidity , improve quality life compare behavioral activation therapy ( BAT ) ( psychotherapy control condition ) . Patient satisfaction predictor feasibility ( attendance dropout ) also assess . Recruitment Strategy VAMC patient recruit Primary Care - Mental Health Integration program CBT Clinic Ralph H. Johnson ( RHJ ) VAMC . Within program , VAMC patient report symptom depression anxiety meet mental health staff member complete diagnostic interview self-report measure part standard clinical practice . If VAMC patient endorse symptoms consistent depressive/anxiety disorder , patient 's interest participate research assess , agreeable research , patient put contact research staff ( day meet and/or follow-up phone schedule research assessment ) . A research assessment complete project staff first complete consent documentation ass inclusion/exclusion criterion ( target sample 96 VAMC patient ; &gt; 72 completers ) , include semi-structured clinical interview self-report questionnaire focus psychiatric symptom quality life . Participants meet diagnostic criterion target disorder randomize study condition , assign project therapist . Because VAMC patient meet study criterion likely present multiple depressive/anxiety disorder , principal diagnosis , impair diagnosable disorder , use select patient participation . To balance diagnosis across two condition , stratify random assignment base principal diagnosis use common principal diagnosis ( MDD , PTSD , PD ) . Procedures Eligible VAMC patient randomize one two treatment condition : transdiagnostic CBT BAT . Both treatment condition include 12-16 weekly 50-minute individual psychotherapy session . The total number session vary slightly depend participant need progress therapy , common CBT approach psychotherapy ( serve covariate outcome analysis ) . The general format session involve : 1 ) brief check-in ; 2 ) review material previous session ; 3 ) review homework assignment ; 4 ) overview new material in-session exercise ; 5 ) assignment homework next session . Attendance homework completion record . Randomization Procedures Participants randomly assign ( 1:1 ) one two study arm ( n = 48 per arm ) use permute block randomization procedure . Randomization stratify principal diagnostic group block size vary minimize likelihood unmasking . After determine eligibility complete consent baseline assessment material , enrol participant assign treatment group Project Research Assistant use computer generate randomization scheme . Once participant randomize attends first session , include intent-to-treat analysis . Randomization occur participant level . Transdiagnostic CBT Treatment Condition As noted Preliminary Studies section , transdiagnostic CBT protocol develop revise two demonstration study one focus group . The result protocol involve several primary component , include psychoeducation symptom depression anxiety ( session 1 ) , assessment motivation setup treatment plan ( session 2 ) , exposure therapy ( session 3-15 ) , relapse prevention ( final session ) . In addition primary component , optional module include supplement exposure therapy later treatment address secondary symptom ( e.g. , anger , sleep , hypervigilance , drink cope ) . The goal module allow provider tailor treatment specific symptom may present single set diagnosis may reduce effect primary exposure approach . Session weekly 45-60 minute homework assignment complete session . BAT Control Condition To provide evidence-based comparison transdiagnostic CBT condition , second group participant receive manualized BAT . BAT base early behavioral model suggest decrease positively reinforce healthy behavior associate development negative affect . In general , BAT involve teach patient monitor mood daily activity goal increase pleasant , reinforce activity reduce unpleasant event . BA brief treatment , administer either individual group format , demonstrate reliable effectiveness across wide range university , community , civilian Veteran clinical sample depression . BAT also show effective treatment PTSD relate depressive/anxiety disorder Veterans . In present study , BAT condition manualized , follow exist protocol literature . BAT structurally equivalent transdiagnostic CBT session length ( 45-60 minute ) , frequency session ( weekly ) , duration treatment ( 12-16 session ) , amount homework .</detailed_description>

VAMC patient exclude due factor reconsider participation condition relate exclusion resolve stabilize . Together , inclusion/exclusion criterion allow vast majority interested VAMC patient depressive/anxiety disorder eligible participate . Ineligible VAMC patient refer nonstudyrelated treatment within mental health RHJ VAMC .</criteria>
