	<detailed_description>Patients autoimmune disease like inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) increase risk infection . This increased susceptibility infection due disease , also be-cause many patient autoimmune condition treat immuno-suppressive drug . Different drug well-known suppressor immune system : Prednisolone , Azathioprine , Methotrexate ( MTX ) , TNF-a inhibitor , new biological agent , e.g. , Rituximab ( RTX ) , drug use treatment RA patient often combination MTX . The extent immunosuppression induce therapeutic agent seem depend , extent , pharmacological dose/response relationship combination drug , individual variability play major role well . Prophylactic measure vaccination , quick upstart antibiotic case fever general information patient handle fever etc . important order prevent many case serious infection possible among patient immunosuppressive treatment . Streptococcus pneumoniae cause worldwide morbidity mortality . Pneumococcal vaccine available since early 1980 's . The vaccine license immunization child &gt; 2 year adults polysaccharide-based vaccine ( 23PPV ) consist capsule part 23 frequent serotypes pneumococcus . This vaccine elicit normal immunocompetent person high antibody response , last approximately 10 year . Because 23PPV polysaccharide-based vaccine , induce T-cell independent response memory there-fore possibility boosting . In 2001 , first generation conjugate pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV7 ) license . In PCV 's , capsule material pneumococcus conjugate protein , mean vaccine elicit T-cell dependent immune response even infants give memory response booster possibility . This vaccine license use child 0-5 year , study suggest PCV immunization might useful group people well etc . immunodeficient child adult ( especially second-generation vaccine PCV10 , PCV13 license cover pneumococcal serotypes ) . Some study show patient treat immunosuppressive drug mount sufficient antibody response upon vaccination whereas study suggest patient group respond conventional vaccination . It recommend Danish guideline pneumococcal vaccination , elderly patient chronic disease patient decrease immune system vaccinate pneumococcal disease . Accordingly , patient Crohn 's disease treat TNF-a inhibitor recommend pneumococcal vaccination . In study , investigator aim carry investigation response pneumococcal vaccination person Crohn 's disease treat TNF-a inhibitor and/or azathioprine , order determine place usage conjugate vaccination patient group .</detailed_description>
