	<detailed_description>Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive erlotinib 1 time day . Erlotinib take cup ( 8 ounce ) water time day . Erlotinib take within 2 hour take short-acting antacid , Tums Maalox . If side effect cause erlotinib , dose may lower may take study . If miss dose least 12 hour next dose , take miss dose . lf vomit , take another tablet next schedule dose . If necessary , erlotinib may dissolve water give feed tube . You give pill diary record take erlotinib . You bring pill diary visit review study staff . You also return unused tablet erlotinib visit . Study Visits : On day begin take erlotinib every 4 week : - You ask side effect may drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask smoke status . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test , include test check blood clotting function . Every 8 week : - You CT MRI scan chest X-ray check status disease . - If skin lesion , measure photograph . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You ask side effect may drug may take . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . Long-Term Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , contact telephone , write , e-mail , clinic visit every 3 month check status disease ask treatment may receive side effect may . If find , family member may contact information . This information may also collect check medical record . This investigational study . Erlotinib FDA approve commercially available treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Its use study investigational . Up 33 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
