	<brief_summary>Background : - A small brain protein call nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide ( NOP ) receptor may involve several brain disease anxiety , depression , drug abuse , seizure . Researchers interested test new radioactive chemical help locate NOP receptor brain image study positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Because chemical yet approve Food Drug Administration , consider experimental drug . Objectives : - To investigate effectiveness experimental chemical [ 11C ] NOP-1A imaging study nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide ( NOP ) receptor . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age able imaging study . Design : - This study involve three four outpatient visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . All participant screen full physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , electrocardiogram . - Participants involve one part three-part study direct study researcher . Part 1 consists brain imaging study brain respond chemical . Part 2 whole body image study evaluate chemical distribute throughout body administer . Part 3 set test retesting scan determine precise drug locate NOP receptor brain . - Part 1 : Participants brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Then study drug administer participant brain PET scan . Blood sample take PET scan , urine sample take scan . These test take 3 hour perform . - Part 2 : Participants whole body PET scan last maximum 3 hour . - Part 3 : Participants receive study drug two additional PET scan . Blood sample also take part .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide ( NOP ) receptor new class opioid receptor clone 1994 identify endogenous ligand . Within year , endogenous ligand identify soon many ligand develop evaluated vitro vivo NOP receptor distribution activity . NOP receptor widely distribute brain , spinal cord peripheral organ heart , lung , kidney , intestine liver . Being G-protein couple receptor , activation lead change intracellular signal transduction mediate adenylyl cyclase , Ca ( 2+ ) K ( + ) ion channel , mitogen-activated kinase phospholipase C. Based preclinical study , NOP receptor implicate regulation pain , anxiety depression , drug abuse , feeding , learning/memory , motor activity . Since time clone receptor identification endogenous ligand , numerous compound design target receptor . However , PET radioligands currently available study NOP distribution activity human . We wish test newly develop PET radioligand , [ ( 11 ) C ] NOP-1A study role NOP receptor human . The purpose protocol ( 1 ) perform brain image use [ ( 11 ) C ] NOP-1A healthy volunteer characterize brain uptake distribution ( 2 ) perform whole body PET study healthy volunteer order estimate radiation absorb dos [ ( 11 ) C ] NOP-1A , ( 3 ) perform brain test-retest study healthy volunteer order examine precision measurement receptor bind determine optimal parameter future experiment use [ ( 11 ) C ] NOP-1A , , ( 4 ) compare [ ( 11 ) C ] NOP-1A concentration artery vein healthy volunteer assess feasibility replace arterial line less invasive venous line brain scan . Successful development PET radioligand image NOP receptor strong impact understand clinical management neuropsychiatric disorder mediate opioid receptor system . Future experiment include study relevant neuropsychiatric disorder .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers : Subjects must adults 1850 year old . Subjects must able willing give write informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Current psychiatric illness severe systemic disease base history physical exam . If woman , pregnancy breast feeding ( betaHCG measure female patient within 24 hour scan must negative ) Clinically significant laboratory abnormality . Serious medical problem include limited chronic neurological disease multiple sclerosis , autoimmune disease cardiopulmonary disease . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer 10 minute . Recent exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) combine study would allowable limit . Positive urine drug screen screen . Inability lie flat camera bed 2.5 hour Subjects metallic foreign body would affect MRI magnet , fear enclose space likely make subject unable undergo MRI scan .</criteria>
