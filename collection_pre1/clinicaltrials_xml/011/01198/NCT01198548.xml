	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give high-dose cholecalciferol work treat patient receive combination chemotherapy bevacizumab first-line therapy metastatic colorectal cancer . Cholecalciferol treatment may delay development colorectal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving cholecalciferol together combination chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may effective treatment colorectal cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relative rate metastatic colorectal cancer patient achieve 25-D3 level &gt; = 40 ng/ml 8 week , 16 week , 24 week , 32 week start FOLFOX ( leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ) + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation ( cholecalciferol ) . II . To estimate median progression-free survival ( PFS ) metastatic colorectal cancer patient receive first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate response rate ( RR ) median overall survival ( OS ) metastatic colorectal cancer patient receive first-line FOLFOX + bevacizumab + high dose vitamin D3 supplementation . II . To describe safety combination capture treatment-related toxicity per National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria ( NCI-CTC ) version 4 guideline . OUTLINE : Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol orally ( PO ) daily . Patients also receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , oxaliplatin* IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour week . Courses repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Treatment oxaliplatin discontinue course 8 . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 30 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
