	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate change functional status result Exercise-Nutrition Program ( ENP ) target toward old adult reside senior housing facility . - The primary hypothesis 6-month intervention period subject intervention group realize significant improvement low extremity function compare control group . Secondary objective To evaluate change nutritional status result ENP . - The secondary hypothesis subject intervention group realize significant increase circulate insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) demonstrate improvement nutritional status compare control group . To evaluate change inflammatory status result ENP . - Subjects ENP group exhibit reduce concentration circulate interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) compare control group . To evaluate change psychosocial factor result ENP - The related hypothesis 6-month intervention period subject intervention group increase exercise self-efficacy , intrinsic motivation exercise , satisfaction psychological need compare control group . - Additionally hypothesize subject intervention group realize improvement mood quality life compare control group . To assess feasibility conduct Exercise-Nutrition Program senior housing facility setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Vitality , Independence , Vigor Elders Study I Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult fast grow segment population many country around world , maintenance independence emerge major public health priority . Although significant decline physical function consider inevitable consequence age , many study demonstrate targeted exercise program dramatically improve physical function , even advanced age . There also evidence appropriately time protein intake important exercise recovery growth maintenance lean body mass . Other nutrient may important muscle strength function well . Yet many old adult poor nutritional status . A combined exercise nutrition program functionally at-risk older adult , conveniently offer senior housing facility many reside , great potential improve functional status quality life population . Main objective - The primary objective study evaluate change functional status result Exercise-Nutrition Program ( ENP ) . - The primary hypothesis 6-month intervention period subject intervention group realize significant improvement low extremity function compare control group . Secondary objectives The secondary objective research project : - To evaluate change nutritional status result ENP . - The secondary hypothesis subject intervention group realize significant increase circulate IGF-1 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) demonstrate improvement nutritional status compare control group . - Subjects ENP exhibit reduction circulate plasma IL-6 concentration , indicative systemic inflammatory status . - To evaluate change psychosocial factor result ENP . - The related hypothesis 6-month intervention period subject intervention group increase exercise self-efficacy , intrinsic motivation exercise , satisfaction psychological need compare control group . - Additionally hypothesize subject intervention group realize improvement mood quality life compare control group . Another major objective ass feasibility conduct Exercise-Nutrition Program senior housing center facility set . TRIAL DESIGN Type trial The study objectives achieve context control , randomized field trial . Randomization site ( senior housing center ) . Intervention group subject participate Exercise-Nutrition Program ( ENP ) . Control group subject participate Successful Aging Program ( SAP ) , provide useful skill adequate attention control , affect primary outcome study . Subjects , group center : In study group number subject complete study protocol 40 ( see also 9.3 statistical section ) . Assuming conservative dropout rate 10 % 3 month intervention 15 % end 6 month study , sample 53 subject per group , 106 total , require enrol study . 16-20- senior housing center recruit run one class average size least 5 subject ( maximum 25 subject ) . Sites assign one 2 group : Group 1 : Exercise-Nutrition Program ( ENP ) Group 2 : Successful Aging Program ( SAP ) Duration subject participation : Subjects undergo propose intervention 6 month . The target population study elderly people ( 65 yrs+ ) living senior housing center .</detailed_description>
