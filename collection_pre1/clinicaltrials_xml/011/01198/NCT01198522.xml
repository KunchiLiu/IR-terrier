	<brief_summary>Systemic treatment advance , non-resectable pancreatic cancer still minimal impact survival patient . Even application potent gemcitabine-based regimen , survival 1 year uncommon advance disease . Accordingly , substantial unmet need improvement treatment option . The combination simultaneous application tumor-targeted L19IL2 gemcitabine could result improved anti-cancer efficacy , base preliminary clinical strong preclinical data . The primary purpose Phase I study define safe potentially active treatment regimen L19IL2 ( escalate dos ) combine gemcitabine advanced pancreatic cancer patient . Also , early sign anticancer response L19IL2/gemcitabine regimen assess compare historical control ( gemcitabine monotherapy ) .</brief_summary>
