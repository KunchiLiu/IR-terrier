	<brief_summary>Long-term immunosuppression carry potential adverse effect risk infection , malignancy , renal insufficiency , diabetes hypertension . In clinical liver transplantation , liver transplant recipient maintain allograft function without immunosuppressive drug . This call `` operational tolerance '' . Many attempt make identify immunological biomarkers predict operational tolerant patient . Therefore , investigator aim identify patient potential operationally tolerant use biomarkers , withdraw immunosuppressant gradually stop ultimately monitoring biomarkers .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Withdrawal Immunosuppression Long Term Stable Liver Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among long term stable liver transplant recipient , select proportion patient high potential obtain operational tolerance use biomarkers . Then , gradually reduce immunosuppressant monitor biomarkers well biochemical test . The course taper immunosuppressant take 1 year . During withdrawal immunosuppression , participant closely monitor liver enzyme , immunological profile . If sign rejection , liver biopsy undertaken participant treat use immunosuppressant . After complete withdrawal immunosuppressant , participant follow least 1 year .</detailed_description>
