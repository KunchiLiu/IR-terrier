	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study give everolimus together bevacizumab see well work compare everolimus alone treat patient advanced kidney cancer progress first-line therapy . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , interfere tumor growth block ability tumor cell grow spread . Everolimus bevacizumab may also stop growth kidney cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether give everolimus together bevacizumab well everolimus alone treat patient advanced kidney cancer progress first-line therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Kidney Cancer That Progressed After First-Line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To compare overall survival patient receive bevacizumab plus everolimus everolimus alone among patient advance renal cell carcinoma progress first line vascular epidermal growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) -tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival proportion experience objective response ( defined complete clinical response [ cCR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) patient advance renal cell carcinoma receive bevacizumab plus everolimus everolimus alone . II . To compare grade 3 high toxicity patient receive treatment regimen . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive everolimus PO QD day 1-28 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week disease progression every 6 month 5.5 year .</detailed_description>
