	<brief_summary>This research study study racial genetic biomarkers response tissue sample patient endometrial cancer . Studying sample tissue patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . DNA analysis tumor tissue may also help doctor predict well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Racial Genetic Biomarkers Response Tissue Samples From Patients With Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify racial categorization proportion genetic background African-American European-American woman endometrioid endometrial cancer ( EEC ) . II . To evaluate association racial genetic admixture clinicopathologic variable outcomes . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare concordance racial genetic admixture self-designated race categorization . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify race ( African-American v European-American ) disease stage ( I vs II v III v IV ) . DNA archive frozen normal tissue sample genotyped ancestry informative marker . Clinicopathological demographic characteristic associate sample also collect .</detailed_description>
