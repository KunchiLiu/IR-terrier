	<brief_summary>Diarrheal diseases third lead cause mortality world , nearly 2 million death annually among child age 5 year . Several clinical trial oral zinc supplementation perform develop country population confirm nutrient 's efficacy reduce severity frequency diarrhea . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend global use zinc supplementation child diarrhea despite little data trial industrialized/developed setting . In United States 4 million child suffer annually diarrheal illness . Although mortality significant factor U.S. case , 75 % case present medical care result 200,000 hospitalization annually diarrhea . This significant impact U.S. healthcare cost , average $ 391 per outpatient treatment $ 2,549 per inpatient treatment spend episode acute diarrheal illness . The goal study evaluate effectiveness oral zinc decrease duration diarrhea child treat outpatient decrease duration hospitalization child treat inpatient industrialized country . The result study promise substantial impact management common pediatric health problem , could conceivably affect direct indirect healthcare cost society .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In develop country , diarrheal disease lead cause childhood morbidity mortality . In United States estimate 4.67 million child per year suffer gastroenteritis diarrheal component , impact delivery cost healthcare . Seventy-five percent child bring physician care across range setting clinic emergency department . Children less five year age average 1.3 - 2.5 episode per year , 1.4 % child require hospitalization annually . This result estimate 209,000 hospitalization yearly gastroenteritis . The impact acute gastrointestinal disease felt developed world , include United States , cost attribute hospitalization productivity lose . Attempts treat gastroenteritis include Oral Rehydration Solution ( ORS ) , introduce 30 year ago WHO , continue provide safe effective way maintain hydration acute illness . ORS , however , reduce volume frequency stool output diarrhea . The anti-diarrheal medication loperamide ( ImmodiumÂ® ) commonly use child report serious adverse reaction cause use fall favor . There medication supplement available specifically treat diarrheal component gastroenteritis study show adherence treatment recommendation regard fluid therapy poor care giver want reduce duration illness oppose support child natural course disease . The desire relieve diarrheal symptom often lead care giver seek antibiotic time rise antibiotic resistance , well treatment proven efficacy . Zinc essential trace element human . Its physiologic role see throughout body critical cofactor enzymatic reaction ; notable action gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract . Zinc important component brush border enzymatic activity promote gastrointestinal absorption , regulate water/electrolyte transport cellular level , enhance repair intestinal mucosa bolster immune function . Over past 10-15 year , dozen randomize controlled trial zinc supplementation perform child live develop country report improvement duration severity diarrhea compare placebo variety in- outpatient setting . The majority zinc trial conduct country high risk zinc deficiency , conduct medium risk show similar effect duration severity . When stratify across nutritional group base serum zinc level significant effect see compare placebo despite baseline zinc level , occurrence serious adverse reaction group . Given result , WHO endorse zinc supplementation child acute diarrhea , despite lack data similarly design study industrialized/developed setting .</detailed_description>
