	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine new drug , RO4929097 , work cetuximab , drug already approve colorectal cancer , help fight patient 's cancer . Cancers arise result abnormal control gene expression . One pathways get abnormally regulate cancer Notch pathway . RO4929097 investigational drug block activation Notch pathway . It hop block abnormal activation , drug may helpful patient cancer investigator yet know true . Cetuximab antibody epidermal growth factor receptor know activity metastatic colorectal cancer . Recent study show people colorectal cancer contain mutation gene call K-ras benefit receive cetuximab . It unknown add RO4929097 cetuximab would benefit patient tumor mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Cetuximab With RO4929097 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination cetuximab RO4929097 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Safety tolerability combination cetuximab RO4929097 . II . Exploratory analyse anti-tumor effect combination . III . Laboratory correlatives explore response rate notch receptor ligand expression , correlation response toxicity profile expression EGFR pathway component , evaluation serum tissue marker gamma-secretase inhibitor activity . IV . Pharmacokinetic study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 . Phase I dose escalation : In part study , investigator try find high tolerate dose RO4929097 safely combine cetuximab . The investigator test two different cetuximab dos . One standard dose ( Arm A ) one little less standard dose ( Arm B ) . Everyone get treat cetuximab R04929097 part study . Phase I dose expansion : In part study , investigator take high tolerate dose find phase I part study test small number people colorectal cancer see activity combination drug . Everyone get treat cetuximab RO4929097 part study . This part study restrict patient whose tumor mutation K-ras gene . RO4929097 investigational anti-cancer agent yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use colorectal cancer . Cetuximab FDA approve metastatic colorectal cancer . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
