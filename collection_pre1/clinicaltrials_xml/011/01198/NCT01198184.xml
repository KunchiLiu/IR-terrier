	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) safety profile temsirolimus combination RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile drug administer combination order quantify expect interactive effect PK two agent . II . To evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect drug administer combination , goal identify potential predictive PD marker need exploration validation future trial . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day -6 ( course 1 ) . Patients receive temsirolimus IV orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor tissue sample may collect periodically pharmacokinetic correlative analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
