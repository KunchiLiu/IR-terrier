	<detailed_description>Recent study prove Phyllanthus Urinaria - Adenosmatis Glutinosum - Eclipta Prostrata - Ascorbic Acid combination plus Tenofovir treatment acute chronic hepatitis B . Method combination drug derive natural artificial medicament . To make clean job HBV - DNA patient 's body - hope new step medicine , long exist phrase `` chronic HBV infection `` Methods safety , therapeutic effect expect cost saving easily apply everyone everywhere world . According investigation must call , Chronic HBV infection important worldwide cause morbidity , mortality source potential new infection . There estimate 350 million carrier HBV world . In China , Southeast Asia sub-Saharan Africa , many 10-15 % population chronically infect . In North America Northern Europe , infection carrier rate much low , usually 1 % . Intermediate carrier rate 1-5 % find Southern Europe ( e.g. , Italy , Greece Spain ) , part South Central America , Middle East Japan . Persistent infection develop 90 % perinatally infected child 3-10 % people become infected age 6 year . Worldwide , estimate one million people die annually due HBV-related end stage diseases cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . The goal antiviral therapy hepatitis B reduce patient 's risk progressive liver disease prolong suppression eradication HBV infection arrest ameliorate HBV-related liver damage .</detailed_description>
