	<brief_summary>Cancer DNA disease characterize presence genetics alteration cancer cell . The recent study underline recur alteration must consider good molecular marker . In fact , could use tumor DNA detection different biological fluid . So , main purpose define presence circulate tumor DNA patient plasma colorectal cancer , presence mutation ( KRAS , NRAS , BRAF , APC , TP53 MIRCOSATELLIE instability ) . These molecular analysis do tumor plasma sample , This trial allow characterize prognostic value circulate tumoral DNA presence colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two major issue appear improve prognosis cancer patient , first early detection second risk recurrence early diagnosis recurrence order propose appropriate treatment patient . Cancer DNA disease characterized acquisition tumor cell carcinogenesis number recurrent genetic alteration . The development molecular tool easily characterize abnormality specific tumor cell , allow u consider use clinical practice . These genetic alteration could represent useful molecular marker detect presence tumor DNA various biological fluid include plasma cancer patient . This circulate tumor DNA , whose nature confirm similarity genetic alteration observe DNA extract tumor cell patient , represent molecular marker cancer available single sample could alternative use conventional marker CEA . We propose study confirm predictive value risk recurrence metastasis circulate tumor DNA plasma patient colorectal cancer cohort study ( 250 patient non-metastatic colorectal cancer ( Stage II III ) . This multicenter prospective study . The cohort patient follow minimum period 36 month . A biological analysis tumor search main genetic alteration colorectal cancer cell make ( KRAS , NRAS , TP53 , BRAF APC mutation well presence microsatellite instability ) . These genetic alteration seek plasma sample take surgery follow-up ( 9 sample total ) . The objective study 1/to assess prognostic value presence circulate tumor DNA plasma , search association risk presence genetic alteration plasma patient , 2/to search relationship initial rate circulate tumor DNA risk local recurrence,3/ characterize relationship type alteration plasma initial diagnosis circulate tumor DNA risk recurrence 4/ assess follow-up prognostic value occurrence tumor circulate DNA .</detailed_description>
