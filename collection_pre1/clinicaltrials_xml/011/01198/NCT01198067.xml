	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Pomalidomide design change immune system , may interfere development blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may reduce stop growth cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level pomalidomide base join study . Up 4 dose level pomalidomide test . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose pomalidomide find . Dosing Schedules/Study Drug Administration : You enrol one two dosing schedule ( Schedule A Schedule B ) base previous participant react study drug . - If Schedule A , take pomalidomide mouth 1 time night 28 day row . These 28 day make 1 `` study cycle '' . - If Schedule B , take pomalidomide mouth 1 time night 21 day row , follow 7-day `` rest period '' . You take study drug time every night . You take glass water empty stomach . Pomalidomide capsule swallow whole , broken , chew , open . Pomalidomide take without food , least 2 hour 2 hour meal . If dose pomalidomide miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . Rather , take next scheduled time point . Patients take prescribe dose pomalidomide instruct seek emergency medical care need contact study staff immediately . You bring unused pills/bottles study visit . You also take aspirin every day take pomalidomide help low chance side effect . Study Drug Diary : You give study drug diary beginning cycle . You bring complete diary study visit . You write miss vomited dos diary . If miss dose pomalidomide , take soon possible day . If miss dose entire day , try make take 2 dos next day . If vomit dose study drug , take another dose day double next dose . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask side effect drug may take . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect check status disease . You collect urine 24-hour period . You give container collect urine . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine take pregnancy test woman able child . On Days 8 22 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine take pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You ask side effect may drug may take . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine take pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . On Day 1 every odd cycle ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 ) : - If study doctor think need , may CT MRI scan brain check status disease . - You x-ray chest . - If study doctor think need , x-rays bone check bone lesion may . Starting Cycle 3 , follow test every 4 month first 2 year , year long study , study doctor think need : - You CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . If disease completely respond drug , bone marrow aspirate biopsy confirm complete response . Length Study : You able take pomalidomide long doctor think best interest . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect . End-of-Treatment ( discontinuation study drug ) : After take study , end-of-treatment visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask side effect may drug may take . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect check status disease . You collect urine 24-hour period . You give container collect urine . - You CT and/or MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - If study doctor think need , may CT MRI scan brain check status disease . - You x-ray chest . - You x-rays bone check bone lesion may . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine take pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . Safety assessment Visit After take study , safety assessment visit 30 day last dose study drug . The following test procedure perform : You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . Your performance status record . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . You ask side effect may . Follow-up Phone Call The study staff call every 6 month 1 year ask new treatment may start . The phone call take 5 minute .</detailed_description>
