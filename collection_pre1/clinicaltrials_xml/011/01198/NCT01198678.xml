	<brief_summary>Currently market CGM sensor approve functional lifetime 1 week . Pre-clinical study demonstrate GluSense-LTone 2e3 sensor may use accurately monitor glucose level 30 day . The purpose study assess safety functionality device human patient consecutive 15 day . GluSense-LTone 2e3 long term CGM , require less sensor replacement calibration , mean less patient intervention , therefore much user friendly . Moreover , GluSense-LTone 2e3 show potentially increase accuracy , especially critically important hypoglycemic range , mean well management patient 's condition may attain .</brief_summary>
