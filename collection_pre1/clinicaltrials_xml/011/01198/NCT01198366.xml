	<brief_title>Study AERAS-402 Healthy Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The currently available tuberculosis vaccine , bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) , estimate reduce risk tuberculosis ( TB ) child 70-80 % , protection incomplete . Efforts increase TB protection child include new vaccine primary immunization well combination vaccine give primary boosting vaccination . AERAS 402 live recombinant serotype 35 replication deficient adenovirus vector express fusion protein three Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) antigens ( Ag85A , Ag85B TB10.4 ) . It present Mtb antigen set new , live , replication-deficient adenovirus vaccine may increase T cell-mediated immunity thus protection tuberculosis . AERAS-402 appear safe immunogenic adult . Since BCG-vaccinated infant population AERAS-402 might indicate , AERAS-402 administer infant least 16 week age already vaccinate BCG . This first Phase II study AERAS-402 infant .</detailed_description>
