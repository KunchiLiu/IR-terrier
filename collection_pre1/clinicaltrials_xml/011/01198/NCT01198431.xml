	<brief_summary>The main aim study examine effect restrict sleep energy substrate metabolism well relevant hormonal system might involve underlying mechanism . The investigator hypothesize short-term sleep curtailment adolescent accompany 1 ) increase hunger desire eat ; 2 ) increase spontaneous energy intake ; 3 ) reduce spontaneous physical activity ; 4 ) increase fluctuation hormone way could favour positive energy balance potentially weight gain long run .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Impaired Sleep Energy Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The background project despite considerable knowledge mechanism regulate body weight , prevalence obesity decline . The individual environmental factor play part energy balance still completely understood , current method loose maintain body weight generally unsuccessful . Knowledge bring change metabolism lifestyle lacking . Reduced sleep duration observe parallel increase body weight . Lack sleep become hallmark modern man , child adult sleep less today decade ago . Research suggest much little sleep lead obesity , correlation sleep deprivation lifestyle-related ailment also observe . The reason correlation far clear , especially child adolescent . The main purpose SLOPUS investigate effect reduce sleep energy substrate metabolism , relevant hormonal system involve underlying mechanism . Our hypothesis acute sleep deprivation teenager lead increased hunger desire eat , increase spontaneous energy intake , decrease spontaneous physical activity , increase fluctuation hormone control energy metabolism . The investigator aim recruit twenty-four healthy , normal weight boy age 15-19 year normal sleep pat-terns . The study conduct randomize , crossover study two condition . Each participant subject short sleep ( 4 hour ) normal sleep ( 9 hour ) , random order , three consecutive night respiration chamber . They stay chamber 24 hour last night . In respiration chamber energy turnover measure - much energy also type substrate combust . The chamber equip bed , toilet , television , computer , communication . Food drink supply via airlock . Measurements chamber include volitional activity sleep duration/quality . Energy turnover measure use ventilate hood system first last day . Here participant lie bed head transparent canopy 25-minute interval morning . Blood sample also take period . Meal test serve , measure amount food ingest , subject give questionnaire hunger satiety fill . Physical activity heart rate measure throughout trial . Thus , present study likely result number new important finding regard impact impaired sleep energy balance might improve recommendation optimal sleep adolescent .</detailed_description>
