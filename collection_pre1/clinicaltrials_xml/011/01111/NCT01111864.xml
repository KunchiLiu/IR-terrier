	<brief_summary>Infants child two year group high rate iron deficiency anemia . Provision sufficient dietary iron age group challenge , in-home iron fortification complementary food use micronutrient powder effective approach . However , WHO recently caution untargeted use in-home micronutrient powder contain entire iron RDA child single dose area high rate infection malaria diarrheal disease . Therefore , study , investigate effect infant gut microbiota low dose ( ca . 25 % RDA ) highly bioavailable iron , provide micronutrient powder add complementary food . The study aim determine in-home fortification use iron-containing micronutrient powder Kenyan infant improve iron status and/or modify composition metabolic activity gut microbiota . Active surveillance do weekly monitor health infant . Our study do subgroup ( n=160 ) large double-blind control feed trial 330 infant randomize receive micronutrient powder contain either 2.5 mg iron iron 1 year . In substudy , infant study first 6 month 1 year intervention . Blood sample , take baseline 6 month use define iron status anemia level infant . Stool sample ( 2 baseline intervention , 6 throughout study additional sample case diarrhea ) obtain analysis gut microbiota . In entire study ( n=330 ) , measure change iron status 1 year .</brief_summary>
