	<detailed_description>There strong association smoking schizophrenia prevalence rate range 74 % 90 % , versus national average 30 % nonschizophrenic individual . A number hypothesis propose explain relationship high smoking rate schizophrenia , mostly relate self-medication primarily negative symptom schizophrenia . Smoking cessation rate among schizophrenic patient considerably low psychiatric disorder . The negative health effect smoke increase morbidity mortality schizophrenic patient . The smoking cessation agent bupropion HCl test schizophrenic , result efficacy inconclusive . Recent work different laboratory show safety efficacy varenicline , partial alpha4beta2 full alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist , smoke cessation agent . However , date , publish study test safety efficacy varenicline treatment nicotine dependence schizophrenic patient . As varenicline appear promising treatment non-psychiatric patient , would beneficial examine effect schizophrenic patient . The central hypothesis application treatment varenicline safely increase smoke abstinence rate schizophrenic patient compare receive placebo . This central hypothesis test objective application accomplish pursue two Specific Aims : 1 ) Treatment varenicline bupropion HCl period three month increase smoke abstinence rate schizophrenic patent compare placebo ; 2 ) Treatment varenicline bupropion HCl period three month increase psychosis schizophrenic patient compare placebo . For General Investigational Plan , employ double-blind randomized placebo control study ass varenicline 's safety efficacy . It expectation demonstrate varenicline safe effective decreasing smoking rate schizophrenic patient without exacerbate psychotic symptom . Such outcome significant , offer new treatment smoking cessation vulnerable population .</detailed_description>
