	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad STA-9090 colorectal cancer . This phase II trial test well drug work fight cancer well possible side effect patient . Cancer disease uncontrolled growth . This growth control part series proteins part growth pathway . Some protein destroy protein call HSP90 STA-9090 test drug block one protein help cancer grow . This study also look molecular marker may affect cancer grows , respond treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient histologically cytologicallyconfirmed colorectal cancer metastatic disease document diagnostic imaging study . The patient measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) , measure ≥20 mm conventional measurement technique ≥10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . The patient receive least one prior standard and/or investigational regimen metastatic disease . The patient age ≥18 year . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ( ECOG PS ) 01 ( Karnofsky≥ 80 % ) . The patient adequate hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count ≥1500/μL , hemoglobin ≥9/μdL , platelet count ≥100,000/μL . The patient adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin ≤ 2.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤3 x ULN ( ≤5 x ULN presence know liver metastasis ) . The patient , anticoagulation , adequate coagulation function define international normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤1.5 ULN partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) ≤1.5x ULN . Patients fulldose anticoagulation must stable dose oral anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin , must INR value within acceptable range treatment active bleeding pathological condition , opinion investigator , carry high risk bleeding . The patient adequate renal function define serum creatinine ≤1.5 x institutional ULN creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min patient creatinine level 1.5 , well urine protein ≤1+ routine analysis ( routine UA indicate ≥2+ protein , 24hour urine collection protein must demonstrate &lt; 1000mg protein 24 hour allow participation study ) . The patient life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Because teratogenicity STA9090 know , men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . The patient ability read willingness sign inform consent . For stage I protocol ( first 15 patient ) tumor must amenable biopsy patient must willing undergo pre post treatment biopsy . The patient must normal QTc interval baseline ECG , ( &lt; 470 millisecond , male female ) . Patient may receive chemotherapy within 4 week prior enter study , must recover ( grade 1 less ) adverse event due agent administer . Primary brain tumor active brain metastasis . However , patient history CNS metastases eligible treat stable 4 week completion treatment , image documentation require , must either steroid stable dose steroid minimum 2 week prior enrollment . History stroke within 6 month treatment significant neurological limitation . Major surgery within 4 week prior enter study . Poor venous access study drug administration would require peripheral central indwell catheter study drug administration . Study drug administration via indwell catheter prohibit time . Use investigational agent within 4 week prior enter study . History severe allergic reaction excipients ( e.g. , Polyethylene glycol 300 Polysorbate 80 ) , include severe hypersensitivity reaction define ≥ Grade 3 base NCI CTCAE version 3 . Treatment chronic immunosuppressant ( e.g. , cyclosporine follow transplantation systemic steroid treatment autoimmune disease ) . However , patient may receive steroid stable CNS metastasis describe exclusion criterion 2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , ventricular arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Other medication , severe acute/chronic medical psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Ventricular ejection fraction ( Ef ) ≤ 45 % . Inaccessible tissue biopsy ( first 15 patient ) History current coronary artery disease , myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , angioplasty coronary bypass surgery History current uncontrolled dysrhythmias , requirement antiarrhythmic medication , Grade 2 great leave bundle branch block New York Heart Association class II/III/IV congestive heart failure history dyspnea , orthopnea edema require current treatment angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin II receptor blocker , betablockers diuretics Current prior radiation therapy leave hemithorax</criteria>
