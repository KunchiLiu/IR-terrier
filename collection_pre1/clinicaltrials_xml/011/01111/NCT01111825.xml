	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety benefit two new drug treatment breast cancer . The patient eligible study breast cancer grow spite standard treatment . The two drug test study , Neratinib Temsirolimus , give together . Also , study help investigator learn therapy direct HER2 sometimes stop work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Plus Neratinib Patients With Metastatic HER2-Amplified Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I Design A standard , 3+3 , dose escalation schedule use . Between 6 12 patient likely necessary determine MTD temsirolimus combination neratinib . There intrapatient dose escalation . The start dose temsirolimus 8 mg administer intravenously weekly ( dose level 1 ) . Three patient initially enrol cohort . The Phase I portion close enrollment . Phase II Design The phase II portion trial comprise two cohorts—HER2-amplified triple negative breast cancer—each Simon two-stage design determine efficacy temsirolimus administer combination neratinib . Both pathologic subtypes patient study separately though accrual simultaneous . Response ( RECIST criterion ) assess every 8 week ( every 2 cycle ) start therapy . As 2/10/12 , Triple-negative cohort close accrual . The HER2- amplify cohort continue enroll plan total 34 patient .</detailed_description>
