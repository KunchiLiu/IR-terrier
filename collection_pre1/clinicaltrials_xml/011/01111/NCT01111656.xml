Identifier : NCT00942591 ) SWABIMS evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability atorvastatin 40 mg addition interferon-beta 1b compare interferon-beta 1b monotherapy patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 15 month .

	<detailed_description>Background Multiple sclerosis chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease central nervous system . Statins lipid-lowering drug inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA- ) reductase , main regulatory enzyme cholesterol biosynthesis . In recent year many study demonstrate , statins anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory property addition lipid-lowering effect . Therefore , statin may therapeutic potential immune-mediated disorder multiple sclerosis . Studies experimental allergic encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) , animal model human demyelinate disease multiple sclerosis , well small study patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis show beneficial effect course disease . But also report negative impact statins multiple sclerosis . Therefore , big study need investigate therapeutical potential statin multiple sclerosis . Objective To assess efficacy , safety tolerability combination atorvastatin 40mg p.o . daily interferon-beta 1b sc e.o.d compare monotherapy interferon-beta-1b sc e.o.d patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 12 month complete SWABIMS study . Methods Multi-center , rater-blinded , parallel-group , two arm , randomize study . Patients relapsing-remitting form MS , respect inclusion/exclusion criterion , randomize SWABIMS study two equal-size parallel arm three month treatment interferon-beta 1b , receive atorvastatin 40mg/d addition interferon-beta 1b 12 month . After successful completion study , patient ask participate `` SWABIMS Follow study '' another 12 month ongoing medication .</detailed_description>
