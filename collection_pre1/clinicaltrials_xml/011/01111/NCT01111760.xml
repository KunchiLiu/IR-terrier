	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare radiation exposure variety chest CT examination perform current state art CT scanner ( 64 slice , dual source CT scanner ) radiation exposure identical chest CT examination perform Siemens Flash CT scanner ( high pitch dual source spiral technique ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Dose From Computed Tomography Before After Implementation High Pitch Dual Spiral Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computed tomography emerge `` gold standard '' diagnosis broad range medical diagnosis . For cardiac image alone , installation CT scanners US cardiology practice alone triple past 2 year . Patients undergo cardiac CTA ( compute tomography angiography ) may subject relatively high dos ionize radiation ( ie . 4 time annual background radiation ) diagnosis management coronary artery disease . Current radiation dos cardiac CT examination comparable effective dos patient undergo nuclear stress test cardiac catheterization ( ie . approximately 10-15 milliSieverts ) . In addition , non cardiac CT protocol , chest CT examination evaluation pulmonary artery , thoracic abdominal aorta , lung nodule , associate significant radiation exposure . Many patient undergo repeat CT examination several year pathology . There grow public concern regard cancer risk associate radiation . Recent major technological advance make advent new generation CT scanner allow significant radiation dose reduction . One scanner , dual source CT , new high pitch dual source spiral technique offer ability image patient 's chest ECG gate imaging protocol within single second . These technological advance allow significant radiation dose saving , often result effective radiation dose less one millisievert ( mSv ) .</detailed_description>
