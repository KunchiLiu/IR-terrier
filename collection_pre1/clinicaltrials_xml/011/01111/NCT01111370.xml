	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness G4 System wear 7-days subject &gt; 18 years-old diabetes mellitus require insulin . Device performance primarily evaluate term proportion G4 System value within ±20 % YSI reference value glucose level &gt; 80 mg/dL ±20 mg/dL meter glucose level &lt; 80 mg/dL . These G4-YSI match pair collect in-clinic session Days 1 , 4 , 7 Sensor wear . The proportion match pair study ( PTL-900360 ) meeting criterion compare proportion point observe DexCom clinical study support approval SEVEN PLUS System ( PTL 300012 ) . Safety data G4 System also collect safety characterize incidence Adverse Device Effects , Serious Adverse Device Events , Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects experience study participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , single-armed study conduct United States . Following screening , minimum 60 maximum 80 subject 4 clinical site enrol . All participant wear G4 Sensor one 7-day wear period ( ~168 hour ) . A subset 20-30 subject wear two G4 Systems ( one blind ) 7-day wear period purpose assess precision . During home use , subject ask use meter provide take fingersticks calibration diabetes management . Subjects also ask confirm high low G4 System glucose alerts/alarms take comparative fingerstick immediately receive alert/alarm . All subject participate one , 8-hour in-clinic session Day 1 , 4 , 7 study collect accuracy information laboratory standard ( YSI ) SMBG . During in-clinic session , subject venous blood draw evaluation YSI blood glucose measurement . Carbohydrate consumption insulin dosing may manipulate in-clinic session ensure wide range glucose value . For duration study , subject instruct use G4 System information adjunct ( replacement ) standard SMBG guidance diabetes self-management . Subjects perform G4 Sensor insertion clinic supervision study staff . Sensor insertion site examine removal Sensor ( ) . Study staff document irritation and/or Adverse Device Effects .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 18 year old ; 2 . Have diagnose insulinrequiring diabetes multiple daily injection ( MDI ) Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII ) insulin therapy ; 3 . Willing inject insulin wear insulin pump insertion set within 3 inch Sensor site Sensor wear ; 4 . Willing use blood glucose meter provide selfmonitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) Sensor wear ; 5 . Willing participate one , 8hour inclinic session willing take 4 fingersticks per hour 4 blood draw per hour entire 8hour duration ; 6 . Willing take minimum 6 fingersticks per day home use ( 2 calibration purpose , 4 comparative purpose ) ; 7 . Willing refrain use acetaminophen Sensor insertion period least 24hours prior Sensor insertion ; 8 . Willing schedule magnetic resonance ( MRI ) scan , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , xray , duration study ; 9 . Able speak , read , write English . 1 . Have extensive skin changes/diseases preclude wear Sensor normal skin ( e.g . extensive psoriasis , recent burn severe sunburn , extensive eczema , extensive scarring , extensive tattoo , dermatitis herpetiformis ) propose wear site ; 2 . Subjects know allergy medicalgrade adhesive ; 3 . Are pregnant demonstrate positive pregnancy test within 72 hour insertion ; 4 . Have hematocrit less 30 % , great 55 % ; 5 . Current participation another investigational study protocol ( subject recently complete participation another drug study , subject must complete study least 30 day prior enrol study ) ; 6 . Have condition , opinion Investigator , would interfere participation trial pose excessive risk study staff handle venous blood sample ( e.g. , known history hepatitis B C ) .</criteria>
