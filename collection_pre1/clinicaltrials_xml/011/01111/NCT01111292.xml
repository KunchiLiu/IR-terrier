	<brief_summary>This pilot , randomize phase I/II trial study well inositol work prevent colorectal cancer patient abnormal cell ( dysplasia ) associate inflammation colon ( colitis ) . Patients colitis-associated dysplasia may increase risk develop colorectal cancer . Inositol vitamin-like substance may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect myo-inositol ( inositol ) , administer 3 month , phospho ( P ) -beta ( B ) -catenin stain area low-grade dysplasia area prior low grade dysplasia subject know colitis-induced low grade dysplasia baseline . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine effect myo-inositol regression dysplasia . II . To examine effect inositol p53 Ki67 stain within remain dysplasia . III . To examine effect inositol epithelial apoptosis ( cleave caspase-3 ) within dysplasia . IV . To examine effect inositol reduction mucosal messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) level monocyte chemotactic protein 1 ( MCP1 ) , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , cyclooxygenase ( Cox ) -2 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Beginning within 14 day colonoscopy , patient receive inositol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 twice daily ( BID ) day 15-90 . ARM II : Beginning within 14 day colonoscopy , patient receive placebo PO QD day 1-14 BID day 15-90 . After completion treatment , patient undergo biopsy colonoscopy without mucosal resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
