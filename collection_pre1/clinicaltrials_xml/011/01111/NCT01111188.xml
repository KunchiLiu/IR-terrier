	<brief_summary>Mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) characterize cell cycle dysregulation . PD 0332991 cyclin-dependent kinase 4 6 inhibitor capable inhibiting cell cycle MCL . A phase I study demonstrated safety anti-lymphoma activity PD 0332991 . Bortezomib first generation proteasome inhibitor approve treatment patient recurrent MCL . Preclinical data suggest PD 0332991 bortezomib may act synergistically MCL . PD 0332991 administer continuously 12 day follow 9 day period without treatment . Bortezomib administer intravenous bolus day 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 cycle . One cycle define three week . A maximum ten cycle administer .</brief_summary>
