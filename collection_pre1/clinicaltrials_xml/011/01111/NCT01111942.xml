	<brief_summary>This non-randomized open-label investigator initiate pilot study compare follow-up therapy advance head neck cancer subject initially treated triple induction chemotherapy . Subjects receive surgical treatment combine chemoradiation therapy base subject 's apparent clinical response . Spared use radiation therapy selective patient complete response induction chemotherapy could improve well patient population without compromise survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Induction Chemotherapy Followed Surgery Locally Advanced Resectable Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An important observation induction triple chemotherapy regimen know TPF unprecedented high proportion patient treat complete response disease upon completion induction phase . In recent study Haddad , et al. , biopsy perform patient follow induction chemotherapy start concomitant chemoradiotherapy . Patients incomplete response chemoradiotherapy N3 disease neck dissection 6 12 week chemoradiotherapy . Twenty-nine neck dissection perform chemoradiotherapy . The neck dissection result pathologically positive 7 ( 24 % ) patient ( alive evidence disease ) negative 22 ( 76 % ) patient ( 21 alive evidence disease ) . Post-TPF , primary site biopsy result negative 64 patient ( 89 % ) positive 8 patient ( 11 % ) . While protocol require patient subsequently receive concomitant chemoradiation regardless disease response induction component regimen , reasonable question whether complete responder subset really need undergo intensive chemoradiation treatment compare partial responder . Thus , less intense therapy may sufficient . The long term goal protocol alter model highly effective cancer therapy maximally tolerate patient minimally necessary cure . One treatment strategy patient advanced head neck cancer prove highly sensitive chemotherapy combine modality polychemotherapy conservation surgery goal avoid radiation therapy . For patient whose primary disease classify T2-3 ( resectable ) , complete response follow induction therapy , feasible perform organ preservation tumor nidusectomy primary site verify clinical complete response truly pathological complete response . Similarly , clinical complete response observe associate nodal disease , verify pathologically perform selective neck dissection without cause significant morbidity . Both tumor nidusectomy selective neck dissection show effective adjuvant setting . Building observation , novel protocol outline proposal potential spare use radiation therapy selective patient complete response induction chemotherapy thereby improve well without compromise survival .</detailed_description>
