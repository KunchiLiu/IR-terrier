	<brief_title>A Prospective , Multi-centric Observational Study Determine Mono-bifollicular Development Infertile Women Subjected Ovulation Induction With Follitropin Î±</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In woman infertility due anovulation , main purpose ovulation induction ( OI ) consist induce mono bifollicular subsequent ovulation order achieve pregnancy . The availability recombinant gonadotropin obtain use genetically engineer technique meant decisive clear pharmacological advancement . Use recombinant human follicle stimulate hormone ( r-hFSH ) offer great effectiveness ( great number follicles/ ovocytes high pregnancy rate ) efficiency ( few number blister , few stimulation day ; few number cancellation complication ) program coitus artificial insemination like in-vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) /intra cytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) technique . Further advance obtain good product ovarian stimulation lead production recombinant FSH ( follitropin alpha ) fill mass preparation . This hormone become consistent precise gonadotropin due improvement quantification process . Today , despite accurate modern tool ovulation induction , daily practice , doctor continue `` fight '' two old problem assist reproduction : multiple pregnancy ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) . Application assist reproduction technique ( ARTs ) use medication induce ovulation , risk produce gestation multiple birth higher frequency observe spontaneous gestation . One facts result appearance problem high incidence polycystic ovarian syndrome among population woman infertile due anovulation . These subject especially sensitive ovarian stimulation , lead multiple follicular development , high risk hyperstimulation high rate multiple pregnancy . Therefore , seem clear search develop mono bifollicular cycle important ovarian induction cycle , purpose preventing mention multiple pregnancy problem risk OHSS . The intent study figure real mono-bifollicular development rate obtain normal care condition follow OI treatment follitropin alpha fill mass prescribe accordance standard practice . Therefore , measure efficiency product achieve development one two follicle . Data collect 56 centre Autonomous Communities accept observational study , achieve total 410 ovulation induction cycle . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To find real proportion cycle mono-bifollicular development provision care involve OI follitropin alpha fill mass Secondary objective : - To evaluate use follitropin alpha fill mass clinical benefit reduction number cancel cycle , dosage time require adverse effect</detailed_description>
