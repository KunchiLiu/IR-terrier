	<brief_summary>Background : - Loa loa parasitic worm infect people West Central Africa spread bite deerfly . Adult worm ( macrofilariae ) live skin cause symptom swelling , itch , hive . Smaller worm ( microfilariae ) find bloodstream . Diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) , recommend medication Loa loa infection , produce serious side effect , especially people high number parasite blood . Researchers investigate new treatment Loa loa few less serious side effect . - DEC standard treatment Loa loa infection , cause mild side effect person low number parasite blood , include itchiness , muscle joint pain , swell face limb . Currently , way effectively prevent side effect . - Researchers believe certain kind blood cell call eosinophil , increase blood DEC treatment , may one cause side effect see DEC treatment . Reslizumab drug help prevent increase eosinophils blood . Giving reslizumab DEC treatment might prevent eosinophil increase thereby might reduce side effect DEC . Objectives : - To determine whether reslizumab prevent reduce side effect treatment DEC Loa loa infestation . - To evaluate effect reslizumab part treatment Loa loa infestation . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year age live traveled loa-endemic region least 1 month . ( Loa-endemic region include northern Angola , Cameroon , Central African Republic , People Republic Congo , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Nigeria , Democratic Republic Congo . ) - Participants must low number parasites blood , determine screen part study . Design : - This study last 24 month involve several visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants screen blood test Loa loa parasite . Those low number Loa loa parasite blood ask return full medical evaluation start treatment phase . Those Loa loa parasite blood , high number Loa loa parasite blood , eligible study treatment may eligible parasitic disease study conduct National Institutes Health . - Participants initial visit full physical evaluation , blood urine test ( include leukapheresis provide sufficient number blood cell test ) . - Within 1 month first visit , participant single infusion either reslizumab placebo . The infusion visit estimate last approximately 5 hour . - Three 7 day infusion , participant begin 21-day course DEC ( take mouth ) treat infection . Participants stay overnight Clinical Center first 3 day treatment DEC monitor side effect , continue take DEC home inpatient treatment . A study coordinator call participant day ask symptom side effect . - Participants see additional eight outpatient follow-up visit ( day 7 , 14 , 28 , month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 ) evaluation sign symptoms infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Placebo-controlled , Double-blind Pilot Study Single-dose Humanized Anti-IL5 Antibody ( Reslizumab ) Reduction Eosinophilia Following Diethylcarbamazine Treatment Loa Loa Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diethylcarbamazine citrate ( DEC ) treatment Loa loa infection complicate development severe adverse reaction correlate number circulate microfilariae blood . The cause reaction unknown , accompanied dramatic interleukin-5 ( IL-5 ) -dependent increase eosinophilia evidence eosinophil activation . This randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind pilot study ( conduct NIH Clinical Center ) ass whether extent administration reslizumab ( Cinquil ) , humanize monoclonal antibody direct IL-5 , give 3 7 day administration anthelminthic drug DEC ( 3 mg/kg 3 time daily 21 day ) , prevent development eosinophilia 10 adult subject Loa loa infection 0-5000 microfilariae/mL . Secondary outcome include severity post-treatment effect , marker eosinophil activation , effect reslizumab microfilarial clearance .</detailed_description>
