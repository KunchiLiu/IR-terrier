	<brief_summary>The objective evaluate whether use expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) reduce electrical activity sternocleidomastoid muscle enhances action muscle patient parasternal port Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease . Noting also , set pressure level ( 10 15 cmH2O ) affect relationship .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity Inspiratory Muscles With Use Positive Pressure Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterize chronic obstruction airflow , lead respiratory muscle overload great activation accessory muscle respiration , especially active inspiratory phase . It believe positive expiratory pressure ( EPAP ) reduce respiratory work , produce less activation muscle . Thus , evaluate behavior electrical activity inspiratory muscle COPD patient response application expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) , observe influence pressure level inspiratory muscle recruitment . This implemented clinical single blind trial ( blinded gauge outcome ) develop Department Pneumology , Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) . Will evaluate COPD patient clinical diagnosis pathology , gender age 40 70 year . In first day collect anthropometric data , perform lung function test stag pathology muscle strength test . These individual return evaluate electromyographic activity sternocleidomastoid ( SCM ) , parasternal , right hemisphere . This evaluation consist measurement breathe rest ( control ) , implementation EPAP mask 10 15 cmH2O ( state intervention ) 10 minute removal . To test lung function assess use spirometer lung capacity compare predicted literature . As electrical activity muscle , observed percentage activation obtain high activity ( % RMS ) . Thus , expect implementation EPAP promote reduction electrical activity muscle ECM leverage action parasternal muscle , affected dynamic hyperinflation . It also hop use blood pressure level 15 cmH2O , compare 10 cmH2O , leverage effect EPAP muscle interest . The surface electromyographic evaluation method relatively inexpensive noninvasive , effective evaluate electrical potential lie muscle membrane . So , describe effect EPAP inspiratory muscle , important guide treatment COPD patient use positive airway pressure therapy .</detailed_description>
