The goal study evaluate efficacy safety dietary supplement N-Acetylcysteine adolescent age 13-21 deliberate self-harm behavior . There additional neuroimaging component expand knowledge regard neural correlate treatment study population . We hypothesize N-Acetylcysteine reduce severity deliberate self harm behavior supplement helpful treating disorder share similar trait DSH . We use medication 40 young people deliberately harm ass severity behavior treat dietary supplement . We also collect neuroimaging data study participant baseline treatment N-Acetylcysteine compare 40 age-matched healthy peer neuroimaging data . The purpose include healthy group expand knowledge neural correlate study population prior treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deliberate Self-Harm ( DSH ) among adolescent serious behavioral problem associate significant morbidity mortality , impaired functioning , reduce quality life , high rate psychiatric hospitalization . Rates DSH among high-school adolescent range 14 % 21 % , highlight need effective behavioral pharmacological intervention . Because DSH closely link Borderline Personality Disorder ( BPD ) , treatment use successfully BPD Dialectical Behavior Therapy ( DBT ) use treat adolescent DSH . While DSH show direct link suicide attempt , clear link individual engage DSH overall rate suicide . In addition high rate DSH adolescent , research continue show similar adult patient ; adolescent DSH relate high level impulsivity . Considerable advance understand neurobiology risk reward impulsivity improve general understanding neuropathology behavior DSH . Our previous neuroimaging research DSH BPD find frontal white matter integrity significantly impaired individual . One conceptualization DSH represent imbalance strong desire reward DSH ( i.e . overactive ventral tegmental area [ VTA ] ) inability inhibit drive ( i.e . impaired inferior frontal cortex ) . If frontal cortex impair due inadequate white matter integrity earlier study demonstrate , reduce drive DSH may beneficial target treatment . Glutamate known activate dopamine neuron VTA . Because activation increase dopamine release mesocorticolimbic target , glutamate-dopamine interaction VTA may underlie chronic reward-seeking underlies DSH . In fact , dysregulated prefrontal cortex-nucleus accumbens synaptic glutamate transmission appear underlie unmanageable motivation engage DSH . Because interaction glutamate dopaminergic system within VTA mediate reward , N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) , glutamate modulating agent , attenuate reward property DSH interfere DSH-induced stimulation mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway . NAC increase activity cysteine-glutamate antiporters nucleus accumbens abolishes reward-seeking behavior . Behaviorally , NAC administration lead diminish urges engage DSH . Increased extracellular glutamate NAC may correct underlie pathophysiology symptom compulsive drive self-injure . NAC extensively study variety medical problem ( e.g. , cocaine dependence , acetaminophen overdose , AIDS , gamble ) , lack significant side effect may present marked advantage pharmacological agent . There need develop effective treatment option well tolerate , widely available , prohibitive cost . NAC amino acid , available health food store , cheap cost insurance co-payments , easily tolerate . If effective , NAC could treatment option available people throughout country currently insurance suffer DSH . The population study trial 40 men woman , age 13-21 , engage deliberate self-harm behavior least twice month . We also add sample 40 match healthy adolescent serve comparison group baseline neuroimaging measure . Study participant recruit outpatient mental health clinic community advertisement . The study consist two component : treatment N-acetyl cysteine brain imaging . Participants invited participate either , depend distinct eligibility criterion two component ( see . ) Treatment component : The treatment component study consist eight week open label N-Acetylcysteine ( NAC ) . All eligible study subject treat 600mg NAC twice day 2 week , dose increase 1200mg twice day two week , 1800mg twice day 4 week . week . Subjects see every two week 8-week study . Efficacy safety assessment perform visit . Imaging component : A brain imaging session take place treatment NAC . For individual either choose compete treatment component meet entry criterion , baseline scan . The healthy group participate assessment neuroimaging , treatment second scan . All participant undergo comprehensive clinical assessment include follow interviews/rating scales/tests : 1 . KSADS interview ( adolescent parent ) SCID ( adult participant ) 2 . Child Depression Rating Scale-Revised ( CDRS-R ) 3 . Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) ( patient ) 4 . Inventory Statements About Self-Harm ( ISAS ) ( patient ) 5 . The Deliberate Self Harm Inventory ( DSHI ) ( patient ) 6 . Deliberate Self Harm Questionnaire ( DSHQ ) ( patient ) 7 . Beck Depression Inventory-II ( BDI-11 ) 8 . Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence ( WASI ) 9 . Edinburgh Handedness inventory 10 . Iowa Gambling Task ( IGT ) 11 . NIH Toolbox 12 . Tanner Questionnaire 13 . Eating Questionnaire ( EDEQ ) 14 . Personality Assessment Inventory ( PAI ) 15 . Symptom Check-List-90-R ( SCL-90 ) 16 . Barrett Impulsivity Scale ( BIS ) 17 . Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale ( DERS ) 18 . Satisfaction Life Questionnaire 19 . Toronto Alexithymia scale 20 . Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire - Adolescent ( RSQ-A ) All participant invite undergo MRI session include structural scan , rest state fMRI scan , emotion task fMRI scan , diffusion tensor imaging , magnetic resonance spectroscopy anterior cingulate cortex . Every two week follow assessment utilized assess efficacy current treatment NAC participant : 1 . Inventory Statements About Self-Injury Since Last Visit version ( ISAS - SLV ) 2 . Self-Injury Assessment Scale ( SIAS ) 3 . Deliberate Self Harm Inventory Clinical Change Version ( DSHI - CCV ) 4 . Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Since Last Visit version ( CSSRS - SLV ) At end 8 week administration NAC participant complete : 1 . Inventory Statements About Self-Injury Since Last Visit version ( ISAS - SLV ) 2 . Self-Injury Assessment Scale ( SIAS ) 3 . Deliberate Self Harm Inventory Clinical Change Version ( DSHI - CCV ) 4 . Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale Since Last Visit version ( CSSRS - SLV ) 5 . Barrett Impulsivity Scale ( BIS ) 6 . SCL-90 7 . DERS 8 . Satisfaction Life Questionnaire 9 . BDI-II 10 .
