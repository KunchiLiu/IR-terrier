	<brief_summary>Functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) effective treatment sinus disease . FESS carry use camera view surgical field . Bleeding surgery lead poor surgical field visualization . Poor visualization associate worse surgical outcome . Tranexamic acid safe effective agent use achieve hemostasis operative procedure . The current study randomize control trial patient undergo FESS compare effect tranexamic acid versus placebo effect surgical field visualization adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : The current study ass effect tranexamic acid intraoperative bleeding surgical outcome functional endoscopic sinus surgery . Background : Tranexamic acid antifibrinolytic prevents activation plasminogen plasmin . Plasmin responsible degradation fibrin clot . This mechanism tranexamic acid prevents blood clot breakdown reduces operative bleeding . Functional endoscopic sinus surgery , FESS , widely use surgical technique treat sinusitis disease nose nasal cavity . Bleeding FESS hinder surgical progress associate increase complication . Methods : The current study randomize , double-blind placebo- control . Study sample size calculate base previous study topical intranasal TA . Participants undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery recruit study preoperative outpatient clinic visit . Each participant randomize group receive either tranexamic acid normal saline bolus immediately prior operation . Inclusion criterion study follow : patient must diagnose either 1 . Chronic rhinosinusitis polyposis ( CRSwP ) 2 . Chronic hyperplastic sinusitis . Patients must ASA classification I II must undergo bilateral FESS treatment one diagnose . Exclusion criterion include patient hypertension ( treat untreated ) , thrombotic diathesis , vascular disease , risk factor vascular disease , colorblindness , renal failure , may pregnant . These exclusion criterion base potential risk use tranexamic acid patient ( see safety data information section ) . The exclusion criterion hypertension include anyone diagnose previously hypertension anti-hypertensive medication diagnosis . The hypertensive patient exclude due difficulty maintain standardized anesthesia protocol ( mean arterial pressure ) patient . The author current study test pregnancy . Patients ask date last menstrual period per standard pre-operative questionnaire , patient may pregnant would exclude trial would undergo general anesthetic elective procedure due risk preterm labour . The diagnosis renal failure determine patient history , current study require systematic lab diagnosis calculate renal function . The study keep record surgeon ( ) resident present surgery evaluate potential difference data analysis . The study blind surgeon ( ) anesthesiologist patient receive . The day schedule operation patient enrol study , pharmacy determine patient receive TA placebo base randomization table . The bolus TA prepare accord patient weight ( 15mg/kg load dose ) . The patient receive placebo receive infusion normal saline volume . Patients receive TA saline infusion call operating room , approximately 30 minute onset operation . The patient would also receive continuous infusion 1mg/kg per hour TA preparation normal saline duration operation . The current study use standardize anesthesia protocol use universally accept parameter . The operation carry use primarily inhalational anesthetic . End- tidal CO2 maintain target range 30-35 mmHg . The head bed elevated 15 degree . The target range mean arterial pressure 60-70 mmHg . Outcome Measures : The outcome measure current study follow : 1 . The Wormald grade scale , validate instrument use assess intraoperative bleed video endoscopy sinus surgery . Dr. Wright apply Wormald grade scale intraoperatively . 2 . Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy ( POSE ) score system , systematic visualization evaluation sinus . 3 . Lund- Kennedy endoscopic reporting system , validate stag system sinus disease . 4 . Lund- MacKay CT score , use radiologic evaluation sinus disease , 5 . Number sinuses sinus involve operative procedure . 6 . Surgical time . 7 . Total blood loss ( monitor suction blood monitoring sponge throat pack use operation . 8 . Completeness surgical procedure affect bleeding .</detailed_description>
