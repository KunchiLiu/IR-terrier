	<brief_summary>Combining Erb inhibitor , lapatinib , TS inhibitor , capecitabine , may beneficial contribution current treatment paradigm since preclinical data suggest lapatinib alone decrease TS mRNA synergistic capecitabine cell line , may contribute clinical benefit . The study describe protocol design establish anti-tumor activity Lapatinib without capecitabine treatment Her2 overexpressing metastatic gastric- gastro-esophageal cancer , search molecular correlate may associate response compound . The majority patient metastatic gastric gastro-esophageal cancer undergo first-line combine chemotherapy ( e.g . platin derivates fluoropyrimidines , sometimes combine taxane ) , role second-line chemotherapy yet define . Therefore , progression shortly first-line chemotherapy medical condition standard medical approach exists . The overexpression EGFR Her2 gastric gastroesophageal cancer make indication prime candidate treatment dual ErbB1/2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) Lapatinib .</brief_summary>
