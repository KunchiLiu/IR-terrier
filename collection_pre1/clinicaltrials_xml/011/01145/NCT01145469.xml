	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample DNA laboratory patient receive fludarabine-based treatment may help doctor learn effect fludarabine cell . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study study DNA sample patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia previously treat fludarabine-based therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers DNA Samples From Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Previously Treated With Fludarabine-Based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify genetic characteristic associate efficacy toxicity fludarabine-based treatment patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia participate E2997 . - To validate genetic characteristic cancer cell model system confirm association dissect mechanism effect . OUTLINE : Archived DNA sample analyze genetic characteristic associate efficacy toxicity fludarabine-based treatment use Affymetrix 6.0 single nucleotide polymorphism array . The result compare data gene identify cancer cell model system , clinical data ( response , toxicity , overall survival , progression-free survival ) associate patient sample .</detailed_description>
