	<brief_summary>Many primary care patient , especially inner-city setting , achieve target blood pressure glycemic control . There urgent need enhance treatment reach goal within usual clinical care system . We propose develop multi-component intervention ground Chronic Care Model , sustainable resource-challenged setting . Through collaboration home health nursing use home telemetry feedback intensification therapy , augment usual clinical service improve health outcome diabetes patient able reach therapeutic goal . There three specific aim . First , establish feasible , practical sustainable collaborative model primary care sit practice-based research network ( NYC RING ) , clinical researcher Diabetes Research Training Center , The Montefiore Home Health Organization , integrate unique expertise partner define role responsibility . Second , develop refine component intervention , include train primary care provider home health nurse integrate technical , psychosocial communication process implementation intervention . Third , assess feasibility collaborative intervention implement intervention 25 primary care patient obtain preliminary estimate effectiveness compare outcomes 25 patient receive usual care . Our proposal include plan develop feasible procedure data collection , qualitative quantitative method assess process outcome measure . We use preliminary data revise intervention prepare R18 application develop test intervention multiple inner-city primary care sit serve low-income diabetes patient . This proposal secondary prevention diabetes complication , target population know health disparity high burden chronic disease .</brief_summary>
