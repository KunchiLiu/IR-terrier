	<brief_title>A Comparison Between Signature Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) Conventional TKA Computer Assisted TKA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study report compare outcomes patient undergo total knee arthroplasty utilize 'SignatureTM Personalised Patient Care ' , Conventional Total Knee Arthroplasty Computer Assisted Navigation . The 'SignatureTM Personalised Patient Care ' system use patient 's Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) X-ray design build surgical instrument customize patient 's unique knee anatomy . Cutting position guide produce match outer shape individual 's distal femur proximal tibia . The cut positioning guide intend use patient-specific surgical instrumentation assist position total knee replacement component intra-operatively guide mark bone cutting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient legal age skeletally mature Patient require primary total knee arthroplasty due non inflammatory degenerative joint disease ( e.g . osteoarthritis , traumatic arthritis , vascular necrosis , dysplasia/DDH ) inflammatory joint disease ( e.g. , Rheumatoid arthritis ) . Patient meet acceptable preoperative medical clearance free treat cardiac , pulmonary , haematological , etc. , condition would pose excessive operative risk The patient available follow throughout duration study . Patient unable MRI scan due follow condition : Cardiac pacemaker Surgical clip head ( aneurysm clip ) Some artificial heart valves Electronic inner ear implant Metal fragment eye Electronic stimulators Implanted pumps Patient active infection sepsis ( treat untreated ) Patient vascular insufficiency , muscular atrophy , neuromuscular disease severe enough compromise implant stability postoperative recovery . Patient female childbearing age take contraceptive precaution . Patient inadequate bone stock support device ( e.g . severe osteopenia , family history severe osteoporosis osteopenia ) . Patient known moderate severe renal insufficiency . Patient know suspect metal sensitivity . Patient immunosuppressed receive high dos corticosteroid .
