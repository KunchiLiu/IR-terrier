	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 give together gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient advance solid tumor . Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 together gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety profile establish maximum-tolerated dose recommend phase II dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 combination gemcitabine hydrochloride patient advance solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetic profile gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 give combination gemcitabine hydrochloride correlate pharmacokinetic profile toxicity biological activity . II . To assess antitumor activity gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 gemcitabine hydrochloride patient advance solid tumor . III . To correlate expression biomarkers Notch signal archival tumor tissue antitumor activity gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 combination gemcitabine hydrochloride . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 . Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Plasma blood sample may collect periodically pharmacokinetic study biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 1 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
