	<brief_summary>Background : - Plaquenil ( hydroxychloroquine ) anti-inflammatory drug use treat autoimmune diseases lupus rheumatoid arthritis . This drug damage retina cause condition call plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity , may lead vision loss . However , people take plaquenil develop problem . Researchers interested study whether difference person gene explain people develop plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity others . Objectives : - To investigate possible correlation certain gene genetic mutation plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age previously use plaquenil . - Both individual develop plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity eligible study . Design : - The study require one two visit National Eye Institute outpatient study clinic maximum 2-year period . - Participants provide personal family medical history , full eye examination . - Participants also provide blood sample test . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genotype-Phenotype Study Patients With Plaquenil -Induced Retinal Toxicity , With Evaluation ABCA4 Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The objective study investigate whether correlation genetic mutation , begin analysis ABCA4 , Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity describe phenotype Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity . STUDY POPULATION : The study enroll forty-five patient , 18 year age old , find Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity . Seventy-five volunteer systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome history Plaquenil use , without evidence retinal toxicity , also recruit . DESIGN : The study observational study 1-2 outpatient visit NEI clinic review medical record off-site participant . All participant provide blood sample genetic analysis . OUTCOME MEASURES : Clinical examination blood sample use genetic test mutation identification . The outcome study identify genetic mutation , start ABCA4 gene , associate retinal toxicity participant history Plaquenil use .</detailed_description>

Unaffected volunteer must 18 year age older : History systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) Sj ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome , History Plaquenil use , No retinal disease upon examination within last six month . 3 . All participant must able : Provide consent , Safely provide blood sample . &lt; TAB &gt; EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participants know ( genetic ) retinal disease include limited : Stargardt disease cone conerod dystrophy whose diagnosis precede Plaquenil use . Participants know previous genetic diagnosis clinical finding associate genetic diagnosis , parafoveal macular fleck associate Stargardt disease fundus flavimaculatus , also exclude .</criteria>
