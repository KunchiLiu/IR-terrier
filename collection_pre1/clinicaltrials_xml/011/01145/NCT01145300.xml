	<detailed_description>The cornerstone COPD chronic inflammation lead narrow small airway thus impairment lung function . Spirometry , frequently use pulmonary function test diagnose monitoring disease , mostly reflect obstruction large airway . The single breath N2-test , however , sensitive identify regional heterogeneity bronchial airflow obstruction small airway , main site injury COPD . The aim study evaluate whether correlation sbN2-test , marker exhale air inflammatory cell small airway . This protocol describe cross-sectional , explorative trial least 16 patient COPD ( GOLD III ) 8 patient without COPD schedule surgical resection primary lung cancer . Immunohistological method use characterize airway ( large small ) inflammation pattern macroscopically normal tissue contain small large airway collect site distant tumor . Inflammatory marker measure exhaled breath ( exhaled breath condensate , exhale NO ) correlate sbN2 test . Breath pattern lung cancer surgery assess electronic nose differential mobility spectrometry . We hypothesize sbN2-test inflammatory marker exhale breath reflect change peripheral tissue level . Therefore result present study would lead validation non-invasive tool study pathogenesis obstructive lung disease , increase knowledge relationship airway inflammation small airway obstruction , may provide support small airway specific target inhaled drug delivery .</detailed_description>
