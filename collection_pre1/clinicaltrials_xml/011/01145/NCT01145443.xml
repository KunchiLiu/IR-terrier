	<brief_summary>The care critically ill patient Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) important part modern health care system . However , ICU care suffers similar problem rest health care system . Powerful argument support concept problem complex system , ICUs , relate flaws institutional system process hind ability individual perform job well . To fix problem , defective system process must redesign way make easy people job well , hard make mistake . Altering structure ICU care purpose improve ICU performance example Organizational Systems Engineering , alternatively call Total Quality Management . Another serious problem ICU care 2007 increase shortage physician specialize care critically ill ( Intensivists ) , 35 % shortfall 2030 . One contributor shortage Intensivists retire young age physicians general , often curtail care critically ill patient even retire . It likely emotional physical demand career choice lead Intensivists `` burn '' leave field prematurely . For reason important find way make work Intensivist sustainable experience practitioner continue field normal retirement age . The way group Intensivists organize provide care ICU highly variable . One potentially important way Intensivist staff differs degree continuity care . The day row physician care patient great continuity care . While generally hold high continuity care result well care well outcomes patient , fact study address issue . On side coin however , seem likely work many day row increase physical emotional burden Intensivist , increase job distress job burnout time . A common pattern Intensivist staffing , continuity care reduce , Intensivist care ICU patient weekdays weekend , one his/her partner provide `` cross-coverage '' . While reasonable hypothesize cross-coverage would lead inefficient patient care , time may reduce burden Intensivists . This purpose study investigate effect weekend cross-coverage ICU patient Intensivists . This multicenter study perform 4 member institution Midwest Critical Care Consortium : The University Toledo , MetroHealth Medical Center , Ohio State University , Indiana University . Five adult medical ICUs six institution participate study , two ICUs Ohio State University site . To answer research question , participate ICU alternate two common model Intensivist staff . In model Intensivist responsible ICU care 14 day . In Continuous model , single Intensivist responsible 14 day . In Discontinuous model , weekend 14 day cross-covered colleague . Continuity care higher Continuous model , 2 physician transition 4 week period , Discontinuous model 8 transition per 4 week . Each participate ICU use one model 12 week , switch model 12 week , finally revert back first model final 12 week 36 week study . To address problem historical control , seasonal difference , increase comparability group , participate ICUs randomly assign begin study either Continuous Discontinuous model . Comparisons make two scheduling model : ( 1 ) patient outcome , specifically hospital mortality rate , ICU length stay , hospital length stay , ( 2 ) Intensivist outcome , specifically job distress , job burnout , balance work home life . Since currently nothing know whether weekend cross-coverage influence medical care , model care common ICUs . Thus investigator expect finding study general relevance . While patient admit participate ICUs study would expect benefit investigation , result derive expected enable policy maker make evidence-based decision important aspect ICU physician staff thus improve performance and/or cost-effectiveness ICU care , benefit future ICU patient , society .</brief_summary>
