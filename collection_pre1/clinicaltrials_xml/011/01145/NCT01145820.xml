	<detailed_description>In general antioxidant status appear influence wound heal human animal model acute trauma , low antioxidant concentration excessive oxidative stress associate impaired healing . Whilst antioxidant supplementation report improve plasma antioxidant status wound heal animal model acute trauma , remarkably little data human study . The use Juice Plus+ report increase serum concentration important antioxidant reduce serum marker oxidative stress . However , date report study concern potential Juice Plus+ improve patient-based outcome measure follow surgical removal lower third molar . This study therefore proposes investigate impact daily supplementation Juice Plus+ , improve outcome follow surgical trauma . While rationale propose study primarily predicate establish role oxidative stress antioxidant micronutrient chronic inflammatory disease , propose randomize control clinical study represent efficient way evaluate potential adjunctive Juice Plus+ use improve wound heal reduce post-operative morbidity follow surgical procedure human .</detailed_description>
