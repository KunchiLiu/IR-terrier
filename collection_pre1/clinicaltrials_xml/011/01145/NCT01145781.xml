	<brief_title>Trial Evaluate Single- Double-freeze Cryotherapy Prevention Cervical Neoplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy woman age 25 64 yr histology confirm ectocervical CIN lesion confine ectocervix without extension endocervix vagina randomize single- double-freeze cryotherapy , per inclusion criterion invite participate study . They explain study . Informed consent obtain recruit woman . The case select lesion adequately cover large cryo probe ( 2.5 cm diameter ) randomize follow arm . Arm 1 Single-freeze technique ; 3 minute freeze 5 minute thaw . Arm 2 Double-freeze technique : 3 minute freeze 5 minute thaw cycle repeat . The patient advise excessive discharge per vagina 4 week mild abdominal cramp . They advise abstain sexual intercourse 6 week . They would follow one month clinical evaluation 12th month determine cure rate Pap test , HPV Test colposcopy without biopsy . The reference investigation determine cure rate end 12 month would Pap smear , HPV Testing HC II colposcopy biopsy offer participant biopsy do woman colposcopic abnormality . Randomized trial : Stratified lesion . Randomisation analysis stratify grade CIN . Randomisation process : Each woman eligible cryotherapy present treatment , allocate randomisation number . This randomisation number 4 digit number : The first digit represent CIN stage ( 1 , 2 3 ) , 3 next digit sequential number patient ( 001 999 ) . Each sequential number randomly attribute treatment arm . The table contain information keep principal investigator know people involve treatment . The arm patient randomise known people perform follow-up visit order avoid reporting bias . As soon patient randomise double- single-freeze , box correspond sequential number line CIN column mark ' X ' . The randomisation protocol rigorously follow . Women biopsy proven ASCUS-H CIN lesion , obtain informed consent randomize single double freeze treatment case . The first follow-up one month next 12th month , patient would subject Pap test , HPV Test Hybrid Capture II colposcopy without biopsy .</detailed_description>
