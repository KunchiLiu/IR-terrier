	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Smoking secondhand smoke ( SHS ) responsible nearly half-million preventable death United States every year . Parent ( ) stop smoke incur health benefit , model non-smoking ( quit ) child stop exposure SHS home , car location . National initiative American Academy Pediatrics American Academy Family Physicians urge healthcare provider screen child history SHS exposure recommend parent stop smoking restrict smoking home , compliance guideline poor 25 % child U.S. continue involuntarily expose SHS home . Effective system need increase parental smoke cessation implement home smoking restriction . We propose preliminary study evaluate novel intervention accomplish objective . We hypothesize clinic system routinely measure report level tobacco toxicant ( tobacco-specific carcinogen , nicotine cotinine ) find urine child expose SHS 1 ) increase provider delivery tobacco treatment , 2 ) increase parental participation tobacco treatment , 3 ) increase parental smoke cessation 4 ) reduce childhood exposure secondhand smoke . We propose formative work among healthcare provider parent develop intervention pilot test effect intervention provider parent . We conduct focus group among staff identify training need , develop method integrate intervention office practice ass barrier implementation . We also conduct focus group among parent assess willingness provide urine specimen , optimal feedback format reaction biomarker data . Results focus group use develop experimental treatment protocol . We test intervention two-group randomize pilot study University Minnesota Primary Care Clinic . We recruit 80 child age 0-12 parent smoke . We provide brief behavioral counseling healthy lifestyle option parent . One provider team implement experimental intervention 40 parent-child pair team serve control . Children see provider experimental group provide urine sample test nitrosamines ( tobacco-specific carcinogen ) , nicotine cotinine . We communicate laboratory result provider use electronic medical record incorporate result parental tobacco counseling design promote smoke cessation home smoking restriction . The primary outcome provider delivery smoking cessation treatment . We also measure effect parental engagement treatment , smoke cessation institution home smoking restriction experimental control group . The research team bring extensive experience novel tobacco intervention , health service research biomarker assessment project . Routine documentation tobacco toxicants child 's urine potential dramatically alter clinical care family risk smoking .</detailed_description>
