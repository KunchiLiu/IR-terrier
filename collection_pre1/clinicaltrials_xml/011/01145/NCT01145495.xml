	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Rituximab Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Follicular Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( overall complete ) lenalidomide + rituximab follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) patient receive prior systemic therapy . II . To determine time progression lenalidomide + rituximab previously untreated patient cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20+ follicular NHL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile lenalidomide + rituximab therapy previously untreated patient CD20+ follicular NHL . II . To establish whether therapeutic effect lenalidomide + rituximab combination sufficiently promise warrant evaluation subsequent randomize trial ( comparison rituximab alone ) . III . To correlate fragment crystallizable gamma ( Fcg ) receptor polymorphism profile response lenalidomide + rituximab previously untreated patient follicular NHL . IV . To determine impact lenalidomide immune parameter patient previously untreated follicular lymphoma . V. To determine impact lenalidomide angiogenic parameter patient previously untreated follicular lymphoma . VI . To correlate lymphoma-associated macrophage ( LAM ) forkhead box P3 ( FOXP3 ) , granzyme B ( GzB ) , CD10 , multiple myeloma oncogene 1 ( MUM1 ) , B-cell lymphoma 2 ( BCL2 ) expression response rituximab + lenalidomide previously untreated patient follicular lymphoma . VII . Determine whether immune gene signatures previously identify prognostic factor follicular lymphoma ( FL ) apply paraffin-embedded tissue rituximab treated patient ; evaluate micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) signatures associate gene signatures outcome ; validate immunohistochemical marker associate outcome FL ( CD68 LAMs , FOXP3 , CD10 , BCL6 , FOXP1 , MUM1 ) ; investigate whether marker angiogenesis may value prognosis FL . OUTLINE : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment lenalidomide repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 week 13 , 21 , 29 , 37 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 2 year every 6 month 8 year .</detailed_description>
