	<brief_summary>Background : - Ofatumumab approve U.S. Food Drug Administration treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) respond standard chemotherapy . Ofatumumab substance recognize specific type white blood cell call B-lymphocytes , become cancerous CLL/SLL . Ofatumumab attach molecule call CD20 , find surface B-cells , destroy . Previous study show ofatumumab decrease number B-cells patient CLL/SLL treat chemotherapy , research need determine also use treat patient previously untreated CLL/SLL . Objectives : - To determine safe effective dose ofatumumab , along chemotherapy , treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose CLL SLL treat chemotherapy . Design : - Eligible participant screen physical examination , blood sample , lymph node bone marrow biopsy , image study . - Participants separate two group : participant receive ofatumumab fludarabine , participant select also receive cyclophosphamide ( base result certain blood test ) . - Participants receive study drug ( ofatumumab fludarabine , optional cyclophosphamide ) infusion maximum 6 day , follow 21 day drug . - Participants six cycle treatment accord schedule set study doctor , may dose level adjust side effect develop . - Participants disease remain six cycle receive additional ofatumumab every 2 month , start 2 month end sixth cycle continue total four dos , enter follow-up phase trial . Participants residual disease six cycle receive additional therapy , immediately enter follow-up phase trial . - Participants follow-up exam every 2 4 month 2 year end treatment , require study doctor long study remain open . These visit involve full medical examination , blood sample , lymph node bone marrow biopsy , image study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Ofatumumab-Based Induction Chemoimmunotheraphy Followed Consolidation Ofatumumab Immunotherapy Previously Untreated Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : Patients adverse interphase cytogenetics ( 11q22 17p13 deletion ) receive FCO induction therapy : - Ofatumumab give IV day 1 ( 300 mg ) day 8 ( 1000 mg ) course 1 day 1 ( 1000 mg ) subsequent course . - Fludarabine phosphate ( 25mg/m2/d ) cyclophosphamide ( 250mg/m2/d ) give IV day 2 4 course 1 day 1 3 subsequent course . Patients age 70 old give reduce &lt; TAB &gt; dose fludarabine ( 20mg/m2/d ) cyclophosphamide ( 150mg/m2/d ) . - Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression . Patients without adverse interphase cytogenetics receive FO induction therapy : - Ofatumumab give IV day 1 ( 300mg ) day 8 ( 1000mg ) course 1 day 1 ( 1000mg ) subsequent course . - Fludarabine phosphate ( 25mg/m2/d ) give IV day 2 6 course 1 day 1 5 subsequent course . - Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression . All patient evaluate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) four-color flow cytometric analysis peripheral blood completion FO FCO induction therapy , subsequently stratify two group : - Patients MRD-positive without evidence disease progression proceed consolidation &lt; TAB &gt; therapy begin approximately 5 month completion induction therapy , consist ofatumumab ( 1000mg ) give IV day 1 course . Treatment repeat every 2 month 4 course absence disease progression . Patients follow clinically 2 6 month last dose ofatumumab give , every 6 month thereafter . - Patients MRD-negative without evidence disease progression follow clinically every 4 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
