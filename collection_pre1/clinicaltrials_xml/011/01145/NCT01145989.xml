Patients must receive prior treatment multiple myeloma relapse progressed prior therapy . There limit number prior treatment regimen , patient must complete prior treatment least 4 week prior registration ( &lt; 4 week permit prior therapy nonmyelosuppressive treatmentrelated myelosuppression resolve . Please call NCIC CTG discussion ) . Patient must recover treatment related adverse event . In patient significant cardiac history prior anthracycline exposure , Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) must ≥ 50 % . Prior radiation permit , must complete least 4 week prior registration . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Laboratory Requirements : ( must within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology : Absolute granulocyte ( AGC ) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 70 x 109/L Hemoglobin &gt; 100 g/L Biochemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Bilirubin normal AST ALT ≤ 2 x upper normal limit Calcium normal In patient significant cardiac history prior anthrecycline exposure , leftventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) must ≥ 50 % Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre .
