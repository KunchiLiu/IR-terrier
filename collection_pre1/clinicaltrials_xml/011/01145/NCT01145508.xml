	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well docetaxel prednisone without vaccine therapy work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer spread part body . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Vaccines make antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether docetaxel prednisone effective without vaccine therapy treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Prednisone With Without Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival patient treat PSA-TRICOM ( fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine rilimogene-galvacirepvec ) docetaxel chemotherapy versus docetaxel chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate time radiographic progression begin docetaxel chemotherapy patient previously treat PSA-TRICOM vaccine versus treat vaccine . II . To compare objective response ( accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] ) two treatment group patient measurable disease . III . To evaluate prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate ( decline &gt; = 50 % ) patient treat PSA-TRICOM docetaxel chemotherapy versus docetaxel chemotherapy . IV . To evaluate immune response elicit patient treat docetaxel chemotherapy . V. To evaluate association development prostate antigen-specific immune response time progression overall survival . VI . To evaluate association predict survival ( Halabi nomogram ) actual survival patient treat PSA-TRICOM vaccine versus treat vaccine . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A ( vaccine chemotherapy ) : Patients receive rilimogene-galvacirepvec subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 course 1 fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine SC day 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 course 1 . Beginning day 85 ( day 1 course 2 ) , patient receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Treatment docetaxel prednisone repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B ( chemotherapy ) : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 prednisone PO BID day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
