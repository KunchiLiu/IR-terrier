	<detailed_description>Background . Influenza infection cause estimate 1 million death worldwide yearly . Severe influenza respiratory disease increasingly recognize child . Influenza hospitalization rate high-risk infant , premature infant , increase five-fold rate child . Influenza vaccine immunogenicity generally modest even healthy child , influenza vaccine incompletely studied premature infant . The recently-licensed live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) immunogenic trivalent inactivate vaccine , use infant high risk child limit side effect . The risk/benefit ratio LAIV extremely premature infant , may increase risk influenza disease vaccine side effect , unknown . Aim . The specific aim project compare immunogenicity reactogenicity trivalent , inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) live , attenuate , intranasal influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) group former premature ( PT ) , low birth weight ( VLBW ) former full-term ( FT ) infant age 24-35 month . Hypotheses . 1 . The humoral immunogenicity LAIV , measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) , great TIV . This co-primary outcome study . 2 . Vaccine reactogenicity , measure medically-attended wheezing episode , twice frequent LAIV TIV recipient . This co-primary outcome study . 3 . Functional B-cell response , measure antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) enzyme link immunospot ( ELISPOT ) , great LAIV-immunized infant TIV-immunized infant . 4 . Peak T-cell cytokine response , measure interferon gamma ( IFNÎ³ ) , interleukin ( IL ) -2 IL-4 ELISPOT , great LAIV-immunized infant TIV-immunized infant . 5 . Hemagglutinin-specific nasal immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) measureable follow LAIV immunization . 6 . Former premature infant similar adaptive immune response , elevate reactogenicity vaccine , compare former full-term infant . Design . The study enroll 14 former premature , VLBW infants 14 former full-term infant . Subjects , eligible receive either TIV LAIV part routine care , randomize receive one dose either TIV LAIV , accord prevail recommendation influenza immunization . Randomization stratify prematurity status . Vaccine reactogenicity measure use parent diary follow immunization questionnaire visit . Five 10 mL blood drawn 0 7-14 day immunization isolation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , 1 mL blood drawn serum separation antibody determination 0 28-42 day . Antibody level T- B-cell response vaccine measure . Potential Impact . This study design assess immunogenicity reactogenicity two current influenza vaccine premature infant . The data use estimate sample size definitive trial young premature infant .</detailed_description>
