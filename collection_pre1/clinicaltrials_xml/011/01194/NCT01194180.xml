	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate BCG 'challenge ' model four-arm study design choose . Twelve subject recruit arm study . Allocation BCG-naïve volunteer either group A B , BCG-vaccinated volunteer either group C D , perform one-to-one alternating basis . Subjects group challenge BCG administer intradermally . Prior challenge , pre-existing immunity TB induce vaccination BCG , MVA85A , combination ( compare BCG- &amp; MVA85A-naïve individual ) . BCG quantification assess analyse tissue obtain punch biopsy volunteer ' skin site BCG 'challenge ' vaccination . Any reduction BCG quantification group correlate exist ( future ) laboratory assay vaccine-induced immune response order identify potential immunological correlate protection .</brief_summary>
