	<brief_summary>Patients ask take part study metastatic breast cancer triple negative ( express estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) HER2 ) . This mean agent trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) tamoxifen currently treatment option cancer . Another option treat patient 's cancer point chemotherapy . The patient discus option doctor prior enter study . Laboratory study demonstrate ER actually present triple negative breast cancer `` silence '' ( function properly ) methyl histone group attach inactivate . Special drug call demethylating inhibitor ( decitabine ) histone deacetylase inhibitor ( LBH589 ) remove methyl histone group reactivate ER . This reactivate ER target agent like tamoxifen . The patient ask join clinical research study find ER reactivate cancer use decitabine combination LBH589 . If ER reactivate cancer , determine tamoxifen decrease growth cancer .</brief_summary>
