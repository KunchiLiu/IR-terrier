	<brief_summary>Background : - Bacteria micro-organisms intestine play important role immunity health condition . As result , micro-organisms likely affect many health condition , include several type cancer . Because cancer disease may affect digestive system bacteria within , fecal sample take onset disease may show important change body provide information possible treatment . However , unlike repository blood tissue sample , researcher repository fecal specimen . Researchers interested determine whether standard collection procedure use fecal occult blood test provide accurate information micro-organisms intestine . Objectives : - To determine whether standard fecal occult blood test procedure provide accurate collection fecal micro-organisms research purpose . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - At clinical center , participant provide write illustrated instruction collection procedures self-administered risk questionnaire . The questionnaire ass challenge collect fecal specimen collect data major dietary restriction ( e.g. , vegan , vegetarian , food allergy ) , medication use major illness , knowledge past experience fecal occult blood testing , colonoscopy colon cancer , fecal collection device . - Participants provide collection bag sample , 16 sample collection tube , box frozen gel pack . - On morning collection , participant collect fecal sample bag use collection tube obtain material different part stool . - The tube seal place box gel pack , participant hand deliver entire box clinical center . - Characteristics bacteria material measure laboratory University Maryland . - Statistical comparison determine well procedure work .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Commensal bacteria microbial organism ( microbiota ) , particularly intestine , centrally related nutrition , metabolism , immunity , inflammation , endocrine balance . As initial step toward possible establishment biobank feces could use prospective study relationship microbiota cancer condition , propose study evaluate whether fecal microbiota , well microbial enzyme expression function , reproducibly represent feces collect device widely use fecal occult blood test ( FOBT-CHEK oc ) . To , study recruit convenience sample 50 volunteer DCEG others NIH . From single stool , participant provide 16 aliquot feces , half collect FOBT-CHEK oc rest large Sarstedt device . A urine sample brief self-administered questionnaire antibiotic medication , serious chronic disease , major cancer risk factor also obtain . The aliquot use microbiome pyrosequencing , beta-glucuronidase beta-glucosidase expression enzymatic activity . Variance within collection device , well individual , quantify . This study provide insight quantitative estimate require formal study relationship fecal microbiome cancer . Under amendment , examine ability select antibiotic stabilize fecal microbial population store 3 7 day prior freeze , 10 volunteer participant ask provide aliquot second stool specimen . Differences immediate delay freeze without antibiotic test analysis variance . Under amendment , 100 participant enrol examine reproducibility microbiota use commercial colorectal cancer screen device stability microbiota within individual four year , participant ask collect specimen 2014 , exactly do 2010 . Assays anlyses analogous perform previously .</detailed_description>
