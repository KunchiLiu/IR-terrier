It common belief large meal provoke considerable postprandial reflux result increase rate transient low esophageal sphincter relaxation . One study also reveal rapid food intake produce gastroesophageal reflux healthy volunteer . So study attempted evaluate relationship dietary habit GEFV abnormality . The investigator use questionnaire regard dietary habit population undergo EGD self-paid health examination .</brief_summary>
