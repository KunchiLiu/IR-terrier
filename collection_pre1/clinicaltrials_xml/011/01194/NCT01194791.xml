	<brief_title>Lendexal Patients With Primary Systemic Amyloidosis ( AL ) Newly Diagnosed</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It multicenter , single arm treatment , phase II study combination one treatment arm Lenalidomide , Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone . Subjects qualify participation receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone cyclophosphamide 4-week cycle . Subjects see ( study visit ) every 2 week first 3 cycle therapy monthly thereafter . Cycles lenalidomide/dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide consist lenalidomide 15 mg mouth 21 day follow 7 day rest 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide day 1 8 plus oral dexamethasone 20 mg/day day 1-4 9-12 give 4-week interval . Patients treat 6 cycle therapy option continue beyond long evidence response . In case dose lenalidomide dose dexamethasone administer day 1 4 cycle dose cyclophosphamide day 1 6 cycle . After 12 cycle patient remain response , treat 10 mg/day , cyclophosphamide day 1 , dexamethasone administer day 1 4 cycle . For first 3 cycle , patient follow adverse event hematologic control every 2 week monthly thereafter . Patients require blood work-up include total serum protein serum protein electrophoresis , urine protein study clinical visit cycle . Organ involvement assess every 4 cycle first year therapy . Hematologic response assess every 3 month organ response every 6 month first year treatment . Treatment modification base adverse event grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE Version 3.0 ) . There 30 patient enrol . The trial consist three period : pre-treatment , treatment follow period . Pre-treatment phase : include enrolment visit order determine patient eligible participate study . The patient sign Informed Consent Form take part study , receive detailed information treatment , benefit risk . Treatment phase : include 12 cycle 28 day treatment Lenalidomide , Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone induction therapy follow low dos Lenalidomide Dexamethasone three year progression unacceptable toxicity level . Follow phase : Once clinical trial finish , patient follow usual clinical practice visit progression , free survival overall survival evaluate .</detailed_description>
