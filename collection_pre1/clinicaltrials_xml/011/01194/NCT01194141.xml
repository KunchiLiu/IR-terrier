	<brief_summary>Barth syndrome ( BTHS ) genetic disease result heart failure , muscle weakness exercise intolerance . Several study non-BTHS heart failure suggest endurance exercise train beneficial improving exercise intolerance , heart function quality life young men BTHS . This study examine effect Endurance ( i.e . aerobic ) exercise training exercise tolerance , heart function , quality life adolescent young adult BTHS . We hypothesize 3 month endurance train improve exercise tolerance , heart function quality life adolescent young men BTHS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Barth Syndrome ( BTHS ) X-linked disorder characterize severe mitochondrial dysfunction , skeletal cardiomyopathy growth retardation . The investigator recently find severe exercise intolerance adolescent BTHS mediate impaired skeletal muscle oxygen extraction utilization . Previous evidence mitochondrial pathology demonstrate chronic aerobic exercise training enhance mitochondrial biogenesis , improve skeletal muscle oxygen extraction/utilization , exercise tolerance quality life individual . Chronic aerobic exercise training also improve leave ventricular cardio-autonomic function decrease occurrence arrhythmia non-Barth heart failure arrhythmia human animal model . Currently unknown chronic aerobic exercise training effective improving leave ventricular function , skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis oxygen extraction/utilization , exercise tolerance , cardio-autonomic function quality life BTHS ; condition contain characteristic consistent mitochondrial myopathy heart failure . Establishing safety efficacy aerobic exercise training BTHS could lead clinical recommendation regular exercise training standard care treatment individual BTHS . It may also provide novel mechanistic information adaptability muscle mitochondrion BTHS . Therefore , overall objective pilot/feasibility/proof-of-concept proposal collect preliminary data follow hypothesis : Supervised aerobic exercise training ( 3x/wk , 20-45 min , 12 wks ) improve skeletal muscle oxygen extraction/utilization , leave ventricular function , peak exercise tolerance , cardio-autonomic function quality life , find safe adolescent young adult BTHS . The investigator aim address hypothesis leave ventricular function , skeletal muscle oxygen extraction/utilization , whole body oxygen consumption measurement grade exercise test baseline follow 3 month supervise aerobic exercise training program 5 BTHS patient ( age 15-30 yr ) . Cardio-autonomic function examine use post-exercise heart rate recovery measurement obtain baseline 12 wk intervention . Supervised exercise training program uniformly design , individualize perform hospital base physical therapy cardiac rehabilitation facility near participant 's home . Left ventricular function examine use 2-D , Doppler Tissue Doppler echocardiography , skeletal muscle oxygen extraction/utilization measure use near infrared spectroscopy , whole body oxygen consumption measure use indirect calorimetry , cardio-autonomic function measure use electrocardiography quality life measure Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire ( MLWHFQ ) . The investigator expect find exercise training safe BTHS , effectively improve cardiac skeletal muscle function quality life . Preliminary data proposal use large federal association grant application examine cardiovascular , musculo-skeletal autonomic effect chronic aerobic exercise training BTHS .</detailed_description>
