	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue patient liver cancer . Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy may also increase patient eligibility liver transplant.PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well stereotactic body radiation therapy work treat patient liver cancer remove surgery transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Liver Cancer That Can Removed Surgery Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient stage B C Hepatocellular Carcinoma , Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy achieve downstaging rate &gt; = 30 % 3 months.SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient stage B C Hepatocellular Carcinoma , Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy achieve downstaging rate &gt; = 30 % 3 6 months.II . To determine rate Grade 3 4 adverse event associate SBRT liver tumor . III . To determine rate local progression SBRT . ( Based onRECIST criterion ) IV . To determine number patient achieve liver transplantation.OUTLINE : Patients undergo 3 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy deliver within 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
