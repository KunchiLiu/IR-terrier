	<brief_summary>Natera recruiting patient research study evaluate pregnancy implantation rate woman undergo In Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) Preimplantation Genetic Screening ( PGS ) . PGS also refer Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis ( PGD ) aneuploidy . Healthy woman undergo IVF age 35 42 year recruit participate randomize study . The purpose study determine whether PGS- test embryos create IVF chromosomal abnormality , prior transfer uterus- improves pregnancy implantation rate patient compare patient whose embryos test . PGS conduct use 24 Chromosome Aneuploidy Screening Parental Support Natera . All subject qualify enroll receive discount IVF medication ( TEST CONTROL arm ) . If become pregnant study , receive small payment provide information pregnancy birth . If assign TEST arm study receive free PGS .</brief_summary>
