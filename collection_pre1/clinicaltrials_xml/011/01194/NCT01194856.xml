	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate switch antiretroviral medication efavirenz ( EFV ) atazanavir/ ritonavir ( ARV/r ) , 96-week period , change : 1. amount fat HIV patient lipoatrophy , 2. metabolic lab value lipid ( fat ) profile , glucose ( blood sugar ) , insulin ( hormone regulate glucose ) HIV patient lipoatrophy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switching From Efavirenz Atazanavir/ Ritonavir HIV-infected Subjects With Good Virologic Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study evaluate effect peripheral fat switch EFV ATV/r 96 week HIV+ patient clinical lipoatrophy . From virologic standpoint , EFV ATV/r medication recommend equally preferred component antiretroviral regimen December 2009 version Guidelines Use Antiretroviral Agents HIV-1 Infected Adults Adolescents . [ 20 ] The study subject receive stable EFV-containing antiretroviral ( ART ) regimen least 48 week prior study entry . Blood save investigation need . Safety parameter regularly assess throughout study . In addition , subcutaneous fat biopsy obtain measure fat mtDNA , mtRNA , fat apoptosis . These measurement would provide significant insight clinical change recently describe .</detailed_description>
