	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous research show certain part brain involve voluntarily stop ongoing motor response ( movement ) ; however , know whether network also involve suppress urge act . Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) significantly impair brain 's ability voluntarily stop inhibit certain action . Using brain imaging ( functional magnetic resonance imaging , fMRI ) brain stimulation ( transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ) investigate people perform activity involve move suppress movement , researcher hope good understand brain area might affect people TBI . Objectives : - To determine part brain involve suppress urge act . - To determine extent traumatic brain injury affect certain part brain involve problem suppress urge move stop movement . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 40 year age mild moderate TBI , healthy volunteer . Design : - This research study include screen visit two study visit , last least 2 hour . - Participants screen physical examination medical history . Women become pregnant urine pregnancy test allow participate study . - At first study visit , participant complete one follow experiment test MRI scanner . - Experiment 1 : Participants show arrow image computer screen , press button press button depend image show . Participants practice experiment task perform MRI scan . - Experiment 2 : Participants show arrow image computer screen , press button press button depend image show . Participants also TMS rest , perform experiment task MRI scan . - At second study visit , participant fMRI scan ask simple response task computer outside MRI scanner .

	<detailed_description>Objectives Voluntarily stop on-going motor response show engage specific prefrontal-basal-ganglia ( PBG ) neural network . However , know whether PBG network also crucial type response inhibition suppress urge act ( i.e. , habitual impulse ) , common impairment traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The objective protocol : 1 ) determine whether PBG network engage suppress habitual impulse , 2 ) determine extent ( PBG ) neural network account deficiency response inhibition mild moderate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . The proposed study involve performance simple behavioral task , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . tDCS apply separately fMRI scan . TMS apply separately concurrently fMRI scan . Study Population One hundred ninety healthy adult volunteer 95 patient mild moderate TBI recruit protocol . Eighty healthy volunteer 80 patient recruit project fund Center Neuroscience Rehabilitative Medicine ( CNRM ) Uniformed Services University Health Sciences ( USUHS ) . Design There five experiment . Experiment 1 include healthy adult volunteer mild moderate TBI patient determine whether PBG inhibitory network engage suppression undesirable habitual impulse . Subjects perform simple motor response task fMRI scan . Experiment 2 use fMRI behavioral task apply single-pulse TMS fMRI scan subject rest examine whether change active rest neural connectivity within PBG network associate deficiency response inhibition mild moderate TBI . Experiment 3 involve healthy volunteer determine effect disruption critical links/brain region within PBG network response inhibition . Inhibitory rTMS ( i.e. , 1Hz repetitive TMS stimulation intensity 80 % subject rest motor threshold [ rMT ] ) apply separate group subject immediately behavioral task . Experiments 4-5 use similar response task Experiment 1 patient blast induced concussion ( ) . tDCS apply Experiment 5 examine extent tDCS may change connectivity improve rapid response inhibition . Additional behavioral measure , DTI , high-resolution structural MRI image acquire separate session subject . Outcome Measures Major outcome measure include : 1 ) Task TMS induce fMRI BOLD signal change , 2 ) Behavioral performance data ( reaction time accuracy ) . Secondary measure : White matter fiber integrity fiber track base diffusion tensor image data .</detailed_description>
