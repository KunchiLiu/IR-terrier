	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) , common inherit disease Caucasians , characterize chronic pulmonary inflammation progressive loss gas exchange unit eventually result respiratory failure . There strong evidence , CF , abnormally low perfusion carry high risk death independent presence pulmonary hypertension . However , evolution pulmonary vascular disease CF might contribute rate decline lung function know . Our knowledge remain limited result old observational study conclude major cause pulmonary vascular remodel hypertension CF hypoxic respiratory failure destruction lung tissue . Our recent data obtain state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) pulmonary circulation , challenge exist paradigm . We demonstrate absence hypoxia , significant change pulmonary perfusion surrogate measure vascular resistance well collateral blood flow begin early course CF . Newly develop therapeutic alter dramatically course patient suffer pulmonary vascular disease . Through 8 week trial , examine Magnetic Resonance Imaging effect Sildenafil pulmonary perfusion systemic vascularization lung subject mild moderate disease .</brief_summary>
