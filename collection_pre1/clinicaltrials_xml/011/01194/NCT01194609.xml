	<detailed_description>Immune cell therapy consider one promise anti-cancer strategy many human cancer . Compared destructive method surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , anti-cancer immune therapy safer less toxic method treatment human cancer patient . Among immune cell therapy , autologous adoptive immune cell therapy method transfer immune cell derive peripheral white blood cell expand stimulate various cytokine tumor specific antigens cancer patient . Recent development technique expand immune cell ex vivo make autologous adoptive immune cell therapy much feasible popular . However , immune cell therapy show response 10 % currently several clinical trial . The reason poor response adopt immune cell overcome highly immune compromise environment advanced recurrent cancer patient . The low-dose radiation , define radiation therapeutic dose range , know increase immune response many human cancer patient . Despite exact mechanism well know , 'danger signal ' decrease T-regulatory cell low-dose radiation possible mechanism enhance immunity low-dose radiation . So , combination low-dose radiation immune cell therapy attractive strategy recurrent advance cancer patient resistant conventional treatment . A challenging clinical trial perform recurrent melanoma cancer , Dr. Rosenverg report around 70 % response rate combination low-dose radiation adoptive immune cell therapy . However , feasibility combination low-dose radiation immune cell therapy still unknown many human cancer . This study investigate feasibility combination low-dose radiation autologous immune cell therapy recurrent cervical cancer resistant conventional palliative treatment . The cervical cancer , highly responsive radiation , become resistant radiation case recurrent disease . We hypothetize low-dose radiation reverse immune compromise environment , adoptive immune cell derive autologous peripheral blood immune cell highly effective recurrent cervical cancer .</detailed_description>
