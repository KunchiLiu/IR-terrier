	<brief_title>Microplasmin Intravitreal Administration Participants With Uveitic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Uveitis , inflammatory condition affect uvea ( iris , ciliary body choroid ) adjacent structure eye , important cause visual loss . Most case uveitis , relate infectious agent , think autoimmune origin effectively treat medication suppress function immune system . Efforts decrease morbidity , reduce dose toxic immunosuppressive drug , reduce frequency recurrence inflammation sequela important goal treatment uveitis . A frequent sequela uveitis macular edema . Treatment macular edema patient uveitis particular challenge . Current evidence diabetic macular edema ( DME ) vitreomacular traction ( VMT ) trial suggest pharmacologically-induced vitreoretinal separation could potential treatment macular edema associate uveitis . Microplasmin , truncate form human plasmin naturally occur enzyme dissolve blood clot , may reasonable candidate treatment uveitic macular edema . The objective study investigate safety efficacy microplasmin treatment uveitic macular edema . Study Population : Five participant uveitic macular edema , without VMT , enrol . In addition , participant must evidence macular complete posterior vitreous detachment ( PVD ) Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) ultrasound . Design : This Phase I-II , non-randomized , prospective , uncontrolled , single-center study involve one-time intravitreal injection 125 µg 100 µL microplasmin . Eligible participant receive intravitreal injection day baseline examination . Participants follow 24 week post-injection . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure relate safety tolerability microplasmin assess number severity adverse event ( AEs ) systemic ocular toxicity study . The secondary outcome measure relate potential efficacy intravitreal injection microplasmin macular edema secondary uveitis assess change central macular thickness baseline measure OCT response microplasmin 4 12 week post-injection , number participant achieve macular complete PVD 4 12 week post-injection , change ETDRS best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) change retino-vascular leakage baseline see fluorescein angiography ( FA ) .</detailed_description>
