	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , double-blind study enroll nonsmoking female subject undergo laparoscopic bariatric surgery general anesthesia . The hypothesis study female nonsmoker receive nicotine via nasal spray immediately wake anesthesia need less pain medication 24 hour surgery compare subject receive placebo spray .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nicotine Administration Post-operative Opioid Use With Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Though nicotine know mild analgesic , use peri-operative period reduce postoperative opioid requirement recently investigate . In nonsmoker show reduce postoperative pain opioid requirement female patient undergo uterine surgery male patient undergoing prostatectomy . We recently confirm finding woman undergo uterine surgery open , laparoscopic vaginal approach . In study find 30 % mean reduction 24 hour postoperative opioid requirement follow administration 3 mg dose nicotine nasal spray . Two previous study perioperative transdermal nicotine find increase dos nicotine increase serum level nicotine associate high rate nausea . In study , find administration nasal nicotine associate transient increase postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) , limited recovery room ( PACU ) stay . Two study nasal nicotine antiemetic prophylactically administer report incidence nausea . In study , antiemetic use rescue medication . Thus , unclear prophylactic administration anti-emetics would effectively counteract transient emetogenic effect small dose nasal nicotine . Laparoscopic bariatric surgery become increasingly popular treatment morbid obesity . We recently perform detailed analysis postoperative pain opioid requirement among patient type surgery find among non-smokers severe pain ( pain &gt; 7/10 10 point scale ) commonly experience ( 35 % ) despite substantial amount postoperative opioid use ( mean 68 mg oral morphine equivalent ) non-opioid analgesic first 24 hour . Because obesity relate sleep disorder exceed 70 % patient undergo bariatric surgery , disorder exacerbate opioids , potential therapy could reduce postoperative opioid requirement patient substantial value . Further , delay nausea often pose problem patient meet hospital discharge criterion , opioids use analgesia aggravates problem . Thus , use nasal nicotine could reduce amount opioid patient require postoperative analgesia . Combined aggressive antiemetic prophylaxis PONV , nasal nicotine could paradoxically indirectly reduce incidence nausea patient decrease postoperative opioid requirement . The propose study randomize clinical trial examine nicotine affect recovery female non-smokers undergo bariatric surgery general anesthesia . We test hypothesis nicotine , administer nasal spray immediately emergence anesthesia , reduce postoperative opioid requirement postoperative pain . A secondary outcome ass routine administration prophylactic antiemetic therapy prevents increase PONV associate nicotine administration .</detailed_description>
