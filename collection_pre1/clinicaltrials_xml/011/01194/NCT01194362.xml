	<brief_title>A Study Identify Differences Gene Expression Patients With Bicuspid Tricuspid Valve Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The cause bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV ) associate co morbidity unknown . There , however , evidence support genetic cause BAV , Pedigree analysis familial cluster initially direct investigator genetic cause BAV . Subsequent study BAV patient use linkage analysis demonstrate high heritability . Early identification patient BAV disease risk ascend aneurysm formation complication may allow early intervention prevent rupture , dissection emergent cardiac surgery risk patient . Conversely , identification patient BAVs risk aortic aneurysm formation would delineate patient need close follow aortic size prophylactic ascend aortic replacement time aortic valve replacement .</detailed_description>
