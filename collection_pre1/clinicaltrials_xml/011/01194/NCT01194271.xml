	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn ipilimumab combination Lupron ( leuprolide acetate ) affect body 's defense ( immune ) system surgery remove prostate cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neoadjuvant Ipilimumab Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Ipilimumab design cause immune response body block 2 specific molecule usually block immune response . This may help kill cancer cell . Leuprolide acetate design low level testosterone ( male hormone ) blood . This may slow growth cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive leuprolide acetate injection muscle . This consider Week 0 . One week later , begin treatment ipilimumab . Ipilimumab give vein 90 minute Weeks 1 4 ( 21 day apart ) . During infusion , blood pressure measure every 30 minute , hour finish receive drug . Study Visits : At Weeks 0 , 1 , 4 7 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect may experience . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 7-10 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This blood also test measure protein , PSA testosterone level , check function thyroid adrenal gland , test immune response . Surgery : About 4 week second treatment ipilimumab , surgery remove prostate gland . You ask sign separate consent form describe surgery risk . A sample leftover prostate gland tissue surgery test immune response . On day , follow test procedure perform : Between 14 24 week surgery , return clinic post-operative follow-up visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect experience since last visit . - Blood ( 7-10 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This blood also use measure protein , testosterone PSA level , check function thyroid adrenal gland , test immune response . - You bone scan , either CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Length Study : You receive 2 treatment ipilimumab study . You study 24 week surgery . You take study intolerable side effect occur , disease get bad , study doctor think best interest take study . This investigational study . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available . Ipilimumab currently use research purpose . Leuprolide acetate FDA approve management metastatic prostate cancer approve use definitive surgery . It commercially available treat prostate cancer . Up 20 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
