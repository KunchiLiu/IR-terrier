Although efficacious intervention develop otherwise typically develop youth anxiety disorder , linguistic ; cognitive ; social characteristic ASD may render standard treatment approach less effective child ASD ( Volkmar &amp; Klin , 2000 ) . Thus , clinical need modification exist treatment modality unique group . To date , study experimentally test efficacy CBT youth comorbid presentation anxiety ASD . This gap literature particular concern give prevalence comorbid anxiety among child , consequence untreated anxiety , unknown efficacy antidepressant medication anxiety ASD , potential safety tolerability issue relate medication use . Accordingly , propose randomize controlled trial examine efficacy CBT relative treatment usual ( TAU ) 46 youth age 7-11 ASD comorbid anxiety disorder ( ) . In proposed grant , : ( 1 ) examine acute efficacy CBT relative TAU , ( 2 ) evaluate short-term maintenance treatment gain . Forty-six child ( age 7-11 year ) ASD comorbid anxiety disorder ( ) randomly assign one two treatment condition . Primary outcome assess independent evaluator , include change anxiety symptom severity ; response rate ; remission rate . Considering rise number child diagnose ASD , propose work toward advent efficacious CBT protocol provide timely contribution public health effort .</detailed_description>
