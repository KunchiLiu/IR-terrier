	<brief_summary>It well know statin use low cholesterol prevent treat coronary artery disease many year . It also report statin could protect endothelial function cardiac function coronary artery bypass graft . However , result controversial . Also , clinical data available statin cardiac protection surgery China rheumatic heart disease prevalent . Thus , investigator try see whether statin protect heart injury cardiac surgery Chinese . Part patient receive statin treatment part surgery study . Both patient ' heart function measure compare surgery determine whether statin protect heart injury heart surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Simvastatin Cardiac Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac function crucial cardiac surgery . The mortality remain high patient poor cardiac function preoperation , long surgical time , complicate difficult surgical procedure uncompleted corrected malformation currently . Thus , necessary search approach improve cardiac function cardiac surgery patient order increase success , decrease complication mortality cardiac surgery . Although statin use low cholesterol prevent treat coronary artery disease many year , report statin could protect endothelial function cardiac function coronary artery bypass graft . However , result controversy . Also , clinical data available statin cardiac protection surgery China rheumatic heart disease prevalence.Thus , necessary perform double blind , randomise clinical trial China determine whether statin protect heart injury heart surgery China 's mechanism .</detailed_description>
