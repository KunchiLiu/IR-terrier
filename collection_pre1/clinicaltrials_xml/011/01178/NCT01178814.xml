	<brief_summary>This prospective trial Revlimid subject blood cell cancer call myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . Cells marrow make protein message carry gene . The amount message tell researcher protein go make high low . This known expression gene . The purpose study conduct prospective trial test idea expression specific gene help predict patient respond study drug administration Revlimid ( lenalidomide ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Revlimid Transfusion Dependent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first Revlimid® study report List et al include transfusion dependent MDS patient , give early experience show good response del ( 5q ) patient low risk disease , patient belong category enter trial . The subsequent multi-center study focus entirely low/Int-1 patient transfusion dependent . In present study , would like recapitulate initial study treat transfusion dependent , low intermediate-1 risk MDS patient without deletion ( 5q ) . Since predictive assay applicable non-del ( 5q ) patient , avoid confusion result admixture patient del ( 5q ) drug already FDA approve , elect restrict clinical trial non-del ( 5q ) patient . In present study , non-del ( 5q ) transfusion dependent , low intermediate-1 risk MDS patient treat single agent Revlimid® . All patient pre-therapy bone marrow study gene expression microarray , Luminex bead assay , real-time PCR .</detailed_description>
