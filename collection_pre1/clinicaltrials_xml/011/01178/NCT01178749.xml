	<brief_title>Exploration Chronic Hepatitis C Infection Receiving 24-week Interferon-α With Ribavirin Treatments</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The antiviral treatment , interferon-α ribavirin , use treat chronic hepatitis C patient prevent development liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . However , duration treatment need least 6 month severe side effect anemia , fatigue , depression suicidal thought occur time throughout treatment . There study relate issue risk population develop severe side effect fail treatment . Therefore , aim three-year study explore symptom experience related factor patient chronic hepatitis C Infection receive interferon-α ribavirin 24 week develop prediction model individual predict relative risk failure occurence severe side effect interrupt treatment . Patients recruit outpatient two hospital Northern Middle Taiwan . A longitudinal study design one-year follow-up pre-treatment , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12,16,20 , 24 week treatment , 4 , 12 , 24 week post-treatment . The basic information include laboratory data , Symptom Distress Scale , Fatigue Symptom Inventory , Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale , MOS , Short-Form 12 Health-Related Quality Life questionnaire use assess patient ' demographic characteristic , symptom experience , fatigue , depression , anxiety , sleep disturbance , quality life treatment . Three hundred patient interview within three year . The data analyze use descriptive , independent t-test , Pearson 's correlation , Analysis Variances , generalize estimate equation , logistic regression , classification tree . We expect study explore characteristic population high risk treatment failure severe side effect treatment Taiwan . In addition , result provide information clinician researcher tailor intervention individual need .</detailed_description>
