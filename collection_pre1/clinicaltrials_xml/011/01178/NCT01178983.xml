	<brief_summary>In recent decade , technology development , computer workstation become fundamental work home environment , use routinely many purpose . Musculoskeletal disorder ( MSD ) often characterized backache , neck upper extremity pain , discomfort pain joint , muscle soft tissue . Since find many musculoskeletal disorder connect , among others , biomechanical psychosocial factor relate person 's work environment , literature refers Work Related MSD ( WRMSD ) . Risk factor correlate WRMSD include repetitive motion , awkward position static muscle load prolonged period time , use high keystroke force , direct mechanical pressure , vibration extreme temperature . Computer operator find sit statically long time front computer keyboard , limited option change body position . Psychosocial factor also implicate workstation musculoskeletal disorder computer operator . Workers WRMSD may suffer persistent pain , loss function work disability . Therefore , may include change employment earnings injured worker . The complex nature injury suggest workplace rehabilitation intervention crucial aspect treatment management . The main objective study explore use biofeedback intervention , base tele-rehabilitation principle , computer operator suffer WRMSD . Treatment efficacy test use RULA ( Rapid Upper Limb Assessment ) method . Data analysis do ANOVA Repeated Measures . Hypothesis : Biofeedback intervention , base tele-rehabilitation principle , find effective computer operator suffer WRMSD .</brief_summary>
