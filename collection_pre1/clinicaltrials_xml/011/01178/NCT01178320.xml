	<brief_summary>Heart attack stroke cause unstable atherosclerotic plaque remain leading cause death United States . Unstable plaque often fat stable plaque . This study investigate treatment LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising compare LDL-lowering alone would effectively reduce plaque fat content assess magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , therefore , reduce heart attack stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Plaque Characteristics MRI AIM-HIGH ( Carotid MRI Substudy )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although study suggest plaque morphology composition important determinant plaque stability , understand plaque tissue component mainly histological study recent development MRI technique . A low level HDL associate high risk cardiovascular event increase amount lipid content carotid plaque . Treatment LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising compare LDL-lowering alone effectively protect atherosclerosis progression . It widely believe HDL apolipoproteins mediate removal excess free cholesterol peripheral cell cholesterol deliver via either LDL HDL liver excretion bile . However , test approved human atherosclerotic condition vivo . The NIH/Abbott-funded multi-center AIM-HIGH trial design compare clinical efficacy LDL-lowering alone statin versus LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising statin plus nicotinic acid combination therapy patient establish vascular disease high triglyceride low HDL . We propose conduct carotid MRI sub-study 220 subject enrol AIM-HIGH investigate important vascular biological mechanism HDL-raising therapy . Image collection occur 3 timepoints . The hypothesis specific aim : - ( 1 ) To test primary hypothesis compare LDL-lowering alone , intensive LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising therapy decrease mean plaque lipid composition carotid artery assess MRI . - ( 2 ) To test hypothesis compare LDL-lowering alone , intensive LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising therapy decrease plaque burden include volume wall thickness . - ( 3 ) To test hypothesis increase plaque lipid composition vessel wall thickness MRI associate increase risk cardiovascular event . - ( 4 ) To test hypothesis LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising , compare LDL-lowering alone , promote rapid plaque lipid depletion . And determine time-course atherosclerotic plaque lipid depletion lipid therapy . - ( 5 ) To examine association clinical risk factor , lipid , lipoprotein heterogeneity , inflammatory marker carotid plaque characteristic . This MRI sub-study offer unique opportunity investigate effectiveness LDL-lowering plus HDL-raising therapy human atherosclerotic plaque vivo , examine association plaque characteristic lipid composition volume assess MRI cardiovascular outcome , gain novel insight understand atherosclerotic plaque pathology mechanism intensive lipid management prevent cardiovascular event .</detailed_description>
