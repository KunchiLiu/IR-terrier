	<brief_title>Prevention Severe Hypoglycaemia With Hypo-Safe Hypoglycaemia Alarm Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The near-normalization glycemic control become establish treatment goal diabetes order reduce risk late complication nephropathy , neuropathy , retinopathy cardiovascular disease ( 1 ) . However , frequency insulin-induced hypoglycaemia increase several-fold intensified insulin therapy ( 2 ; 3 ) hypoglycaemia common acute complication insulin-treated diabetes . The fear hypoglycaemia discourage diabetic subject attempt maintain tight glycemic control , turn lead increase diabetes related morbidity mortality ( 4 ; 5 ) . Symptoms hypoglycaemia classify autonomic ( warn ) symptom cause release catecholamine neuroglycopenic symptom cause lack glucose supply brain . Symptoms hypoglycaemia may compromise night-time ( nocturnal asymptomatic hypoglycaemia ) due impair glucose counterregulatory response adrenaline glucagon . Some 25 % patient type 1 diabetes suffer unawareness various degree increase long diabetes duration tight glycemic control ( 4 ; 6 ; 7 ) . Several study evaluate potential use continuous glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) hypoglycaemia alarm far fail show reduction frequency severe hypoglycaemia ( 8 ; 9 ) . Although technology continuously improve still associate number problem ( 10 ) . The technique rather imprecise , particularly low range glucose measurement , 33 % hypoglycemic event detect large clinical trial ( 11 ) . The accuracy reading reduce rapid change blood glucose occur ( 12 ) . There significant variable delay change blood glucose change interstitial compartment range 4 - 10 minute ( 13 ) catheter rather costly must replace every 72 hour . The EEG signal reflect functional state metabolism brain . The brain almost totally dependent continuous supply glucose , glucose level lower metabolic requirement brain , function deteriorates . Neuroglycopenic hypoglycaemia insulin-treated diabetic patient associate characteristic change EEG decrease alpha activity increase delta theta activity ( 14-17 ) . These change clearly see blood glucose ~2.0mmol/l ( 14 ; 15 ) preceding development severe cognitive dysfunction ( 18 ) . We recently demonstrate hypoglycaemia-associated EEG-changes record subcutaneously place electrode use automated mathematical algorithm base non-linear spectral analysis EEG-changes predefined threshold demonstrate 10 minute development severe hypoglycaemia majority patient ( 19 ) . We find low rate false alarm adverse reaction relate implantation electrode . We subsequently perform number study real-time alarm type 1 diabetes patient expose insulin induced hypoglycaemia . In study patient instructed ingest carbohydrate he/she hear alarm sound . In three four case patient able , fourth patient spontaneously ingest meal although , fully conscious clinically affect hypoglycaemia . These finding hold promise alarm , give time EEG-changes , help patient avoid severe hypoglycaemia ingestion carbohydrate . For clinical applicability device able distinguish hypoglycaemia-induced EEG change noise , artefacts physiological variation EEG include low-frequency wave see sleep , high sensitivity specificity use mathematical algorithm classifies EEG real-time . There `` time-window '' hypoglycaemia-induced EEG change severe cognitive impairment . The device fully compatible normal everyday activity . Thus , device small , fully biocompatible implantable , monitor process unit small sufficient battery power . This first large scale trial test clinical applicability hypoglycaemia-alarm base real-time analysis EEG-signals .</detailed_description>
