	<brief_title>Comparison Pulmonary Complications Related Sleeve Gastrectomy Gastric Banding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity define body mass index ( BMI ) 30 ( 1 ) . Its frequency varies accord social , economical cultural situation . Approximately 15 % -20 % population Europe , 40 % United States , 80 % Native American Pacific Islands population ( 1 ) morbidly obese , define BMI 39 ( 2 ) . The laparoscopic adjustable silicone banding ( LAP-BAND ) procedure rapidly gain acceptance consider common bariatric operation . In literature , rare case report respiratory complication follow LAP-BAND . Hofer et al . ( 3 ) report case recurrent aspiration pneumonia . Nemni report case chronic cough eliminate LAP-BAND deflation ( 4 ) . Almoudi report case leave low lobe pneumonia 3 year follow LAP-BAND . The patient present asthma-like symptom ( 5 ) . However , study literature address long-term pulmonary complication follow LAP-BAND . Reports previous study medium-term follow-up 4 year focus weight loss decide factor success surgery , rather long-term complication . Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) innovative approach surgical management morbid obesity ( 6 ) . Early data suggest LSG efficacious management morbid obesity may important role either stag definitive procedure . A systematic review literature analyze clinical operational outcome LSG complete define status LSG emerge treatment modality morbid obesity ( 7 ) . Data LSG compare benchmark clinical data local operational data laparoscopic adjustable gastric band ( LAP-BAND ) laparoscopic gastric bypass ( LRYGB ) procedures . A systematic review literature identify 15 study ( 940 patient ) . The percent excessive weight loss ( % EWL ) LSG vary 33 % 90 % appear sustained 3 year . The mortality rate 0-3.3 % major complication range 0 % 29 % ( average 12.1 % ) . Operative time range 49 143 min ( average 100.4 min ) . Hospital stay vary 1.9 8 day ( average 4.4 day ) . The operational impact LSG describe literature . Early , non-randomized data suggest LSG efficacious surgical management morbid obesity ( 8 ) . However , clear weight loss follow LSG sustain long term therefore , possible determine percentage patient may require additional revisional surgery follow LSG . The operational impact LSG stag definitive procedure poorly define must analyze establish overall health care cost operational impact . Although LSG promise treatment option patient morbid obesity , role remains undefined consider investigational procedure may require revision subset patient ( 9 ) . Although previous study report LSG LAP-BAND result postoperative improvement resolution comorbid condition associate obesity , LSG statistically show significantly high rate resolution improvement DM , HTN , LPD . There significant difference group DJD , GERD , OSA , asthma ( 2 ) . The incidence pulmonary complication report . This study retrospectively compare rate pulmonary complication follow LAP-BAND LSG surgery . The effect surgery comorbid condition type 2 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , hypertension ( HTN ) , hyperlipidemia ( LPD ) , degenerative joint disease ( DJD ) , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , asthma two subpopulation also assess .</detailed_description>
