	<detailed_description>HIT-RADIO retrospective chart-review study patient positive heparin PF-4 antibody test 1/21/2008 9/25/2008 select hospital associate Transfusion Medicine/Hemostasis Clinical Trials Network . Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) major complication administration heparin result life-threatening thrombosis without thrombocytopenia ( HIT-T ) produce thrombocytopenia without clinically symptomatic thrombosis ( `` isolate '' HIT ) . Isolated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia define fall platelet count associate positive heparin PF-4 antibody test , absence clinically overt thrombosis . While treatment HIT-T ( HIT thrombosis ) anticoagulation well establish , risk treatment isolate HIT unclear . It anticipate data analysis provide current overview implication positive heparin PF-4 antibody test clinical practice . It determine percentage positive heparin PF-4 antibody test associate thrombocytopenia thrombosis ( HIT-T ) `` isolate '' HIT diagnosis subsequent major clinical outcome death , limb amputation/gangrene , new thrombosis . No `` snapshot '' HIT patient conduct past decade result important assessing impact HIT current medical care well document current treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
