	<brief_summary>This open label two-arm randomize prospective study two treatment P. vivax malaria . Patients meet study inclusion criterion enrol allocate either chloroquine alone chloroquine plus primaquine ( 0.25mg/kg/day 14 day ) . Patients followed-up 1 year , clinical laboratory examination visit . Patients recurrent P. vivax infection treat medication initially randomize unless contraindicate . Recurrences two arm compare estimate risk mean duration relapse , classify relapse pattern early late relapse estimate efficacy safety study drug . Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) analysis use far possible help distinguish relapse re-infection . Samples chloroquine pharmacokinetic analysis collect day 7 study subject well day recurrence within 8 week chloroquine</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Globally 100 country endemic malaria 60 % world population risk get infection around 10 % harbor malaria parasite blood stream . Of four specie plasmodium infect human , Plasmodium vivax responsible 50 % malaria case outside Africa , endemic Middle East , Asia Western Pacific , low prevalence Central South America common cause malaria many tropical subtropical region . Conventional control method rather inefficient prevent transmission specie malaria . This partly due persistence infectious reservoir , take form latent hypnozoites liver , produce recurrent relapse opportunities new transmission several year initial infection . Primaquine ( PQ ) available drug regimen eliminate persist liver stage ( hypnozoites ) P. vivax , use 14 day ineffective prevent relapse 15 mg daily dose ( 0.25mg/kg ) Southeast Asia Brazil , high dose 22.5 mg daily Southwest Pacific . Due high relapse rate , primaquine regimen 30 mg daily ( 0.5 mg/kg ) 14 widely recommend glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) normal patient . P.vivax predominant specie Pakistan eastern Afghanistan . In area G6PD deficiency common trait ( 7 % Pakistani 14 % Afghan Pashtoon respectively ) . However facility test G6PD deficiency available hence routine administration primaquine recommend national guideline risk severe haemolysis test . Several national malaria programme Asia adopt truncated 5-day course PQ vivax malaria reduce risk haemolysis reasonable level increase compliance rate . Recently document ineffective reducing relapse rate amongst Afghan refugee Pakistan supervise 14 day course significantly reduce frequency second third episode disease . This also confirm study India . Use 14 day course recommend G6PD status individual know , , currently , compliance full course assure . However supervision patient 14 day post presentation seldom feasible majority setting vivax malaria predominates . Therefore supposition patient low literacy population comply 14 day course treatment absence supervision need confirm normal operational condition . Compliance take drug monitor direct observation chemical assay residue blood interference may , , affect compliance .</detailed_description>
