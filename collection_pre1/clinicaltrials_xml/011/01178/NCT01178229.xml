	<brief_summary>Objective : evaluate effect physiotherapy anteroposterior airway size group bruxist child Question : Is physiotherapeutic technique aim change head posture , effective increase anteroposterior dimension upper airway bruxist child ? Hypothesis : The bruxist child treat physiotherapy present high airway dimension Design : randomized clinical trial allocation blind examiner . Participants : 3 6 year old child complete primary dentition , dental skeletal class I occlusion . The participant classify bruxist accord minimal criterion ICSD bruxism . The child randomize experimental ( n=13 ) control ( n=13 ) group . Intervention : A physiotherapeutic intervention use Awareness movement technique apply child experimental group week , 10 session complete . Outcome measure : anteroposterior measurement nasopharynx , oropharynx hypopharynx take lateral cephalogram standardize technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The physiotherapeutic intervention base Awareness Through Movement ( ATM ) ( Goldman 2003 , Malmgren-Olson et al 2001 ) technique . It establish method movement re-education coordination posture significant factor . Its proponent believe effective efficient action emerge guided exploration movement promote improved attention awareness refines ability detect information make perceptual discrimination . `` Awareness Movement '' ( ATM ) ( Stephens et al 2006 ) process facilitates learn strategy improve organization coordination body movement develop spatial kinesthetic awareness body-segment relationship rest motion , awareness ease movement , reduce effort action , increase learn feeling muscle long action breathing . Ten physiotherapeutic session plan ten week period , base child game . Each session last three hour . The child experimental group parent guide two expert physiotherapist previously standardize session take place room round mirror , child able see movement . The parent help child session home plan indicate weekly . Each session pursue follow step : 1 . Presentation parent somatic awareness technique day . 2 . Movements , game , motor tale exercise performed child , guide parent guide physiotherapist . 3 . In session , guide book cartoon give child parent reinforce exercise home keep long-term result regard body head posture . The guide book design created physiotherapist , teacher advertiser participate study . 4 . After first session , feedback give start next session , exercise home difficulty review solve . All child assist together session instruction instrument give child parent . Error method There statistically significant difference , regard age two group . Standardizations examiner calibration technique evaluate child regard clinical examination physiotherapeutic evaluation make 12 subject different one include investigation . The Intratester ( ICC &gt; 0.9 2-way ANOVA ) intertester error ( Kappa &gt; 0.7 ) statistically significant . A calibration x-ray technique standardization digital tracing cephalogram also perform . The trace cephalogram standardize three investigator 5 x-ray , scan trace two time three investigator . To determine Intratester intertester reliability , intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC &gt; 0.3 ) Kappa test apply . A lateral cephalogram take immediately 10 session physiotherapeutic intervention child Natural Head Posture technique , describe previously different author ( Solow Tallgren 1976 ) . The technique reproducible ( Siersbaek-Nielsen Solow 1982 ) allow clinician evaluate natural position cervical vertebras inclination cervical column head posture . Afterwards , digital record lateral cephalograms process agree Sayinsu et al 2006 , use program develop Matlab 5.3 ( MathWorks , Inc. , MA . USA ) . Anteroposterior measurement nasopharynx , oropharynx hypopharynx take lateral cephalogram standardize technique . The method error range 0.27 0.64 degree coefficient reliability 0.97 1.00 Data analysis The sample size calculate confidence 95 % statistical power 80 % . The number subject require group order make comparison 12 . Distributions test use Shapiro-Wilk test . The data compare use Mann Whitney chi square test . For test , significance set 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Comparisons among group perform variable ( measurement airway ) order answer research question . Results : Statistically significant increase find measurement oropharynx ( 3 mm increase . 95 % CI 0.22 0.32 ) hypopharynx ( 3 mm increase 95 % CI 0.11 0.20 ) child receive treatment physiotherapy . Conclusion : The physical therapy change head posture bruxist child useful increase dimension airway bruxist child .</detailed_description>
