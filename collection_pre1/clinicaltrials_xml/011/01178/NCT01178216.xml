	<brief_summary>Organ transplantation offer hope normal life patient end-stage renal disease dialysis ( ESRD ) . For patient antibody human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) , transplantation extremely difficult impossible since pre-formed antibody cause severe rejection loss transplant organ . Intravenous gamma globulin ( IVIG ) reduce eliminate antibody patient allow successful transplantation . This breakthrough allow patient previously consider transplantable receive life-saving transplant . However , IVIG alone always eradicate anti-HLA antibody degree allow transplantation proceed . In study , investigator propose add additional treatment ( Rituxan ) , humanize antibody direct CD20 antigen present B-cells ( B-cells make antibody , Rituxan help eliminate source anti-HLA deleting cell make ) . Both IVIG Rituxan approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) numerous immunologic disorder Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , respectively . However , neither yet approve FDA desensitization highly-HLA sensitize transplant patient . Previously conduct pilot study demonstrate IVIG + Rituxan fill important gap current therapeutic approach management highly sensitized patient may become standard approach manage patient . This study recently update observation subject transplant desensitization IVIG alone experience high rate antibody rejection graft loss . The primary objective revise protocol examine safety efficacy IVIG 2gm/kg ( maximum dose 140g ) give day # 0 &amp; day # 30 plus Rituximab 1gm give day # 15 . Transplanted patient receive additional dos Rituximab 1gm 3 month post-transplant donor specific antibody ( DSA ) level remain become positive 6M de novo DSA occur . All transplant patient remain DSA negative , receive additional Rituximab . All transplant patient protocol biopsy transplant 12 month . All subject complete 5 visit pre-transplant phase study . Patients transplant additional 5 post-transplant visit . The following research-related procedure : 1 . Rituxan infusion . 2 . Kidney allograft biopsy ( Intra-op 12 month post transplant ) 3 . Rituxan level , HACA level 4 . Immunologic biomarkers ( CD19+ , CD38+ , CD27+ ) Although Dr. Jordan commonly use treatment regimens Cedars-Sinai Medical Center , IVIG treatment consider standard care highly HLA-sensitized patient . The investigational component study addition Rituxan currently study ammended safety efficacy study focus decrease HLA antibody pre-transplant minimize DSA post transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Immune Globulin ( IVIG ) Plus Rituximab Desensitization Highly HLA Sensitized Patients Awaiting Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , Phase I/II , exploratory study modify safety/efficacy study provide patient IVIG Rituximab . The trial examine safety efficacy human polyclonal IVIG 10 % , give [ 2.0 gm/kgx2 ] , + Rituximab 1gm reduce donor-specific antibody ( DSA ) level permissive transplantation 75 subject ( adult age &gt; 18 yr ) highly-HLA sensitize await decease donor kidney transplant . Once transplant offer entertain , donor-specific crossmatch perform . If acceptable crossmatches DSA level see , patient proceed DD transplantation . Patients receive transplant receive additional dose IVIG transplantation ( within 10 day ) receive additional dos Rituximab 1g 3M post transplant DSA level remain become positive 6M de novo DSA occur . Patients desensitize transplanted 9M desensitization complete study treat best judged physician .</detailed_description>
