	<brief_title>Trientine Carboplatin Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Trientine design remove excess copper body , may cause cancer cell stop grow . Carboplatin design block growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level carboplatin base join study . Up 3 dose level carboplatin test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level carboplatin . The first group participant receive low dose level carboplatin . Each new group receive high dose carboplatin group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . The dose level trientine base blood level copper . These level may vary person person . Expansion Groups : Once high tolerable dose study drug combination find , two expansion group , one group 28 extra participant ( Group A ) one group 14 extra participant ( Group B ) . Group A receive study combination high tolerable dose . Group B receive extra dos trientine start Day 1 Cycle 1 . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Groups : In additional Expansion Groups , high tolerable dose study drug combination find , also 2 PK group . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . There 6 participant group . These group also receive study combination high tolerable dose . There extra blood draw group drug administration schedule different group describe . For participant , dose study drug may lower intolerable side effect . You receive high dose dose level first assign . Study Drug Administration : Dose Escalation Expansion Groups : On Day 1 28-day cycle , receive carboplatin vein 2 hour . Starting Day 1 Cycle 1 , begin take trientine mouth several time day . If Expansion Group B , receive extra dos trientine within 14 day Day 1 Cycle 1 . Your study doctor tell take trientine whether take without food . You also tell many pill take . PK Groups : Both group take study drug describe . However , PK Group A , instead Day 1 Cycle 1 , start take trientine daily begin Day 2 Cycle 1 . If PK Group B , Day 21 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 eat 2 hour 2 hour take trientine . Study Visits : Within 7 day first dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 1/2 tablespoon ) draw measure level ceruloplasmin ( copper-carrying protein ) copper , iron blood . - Women able become pregnant must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . - If doctor think need , may electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and/or echocardiogram ( ECHO ) check heart function . An ECG test measure electrical activity heart Every week doctor decide take correct dose trientine : - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw measure level ceruloplasmin blood . Every week Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Once cycle : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn measure level copper iron blood . - You ask side effect may . At end every 2 cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : - You CT , MRI , PET scan , and/or x-ray check status disease . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . PK Groups : If PK Group A , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 7 time 6 hour receive carboplatin . - On Day 2 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time . - On Day 1 Cycle 2 , blood drawn 7 time 6 hour receive carboplatin . - On Day 2 Cycle 2 , blood drawn 1 time . If PK Group B , blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn : - On Day 21 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 7 time 6 hour dose trientine . - On Day 22 Cycle 1 , draw 1 time . - On Day 1 Cycle 2 , drawn 7 time 6 hour receive carboplatin . - On Day 2 Cycle 2 , blood drawn 1 time . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect may experience . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . This investigational study . Trientine FDA approve commercially available treatment Wilson 's disease . Trientine FDA approve treatment advanced cancer . Carboplatin FDA approve commercially available treatment ovarian cancer . The combination trientine carboplatin treat advance cancer investigational . Up 72 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
