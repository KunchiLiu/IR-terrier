	<brief_summary>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) continue profound impact individual , family , health care system . Despite marked success treat active individual episode unipolar depression , understand neural cognitive mechanism involve return symptom remain extremely limited , intervention exist specifically target factor involve prophylaxis . The research propose among first design examine neurocognitive marker depressive relapse vulnerability link directly clinical prognosis . Hypothesis 1 : Cortical midline structure ( CMS ) network recruitment associate behavioural neural index reflexive attentional bias towards dysphoric stimulus divide attention task . Hypothesis 2 : Behavioural neural index dysphoric attentional bias follow mood challenge predict depression relapse prospective 18-month follow . Hypothesis 3 : Relative CBT , Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) normalize CMS right insular/fronto-opercular cortex ( INS-FO ) network imbalance . Hypothesis 4 : Relative CBT , MBCT normalize healthy control level , behavioural neural index dysphoric attentional bias , predictive reduce relapse risk across 24 month follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Relapse recurrence follow recovery Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) common debilitate outcome carry enormous social cost [ 1-3 ] . Our CIHR fund program research study nature psychological vulnerability affective disorder . We recently identify activation depressive cognitive mode trigger temporary dysphoric state reliable risk marker depressive relapse [ 4 , see attached ] . In parallel , functional imaging study increase understanding neural mechanism underlie normative affective response [ 5 ] begin examine dysregulation affective disorder [ 6-8 ] . Our research identify potential brain biomarkers predict episode relapse unipolar depression . However , remain unknown potential biomarkers relate dysphoria-triggered information processing mode also predict relapse , whether neurocognitive vulnerability amenable intervention , result lasting prophylaxis . The present proposal employ cognitive neuroscience approach examine whether previously identify neural marker depression relapse prophylaxis associate dysphoric information processing mode . In particular , use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) behavioural probe undertake finely tune examination mood link bias attention toward dysphoric stimulus event ( i.e. , sad face ) link previously identify neural marker specific information processing mode . Further , preliminary data present demonstrate correlation mood link neural marker relapse , demonstrate marker causally relate relapse prophylaxis . To address , examine whether marker associate dysphoric attentional bias 1 ) modifiable via attentional training design overcome reflexive mode think perception 2 ) predictive relapse status across 24-month prospective follow treat patient . This research elucidate neural information processing correlate may signal relapse risk recover depressed patient . This knowledge increase limit understanding mechanism underlie endure depressive relapse vulnerability well assess potentially efficient strategy relapse prophylaxis .</detailed_description>
