	<criteria>Written inform consent subject , trust person person legally authorize sign behalf participant ( Legal Representative U.S. ) , depend local regulation Participants acquire hemophilia autoimmune inhibitory antibody human factor VIII clinical diagnosis establish follow criterion : ) Prolonged activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , b ) Prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤ upper limit normal ( ULN ) + 2 second platelet count within normal range , c ) Abnormal aPTT mix study ( patientnormal control 1:1 ) consistent factor VIII inhibitor reduce factor VIII activity level ( 10 % ) Has serious bleed episode , document investigator Be willing able follow instruction attend study visit Participants take antithrombotics ( clopidogrel , heparin heparin analogue ) may include provide three halflives agent elapse since last dose agent Life expectancy , prior onset hemorrhagic episode , least 90 day Participants reproductive age must use acceptable method contraception female , undergo pregnancy test part screen process Hemodynamically unstable blood transfusion , fluid resuscitation pharmacologic volume replacement pressor therapy . This hemodynamic instability characterize symptomatic hypotension result vital organ dysfunction , cardiac ischemia , oliguria ( urine volume &lt; 0.5 mL/kg previous six hour ) , central nervous system hypoperfusion manifest mental status change confusion ( unless head injury intracranial hemorrhage present ) , pulmonary compromise , and/or acidosis ( manifest pH lactate level ) Has establish reason bleed correctable Bleeding episode assess likely resolve leave untreated AntiOBI1 inhibitor exceed 20 Bethesda Units ( BU ) ( prospectively retrospectively ) Subsequent bleed episode site initial qualify bleeding episode within two week follow final OBI1 dose initial qualify bleeding episode , subsequent bleeding episode different site initial qualify bleeding episode within 1 week follow final OBI1 dose initial qualify bleeding episode consider `` new '' qualify bleed episode Prior history bleed disorder acquire hemophilia . Known major sensitivity therapeutic product pig hamster origin ; example include therapeutic porcine origin ( e.g . previously market porcine factor VIII , HyateC® ) recombinant therapeutic prepared hamster cell ( e.g . Humira® , Advate® Enbrel® ) Use hemophilia medication : rFVIIa within 3 hour prior OBI1 administration aPCC treatment within 6 hour prior OBI1 administration Participation clinical study within 30 day first OBI1 treatment Anticipated need treatment device study may interfere evaluation safety efficacy OBI1 , whose safety efficacy may affect OBI1 Is currently pregnant , breastfeed , plan become pregnant father child study Abnormal baseline finding , medical condition ( ) laboratory finding , opinion investigator , might jeopardize subject 's safety decrease chance obtain satisfactory data need achieve objective study Inability unwillingness comply study design , protocol requirement , followup procedure Participant majority age legal protection</criteria>
