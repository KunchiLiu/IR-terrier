	<detailed_description>Methamphetamine ( METH ) use increase US worldwide past year . Although associate profound medical , psychiatric , legal , social problem , effective medicine METH abuse identify approve human use . It vitally important identify compound alter METH effect without increase risk METH toxicity . While brain chemical transmitter dopamine play major role pleasurable reinforce psychomotor stimulant effect amphetamine , transmitter norepinephrine serotonin also contribute substantially effect . Recent evidence suggest functional link exist norepinephrine serotonin system may profoundly important METH effect dependence . However , neurotransmitter system test extensively target pharmacologic intervention . Thus , purpose study examine whether alpha-1-b antagonist prazosin block self-reported effect , cognitive performance cardiovascular effect METH dose-related manner . Subsequent protocols test effect serotonin antagonist , cyproheptadine , combine norepinephrine/serotonin antagonist , quetiapine . Healthy , non-treatment-seeking METH user recruit . They undergo extensive prestudy medical psychiatric screening . Twelve volunteer ( age 18-50 year ; 50 % female ; 10 % Minority ) sign inform consent recruit complete study prazosin . METH-abusing volunteer undergo 6 session space 2-3 day apart . A single oral dose prazosin ( placebo , 1 mg , 2 mg po ) give randomize , double-blind design METH METH placebo administration session . METH give po dose ( 20 mg ) well-tolerated human result easily measurable effect ( Cruickshank Dyer , 2009 ; Sevak et al , 2009 ; Parrot et al , 2011 ) . Prior several time point prazosin/placebo , METH/placebo , prazosin/METH administration , self-report , cognitive performance physiologic measure obtain . The study propose significant potential identify treatment medication elucidate new mechanism action desirable characteristic future medication development . Understanding effect treatment drug context concomitant METH use essential component identify potential pharmacotherapies METH dependence 1 ) alters self-reported/performance effect 2 ) alters cardiovascular effect 3 ) alters concentration-effect ( pharmacodynamic ) relationship METH human METH user . Using broad pharmacologic approach human laboratory study provide insight appropriate combination positive treatment effect minimal side effect ultimate development successful treatment METH abuse . The result generalizable METH abuser development new treatment METH abuse benefit member society . Understanding pharmacologic interaction lessen complication drug abuse provide rapid introduction effective new treatment medical practice .</detailed_description>
