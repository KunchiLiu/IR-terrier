	<brief_summary>This single-centre , phase II randomize study doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) without intermittent sunitinib patient measurable primary breast cancer receive pre-operative chemotherapy . A lead-in phase I study build protocol determine dose duration sunitinib may achieve desired effect normalize tumor vasculature prior chemotherapy administration . A total 64 patient measurable primary tumor enrol Phase II part study . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 either arm A arm B . Patients stratify accord metastatic status ( metastatic v non-metastatic ) presence absence clinical T4 disease . Arm A ( Control arm ) : Doxorubicin 60mg/m2 day 1 Cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 day1 , every 3 week x 4 cycle Arm B ( Experimental arm ) : Days -13 ( -7 ) day 0 ( total 7 14 day ) - oral sunitinib daily ( duration dose determine lead-in phase I study ) Cycle 1 : day 1 - Cycle 1 AC ( 60/600mg/m2 ) ; day 15-21 - oral sunitinib daily Cycle 2 : day 1 - Cycle 2 AC ( 60/600mg/m2 ) ; day 15-21 - oral sunitinib daily Cycle 3 : day 1 - Cycle 3 AC ( 60/600mg/m2 ) ; day 15-21 - oral sunitinib daily Cycle 4 : day 1 - Cycle 4 AC ( 60/600mg/m2 ) DCE-MRI scan perform serially determine tumor response change tumor vascular parameter enrol subject : Patient evaluate weekly toxicity assessment full blood count cycle 1 , day 1 15 subsequent cycle . In addition , patient Arm B evaluate weekly first two week sunitinib administration prior cycle 1 AC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Special test Blood sample - Germline DNA baseline pharmacogenetics analysis . - Pharmacokinetic sampling doxorubicin cyclophosphamide day 1 , cycle 1 AC administration . - Pharmacokinetic sampling sunitinib baseline weekly first course sunitinib subject Arm B sunitinib dose day . - Serial plasma sample proteomics analysis analysis soluble angiogenic factor - Serial whole blood gene expression analysis - Serial blood sample circulate tumor circulate endothelial cell - DNA extract collected snap-frozen and/or paraffin-embedded tumor tissue section ( pre- post-treatment ) plasma ( pre- post-treatment take plasma biomarker analysis ) . Primary tumor circulate tumor DNA genotyped cancer gene interest may influence cancer prognosis and/or treatment response . Tumor core biopsy Arm A : Performed baseline , approximately 3 weekly cycle 1 AC cycle 2 AC , upon completion 4 cycle AC , total 3 tumor core biopsy Arm B : Performed baseline , complete first course sunitinib cycle 1 AC , approximately 3 weekly cycle 1 AC cycle 2 AC , upon completion 4 cycle AC , total 4 tumor core biopsy . The final biopsy may obtain surgery patient schedule lumpectomy mastectomy . The tumor core store liquid nitrogen subsequent DNA , RNA protein extraction biomarker study include gene expression proteomics analysis . Three four sample obtain time point , one tumor core time point store formalin paraffin-embedded immunohistochemistry analysis biomarkers . Note : Tumor biopsy , image blood collection conduct complete first course sunitinib may carry early 2 day last dose sunitinib first course logistics reason .</detailed_description>
