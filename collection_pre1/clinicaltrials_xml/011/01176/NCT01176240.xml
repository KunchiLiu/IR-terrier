	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect investigational drug , Droxidopa , participant neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( NOH ) , associate Parkinson 's disease . Droxidopa study determine effect blood pressure change upon stand ( orthostatic challenge ) . Symptoms activity measurement , include patient report fall , evaluate determine effectiveness study drug . Symptoms NOH may include follow : - Dizziness , light-headedness , feeling faint feeling like may blackout - Problems vision ( blurring , see spot , tunnel vision , etc . ) - Weakness - Fatigue - Trouble concentrate - Head &amp; neck discomfort ( coat hanger syndrome ) - Difficulty stand short time long time - Trouble walk short time long time The study duration maximum approximately 14 week include 2 week screen , 2 week proper dose finding , follow 8 week treatment period follow-up visit 2 week . A sufficient number patient screen allow approximately 211 randomized patient . An extension study also available continue treatment determine appropriate study doctor . This Study NCT01132326 sponsor Chelsea Therapeutics enrol invitation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Two Part Study ( 306A/306B ) Assess Droxidopa Treatment NOH Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systolic blood pressure transiently minimally decrease healthy individual upon stand . Normal physiologic feedback mechanisms work neurally-mediated pathway maintain stand blood pressure , thus maintain adequate cerebral perfusion . The compensatory mechanisms regulate blood pressure upon stand dysfunctional subject orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) , condition may lead inadequate cerebral perfusion accompany symptom syncope , dizziness lightheadedness , unsteadiness blur impaired vision , among symptom . Orthostatic hypotension may severely disable condition seriously interfere quality life afflict subject . Currently available therapeutic option provide symptomatic relief subset subject , relatively ineffective often accompany severe side effect limit usefulness . Support garment ( tight-fitting leotard ) may prove useful subject , difficult without family nursing assistance , especially old subject . Midodrine , fludrocortisone , methylphenidate , ephedrine , indomethacin dihydroergotamine among pharmacological intervention use treat orthostatic hypotension , although midodrine specifically approve indication . The limitation currently available therapeutic option , incapacitate nature often progressive downhill course disease , point need improve therapeutic alternative . Symptomatic OH patient Parkinson 's disease think consequence norepinephrine depletion lead low systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) cerebral-hypoperfusion ( reduce blood flow brain ) . Therapy droxidopa result increase level norepinephrine lead improve SBP cerebral perfusion thereby reduce sign symptom NOH . The present study evaluate clinical benefit NOH patient PD treat droxidopa compare treated placebo . Participation study last maximum 14 week consist 2 week ( maximum ) screening/baseline period ; 2 week ( maximum ) double-blind dose titration ; 8 week double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period ; 2 week follow-up period . An extension study also available continue treatment determine appropriate study doctor . This Study NCT01132326 sponsor Chelsea Therapeutics enrol invitation . Droxidopa : Droxidopa [ also , know L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine , L-threo-DOPS , L-DOPS ] International non-proprietary name ( INN ) synthetic amino acid precursor norepinephrine ( NE ) , originally develop Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. , Limited , Japan . It approve use Japan since 1989 . Droxidopa show improve symptom orthostatic hypotension result variety condition include Shy Drager syndrome ( Multiple System Atrophy ) , Pure Autonomic Failure , Parkinson 's disease . There four stereoisomers DOPS ; however , L-threo-enantiomer ( droxidopa ) biologically active . Stereoisomers enantiomer compound chemical element ; however , may react differently element position different location . The exact mechanism action droxidopa treatment symptomatic NOH precisely define ; however , NE replenish property concomitant recovery decrease noradrenergic activity consider major importance . Droxidopa market Japan since 1989 . Data clinical study post-marketing surveillance program conduct Japan show commonly report adverse drug reaction droxidopa increase blood pressure , nausea , headache . In clinical study , prevalence severity droxidopa adverse effect appear similar report placebo control arm .</detailed_description>

Provide write informed consent participate study understand may withdraw consent time without prejudice future medical care 1 . Score 23 low minimental state examination ( MMSE ) 2 . Concomitant use vasoconstricting agent purpose increase blood pressure ; Patients take vasoconstricting agent ephedrine , dihydroergotamine , midodrine must stop take drug least 2 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior baseline visit ( Visit 2 ) throughout duration study 3 . Concomitant use antihypertensive medication treatment essential hypertension 4 . Have change dose , frequency type prescribe medication , within two week baseline visit ( Visit 2 ) follow exception : Vasoconstricting agent ephedrine , dihydroergotamine , midodrine Short course ( less 2 week ) medication treatment interfere , exacerbate patient 's condition study ( e.g . antibiotic ) 5 .
