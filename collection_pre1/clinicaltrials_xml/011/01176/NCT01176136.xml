	<brief_summary>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) one commonly diagnose childhood disorder , prevalence rate estimate 8 % ( Froehlich et al . 2007 ) . Several primary symptom ADHD relate problem temporal material organization ( i.e . often difficulty organize tasks activity , often lose thing , often forgetful , often fail finish school-work , chore , duty ; APA , 2000 ) . In school setting , problem organization manifest forget complete lose homework assignment , difficulty plan completion long-term project study test , problem keep class material organize . These organizational difficulty become particularly problematic middle school result considerable academic impairment ( Evans , Serpell , &amp; White , 2005 ) . Children ADHD underachieve academically likely peer receive fail grade , retain drop school ( Barkley , Fischer , Edelbrock , &amp; Smallish , 1990 ) . Given relationship temporal material organization poor school performance , clear need intervention address difficulty . We recently seek address need complete small randomized trial organizational skill intervention child ADHD ( Langberg , Epstein , Urbanowicz , Simon , &amp; Graham , ( 2008 ) . The intervention highly effective improve material organization homework management result significant improvement homework problem grade point average . These result demonstrate considerable promise organizational skill intervention child ADHD . However , Langberg et al . intervention implement after-school program operate research staff minimal involvement school personnel . In order promote widespread adoption intervention address organizational skill deficit child ADHD , intervention must feasible school counselor psychologists implement within time constraint typical school day . Accordingly , primary goal study adapt refine exist intervention protocol ( Langberg et al. , 2008 ) create product highly acceptable parent , child , teacher , school counselor school psychologist feasible school personnel implement school day . In Phase I propose research , middle school counselor , psychologist , teacher , middle school student ADHD parent consult intervention developer modify after-school treatment protocol in-school implementation . An intervention protocol develop . The intervention pilot ten child order identify barrier implementation . Measures treatment fidelity , skills acquisition , satisfaction complete . These data inform additional modification protocol improve feasibility/acceptability intervention procedure . In Phase II study , school counselors/psychologists least four separate school district implement protocol develop Phase I . Using waitlist control design , sixty child ADHD grade 6 , 7 , 8 receive intervention . Organizational skill , grade point average , academic impairment evaluate baseline , post intervention 8-week follow-up . After implement intervention , participant ( i.e. , teacher , counselor , psychologist , child parent ) participate series focus group complete intervention satisfaction questionnaire . These data inform final revision intervention protocol . The result product intervention target organizational skill child ADHD potential widespread school-based dissemination . The final intervention protocol effect size estimate propose research lay foundation IES Goal III test efficacy . The specific aim project follow : 1 . Utilize exist organizational skill intervention protocol ( Langberg et al . press ) , focus group case study data develop empirically clinically inform manualized temporal material organization intervention middle school child ADHD aim reduce academic impairment ( Phase I ) . 2 . Refine finalize intervention protocol waitlist control trial ( N=60 ) minimum four diverse school district , collection clinical outcome completion follow-up focus group assess satisfaction , feasibility , acceptability ( Phase II ) .</brief_summary>
