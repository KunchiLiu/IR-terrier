	<brief_summary>Observational evidence suggest vitamin D deficiency may role cause osteoarthritis ( OA ) biologically plausible mechanism explain . There , however , evidence show intervene vitamin D supplementation slow progression OA . This study determine vitamin D supplementation reduce knee pain slow knee cartilage loss OA patient compare placebo . Use MRI provide sensitive measure knee OA change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common joint disorder world . In 2004 , OA estimate affect 1.6 million Australians , total cost $ 1.4 billion . OA frequent reason joint replacement , cost $ 1 billion year . Conventional treatment palliative costly , currently effective medical remedy OA . These fact lead 2000-2010 label Bone Joint decade , musculoskeletal disorder recognise National Health Priority . The primary task OA management identify modifiable risk factor . Vitamin D deficiency common old people link osteoporosis fall old woman men . Emerging data suggests also play important role pathogenesis knee OA . Firstly , vitamin D may direct effect chondrocytes osteoarthritic cartilage ; secondly , chronic vitamin D inadequacy adult adverse effect calcium metabolism , osteoblast activity , matrix ossification bone density , thus could impair ability bone respond optimally pathophysiological process OA ; thirdly , low vitamin D level associate loss muscle strength muscle mass old men woman , may associate increase risk knee OA . Some observational study show vitamin D insufficiency associate progression development radiographic knee hip OA . Recently demonstrate baseline serum level 25-hydroxy-vitamin D ( 25- ( OH ) D ) predict change cartilage volume old adult 2 year , increase vitamin D level associate protective association . This suggest vitamin D supplementation may enhance cartilage bone health , thus prevent disease progression patient knee OA . The aim study compare effect vitamin D supplementation versus placebo knee pain knee structural change patient symptomatic knee osteoarthritis 2- year period . The propose study design randomise , placebo-controlled , double-blind clinical trial . We recruit 400 subject ( 50-79 year old , relatively good health serum vitamin D level &lt; 60 &gt; 12.5 nmol/L ) symptomatic knee OA least 6 month use combine strategy Southern Tasmania Melbourne . Participants intervention arm ( n=200 ) receive 50,000 IU ( 1.25 mg ) cholecalciferol tablet give monthly , whilst control arm ( n=200 ) receive identical inert placebo . All participant provide recommended standard care . Knee structural change include knee cartilage volume , cartilage defect , tibial bone area , bone marrow lesion , meniscal pathology ( assessed MRI ) , knee pain baseline 2 year later determine outcome measure . Other explanatory factor , serum vitamin D level , height , weight , physical activity , smoking also determine study period . Significance : Observational evidence suggest vitamin D deficiency may role progression OA biologically plausible mechanism explain . However , randomize control trial use sensitive method require determine whether intervene vitamin D supplementation fact slow progression disease . In study , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind design , use MRI provide sensitive precise measure knee structural change ensure rigorous evaluation impact vitamin D supplementation knee OA . It first long term clinical trial determine comprehensively effect knee structural change ( cartilage , bone ) utilize pioneer MRI technique limb muscle strength assessment . This study build upon previous clinical epidemiological study support objective Bone Joint Decade organization address National Health Priority Area .</detailed_description>
