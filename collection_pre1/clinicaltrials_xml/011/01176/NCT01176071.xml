	<brief_title>Correlation Between Circulating Galactomannan Beta-D-glucan Clinical Outcome Invasive Aspergillosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major challenge development antifungal therapy invasive fungal infection difficulty assess early treatment response clinical prognosis . Mycological endpoint often unreliable , reflect low sensitivity fungal culture diagnose infection ( 20 % aspergillosis ) . Radiographic endpoint misleading , particularly assess early following treatment initiation . Clinical endpoint ambiguous indicator treatment response , generally include categorization patient outcome well , stable worse . Furthermore , clinical assessment likely confound underlying disease predispose fungal infection . Thus , biomarker interpose initiation antifungal therapy patient outcome would bring much need precision evaluation novel antifungal drug thus serve valuable tool guide decision-taking regard ineffective treatment dose selection product development . The current absence biomarkers represent critical capability gap . To date , study examine prognostic value fungal biomarkers invasive aspergillosis clinical outcome limited sample seize . To address issue , current study examine correlation fungal biomarkers galactomannan beta-D-glucan clinical outcome invasive aspergillosis . The study also incorporate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level , seem useful surrogate marker IL-6 production . The investigator contain sample database 100+ patient either probable proven invasive aspergillosis daily marker level CRP ( first two week antifungal therapy ) measure clinical assessment data ( 2 , 4 ) 6 week post-treatment . The study evaluate whether serial serum measurement galactomannan/beta-D-glucan first week ( ) antifungal therapy distinguish successful clinical outcome fail clinical outcome 6 week patient proven probable invasive aspergillosis . The study aim also explore various cut point galactomannan/beta-D-glucan measurement two week initiation antifungal therapy explore sensitivity specificity predict clinical outcome 6 12 week patient proven probable invasive aspergillosis .</detailed_description>
