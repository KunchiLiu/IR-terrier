	<brief_summary>This Humanitarian Use Device ( HUD ) study . The goal study learn patient experience , include report side effect possible benefit relate use TheraSphere device treatment liver cancer . Because treatment use TheraSphere device must design specifically patient , treatment process also monitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Humanitarian Device Exemption ( HDE ) Treatment Protocol For Treatment Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TheraSphere medical device contain yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) , radioactive material use treat liver tumor . When Y-90 put microscopic glass bead , call microspheres , inject directly liver vein . This allow large dose radiation deliver directly tumor , lower risk experience toxic radiation side effect radiation part body , healthy liver tissue . The radiation TheraSphere treatment stay body begin lose effect within 12 day , due physical decay ( please refer package insert information information regard ) . The glass microspheres stay body point , cause health problem . All visit procedure relate TheraSphere treatment perform outpatient basis . About 2 week treatment begin , small tube ( catheter ) insert vein go liver , usually thigh . TheraSphere Treatment : TheraSphere ( microspheres fill Y-90 described ) inject tumor liver catheter already place artery earlier procedure . You receive least 1 TheraSphere injection receive treatment . If doctor think need , second injection 1 month later . The number TheraSphere injection receive depend size location tumor . The injection take 5 minute complete time . After receive TheraSphere injection , stay hospital several hour staff check possible side effect . If experience serious problem complication receive injection , may admit hospital observation possible additional treatment . Length Treatment : You continue receive HUD treatment indefinitely . TheraSphere humanitarian use device approve FDA treatment rare disorder affect less 4,000 people U.S. year . Up 200 patient receive treatment . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>

Guidelines American Association Study Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) describe detail approach algorithm diagnose HCC . 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status Score 0 1 3 . Life expectancy &gt; /= 3 month 4 . &gt; 4 week since prior radiation , surgery chemotherapy 5 . Able comprehend provide write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . 1 . Any pretreatment laboratory finding within 15 day treatment demonstrate liver dysfunction : • AST ( Serum GlutamicOxalacetic Transaminase SGOT ) ALT ( Serum GlutamicPyruvic Transaminase SGPT ) &gt; 5 time Upper Normal Limit ( UNL ) • Serum bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dl ( unless segmental infusion plan ) 2 . Any contraindication angiography hepatic artery catheterization : History severe allergy intolerance contrast medium , narcotic , sedative , atropine correct premedicated ; Bleeding diathesis , correctable usual form therapy ; Severe peripheral vascular disease would preclude catheterization . 3 . Evidence potential delivery great 16.5 mCi ( 30 Gy absorb dose ) radiation lung single treatment 4 . Clinical evidence pulmonary insufficiency 5 . Evidence detectable Technetium99 Macroaggregated Albumin ( Tc99m MAA ) flow stomach duodenum , application establish angiographic technique stop mitigate flow . 6 . Complete occlusion main portal vein . 7 . Significant extrahepatic disease represent imminent lifethreatening outcome 8 . Active uncontrolled infection . 9 . Significant underlying medical psychiatric illness . 10 . Comorbid disease condition would preclude safe delivery TheraSphere treatment , judgment physician , place patient undue risk 11 . Pregnancy 12 . Tumor type demonstrate image infiltrative , tumor volume &gt; 70 % target liver volume , tumor nodule numerous count , tumor volume &gt; 50 % combine albumin &lt; 3 g/dL , complete occlusion main portal vein .</criteria>
