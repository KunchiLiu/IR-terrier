	<brief_summary>Professor RP Young ( Associate Professor Medicine Molecular Medicine , School Biological Sciences , University Auckland ) team develop reliable genetic test `` Respiragene '' base 20 single nucleotide polymorphism use ( together detail personal family history ) calculate smoker 's lifetime risk develop lung cancer . The expectation whatever score ( estimate lifetime risk vary 5 % 50 % ) result counter `` optimism bias '' smoker encourage smoke cessation assumption support previous research similar test smoke cessation . The investigator plan recruit two group subject smoke cessation one group Respiragene test . Eight weekly smoking cessation session carry Surrey primary care medical centre follow usual format National Health Service smoke cessation clinic use Champix ( varenicline ) , counsel carbon monoxide breath meter add : evaluation questionnaire , fagerstrom nicotine addiction score , salivary cotinine ( metabolite nicotine ) test . The main outcome measure estimation smoke cessation 4 week six month completion seven smoke cessation session . Successful smoke cessation confirm negative salivary cotinine 4 week six month questionnaire use estimate influence Respiragene test compare standard procedure counsel carbon monoxide breath reading .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite 5-10 % probability lung cancer smoker , 50 % believe significantly increase risk Despite , 80 % smoker would like know personal risk lung cancer . RP Young , clinician University Auckland , show three way link biomarkers COPD , set 20 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) lung cancer . He demonstrate strong correlation risk score ( derive family history cancer , 20 SNPs &amp; clinical COPD ) development lung cancer whereas healthy smoker ( developed lung cancer ) match age , gender lifetime smoke habit relatively low risk score ( n=446 lung cancer subject , 484 healthy current smoker . The odds ratio lung cancer risk vary 0.2-3.2 depend genetic risk ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . The Auckland lung cancer risk score 90 % sensitivity score &gt; 4 . The validity 20 SNP gene test also confirm population Barcelona , Spain Liverpool , United Kingdom . The test give trade name `` Respiragene '' . Small uncontrolled trial use Respiragene smoke cessation clinic New Zealand USA show improvement smoking cessation six month Respiragene intervention quit rate 30-35 % . The trial hypothesis smoker Respiragene test full explanation risk score good quit rate 4 week six month ( completion eight weekly smoke cessation clinic session ) control . Smoking cessation six month follow bw confirm test salivary cotinine . Based data Young 's small trial , also hypothesise uplift quit rate see subject high risk score average risk score ( low risk category smoker ) . These hypothesis basis primary end point . The investigator also administer questionnaire subject control twice , 4 week six month ( smoke cessation course ) primarily design evaluate impact Respiragene test relation influence : - component smoke cessation clinic session ( salivary cotinine testing , carbon monoxide breath analyser , general clinic help advice , clinic fact sheet ) - general environmental factor ( cost cigarette , family pressure , work regulation , doctor 's advice ) The result analyse use Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS ) Statistics 17.0 computer programme .</detailed_description>
