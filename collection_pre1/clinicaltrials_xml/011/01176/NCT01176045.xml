	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease common major source disability , whether occur primary disorder component disease onset may trigger modified exposure systemic drug , contact lens wear , ocular surgery adverse environmental work condition . The development reliable , highly sensitive specific test clinical diagnosis dry eye major unmet clinical need , particularly differentiate common condition ocular allergy exhibit similar presenting symptom . Tear hyper-osmolarity central dry eye disease process measurement tear osmolarity could serve highly accurate diagnostic test also measure disease severity mean monitor treatment efficacy . Recently , report literature regard dry eye disease ; early chronic follow refractive surgery , many case potentially previously inadvertently undiagnosed dry eye disease .</detailed_description>
