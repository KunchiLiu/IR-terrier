	<brief_title>Reusable Versus Disposable Draping System Breast Reconstruction Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects enrol study randomize two group . One group reusable drape system surgery investigator currently use second group disposable draping system . Subjects blind type draping system use . Subjects anesthesia time surgical drape place . After subject sign informed consent , assign study number surgery . The study number correlate envelope contain information type draping system use . Subjects enrol , may randomize . Subjects typically minimum two surgery , placement tissue expanders removal expanders placement breast implant . Subjects require sign another consent form randomize prior surgery . Surgeons subject disposable drape system use disposable drape kit include gown surgeon also towel . For subject mastectomy placement tissue expanders , mastectomy perform , plastic surgeon use new draping , towel gown perform tissue expander placement . A swab take wound site determine CFUs ( colony form unit ) present . The swab place tube contain 1ml TSB ( triptic soy broth ) . The tube sonicated , vortexed 15 second . A 0.1ml aliquot solution place blood agar plate incubate 48 hour determine CFU count . The remainder solution frozen . In event infection occur , molecular match do culture determine exact culture . Rodac plat use test presence bacterial culture surgeon 's gown ( Forearm [ volar surface ] ) glove ( palm surgeon 's dominate hand ) also subject 's surgical drape ( Area sternum ) . These incubate 48 hour determine CFU count . This process repeat second surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Females age 18 year age old mastectomy tissue expander placement breast implant reconstruction , would include immediate delayed reconstruction . Male subject exclude study , male breast cancer , rare occurrence undergo reconstruction surgery expanders breast implant . Females age 18 exclude well female undergo mastectomy reconstruction surgery . Females otherwise meet criterion active infection , currently antibiotics treat infection , urinary tract infection , soft tissue infection pneumonia also exclude approve surgery physician .</criteria>
