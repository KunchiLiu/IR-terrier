	<brief_summary>The specific aim study : 1 . Definitively determine therapeutic benefit intensive treatment relative standard treatment proportion patient death disability ( mRS 4-6 ) 3 month among subject ICH treat within 4.5 hour symptom onset . 2 . Evaluate therapeutic benefit intensive treatment relative standard treatment subject ' quality life measure EuroQol 3 month . 3 . Evaluate therapeutic benefit intensive treatment relative standard treatment proportion hematoma expansion ( defined increase baseline hematoma volume &gt; 33 % ) change baseline peri-hematoma volume 24 hour serial compute tomographic ( CT ) scan . 4 . Assess safety intensive treatment relative standard treatment proportion subject treatment-related serious adverse event ( SAEs ) within 72 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The report National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke Workshop priorities clinical research intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) December 2003 recommend clinical trial evaluation blood pressure ( BP ) management acute ICH lead priority . The Special Writing Group Stroke Council American Heart Association 1999 2007 emphasize need clinical trial ensure evidence-based treatment acute hypertension ICH . Consequently , propose conduct five-year international , multicenter , open-labeled , randomize , control , Phase III trial determine efficacy early , intensive antihypertensive treatment use intravenous nicardipine acute hypertension subject co-morbid hypertension spontaneous supratentorial ICH . The primary hypothesis large , streamline , focus trial group treat intensive BP reduction ( systolic BP [ SBP ] 140 mmHg less - hereafter refer intensive treatment ) use intravenous nicardipine infusion 24 hour reduces proportion death disability 3 month 10 % great compare group treat standard BP reduction ( SBP 180 mmHg less - hereafter refer standard treatment ) among patient ICH treat within 4.5 hour symptom onset . The underlie mechanism expect beneficial effect intensive treatment mediate reduction rate magnitude hematoma expansion observe approximately 38 % patient acute ICH . The trial recruit maximum 1,280 subject ICH meet eligibility criterion . The primary outcome proportion death disability 3 month define modified Rankin scale ( mRS ) score 4 6 . The proposed clinical trial natural extension numerous case series , subsequent pilot trial fund National Institutes Health National Institute Health ( NIH ) , preliminary randomize controlled trial patient group fund Australian National Health Medical Research Council , recently confirm safety tolerability regimen goal antihypertensive treatment acutely hypertensive patient ICH propose present trial . The propose trial important public health implication provide necessary information regard efficacy safety antihypertensive treatment acute hypertension observe 75 % subject ICH . BP treatment represent strategy make widely available without need specialize equipment personnel therefore make major impact upon outcome patient ICH . Substantial reduction morbidity mortality appear possible estimate treatment effect size current pilot trial accurate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 year old IV nicardipine initiate within 4.5 hour symptom onset . Clinical sign consistent diagnosis stroke , include impairment language , motor function , cognition , and/or gaze , vision , neglect . Total Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) score ( aggregate verbal , eye , motor response score ) 5 great time emergency department ( ED ) arrival . International normalized ratio ( INR ) value &lt; 1.5 CT scan demonstrates intraparenchymal hematoma manual hematoma volume measurement &lt; 60 cc . For subject randomize prior IV antihypertensive administration : SBP great 180 mmHg* prior IV antihypertensive treatment ( include prehospital treatment ) AND WITHOUT spontaneous SBP reduction 180 mmHg time randomization OR For subject randomize IV antihypertensive administration : SBP great 180 mmHg* prior IV antihypertensive treatment ( include prehospital treatment ) AND WITHOUT SBP reduction 140 mmHg time randomization . Informed consent obtain subject , legally authorize representative , next kin . Note : Patients SBP &lt; 180mmHg monitor 4.5 hour symptom onset SBP may rise eligible level eligibility window close . ICH due previously know neoplasm , arteriovenous malformation ( AVM ) , aneurysms . Intracerebral hematoma consider related trauma . ICH locate infratentorial region pons cerebellum . Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) associate intraparenchymal hemorrhage blood completely fill one lateral ventricle half ventricle . Patient receive immediate surgical evacuation . Current pregnancy , parturition within previous 30 day , active lactation . Use dabigatran within last 48 hour . A platelet count le 50,000mm3 Known sensitivity nicardipine . Premorbid disability require assistance ambulation activity daily live . Subject 's living precludes aggressive ICU management . Subject currently participate another interventional clinical trial</criteria>
