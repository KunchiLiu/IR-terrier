	<brief_title>Telomere Telomerase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A telomere region repetitive DNA end chromosome , protects end chromosome destruction . Telomeres view tip end shoelace keep unraveling . Telomeres compensate incomplete semi-conservative DNA replication chromosomal end . In absence reparative process , DNA sequence would lose every replicative phase reach critical level , point cell division would stop . Loss telomeres lead chromosome end-to-end fusion , chromosome re-arrangements , genome instability . Telomerase `` ribonucleoprotein complex '' compose protein component RNA primer sequence act protect terminal end chromosome . Telomerase natural enzyme promotes telomere repair . It however active cell . It certainly active though stem cell , germ cell , hair follicle 90 percent cancer cell . Telomerase function add base end telomere . As result telomerase activity , cell seem possess kind immortality . Progressive shorten attrition telomere length consequent genomic instability lead cancer describe various hematological malignancy include acute chronic myeloid leukemia . Reduced telomere length document patient progressive BM failure syndrome call Dyskeratosis Congenita . Abnormalities patient include skin pigmentation , nail dystrophy leukoplakia . Mutations telomere maintenance mechanism implicate pathogenesis heterogeneous condition . Myelodysplastic syndrome acquire clonal stem cell disorder characterize in-effective hematopoiesis , increase intra-medullary apoptosis peripheral cytopenia . A number patient eventually develop worsen cytopenia evolve acute myeloid leukemia . A number study investigate telomerase activity telomere length patient MDS AML . Telomere shorten significantly pronounce patient cytogenetic alteration compare patient normal karyotype . Genomic instability develop progressive telomere shorten . The Telomere attrition relate genome instability stress lead up-regulation specified DNA damage focus . These telomere-associated DNA damage point often call Telomere Dysfunction-Induced Focus ( TIF ) .</detailed_description>
