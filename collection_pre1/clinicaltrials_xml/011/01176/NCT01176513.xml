	<brief_summary>Background : - GE-148 ( 18F ) new drug design attach prostate cancer cell . Researchers interested combine drug small amount radioactive material allow prostate cancer lesion appear clearly imaging scan . Researchers also interested determine whether combination help make cancer cell pelvic lymph node easier detect image study . GE-148 ( 18F ) use examine individual schedule surgery prostate cancer . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness GE-148 ( 18F ) detect prostate cancer cancer cell pelvic lymph node use positron emission tomography magnetic resonance image scan . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age diagnose prostate cancer schedule prostate removal surgery . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , image study . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan GE-148 ( 18F ) prior schedule surgery . The MRI PET scan may perform day different day , depend schedule set study researcher . - Tissue sample take prostate removal surgery , include prostate tissue pelvic lymph node , collect study effectiveness GE-148 ( 18F ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GE-148-002 : A Phase 2 , Open-label , Single-Center Study Assess GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection PET Imaging Detect Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Accurate imaging prostate cancer important develop target minimally invasive therapy - GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection drug product formulation know [ 18F ] FACBC synthetic leucine amino acid analogue . Preliminary study demonstrate efficacy primary prostate cancer metastatic/recurrent prostate cancer . We propose evaluate GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection PET radiopharmaceutical detection prostate cancer . Objectives : Primary Objective : - To differentiate magnitude uptake retention GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection malignant prostate tumor , non-malignant prostate pathology , region normal prostate tissue subject prostate cancer . - To assess safety single dose GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection subject prostate cancer . Secondary Objectives : - To assess relationship magnitude uptake GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection quantitative assessment AAT expression malignant prostate tumor , non-malignant prostate pathology , region normal prostate tissue . - To assess relationship magnitude uptake GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection quantitative assessment Ki-67 expression malignant prostate tumor , non-malignant prostate pathology , region normal prostate tissue . - To assess relationship magnitude uptake GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection malignant prostate tumor Gleason Score . - To assess ability GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection detect number discrete malignant prostate tumor confirm histopathology . - To assess relationship magnitude uptake GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection quantitative measurement AAT Ki-67 expression pelvic lymph node show uptake GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection , available . - To compare ability PET/CT image GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection predict prostate malignancy distinguish pathology ( inflammation , hyperplasia , atrophy , hemorrhage ) T2W MRI , DCE MRI , MR DWI , MRSI perform 3T . Eligibility : - Subject 18 year old , ECOG 0-2 , document prostate cancer ( minimum 1 core ) . - Subject must schedule undergo standard care prostatectomy NIH CC Serum creatinine within 2 week prior MRI less equal to1.8mg/dl , estimate GFR ( eGFR ) must great 30 ml/min/1.73m2 . -Chemistry parameter : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , Alanine transferase ( ALT ) 2 x upper limit normal ; total bilirubin , less 2 x upper limit normal less 3.0 mg/dl patient Gilbert 's syndrome . Design : Thirty subject localize prostate cancer schedule prostatectomy undergo dynamic GE-148 ( 18F ) Injection PET/CT imaging , undergo standard-of-care endorectal coil/pelvic multiparametric MRI . Results compare pathology .</detailed_description>
