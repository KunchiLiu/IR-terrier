	<brief_summary>The goal project create Practice Based Research Network 30 researcher dentist calibrate administration caries risk assessment treatment modality recommend base caries risk assessment result ( Caries Management Risk Assessment - CAMBRA ) , conduct 2-year CAMBRA study dental office . Participating dentist mix general practitioner pediatric dentist select private practice , part time university faculty , large group practice , community clinic . Participating practice collect baseline data patient progress report patient acceptance compliance , effectiveness treatment . The program 's duration anticipate approximately four year . Year one dedicate program , protocol evaluation design , recruitment , selection calibration researcher dentist .

	<brief_title>CAMBRA - PBRN Caries Management By Risk Assessment In A Practice-Based Research Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical part project prove CAMBRA principle successfully disseminate everyday dental practice apply principle Caries Management Risk Assessment subject practice major reduction caries see intervention group comparison control group . At end two year clinical part perform Practice Based Research Network data show positive result first CAMBRA study achieve university set UCSF also accomplish dental practice set benefit patient . If CAMBRA successfully disseminate dental practice dental care cost significantly reduce . The overall study objective build Practice Based Research Network ( PBRN ) conduct set 2-year randomize , control , double blind clinical trial provide clinical evidence scientifically base caries risk assessment , conjunction aggressive preventive measure conservative restoration result dramatically reduce caries increment . If successful study perform PBRN provide substantial evidence change practice caries management . The plan study double blind practice-based clinical study . The California Dental Association Foundation help select 30 participate dentist . Practitioners perform Caries Management Risk Assessment ( CAMBRA ) evaluation instruct provide treatment suggestion study subject accord CAMBRA protocol . The hypothesis test caries management base caries-risk status ( low , moderate high ) significantly reduce need caries restorative treatment two ( plus ) year compare usual dental treatment practice base setting . The primary outcome measure caries increment . At end two year clinical part perform Practice Based Research Network data show positive result first CAMBRA study achieve university set UCSF also accomplish dental practice set benefit patient . If CAMBRA successfully implement dental practice future dental care cost significantly reduce .</detailed_description>
