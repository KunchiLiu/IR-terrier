	<brief_summary>Overall Objective • To evaluate impact maternal educational strategy ( teach session train lady health worker , verbal , pictorial demonstrative ) regard appropriate complementary food infant , assess impact nutritional status six month educational intervention . Specific objective • To determine impact maternal educational strategy regard complementary food assess baseline weight , height mid - upper arm circumference 2.5 - 5 month age compare 3 , 6 9 month enrollment . ( Hypothesis ; investigator hypothesize gain 250 gram weight , 0.5 cm length 0.5 cm MUAC infant whose mother receive special education module complementary feeding , compare child whose mother n't receive education complementary food . Secondary objective • To determine impact maternal educational strategy regard complementary food assess morbidity ( number diarrhea ARI episodes , 2.5 - 5 month age report 3 , 6 9 month enrollment ) . ( Hypothesis ; investigator hypothesize 10 % decrease incidence diarrhea episodes ARI episodes infant whose mother receive special education module complementary feeding , compare child whose mother n't receive education complementary food ) . ARI define per IMCI guideline . Increase breathe rate ( age specific ) along cough , cold wheezing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population The study conduct Bhainse colony ( BC ) , Karachi . This periurban community area , cater population mainly belong low - middle income household . The study population would mother ( infant 2.5 - 5 month age ) infants two study area . Inclusion Criteria ; - Infants age 2.5 - 5 month ; either exclusively breast feed partially breast feed start complementary feeding recently start complementary food ( le 1 week ) - Informed consent Exclusion Criteria ; - Infants find 5th percentile weight age CDC growth chart 23 baseline exclude . - History two hospital admission 7 day - Presence serious congenital anomaly ( cleft palate , congenital heart disease , neural tube defect ) chronic condition impair feeding ( e.g . cerebral palsy ) - Presence acute illness require urgent hospitalization - Infants family low socioeconomic status adequate calorie-provision constrain ( assessed questionnaire household possession item mobile phone , bicycle vehicle , TV , cement construction , fuel use cook - wood gas/LPG ) - Infant already enrol trial nutritional intervention exclude . - Infants initial clinical examination find severely anemic . Data outcome measure Measuring Weight , height Mid-upper arm circumference The investigator measure serial height , weight mid-upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) subject enrollment subsequently visit . Each infant measure four time study enrollment . - Height measure twice result average . Duplicate measure exceed predefined allowable variation resolve field supervisor , e.g. , return site interviewer repeat measurement . The height infant measure ( near 0.1 cm ) recumbent position use board fix head slide foot piece . - Weight measure near 0.1 kg use scale calibrate daily . - MUAC measure twice time use measure tape . All anthropometric measurement take three time ( visit ) mean measurement count valid value . Each anthropometric index express standard deviation unit ( SD ) median NCHS/CDC/WHO International Reference Population . Methods adapt How Weigh Measure Children : Assessing Nutritional Status Young Children Household Surveys , United Nations Department Technical Cooperation Development Statistical Office , 1986 . The height weight measurement later convert WAZ , WHZ HAZ score difference group analyze . - ARI measure standard IMCI guideline . ARI could assess physician 's visit treatment prescribed .</detailed_description>
