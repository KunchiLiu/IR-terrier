	<brief_summary>Chronically inadequate B6 nutritional status associate aberrant one-carbon ( 1C ) metabolism health . Plasma pyridoxal phosphate ( PLP ) &gt; 30 nmol/L often consider cutoff indicative nutritional adequacy , 20-30 nmol/L consider marginal deficiency ; however , current Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) value base conservative cutoff 20 nmol/L plasma PLP . As show investigator preliminary data , biochemical perturbation occur human marginal B6 deficiency consistent plasma PLP 20-30 nmol/L . A prospective study also show plasma PLP &lt; 23.3 nmol/L associate 1.8-times high risk recurrent venous thromboembolism PLP &gt; 23.3 nmol/L . The mechanism low B6 intake associate risk vascular disease know . Since B6-deficiency little tendency raise fast plasma total homocysteine ( tHcy ) yield elevate tHcy response follow methionine load , low B6 nutriture may lead repeated transient mild hyperhomocysteinemia follow meal consumption . Several report association elevate plasma C-reactive protein ( CRP ) low B6 status raise hypothesis systemic inflammation prone occur B6 deficiency contributes low B6 status . The investigator previously find healthy human low B6 status cause dietary restriction exhibit normal plasma CRP level . The investigator also postulate oxidative stress associate low B6 status , couple impaired glutathione synthesis , contribute risk . These question indicate need thorough understand metabolic change occur low B6 status marginal B6 intake drug interaction woman use oral contraceptive .</brief_summary>

The labs verify nutritional eligibility folate , vitamin B12 vitamin B6 . If inclusion criterion meet follow take place . The subject come University Florida ( UF ) Clinical Translational Science Institute ( CTSI ) Clinical Research Center ( CRC ) 9 hour infusion ( stable isotope label serine , methionine leucine ) twice research study . Once start study day 29 . Blood sample take metabolite analysis . The infusion nonradioactive , stable isotope label amino acid allow determination rate metabolic reaction one-carbon metabolism . The result subject ' blood analysis provide u information rate several part metabolism vitamin B6 status . During 2-days prior infusion control diet require . The subject feed CTSI CRC . Dietary calculation formulation conduct use Minnesota Nutrition Data Systems software . Subjects come CRC twice per day meet staff , consume morning evening meal , provide sack lunch snack ( include weekend ) . Protein intake kept constant . After first infusion , subject consume self-selected usual diet 28 day along commercial B6 supplement provide 10 mg/day . Weekly measurement blood use verify compliance . All subject consume 2-day control diet UF CRC normalize protein intake , follow infusion procedure identical first . During 4-week supplementation period , subject come CRC weekly weighing , blood sample , consultation staff . Careful screening , close monitoring education subject , along weekly monitoring blood level , contribute high degree compliance .</detailed_description>
