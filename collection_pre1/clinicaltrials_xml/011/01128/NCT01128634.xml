	<criteria>AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring . Male female 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : non childbearing potential include premenopausal female document ( medical report verification ) hysterectomy , double oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy. , postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) 6 week postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1 . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication completion follow visit . Body weight &gt; 45 kg BMI within range 18 28 kg/m2 ( inclusive ) . Capable give write informed consent sign date write informed consent obtain , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Normal spirometry ( FEV1 ≥ 80 % predict , FEV1/FVC ≥ 70 % ) . Nonsmokers ( never smoke smoking &gt; 6 month &lt; 10 pack year history ( Pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) ) Available complete study Any clinically important abnormality identify screen medical assessment ( physical examination/medical history ) , clinical laboratory test , ECG ( 12lead ) 24hr Holter monitoring . If Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure subject include . A mean QTc ( B ) value screen &gt; 450msec , ECG suitable QT measurement ( e.g . LBBB poorly define termination T wave ) . A history elevate rest blood pressure mean blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg screen . A mean heart rate outside range 4090 bpm screen . The subject positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A minimum list drug screen include amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine , opiates benzodiazepine . The detection drug legitimate medical use would necessarily exclusion study participation . The detection alcohol would exclusion screen would need negative predose study . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome ) . A positive test HIV antibody ( test require local SOP 's ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 3months study define : average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) , defined average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) . One unit equivalent halfpint ( 220mL ) beer 1 ( 25ml ) measure spirit 1 glass ( 125ml ) wine . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .
