	<brief_summary>The primary goal research study determine whether treat pancreatic cancer patient hydroxychloroquine combination gemcitabine surgery safe . The secondary goal determine new treatment regimen effectively treat pancreatic cancer . This study test safety efficacy combination two part , phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pre-surgery Gemcitabine + Hydroxychloroquine ( GcHc ) Stage IIb III Adenocarcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II trial design assess safety , tolerability efficacy neoadjuvant oral hydroxychloroquine ( Plaquenil® ) combination FDR gemcitabine subject high risk IIb III adenocarcinoma pancreas . Eligible subject administer hydroxychloroquine orally twice daily ( depend dose ) combination FDR gemcitabine ( day 1 15 ) 31 day prior surgical resection . Dose escalation hydroxychloroquine proceed use Storer 's Up-and-Down algorithm D. Subjects monitor side effect tolerability drug . Pre- post-treatment PET scan primary mean assess response therapy . Resected tumor also assess evidence inhibition autophagy well histopathologic response margin negative resection number positive lymph node .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects biopsyproven adenocarcinoma pancreas stag IIb great EUS , tumor great 2.6 cm EUS pancreatic protocol helical CT scan demonstrate venous involvement Karnofsky performance status &gt; /= 70 . No active second malignancy except basal cell carcinoma skin Normal renal , hepatic , hematologic function time enrollment evidence : Serum creatinine level ≤1.5 upper limit normal Serum total bilirubin level ≤1.5 X ULN White blood cell count &gt; /= 3.5x109/ml per ml platelet count ≥ 100x109 per ml Age &gt; 18 year . For subject obstructive jaundice , biliary tract must drain temporary plastic short permanent metallic biliary stent . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subjects deem surgically unresectable subject unwilling undergo surgical resection . Subjects receive chemotherapy within 12 month prior study entry . Prior use radiotherapy investigational agent pancreatic cancer . Any evidence metastasis distant organ ( liver , lung , peritoneum ) . Symptomatic endoscopic evidence gastric outlet obstruction Concurrent malignancy evidence active measurable disease except basal cell carcinoma skin Inability adhere study and/or followup procedure History allergic reaction hypersensitivity study drug ( hydroxychloroquine , gemcitabine ) . Other concurrent experimental therapy . The effect HCQ , gemcitabine develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . All female childbearing potential must blood test urine study within two week prior registration rule pregnancy . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . If man impregnate woman participate study , inform treat physician immediately well . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat bone marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient exclude study . For patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy , potential impact pharmacokinetic interaction HCQ gemcitabine unknown . Appropriate study may undertake patient HIV receive combination antiretroviral therapy future . Due risk disease exacerbation , patient porphyria ineligible . Patients psoriasis ineligible unless disease well control care specialist agree monitor patient exacerbation . Patients require use enzymeinducing antiepileptic medication include : phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , primidone oxcarbazepine exclude . Patients previously document macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy exclude . Baseline EKG QTc &gt; 470 msec ( include subject medication ) . Subjects ventricular pacemaker QT interval measurable eligible casebycase basis .</criteria>
