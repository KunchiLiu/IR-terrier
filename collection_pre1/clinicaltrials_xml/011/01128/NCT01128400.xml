	<brief_summary>There many substance naturally present mouth may help u taste fat food . Two substance ( lipase CD36 ) examine study . The presence fat food increase food tastiness , therefore people often over-eat high-fat food gain weight . The purpose study determine block lipase genetic variation CD36 gene make fatty food less tasty people eat less . Our hypothesis Orlistat particular gene increase one 's ability detect fat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Determine effect lipolysis inhibition oral cavity orosensory detection fat human . Hypothesis : Orally apply Orlistat increase detection threshold TAGs FFA human . To test hypothesis measure triolein ( TAG ) oleic acid ( FFA ) taste detection threshold three-alternative forced-choice ( 3-AFC ) ascend concentration method two condition ( Orlistat day vs. Control day ) . To control olfactory input , subject assess wear noseclips . 2 . Determine effect CD36 variant fat taste perception human . Hypothesis : SNPs associate reduce CD36 expression associate high FFA TAG detection threshold To test hypothesis measure triolein oleic acid taste detection threshold subject carry common CD36 e-SNP rs1761667 ( i.e . SNP significantly reduce CD36 level minor allele frequency 38-48 % ) . We expect subject least heterozygous expression reduce allele high triolein oleic acid taste detection threshold compare non-carrier subject .</detailed_description>
