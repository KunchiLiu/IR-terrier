	<detailed_description>This application address broad Challenge Area ( 05 ) , Comparative Effectiveness Research , Specific Challenge Topic 05-MD105 , Health Literacy . Half US adult basic read numerical skill ; inadequate health literacy consequence . It associate unsatisfactory patient-provider communication poor health outcome chronic disease include asthma . We find low numeracy associate prior ED visit hospitalization asthma determined numerical skill may attenuate association minority status lower asthma-related quality life . We propose Patient Advocate Intervention ( PAI ) practical immediate sustainable method achieve effective health literacy ( EHL ) ( understand asthma management practice/health system ) . Adapted Patient Navigator Harold P. Freeman , MD inform focus group asthma patient , PAI address low literacy , facilitate patient-provider communication surround self-management navigation practice health system ensure medical recommendation accomplish . The PA nonprofessional guidance social worker assist model preparation visit asthma doctor , attend visit , afterwards confirm understand well facilitate scheduling , obtain insurance coverage , overcome barrier carry medical advice . The primary outcome electronically-monitored use inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , treatment choice mild asthma . ICS use marker successful patient-provider communication . Other outcomes asthma-related : hospitalization , ED visit , change FEV1 , asthma-related quality life . We hypothesize PAI improve outcomes promote EHL . We enroll 84 adult high prevalence low numerical skill approximately 67 % black 10 % Latino moderate severe asthma carry follow Specific Aims . Specific Aim 1 : refine evaluate feasibility PAI Specific Aim 2 : conduct randomize comparison PAI standard asthma education obtain effect size estimate ICS adherence asthma-related outcome future R01 confirmatory randomize trial final version PAI . Exploratory analyse assess EHL mediator , various moderator , estimate incremental cost PAI . This novel project fill several research gap . It 1 ) compare test intervention address literacy improve health , one easily incorporate practice well patient self-management preventive care , 2 ) potentially long-lasting intervention benefit patient , especially low health literacy , 3 ) potentially improve prevention asthma exacerbation , reduce need ED use .</detailed_description>
