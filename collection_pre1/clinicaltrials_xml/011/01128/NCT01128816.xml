	<brief_summary>Sleep Apnea ( SA ) disorder cause pause breathe sleep expose heart oxygen deprivation . It common patient heart failure ( HF ) associate increase risk hospitalization death . It know however whether treat SA reduces risk . This study look whether respiratory device know Adaptive Servo Ventilation ( ASV ) reduce rate cardiovascular hospitalization death subject HF SA . Study subject randomly receive either regular medication OR regular medication plus ASV . They follow approximately 5 year information relevant health collect compare .</brief_summary>
