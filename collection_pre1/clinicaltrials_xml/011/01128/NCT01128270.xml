	<detailed_description>The subject 's general health assess history physical exam routine blood work . I normal individual undergoes five night receive 1.5ug/kg chloral hydrate . On day 6 individual receives 2.5 micrograms/kg Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) kinetics draw . After 30 day subject come back receive 1.5ug/kg chloral hydrate five night kinetics draw night one five . On day 6-9 subject return blood draw . After 30 day process do except subject receives 1gram chloral hydrate five night 25mg/kg Dichloroacetate one day 30 day later subject receive 1gram chloral hydrate five night kinetics do night one five blood sample draw day 6-9</detailed_description>
