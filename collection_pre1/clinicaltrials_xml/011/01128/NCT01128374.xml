	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) become significant pandemic 7 % population United States affect . Moreover , one-third individual may aware diagnosis , involve treatment . In Mexican-American population , prevalence rate may 50 % . Contributing factor poor education , low household income , language barrier restrict access medical service may increase prevalence . The association periodontal disease diabetes well document ; however , interventional study result conflict conclusion improvement glycemic control follow periodontal therapy . Diabetes periodontal disease share common pathway pathogenesis , polygenic nature immunoregulatory dysfunction . To answer question , , investigator , propose randomize controlled trial design elucidate treatment periodontal disease use preventive therapeutic purpose diabetic population well study role IL-1 gene cluster polymorphism risk factor presence periodontitis Hispanic T2DM population . Our central hypothesis Mexican-American T2DM population Texas risk increase presence severity periodontal disease due presence Il-1 gene cluster polymorphism ; furthermore suggest provide non-surgical periodontal therapy group decrease bacterial load associate disease consequence , improve glycemic control measure HbA1c value . Our long-term goal study risk factor associate presence periodontal disease understand treatment periodontal disease use preventive therapeutic purpose Hispanic type 2 diabetic population .</brief_summary>
