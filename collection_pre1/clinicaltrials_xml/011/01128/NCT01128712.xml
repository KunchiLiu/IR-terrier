	<brief_summary>To prospectively demonstrate superior anxiolytic effect high dose pregabalin ( PGB ) therapy ( 450 mg/day ) compare low dose PGB therapy ( 150 mg/day ) subject medically refractory partial epilepsy fully control despite treatment 1-2 concomitant antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Anxiety Partial Epilepsy Patients Treated With Pregabalin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Interictal anxiety symptom report two-thirds patient epilepsy represent underrecognized undertreated aspect disorder . Interictal anxiety postulate stem fear seizure recurrence ( `` seizure phobia '' ) disperse locus control.In addition , anxiety common form partial onset epilepsy view arise dysfunction common neurobiological substrate-the amygdala structure within limbic system . Background Pregabalin Pregabalin ( CI-1008 , Lyrica ) chemical analogue mammalian neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , although bind activates GABA receptor inhibit GABA uptake . Pregabalin alpha-2-delta ligand analgesic , anxiolytic , antiepileptic activity . Rationale Antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) commonly use mood disorder include anxiety.Pregabalin ( PGB ) recently FDA-approved AED add-on therapy refractory partial seizure also demonstrate efficacy Generalized Anxiety Disorder . PGB bind alpha-2-delta subunit protein voltage-gated calcium channel , animal model , anxiolytic anti-epileptic effect via pre-synaptic inhibition release several excitatory neurotransmitter .</detailed_description>
