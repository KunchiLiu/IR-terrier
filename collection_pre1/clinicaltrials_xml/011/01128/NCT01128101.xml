	<brief_summary>Several study indicate chronic kidney disease patient give high cardiovascular risk intrinsic relationship hypertension cardiomyopathy : characterize leave ventricular hypertrophy interstitial fibrosis . The reversal leave ventricular hypertrophy associate increased life expectancy patient . The renin angiotensin aldosterone system play important role blood pressure control . Even patient use convert enzyme inhibitor inhibitor angiotensin II blocker may experience call aldosterone breakthrough phenomenon ( inappropriately call aldosterone escape ) . This phenomenon document patient heart disease chronic kidney disease . Spironolactone synthetic steroid act antagonist aldosterone , historically avoid chronic kidney disease patient , give risk hyperkalemia . However , active metabolite , canrenone spironolactone , able antagonize bind ouabain , Na+/K+ATPase inhibitor , receptor . The Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition result change sodium gradient , increase calcium influx transporter Na+/Ca+ specific region membrane . Spironolactone canrenone previous research able reverse leave ventricular hypertrophy chronic kidney disease patient conservative treatment , turn drug metabolite potential tool reversion leave ventricular hypertrophy chronic kidney disease . The aim study verify safety , tolerability efficacy reversal target organ damage use spironolactone add conventional antihypertensive therapy chronic kidney disease patient hemodialysis , addition measure ability reduce leave ventricular hypertrophy arterial stiffness index . Interventional randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study comprise two group : one take 25mg spironolactone associate conventional antihypertensive therapy another take spironolactone placebo associate conventional antihypertensive therapy . Each group consist 30 patient . Clinical laboratory investigation , well home monitoring blood pressure , echocardiography , determination pulse wave velocity , augmentation index , central blood pressure measurement serum aldosterone evaluate treatment last 12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Materials Methods : conduct interventional , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . The series consist patient least 18 year old , suffer chronic kidney disease stage V dialysis mean residential blood pressure superior 135 x 85 mm Hg leave ventricular mass index height 2.7 power great 51 g/m2,7 . This protocol follow guideline resolution 196/96 Brazilian National Health Council approve Ethics Committee Faculty Medicine Botucatu - UNESP Protocol ( CEP 3439-2010 ) . All patient give informed consent writing . Exclusion criterion thew follow : history evidence angina myocardial infarction , heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , Hyperkalemia , valvular disease , atrial fibrillation , anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g / dl ) dose parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) great 300 pg / mL , patient treatment spironolactone Patients suspend initiate use inhibitor angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker renin blocker last six month . Patients assessed baseline ( run-in phase ) , weekly first month monthly thereafter one year , 52 week . Will include clinical examination visit laboratory test . In visits week zero , 26 52 hold monitoring home blood pressure , echocardiography , determine pulse wave velocity , central arterial pressure augmentation index . Aldosterone ouabaín monitor immediately run-in fase 52 week . Groups : Patients randomly divide two group : active drug placebo group . One group receive spironolactone placebo spironolactone . It important note placebo therapy spironolactone anti-hypertensive drug , patient way deprive benefit establish literature reduction blood pressure . Physicians ' assistant enrol free prescribe antihypertensive medication except study drug . In active treatment group , dose employ 25 mg day titrate 25 mg daily accord potassium . Patients potassium 5.5 5.9 mmol/L reduce spironolactone 25 mg day use 25 mg daily increase dose . These patient receive pharmaceutical care nutritional guidance accord routine unit . The placebo group receive placebo protocol . These patient also receive pharmaceutical care nutritional guidance , beyond conventional antihypertensive treatment . The pharmaceutical form placebo consist colloidal silicon dioxide , cornstarch , lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose magnesium stearate , inert excipients accord reference literature . The pharmaceutical form active drug consist spironolactone 25 mg component placebo . The laboratory test perform routine dialysis unit , follow rule operation hemodialysis establish Brazilian Ministry Health , follow : blood sample collect immediately start hemodialysis routine hematology ( red blood cell , platelet white blood cell count ) biochemical ( urea , creatinine , potassium , calcium , phosphorus , glutamic-pyruvic transaminase venous blood gas ) monthly . Will hold quarterly glycosylated hemoglobin diabetic , total protein fraction , alkaline phosphatase , transferrin , serum iron , ferritin , C-reactive protein , parathyroid hormone lipid level , dosage uric acid six month aluminum annual . Measurement plasma renin , aldosterone , angiotensin II ouabaín hold time zero 52 week . Urine collection 24 hour obtain measurement residual urea clearance calculation protein nitrogen appearance week zero , 26 52 . Will collect monthly sample urine dialysis determination fractional clearance urea ( dialysis dose ) determine Daugirdas 's formula ( 1995 ) . Prior collect sample measurement plasma renin , patient 2 h supine position ( stabilization serum standardization interpretation result ) . Blood sample determination potassium collect weekly first four week , fortnightly second month thereafter hold monthly dosage . All antihypertensive medication maintain titrated accord patient ' need achieve target 135x85 mm Hg residential blood pressure monitoring . Criteria suspension therapy : patient withdraw protocol develop severe hyperkalemia , define one serum potassium concentration equal superior 6.5 mmol/L isolate repeated measure equal great 6.0 mmol/L . Each death analyze independent committee event statistical difference mortality active drug compare placebo , work suspend immediately . Echocardiography : The procedure echocardiography perform accord previously standardize technique . The following data record : heart rate , systolic diastolic pressure obtain examination , systolic diastolic dimension leave ventricular posterior wall thickness septum , internal dimension leave atrium aorta , stroke volume , ejection time LV peak mitral flow velocity ( E ) , peak velocity atrial filling ( A ) , deceleration time E wave ; slope deceleration ramp E wave isovolumic relaxation time . These data use calculate relative thickness leave ventricle , leave atrium/aortic diameter , leave ventricular mass index , leave ventricular mass , fractional shorten ventricular diameter , meridian end-systolic stress , cardiac output index , heart rate , leave ventricular stroke work . Home monitoring blood pressure : conduct equipment validate BHS AAMI ( Omron model HEM 781 INT ) . Patients receive guidance carry three measurement morning upon wake fast three measure bedtime week exempt Saturday Sunday . The measure undertaken patient seat , back support , arm heart level , forearm supine position . Will use upper limb show high blood pressure measurement office , except patient vascular access one arm require take measurement contralateral arm . The patient instruct perform measurement person apparatus . After one week patient bring unit back device memory analyze . Will take representative value average home blood pressure valid measurement , except first day . Pulse wave velocity , central arterial blood pressure augmentation index perform applanation tonometry . The patient fast exam day remain rest five minute start . The analysis PWV hold simultaneously check blood pressure . Begins read placement forearm without arteriovenous fistula support equipment , palpation radial artery apply tonometer sensor . The corresponding central waveform generate use validate transfer function ( SphygmoCor , AtCor Medical , Sydney , Australia ) . Will collect wave pulse 10 second least twice , record directly laptop . After least 20 recorded waveform , average peripheral , well correspond central , also average measurement systolic , diastolic pulse pressure . Statistical analysis : The sample size 24 patient group ( active drug placebo group ) sufficient detect difference 15g/m2 leave ventricular mass index standard deviation difference estimate 23g/m2 , statistical power 0.8 p &lt; 0.05 . However , expect mortality 20 % per year , total sample comprise 30 patient group . The result quantify analyzed descriptively , initially observation minimum maximum value , calculation average standard deviation . To investigate behavior group , use technique analysis variance parametric nonparametric , follow posteriorly test appropriate characteristic variable evaluate .</detailed_description>
