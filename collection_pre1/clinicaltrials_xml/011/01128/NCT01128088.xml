	<brief_summary>Keyhole bowel surgery provide patient improve outcome follow surgery comparison traditional surgery require large cut . In order improve outcomes several variable must control , operation . These variable correct pain relief , accurate control measurement fluid give operation subsequent mobility follow surgery . Previous research already identify enhanced recovery program ( careful control structure patient journey ) reduce length stay complication operation . Currently integral part enhance recovery program require use epidural ( thin tube spine ) provide continuous pain relief 48 hour . Through research previously undertaken MATTU investigator show epidural lead increase length stay delay return normal bowel function . A reason use epidural suppress stress response . The investigator aim recruit patient outpatient clinic undergoing keyhole bowel surgery one unit randomize receive one two different pain relief method operation . Patients follow care standard patient pain relief differ two already well establish modality . They also receive different intravenous fluid . Blood also draw various interval immediately operation future analysis . The trial fund MATTU run approximately 18 month . This trial enable u establish stress response four group correlate patient 's outcome aim refining enhanced recovery program .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Colonic rectal resection procedure . Stoma formation ( previous research MATTU show formation stoma significantly affect quality life degree difference open laparoscopic surgery ) Conversion traditional open operation ( remove element keyhole surgery ) Contraindication spinal anaesthesia : abnormal clotting , skin infection near back , presence neurological disorder anatomical abnormality vertebral column . ( For patient safety ) Contraindication use oesophageal Doppler : oesophageal disease , recent oesophageal surgery upper airway surgery , moderate severe aortic valve disease condition cause bleed problem . ( For patient safety ) Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( confound stress response analysis ) Treatment exogenous steroid proceed 3 month ( confound stress response analysis )</criteria>
