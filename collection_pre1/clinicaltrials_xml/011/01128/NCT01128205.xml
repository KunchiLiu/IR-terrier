	<brief_title>Nationwide Assessment Cardiovascular Risk Factors : Chinese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) worldwide increase 30 million 1985 180 million present time . In China , incidence overweight , obesity , DM increase rapidly due significant change diet lifestyle result rapid economic development . As estimate International Diabetes Federation ( IDF ) , number patient DM 39.8 million China 2007 , anticipate number would reach 59.3 million 2025 [ 11 ] . At time similar number pre-diabetes patient risk factor cardiovascular disease China . DM associate microvascular macrovascular complication could severely affect patient ' quality life duration survival lead significant increase medical expenditure . There number epidemiological survey diabetes conducted country . However , little specific data available status DM control clinical outcome prevention treatment diabetic cardiovascular complication microvascular complication China . This make difficult clinician effectively make medical choice patient variety risk factor complication . This study thus design assess level control CVD risk factor , include blood pressure , blood lipid , blood glucose , outpatient type 2 DM nation-wide across 6 representative region China : Northeast , North , East , South , Southwest Northwest . The difference clinical outcome region three different tier hospital , i.e . tier 3 ( primary teaching hospital ) , tier 2 ( secondary city level hospital ) , tier 1 ( community hospitals/health center ) , make . The primary measurement include 1 ) Proportion patient reach adequate control blood glucose ( 1B ) ; 2 ) Proportion patient reach adequate control blood glucose blood pressure , blood glucose blood lipid ( 2B ) ; 3 ) Proportion patient reach adequate control 3Bs , i.e . blood glucose , blood pressure , blood lipid . Other measurement include proportion microvascular macrovascular diabetic complication , DM treatment pattern influence factor , physician prescribing behavior , etc .</detailed_description>
