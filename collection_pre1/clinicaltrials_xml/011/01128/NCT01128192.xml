	<brief_summary>This clinical study attempt find early study healthy volunteer , injection skin pasireotide associate temporary increase fast post-meal glucose level , along possible increase insulin glucagon level . Glucose refers amount sugar blood insulin glucagon level amount hormone low raise blood sugar . The purpose study evaluate effect pasireotide insulin resistance secretion . Insulin natural hormone make pancreas ( gland inside abdomen ) control level sugar blood . Insulin permit cell use sugar energy . Insulin resistance condition high normal amount insulin necessary allow sugar enter cell . Insulin secretion refers amount insulin produce body release blood . Glucagon hormone ( chemical substance produce pancreas gland body ) increase blood glucose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , double-blinded , single-center study ass effect pasireotide insulin secretion glucose metabolism healthy male volunteer . Subjects give write informed consent show satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion underwent baseline test . An oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) administer Day 1 . If OGTT result confirm normal glycemia , subject continue baseline test Day 2 ( 2-step hyperglycemic clamp test arginine stimulation ) Day 3 ( 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp ( HEC ) test [ 3-3H ] glucose ) . Each subject randomize 1 3 dose group : 600 µg twice daily ( bid ) deliver subcutaneously , pasireotide 900 µg bid deliver subcutaneously , pasireotide 1200 µg bid deliver subcutaneously . Subcutaneous injection pasireotide give twice daily Days 3-10 ( 8 consecutive day , start even Day 3 morning injection Day 10 ) . On Study Days 8-10 , last 3 day treatment pasireotide injection , test perform Baseline ( ie , OGTT ; 2-step hyperglycemic clamp test arginine stimulation ; 2-step HEC test [ 3-3H ] glucose ) repeat . Subjects return post-study safety follow-up visit 5 7 day last injection study drug H &amp; P safety lab ( include fast glucose level ) perform . In addition , depend subject convenience , 3rd OGTT either perform visit perform another occasion convenient subject , order confirm subject ' OGTT status return baseline level . This additional post-study OGTT add protocol amendment . Those subject complete clinical trial follow-up visit amendment approve contacted ask return another follow-up visit . The optional post-study OGTT voluntary subject could choose participate . In order reduce severity gastrointestinal adverse event ( AEs ) , protocol amend ( keep blind intact ) 08 December 2009 discontinue pasireotide 1200 µg bid arm . The randomization scheme subsequently adjust assign subject 1:1 ratio 2 remain arm : pasireotide 600 µg bid pasireotide 900 µg bid .</detailed_description>
