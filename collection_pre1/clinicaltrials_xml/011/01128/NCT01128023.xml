	<brief_title>Rubidium-82 - An Alternative Radiopharmaceutical Myocardial Imaging ( Rb-ARMI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Cardiovascular ( CV ) disease lead cause death Canada . Half Tc-99m use nuclear medicine diagnosis coronary artery disease ( CAD ) SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) . The reduced supply Tc-99m require tracer investigate . While Tl-201 SPECT available , generally accept inferior Tc-99m tracer ; low specificity may prompt test increase cost . Rubidium ( Rb-82 ) PET MPI believe superior accuracy compare Tc-99m Tl-201 , 5-20 time low radiation dose . Rb-82 produce generator cyclotron-produced ( non-reactor ) parent isotope Sr-82 . In U.S. Rb-82 generator FDA-approved since 1989 . Rb-82 PET MPI reimburse U.S. since 1995 use increasingly CAD diagnosis , still consider investigational Canada . Objectives : Primary : To demonstrate Rb-82 PET MPI ) accurate alternative Tc-99m SPECT ; ii ) superior Tl-201 ; iii ) implement multiple Canadian centre diagnosis management CAD . Secondary : To evaluate short-term clinical outcome cost-effectiveness Rb-82 PET MPI diagnosis management CAD compare ) Tc-99m Tl-201 MPI ii ) across image centre . Hypotheses : 1 : Rubidium MPI standardize highly repeatable interpretation across multiple Canadian centre , use current 3D PET 3D PET/CT image technology . 2-A : Rubidium PET MPI superior accuracy compare Tl-201 SPECT MPI , use invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) gold-standard diagnosis CAD . ( reference centre A - Ottawa ) 2-B : Rubidium PET MPI comparable accuracy Tc-99m SPECT MPI . ( reference centre B - Quebec ) 3 : Rubidium PET MPI similar ( non-inferior ) accuracy across additional Canadian imaging centre compare primary imaging centre 4-A : Rubidium PET MPI cost-effective compare Tc-99m Tl-201 SPECT MPI diagnosis management CAD , term tracer cost down-stream resource utilization ICA . 4-B : Rubidium PET MPI improve short-term clinical outcome measure 6 month , compare Tc-99m Tl-201 SPECT MPI management CAD , term adverse cardiac event include cardiac death , nonfatal MI , late revascularization cardiac hospitalization . 4-C : Site-specific attribute impact resource utilization local Rb-82 PET cost . Research Plan : Rb-ARMI innovative multidisciplinary , multi-centre image research initiative build exist collaborative network ( ICT , IMAGE-HF , CAIN , CADRE ) Canadian industry partnership ( DRAXIMAGE ) . Rb-82 PET implement , standardize validated 4 overlap phase 2 year , 10 centre across Canada , include Ottawa , Quebec City , Montreal , Sherbrooke , Toronto , Hamilton , London , Thunder Bay , Halifax , Edmonton . Phase 1 knowledge translation standardization phase ( 0-6 month ) . Qualifying scan use cardiac phantom perform standardize imaging protocol across centre . Site train co-reading initial series scan centre perform reference site ( Ottawa ) , confirm low inter-operator variability ( ≤5 % ) interpretation ( sum stress score sum difference score ) . Phase 2 matched-cohort comparative accuracy study ( month 3-20 ) . In reference centre , pre-test likelihood ± extent CAD assess patient referred assessment ischemia ( N=200 ) undergo dipyridamole Rb-82 PET MPI coronary angiography ( ICA ) within 6 month . These patient use identify match group undergo Tl-201 SPECT compare accuracy 2A . A similar study perform compare Rb-82 PET Tc-99m SPECT MPI centre B ( site ready start Rb-82 PET MPI ) use propensity-matched cohort design 2B . All 800 angiography study ( +600 phase 3 ) co-read core lab Montreal . Phase 3 test whether implementation Rb-82 PET across additional imaging centre Canada achieve comparable accuracy , use ICA gold-standard N=600 patient ( month 4-20 ) . Phase 4 cost-effectiveness study evaluate short-term resource utilization ( RU ) , cost outcome 6-month follow-up : Rb-82 PET v SPECT MPI ( centre A B ) 4A 4B ( N=1000 ) ; Rb-82 PET additional Canadian sit vs primary centre 4C ( N=1000 ) . RU measure follow unit cost estimate . Analysis estimate incremental cost associate outcomes within composite endpoint , well cost associate specifically image subsequent diagnostic test . Cost-effectiveness analysis undertaken accordance Canadian guideline economic evaluation . Database review , follow-up completion , data analysis manuscript preparation complete final 6 month study . Impact : The project meet expect goal RFA `` lead clinical trial application clinical validation study compare novel radiolabeled probe current practice '' , `` bring new radiopharmaceutical clinic '' within short time frame . Increased use Rb-82 PET MPI potential reduce demand Tc-99m 10-40 % , effectively increase available supply procedure , improve standard care many Canadians risk heart disease .</detailed_description>
