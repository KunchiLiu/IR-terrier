	<brief_summary>We propose use inhaled allergen challenge model explore individual contribution component novel long-acting beta agonist/ inhale corticosteroid combination product component protection allergic trigger asthma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomised Study Comparing Effects Inhaled FF/GW642444M Combination , FF GW642444M Allergen Induced Asthmatic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma increasingly common disease essentially cause allergic type reaction immune system . Airways lungs become inflamed narrow result reaction trigger like chemical ( house-hold cleaning product , pollution ) allergens ( house dust mite cat dog fur ) . The airways become block , cause shortness breath wheezing . The purpose study find information effective study drug protect lung allergic trigger asthma . There three study drug investigate study : fluticasone furoate , GW642444M combination fluticasone furoate ( FF ) GW642444M . FF corticosteroid develop treatment asthma . A nasal spray formulation FF approve marketing USA , Europe Japan treatment hayfever ( rhinitis ) dry powder formulation use study yet approve . GW642444M long-acting beta2-agonist develop GSK treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . It work act cell lung , cause muscle around lung relax open good ( bronchodilation ) , make breathe easy . The combination FF/GW642444M develop once-daily treatment asthma COPD . Study treatment take 21 day period ( 4 treatment period : FF alone , GW642444M alone , FF/GW64244M combination placebo ) subject receive treatment . On D21 subject undergo allergen challenge , follow methacholine challenge D22 . The washout treatment period 21-35 day .</detailed_description>
