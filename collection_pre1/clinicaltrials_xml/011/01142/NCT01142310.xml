	<brief_summary>Stress corticosteroid exposure associate change human animal hippocampus . An extensive literature suggest corticosteroid-induced change hippocampus , part , mediate increase extracellular glutamate . In animal , agent decrease glutamate release prevent dendritic change hippocampus secondary stress corticosterone . We develop research program use patient receive prescription corticosteroid ( e.g. , prednisone ) explore effect corticosteroid human hippocampus . Our research program translational focus , goal explore whether report effect corticosteroid animal hippocampus also find human . A current focus research examine glutamate release inhibitor patient take corticosteroid . We open-label placebo-controlled pilot data suggest glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine associate significant improvement declarative memory ( measure hippocampal performance ) population . A definitive study examine declarative memory corticosteroid-dependent patient receive lamotrigine vs. placebo propose . Neuroimaging mood also assess .</brief_summary>
