	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicentric , prospective , post-marketing surveillance ( PMS ) study investigate whether baseline treatment high-dose interferon beta 1a ( Rebif 44 μg x 3 ) , administer high frequency , lead maintenance stabilisation course disease MS subject previously treat mitoxantrone . The previous mitoxantrone treatment include MS subject conduct course so-called escalation accord immunomodulatory escalation treatment plan . An additional important aspect problem collection safety tolerance data observation phase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) Patients Starting Restarting Baseline Treatment With Interferon Beta 1a After Use Escalation Treatment With Mitoxantrone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment relapsing-remitting MS interferon-beta establish first-choice treatment . In previous clinical study , interferon-beta 1a ( Rebif ) use within scope PMS study demonstrate significant efficacy aspect treatment - magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data , relapse rate , progression disability MS . The PRISMS-4 study demonstrate treatment Rebif reduce frequency severity clinical relapse 4 year slow progression disability . In course treatment escalation accord Multiple Sklerose Therapie Konsensus Gruppe ( MSTKG ) guideline , MS subject correspondingly high disease activity predominantly put mitoxantrone . The duration treatment principle limit cumulative lifelong total dose 140 mg/m2 body surface area , may exceed due know cardiologic adverse effect . If cumulative mitoxantrone maximum dose reach subject stable condition , question treatment option present . One possibility so-called 'deescalation ' , , return immunomodulating baseline treatment . Currently increase number subject phase disease eligible correspond treatment decision . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To systematically investigate safety , benefit course Rebif ( 44 μg x 3 ) , treatment large number subject subject data standardize analysis</detailed_description>
