	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States ; 80 % veteran &gt; 2 risk factor CVD . Our study one first examine implementation tailor behavioral/educational self-management intervention primary care clinic design improve CVD risk . The propose study could result leap forward CVD risk management among veteran several reason : 1 ) ) This novel extension previous intervention demonstrate improved BP , design address multiple chronic condition contribute CVD risk , particularly hyperlipidemia diabetes . The study focus multiple CVD-related risk factor management medication management 2 ) The intervention multi-behavioral ; address patient ' various health behavior ( e.g. , smoking , diet , medication adherence ) . 3 ) Components intervention include specific recommendation transportability intervention application software track package allow clinic manager implement intervention effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veteran 's Healthcare : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death U.S. ; 80 % veteran &gt; 2 risk factor CVD . An intervention address multiple CVD risk factor among high-risk veteran great potential improve morbidity mortality . Project Background/Rationale : The propose study take place two VA primary care clinic ( 1-Community-Based Outpatient Clinics 1-primary care clinic affiliate hospital ) . We improve CVD risk among veteran address modifiable risk factor systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) , smoke , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) . The intervention tailor need vulnerable high risk patient ( e.g . African Americans , low literate ) integrate clinic , thereby enhance potential benefit generalizability setting . The propose study could significantly improve CVD risk management among veteran several reason : 1 ) This intervention novel extension previous efficacious intervention , provide novel extension address multiple chronic condition contribute CVD risk . 2 ) The intervention focus multiple CVD-related behavior medication management . 3 ) The intervention develop ensure implementation across large representative sample veteran ; ; 4 ) The intervention , find efficacious financially self-sustaining , could widely implement within VA healthcare system . Project Objectives : The propose study examine two research question : 1 . Can patient randomize clinical pharmacist-administered telephone behavioral/ medication management intervention tailor need improve CVD outcomes relative control group 12 month ? Primary Hypothesis : ( H1 ) Veterans receive behavioral/medication intervention great improvement CVD Risk Profile 12 month follow-up compare control group . Secondary Hypotheses : ( H2 ) Veterans receive intervention improve medication adherence , physical activity , improve diet , low body mass index compare control group 12 month follow-up . ( H3 ) Veterans receive intervention great improvement LDL 12 month follow-up compare control group . ( H4 ) Veterans diabetes receive intervention great improve HbA1c compare control group 12 month follow-up . 2 . If intervention find effective , cost effective ? Project Methods : To address hypothesis , propose two-arm randomized clinical trial design 500 patient cardiovascular disease randomize either education control group intervention group . Patients randomized intervention group receive clinical pharmacist-administered intervention , focus behavioral medication management . The intervention occur 12 month . Patients randomize control group receive educational material CVD reduction . Given national prevalence CVD dismal rate risk factor control , intensive , easily disseminate intervention one propose could significantly improve treatment epidemic VA .</detailed_description>
