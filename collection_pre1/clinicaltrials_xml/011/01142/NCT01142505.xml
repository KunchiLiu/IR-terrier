	<detailed_description>Background A quarter UK child least one attack wheeze preschool period ( 1 5 year age ) . Severe attack wheeze young child usually trigger viral-colds . The majority affect child wheeze cold , although attack may severe repeat result GP attendance hospital admission . This pattern wheeze call `` episodic '' preschool wheeze . A minority preschool child wheeze cold - pattern call `` multi-trigger '' preschool wheeze . In real life distinction blur , preschool child change pattern wheeze time . What clear asthma therapy effective old child classical `` allergic '' asthma may necessarily effective preschool wheeze . For example , although short-course oral steroid effective treat attack wheeze school age child `` allergic '' asthma , investigator show 2 major trial short course oral steroid reduce severity attack preschool wheeze . Recently , montelukast , oral medicine block substance ( leukotriene ) narrow breathe tube , show promise preschool wheeze . However , date , modest benefit report large group child study . One explanation , significant proportion preschool child respond montelukast , subgroup genetically program respond well . Recent analysis trial montelukast suggests responsive subgroup may define variation leukotriene-producing gene . Thus understanding role leukotriene gene leukotriene production preschool wheeze may better target montelukast treatment age group , inform development new therapy . Trial Description The clinical aim trial ass whether intermittent montelukast effective treatment strategy preschool wheeze . The mechanisms aim trial determine whether genetically highly-responsive subgroup child . In design trial investigator incorporate several novel aspect . First , parent able adjust use oral montelukast child 's symptom . This allow u recruit `` episodic '' `` multi trigger '' pattern preschool wheeze - control change wheeze pattern trial . Second , investigator issue trial medication , investigator assess child 's leukotriene gene , focus primarily gene call ALOX5 . This ALOX5 `` stratification '' step ensure equal number potentially `` treatment-responsive '' child receive active drug ( montelukast ) dummy medicine - equal number help u assess role ALOX5 . For trial , investigator first recruit 1,300 child history preschool wheeze , divide group `` responsive '' `` less responsive '' gene ALOX5 status . The investigator issue parent trial medication ; 50 % give montelukast 50 % give dummy medication . Parents start trial medication whenever child develop cold , stop medication wheeze resolve . Parents also able give trial medication wheeze cold . Over 12 month trial period , investigator assess number unscheduled attendance medical practitioner wheeze child . At end trial , investigator determine whether montelukast effective whether difference response montelukast 2 ALOX5 gene group . At time , investigator measure many gene may influence response montelukast , well amount leukotrienes excrete urine attack . Using result , investigator able inform national treatment policy , develop new concept mechanism preschool wheeze inform development new therapy . Since child continue receive `` normal '' inhaled therapy , ethical issue give dummy medicine half 1300 child recruit .
