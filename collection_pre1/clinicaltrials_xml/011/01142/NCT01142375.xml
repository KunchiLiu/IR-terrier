	<brief_summary>Acute leukemias commonly see elderly effective therapy . In recent year , small molecule inhibitor show tremendous promise cancer treatment chronic myeloid leukemia lung cancer . Thus , proposal , intend use novel patent `` indole '' compound conjugate hydroxamic acid histone deacetylases inhibitor , suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid modify structure generate novel small-molecule anticancer compound . By screen acute leukemic cell line , look compound show potential future drug development . In preliminary study , identify novel compound , MPT0E001 , mark growth inhibitory activity , induce apoptosis downregulate c-Myc protein level . We intend use MPT0E001 basis develop novel compound test multiple leukemic cell line primary leukemia sample ( Specific aim 1 ) identify mechanisms downregulation c-Myc pathway NF-kappaB Akt ( Specific aim 2 ) . Once identify lead compound , use murine model ass acute toxicity profile different dose range examine effect blood count vital organ . After toxicity study , test lead compound use vivo xenogenic murine model use cell line primary leukemia . Using approach , hope develop novel compound able used future leukemic therapy .</brief_summary>
