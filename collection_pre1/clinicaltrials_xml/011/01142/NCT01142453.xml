	<brief_title>An Observational Study Evaluating Therapy Optimisation Using High-frequency High-dosage Administration Interferon-beta ( RebifÂ® ) Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment MS , progress attack episode , interferon-beta establish therapy first choice . On basis different study , hypothesis substantiate effectiveness dependent dose application frequency . These realization justify use high-dose interferon-beta subject initial stage disease , also subject , progress disease activity even advance stage , therapy fail . For achieve maximum benefit subject , optimum therapy imperative . The therapy plan ( Immunomodulatory Therapy ) `` MS Therapy Consensus Group '' ( MSTKG ) widely use . In article : `` Optimising lmmunomodulatory Therapy MS Patients '' appear `` International Journal MS care '' year 2002 , simple 9-scale model '' propose defines four area respectively : conspicuous , conspicuous , alarm measure necessary , three area : attacks/episodes , disease progression magnetic resonance tomography ( MRT ) . The modification exist therapy , modify application plan , increase dosage , substance change recommend , 'conspicuousness ' show three area , two area show 'alarming ' area show 'action necessary ' . The decision therapy adjustment help `` three scale model '' happen solely result MRT . The model study involve attack episode pertaining : frequency , degree severity , ability involution response cortisone pulse therapy . OBJECTIVES - To assess effectiveness safety exist immunomodulatory basis therapy MS subject - To identify candidate suitable possible therapy adjustment</detailed_description>
