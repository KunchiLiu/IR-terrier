	<brief_summary>The design study follow retrospective previous one International T-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma Study Group ( International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Project ) . It design prospective collection information potentially useful predict prognosis newly diagnose patient frequent subtypes Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( Peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ) good define clinical characteristic outcome uncommon subtypes</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCLs ) comprise heterogeneous group neoplasm derive post-thymic lymphoid cell different stage differentiation different morphological pattern , phenotype , clinical presentation . PTCLs highly diverse , reflect diverse cell originate . Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas account 5-10 % lymphoproliferative disorder Western hemisphere , overall incidence 0.5-2 per 100,000 per year , strike epidemiological distribution , high incidence Asia . The clinical feature PTCLs extremely heterogeneous . PTCLs express even clinical diversity B-cell NHLs , close , though absolute , relationship unusual clinical feature certain histological subtypes . Despite effort transfer patient T-cell lymphomas recent advance treatment subtypes B-cell lymphoma , prognosis patient PTCL still poor , unfortunately , optimal therapy PTCL still unknown . The complete response rate rather low , range 40 % 50 % median Relapse Free Survival ( RFS ) 2-3 year . As consequence aggressiveness disease low efficacy available salvage treatment , Overall Survival ( OS ) also short long-term survival rate lower 10 % many series . To good define clinical outcome PTCL-NOS , Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi ( IIL , Fondazione Italiana Linfomi , FIL ) perform large study 385 patient diagnose treated 1990s define prognostic model specifically devised patient uncommon disease ( Gallamini , A. et al Blood , 2004 . 103 ( 7 ) : p. 2474-9 ) . In addition define prognostic model specifically devise PTCL-NOS , FIL study confirm relevance research series clearly define case order development rationally design potentially more-efficacious treatment modality . More recently , role biological feature disease emerge important issue understand pathogenesis also prognosis address specific biologic target alter neoplasia . Significant progress prognosis PTCL expect novel , sophisticated , powerful technology genomics proteomics , allow reliable subtyping PTCL distinct clinical group characterize different pattern survival , already demonstrate B-NHLs . One common limitation exist study prognosis PTCL retrospective nature . Currently available data base analysis perform series collect long period time . This aspect important may introduce relevant bias collect series . First classification system change dramatically time case may define differently base diagnosis year . Second clinical laboratory data consider prognostic relevant may determine old series patient . Third retrospective analysis guarantee collect series base real consecutive case . These reason think would useful start new study base prospective registration short period time patient diagnosis Peripheral T-cell lymphoma would possible collect exhaustive set clinical data biological information .</detailed_description>
