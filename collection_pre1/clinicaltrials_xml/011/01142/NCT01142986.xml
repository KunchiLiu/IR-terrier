	<brief_summary>This research do evaluate effectiveness three different treatment strategy help subject begin adjust methadone maintenance treatment Addiction Treatment Services ( ATS ) . Subjects randomly assign one three treatment condition : 1 ) Voucher-Based Stepped Care ( VBSC ) induction , 2 ) Low-threshold Stepped Care ( LTSC ) induction , 3 ) Routine Stepped Care ( RSC ) induction . It hypothesize subject VBSC LTSC condition remain treatment long subject RSC condition . In addition , hypothesize VBSC LTSC subject less drug-positive urine sample report less infectious disease risk behavior RSC subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate two alternative method induct syringe exchange referral routine methadone treatment . The sample ( N=390 ) opioid-dependent injection drug user refer Baltimore Needle Exchange Program ( BNEP ) routine outpatient methadone treatment use step care model . Subjects randomly assign one three 3-month treatment induction condition : 1 ) Low Threshold Stepped Care induction ( LTSC ) , 2 ) Voucher-Based Stepped Care induction ( VBSC ) , 3 ) Routine Stepped-Care induction ( RSC ) . The LTSC condition noticeably reduce treatment demand new admission 90-day induction period conceptually related interim maintenance schedule . It expect increase patient recognition reinforce effect benefit methadone , improve transition comprehensive schedule care , increase early retention . The VBSC condition add attendance reinforcement intervention routine step care induction schedule first 90-days treatment . It expect improve early treatment engagement retention . Subjects condition transition routine stepped-care ( voucher-based reinforcement ) follow 90-day induction period . The RSC condition serve comparison group represent routine care program study conduct . All subject follow 6-months . Retention , drug use ( via urinalysis self-report ) , infectious disease risk behavior ( e.g. , syringe sharing ; number injection ) primary outcome measure . The propose design also test mediational model evaluate change objective index engagement ( methadone counsel adherence ) psychological construct ( treatment readiness satisfaction ) predictors outcome . Regression model use evaluate amount reduction drug use necessary effect vary amount change HIV risk behavior . Finally , data collect compare treatment cost induction strategy .</detailed_description>
