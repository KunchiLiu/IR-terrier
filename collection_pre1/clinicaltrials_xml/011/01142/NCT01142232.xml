	<brief_summary>This research study newly diagnose multiple myeloma multiple myeloma return ( relapse ) . Multiple myeloma type cancer begin white blood cell call plasma cell . Plasma cell make protein help fight infection . Current therapy multiple myeloma include high dose chemotherapy autologous ( patient 's cell ) stem cell transplantation . There two part ( phase ) study : The purpose first part find high dose drug call lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) give combination high dose melphalan without cause severe adverse event . The purpose second part find effect treatment ( good bad ) multiple myeloma patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide High Dose Melphalan Followed Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide drug interferes development tiny blood vessel help tumor grow . Lenalidomide combination dexamethasone approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment relapse multiple myeloma . It also approve treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , another blood cancer . Other research study use lenalidomide combination drug subject newly diagnose multiple myeloma also show good response rate . High dose melphalan approve FDA commonly use multiple myeloma treatment prior stem cell transplantation . This combination lenalidomide , high-dose melphalan stem cell transplantation study newly diagnose relapse multiple myeloma , consider experimental . In research study , `` experimental '' refers drug procedure undergone basic laboratory test receive approval US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) test human subject . A drug procedure may approve FDA use one disease condition , consider experimental disease condition . In study , lenalidomide give together melphalan ( chemotherapy ) hope disease kill stem cell transplant . Three month transplant , patient take lenalidomide hope help prolong time disease remission .</detailed_description>
