	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well paclitaxel without cixutumumab work treat patient esophageal cancer gastroesophageal junction cancer spread place body ( metastatic ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Cixutumumab may kill cancer cell block action protein need cancer cell growth . Giving paclitaxel without cixutumumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel With Without Cixutumumab Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Esophageal Cancer Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival paclitaxel plus cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ) versus paclitaxel alone second-line therapy patient metastatic esophagus gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival paclitaxel plus cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ) versus paclitaxel alone patient population . II . To evaluate response rate paclitaxel plus cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ) versus paclitaxel alone patient population . III . To evaluate toxicity cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ) plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone patient population . IV . Exploratory analyse assess potentially relevant cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ) pharmacodynamic biomarkers obtain serum sample , include limited , insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -I , IGF-II , insulin-like growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP ) -2 , IGFBP-3 . OUTLINE : Patients equally randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour dose 80 mg/m^2 day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day cycle . ARM II : Patients receive cixutumumab IV 1 hour dose 10 mg/kg day 1 15 every 28 day cycle paclitaxel Arm I . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
