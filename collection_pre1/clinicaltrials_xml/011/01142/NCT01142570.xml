	<brief_summary>This single-center , prospective , randomize , comparative , double-blind control clinical study intend establish 1 ) optimal method determine calorie requirement 2 ) optimal amount protein supply chronically ventilate patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Enteral Nutrition Enriched Protein Based Indirect Calorimetry Measurement Chronically Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study perform chronic ventilation department . Enrolled patient randomly allocate receive calorie dictate : The Harriss-Benedict formula ( Group 1 ) Indirect Calorimetry ( Group 2 ) After one week admission hospital department study enrollment review first result study . After seven day hospitalization study enrollment patient wean ventilator , divide three group . 1 . Patients first group receive caloric support calculate HARRISS BENEDICT equation protein dose 1.1 1.5 gram per kilogram weight . 2 . Patients second group receive caloric support measure indirect calorimetry receive protein 1.1 gram per kilogram weight . 3 . Patients third group receive caloric support measure indirect calorimetry receive protein dose 1.5 gram per kilogram weight . Outcome treatment result perform one , four eight week : 1 . Length hospitalization 2 . Weaning Mechanical Ventilation 3 . Development progression pressure ulcers 4 . Infectious disease incidence 5 . Amount insulin need glucose control 6 . Length mechanical ventilation 7 . Readmission Intensive Care Unit 8 . Mortality rate</detailed_description>
