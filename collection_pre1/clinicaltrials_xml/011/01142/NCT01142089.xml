	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Rifamycin SV Multi-Matrix System ( MMX ) Treatment Traveler 's Diarrhea ( TD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled efficacy safety study conduct patient travel develop region know high incidence TD . Eligibility base symptom complex highly indicative enteric acute bacterial infection without indication systemic infection . Approximately 262 patient enrol study randomize 3:1 ratio receive Rifamycin SV MMX® 400 mg placebo orally twice daily 3 day ( 72 hour ) . Treatment initiated day Screening ( Visit 1 , Day 1 ) , within 72 hour onset diarrhea . Daily dos study drug take breakfast time dinner time glass liquid . Safety efficacy assess . Blood sample routine safety test ( chemistry hematology ) collect Visit 1 Visit 3 send local laboratory analysis reporting Investigator safety monitoring . Urine sample routine urinalysis ( dipstick ) collect Visits 1 3 , result use Investigator safety monitoring . If patient 's diarrhea and/or sign symptom enteric infection worsen 24 hour interval time treatment period enteric illness fails improve 24 hour therapy , patient may receive Rescue Therapy . Rescue Therapy prescribe Investigator use local standard empiric therapy and/or guide pathogen identification .</detailed_description>
