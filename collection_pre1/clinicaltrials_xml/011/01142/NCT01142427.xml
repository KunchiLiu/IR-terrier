	<brief_title>Risk-Based Classification System Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To provide risk classification scheme patient newly diagnose acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , use assign treatment Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) frontline ALL treatment study . II . To capture classification data correlative study accompany current COG ALL treatment protocol . III . To provide central reference guide require research study conduct local reference laboratory newly diagnose ALL patient . IV . To provide mechanism optional banking leukemia germline specimens current future research . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood sample collection bone marrow biopsy baseline induction therapy immunophenotyping ALL confirmation classification , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ploidy , genomic variation , cytogenetic ( BCR-ABL , trisomies 4+10 , molecular test translocation ) analysis flow cytometry fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Immunophenotype result obtain study use determine patient 's assignment specific clinical-trial treatment . Some sample ( leukemic germline ) may bank current and/or future analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient newly diagnose acute leukemia : &gt; 25 % blast bone marrow ( BM ) aspirate If BM aspirate obtain diagnostic acute leukemia , diagnosis establish pathologic diagnosis acute leukemia BM biopsy A complete blood count ( CBC ) document presence least 1,000/uL circulate leukemic blast Adequate sample must provide reference and/or COGapproved cytogenetics laboratory allow completion study need riskstratification If BM aspirate perform , adequate material obtain , peripheral blood ( PB ) substitute BM least 1,000 circulate blasts/uL ( i.e. , white blood cell [ WBC ] count 10,000/uL 10 % blast WBC count 5,000/uL 20 % blast ) ; PB submit , please obtain send twice volume PB recommend BM volume specify ; patient remain AALL08B1 long required central laboratory test successfully perform ; long least 1,000/uL PB blast , institution encourage submit PB addition BM sample make sure adequate material available perform require study If adequate BM aspirate obtain few 1,000/uL PB blast , patient eligible AALL08B1 frontline COG ALL clinical trial ( NO exception rule ) Patient suspect ALL : Patients whose blast morphology obviously myeloid , whose blast myeloperoxidase positive , enrolled AALL08B1 ; however , patient true biphenotypic bilineage leukemia ( i.e. , patient present blast significant expression multiple lymphoid myeloid marker assignment single lineage possible ) eligible enroll AALL08B1 cell banking Samples must send COGapproved cytogenetics laboratory , COG Reference Laboratory study ; informative result need treatment stratification available specified timepoints induction , patient eligible receive postinduction therapy COG ALL trial All patient and/or parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent All institutional , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) requirement human study must meet Patient must receive prior cytotoxic therapy except steroid intrathecal chemotherapy Patient must secondary ALL develop treatment prior malignancy cytotoxic chemotherapy</criteria>
