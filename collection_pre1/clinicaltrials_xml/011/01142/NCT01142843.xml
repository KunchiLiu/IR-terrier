	<brief_title>Preliminary Evidence Efficacy Mouthwash Containing 5 % Propolis Control Plaque Gingivitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first reference mouthrinse formal practice credit Chinese medicine , 2700 B.C.E. , treatment disease gum ( Fischman , 1997 ) . The gram-positive gram-negative bacteria compose oral biofilms produce many metabolite induce gingival inflammation ( , gingivitis ) . Gingivitis lead periodontitis , condition gingival bone tissue destroy . The majority population may perform mechanical plaque removal sufficiently . Thus , antimicrobial mouthrinses improve daily home care may provide effective way remove control bacterial plaque limit gingivitis periodontitis ( Haffajee et al. , 2008 ) . The main indication either improvement dental health ( plaque gingivitis elimination particular ) prevention infection cause bacteria oral cavity specific situation , tooth extraction , intraoral surgical procedure immune suppression due cancer therapy transplantation . The use antimicrobial mouthrinses propose reduce level oral bacteria , specially Streptococcus mutans ( Kocak et al. , 2009 ) . In fact , show chemotherapeutic mouthrinses effective adjunct regular brushing flossing patient gingivitis , provide clinically significant benefit reduction plaque gingivitis ( Haffajee et al. , 2008 ) . Propolis resinous substance collect honeybee bud exudate certain tree plant , store inside hive . It use folk medicine ancient time treat various ailment ( Kunimasa et al. , 2009 ) . The action microorganisms essential characteristic propolis , human use century pharmaceutical property ( Kalogeropoulos et al. , 2009 ) . The antibacterial activity propolis report due flavonoid , aromatic acid ester present resin . Galangin , pinocebrin pinostrobin know flavonoid agent effective bacteria . Ferulic acid caffeic acid also contribute bactericidal action propolis ( Marcucci , 1995 ) . Thus , purpose study show preliminary evidence effect alcohol-free mouthwash contain 5 % green propolis control plaque gingivitis subject three month . Materials Methods Design study Product test This interventional study phase II three month , follow type , conduct Faculty Dentistry Federal University Minas Gerais , Brazil , August 2009 April 2010 . The alcohol-free mouthwash contain 5 % green propolis ( MGP 5 % ) use study handle accord request PharmaNéctar ® ( Belo Horizonte ) , within standard require ANVISA ( Brazil , 2000 ) within requirement ISO 9001 GMP International ( Table 1 ) . Participants Twenty five subject , age vary 18 60 year ( median age 35,92 ±9,7 ) , generally good health , pregnant breastfeeding , meet follow inclusion criterion , include study : minimum 20 sound , natural teeth ; mean plaque index ( PI ) ( Turesky modification Quigley-Hein Plaque Index , 1970 ) least 1.5 ; mean gingival index ( GI ) ( Talbott modification Gingival Index Löe-Silness , 1977 ) least 1.0 . Subjects orthodontic appliance removable prosthetics , tumor soft hard oral tissue , advance periodontal disease , receive antibiotic therapy 2 week start study present hipersensibility propolis exclude . Third molar teeth cervical restoration prosthetic crown include tooth count . The selection participant make convenience , base especially availability study , along study conduct . All subject read sign informed consent form start study . The protocol study approve local ethical review committee ( Committee Bioethics Research Federal University Minas Gerais ( COEP/UFMG - 0600/09 ) . Assessing mouthwash The examination baseline consist complete soft hard tissue examination perform register condition oral mucosa , change course study could identify , make assessment whether change could relate mouthrinse . The gingivitis mesiobuccal , midbuccal , distobuccal , mesiolingual , midlingual , distolingual , elegible teeth score use Talbott modification Gingival Index Löe-Silness - GI , 1977 , gum score four-point scale 0 ( absence inflammation ) 3 ( severe inflammation ) . The supragingival plaque mesiobuccal , midbuccal , distobuccal , mesiolingual , midlingual , distolingual , elegible teeth score use Turesky modification Quigley-Hein Plaque Index - PI , 1970 . Previously , disclose erythrosine 3 % solution , plaque score six point scale 0 ( plaque ) 5 ( plaque cover two-thirds tooth surface ) . Of mesiobuccal , midbuccal , distobuccal , mesiolingual , midlingual , distolingual , scorable teeth score use Turesky modification Quigley-Hein Plaque Index - PI , 1970 . There also evaluate Severity Plaque Index Severity Gingival Index ( Palomo et al. , 1989 ; Volpe et al.,1993 ) . These index measure rate surface high count plaque ( count similar 3 , 4 , 5 modification Quigley-Hein Plaque Index , 1970 ) high gingival index ( count similar 2,3 modification Gingival Index Löe-Silness , 1977 . These examination repeat 45 90 day use mouthrinse . After baseline examination , subject receive complete oral prophylaxis , include removal supragingival plaque calculus deposit . Soon , subject receive 5 % green propolis-containing mouthrinse alcohol-free ( MGP 5 % ) toothbrush . They instruct brush teeth usual rinse 10mL MGP 5 % , twice day , one minute , right meal morning night . Participants require use another mouthrinse throughout study . When new supply issue , subject return used material , compliance theproduct could monitor . Reproducibility clinical examination All examination conduct single examiner train optimize consistency study . Prior study , adviser train dental examiner , `` gold standard '' , direct introduce periodontal probe , gently , gingival sulcus , , keep instrument parallel long axis tooth , slide distal mesial delicately buccal lingual surface evaluate tooth . For calibration , examine nine subject include study . For plaque index perform theoretical calibration . Soon , photo use obtain standardization intra-examiner . The photo exhibit adviser examiner note value plaque index correspond picture . After 15 day , picture expose examiner noted value plaque index . Next , plaque index obtain first second time compare verify level intra-examiner . Then , obtain kappa value 0.73 , consider substantial estimate reliability ( Landis &amp; Koch , 1977 ) . Statistical Analysis The statistical package BioEstat version 4.0 use data analysis study . The average adjusted baseline score modify Plaque Index Quigley-Hein ( 1970 ) modify Gingival Index Löe-Silness ( 1977 ) correspond severity score , non-parametric distribution , compare covariance analysis , Friedman test data obtain 45 90 day study . All statistical test hypotheses two strand consider significance level p &lt; 0.05 ( Allen et al . 1998 ; Arweiler et al. , 2001 ) .</detailed_description>
