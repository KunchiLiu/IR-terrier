	<brief_summary>The Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Working Group ( CMSWG ) develop practical recommendation neurologist assess status subject disease modify drug ( DMDs ) decide may necessary modify treatment order optimize outcome . These recommendation base relapse , disease progression measure Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) EDSS progression , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) outcomes . The CMSWG agree compare post-treatment relapse rate severity baseline rate severity individual subject . The recommended minimum baseline reference time frame need assess relapse rate 2 year prior treatment initiation . The objective prospective relapse data ideally collect reference period . The CMSWG recommend follow take consideration assess relapse severity : effect relapse activity daily live ( ADL ) , type number system involve ( i.e. , relapse polysymptomatic affect cerebellar/motor system tend severe ) , whether course corticosteroid require . The CMSWG also recommend , prior consider treatment modification basis progression disability , progression confirm 6 month . The CMSWG 's Treatment Optimization Recommendations ( TORs ) retrospectively apply 4 year data set PRISMS study . Applying model subject first year therapy allow accurate prediction continue disease activity form relapse majority subject actually experience ongoing attack . The model less effective predict disability progression , may well due low number subject treatment progress study period . This observational study use TOR model identify subject either candidate therapy optimization candidate maintain current therapy . All subject follow prospectively re- assessment do model .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , inflammatory , demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) one common cause neurological disability young adult . The neuropathology disease mark accumulation leukocyte CNS , oligodendrocyte loss , demyelination , axonal atrophy , neuronal loss . Clinically characterize multi-focal recurrent attack neurological symptom sign variable recovery eventually , majority subject develop progressive clinical course MS . The exact cause MS unknown , although autoimmune process implicate . Genetic susceptibility play role disease initiation unidentified environmental factor may also involve . Three clinical form MS recognize : primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( PPMS ) , secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) RRMS . Primary progressive subject characterize slow steady accumulation neurological deficit onset without superimposed attack . Subjects RRMS exacerbation relapse subsequent variable recovery ( remission ) . Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis characterize steady accumulation significant persistent neurological deficit without superimposed relapse . In approximately 90 % subject , first presentation MS acute , usually reversible episode CNS dysfunction , refer Clinically Isolated Syndrome ( CIS ) . With advent MRI , become possible reasonably predict clinical course CIS subject present abnormal MRI finding . The first 5 year follow study CIS subject present abnormal MRI demonstrate trend lesion develop clinically definite MS ( CDMS ) frequently , 92 % 4-10 T2 lesion develop CDMS compare 67 % 2-3 T2 lesion . It also well establish vast majority CIS subject continue experience ongoing demyelinate disease activity , evidence MRI , even absence clinical conversion CDMS . The introduction disease modify drug ( DMDs ) MS significant impact management living disease . These DMDs first agents show alter natural course relapse MS . Although evidence DMDs significantly reduce disease activity , agent `` cure '' MS . Thus , many subject MS continue experience disease activity , spite treatment DMDs , include continued relapse , progressive impairment , ongoing accumulation MRI disease burden . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To assess application TOR influence clinician ' decision regard DMD treatment Canadian clinic set - To evaluate perceived utility TOR DMD treatment decision make process Canadian clinic set Secondary objective : - To determine proportion subject meet medium high level concern accord TOR Canadian Clinic setting . This non-interventional , open-label , observational , multicentric , phase IV study . Subjects assess accord TOR two occasion prospective 12 month observation period . All subject assess accord TOR baseline . Subjects subsequently assess accord TOR either time-point within 12-month period treatment modification consider reason intolerance end 12-month observational period . Treatment decision TOR assessment note , perception utility TOR decision make process capture . Additional feedback TOR collect end observational period separate evaluation questionnaire . The assessment carry baseline subsequent visit include EDSS history/current status , relapse history/current status , MRI history/current status , cognitive history/current status ( do ) neutralize antibody ( NAb ) history/current status ( do ) .</detailed_description>
