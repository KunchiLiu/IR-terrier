	<brief_title>The Patency Period New Plastic Anti-reflux Biliary Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bile duct related cancer condition quite commonly see among Asians . Predisposing condition primary bile duct cancer include recurrent infection autoimmune disease recurrent pyogenic cholangitis ( RPC ) primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) well congenital problem choledochal cyst . Peri-ampullary tumour , pancreatic tumour metastatic tumour bile duct compression cause bile duct obstruction . As many tumour discover late stage , curative treatment usually feasible . Palliative endoscopic stenting obstruct biliary system remain treatment choice majority . The main problem endoscopic stenting biliary system short stent patency period . There report modification plastic biliary stenting method recent year include change stent design , use different material coating , administrate prophylactic antibiotic use special drug . All fail show conclusive effect stent patency period . A preliminary study demonstrate promising result use stent anti-reflux property similar stent investigator use study .</detailed_description>
