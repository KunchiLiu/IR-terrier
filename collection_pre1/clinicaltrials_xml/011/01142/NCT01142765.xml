	<brief_summary>This study aim test safety efficacy six new malaria vaccine - AdCh63 AMA1 , MVA AMA1 , AdCh63 MSP1 , MVA MSP1 , AdCh63 ME-TRAP &amp; MVA ME-TRAP . These vaccine consist inactivated virus modify − reproduce ( replicate ) human , also include genetic material ( gene ) malaria protein express malaria parasite liver blood stage infection . The vaccine design stimulate immune response malaria protein ( immunogenicity describe nature magnitude immune response ) thus provide protection malaria infection . The protective efficacy vaccine evaluate challenge small number volunteer receive vaccine malaria infection bite infect mosquito ( sporozoite challenge ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy adult age 18 50 year Able willing ( Investigator 's opinion ) comply study requirement Willing allow investigator discuss volunteer 's medical history General Practitioner For female volunteer , willingness practice continuous effective contraception duration study . Agreement refrain blood donation course study Written inform consent History clinical P. falciparum malaria Travel malaria endemic region study period within precede six month risk malaria exposure . Participation another research study involve investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan use study period . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within three month precede plan administration vaccine candidate Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study Contraindication antimalarial drug ; Riamet &amp; chloroquine Concomitant use drug know cause QTinterval prolongation ( e.g . macrolides , quinolones , amiodarone etc ) History epilepsy History arrhythmia prolong QT interval . Family history sudden cardiac death . An estimate , ten year risk fatal cardiovascular disease ≥5 % , estimate Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE ) system 107 History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine e.g . egg product , Kathon . History clinically significant contact dermatitis Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 unit every week Suspected known inject drug abuse 5 year precede enrolment . Seropositive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) Seropositive hepatitis C virus ( antibody HCV ) Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test urinalysis Any significant disease , disorder finding may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data .</criteria>
