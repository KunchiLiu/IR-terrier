	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study give fulvestrant bortezomib together see well work compare fulvestrant alone treat postmenopausal woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Bortezomib may stop growth breast cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether fulvestrant effective without bortezomib treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant With Without Bortezomib Postmenopausal Women With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition bortezomib fulvestrant improve median progression free survival ( PFS ) compare fulvestrant alone postmenopausal woman estrogen receptor ( ER ) -positive locally advanced inoperable metastatic breast cancer disease resistant aromatase inhibitor therapy ( Arms A vs. B ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition bortezomib fulvestrant improve clinical benefit rate ( define objective response plus stable disease least 24 week day +1 ) . II . To determine percent patient , treat fulvestrant alone fulvestrant plus bortezomib , remain progression-free 24 week day +1 ( Arms A vs. B ) . III . To determine overall survival patient treat fulvestrant alone fulvestrant plus bortezomib ( Arms A , B , C ) . IV . To determine adverse event profile patient treat fulvestrant alone fulvestrant plus bortezomib ( Arms A , B , C ) . V. To determine clinical benefit rate 12 24 week fulvestrant plus bortezomib patient progress fulvestrant alone arm crossover receive combination ( Arm C ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform exploratory analysis effect bortezomib ( plus fulvestrant ) intratumoral nuclear/cytoplasmic ER ratio , unfold protein response ( BiP ) , apoptosis ( cleaved caspase 3 ) , B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /lymphoma 2 ( Bcl-2 ) phospho c-Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) patient tumor accessible biopsy consent optional post-treatment biopsy . II . To determine cyclin D1 expression pretreatment tumor specimen ( metastatic disease primary tumor former available ) predictive clinical benefit fulvestrant-bortezomib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( Arms A B ) . ARM A : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 ( day -14 , 1 , 15 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progressive disease may crossover arm C. ARM B : Patients receive fulvestrant arm A bortezomib intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 ( begin course 2 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C : Patients receive fulvestrant IM day 1 bortezomib IM day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
