	<brief_title>An Observational Study Document Effectiveness Compatibility Rebif 44 22 µg Therapy Chronic Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interferon beta-1a establish therapy first choice treatment chronic MS . The PRISMS study show therapy Rebif reduce frequency seriousness clinical attack episodes 4 year progress disability slow . This clinically identifiable effectiveness support significant decrease nuclear spin-tomographically provable disease activity total lesion stress . The interferon-beta therapy heal MS therapy Rebif however reduce number seriousness attack episodes clearly delay progress disability . The Rebif therapy long-term treatment , result subject may feel positive effect immediately , effect therapy noticed long period . At begin therapy , interferon-beta-specific side effect fever , fever-like symptom , muscle joint pain well reaction injection point occur . The described reaction individually dependent respective subject duration seriousness , however normally mild temporary . OBJECTIVE The objective study document effectiveness compatibility Rebif 44 22 µg proven clinical study therapy chronic MS practical condition large collection subject . Especially handle injection aid Rebiject II use Rebif pre-filled syringe document . The observation period study 3 month per subject approximately 500 subject clinically safe diagnosis chronic MS ability walk ( also aid ) record case series . Demographic data well detail diagnosis , course , current status previous therapy MS record begin case series . All data collect within framework therapy , e.g . blood count test determination liver function test value check possible influence Rebif parameter part case series hence document .</detailed_description>
