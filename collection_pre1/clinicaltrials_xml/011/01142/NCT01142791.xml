	<brief_summary>The objective Phase IV study evaluate safety ExAblate treatment uterine fibroid use enhanced sonication technique , base current commercially-approved treatment guideline . Treatment may include 100 % individual fibroid volume , within establish serosal sacral treatment margin . The Enhanced sonication one various sonication mode may lead increase thermal dose volume sonication without additional safety risk . This additional treatment tool available ExAblate system treatment uterine fibroid . The safety profile Enhanced Sonication investigate FDA-regulated IDE study . FDA grant approval Enhanced Sonication requirement perform post-approval study collect additional safety data treat 100 % individual fibroid volume .</brief_summary>
