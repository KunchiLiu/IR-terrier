	<brief_title>A Postmarketing Surveillance ( PMS ) Study Evaluate Extent Which Patient Compliance Influenced Use Variable Titration Regimen Start Treatment Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) With Interferon Beta 1a ( Rebif® )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interferon beta become treatment choice relapse MS . In previous clinical study , interferon-beta 1a ( Rebif ) use within scope PMS study demonstrate significant efficacy aspect treatment - magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data , relapse rate , progression disability . The PRISMS-4 study demonstrate treatment Rebif reduce frequency severity clinical relapse 4 year slow progression disability . In order achieve good subject compliance , important subject give realistic picture expect result treatment demand make connection treatment . Interferon beta cure MS , however treatment Rebif reduce number severity relapse delay progression disability . Rebif therapy long-term therapy . For reason , subject may feel positive effect immediately , instead may notice benefit treatment considerable period time . The early period start treatment consider crucial term whether treatment accept tolerated subject whether unplanned cessation treatment occur . OBJECTIVES The principal objective PMS study provide subject great possible degree safety support mean optimal management first week start treatment change different treatment regimen . This objective achieve , among thing , flexible dose escalation regimen take account individual subject ' acceptance . It precisely critical early phase treatment , mark uncertainty , change , case problem tolerability , poor subject compliance occurs , leading case treatment dropout . Another question address study relate small number subject initial phase could tolerate Rebif therapy high dosage ( 44 µg x3 ) . In case option temporary dose reduction low dosage ( 22 µg x3 ) . The objective dose reduction avoid unnecessary change treatment regimen thereby make important contribution improve compliance . In present PMS study , particular attention pay question subject compliance start Rebif therapy . This applied Rebif-naive subject subject switch Rebif receive form MS therapy .</detailed_description>
