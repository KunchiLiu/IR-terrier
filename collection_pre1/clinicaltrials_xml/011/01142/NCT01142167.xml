	<brief_title>A Comparison Ultra-thin Standard Colonoscope Achieving Caecal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy common endoscopic procedure , widely use investigation lower gastrointestinal tract diseases manifest alter bowel habit , per rectal bleed abdominal pain . It use diagnose colonic polyp , colorectal cancer inflammatory bowel disease name examples . Colorectal cancer screen show decrease colorectal cancer . Despite uptake general population suboptimal . A new prototype colonoscope Olympus additional distal bending section design . The investigator hypothesize performance characteristic similar standard colonoscope patient tolerability . This randomise control trial aim invite patient attend first outpatient colonoscopy able provide inform consent . ( prior experience ) ass completion rate , patient endoscopist satisfaction . Patients prior colorectal surgery previous colonoscopy exclude .</detailed_description>
