	<brief_summary>Levodopa-induced dyskinesia severely limit use levodopa Parkinson 's disease constitute debilitate complication dopaminergic treatment late stage . Among several neurobiological mechanism identify far , investigator establish experimental model key role D1 receptor hypersensitivity '' Ras-ERK '' signal pathway . As dopamine receptor machinery Ras-ERK pathway present blood lymphocyte , investigator wish test hypothesis level ERK phosphorylation lymphocytes biomarker levodopa-induced dyskinesia Parkinson 's Disease . The study perform dyskinetic levodopa-treated patient non-Parkinson 's Disease control . Blood sample `` '' `` '' levodopa treatment ( 1 hour post-dose ) , well clinical data collection do schedule pre-op work-up ( deep brain stimulation ) . Subsequently , suspend lymphocyte blood sample immunolabelled use anti-pERK antibody mean fluorescence intensity percent label lymphocyte assess flow cytometry . Additionally , plasma urine sample collect `` '' et `` '' dosage dopamine . The motor effect levodopa assess UPRSIII rating scale eye movement ( saccade ) speed non-invasive oculometric recording .</brief_summary>
