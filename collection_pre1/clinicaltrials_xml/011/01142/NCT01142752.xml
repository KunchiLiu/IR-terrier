	<brief_summary>The prevalence preterm birth decrease last decade despite improve health care . Intrauterine infection important etiology preterm birth interconnection systemic inflammation preterm birth clear . Mechanisms preterm birth assess preterm birth major risk factor morbidity mortality birth , thus important individual regard health cost . No intervention carry study . Hypotheses : 1 . There common etiology oral vaginal inflammation 2 . Bacterial specie similar vagina oral cavity 3 . There similar oral systemic immune reaction provoke preterm birth 4 . Inflammatory marker find pregnant woman risk get back normal post partum In matched case control study pregnant woman local , systemic oral inflammation marker bacterial load assess find interconnection body compartment allow explanation etiology preterm birth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vaginal , oral systemic inflammation preterm birth 1 . Summary The prevalence preterm birth ( PTB ) increase . While intrauterine infection may primary cause PTB , remote infection may also part aetiology risk gestational complication . Predicting identify woman risk deliver preterm difficult . Comprehensive study need study infectious inflammatory process may involve birth complication . Social , ethnic behavioural risk part factor involve . Thus , case-control study infection pregnancy must acknowledge control factor . The oral cavity provide unique study model periodontal infection inflammation . Gingivitis periodontitis associate elevate risk PTB . A large entity bacteria include aerobic anaerobic bacteria competent elicit systemic hyper-inflammatory host immune response identify periodontal infection . Inflammation gingival tissue increase pregnancy . Knowledge obtain study clinical parameter well study bacteria cytokine oral , vaginal blood sample pregnant woman risk preterm birth would establish evidence-based background successful clinical strategy prevent reduce risk PTB . The objective present match case-control study pregnant woman investigate local remote infection ( microbiological analysis culture , DNA-DNA checkerboard ) inflammation ( cytokine assay sample vaginal oral sample ) , routine clinical data three group pregnant woman : I . Women medically consider risk WITH actual preterm birth delivery II . Women medically consider risk preterm birth delivery deliver WITHOUT birth complication III . Women normal uneventful pregnancy ( control group ) The investigator aim test following hypothesis regard association oral infection PTB : I . There share infectious aetiology oral vaginal infection ( primary outcome ) II . In woman risk PTB vaginal oral bacterial microbiota similar III . There similar systemic and/or local inflammatory response ( haematogenous dissemination bacteraemia , feto-maternal immune response ) induce vaginal and/or oral infection , contribute PTB . IV . Elevated inflammatory marker find onset symptoms pregnant woman risk PTB normalize birth . 2 . Current status field research 2.1 . Introduction Preterm birth ( PTB ) define delivery 37 week gestation birth weight &lt; 2500 gram . PTB important determinant perinatal morbidity mortality . Among born 32 week gestation many child suffer lifelong sequelae prematurity range mild severe developmental disorder . 3 . Detailed Research Plan 3.1 . Scientific objective ( Aims ) The investigator aim test following hypothesis regard association oral infection PTB : I . There share infectious aetiology oral vaginal infection ( primary outcome ) II . In woman risk PTB vaginal oral bacterial microbiota similar III . There similar systemic and/or local inflammatory response ( haematogenous dissemination bacteraemia , feto-maternal immune response ) induce vaginal and/or oral infection , contribute PTB IV . Elevated inflammatory marker find onset symptoms pregnant woman risk PTB normalize birth 3.2 . Patient group The study design longitudinal , non-interventional case-control study pregnant woman include ( I ) control group woman uneventful pregnancy ( II ) group woman medically consider risk PTB actually deliver preterm ( III ) group woman medically consider risk PTB uneventful pregnancy . Subjects examine three time point ( I ) within 18-34 week pregnancy get symptomatic ( II ) within two day delivery ( III ) 4-6 week post-partum . This would allow investigator compare examined parameter within group define time frame . Due medical inclusion criterion clinical medical/dental examinators blind . At first examination clinician know whether subject belong group II group III . All laboratory process , however , perform knowledge group assignment . The investigator intend enrol total 180 pregnant woman clinically perceive risk PTB no/low risk base routine clinical assessment criterion . Consecutive consenting pregnant woman seek care , refer Frauenspital , University Berne ask participate admit prenatal care unit risk PTB , e.g . shorten cervical length , preterm contraction prelabor premature rupture membrane . The investigator anticipate 10 % dropout rate . They intend continuously match subject control group risk group . Consenting woman receive study examination well obstetric standard care pregnancy provide medical faculty investigator . Dental faculty investigator Department Periodontology , University Bern perform dental examination , data sample collection participate subject either Clinics Dental School Frauenspital bedridden pregnant woman . There specific dental intervention part study . The dentist normally provide care study subject continue . There currently know dental procedure reduce risk PTB . Dental procedures pregnancy consider low risk pregnant woman fetus . The investigator collect information medical dental treatment perform pregnancy . They assess obstetric dental clinical condition , use procedure follow clinic . The investigator also assess bacteria fungi vaginal oral compartment , serum local vaginal/oral inflammatory marker ( cytokine C-reactive protein ) . They recognize genetic socio-economic factor well ethnicity important factor risk PTB . The control group therefore pair matched gestational age , ethnicity , age , parity smoking . The investigator anticipate subject assign risk control group may actually deliver PTB . Only woman deliver uneventfully include control group .</detailed_description>
