	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy significant impact local control , disease free survival overall survival patient rectal cancer T2 , N1 , M0 T3-4 , N , M0 . Treatment accompanied side effect , mainly due inclusion small bowel urinary bladder treatment field . Two major modality pursue reduce volume small intestine urinary bladder treatment volume . One surgical procedure , absorbable mesh . These procedure fail implementation daily clinical practice . The second modality aim save small intestine urinary bladder toxicity radiotherapy modulate radiotherapy planning procedure . Using belly board change standard position supine prone could achieve aim ; part due gravitational displacement bowel . Several study evaluate impact position use belly board patient receive pelvis irradiation rectal cancer . The result inconclusive , prone position belly board appear promise . This study carefully evaluate impact patient 's position belly board dose volume histogram small bowel urinary bladder</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Patient Positioning Use Belly Board Small Bowel Urinary Bladder Volume Irradiated Patients Receiving Radiotherapy Rectal Cancer : A Prospective Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective non-randomized open study evaluate impact patient 's positioning use belly board rectal radiotherapy . In contrast previous study , clinical target volume organ risk contour three-dimensional planning . With aid modern imaging , correlation obtain dose volume ( DVH ) since parameter impact organ tolerance ionize radiation . Thirty patient rectal cancer schedule receive `` rectal radiotherapy '' , pre postoperative include ( 15 patient group ) . In addition radiotherapy , patient receive concomitant chemotherapy . Chemotherapy : The chemotherapy consist one following : 1 . Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) 825mg/m2 Ã—2/day , give every day radiotherapy . 2 . 5FU continuous infusion 180 mg/m2 , D1-5/week X 5 Radiotherapy : The clinical target volume ( CTV ) preoperative radiotherapy include entire rectum regional lymph node . The following lymph node contour : peri rectal , pre sacral , obturator , internal iliac distal common iliac . The contour rectum start 1 cm anal verge sigmoid ( average 15 cm ) . The planning target volume include CTV + 5mm The following organ risk contour : small intestine , urinary bladder femoral joint . The prescription dose : 180cGy/day , 5 time week total 5,040cGy ( 38b fraction 6 week . Each patient undergo two simulation , one supine position flat table another prone position belly board . No contrast medium use . The urinary bladder full attempt push small bowel away treatment volume . Three dimensional conformal radiotherapy plan do twice ( one position ) . Three four field plan evaluate position . Therefore comparison four plain optimal plan choose treatment.. The following parameter calculate : 1 . Total volume small bowel 2 . Total volume urinary bladder 3 . Intersection PTV Volume small bowel volume 4 . Intersection PTV volume urinary bladder volume 5 . Volume small bowel include treatment volume 6 . Volume urinary bladder treatment volume</detailed_description>
