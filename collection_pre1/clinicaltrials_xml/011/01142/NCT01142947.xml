	<detailed_description>Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) consider first-line therapy management control patient persistent asthma . Use inhale steroid associate reduced airway responsiveness , improve lung function , diminish symptom , few exacerbation . However study show considerable inter-subject variability ICS response 33 % 50 % patient demonstrate substantial improvement force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) follow therapy . It also estimate corticosteroid resistance account half asthma-related health care cost . Therefore understanding factor contribute corticosteroid resistance clinical economically important . African-American patient , particular , appear less likely respond corticosteroid therapy compare white patient . However , currently know whether difference result genetic environmental factor , whether difference exist inhaled steroid responsiveness ( i.e. , recommend route therapy ) . This question particular importance , since African-American patient suffer disproportionately asthma-related complication . To date study examine potential mechanism corticosteroid responsiveness , none address inhaled corticosteroid responsiveness , study design identify potentially causative genetic factor population-level . Therefore proposal first plan assess difference inhale corticosteroid responsiveness ( i.e. , improvement FEV1 ) African-American white patient asthma follow 6 week inhale beclomethasone dipropionate ( BD ) treatment . Second , seek identify genetic locus associate ICS responsiveness cohort treat BD 6 week . The diversity cohort distinct advantage , allow u use association analysis admixture map jointly identify locus associate steroid response . Next , take advantage ability ass ICS exposure clinical outcome longitudinally patient population ass pharmacogenomic interaction asthma exacerbation ( i.e. , asthma-related emergency department visit , asthma-related hospitalization , oral steroid burst ) group . Lastly , validate observe drug x gene interaction asthma exacerbation separate , large cohort patient asthma . This latter group also come screen asthma population comprise DNA clinical data ( i.e. , historic ICS exposure measure clinical outcome ) . Therefore , proposal plan identify set genetic polymorphism associate ICS responsiveness define improvement pulmonary function alteration exacerbation-related clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
