	<brief_summary>In course therapy escalation , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) subject high activity disease receive mainly mitoxantrone . The duration therapy limit cumulative dose life ( 140 mg/m^2 body surface area ) . In practice lower dose mitoxantrone ( 60-120 mg/m^2 body surface area ) use . The specific reason limited total dose potential cardiotoxic side effect mitoxantrone . Once cumulative dose mitoxantrone reach subject becomes stable , question subsequent therapy . A possibility time , so-called `` de-escalation '' , therefore reduce subject back immunomodulating basic treatment . The target open-label , randomise , multicentric , comparative , parallel-group study inquire systematically use course basic therapy Rebif 44 mcg thrice weekly ( tiw ) large number subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase IV Study Rebif Â® 44mcg Administered Three Times Per Week Subcutaneous Injection Compared With Treatment Therapy Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis After Mitoxantrone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis chronic , inflammatory , demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) one common cause neurological disability young adult . It characterise multi-focal recurrent attack neurological symptom sign variable recovery . Eventually , majority subject develop progressive clinical course . The exact cause MS unknown , although autoimmune process implicate . Genetic susceptibility play role disease initiation unidentified environmental factor may also involve . Three clinical form MS recognize : primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( PPMS ) , secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) relapse remit multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) . Primary progressive subject characterise slow steady accumulation neurological deficit onset without superimposed attack . Subjects RRMS exacerbation relapse subsequent variable recovery ( remission ) . Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis characterise steady accumulation significant persistent neurological deficit without superimposed relapse . Rebif [ recombinant interferon ( IFN ) beta-1a ] test series study MS subject dose range 22 mcg 132 mcg weekly dose frequency range weekly ( qw ) tiw . Rebif find well tolerated clinical pharmacology study , even high dos ( 66 mcg/m^2 ) . In late phase trial , Rebif test across broad range dos , vary duration , different stage MS disease . Dose test range 22 mcg 132 mcg weekly frequency administration qw tiw . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To asses treatment Rebif 44 mcg tiw compare subject treat 96 week maintain prolong clinical magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) stability previous treatment mitoxantrone Secondary objective : - To compare mean number T2 active lesion , define new enlarge T2 lesion , per subject per scan 96 week treatment Rebif 44 mcg three time per week subject treat - To assess safety efficacy Rebif 44 mcg This open-label , randomise , multicentric , comparative , parallel-group study neurologist blind treatment perform neurologic exam neuro-radiologist blind treatment assess central MRI scan . The study divide screen phase ( 28 day start IFN-beta-1a treatment ) , treatment phase 96 week well follow-up period 4 week subject ongoing serious adverse event ( SAEs ) week 96 . The study consist 2 group compare therapeutic effect high dose , high frequency IFN beta-1a therapy ( Rebif 44 mcg ) subject treat Rebif 44 mcg . Subjects group previously treat mitoxantrone &lt; 3 month prior study inclusion . Subjects assign treatment switch Rebif 44 mcg x 3 reach primary endpoint define stop criterion . The treatment period study begin completion baseline evaluation initiation study drug treatment Study Day 1 ( baseline visit ) continue completion treatment period Week 96 visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject give write informed consent . Subjects definite RRMS SPMS relapse Subjects EDSS 16 Subjects age 1860 year Subjects escalate mitoxantrone due high relapse activity MRI activity ( due EDSS progression exclusively ) Subjects may confirm 1 point EDSS progression ( 0.5 point EDSS &gt; 5.5 ) within last 9 month Subjects free relapse last 6 month Subjects last mitoxantrone treatment 1 6 month prior screen Subjects treat mitoxantrone minimum 9 month maximum 36 month , total cumulative dose 40120 mg/m^2 Female subject must neither pregnant breastfeeding must lack childbearing potential , define either : 1 . Being postmenopausal surgically sterile , 2 . Using hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide condom spermicide duration study . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum urinary human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test within 7 day prior start study treatment . A pregnancy test require subject post menopausal surgically sterile . Subject receive cytokine anticytokine therapy within 3 month prior study Day 1 Subject escalate mitoxantrone due EDSS progression Subject ongoing MS relapse Subject PPMS Subject SPMS without superimpose relapse Subject receive immunomodulatory treatment IFNbeta glatiramer acetate mitoxantrone Subject previously receive total lymphoid irradiation Subject receive oral systemic corticosteroid adrenocorticotrophic hormone ACTH within 30 day study Day 1 Subject receive intravenous immunoglobulin underwent plasmapheresis within 6 month prior study day 1 Subject receive immunomodulatory immunosuppressive therapy ( include limit cyclophosphamide , cyclosporin , methotrexate , azathioprine , linomide , teriflunomide , natalizumab , laquinimod , Campath ) within 12 month prior study Day 1 Subject require chronic monthly pulse corticosteroid study Subject receive investigational drug experimental procedure within 12 month study Day 1 Subject inadequate liver function , define total bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase great 2.5 time upper limit normal value . Subject inadequate bone marrow reserve , define white blood cell count le 0.5 time low limit normal Subject suffers current autoimmune disease Subject know allergy IFN excipient ( ) Subject suffers major medical psychiatric illness opinion investigator create undue risk subject could affect compliance study protocol Subject treat drug IFNbeta glatiramer acetate within 2 year mitoxantrone Subject know cardiac systemic disease Subjects pregnant .</criteria>
