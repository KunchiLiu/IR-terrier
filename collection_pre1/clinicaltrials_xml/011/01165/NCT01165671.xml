	<brief_summary>Treatment standard patient primary glioblastoma ( GBM ) combine radiochemotherapy temozolomide ( TMZ ) . Radiation deliver total dose 60 Gy use photon . Using treatment regimen , overall survival could extend significantly however , median overall survival still 15 month . Carbon ion offer physical biological advantage . Due invert dose profile high local dose deposition within Bragg peak precise dose application spar normal tissue possible . Moreover , comparison photon , carbon ion offer increase relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) , calculate 2 5 depend GBM cell line well endpoint analyze . Protons , however , offer RBE comparable photon . First Japanese Data evaluation carbon ion radiation therapy show promising result small heterogeneous patient collective . In current Phase II-CLEOPATRA-Study carbon ion boost compare proton boost apply macroscopic tumor surgery primary diagnosis patient GBM apply standard radiochemotherapy TMZ 50 Gy . In experimental arm , carbon ion boost apply macroscopic tumor total dose 18 Gy E 6 fraction single dose 3 Gy E. In standard arm , proton boost apply total dose 10 Gy E 5 single fraction 2 Gy E. Primary endpoint overall survival , secondary objective progression-free survival , toxicity safety .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design The purpose trial compare carbon ion boost proton boost deliver macroscopic tumor combination combine radiochemotherapy TMZ patient primary GBM . The aim study compare overall survival primary endpoint , progression free survival , toxicity safety secondary endpoint . Focus analysis evaluate change overall survival local control carbon ion radiotherapy . Therefore , aim trial evaluate improvement outcome due effect alter biology carbon ion GBM . Chemotherapy TMZ consider standard treatment administer continuously would apply standard patient care outside trial . Trial Design The trial perform single-center two-armed randomize Phase II study . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion randomize two arm : Arm A - Experimental Arm Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy Boost macroscopic tumor Total Dose 18 Gy E , 6 fraction , 3 Gy E single dose Arm B - Standard Arm Proton Radiation Therapy Boost macroscopic tumor Total Dose 10 Gy E , 5 fraction , 2 Gy E single dose Standard chemotherapy TMZ continue experimental standard arm conventional dose 75 mg/m2 per day .</detailed_description>
