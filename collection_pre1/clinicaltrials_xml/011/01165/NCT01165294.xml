	<brief_summary>The objective study develop exploratory design future Proof-of-Concept trial reliably accurately measure central nervous system ( CNS ) effect potentially new drug oppose effect ketamine subanesthetic dose level give healthy volunteer . A functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) electroencephalogram ( EEG ) perform simultaneously ketamine challenge register effect trigger Ketamine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Ketamine Attentiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign drug ) , placebo-controlled , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , 2 way crossover ketamine challenge study ( participant may receive different intervention sequentially trial ) 24 healthy male volunteer . For participant , study consist eligibility screen examination , two 2-day treatment period , separate least 1 week , follow-up examination 7 day last dose administration . The maximal study participation volunteer around 6 week . Apart observe possible neural vascular ketamine effect , cerebral ketamine effect investigate simultaneously perform fMRI/EEG ketamine administration . These investigation do volunteer rest well cognitive testing ( visual oddball task ) . Safety evaluation include continuous monitoring vital sign oxygen saturation . Due pharmacokinetic property ketamine assessment start intravenous ketamine bolus ( drug give directly vein short period time ) follow 1 minute break . During assessment continuous intravenous ( minimal ) drug administration . Before assessment start intravenous bolus 0.1 mg/kg ketamine 5 minute time follow 1 minute break continuous infusion start 0.015625 mg/kg/min ketamine . Since plasma level elevate infusion administer dose lower 10 % every 10 minute .</detailed_description>
