Subjects born 1985 late subject bear 1985 tropical region must history Varicella Zoster virus ( VZV ) infection serological evidence prior VZV infection ; Written inform consent obtain subject ; Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study ; Nonchildbearing potential define current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . OR Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject practice adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series ; Known human immunodeficiency virus1 ( HIV1 ) infect , diagnose least 1 year prior enrolment ; For antiretroviral therapyART High CD4 ART Low CD4 cohort : Stable ART least one year CD4 T cell count &gt; = 50 cell /mm3 screen Undetectable VL screening ; For nonART High CD4 cohort : ARTnaïve subject never receive antiretroviral therapy HIV diagnosis commencement ART expect base current assessment within next seven month ; HIV VL &gt; = 1000 copies/mL &lt; = 100 000 copies/mL screen CD4 T cell count &gt; = 500 cells/mm3 screening . Use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine , plan use study period ; Vaccination varicella herpes zoster ( HZ ) within previous 12 month ; Occurrence varicella HZ episode within previous 12 month ; History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine . Additionally , consider allergic reaction material equipment relate study participation . Please note , vaccine vial study contain latex ; Has currently Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) define condition ; Opportunistic infection AIDSassociated malignancy previous year ; Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition result disease HIV infection immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy ; Administration immunoglobulins , and/or blood product within 90 day precede first dose study vaccine/placebo plan administration study period ; Chronic administration immunosuppressive immunemodifying drug within 6 month prior first vaccine dose ; Administration and/or plan administration vaccine foreseen study protocol within 30 day dose 1 , dose 2 and/or 3 vaccine and/or within 30 day dose . However , license nonreplicating vaccine may administer 8 day prior dose 1 , 2 and/or 3 , and/or least 14 day dose study vaccine ; Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational product ; Acute disease time enrolment ; Any contraindication receive intramuscular injection ; Any condition illness might interfere evaluation safety immunogenicity vaccine ; Active hepatitis B ( HBV ) infection active hepatitis C ( HCV ) infection . Current use HIV fusion inhibitor , chemokine ( CC motif ) receptor ( CCR5 ) inhibitor Interleukin2/ Interleukin7/ Interferon ; For subject ART cohort , change antiretroviral drug regimen within 12 week prior vaccination ; Pregnant lactate female ; Female planning become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution ; Abnormal biochemical hematological laboratory value obtain blood sample collect screening .</criteria>
