	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose bendamustine hydrochloride give together carboplatin , etoposide , rituximab treat patient diffuse large B cell lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma come back period improvement respond previous treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , etoposide , carboplatin , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may block cancer growth target certain cell . Giving bendamustine hydrochloride together carboplatin , etoposide , rituximab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximally tolerate dose bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) combine rituximab , carboplatin , etoposide chemotherapy patient relapse refractory lymphoid malignancy . II . To determine safety toxicity regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To gain preliminary assessment efficacy regimen . II . To determine ability proceed peripheral blood stem cell collection follow regimen ( impact regimen stem cell reserve ) . III . To investigate whether finding laboratory , radiographic pathologic study prognostic impact response treatment . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study bendamustine hydrochloride follow phase II study . Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 2 , etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-3 , carboplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Patients cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20+ T-cell lymphoma disease also receive rituximab IV day 2 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
