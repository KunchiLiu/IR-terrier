	<detailed_description>1 . Research aim The increase prevalence severe aortic valve defect corollary increase life expectancy ( Lindroos et al . 1993 ) . For many year , surgical valve replacement extracorporeal circulation gold standard treatment severe aortic valve disease . Every year , 12,000 patient Germany receive isolate aortic valve surgery ( Gummert et al . 2009 ) . Several alternative establish procedure recently emerge : - V-TAVI , vascular transcatheter aortic valve implantation - A-TAVI , apical transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( Cribier et al . 2002 , Walther et al . 2008 , Webb et al . 2007 , Himbert et al . 2008 , Walther et al . 2007 ) . For time , percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty ( Sack et al . 2008 ) use palliative measure specific patient . New development trigger assumption come year certain reorientation treatment patient aortic valve defect . In position paper publish jointly German Cardiac Society ( DGK ) German Society Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery ( DGTHG ) , consensus new technique use patient either contraindication conventional surgery high risk preoperative mortality , e.g . due severe comorbidities ( Figulla et al . 2009 ) . As yet limited experience field neither randomised trial long-term-results available , use new implantation technique therefore recommend young patient patient without comorbidities ( Figulla et al . 2009 ) . There accordingly urgent need introduction innovative medical procedure stringently monitor accord scientific principle . The goal plan Germany Aortic Valve Register evaluate new treatment point view benefit und risk respect gold standard conventional surgery , view compile evidence-based indication criterion . The register furthermore allow first time comparison various operative procedure , Ross procedure , David procedure various mechanical biological aortic valve implant . 2 . Rationale study design Randomised trial control environment consider best scientific practice verify efficacy new method . The disadvantage small part potential patient include trial , result therefore reflect small section real world . Furthermore , randomise study design ethical reason acceptable approach question , especially contraindication exist certain branch treatment spectrum treatment expand . Nevertheless , new procedure critically scientifically analysed risk-benefit ratio accurately determine . National heath authority therefore request register data addition control trial order verify safety efficacy new procedure across large patient population . 3 . Objectives 1 . Description structure , process outcome quality various technique aortic valve therapy 2 . Definition indication criterion ( e.g . score system ) 3 . Collection information quality safety special medical device 4 . Evaluation quality care level participate centre view increase quality 5 . Health economic evaluation apply treatment 4 . Study design Prospective , control , multicenter register study 5 . Inclusion criterion All consecutive patient participate hospital aortic valve defect receive one follow therapy : 1. surgical aortic valve replacement , 2. aortic valve surgery ( Ross procedure , David procedure ) 3. percutaneous transvascular ( retrograde ) aortic valve implantation 4. percutaneous transapical aortic valve implantation 5. aortic valve valvuloplasty 6 . Variables measurement • Clinical short term long term result ( event free survival ) 30 day , one year 3 5 year • Indication various procedure • Documentation surgical risk quality life - Documentation technical performance success intervention , include re-interventions - Documentation in-hospital mortality non-fatal severe complication - Documentation medication discharge / long-term medication - Documentation implant use - Documentation length stay hospital rehabilitation - Documentation mortality non-fatal severe complication , re-intervention , re-hospitalisation , well medication within 30 day , one year 3 5 year . 7 . Statistical method / evaluation plan All collect parameter analyse descriptively entire study population include therapy ( see : 5 . Inclusion criterion ) . The absolute value percentage quality data report . For continuous variable median quantity present . Event free survival visualise Kaplan-Meier graph . The descriptive analysis main measurement variable help illustrate quality various technique aortic valve replacement structure , process outcome point view ( objective a. ) . Within different type therapy , predictor surgery/intervention without complication , therefore also mortality , well improvement quality life ascertain regression model . The result calculation use detect criterion indicate various technique ( objective b. ) . Within various technique , alternative medical device compare respect mortality quality life . Propensity-score model use adjustment purpose ( objective c. ) . All participate centre receive benchmark report year patient respective centre compare hospital . The report distinguish various technique aortic valve replacement . In addition descriptive comparison , complication report risk-adjusted centre analyse point view centre-related effect ( objective d. ) . An adjusted comparison different type therapy respect complication , cost patient ' quality life statistical method undertaken patient population various technique overlap least partially regard predictor complication , cost quality life . This examine development first report . The follow data need evaluation health-economy point view ( objective e. ) : Demographical data , detail regard intervention , complication context intervention , clinical outcome parameter , quality life ( basis standardise questionnaire ) , medication , consult general practitioner specialist , hospitalisation , rehabilitation measure , dependence long term care ( care level ) , employment well inability work reduction earn capacity . A price consumption resource determine data collect . This allow monetary value put consumption resource calculation incur expense . It may context necessary incorporate time factor consumption form country-specific sector-specific inflation adjustment cost relation base year . This provide possibility analyse cost regard choose procedure ( see : 5 . Inclusion criterion ) . It furthermore plan run cost-effectiveness-analysis close cooperation clinical expert , cost procedure set clinical effect achieve cost-effectiveness relation ( ICER ) . Additionally , cost-utility analysis conduct wherever possible . The cost various treatment thereby set relation so-called quality adjust life year ( QALYs ) , combine endpoint consist quality life length life . The survey quality life structure questionnaire allow quality life present index . The goal accompany health economic research therefore provide comparison monitor therapy alternative point view clinical economic effectiveness . It emphasise differentiated approach must take comparison individual group due absence randomisation . Matching undertaken minimise selection bias . Due particularly high difference patient collective , question whether possible apply method anticipate data conclusively answer data record receive . 8 . Data model The register provide complete survey . The data model base three data source . 1 . Data set external performance measurement accord German Social Code ( § 137 SGB V ) : The set provide data pre- , intra- postoperative process hospitalisation time surgery . 2 . Register data set : Additional internet-based survey , e.g . specific indication criterion indication use medical device 3 . Follow-up : Survey follow-up 30 day , 1 , 3 5 year registry centre . The complete data collection base consent patient hospital perform surgical catheter support aortic valve procedure . From point view data protection regulation , safe feasible way obtain longitudinal data . The completeness data collection test electronic tool analyse reimbursement data . Monitoring data validity carry multi-stage plausibility check data crosscheck randomly select sample ( audit ) . 9 . Period data collection The phase patient-recruiting start 5 July 2010 end decide Executive Board . Follow-ups take place 30 day , 1 year , 3 5 year aortic valve procedure . Efforts make achieve central follow-up , conduct write consent patient obtain hospital agree export data registry centre . 10 . Data management The address patient need follow-up via telephone keep separately medical data patient . Only person charge telephone follow-up access address patient . Only anonymised medical patient data use statistical analysis . Personal data anonymised immediately database close delete last scientific analysis . For data transmission quality assurance data accord § 137 Social Code book five register , tool make available participating centre . For purpose , participate centre conduct `` internal BQS-export '' . The file generate internal-BQS-export include identification characteristic combination data set accord § 137 Social Code book five e-sheet data-sets possible . This ensure data receive write consent patient transmit register . 11 . Benchmark report During period routine operation register participate hospital receive benchmark report least year . The report conduct individually hospital compare data respective hospital data hospital . The collect data analyse respect characteristic , therapy clinical progress patient include . This benchmark system enable internal quality assurance participate hospital . 12 . Supporting organisation fund The register support Executive Board consist member two association involve various expert without vote right . All member disclose possible conflict interest . The Executive Board also support Steering Committee , consultancy role representative industrials sponsor , insurance company , health economic expert representative political decision-making-bodies invite . The support organisation register non-profit GmbH Deutsches Aortenklappenregister ( GARY ) , official holder data legal point view . 13 . Independence Register A funding agreement manufacturer medical device ensure full independence Executive Board . A disclosure stipulation guarantee evaluation publication conduct solely accord scientific criterion . This prevent manipulative influence publication withhold publication . The involved society BQS Institute virtue statutes autonomous body professional scientific point view .</detailed_description>
