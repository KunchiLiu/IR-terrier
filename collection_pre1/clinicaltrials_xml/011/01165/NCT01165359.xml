	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety ITX 5061 Treatment-Naive Hepatitis C ( HCV ) -Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HCV serious health concern lead cirrhosis , liver cancer , liver failure . Currently , HCV treat pegylated interferon ribavirin , medication always effective may harmful side effect . ITX 5061 new medication develop treat HCV . This study take place three partsâ€”Parts A , B , C. Each part study enroll participant different period time , within part study , participant receive vary amount ITX 5061 . If ITX 5061 find unsafe part study , subsequent part study occur . The purpose study evaluate safety different dos ITX 5061 determine amount time need ITX 5061 safely low amount HCV blood . This study enroll people HCV HIV-uninfected . Participants enroll one three part study . They randomly assign receive ITX 5061 placebo day 3 day Part A , 14 day Part B , 28 day Part C. Within Parts A , B , C , participant receive either 150 mg , 75 , mg , 25 mg ITX 5061 . At baseline study visit , participant physical exam blood urine collection . All participant receive assign medication visit . Participants Part A return study visit 2 day baseline visit . During study visit , participant undergo physical exam blood collect several time 8-hour period . Participants Part B study attend study visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 13 day baseline visit . Participants Part C study attend study visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 21 , 27 day baseline visit . Participants Parts B C undergo similar study procedure participant Part A . Throughout study , participant record medication usage diary . All participant attend study visit day receive last medication dose . In addition , participant Part A attend study visit 9 16 day baseline visit , participant Part B attend study visit 20 27 day baseline visit , participant Part C attend study visit 34 41 day baseline visit . At follow-up visit , participant physical exam blood urine collection .</detailed_description>
