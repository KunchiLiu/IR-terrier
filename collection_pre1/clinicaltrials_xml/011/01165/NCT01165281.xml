	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study JNS024 Extended Release ( ER ) Japanese Korean Patients With Chronic Malignant Tumor-Related Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient study staff know identity study drug assign patient ) , multicenter study evaluate safety efficacy orally ( mouth ) administer R331333 ( refer JNS024 extend release [ ER ] capsule CG5503 ) dosages 25 mg 200 mg twice daily compare orally administer capsule oxycodone control release ( CR ) dosages 5 mg 40 mg twice daily 4 week Japanese Korean patient moderate severe chronic malignant tumor-related cancer pain require around-the-clock opioid therapy ( treatment narcotic analgesic pain reliever ) dissatisfy pain relief experience current treatment . The active control , oxycodone CR , use study opioid analgesic approve treatment moderate severe pain . Approximately 212 Japanese patient approximately 100 Korean patient meet screen criterion study enrol study enter titration period study receive start dosage either JNS024 ER 25 mg twice daily oxycodone CR 5 mg twice daily . The dose study drug patient titrate ( increase ) optimal dose sufficient analgesia ( pain relief ) achieve ( ie , maximum dose JNS024 ER 200 mg twice daily Oxycodone CR 40 mg twice daily ) . When dosage study drug increase , safety confirm study visit telephone day dose increase . Once optimal dose study drug determine , patient continue receive dose maintenance period study . Patients participate study total approximately 6 week ; time patient receive study drug 4 week ( titration maintenance period combine ) . During study , patient experience breakthrough pain ( pain occur short period time dose study drug ) , treatment rescue medication ( morphine immediate release [ IR ] 5 mg ) give . In addition , patient allow continue take stable dos non-opioid analgesic ( non-narcotic pain medication mild moderate pain ) taking time study entry may reduce dosage discontinue use study . During study , blood sample collect patient protocol-specified time point determine concentration study drug administration . The safety patient monitor study evaluate adverse event finding clinical laboratory test , physical examination , vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) measurement report . The primary outcome measure study change baseline last 3 day study drug administration average pain intensity score use 11 point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) . Patients receive R331333 ( refer JNS024 ER CG5503 ) mouth without food start dose 25 mg twice daily increase necessary maximum dose 200 mg twice daily total 4 week ( titration maintenance period combine ) OR double-blind oxycodone CR mouth without food start dose 5 mg twice daily increase necessary maximum dose 40 mg twice daily total 4 week .</detailed_description>
