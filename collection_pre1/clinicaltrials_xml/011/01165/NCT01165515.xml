	<brief_summary>Endostatin , 20-kDa cleavage product collagen XVIII , component extracellular matrix express basement membrane . As potent inhibitor angiogenesis , endostatin induces endothelial cell apoptosis diminishes cell migration , adhesion proliferation . Endostatin may stop progression atherosclerosis . Atherosclerotic heart disease involve unwanted tissue growth . By cut blood supply plaque likelihood plaque rupture may eventually reduce . Recent data indicate loss collagen XVIII/endostatin related enhancement neo-vascularization vascular permeability atherosclerosis . Plaque neo-vascularization strongly correlate regional content inflammatory cell . Furthermore , increase vascular permeability enhances lipid accumulation vessel wall , hence increase foam cell . Therapeutic angiogenesis promise strategy treatment myocardial infarction . However , remain unknown endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor , endostatin , regulate angiogenesis myocardial infarction . Rat model show myocardial infarction endostatin neutralization display adverse leave ventricular remodel severe heart failure compare control . Although angiogenesis increase , tissue remodel interstitial fibrosis exaggerate post-myocardial infarction heart endostatin neutralization . However , several study suggest endostatin may locally modulate coronary collateral formation inhibit collateral vessel formation patient ischemic heart disease . During treadmill exercise test healthy volunteer significant increase circulate endostatin level observe . Exercise induces angiogenesis cardiac skeletal muscle decrease endostatin muscle tissue increase blood flow metabolically active tissue . Thereby endostatin release general circulation . In summary , endostatin might new weapon fight atherosclerotic progression inhibit neo-vascularization atherosclerotic plaque .</brief_summary>
