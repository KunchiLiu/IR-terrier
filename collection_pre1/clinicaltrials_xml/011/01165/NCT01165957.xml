	<detailed_description>Polyethylene wear major factor limit longevity total knee arthroplasty . Evaluation volumetric wear explanted polyethylene tibial insert provide valuable insight performance different design . Current technologies available measure volumetric wear tibial insert include gravimetric technique , coordinate measuring machine ( CMM ) , laser-scanning , micro-CT . In study , employ micro-CT determine volumetric wear allow u obtain high-resolution three-dimensional image entire insert volume , include surface well interior insert . The micro-CT image use reconstruct entire three-dimensional geometry insert ( include subsurface void ) use image analysis software partition reconstruct insert discrete region ( i.e . medial/lateral articulate surface , backside , post ) , allow u determine various region contribute total implant wear . By subdivide insert discrete region , analysis technique also enable u account material remove insert explantation evaluate implant wear . By compare retrieve insert unworn control use three-dimensional image analysis software , also quantify plastic deformation measuring volume material deform outside confines control insert . Additionally , inspection shape difference wear unworn specimen enable u distinguish implant wear , plastic deformation volume difference associate manufacturing tolerance . Although partial voluming effect make edge detection challenging , high resolution micro-CT image tend minimize effect use gravimetric measurement determine insert-specific Hounsfield threshold use define image volume specimen . We subsequently validate accuracy reconstruct insert volume derive micro-CT image compare linear measurement actual specimen several discrete location . The use micro-CT scan evaluate vivo volumetric wear associate different design enable accurate measurement volumetric polyethylene loss different region insert . This information provide good understanding clinical outcome associate different design strategy provide data guide future development effort . We hypothesize fixed bearing insert , polyethylene lock metal baseplate , demonstrate volumetric wear mobile bearing insert design slide rotate metal baseplate . Articular side wear measure register micro-CT image retrieve control insert unworn portion articular surface use Analyze image analysis software ( Mayo Biomedical Imaging Resource , Rochester , MN ) . Differences volume among retrieved unworn control insert evaluate account plastic deformation may occur vivo . Volumetric wear entire insert subregions calculate subtracting volume plastic deformation ( correspond region retrieve insert outside boundary control insert ) volume material lose within confines original insert geometry . We compare wear among mobile fix bearing use Independent Sample t-test Mann-Whitney U , depend distribution data . We also use multiple linear regression analysis examine relationship insert wear variable , include time vivo , terminal sterilization technique insert patient-related factor gender , age , body mass index ( BMI ) .</detailed_description>
