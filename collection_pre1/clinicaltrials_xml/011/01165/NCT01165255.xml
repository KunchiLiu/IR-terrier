	<brief_summary>The study extension earlier work base retrospective epidemiologic study infant born woman expose bupropion estimate first trim pregnancy use data large US health plan affiliate i3 Drug Safety ( Clinical study ID WWE113694 ) ( Cole JA , Oh KS , Chiang CC , Walker AM , Haight BR , Modell JG . Bupropion pregnancy prevalence congenital malformation Pharmacoepidemiology Drug Safety , 2007 ; 16 : 474-484 ) . The cohort develop early work consist infant born woman expose bupropion estimate first trimester outside first trimester , random sample infant born woman expose antidepressant first trimester 01 January 1995 30 September 2004 . The objective study include refine original first trimester bupropion cohort original bupropion outside first trim cohort mono-therapy mono- poly-therapy . Exposure antidepressant first trimester also refine mono-therapy mono- poly-therapy . With input pediatric cardiology expert , list specific cardiovascular malformation malformation grouping create . The grouping create among refine first trim bupropion cohort well two comparison cohort bupropion outside first trimester first trimester antidepressant use ( mono-therapy mono-or poly-therapy ) . The prevalence cohort calculate number infant specific cardiovascular malformation divide number live born infant . Prevalence report per 1,000 infant . Confidence interval calculate use Wilson 's approximation exact binomial interval number case five great exact binomial interval number case fewer five . The appropriateness calculation evaluate . Where number permit , adjust odds ratio specific cardiovascular groups/malformations calculate appropriate , stratify accord maternal dispensing medication suspect teratogenic . The following comparison , number permit , perform : 1 ) bupropion first trimester mono-therapy cohort versus antidepressant first trimester mono-therapy cohort ; 2 ) bupropion first trim mono- poly-therapy cohort versus antidepressant first trim mono- poly-therapy cohort ; 3 ) bupropion first trimester mono-therapy cohort versus bupropion outside first trim mono-therapy cohort , 4 ) bupropion first trim mono- poly-therapy cohort versus bupropion outside first trim mono- poly-therapy cohort . Adjusted odds ratio calculate generalized estimate equation form multivariate logistic regression account birth associate multiple infant . The covariates identify original study include re-analysis . Covariates include : diagnosis bipolar disorder eclampsia within one year delivery ; dispensings lithium , phenytoin , fluconazole within one year delivery end first trimester ; number physician visit within 10 12 month delivery , maternal age , geographic region health plan , infant gender . If generalize estimate equation form logistic regression model converge , adjust odds ratio present conventional multivariate logistic model . If conventional multivariate logistic model converge , crude odds ratio present .</brief_summary>
