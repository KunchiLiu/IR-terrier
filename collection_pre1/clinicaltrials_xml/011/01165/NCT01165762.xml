	<brief_title>Combined Blood Stem Cell Kidney Transplant One Haplotype Match Living Donor Pairs .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study recipient live related kidney transplant one HLA haplotype withdrawn immunosuppressive medication become `` tolerant `` kidney graft . The recipient receive condition regimen compose low dose radiation lymphoid tissue ( total lymphoid irradiation , TLI ) anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) time transplant . They infuse purify `` stem cell '' T-cell kidney donor 2 week transplant try achieve mixed chimerism white blood cell donor ( recipient would mixture blood cell donor blood ) . The kidney donor provide peripheral stem cell 6-8 week kidney donation . It outpatient procedure do use peripheral vein treatment G-CSF ( filgrastim ) .Immunosuppressive medication decrease gradually possibly stop 1 1/2 year transplantation recipient meet withdraw criterion ( persistence mix chimerism 18 month , episode rejection rejection surveillance kidney biopsy ) . Potential candidate need approve kidney transplant available close follow-up Stanford University Medical Center .</detailed_description>
