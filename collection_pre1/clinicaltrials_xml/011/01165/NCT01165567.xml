	<brief_summary>Background : Contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) serious clinical problem associate increase morbidity mortality , particularly patient chronic renal insufficiency . Although agent include hydration saline prescribe prevent renal deterioration high risk patient , efficacy clear define debatable . Therefore additional prophylactic pretreatments need . Methods/Design : Present study aim investigate difference occurrence CIN sarpogrelate premedication patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . 268 participant , age 20-85 year clinical diagnosis CKD recruit . They randomly allocate one two condition : ( ) routine treatment without sarpogrelate group ( ii ) routine treatment sarpogrelate ( fixed-flexible dose 300 mg/day ) . The primary outcome occurrence CIN 4 week receive contrast agent . Discussion : As May 2010 , register trial evaluate therapeutic potential sarpogrelate prevent CIN . If sarpogrelate decrease worsen renal function occurrence CIN , provide safe , easy inexpensive treatment option .</brief_summary>
