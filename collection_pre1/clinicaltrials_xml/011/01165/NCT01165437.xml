	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) highly prevalent medical condition . Patients PAD usually diagnose basis ankle-brachial index . The ankle-brachial index ratio ankle pressure arm pressure measurement blood pressure arm legs use Doppler device . The need dedicate equipment train personnel , along time require perform test , identify barrier widespread implementation ankle-brachial index screening . The use automate oscillometric device blood pressure measurement apply leg pressure measurement determination ankle-brachial index variable success . It beneficial investigate reliable oscillometric-based procedure accurately measure leg pressure ankle-brachial index across entire spectrum PAD severity . In previous pilot study complete 2009 ( IRB 08-823 ) , investigator gather data N=60 subject allow mathematical analysis oscillometric waveform derive low extremity compare Doppler-based measurement blood pressure . We use signal processing analysis regression technique develop two-step algorithm allow accurate interpretation oscillometric waveform normal/mild vs. moderate/severely diseased limb accurate calculation ankle pressure across spectrum peripheral artery disease severity . This propose project validate novel oscillometric ABI algorithm population patient identify risk PAD screen ABI recommend multiple professional organization ( AHA/ACC American Diabetes Association ) . Arm , ankle , toe pressure measurement make supine position use Doppler , oscillometric method , photoplethysmographic sensor . The ankle-brachial index toe-brachial index calculate .</brief_summary>
