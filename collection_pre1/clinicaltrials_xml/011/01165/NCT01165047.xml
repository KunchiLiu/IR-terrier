	<brief_summary>The primary aim study evaluate safety , tolerability device performance GeNO nitrosyl delivery system RHC . Secondary consideration confirm inhale NO generated GeNO nitrosyl delivery system , reduces PVR patient reversible PH , contain level NO2 well upper level acceptable exposure . Further , study aim demonstrate patient response inhale NO use diagnostic tool determine proper course medical action patient chronic heart failure . Patients chronic heart failure accompany pulmonary hypertension increase pulmonary vascular resistance number possible medical therapy available . The least invasive , therefore appeal , option standard management medication observation . Alternatively , implantation leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) may consider , either permanent solution bridge strategy final option , orthotopic heart transplantation ( OHT ) . It often unclear route best medical choice , tool help physicians patient choose alternative would greatly beneficial . It show chronic heart failure patient demonstrate irreversible pulmonary hypertension , even presence vasodilator , exhibit adverse outcome OHT ( Tsai et al. , 2002 ; Ericson et al. , 1990 ; Murali et al. , 1996 ) . It follow patient response pulmonary vasodilator , use classify patient potential candidate OHT . In particular , patient response inhale NO , know pulmonary vasodilator , use diagnostic tool assist decide medical route take . With mind , current study aim demonstrate whether NO generate GeNO nitrosyl delivery system effect reduction pulmonary hypertension due increase pulmonary vascular resistance patient chronic heart failure . Any demonstrate ability inhale NO decrease PVR patient reversible PH support use patient response inhale NO diagnostic tool assist choose appropriate medical therapy patient chronic heart failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigational product administer qualified study staff accordance procedure describe protocol accordance detail set instruction supply initial shipment investigational product . Nitric oxide , 80 ppm air oxygen administer use GeNO nitrosyl delivery system standard nasal cannula flow rate 4 LPM . In order reliably measure trace level NO2 presence large excess NO , essential use technique extremely high accuracy situation low level NO2 . The GeNO nitrosyl delivery system delivers fix concentration 80ppm NO low level NO2 current technology measure accuracy level 3ppm . The investigational product GeNO nitrosyl delivery system consist drug/device combination product component necessary deliver investigational drug ; nitric oxide gas . The investigational drug , nitric oxide , generate time use NO2 input gas flow cartridge , antioxidant reduces NO2 NO . The input gas supply either nitric oxide air nitric oxide oxygen . The Investigator determine whether air oxygen use balance gas , basis participant 's clinical need supplemental oxygen .</detailed_description>
