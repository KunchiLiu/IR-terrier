	<brief_summary>Treatment cancer often effective two drug use together . For example , gemcitabine , approve drug , ON 01910.Na , new investigational anti-cancer drug , use together treat cancer cell laboratory animal , inhibition growth cancer cell compare either drug use . These result offer promise gemcitabine ON 01910.Na could use treat cancer patient . However , study seek find gemcitabine ON 01910.Na effective combination patient do , doctor must first know large , safe dose ON 01910.Na use combination gemcitabine best regimen use . This study design answer question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety 24-hour Infusion ON 01910.Na Combination With Gemcitabine Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The order infusion gemcitabine first , immediately follow ON 01910.Na ( exception first infusion patient undergo PK sampling ; ON 01910.Na infusion give first occasion ) . The dose gemcitabine fix 1000 mg/m2 i.v . 30 minute infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day . As Amendment 2 , start dose ON 01910.Na 250 mg/m2 24 hour intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion day 1 , 8 15 28-day course . The dose ON 01910.Na escalate increment successive cohort ( dose level ( DL ) 1 = 250 mg/m2 , DL 2 = 650 mg/m2 , DL 3 = 1050 mg/m2 , DL 4= 1350 mg/m2 ) new patient . A course define 4 week length . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE v3.0 ) . A minimum three new patient treat dose level minimum 1 week stagger dose first remain patient new dose cohort . In exceptional circumstance ( e.g . one slot available cohort two eligible patient screen ) , Sponsor may allow four patient enter cohort ( seven patient enter expanded cohort ) . A DL -1A ( ON 01910.Na = 125 mg/m2 ) set case dose de-escalation require start dose due ON 01910.Na-related toxicity . A DL -1A gemcitabine = 750 mg/m2 DL - 1B 500 mg/m2 set case dose de-escalation require starting subsequent dos due gemcitabine-related toxicity . If DLT observe first three patient , dose ON 01910.Na increase next level . If DLT occur first three new patient first course , least three additional new patient treat . If DLT encounter , dose escalation proceed . Alternately , DLT note one three additional patient , dose escalation terminate MTD define high dose level none first three patient one six patient experienced DLT course 1 . All patient receive dos exceed confirm MTD dose reduce MTD ; even apparently tolerate current dose . Intra-patient dose escalation ON 01910.Na permit . There limit number course could administer patient tolerate benefit therapy . Escalation next dose level occur third evaluable patient ( sixth , expand cohort ) , previous dose level observe 4 week . Dose escalation decision make Cohort Review Committee ( CRC ) . Intra-patient dose escalation ON 01910.Na allow third evaluable patient next dose level observe 4 week acceptable tolerability . Once MTD define , expand cohort 9 12 additional patient ( depend 3 6 patient enrol previous cohort ) enrol MTD dose level order define safety tolerability regimen , characterize pharmacokinetics ON 01910.Na alone gemcitabine , perform tumor biomarker study .</detailed_description>
