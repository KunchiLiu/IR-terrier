	<brief_summary>This second-generation study base result ACTIVE ( Advanced Cognitive Training Independent Vital Elderly ) . This four-arm study know IHAMS ( Iowa Healthy Active Minds Study ) . The investigator formally test intent-to-treat perspective difference primary secondary outcome base whether participant randomize basic on-site speed process training ( SOPT ) group ( G1 ) , on-site basic SOPT plus subsequent booster-training group ( G2 ) , basic at-home SOPT group ( G3 ) , basic attention-control group ( G4 ) . Basic train involve 10 hour either SOPT attention-control training first 6 week participation . Booster-training involve 4 additional hour SOPT train 11 month participation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , specific aim conduct randomize controlled trial ( RCT ) one-year follow-up fully complete within NIH Challenge Grant two-year period . The goal RCT improve cognitive performance among old adult enhance quality life future . We randomize 600 participant four treatment arm separately within two age stratum ( 50-64 , 65 old ) . The four group include : G1 , basic on-site SOPT ; G2 , on-site basic SOPT plus subsequent booster-training group ; G3 , basic at-home SOPT ; G4 , basic attention-control group . Basic train involve 10 hour either SOPT attention-control training first 6 week participation . Booster-training involve 4 additional hour SOPT train 11 month participation . Our primary outcome measure speed processing , use several reliable valid instrument provide multidimensional assessment , include Useful Field View Test , Symbol Digit Modalities Test , Trail Making Test , Controlled Oral Word Association Test , Digit Vigilance Test , Stroop Color Word Test . There seven key hypothesis ( Hn ) . H1 involve replication ACTIVE ( i.e. , on-site SOPT delivery , without booster-training ) group G1 G2 combine vs. attention control group hypothesize statistically significant evidence support benefit assign on-site training vs. attention control group . H2 H3 design separate basic training effect ( H2 ) basic plus booster-training effect ( H3 ) among on-site delivery group ( G1 G2 ) vs. attention control group ( G4 ) , hypothesize benefit SOPT training vs. attention control regardless booster-training . H4 represent test at-home delivery SOPT training ( G3 ) vs. attention control group ( G4 ) . H4 hypothesize statistically significant evidence indicate benefit assign G3 ( at-home training ) vs. attention control group ( G4 ) . H5 H6 evaluate different mode implement speed processing intervention . H5 represent head-to-head comparison basic on-site delivery vs. at-home delivery SOPT intervention . H5 hypothesizes effect at-home SOPT training ( G3 ) great effect on-site SOPT training ( G1 ) . H6 represent head-to-head comparison on-site basic plus booster SOPT training ( G2 ) vs. at-home delivery SOPT intervention . H6 hypothesizes effect at-home SOPT ( G3 ) large on-site SOPT booster-training group ( G2 ) . Finally , H7 represent head-to-head test on-site basic SOPT ( G1 ) on-site basic plus booster training SOPT group ( G2 ) . H7 hypothesize difference two reflect value booster training . The investigator replicate analysis within age stratum ( 50-64 vs. &gt; 65 ) compare effect size across stratum .</detailed_description>
