	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Nexagon Persistent Corneal Epithelial Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective , randomize , double-masked , vehicle-controlled , dose-escalation study evaluate efficacy safety Nexagon® subject persistent corneal epithelial defect ( PED ) result corneal epithelial debridement diabetic vitrectomy surgery , HSV keratitis , HZV keratitis , corneal burn , post-PRK , post-corneal transplant surgery . In general , traditional therapy PED consist aggressive lubrication preservative-free artificial tear ointment , use bandage soft contact lenses , pressure patching , punctal plugging , surgical closure eyelid . Unfortunately , success rate conventional treatment modality vary , overall , disappointingly low . As , much research currently direct find good treatment PED . Nexagon® novel therapeutic agent show effective treating skin lesion , show animal study preliminary human study safe efficacious treating PED .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male female subject age 18 year . Female subject must ) postmenopausal , b ) surgically sterilize , c ) practice abstinence , ) use hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide duration study . Subjects able attend followup visit able comply study procedure . Subjects willing able give write informed consent take part study . Subjects PED , define follow : `` corneal epithelial defect persist least 14 day longer 28 day . '' In Investigator 's opinion , defect persistent i.e. , defect show improvement despite conventional treatment tear supplement bandage contact lens . The original defect cornea must result corneal epithelial debridement diabetic vitrectomy surgery , HSV keratitis , HZV keratitis , corneal burn , postPRK , postcorneal transplant surgery . Use concomitant ocular medication screen period specify standardized PED treatment regimen Likely require use concomitant ocular medication specify standardized PED treatment regime study followup period Decrease increase PED 50 % screening period . Have active eyelid ocular infectious process sort , opinion Investigator . Subjects corneal perforation impend corneal perforation . Subjects severe eyelid abnormality contributory persistence PED . Subjects bilateral PED , small PED long diameter &gt; 2 mm . ( Note : bilateral PED present small PED &lt; 2 mm , subject eligible . In situation eye large PED enter study ) . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Female subject neither postmenopausal surgically sterile require negative urine pregnancy test Day 0 ( plus minus 1 day ) visit . Subjects history AIDS HIV . Subjects condition , Investigator 's opinion , would exclude subject participate . Treatment systemic corticosteroid ( equivalent &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone ) immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent within 7 day prior Day 0 ( plus minus 1 day ) visit , likely receive one therapy study participation Subjects participate clinical trial within 30 day prior Day 0 ( plus minus 1 day ) visit .</criteria>
