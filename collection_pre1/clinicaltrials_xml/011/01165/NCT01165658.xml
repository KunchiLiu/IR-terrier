	<brief_title>Study Hypofractionated Proton Radiation Therapy Thoracic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proton Therapy : Proton therapy type radiation design low amount radiation give healthy tissue around tumor use focused beam radiation . Radiation Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , assign receive 1 3 dos radiation therapy , base join study . The first group least 3 participant receive low total radiation dose . If first dose tolerate well first group participant study , next group participant receive second , high dose radiation . If dose tolerate , third group treat high dose . Practice Visit : You `` practice '' radiation visit plan radiation give , 1 week therapy . This practice visit take 1-2 hour . At visit , CT scan chest use study staff plan proton therapy . A mold ( make type material use cast ) also make around body use help remain still radiation therapy . Marks make skin help position body correctly radiation therapy . These mark may permanent temporary . If temporary mark wash , replace . Proton Therapy Visits : About 1 week practice radiation visit , begin receive radiation therapy . At visit , lie mold body make practice visit , line radiation therapy use mark make skin practice visit . You receive radiation therapy every weekday ( Monday-Friday ) 3 week . Each radiation session last 45-60 minute . Study Tests : Each week receive radiation therapy , ask side effect may . Your medical history record , physical exam . If doctor think need , blood ( 2 tablespoon time ) drawn routine test , and/or may CT scan check status tumor . Length Therapy : You receive proton radiation therapy 3 week . The radiation therapy stop early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up Visits : About 6 week last dose proton radiation , CT scan chest ( contrast agent , possible ) physical exam . About 3 month first follow-up visit physical exam , lung function test , either PET/CT scan CT scan chest check status disease . Long-term Follow-up : Every 3 month first 2 year finish proton therapy , every 6 month next 3 year , 1 time every year , ask return clinic follow-up test . These test may include lung function test , image scan ( CT PET/CT scan ) , and/or ECG . This doctor . This investigational study . At time , consider investigational give proton radiation therapy dose schedule use study . This schedule use research purpose . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
