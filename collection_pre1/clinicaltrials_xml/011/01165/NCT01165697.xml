	<brief_summary>Fabry disease , x-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease ( LSD ) commonly recognize cause renal failure involve men recently recognize woman . Women involve significant number complication , men , vascular disease . This manifest unexpected stroke young adult . We morphologic evidence storage-endotheliopathy induced microvascular disease cause cardiopathy cryptogenic stroke , storage endotheliopathy start early life , probably birth . Based earlier work endotheliopathies diabetes mellitus , Susac syndrome , hypertension , find study patient use unique method , neuro-retinal fluorescein angiography ( NRFA ) , develop purpose . These method include NRFA demonstrate capillary perfusion optic nerve head retinal quadrant . We anticipate , base early experience endotheliopathies , show vascular pathology earlier previously report . Using epidemiologic genetic tool find patient previously know expect . It offer opportunity earlier diagnosis , prognosis , response enzyme replacement therapy . We hypothesize Fabry disease poorly recognize poorly characterize cause microvascular disease cryptogenic stroke young woman men . Neuroretinal capillary perfusion abnormality Fabry disease predictive equivalent vascular disease kidney , heart , brain organ , responsive change induce enzyme replacement therapy treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Specific Aim 1 . To demonstrate specificity sensitivity diagnostic capability neuroretinal examination include slit lamp fundoscopy , NRFA diagnosis Fabry disease subject population identify FD patient . Specific Aim 2 . To show capillary perfusion abnormality optic nerve retina use neuroretinal fluorescein angiography patient Fabry disease compare renal ( measure GFR ) . Specific Aim 3 . To show change capillary perfusion study compare baseline response enzyme replacement therapy treatment time , manifestation tissue burden prognosis sensitive biomarker extent patient disease corneal keratopathy .</detailed_description>
