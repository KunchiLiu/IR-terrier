The registry describe patient population regard demographic , clinical factor , risk stratification , geographic region . In particular , attention focus utilization , effectiveness , safety antithrombotic therapy prevention stroke .

	<detailed_description>The ORBIT-AF registry multicenter prospective outpatient disease registry patient incident ( initial diagnosis ) prevalent ( exist diagnosis ) atrial fibrillation ( AF ) analyze treatment pattern outcomes patient AF US . Approximately 10,000 prospective cohort patient enrol . The registry nation-wide collaboration Health Care Providers ( e.g. , cardiologist , internist , primary care physician , electrophysiologists , quality improvement personnel , office/practice manager , research coordinator , pharmacist ) . This collaborative effort focus optimization outpatient management patient AF . Consecutive patient meet eligibility criterion approach educate registry . Patients express interest provide inform consent . Patients enrol registry follow approximately 3 year . Patient follow-up AF care provider continue schedule accord local clinical practice . Patient Reported outcome ( PRO ) questionnaires administer sub-sample approximately 1,500 patient . For patient consent answer PRO questionnaire , questionnaire administer site patient baseline visit [ except baseline Anticoagulation-Related Treatment Satisfaction ( ACTS ) ] regularly schedule follow-up visit . The baseline ACTS incident patient complete return back site least 4 week start antithrombotic therapy . The ACTS questionnaire administer patient take antithrombotic therapy within 4 week visit newly prescribe antithrombotic therapy . Data collection occur 6-month interval minimum 3 year ( baseline , 6 month , 12 month , 18 month , 24 month , 30 month , 36 month ) . The data collection window wide ( 3 month either direction ) order maximize data collection patient regularly schedule follow-up AF care provider . Collection Patient Reported Outcome ( PRO ) Questionnaires continue beyond 24-month data collection interval . Atrial Fibrillation Data capture include demographic , cardiovascular risk factor , diagnosis , type AF ( paroxysmal , persistent , permanent AF ) , treatment strategy ( rate vs. rhythm ) , ablation history , cardioversions , antithrombotic therapy decision monitoring ( INRs ) , concomitant medication dos , insurance provider information , AF quality-of-life , anticoagulation treatment satisfaction , caregiver assistance , pet ownership , comorbidities , compliance , outcomes . Pre-defined outcomes interest include stroke non-CNS ( non-systemic ) embolism , major adverse cardiac event , all-cause mortality , cause-specific death ( sudden , non-sudden , heart failure-related ) , major bleeding , AF-related quality life , anticoagulation-related treatment satisfaction , all-cause hospitalization specific anticoagulation outcome ( e.g . time therapeutic range primary discontinuation oral anticoagulation ) . The data generate registry use identify real world practice , especially compare relates guideline set forth American College Cardiology , American Heart Association European Society Cardiology management patient AF . Observational Study - No investigational drug administer . For patient receive sponsor 's drug , Xarelto ( rivaroxaban ) , direction physician , serious adverse event non-serious related event report sponsor ( Janssen Scientific Affairs , LLC )</detailed_description>
