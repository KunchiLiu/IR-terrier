	<detailed_description>Each year , '' estimate 250,000 case central line-associated bloodstream infection occur U.S. hospital , estimate 30,000 62,000 patient die result '' ( AHRQ 2008 ) . The marginal cost health-care system approximately $ 25,000 per episode ( CDC 2002 ) .Inconsistent outdated clinical practice identify key factor problem ( 5 Million Lives Campaign 2008 ) . Subsequently , order improve overall healthcare delivery outcomes , current future healthcare professional need complement clinical skill systems-based skill : ( ) deliver patient-centered care , ( b ) work multidisciplinary care team , ( c ) practice evidence-based medicine , ( ) focus quality improvement , e ) use information technology ( IOM 2003 ) . Specific problem central line , February 2005 chart review institutional patient safety issue , LVHN internal quality committee find multiple case involve insertion central line , include case involve arterial placement malposition.The internal quality committee review reveal new resident primarily involve case . According literature , risk central line complication tend decrease operator experience ( Runyon , 1986 ) .A fail catheter placement attempt one strong predictor subsequent complication ( Haire &amp; Lieberman , 1995 ) . As result committee 's finding review literature , standardized Central Line Access Placement course design part incoming residents'orientation process . Using Donald Kirkpatrick 's Four-Level Evaluation model ( Kirkpatrick Kirkpatrick 2006 ) theoretical framework , study analyzes impact central line simulation course resident mid-level provider ' clinical performance patient outcomes.It goal study contribute knowledge-base health professional education build sustainable model one set learning development intervention , expectation finding broad relevance patient safety initiative , health professional training development program , healthcare delivery improvement . Care bundle grouping best practice respect disease process individually improve care , apply together result substantially great improvement.The science support bundle component sufficiently establish consider standard care ( 5 Million Lives Campaign 2008 ) .The central line bundle group evidence-based intervention patient intravascular central catheter , implement together , result good outcome implement individually.The central line bundle five key component : 1 . Hand hygiene 2 . Maximal barrier precaution 3 . Chlorhexidine skin antisepsis 4 . Optimal catheter site selection , subclavian vein prefer site non-tunneled catheter 5 . Daily review line necessity , prompt removal unnecessary line Research Questions How quality central line instruction relate learner attitude , knowledge , compliance central line bundle ? How variation among course participant quality central line instruction , knowledge central line , central line bundle compliance , factor relate complication infection rate patient ? How central line bundle compliance central line-related complication infection rate LVHN change past several year , change correspond change policy practice regard central line occur since 2005 ? Objectives 1.Analyze impact central line simulation course learner , patient business outcome . 2.Incorporate 'standard care ' course improvement enrich analysis research . Hypotheses H0 : There association among quality central line instruction , learner knowledge , compliance central line bundle , complication infection rate , change policy practice since 2005 . H1 : There association among quality central line instruction , learner knowledge , compliance central line bundle , complication infection rate change policy practice since 2005 . Hc : There direct correlation among quality central line instruction , learner knowledge , compliance central line bundle , complication/infection rate . Hk &amp; b : There probably ratio among complication/infection rate central line base variation learner knowledge score bundle compliance . Hp &amp; p : There probability ratio among complication/infection rate central line base change Lehigh Valley Health Network policy practice time ( month ) .</detailed_description>
