	<detailed_description>The use central venous catheter ( CVCs ) increase inpatient outpatient settings.CVCs disturb skin integrity create vulnerability bacterial fungal infection . It estimate 90 % bloodstream infection associate catheter , due CVCs , 500 4,000 patient United States die annually due bloodstream infection ( Mermel , 2000 ) . The risk central line ( CL ) associate bloodstream infection ( CLAB ) typically express number line infection per 1000 catheter days.A recent study demonstrate follow set standardize procedure reduce mean CLAB rate 7.7 per 1000 catheter day 1.4 ( Pronovost et al. , 2006 ) .In effort decrease hospital acquire bloodstream infection complication result CVCs , initiative standardize track CL placement throughout institution propose . A uniform CL protocol develop ; practice guideline update base current evidence , standard procedural checklist develop base CL care bundle recommend Institute Healthcare Improvement ( IHI ) ( 5 Million Lives , 2007 ) .Generally , care bundle series best practice enhance care apply individually , considerably improve care implement together.The CL care bundle include hand hygiene , barrier precaution , chlorhexidine skin antisepsis , optimal site selection , daily consideration line necessity , timely removal unnecessary line ( 5 Million Lives , 2007 ) .Another goal initiative create CL registry capture store data relevant CL place throughout institution.This registry provide wealth data CL insertion complication may use valuable source information quality assurance , performance improvement , research.Finally , knowledge information obtain registry , educational offering create , standardized institutional process CL insertion develop . Objective : 1.To capture information CL insertion throughout institution.2.To capture track amount day patient CL place.3.To capture track CL infectious complications.4.To capture track mechanical complications.5.To capture data , may use valuable source information quality assurance , performance improvement , education , research .</detailed_description>
