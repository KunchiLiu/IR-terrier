	<brief_summary>Each year four million baby die neonatal period , majority occur develop country . Overall , infection account one-third neonatal death , proportion approach 50 % setting neonatal mortality rate high . Infections predominately due sepsis , respiratory infection , tetanus , diarrhea . The investigator long term goal identify simple , affordable , effective intervention deliver community level low-resource setting reduce neonatal mortality risk due infection . The investigator team conduct research area past 10 year , specific focus newborn vitamin A dosing topical chlorhexidine antisepsis intervention . Previous community-based research investigator group investigator others demonstrate newborn vitamin A dosing reduce early infant mortality approximately 20 % , topical application chlorhexidine umbilical cord prevent omphalitis reduce neonatal mortality risk 24 % . Evidence grow neonatal skin play important role protect newborn infant invasive pathogen . Barrier function neonatal skin , however , incomplete newborn infant , especially pre-term low birth weight . Full-body massage newborn mustard oil , practice almost universally ( ~95 % ) communities south Asia , may compromise skin barrier function decrease structural integrity lead increase trans-epidermal water loss increase risk percutaneous penetration invasive pathogen . Loss structural integrity see massage neonatal skin alternative topical emollient , include sunflower seed oil . Furthermore , sunflower seed oil show accelerate recovery skin barrier function , improve skin condition , reduce risk nosocomial infection neonatal mortality among hospitalized newborn low-resource setting . The specific hypothesis study substitute mustard oil sunflower seed oil topical application full body massage newborns community reduce neonatal mortality morbidity improve overall skin barrier function reduce exposure invasive pathogen .</brief_summary>
