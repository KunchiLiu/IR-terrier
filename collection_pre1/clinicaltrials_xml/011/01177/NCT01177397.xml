	<detailed_description>Initially , patient treat oral CC-223 one month . During time , various test ( involve blood urine collection , ECGs , etc ) perform . Those whose tumor stabilize regress may continue receive treatment long benefit CC-223 . Different dose level CC-223 test dose-rising study design .</detailed_description>
