	<brief_title>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) Symptom Cluster Trial Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer survivor live longer may live many symptom incurred disease treatment . Survivors 1 2 year treatment report continue fatigue , depression , pain sleep disturbance ( Kenefick 2006 ; Byar et al . 2006 ) . Patients often present several concurrent symptom ( Dodd et al . 2001 ; Esper Heidrich 2005 ) . It believe symptom tend cluster together ( two concurrent symptom related one another independent symptom ) may natural association , similar share pathway underlie mechanism ( Barsevick 2007 ) . Currently , little know symptom cluster breast cancer survivor treatment , underlie mechanism , intervention influence multiple symptom simultaneously ( Lee et al . 2004 ; Cleeland et al . 2003 ) . Very study test intervention post-treatment survivorship ( Cimprich et al . 2005 ; Mishel et al . 2005 ; Stanton et al . 2005 ; Scheier et al . 2005 ) . Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) , standardized form meditation yoga , show effective reduce anxiety , depression stress patient chronic pain ( Kabat-Zinn et al . 1992 ; Miller et al . 1995 ; Teasdale et al . 2000 ; Kabat-Zinn et al . 1985 ) . Preliminary result 2 pilot study conduct research team provide support MBSR breast cancer survivor may effective markedly reduce symptom , increase quality life , decrease fear recurrence ( Lengacher et al . 2009 ; Lengacher et al . 2006 ) . This propose study build preliminary data MBSR Breast Cancer Program ( BC ) reduce stress , biological marker stress response ( pro-inflammatory cytokine ) improve physical , psychological symptom quality life breast cancer survivor . We aim determine : ( ) extent MBSR ( BC ) program efficacious improve outcome ; ( ii ) whether positive effect MBSR ( BC ) mediate increased mindfulness reduce fear recurrence ; ( iii ) subgroup patient determine derive benefit MBSR ( BC ) . Formal specific aim follow : Aim ( 1 ) . Evaluate efficacy MBSR ( BC ) program improve psychological physical symptom , quality life measure immune function stress hormone ( cortisol ) . We hypothesize compare usual care regimen , patient randomly assign MBSR ( BC ) program experience great improvement 6 week sustain improvement 12 week follow : 1 . Individual psychological symptom , include depression anxiety , perceive stress ; 2 . Individual physical symptom , include pain , fatigue sleep dysfunction ; 3 . Quality life ; 4 . Biological stress marker ( pro-inflammatory immune cytokine , cellular adhesion molecule , lymphocyte subset ) stress-related hormone ( cortisol ) . Aim ( 2 ) . Test whether positive effect achieve MBSR ( BC ) program ( defined 1a-1d ) mediate change mindfulness fear recurrence breast cancer . We hypothesize : 1 . Patients MBSR ( BC ) program report great increase mindfulness large reduction fear recurrence compare patient assign usual care regimen . 2 . Increased mindfulness relate directly improvements psychological physical symptom , quality life measure immune function stress hormone ( cortisol ) . 3 . Reductions fear recurrence associate improvement psychological physical symptom , quality life measure immune function stress hormone ( cortisol ) . 4 . A primary pathway MBSR exert positive effect ( define 1a-1d ) increase mindfulness lead reduce fear recurrence cancer . Aim ( 3 ) . Evaluate whether positive effect achieve MBSR ( BC ) program ( defined 1a-1d ) modify specific patient characteristic measure baseline . We hypothesize efficacy MBSR ( BC ) program great among patient : 1 . High anxiety , high perceive stress , low optimism poor quality life 2 . Specific symptom profile ( i.e . highly distressed patient ) , determine grouping ( cluster ) patient accord present symptom . To achieve research goal , propose 2-group randomized clinical trial among 300 breast cancer survivor undergo lumpectomy and/or mastectomy radiation and/or chemotherapy past two year . The MBSR ( BC ) program evaluate waitlisted usual care regimen ( UC ) , patient assessment make baseline , 6 week , 12 week . Patient assessment provide data depression , state anxiety , perceive stress , fatigue , pain , sleep , symptom severity , quality life , mindfulness , fear recurrence , optimism social support . Additionally , blood saliva sample collect participant . Biological stress marker measure blood specimen collection ; biological stress marker include pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1β , TNF-α , IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-1-RA , TNF-RA , IL-8 , IFN-gamma ) , cellular adhesion marker ( CD11a , CD54 , CD62L , CD45RA , CD45RO ) lymphocyte subset ( CD3 , CD19 , CD16+56 ) . A stress hormone , cortisol , measure saliva specimen collection . The MBSR ( BC ) intervention adapt 6-week program follow curriculum 8-week program establish Kabat Zinn Santorelli . Prior formal hypothesis testing , distribution explanatory outcome variable , well covariates , examine . For outcome variable skew distribution , appropriate transformation ( e.g . square root , logarithmic , etc . ) perform satisfy normality requirement parametric multivariable linear modeling . This include choose transformation yield low Anderson-Darling score . In instance appropriate transformation achieve , non-parametric method use . Results study advance conceptual clinical knowledge stress-reducing intervention impact symptoms among breast cancer survivor may efficacious . Determining stress-related biological effect may applicable stress-reducing intervention study . This symptom symptom cluster assessment intervention model understand biology behavior test predictive personalize model health care .</detailed_description>
