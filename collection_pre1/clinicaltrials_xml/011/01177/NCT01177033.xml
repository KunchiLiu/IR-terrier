	<brief_summary>CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL SUMMARY / SYNOPSIS Phase : IV TITLE OF STUDY Angioplasty Bypass Surgery Intermittent Claudication ( ABC-Trial ) : randomise controlled trial patient complex lesion superficial femoral artery CONDITION Peripheral arterial occlusive disease ( PAOD ) OBJECTIVE ( S ) The objective study evaluate safety efficacy two therapeutic strategy ( operative versus endovascular ) treatment patient complex atherosclerotic lesion superficial femoral artery . INTERVENTIONS Intervention type I : Best endovascular treatment ( stent-protected angioplasty ) . Intervention type II : Best surgical treatment ( femoro-popliteal bypass knee autologous vein ( 1° choice ) prosthetic graft ( vein available ) . Duration intervention per patient : Dependent method treatment Follow-up per patient : 24 month OUTCOMES Primary efficacy endpoint : Two primary efficacy endpoint consider simultaneously trial : ( A ) Event-free survival ( time-to-event endpoint ) : Proportion ( course time ) survive patient show continue clinical improvement &gt; = 1 class ( Rutherford classification ) without need repeat target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) . ( B ) Proportion survive patient clinical improvement &gt; = 1 class ( Rutherford classification ) 24 month primary intervention ( regardless perform re-intervention ) .</brief_summary>
