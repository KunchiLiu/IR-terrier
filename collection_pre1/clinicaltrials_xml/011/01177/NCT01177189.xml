	<brief_title>Oxidative Stress Links Aging , Activity Mobility Limitation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With premise U.S . Veteran demographic reveal age population significant mobility limitation oxidative stress tightly link characteristic , series skeletal muscle/vascular study propose . Specifically , series recent study investigator ' group document positive vascular consequence antioxidant supplementation exercise old subject negatively impacted young people . Further provocative finding reveal follow exercise train old subject also negatively impacted antioxidant supplementation . These finding implication understand complex balance positive effect exercise-based rehabilitation , exercise induce oxidative stress , age , frailty , subsequent mobility limitation . Therefore four specific aim propose answer question ( I ) oxidative stress prevalent elderly , ( II ) oxidative stress occur elderly , ( III ) acute consequence oxidative stress elderly , finally ( IV ) exercise-induced oxidative stress result exercise training elderly appropriately manage exogenous antioxidant therapy promote compliance positive outcome increase mobility .</detailed_description>
