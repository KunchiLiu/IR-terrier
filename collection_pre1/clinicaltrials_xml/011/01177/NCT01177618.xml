	<brief_title>Boston Early-Onset Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , third lead cause death United States , affect million people around world . COPD , include emphysema chronic bronchitis , affect lung make difficult breathe . Cigarette smoke common risk factor develop COPD ; however , 15 % 20 % smoker develop COPD lifetime . The onset COPD also vary greatly person person ; people develop respiratory symptom later life , others develop severe COPD early age . Prior research lead discovery alpha-1 antitrypsin protein deficiency association COPD development . This discovery generate interest toward study genetic factor may also affect individual 's likelihood develop COPD . Therefore , purpose Boston Early-Onset COPD study gain well understand COPD risk factor order establish new possible method treatment people affect COPD . For study enrol individual affect severe COPD ( 52 year old young FEV1 &lt; 40 % ) family member . Each participant attend one study visit involve respiratory questionnaire , breathe test , blood draw . This visit complete participant 's home , hospital , long distance data collection ( phone interview , local breathing test , local blood draw mail sample ) , whichever prefer .</detailed_description>
