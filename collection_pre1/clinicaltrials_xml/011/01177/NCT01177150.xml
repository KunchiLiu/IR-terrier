	<brief_title>A First-in-Human Study JNJ-28431754 Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center study conduct two Parts ( Part 1 Part 2 ) . Volunteers may participate Part 1 Part 2 study Part 1 Part 2 . Part 1 study evaluate safety tolerability single , oral ( mouth ) escalating ( increase ) dose JNJ 28431754 ( range 10 mg 600 mg ) placebo healthy male volunteer . The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , JNJ 28431754 absorb , distribute , remove body time pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , effect JNJ-28431754 body , also evaluate . Part 2 study randomize , 2 period crossover study 8 eligible male volunteer receive single oral dose JNJ 28431754 2 occasion ( 14 day apart ) without food ( ie , standard meal ) ass effect co-administration food PK PD JNJ-28431754 . In Part 1 , least 48 healthy male volunteer meet entry criterion randomize ( assigned chance ) 6 cohort ( dose group ) receive single oral dose study drug ( JNJ-28431754 placebo ) ; study drug assign volunteer double-blinded ( neither investigator volunteer know identity assign treatment ) . One additional cohort may add study ; additional cohort may test previously test dose JNJ 28431754 2 equally divided dos , administer 10 hour apart . Each volunteer participate one dose group . Each dose group evaluate different dose strength JNJ-28431754 ( 10 mg 600 mg ) start low dose . Volunteers dose group require stay overnight clinical research unit ( CRU ) 6 night receive study drug safety , tolerability , PK , PD assessment perform . Patients return CRU final safety follow-up visit 10 14 day study drug administration . For volunteer , total duration Part 1 study least 5 week ( include 3-week screening period ) . In Part 2 study , 8 eligible male volunteer receive single oral dose JNJ 28431754 2 occasion ( 14 day apart ) without food ( ie , standard meal ) ; JNJ-28431754 administer volunteer `` open-label '' treatment ( ie , volunteer know receive active drug ) . Part 2 begin sufficient data collect Part 1 select dose JNJ-28431754 Part 2 study ( dose select within dose range evaluate Part 1 study ) . Volunteers require stay overnight CRU 5 night 2 occasion receive study drug post dose safety , tolerability , PK , PD assessment perform . Patients return CRU final safety follow-up visit 10 14 day 2nd single-dose administration JNJ-38431754 . For volunteer , total duration Part 2 study approximately 7 week ( include 3-week screening period 2-week interval 2 single-dose administration JNJ 38431754 ) . Volunteers Part 1 Part 2 study monitor safety study evaluate adverse event report result vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram , physical examination perform laboratory test . Part 1 : One dose JNJ-28431754 ( 10mg 600mg ) placebo administer overnight fast least 10 hour ( additional cohort , previously test dos administer 2 equally divided dos take 10 hour apart ) . Part 2 : One dose JNJ-28431754 administer 2 occasion ( 14 day apart ) overnight fast least 10 hour without standard meal . All dos study drug administer patient orally use oral dispenser .</detailed_description>
