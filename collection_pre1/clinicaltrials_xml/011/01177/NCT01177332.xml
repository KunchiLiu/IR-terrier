	<brief_summary>There increase evidence hepatic lipid content ( IntraHepatic Lipid , IHL ) markedly increase risk metabolic complication , include insulin resistance cardiovascular event . The investigator hypothesize liver passively take free fatty acid ( FFA ) availability high , thereby lead increase storage . To test hypothesis , investigator want manipulate FFA level , mean fast exercise recovery protocol , monitor IHL content hepatic Adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) inorganic phosphate ( Pi ) concentration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Elevated Circulating FFA Intrahepatic Lipid Content</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Netherlands worldwide , number individual suffer type 2 diabetes mellitus rise steadily . As consequence , dramatic increase diabetes-related morbidity mortality expect next decade . Accordingly , concert effort aim reduce diabetes rate towards effective diabetes management need . One early hallmark type 2 diabetes resistance peripheral tissue liver muscle action insulin , generally refer insulin resistance . Development insulin resistance strongly promote obesity . In fact obesity major risk factor insulin resistance , 80 % type 2 diabetic patient overweight obese . Whereas obesity definition characterize excessive accumulation fat body , specifically accumulation fat within peripheral tissue ( call steatosis ectopic fat accumulation ) , associate development insulin resistance . Indeed , type 2 diabetic patient first-degree relative characterize excessive accumulation fat skeletal muscle . Similarly , presence fatty liver patient type 2 diabetes obesity long report . This accumulation fat liver markedly increase risk metabolic complication , include insulin resistance cardiovascular event . Despite well-known detrimental effect ectopic fat accumulation , completely understood fat accumulates muscle liver . In recent year , non-invasive method like proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRS ) develop quantify lipid content skeletal muscle liver , frequently apply u others . These measurement combine Magnetic Resonance technique investigate hepatic ATP- Pi concentration , determine phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) . Furthermore , show ATP- Pi concentration low subject type 2 diabetes mellitus , characterize hepatic lipid accumulation hepatic insulin resistance . It suggest decreased ATP Pi concentration may underlie factor hepatic lipid accumulation . Human study use hepatic 1H-MRS report intrahepatic lipid ( IHL ) content associate obesity , metabolic syndrome diabetes . Furthermore , period 36 hour fast increase IHL dramatically . These condition characterize elevate plasma FFA level . We hypothesize increased passive uptake FFAs lead mismatch uptake oxidation FFA availability high . Interestingly , result skeletal muscle show elevation FFA level lipid infusion result increase lipid content 4 hour . Similarly , show skeletal muscle lipid content increase inactive arm muscle prolong cycling exercise fast state , FFA typically increase 1450 mmol . These result suggest high circulatory FFA level lead unrestrained uptake FA skeletal muscle , independent oxidative need . Whether IHL accumulation also resultant elevate plasma FFA level currently unknown . Please note study cite , whereas skeletal muscle lipid content increase inactive arm muscle , decrease active vastus lateralis muscle , reflect use intramuscular lipid store substrate prolong muscular activity . Whether intensify use IHL exercise also lead decrease IHL presently unknown .</detailed_description>
