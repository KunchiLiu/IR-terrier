	<brief_title>Effect Intake Bioactive Molecules From Natural Pasteurised Milk Gut Maturation Very Premature Newborns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One hundred infant born 28 30 week gestational age enrol clinical trial two neonatal unit Marseille ; receive small enteral feeding protocol natural pasteurize milk ( accord Neonatology Department ) . Infants monitor conduct birth 32 week gestational age extra-uterine growth , dietary type evolution determination gut maturation marker level blood ( Triglycerides Cholesterol , PUFA , GLP-2 , I L-FABP , Gastrin , Citrullin ) faeces ( Calprotectine ) . We also look new biological marker intestinal growth , via metabolomic approach . Consumption bioactives molecule ( PUFA , sphingomyelin , sCD14 , insulin , leptin , lactoferrin , sphingomyelinase acid BSSL activity ) quantify milk 24h-representative sample receive newborn . The benefit digestive tract physiology evolution due molecule consumption observe 32nd week 36th week end hospitalization .</detailed_description>
