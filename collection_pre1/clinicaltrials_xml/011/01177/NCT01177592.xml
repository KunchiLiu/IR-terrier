	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-center , randomized trial include 1500 subject require PCI . Subjects ischemic heart disease due stenotic lesion either native coronary artery coronary artery bypass undergo PCI stent placement contraindication prolong dual antiplatelet therapy ( ≥1 year ) eligible study . Subjects randomize either guided antiplatelet therapy arm ( n=750 ) standard therapy arm ( n=750 ) undergo laboratory testing , antiplatelet adjustment , clinical follow-up 1 year . Patients ( non-emergent ) present PCI receive standard pre-procedural PCI care outline current ACC/AHA guideline . Subjects consent peri- PCI ( prior within 24 hour PCI ) randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) guide standard non-guided ( control ) antiplatelet therapy . Physicians blind genotyping platelet function result subject randomized standard therapy group duration study endpoint meet . Subjects chronic clopidogrel prasugrel therapy ( ≥ 2 week ) guide VerifyNow P2Y12 assay , whereas clopidogrel naïve subject guide Verigene CYP2C19 genotyping assay . Patients clopidogrel maintenance and/or control group also genotyped ; conversely , clopidogrel naïve subject VerifyNow test prior discharge additional study analysis . Patients guide therapy group measurement ≥ 230 PRU reload 60mg prasugrel receive standard maintenance dosing . Similarly , clopidogrel naïve subject consider CYP2C19*2 carrier also reload 60mg prasugrel receive standard maintenance dosing ( see flow schematic ) . Patients randomize control arm remain 75mg clopidogrel arm throughout study . All patient remain 325mg ASA one month 81-162 mg daily ASA thereafter . Clinical follow-up ( office visit ) post-PCI VerifyNow maintenance test occur 2 week , 3 month , 6 month patient guide therapy group . VerifyNow test , adverse event occurrence drug compliance perform part follow-up . Patients measurement ≥ 230 PRU 2 week 3 month visit reload 60 mg prasugrel receive standard maintenance dose thereafter 6-month visit . Patients guide control study arm return 6 month clinical follow-up VerifyNow testing . After complete 6 month study treatment period , antiplatelet therapy physician 's discretion . At 1 year , study subject contact via phone clinical assessment antiplatelet compliance . Physicians adjudicate event blind therapy assignment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must age 1885 . Patients undergo PCI . Patients undergo coronary angiography possible PCI plan use least one drugeluting stent ( DES ) . One bare metal stent ( BMS ) may implant , lesion may treat without stenting , long least one DES implant . However procedure must successful uncomplicated lesion ( DES + BMS + non stent ) . Indication procedure may stable angina ischemia , unstable angina , nonST elevation MI ( NSTEMI ) . Have ability understand requirement study , include consent use disclosure researchrelated health information . Have ability comply study procedure protocol , include require study visit . A female patient eligible enter study ( 1 ) childbearing potential pregnant nursing ; ( 2 ) child bear potential ( i.e . hysterectomy , ovary remove , tubal ligation , postmenopausal , define 24 month without menses ) . Cardiovascular Cardiogenic shock . Ischemic Stroke within 6 week Planned stag PCI next 6 month postprocedure Unsuccessful PCI ( postprocedure diameter stenosis &gt; 30 % less TIMI3 flow treat vessel ) . Patients inhospital STEMI confirm ECG prior randomization require target vessel revascularization index lesion prior randomization . Major complication PCI limit need balloon pump , acute stent thrombosis , major bleed . Prior concomitant therapy Concurrent plan treatment warfarin . IIb/IIIa Inhibitors within 72 hr PCI Current plan treatment Cilostazol Current treatment Prasugrel Hemorrhagic risk History bleed diathesis evidence active abnormal bleeding within 30 day randomization . History hemorrhagic stroke subarachnoid hemorrhage time stroke TIA etiology within 30 day randomization . Major surgery within 6 week prior randomization . Known platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 .
