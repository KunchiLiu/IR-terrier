Studies suggest significant percentage veteran may suffer `` subthreshold '' PTSD ; although symptom presentation less severe , veterans experience emotional distress reduce quality life . Given Veterans Affairs ( VA ) mental-health service provider face important challenge task alleviate emotional suffering service men woman stay within budget confines , need effective , practical , evidence-based treatment deliver expedient cost-effective manner . Thus , current project two primary objective : 1 ) develop , implement , evaluate treatment program ( Behavioral Activation Therapeutic Exposure , BATE ) OIF OEF veteran PTSD symptom , 2 ) determine whether program deliver via telepsychology effective in-person treatment . Secondary objective include determine : 1 ) treatment modality effective term process variable ( e.g. , treatment satisfaction , session attendance ) , 2 ) treatment modality cost-effective , 3 ) whether treatment effect differ across race gender . Study participant randomize two treatment condition , BATE deliver via telepsychology ( BATE-T ) BATE deliver in-person ( BATE-IP ) . The current treatment protocol base two , research-supported therapeutic rationale , Behavioral Activation ( BA ) Therapeutic Exposure ( TE ) . Briefly , treatment aim increase participant 's engagement healthy activity ( i.e. , activity naturally reinforce promote participant 's life value ) exposure activity ( i.e. , activity target specific PTSD symptom avoidance hyperarousal ) .

The anticipated duration study four year . Based result study , finalize treatment manual . In term clinical applicability , plan present study finding conference disseminate treatment manual VA mental health service provider approximately four five year . Study finding address important gap PTSD literature , yield several contribution field . First , extent BATE effectively reduce symptom severity , investigational treatment may benefit individual OIF/OEF service men woman alleviate emotional suffering improve quality life . Second , extent BATE prevents development full-blown PTSD subclinical military personnel , investigational treatment may reduce attrition military due untreated mental health problem . Third , small percentage might benefit counsel actually seek service due barrier associate traditional service delivery practice geographic distance VA hospital stigma psychological treatment . Thus , telemedicine show circumvent barrier care , current project potential reach otherwise underserved population : subclinical OIF OEF service men woman may reluctant seek care . Fourth , extent BATE-T produce result comparable BATE-IP , study may potentially identify cost-effective alternative in-person treatment thereby reduce post-service treatment cost VA 's .</detailed_description>
