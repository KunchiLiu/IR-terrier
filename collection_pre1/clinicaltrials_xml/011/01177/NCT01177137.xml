	<brief_title>Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Trial ( TRTT ) , fund National Institute Deafness Other Communication Disorders , multi-center randomized clinical trial test efficacy tinnitus retrain therapy ( TRT ) versus standard-of-care ( SC ) treatment individual self-perceived intolerable tinnitus . TRT non-medical intervention use directive counseling ( DC ) low-level sound therapy ( ST ) achieve sound generator ( SGs ) habituate patient 's associated negative emotional reaction ( annoyance ) tinnitus , perception ( awareness ) , ultimately , impact participant 's life . Study participant include active retired military personnel U. S. Armed Forces dependent suffer severe tinnitus . The study conduct flagship Air Force , Navy Medical Centers . This trial evaluate efficacy TRT component ( DC ST ) versus standard care ( SC ) administer military comparing efficacy : - ( 1 ) TRT ( DC ST achieve use conventional sound generator ) versus SC ; - ( 2 ) TRT versus partial TRT ( DC placebo sound generator ) evaluate separate effect sound therapy , assumption placebo noise generator provide meaningful sound therapy beyond found SC ; - ( 3 ) partial TRT versus SC evaluate separate effect DC . Eligibility determine Baseline Eligibility Visit , consist medical tinnitus history , physical examination , baseline audiological/tinnitus/hyperacusis evaluation . Study participant also complete series quality life psychological profile test . Study Audiologists administer randomly assign treatment . Follow-up visit Clinical Centers take place 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month include completion tinnitus outcome questionnaires visit . Psychometric test audiological/tinnitus/hyperacusis evaluation take place 6 , 12 , 18 month visit . Evaluation audiometric pure tone loudness discomfort level also take place treatment visit . The primary outcome measure TRTT change score Tinnitus Questionnaire ( TQ ) longitudinally assessed baseline follow-up ( i.e. , 3 , 6 , 12 18 month follow treatment ) . Secondary outcome include change sub-scales TQ , change score Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) , Tinnitus Functional Index ( TFI ) , Hearing Handicap Inventory ( HHI ) , TRT visual analogue scale , change Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST ) . Psychometric secondary outcome also include change psychoacoustic variable relate tinnitus sensation , include tinnitus pitch loudness match , loudness discomfort level . The TRTT design sufficient power detect minimal clinically important difference Tinnitus Questionnaire ( TQ ) i.e. , 10 point difference TRT SC group change TQ global score longitudinally assess course follow-up 7-point difference TQ score TRT component , DC ST .</detailed_description>
