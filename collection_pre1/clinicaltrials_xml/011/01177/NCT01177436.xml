	<detailed_description>Nowadays , prostate cancer screen largely widespread although recommended yet . This screen include primarily digital rectal examination PSA . The main drawback poor PSA specificity . Prostate cancer diagnosis histologic diagnosis ( mainly prostate biopsy ) . However , prostate needle biopsy poor rentability negative 60 80 % . Recently , new specific genetic marker prostate cancer discover . It PCA-3 gene . This gene encode RNAm noncoding . So , RNA expression must assay RT-PCR . The main objective evaluate prospectively new marker patient treat prostatic pathology ( benign malign ) department . PCA-3 assay make urine specimen collect vesical catheterism surgery . Moreover , investigator analyse expression several prostatic marker ( gene cod androgen receptor steroid alpha-reductase type 1 2 ) . The main objective improve prostate cancer diagnosis specificity . Gene expression assay RT-PCR . Prostatic cell urine specimen confirm assay PSA gene expression . Normalization data perform use 3 housekeep gene expression ( ÃŸ-actin , K-a-1 tubulin Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ) . The originality clinical study compare previous report , consist two element . Firstly , patient include study operate prostate cancer BPH . So , risk ignore prostate cancer low unlike prostate biopsy make prostate cancer screen . Secondly , PCA-3 assay couple others prostatic specific marker .</detailed_description>
