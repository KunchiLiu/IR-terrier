	<brief_summary>The purpose research study child tic never develop Tourette syndrome . In word , aim find feature may predict whose tic go away whose tic continue worsen , child age 5 17 year whose first tic occur within past 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Children With Tic Onset Past 6 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 30 % child tic point . However , tic last whole year ( ) occur 3 % population . Thus tic persistence may unusual tic onset , yet almost data exist people recent-onset tic go diagnosable Tourette syndrome chronic tic disorder , versus whose tic transient . The overall goal research identify , prospectively , image , clinical neuropsychological feature child recently start ticcing go develop chronic tic disorder ( include Tourette syndrome ) . Hypotheses derive primarily study patient establish tic disorder . Aim 1 : Apply functional connectivity analysis , fMRI , structural MRI , clinical , neuropsychological method first-ever pathophysiological study `` pre-Tourette '' population . The goal address whether marker previously associate chronic TS predict advance child recent-onset tic progress Tourette syndrome . Aim 2 : Generate preliminary data adequately power future study . Follow-up 3 12 month enable preliminary comparison child whose tic remit compare whose . Clinical neuropsychological variable may predict poor long-term outcome child tic . Additionally collect DNA sample subject future genetic analysis large enough sample ; prior study examine subject establish tic disorder , i.e . tic onset tic persistence , whereas opportunity data set examine genetic predictor specifically tic persistence vs. disappearance .</detailed_description>
