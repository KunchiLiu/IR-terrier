	<brief_title>Assessment Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine Intermittent Preventive Treatment Malaria Pregnancy Malawi</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria infection pregnancy associate severe maternal anemia , placental parasitemia , low birth weight , increase perinatal mortality . Intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy ( IPTp ) sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) reduce risk associate malaria pregnancy . Traditionally , level SP resistance assess monitor vivo efficacy treatment uncomplicated malaria child five year age . However , parasite resistance SP compromise efficacy young child , SP longer first-line recommended treatment malaria African country . Although SP currently appear remain effective IPTp pregnant woman probably immunity young child , important monitor SP effectiveness population . Characterizing SP resistance vivo molecular method pregnant woman may useful predict whether continue policy IPTp SP . There three part study . To determine therapeutic efficacy SP IPTp pregnant woman , prospective vivo study do woman present antenatal care ( ANC ) . Women receive SP IPTp accord national guideline follow 42 day clearance peripheral parasitemia . To determine birth outcome woman give SP IPTp , retrospective cohort study perform assess outcome woman delivery . Information prior receipt SP IPTp , peripheral placental parasitemia delivery , placental histology , maternal anemia , birth weight collect . To characterize baseline resistance SP pregnant woman general population , parasite collect participate woman attendee outpatient clinic measure SP resistance marker . The result study use Malawi national control program evaluate current policy use SP IPTp . This study also contribute towards international effort lead WHO align priority methodology gather data efficacy SP IPTp face increase SP resistance , thus provide data inform IPTp policy global level .</detailed_description>
