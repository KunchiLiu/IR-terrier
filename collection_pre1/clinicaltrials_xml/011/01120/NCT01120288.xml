	<brief_summary>Background : - A protein call HIF believe involved forming cancer help grow form . EZN-2968 new type cancer drug go cancer cell switch production HIF protein . Researchers interested test EZN-2968 people liver cancer study show drug travel liver stays drug give vein . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness EZN-2968 liver cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose liver cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants initial screen visit physical examination , blood urine test , image study assess tumor size . Tumor biopsy may also take research purpose . - Participants undefined number 6-week treatment cycle EZN-2968 , give week 3 week follow 3 week without drug . - During cycle , participant additional blood test image scan assess tumor response treatment . - Cycles treatment EZN-2968 may continue treatment effective , illness require participant stop take study drug , participant chooses withdraw study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study EZN-2968 , Antisense Oligonucleotide Inhibitor HIF-1alpha , Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors With Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) facilitate adaptation normal tumor tissue oxygen deprivation . HIF-1 frequently overexpressed cancer cell , involve upregulation many gene product essential invasion , migration , angiogenesis , survival , include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Blocking HIF-1 activity inhibits expression VEGF , result inhibition tumor growth vitro vivo . - EZN-2968 antisense oligonucleotide specifically target HIF-1 alpha , one subunits HIF-1 . Safety preliminary suggestion activity demonstrate two Phase I trials ; one patient hepatocellular carcinoma , one renal cell cancer , one angiosarcoma face treat EZN-2968 objective evidence shrinkage large mass . In vivo data show evidence intracellular uptake EZN-2968 tumor cell , Phase I trial , preliminary data show eleven patient prolong stable disease ( &gt; 90 day duration study ) , three objective evidence tumor shrinkage , thus demonstrate proof principle approach . Primary Objective : - Determine modulation HIF-1alpha mRNA tumor biopsy pre- post-administration EZN-2968 . Secondary Objectives : - Assess safety EZN-2968 patient advance solid tumor . - Determine modulation HIF-1 alpha protein level tumor biopsies pre- post-administration EZN-2968 . - Evaluate anti-tumor response determine RECIST . - Evaluate expression HIF-1 alpha target gene real-time PCR tumor biopsy . - Assess tumor angiogenesis use DCE-MRI . Eligibility : - Adult patient histologically cytologically confirm solid malignancy include study . - Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection . - Patients must fail least one line prior therapy metastatic disease disease standard curative therapy exists . - Lesion must amenable biopsy . Design : - EZN-2968 administered 2-hour IV infusion dose 18 mg/kg week 3 consecutive week follow 3-week period without drug . Each cycle 6 week , i.e. , 3 week therapy follow 3 week without drug . - Tumor biopsy correlative image pharmacodynamic study perform baseline third dose . Tumor restaging perform every 2 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis solid tumor . The diagnosis confirm Laboratory Pathology , NIH . Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection . Disease must amenable biopsy , patient must willing undergo tumor biopsy . Patients must fail least one line prior therapy metastatic disease disease standard curative therapy exists . Prior antiangiogenic therapy allow . Age ( Bullet ) 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use EZN2968 patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric trial , applicable . Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky ( Bullet ) 60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ( Bullet ) 1,500/mcL platelet ( Bullet ) 100,000/mcL total bilirubin 1.5 X ULN AST/ALT 2.5 X institutional ULN creatinine less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance ( measure ) great equal 60 mL/minute patient creatinine level &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal INR 1.4 PTT 40 second unless due lupus anticoagulant Urine protein screen urine analysis urine protein : creatinine ( UPC ) ratio . For UPC ratio &gt; 1 , 24hour urine protein obtain level &lt; 500 mg patient enrollment . The effect EZN2968 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence ; female use hormonal method , barrier method birth control ; male use condom ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 6 month completion study . Because risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother EZN 2968 , breastfeed discontinue patient trial 30 day completion treatment trial . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Willingness undergo tumor biopsy research purpose . Exclusion Criteria Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event eligibility level ( performance status laboratory criterion outline ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent ( ) part Phase 0 study ( also refer early Phase I study prePhase I study subtherapeutic dose drug administer ) PI 's discretion , 2 week prior study entry . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients active brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable ( Bullet ) 3 month treatment brain metastasis without steroid antiseizure medication may enrol discretion principal investigator . Patients require therapeutic anticoagulation . Hypertension control medical therapy ( hypertension define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management ) . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition EZN2968 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . A history hepatitis allow , follow consultation Liver Diseases Branch , felt clinically stable . Pregnant woman exclude study EZN2968 potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother EZN2968 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated EZN2968 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction EZN2968 . Patients surgical nonhealing wound . Patients nonhealing wound evaluate include PI discretion consider minor .</criteria>
