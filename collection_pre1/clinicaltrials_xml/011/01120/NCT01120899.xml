	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluation Minocycline Microglia Inhibitor Treatment Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) one lead cause blindness United States . A frequent manifestation diabetic retinopathy diabetic macular edema ( DME ) proven treatment laser photocoagulation . In retina , microglia capable migrate retina site inflammation associate closely neurons vasculature , key cellular player mediation process chronic inflammation implicate DME . For reason , microglia represent promise cellular target form therapy limit deleterious inflammatory change find DR . The objective study investigate safety efficacy minocycline microglia inhibitor patient DME . Study Population : Eligibility criterion include previous treatment standard-of-care focal laser photocoagulation , macular edema amenable focal laser treatment ; retinal thickness central subfield &gt; 250 micron measure optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) ; visual acuity 20/32 20/200 study eye . Design : Five participant initially enrol open-label pilot study . However , additional three participant may enrol account participant withdraw study prior receipt six month study treatment . Participants take oral dose 100 mg minocycline twice daily 24 month . During visit , participant visual acuity measure undergo OCT test measure retinal thickness . Beginning Month 6 visit , participant eligible focal laser therapy unless show mark improvement retinal thickness and/or visual acuity amenable focal laser treatment . Participants meet criterion improvement also eligible anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) treatment bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) . Additionally , begin Month 4 visit , participant assess worsen disease define loss ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter vision compare baseline ≥ 50 % increase total retinal thickness measure OCT . Participants deem worsen disease also eligible focal laser and/or anti-VEGF treatment . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) study eye 6 month compare baseline . Secondary outcome include change retinal thickness measure OCT 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , change BCVA 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline , well change fluid leakage macula demonstrate fluorescein angiography 6 , 12 , 18 24 month compare baseline . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity , adverse event .</detailed_description>

Participant must agree minimize exposure sunlight artificial UV ray wear protective clothing , sunglasses sunscreen [ minimum Sun Protection Factor ( SPF ) 15 ] s/he must sun . 10 . Participant least one eye meet study eye criterion list . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Participant another investigational study actively receive study therapy . 2 . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . 3 . Participant know hypersensitivity sodium fluorescein dye . 4 . Participant condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . • Patients poor glycemic control , within last four month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next four month enrol . 5 . Participant history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 6 . Participant history hepatitis liver failure . 7 .

Participant blood pressure &gt; 180/110 ( systolic 180 OR diastolic 110 ) . • If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , patient become eligible . 10 . Participant history treatment systemic antivascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) agent steroid within three month prior study entry . 11 . Participant history thyroid cancer . Study Eye Inclusion Criteria 1 . Bestcorrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity score 78 39 letter ( i.e. , 20/32 20/200 ) . 2 . Definite retinal thickening due diabetic macular edema base clinical exam involve center macula refractory therapy base investigator 's clinical judgment . 3 . Previous treatment focal laser photocoagulation follow standardofcare/best practice guideline , describe ETDRS study,6 ≥ 3 month prior enrollment unless edema responsive previous laser and/or amenable safe laser treatment discretion investigator . The laser treatment may perform National Eye Institute ( NEI ) clinical center ( CC ) outside ophthalmologist discretion participant investigator . 4 . Retinal thickness central subfield baseline optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measurement &gt; 250 micron , measure Spectral OCT. 5 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation patient cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria 1 . Macular edema consider due cause diabetic macular edema . An eye consider eligible : The macular edema consider related cataract extraction Clinical exam and/or OCT suggest vitreoretinal interface disease ( e.g. , taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) primary cause macular edema . 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion investigator , visual acuity would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigmentary change , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition ) . 3 . An ocular condition present ( diabetic retinopathy ) , opinion investigator , might affect macular edema alter visual acuity course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , IrvineGass Syndrome , etc. ) . 4 . Substantial cataract , opinion investigator , likely decrease visual acuity three line ( i.e. , cataract would reduce acuity 20/40 bad eye otherwise normal ) . 5 .
