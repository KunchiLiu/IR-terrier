	<brief_summary>This study investigate isolate associated effect estrogen therapy physical exercise function , regulation cardiovascular risk marker 60 postmenopausal woman , ( 45 - 60 year old ) . The volunteer randomaized two group : estrogen therapy ( estradiol valerate 1 mg/day oraly ) placebo . The two group randomaized two subgroup : exercise group ( aerobic trainning , cicle-ergometre , 50 minute , 3 x week ) sedentary group . At 0 , 6 12 month volunteer submit : clinical analise , cardiorespiratory analise ( ergoepirometric test ) , quality life questionare ( Short Form-36 [ SF-36 ] ) , ambulatory blood pressure monitor 24 hour 2 experimental session cardiovascular response insulin action ( euglicemic/hiperinsulinemic clamp ) physical mental stress ( microneurography ) access . Besides , volunteer sedentary group submit extra session 6 month study evaluate physiological answer insulin infusion acute session exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>More isolated event , menopause universal process produce many physiologic change , affect reproductive tissue system woman 's body . Post-menopause period usually accompanied increase climacteric symptom , decrease healthy relate quality life . Moreover , many unhealthy change occur period woman 's life , increase risk metabolic syndrome development , might due , least part , increase insulin resistance compensatory hyperinsulinemia . Hormone therapy indicate main treatment reduce relief negative effect menopause . Although many study confirm possible positive effect approach postmenopausal symptom , effect insulin resistance metabolic syndrome factor remain controversial . On hand , 's well know acute chronic exercise provide wide range benefit postmenopausal woman 's health , include decrease insulin resistance symptom relief . In clinical practice , many postmenopausal woman use hormone therapy instruct exercise . However , effect association poorly study . Thus , main goal randomize placebo-controlled trial evaluate , healthy , middle age , hysterectomized postmenopausal woman , single combine effect physical exercise oral estrogen use blood pressure ( BP ) , heart rate ( HR ) , muscle blood flow , autonomic function measure baseline condition hyperinsulinemia stimulus . Moreover , also investigated effect intervention symptom relief quality life .</detailed_description>
