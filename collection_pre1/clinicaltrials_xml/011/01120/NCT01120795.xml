	<brief_title>Pegylated Interferon Ribavirin Hepatitis C Patients Opioid Pharmacotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate excess 170 million people worldwide infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) result 1.4 million death annually . In developed country HCV commonly transmit inject drug use ( IDU ) estimate suggest 80-90 % incident case due unsafe injecting practice . Infection result chronic infection around 75 % case patient subsequently develop life-threatening complication liver failure hepatocellular carcinoma due progressive fibrosis . Current standard care consist combination pegylated interferon ribavirin result sustain virological response rate ( SVR , define undetectable HCV RNA 24 week post treatment ) 54-63 % patient . This strongly dependent viral genotype genotype 1 patient achieve low SVR rate compare genotype 2 3 . These therapy however associate significant side effect , notably psychiatric . Depression , anxiety irritability common concern attendant risk suicidality patient chronic illness depression particularly common . Mood disorder report occur 50 % patient therapy result dose reduction discontinuation 40 % 20 % patient respectively . While effective therapy become available treatment chronic HCV , largely utilised patient actively inject . This due concern potential poor adherence treatment regimen , reinfection due ongoing IDU , increase incidence concomitant alcohol abuse , potential increase side effect ( especially psychiatric ) , concern pregnancy ribavirin use due non-adherence contraception well active discrimination practitioner . There however considerable potential advantage include : improvement health infect individual , potential decreasing burden disease community attendant cost well potential impact transmission inherent potential public health benefit . This multicentre study conduct determine response rate well AE profile psychiatric impact therapy population chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) receive opiate pharmacotherapy , many still inject .</detailed_description>
