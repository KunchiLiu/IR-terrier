	<brief_title>Gamma-Secretase/Notch Signalling Pathway Inhibitor RO4929097 Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess six-month progression-free survival one-year overall survival probability Stage IV melanoma patient treat RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate preliminary manner relationship Notch activation status gene expression profile tumor clinical outcome patient study . II . To study effect investigational therapy T cell function , provide basis subsequent trial combine Notch blockade immunomodulatory therapy advance melanoma . III . To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed complete partial response ) . IV . To assess toxicity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo blood collection baseline study analysis T-cell function flow cytometry ELISA . Tumor tissue sample biopsy surgery also analyze Notch activation IHC qRT-PCR . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
