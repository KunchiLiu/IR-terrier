	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Tamibarotene ( OAM80 ) Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tamibarotene synthetic retinoid presently approve Japan treatment APL , high receptor selectivity activity Retinoic Acid Receptor subtypes compare natural retinoid . Tamibarotene decrease insoluble amyloid-beta ( Ab ) 42 deposition APP mouse , also increase TTR , VAChT ACh brain SAMP8 mouse , suggest enhancement neurotransmission . In behavioral model reduce anxiety SAMP8 mouse rat passive avoidance test , tamibarotene show improvement . Tamibarotene retinoids know moderate immune system reduce inflammatory cytokine chemokines , may control excessive stimulation astrocyte microglia around Ab plaque . Tamibarotene reduce cytokine show clinical efficacy rat experimental autoimmune encephalitis model . Furthermore , retinoids know critical role regeneration stage differentiation neural stem cell ( NSC ) . In spinal cord injure rat treat tamibarotene show good recovery compare control . By preclinical result , plan study evaluate efficacy together safety tamibarotene patient Alzheimer 's Disease . Tamibarotene use clinically Japan since 2005 . It 's side effect know similar clinically used retinoids .</detailed_description>
