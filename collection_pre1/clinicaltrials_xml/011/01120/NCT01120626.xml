	<brief_summary>Fragile X syndrome ( FraX ) common know heritable cause human intellectual disability . Though recent research reveal much genetic neurobiological base FraX , knowledge specific effective treatment affect individual lack . Based information human animal study , one cause intellectual disability FraX may relate deficit particular brain neurotransmitter system ( `` cholinergic '' system ) . Thus , investigator propose use specific medication , donepezil , augment cholinergic system adolescent affect FraX . If find effective , knowledge generate research may also relevant developmental disorder share common disease pathway FraX .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fragile X syndrome ( FraX ) , neurodevelopmental disorder cause mutation FMR1 gene , common know heritable cause cognitive behavioral disability human . Though research progress pertain FraX extraordinary many area , many critical gap knowledge remain . In particular , dearth information treatment design address often-serious cognitive behavioral symptom FraX . Like many developmental disorder , description treatment FraX exist literature primarily derive uncontrolled case study series , pharmacological behavioral intervention target symptom associate phenomenologically define `` co-morbid '' diagnosis AD/HD , autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) anxiety disorder . These circumstance suboptimal symptom-based treatment represent low level specificity respect underlie pathogenesis cognitive behavioral problem . Accordingly , new research develop effective , disease-specific treatment person FraX greatly need . Converging evidence research group others strongly support hypothesis functional cholinergic deficit contribute cognitive-behavioral dysfunction FraX . This evidence include : ( 1 ) abnormality cholinergic pathway function neurochemistry observe functional MRI 1H-MRS , respectively , FraX , ( 2 ) analysis FMR1 expression human fetal development indicate particularly high expression cholinergic brain region , ( 3 ) cholinergic system abnormality detect mouse fly model FraX , ( 4 ) analysis specific profile cognitive behavioral deficit FraX relation current knowledge cholinergic system function , , ( 5 ) significant improvement cognition behavior observe 12 individual FraX open-label trial donepezil , cholinesterase inhibitor . Accordingly , propose project consist double blind , placebo control trial donepezil 50 individual FraX , age 12 29 year . The primary hypothesis subject receive donepezil show great improvement specific measure behavior cognition , relative placebo group . In addition direct benefit person affect FraX , finding propose research likely highly relevant subgroup ( currently ) idiopathic developmental disorder , autism , might share common pathophysiological mechanism disease FraX . Such share mechanism could occur intersect pathway involve FMR1 protein function result similarity contribution cholinergic dysfunction cognitive behavioral disability .</detailed_description>
