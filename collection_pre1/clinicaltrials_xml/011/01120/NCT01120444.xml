	<brief_title>Study Effects Blood Glucose Following Intradermal Subcutaneous Dosing Insulin Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient participate 10 visit first , Visit 1 , Screening Visit . Visit 2 consist brief isoglycemic clamp single IV insulin challenge determine insulin sensitivity . A subsequent test meal single SC insulin dose ( clamp ) do determine nominal coverage dose insulin mixed meal contain 60g carbohydrate . This nominal dose form basis insulin bolus dose remainder study visit . For Visits 3-9 , patient come institute early morning 24 hour prior meal test application Continuous Glucose Monitor ( Dexcom Seven Plus™ , Dexcom , INC ) . Subjects receive standardized meal day blood glucose stabilized overnight concentration 115±15 mg/dL via IV insulin and/or glucose infusion . The next morning subject start experimental intervention . Immediately prior standardize meal ( 2 minute eat ) patient receive insulin either ID SC route , follow breakfast ( rapidly absorb carb ) meal time point T0 . Meal consumption occur 10 15 min time interval . Blood glucose excursion observe 6 hour thereafter ( T= 360 min ) . Between hour 6 7 , BG may re-stabilized start value ( 115±15 mg/dL ) administration IV insulin glucose necessary . At time second insulin injection ( dose time point T= -2 minute ) give second standardize lunch ( mixed ) meal administer . Blood glucose excursion follow additional 6 hour thereafter ( T = 780 minute ) Conditions Visits 3-8 : - Condition 1 . Individualized Lispro ID dose ( nominal dose base prior insulin sensitivity test patient-specific insulin-to-carb ratio ) give immediately ( 2min ) prior breakfast meal contain predominantly rapidly absorb carbohydrate ( std 60 g CHO ; approximately 70:15:15 CHO : protein : fat ) ; second lunch mixed meal give 7 hour later contain total number carbohydrate ( std 60 g mixed ) mixed composition carbohydrate , protein , fat ( ratio approximately 35:25:40 ) . - Condition 2 . Equivalent insulin dose meal regimen Condition 1 give SC route . - Conditions 3 4 . The meal regimen Condition 1 , ID SC dose increase 30 % nominal dose simulate inappropriate carb counting . - Conditions 5 6 . The meal regimen Condition 1 , ID SC dose decrease 30 % nominal dose simulate inappropriate carb counting . In addition meal challenge subject maintain Animas pump intradermally deliver combine bolus basal profile placebo ( 5 % dextrose injection solution ) study period evaluate flow biomechanics . Visit 9 examine single earlier dose timing ( determined analysis glycemic profile dataset prior 8 visit ) relative two meal ID route , use optimal target dose condition 1 2 . Patients final examination , Visit 10 , immediately follow Visit 9 .</detailed_description>
