	<brief_title>Prevention Trial Assessing Paper-Tape Endurance Distances ( PreTAPED )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants approximately 100 ultra-endurance athlete compete Racing Planet 's 250 mile/7 day 4 Desert ultra-endurance race . A convenience sample use , full consent sign inclusion study , participant inform study inclusion entirely optional affect medical care . A foot berandomly select participant , coin flip determine foot tap , head - right foot , tail , leave foot . The non-taped foot use control . No preventive treatment apply control foot . The runner 's normal sock/shoe system use reflect natural wilderness condition . Runners exclude blister , broken blister , hot spot present either foot time initial tap determined visual foot inspection study administrator . The participant also exclude pre-existing blistering condition know sensitivity paper tape . Participants demographic data collect prior race , include age , gender , country origin , number marathon run prior , pack weight , sock type . The study endpoint occur hot spot blister develop either treat untreated foot . Runners instruct treat suspected blister hot spot normally would , inform study administrator day visual inspection final questionnaire determine develop blister hot spot , whether apply re-applied tape , remove tape , reason action . Participants allow experimental taped foot re-taped physician point race deem necessary runner . Before apply tape , visual inspection determine foot clean dirt hot spot blister / broken blister present . Tape apply trained study physician . One inch micropore paper tape 3M apply toe follow manner . A piece tape place toe longitudinally base phalanx dorsally base phalanx plantar side . The tape smooth skin . Any tape extend beyond tip phalanx adhere together . A second piece one inch paper tape apply circumferentially around toe , end tape locate dorsum toe . In manner , five toe experimental foot tap . Any `` dog ear '' ( tape extend beyond phalanx ) trim scissors . One 2 inch piece micropore paper tape apply horizontally posterior heel Achilles tendon , extend posterior medial malleolus posterior lateral malleolus . One 2 inch piece micropore tape apply perpendicular head 5th metatarsal , another perpendicular 1st metatarsal cover medial well plantar aspect .</detailed_description>
