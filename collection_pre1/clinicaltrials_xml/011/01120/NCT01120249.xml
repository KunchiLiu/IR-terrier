	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase III trial study everolimus see well work treat patient kidney cancer undergone surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0931 , Everolimus Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - compare recurrence-free survival renal carcinoma patient randomly assign 54 week everolimus versus 54 week placebo nephrectomy partial nephrectomy . Secondary - To compare overall survival patient treat everolimus v placebo . - To compare qualitative quantitative toxicity two study arm . - To bank tissue biologic specimens future study molecular biomarkers relevant AKT/mTOR pathway implicate pathogenesis renal carcinoma investigate potential predictive prognostic value . - To bank blood specimens future study relationship steady-state trough level everolimus relevant side effect ( lymphopenia , infection , hyperglycemia , hypercholesterolemia , hypertriglyceridemia ) patient treat study everolimus . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord pathologic stage ( intermediate high-risk v high-risk ) , histologic subtype ( clear cell v non-clear cell ) , performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral everolimus daily day 1-42 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily day 1-42 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Archived tumor tissue , plasma , whole blood sample may collect periodically biomarker analysis translational study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 8 year .</detailed_description>
