	<brief_summary>This study offer patient castrate-resistant ( also know hormone-refractory ) prostate cancer . The cancer metastasize spread outside prostate area part body recur pelvic area treatment . The purpose clinical research study determine whether OGX-427 able slow progression prostate cancer symptom disease give prednisone well prednisone give alone patient prostate cancer whose disease spread outside prostate area . Research Hypothesis : That add OGX-427 prednisone treatment produce progression free rate 20 % .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OGX-427 Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common cancer diagnosed second common cause cancer death men North America . Patients metastatic disease poor prognosis , although hormonal therapy form medical surgical castration induce significant long-term remission , development androgen independent disease inevitable . The current standard care CRPC mainly palliative intent , limit proven treatment option include : analgesia , radiation , bisphosphonates chemotherapy mitoxantrone docetaxel , last treatment associate overall survival benefit . With early commencement androgen deprivation therapy frequent use PSA monitoring disease progression , increase population patient CRPC identify rise PSA rather new disease symptom . Early intervention chemotherapy unknown benefit patient , thus represent appropriate group phase II study evaluate novel agent acceptable toxicity profile . Heat shock protein ( Hsp ) family member , include Hsp27 , attract attention new therapeutic target cancer . Hsp27 small , ATP-independent Hsp highly conserve across specie . Hsp27 express prostate cancer malignancy . Expression Hsp27 induce cell stress , include cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation therapy , hormone therapy . Overexpression Hsp27 confers resistant phenotype implicate castration resistant progression prostate cancer . OGX 427 second generation antisense oligonucleotide ( ASO ) inhibit expression Hsp27 . A number vitro vivo pharmacological study demonstrate OGX 427 ( Hsp27 ASO ) single-agent activity reduce Hsp27 mRNA protein , inhibit cell proliferation , induce apoptosis several human cancer cell line . OGX 427 also demonstrate chemosensitizing activity vitro vivo combination several cytotoxic drug , include docetaxel . In ongoing Phase I trial , OGX-427 administer single agent dose 200 1000 mg weekly infusion occur load dose period three infusion within first 10 day initiate treatment . OGX-427 treatment well tolerate , majority adverse event laboratory toxicity report Grade 1 Grade 2 , although symptom complex rigor , pruritus , erythema shortly infusion drug require steroid prophylaxis and/or treatment patient higher dos . No maximum tolerate dose identify base toxicity . OGX 427 administration combination docetaxel ongoing above-mentioned Phase 1 study . Low dose corticosteroid show activity prostate cancer beneficial effect quality life ( QOL ) . Since chemotherapy prostate cancer palliative , low-dose prednisone use single agent add chemotherapy regimen . This Phase 2 study design evaluate anti-tumor effect OGX-427 plus low-dose prednisone versus low-dose prednisone alone men CRPC previously receive chemotherapy metastatic locally recurrent disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Age ≥ 18 year date consent . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Histological cytological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . Metastatic disease chest , abdominal , pelvic CT and/or bone scan curative therapy exists . Progression prostate cancer . Progression define one following : 1 . Increasing serum PSA level : two consecutive increase PSA level document previous reference value obtain least one week apart . If third PSA value less second , additional fourth test confirm rise PSA acceptable . The last confirmation PSA value must obtain within 14 day prior randomization . A minimum start value 2.0 ng/mL require study randomization . 2 . Progressive measurable disease : least 20 % increase sum diameter measurable lesion small sum observe appearance one new lesion assess CT scan . Measurable lesion nodal visceral softtissue lesion nodal lesion ≥ 15 mm diameter shortest axis visceral/softtissue lesion ≥ 10 mm long diameter ( See Section 6.4 ) . 3 . Bone Progression : appearance 2 new lesion bone scan ( image ) . All patient surgical orchiectomy must continue treatment LHRH agonist antagonist maintain castrate level testosterone . Patient must fulfill `` Prior Therapy '' criterion follow : 1 . Chemotherapy : No prior chemotherapy metastatic disease permissible . ( Exception : neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy receive &gt; 12 month prior randomization . ) 2 . Hormone therapy : prior surgical medical castration therapy require . Prior treatment nonsteroidal antiandrogens , abiraterone experimental hormone therapy ( e.g . MDV3100 , YAK700 ) allow provide minimum least 14 day pass since complete therapy randomization study . 3 . Experimental therapy : prior noncytotoxic experimental therapy permit provided minimum least 14 day pass since complete therapy prior randomization . 4 . Radiation : prior external beam radiation permit provided minimum least 28 day pass since complete radiotherapy time randomization ( follow disease progression prior receive therapy time crossover ) . Exception radiotherapy : least 7 day must pass since complete single fraction ≤ 800 cGy . 5 . Corticosteroids : prior corticosteroid therapy permit . Within 4 day follow randomization , patient must take prednisone 5 mg BID . Baseline laboratory value state : 1 . ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109 cell /L , platelet count ≥ .100 x 109 /L , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL without transfusion . 2 . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 3 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.1 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease ) . 4 . SGPT ( ALT ) SGOT ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN . 5 . Castrate serum testosterone level ( &lt; 50 ng/dLor &lt; 1.7 nmol/L ) . Recovery toxicity prior therapy ≤ grade 2 NCI CTCAE , version 3.0 . ( Exception : toxicity view Investigator clinically significant safety risk therapy administration , include , limited : anemia , fatigue , erectile dysfunction , hot flash , lymphedema extremity , dizziness , cough , urinary incontinence ) . Must willing use effective contraception , child bear potential , throughout study treatment 3 month completion study treatment . Must willing change ( add subtract ) bone protect therapy ( bisphosphonates and/or denosumab ) study unless change toxicity . Written informed consent must obtain prior protocolspecific procedure perform . Exclusion Criteria Unable tolerate dose 10 mg prednisone day . Requiring amount opioids control pain &gt; 30 mg morphineequivalent per day . Known coagulopathy actively receive warfarin ( Coumadin ) therapy . Documented brain metastasis , carcinomatous meningitis , treat untreated ( Brain image asymptomatic patient require ) . Current symptomatic cord compression require surgery radiation therapy ( successfully treat progression , patient eligible study ) . Active second malignancy ( except adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer solid tumor curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 3 year ) . History allergic reaction therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides . Uncontrolled medical condition heart failure , myocardial infarction , uncontrolled hypertension , stroke treatment major active infection within 3 month randomization , well significant concurrent medical illness opinion Investigator would preclude protocol therapy . Planned concomitant participation another clinical trial experimental agent , vaccine , device . Concomitant participation observational study acceptable .</criteria>
