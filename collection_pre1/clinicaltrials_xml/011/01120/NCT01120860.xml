	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Decline Aging Aviator Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We expect MRI MRSI technique useful adjunct research effort understand individual difference performance complex attention-demanding task , fly plane driving car . Other predictor change performance complex task may include simple test process speed work memory , past training recent practice task , genetic risk factor degenerative brain disease . In project , examine whether baseline MR measure useful longitudinal MR measure predict amount change time task performance . This research part long-term effort achieve earlier identification individual risk decline ultimately minimize loss function .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subjects include participate protocol `` AgeRelated Longitudinal Changes Aviator Performance '' agree participate protocol . Subjects exclude currently major neurological disease , unstable/untreated medical disease ( untreated hypertension ) . In consideration magnetic field subject place MR scanning , also exclude subject unable safely comfortably complete scan session . This include individual wear metal prosthesis cardiac pacemaker nonremovable metal object . Subjects report history severe claustrophobia poorly control back pain exclude unlikely could comfortably remain still MRI scanner duration scan . In addition , subject fit apparatus also exclude .</criteria>
