	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study bicalutamide , goserelin , leuprolide acetate see well work give without cixutumumab treat patient newly diagnose metastatic prostate cancer . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , bicalutamide , goserelin , leuprolide acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether bicalutamide , goserelin , leuprolide acetate effective give without cixutumumab treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bicalutamide Goserelin Leuprolide Acetate With Without Cixutumumab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare undetectable prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) rate ( PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL ) seven cycle ( 28 week ) protocol treatment randomize luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist bicalutamide randomize LHRH agonist , bicalutamide IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination IMC-A12 LHRH agonist bicalutamide . II . To compare proportion men achieve PSA &lt; 4 ng/mL two group . III . To assess accuracy prognostic model undetectable PSA develop Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) -9346 use current trial data arm . IV . To assess serum sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMNC ) pharmacodynamic activity potential biomarkers IMC-A12 ( include , limited : insulin-like growth factor [ IGF ] -I , free IGF-I , IGF-II , IGF bind protein [ IGFBP ] 2 , IGFBP3 , growth hormone , insulin C-peptide ) obtain optional blood specimen initiation androgen deprivation therapy twelve week initiation combine therapy . V. To determine baseline pre-treatment circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) quantities response therapy ( patient detectable CTC level &gt; = 1 ) twelve week later . VI . In subset patient CTC level obtain , determine baseline serum level micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNAs ) include limited microRNA ( mi ) -141 initiation androgen deprivation therapy twelve week combine therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprise bicalutamide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 either goserelin acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) leuprolide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) every 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 12 month . Patients also receive cixutumumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive androgen deprivation therapy comprise bicalutamide either goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>
