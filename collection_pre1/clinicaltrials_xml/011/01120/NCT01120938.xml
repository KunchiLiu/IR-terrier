	<brief_summary>Sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) lead cause death among infant 1 month 1 year age develop world . SIDS continue phenomenon unknown cause . The best approach prevention high risk infant unclear . Several substantial line evidence indicate pacifier protective effect incidence SIDS . These study significantly power result consistent world-wide . The explanation protective effect pacifier SIDS prevalence unclear . A recent case report New Zealand show mean nasopharyngeal film baby without pacifier possibility suck pacifier associate forward movement tongue enlargement upper airway ' cross sectional area . Indeed , hypothesis originally postulate 30 year ago Cozzi et al . Working hypothesis aim : Our hypothesis since upper respiratory tract portion airway impose great resistance ventilation , suck pacifier result upper airway dilatation , thus greatly reduce upper airway obstruction improve ventilation stage infant virtually obligate nasal breather . It stress airway resistance proportional 3rd power radius airway , thus even relatively small increase airway diameter may profound effect airway resistance respiratory mechanical work breathing ! In young infant underdeveloped respiratory center drive , decrease work breathing could certainly sufficient minimize risk SIDS describe above.Thus , aim study demonstrate effect suck pacifier upper airway patency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ten 12 infant ' parent refer clinical examination MR ( CT without contrast ) brain neck require sedation perform examination ask participate study . These infant represent potentially ideal population study upper airway . They already undergo MR/CT , upper airway image record , asleep , typically airway abnormality . In child , 2 image upper airway -one obtain one obtain without pacifier -will analyze compare . In case additional sedation give obtain MR/CT image airway . If patient begin wake investigational sequence , sequence abort . To test hypothesis use functional method , compare LRT aerosol penetration without pacifier . Infants regular pacifier user receive therapeutic aerosol regularly ( e.g. , ventolin , budicort ) study . Labeling aerosol particle gamma emit isotope marker quantify deposition scintigraphically mean gamma camera simple , safe commonly use method ass aerosol deposition throughout URT LRT .</detailed_description>
