	<detailed_description>Brain injury often result disruption attentional regulation process , reduces efficiency effectiveness cognitive function include learning , memory , problem-solving goal management , lead significant functional disability . Despite importance problem , effective intervention available . Current project involve develop novel theory-driven neural biomarkers behavioral measurement tool train intervention target attentional control process . The collection result help delineate neural mechanism support improve attention regulation may serve neurobiological target development novel intervention enhance benefit rehabilitation . In randomized , control intervention study design , individual traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) chronic executive control dysfunction participate experimental comparison intervention match time , pre- post-intervention measurement performance neurocognitive 'challenge ' test assess target non-targeted domain , functional performance low structure 'real-world ' setting , functional MRI measurement assess goal-directed information processing . The intervention : Goal-Based Self Management ( GBSM ) training , pair comparison intervention Brain Health Education ( EDU ) ; Pathfinder Attention Process Training ( PATH ) , pair comparison intervention Brain Health Education Motor Skills Training ( EDU/MOTOR ) , Tonic Phasic Alertness Training ( TAPAT ) pair comparison intervention Object Discrimination Training ( ODT ) . Participants assign GBSM start EDU GBSM . Assignment perform pseudo-randomized basis pairing individual assignment process ensure group closely match age , sex , education level baseline cognitive status . Post-training assessment occur week 5 . Those enter EDU cross-over GBSM , enter GBSM 5 week self-driven practice . There cross-over GBSM EDU order well assess potential maintenance effect GBSM participation well reduce overall time commitment patient trainer give time-intensive nature EDU intervention . Both group participate longitudinal assessment week 10 . Long-term follow-up 6 month . Subjects assign PATH EDU/MOTOR intervention randomize one two group . The EDU/MOTOR group participate brain health education motor speed computer game ; PATH group enter integrate protocol involve goal-directed attention regulation train computer-assisted practice . Both group participate Assessment 2 first study period . All subject EDU/MOTOR group offer entrance PATH completion first study period , provide additional within-subjects comparison effect . Subjects undergo fMRI , neuropsychological functional assessment baseline , week 6 , week 12 6 month . Finally , examine effectiveness TAPAT intervention , subject assign either TAPAT ODT . TAPAT design improve alertness two level : tonic attention sustain attention phasic alertness , capacity rapidly effectively interrupt ongoing response pattern . Subjects present object computer screen make speed response via button press non-targeted object withhold button press target object . ODT use stimulus stimulus delivery parameter TAPAT consist stimulus discrimination task subject require discriminate object category , use unspeeded , forced-choice format . TAPAT ODT subject undergo fMRI , neuropsychological functional assessment baseline , week 6 , week 12 .</detailed_description>
