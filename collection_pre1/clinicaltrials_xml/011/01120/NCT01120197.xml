	<detailed_description>Public health policy European country concern keep old people live independently qualitatively good life community long possible . Apart personal human cost , osteoporosis major public health problem , enormous social economic impact . Osteoporosis ( OP ) common condition among old people , non-fatal condition lead change quality life change length life . Osteoporosis skeletal disorder characterize decreased bone mass . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) Study Group Osteoporosis define osteoporosis `` hip BMD level 2.5 SDs mean BMD young , white , adult woman '' . Using WHO definition , approximately 30 % postmenopausal woman osteoporosis . The common consequence osteoporosis fracture . Furthermore common condition associate osteoporosis back pain , limitation physical functioning , psychosocial impairment . Thus , purpose study record effect programme mobility , balance , disease-specific generic health-related quality life woman osteoporosis history vertebral fracture . The programme consist three-hour educational session three-month course exercise accordance guideline woman increase risk fall postmenopausal osteoporotic woman history fracture . Our hypothesis three-month course exercise three-hour lesson cope osteoporosis significantly positive effect generic disease-specific quality life , well balance mobility , elderly ( â‰¥60 year ) woman postmenopausal osteoporosis history vertebral fracture , 3 month intervention one year . The sample would recruit Osteoporosis Outpatient clinic Ostfold Hospital , Norway body mineral density ( BMD ) measure use Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) . The design study randomize control trial sample would randomize intervention group control group . Subjects control group ask maintain current lifestyle . No restriction place exercise activity . Subjects intervention group must participate training course consist 24 session 3 month . The exercise include aerobic , stretch , balance functional training , i.e . circuit exercise focus : prevention fall fracture , improve balance coordination , improve posture , inform subject risk factor fall osteoporosis fracture . A 3-hour session information supervision hold intervention group physiotherapist lead training session . The focus body awareness ergonomic advice specific , daily-life situation ( e.g . lifting/carrying , rest position ) .</detailed_description>
