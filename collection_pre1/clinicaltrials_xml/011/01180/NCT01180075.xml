	<brief_summary>Purpose : To see grow old change amount HIV drug blood HIV-infected men woman . Many change happen body age may affect way drug carry blood , broken remove body . This study look amount drug blood cell immune system patient take efavirenz , tenofovir emtricitabine atazanavir boost ritonavir , tenofovir emtricitabine . Participants : The population comprise 56 ( 6 intensive PK 50 sparse sample ) HIV-infected adult currently adhere antiretroviral regimen contain efavirenz tenofovir emtricitabine number distribution HIV-infected adult currently adhere antiretroviral regimen contain atazanavir boost ritonavir tenofovir emtricitabine . Procedures ( method ) : This study complete University North Carolina Chapel Hill . There four group subject : Efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group A , Efavirenz/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group B , Atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group A , Atazanavir/ritonavir/tenofovir/emtricitabine Group B . The initial six subject ( Group A ) intensive PK analysis regimen recruit UNC ID Clinic Moses Cone Health System Infectious Diseases Clinic , comprise non-frail subject currently receive interact drug . If subject provide informed consent , time blood sample obtain determine pharmacokinetic parameter around observe dose one two study regimen . A whole blood sample also collect stored potential drug metabolize enzyme transporter genotyping future . Group A subject complete follow-up visit sample visit . 50 subsequent subject ( Group B ) regimen screen simultaneously , 10 subject enrolled regimen Group B prior completion analysis Group A . These subject also recruit either site . Group B subject one two sample visit 1 4 blood sample obtain visit , store sample future genotyping obtain one visit . Samples collect prior dose , 2 hour , 4 6 hr , 10 14 hour medication dose . These visit may coincide subject ' regularly schedule visit clinic , schedule separately , depend preference availability subject .</brief_summary>
