	<brief_title>Intensive Vasodilator Therapy Patients With Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Morphological change observe microvasculature patient essential hypertension . The lumen diameter reduce resistance artery , change vessel cross-sectional area wall mass . These structural change term inward eutrophic remodelling result increase wall : lumen ratio , cause rearrangement cell matrix hypertrophy smooth muscle cell vascular wall observe secondary form hypertension . The morphological change also occur coronary artery cause reduction ability increase coronary perfusion response increase cardiac work . This observe reduced coronary flow reserve patient sustained hypertension . Two recently publish clinical study associate increase medium : lumen ratio increase risk cardiovascular event , therefore seem beneficial normalize vascular structure patient essential hypertension . It previously demonstrate reversion vascular remodelling thereby normalization vascular structure , require vasodilatation blood pressure reduction , suggest patient essential hypertension benefit antihypertensive treatment aim induce vasodilatation . The purpose study determine whether add-on intensive vasodilator therapy improve coronary perfusion ( coronary flow reserve ) reduce total peripheral resistance patient ongoing treatment essential hypertension . We also aim investigate whether change coronary flow reserve correlate well change total peripheral resistance change blood pressure . Particularly aim study patient high total peripheral resistance , despite blood pressure control , benefit intensive vasodilating therapy .</detailed_description>
