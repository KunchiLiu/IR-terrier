	<brief_summary>Obesity establish risk factor development progression kidney disease . Intentional weight loss people without kidney disease result improvement diabetes , blood pressure , cholesterol , cardiovascular disease overall death rate . The investigator know whether hold true patient chronic kidney disease . In propose pilot study , investigator analyze kidney function stabilize weight loss intervention obese kidney disease patient mechanisms might mediate beneficial effect . If weight loss kidney disease patient result stabilization kidney function , would provide opportunity conduct long-term prospective study analyze sustain benefit weight loss kidney disease patient . Specific aim 1 : To ascertain effect lifestyle modification bariatric surgery urinary protein excretion renal function among obese CKD patient . Hypothesis : Weight loss attain either lifestyle modification surgical intervention result lower urinary protein excretion stabilization renal function among obese CKD patient . Specific aim 2 : To identify mechanism mediates change urinary protein excretion renal function among obese CKD patient undergo lifestyle modification bariatric surgery . Hypothesis : Weight loss attain either lifestyle modification surgical intervention result amelioration endothelial dysfunction , inflammation , insulin resistance increase High Molecular Weight ( HMW ) adiponectin level mediate improvement urinary protein excretion renal function among obese CKD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In non-randomized prospective study , three different group patient enrol . Group 1 include obese chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient undergo lifestyle modification , Group 2 include obese CKD patient undergo bariatric surgery Group 3 include obese CKD patient undergo specific weight loss intervention ( control group ) . The lifestyle group undergo supervise exercise training 5 day per week follow hypocaloric diet base recommendation dietitian 12 week . The exercise training consist walking , run treadmill stationary cycling cycle ergometer . Patients undergo adipokines , marker inflammation , insulin resistance , renal function , bioimpedance analysis , DEXA measurement baseline , 3- 6-month interval . CKD patient undergo bariatric surgery control group also undergo blood test , renal function study body composition study baseline , 3- 6-month interval .</detailed_description>
