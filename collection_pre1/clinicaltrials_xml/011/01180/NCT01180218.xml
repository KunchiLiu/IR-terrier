	<brief_title>Complete Lesion Versus Culprit Lesion Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) systemic prothrombotic milieu , often involve one coronary artery , even though predominantly affect plaque rupture consequences one coronary artery territory ( culprit artery territory ) ( 1 ) . Also , Multivessel disease ( MVD ) , well know predictor poor clinical outcome occur acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) patient ( pt ) 40 % 65 % ( 2 , 3 ) . In acute STEMI , achieve maximum myocardial reperfusion salvage primary percutaneous intervention culprit lesion preferred reperfusion strategy per late ACC/AHA ESC guideline ( 4 , 5 ) . At presently consensus regard management significant non culprit lesion initial presentation hemodynamically stable STEMI pt ( 6 , 7 ) .Although multivessel revascularization seem improve myocardial reperfusion salvage limit infarct size , improve ejection fraction ( EF ) stabilize vulnerable plaque acute AMI presentation , revascularization non IRAs yield conflict result BMS era ( 2 , 7-13 ) . Balancing merit increase risk higher periprocedural MI due multivessel stent implantation non IRAs paramount importance decide revascularization strategy MVD STEMI pt ( 13-15 ) . Drug elute stent ( DES ) implantation primary PCI increase real world scenario establishment safety multiple Meta analysis randomize trial ( 16-19 ) .Even though DES reduces recurrent revascularizations acute STEMI pt , merit demerit usage treat non IRAs multivessel disease pt STEMI largely unknown modern PCI era ( 16 , 19 ) . The aim study compare clinical outcome culprit lesion revascularization ( CLR ) group complete revascularization ( CR ) group CR group include treatment IRA non IRAs ) strategy MVD STEMI pt real world scenario utilize DES . Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) establish treatment choice acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . During procedure , culprit artery recanalization allow reperfusion myocardium improve heal injure tissue ( 20 , 21 ) . Recent study show AMI setting , pathophysiology involves whole coronary artery tree ( 21 ) , nearly 40 % 65 % patient present AMI multivessel disease ( 22 ) , ( 23 ) , ( 24 ) , ( 25 ) plaque instability might develop multifocal pattern , result unstable plaque anatomically remote location may emerge cause recurrent acute coronary syndrome . Current guideline primary PCI recommend treat culprit vessel urgent procedure , leave untreated vessel another elective procedure . Multivessel PCI recommend patient cardiogenic shock ( 20 , 21 , 26 ) . By strategy , operator intend avoid potential procedural complication may deteriorate patient 's left ventricular function clinical condition acute myocardial infarction . Therefore , report describe result simultaneous non culprit vessel PCI patient undergo mechanical reperfusion STEMI . An early study primary PCI patient multivessel disease show favorable result strategy stag percutaneous revascularization acute recanalization culprit artery ( 24 ) . In recent year use stent platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor , outcome elective multivessel PCI markedly improve ( 27 , 28 ) . More recent report simultaneous percutaneous revascularization non-culprit artery indicate may good strategy patient AMI find multivessel disease primary angioplasty ( 29 ) . According study involve Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery , complete revascularization show associate well outcome compare incomplete revascularizations ( 30 ) , ( 31 ) . In Bare Metal Stent ( BMS ) era , long term event free survival rate patient undergoing primary intervention multivessel disease show low 48.5 % ( 32 ) . In-Stent Restenosis see one major drawback vary 8 % high 80 % 6 month , accord anatomic clinical risk factor ( 33 ) . However , introduction Drug Eluting Stent ( DES ) show promising result similar result either PCI DES CABG patient multivessel disease see ( 34 ) , ( 35 ) , [ 12 ] .</detailed_description>

Target lesion ( ) must amenable percutaneous coronary intervention The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication follow medication : Heparin Aspirin Both Clopidogrel Ticlopidine Everolimus Platinum chromium Contrast medium Patients document sensitivity contrast medium effectively pre medicated steroid diphenhydramine [ e.g . rash ] may enrol . Those true anaphylaxis prior contrast medium , however , enrol . Systemic ( intravenous ) everolimus use within 12 month . Female childbearing potential , unless recent pregnancy test negative , possibly plan become pregnant time enrollment study . History bleeding diathesis know coagulopathy ( include heparin Gastrointestinal genitourinary bleeding within prior 3 month , major surgery within 2 month , induce thrombocytopenia ) , refuse blood transfusion . An elective surgical procedure plan would necessitate interruption thienopyridines first 6 month post enrollment . Noncardiac comorbid condition present life expectancy 1 year may result protocol noncompliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) . Patients actively participate another drug device investigational study , complete primary endpoint followup period .
