	<brief_summary>Sweeping strip membrane ( paper refer `` membrane sweeping '' ) widely utilized technique hasten delivery woman 37+ week gestation . The process membrane sweep probably cause release prostaglandin decidua cervix . The efficacy membrane sweep well study , show increase number patient labor within 72 hour , reduce frequency pregnancy continue beyond 41 42 week , reduce frequency formal induction labor . Thus , safe practical option woman wish avoid induction labor postterm pregnancy . Group B streptococcus ( GBS ; streptococcus agalactiae ) gram positive coccus frequently colonize human genital tract . In pregnant woman , GBS cause urinary tract infection , chorioamnionitis , postpartum endometritis . Newborn infant also acquire GBS infection passage vagina . Early onset GBS disease newborn lead pneumonia , meningitis , sepsis , life-threatening . Early onset GBS disease become rare since widespread use GBS screen prophylactic treatment pregnant woman . The relationship early onset GBS disease sweep membrane know . Based theoretical increase risk bacterial seed membrane sweeping , well concern fast labor inadequate treatment membrane sweeping , practitioner choose sweep membrane GBS positive patient . A meta-analysis show difference neonatal maternal infection rate woman underwent membrane sweeping . ACOG guideline state `` risk membrane strip GBS positive patient investigated well-designed , prospective study . Therefore , data insufficient encourage discourage practice '' . Specific Aims : In order help elucidate effect membrane sweep GBS positive patient , investigator propose prospective randomize trial . The investigator primary objective determine whether membrane sweep GBS positive woman associate inadequate antibiotic treatment labor ( define less four hour antibiotic therapy prior delivery ) . The investigator secondary objective measure effect membrane sweep pregnancy duration , length labor adverse event potentially relate membrane sweep maternal chorioamnionitis neonatal morbidity . Randomization real research portion study , since offer membrane sweep already standard care . Patients follow time delivery , within 6 week enrollment woman .</brief_summary>
