	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : SLE RA increase risk myocardial infarction ( MI , heart attack ) . Immune reactant circulation SLE patient downregulate cholesterol efflux proteins 27-hydroxylase ABCA1 upregulate scavenger receptor CD36 , thus encourage cholesterol accumulation . Adenosine A2A receptor agonist statin treatment cell expose SLE plasma ( immune complex cytokine-enriched plasma fraction SLE patient ) may ameliorate inflammatory property plasma , lessen atherogenic potency . Rationale : SLE RA plasma contain component present significant level normal plasma could , individually act together , affect 27-hydroxylase , ABCA1 CD36 expression . Candidate component include autoantibody , immune complex , various cytokine . Statins reduce major cardiovascular event death . Modulation adenosine signal participates regulation 27-hydroxylase ABCA1 . As potential preventative therapeutic approach atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , investigator evaluate effect A2A receptor agonist statins atherogenic parameter SLE RA plasma . Experimental Plan : Quantitate 27-hydroxylase several protein involve cellular cholesterol uptake excretion THP-1 monocytes/macrophages HAEC exposure plasma plasma component SLE patient ( control ) Â± lipid loading acetylate LDL with/without addition A2AR agonist , statin , . Determine relative impact immune complex cytokine expression proteins involve cholesterol flux . Determine level proteins involve cellular cholesterol influx/efflux peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate RA , SLE psoriatic arthritis patient normal control baseline , follow incubation culture medium alone statin , adenosine A2A agonist statin + A2AR agonist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atherosclerosis Rheumatoid Arthritis Lupus : Restoring Cholesterol Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) major cause morbidity mortality , especially patient autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus ( lupus ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . We find immune inflammatory mediator promote atherosclerosis disable mechanisms prevent cell artery wall overload cholesterol , lead formation lipid laden foam cell . This proposal seek identify specific component blood patient lupus RA make vulnerable ASCVD explore potential novel therapeutic approach utilize find naturally occur anti-inflammatory molecule adenosine restore normal cholesterol outflow cell line artery wall . 1 . A 40 cc blood sample take subject venipuncture . The plasma add cell culture medium ( 25 50 % vol/vol ) use incubation THP-1 monocytic leukemia cell and/or human monocyte-derived macrophage and/or human aortic endothelial cell effect exposure various disease control plasma cholesterol homeostatic protein expression culture cell assess . PBMC isolated portion sample Ficoll hypaque gradient centrifugation . Subject Inclusion &amp; Exclusion Criteria 1 . Normal Controls Normal healthy volunteer , age 18-65 , corticosteroids immune-modifying medication . Because SLE disease &gt; 90 % female prevalence RA similar gender bias towards female sex , data men exploratory able examine sex difference effect outcome measure ( 1 , 2 ) . 2 . Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Patients age 18-65 satisfy least 4 7 revise criterion ( 1987 ) classification rheumatoid arthritis ( 3 ) . 3 . Active SLE patient Patients , age 18-65 , must fulfill 1982 revised criterion American College Rheumatology ( formerly American Rheumatism Association ) classification SLE ( 4 ) . SLE activity status designate use SLEDAI disease activity index ( 5 ) . Patients previous documentation diagnosis connective tissue disorder SLE exclude . Patients statin treatment prior three month . 4 . Psoriatic Arthritis Patients Diagnosed accord criterion describe McGonacle et al ( 6 ) . Defined inflammatory arthritis associate psoriasis 40 patient recruit group . Anti-C1q antibody measure subject solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . 2 . Protection Human Subjects- Informed consent obtain subject patient confidentiality maintain time . The protocol consent form approve Winthrop University Hospital IRB . We use case study approach data pool anonymity preserve . To ensure anonymity , record blood specimen numerically cod , translation table accessible PI . Patients ask physician routine visit participate study . 3 . Sources research material- Blood sample ( 40 cc ) drawn routine outpatient visit faculty practice office Winthrop University Hospital Academic Rheumatologists . Patient chart utilized obtain information disease activity status , medication regimen , age , sex cardiovascular disease history . All information collect patient chart part standard medical recordkeeping . 4 . Potential Risk Subjects The study propose require donation blood sample ( 40 cc ) subject impose minimal risk subject blood draw . These risk include hematoma formation , rarely , infection puncture site . No intervention special measure involve . Furthermore , patient diagnose SLE RA require frequent monitoring blood parameter , whether relation disease activity monitor side effect treatment receive , acquisition blood sample study impose additional discomfort would experience routine medical care . The course treatment subject change way participation project . All blood specimen handle carefully full blood precaution . 5 . The Risks Study involve routine blood drawing . Donating blood may occasionally cause pain , bruising , faint small infection puncture site . 6 . Potential Benefits Proposed Research Subjects Others At time , direct benefit enrol subject . However , hope gather information may help people future reduce morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease . 7 . The Importance Knowledge Be Gained Although patient see direct personal benefit , knowledge gain immense potential benefit SLE RA patient may eventually lead u understanding role immunological mechanism pathogenesis premature cardiovascular disease . This understanding pave way development life-prolonging preventive therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
