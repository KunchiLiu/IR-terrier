	<brief_title>Body Weight Supported Treadmill Training vs. Overground Walking Training Persons With Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Body weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) overground walk training ( OWT ) two intervention commonly apply enhance gait balance patient chronic stroke . BWSTT OWT often use clinician separately tandem . While various aspect two intervention investigate past , limit research conduct compare effect two intervention patient chronic stroke . Longer train duration may always feasible due limited reimbursement option , lack clinic accessibility , transportation restriction patient chronic deficit follow stroke . A short burst training consist `` booster '' -like protocol may provide convenient option patient chronic stroke improve necessary functional skill short period time . The primary purpose pilot study compare walk speed immediately 3-months short-burst body-weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ) overground walk training ( OWT ) adults chronic stroke . Twenty participant chronic stroke recruit screened determine eligibility study . Participants randomly assign either BWSTT OWT 30 minute , 5 day per week 2 week . Outcome measure include assessment gait speed , endurance , walk pattern , fear fall , balance confidence , anxiety , activity participation daily life . Outcomes tested prior ( pre-test ) immediately ( post-test ) assign intervention 3-months complete intervention ( retention ) .</detailed_description>
