	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether person treat low-intensity , noninvasive form cortical electrical stimulation experience reduction symptom fibromyalgia different person receive sham treatment . Outcome measure include reduction patient pain level improvement sleep measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There increase acceptance pain fibromyalgia result dysfunctional sensory process spinal cord brain . Electrical cortical stimulation device-based form therapy increasingly consider adjuvant current medical modality treatment chronic pain condition fibromyalgia . The investigator propose stimulation cortical area believe involved dysfunctional sensory processing may beneficial influence fibromyalgia symptom . The aim randomize double blind , placebo control study evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability noninvasive cortical stimulation management fibromyalgia symptom . More specifically , active treatment group subject receive study 's cortical stimulation protocol twice week 11 week evaluate within 14 day follow end treatment , total timeframe 13 week . In comparison , similar group subject receive treatment protocol without actual stimulation signal apply . The signal utilized modulate form permit low-intensity signal pass out tissue less attenuation due tissue impedance . The signal sufficiently low strength level perception . Hence subject feel signal , therefore blind treatment arm . Investigators clinical staff also blind . Outcome measure include post-treatment baseline change tender point , sleep characteristic measure visual analog scale , outcome instrument include Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire .</detailed_description>
