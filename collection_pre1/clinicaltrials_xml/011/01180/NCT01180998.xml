	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy follow condition prior inclusion study : 1 . One following : 1 . Spherical contact lens user ( minimum 2 month wear , four day week , 8 hour day ) 2 . Contact Lens dropout ( contact lens wear last 6 month wear glass least four day week,8 hour day ) 3 . Neophyte ( habitual contact lens wear except trial fit 1 week , wear glass least four day week,8 hour day For patient currently wear lens , patient express desire try lenses . 2 . Between 16 60 year age . 3 . Have sign inform consent form ( documented investigator Case Report Form [ CRF ] ) . 4 . Distance requirement range +4.00D 9.00D ( i.e . 10.00D refractive ) 5 . Refractive astigmatism 0.75D 3.00D eye . 6 . Have best correct VA 6/9 ( 20/30 ) good eye . 7 . Have normal eye evidence abnormality disease . For purpose study normal eye define one : 1 . No amblyopia . 2 . No evidence lid abnormality infection . 3 . No conjunctival abnormality infection . 4 . No clinically significant slit lamp finding ( i.e . stromal haze , stain , scar , vascularisation , infiltrate abnormal opacity ) . 5 . No active ocular disease . 8 . Presbyopes may include ( monovision , spectacles contact lens bifocal glass ) Any follow render subject ineligible inclusion : 1 . Requires concurrent ocular medication . 2 . Clinically significant ( Grade 3 4 ) corneal stromal haze , corneal vascularisation , tarsal abnormality , bulbar hyperaemia , limbal hyperaemia , abnormality cornea would contraindicate contact lens wear . 3 . Corneal stain Grade 3 two region . 4 . Extended wear last 3 month . 5 . Has anterior ocular surgery . Has ocular surgery injury within 8 week immediately prior enrollment study . 6 . Abnormal lachrymal secretion . 7 . Preexisting ocular irritation would preclude contact lens fit . 8 . Keratoconus corneal irregularity . 9 . Any systemic illness would contraindicate lens wear medical treatment would affect vision successful lens wear . 10 . Has diabetes . 11 . Infectious disease ( e.g. , hepatitis , tuberculosis ) immunosuppressive disease ( e.g. , HIV ) . 12 . Pregnancy , lactate , plan pregnancy time enrollment . 13 . Participation concurrent clinical trial last 60 day .</criteria>
