	<detailed_description>I . Background Significance A . The epidemiology cognitive aging . Encompassing multiple cognitive domain , high order think include memory , language , abstract reasoning , visuospatial ability . A range study establish memory cognitive domain differentially target normal age process . With increase lifespan decrease co-morbid disease , age individual expect lead cognitively-challenging life . Even mild forgetfulness , therefore , long consider 'benign ' . Indeed , exponential growth age population , since memory decline occur u age , age-related memory decline emerge major societal problem . B . The anatomy cognitive aging . A range study human , non-human primate rodent establish hippocampal formation , brain circuit vital memory , target age process . Age-related hippocampal dysfunction therefore major contributor age-related memory decline . The hippocampal formation organize circuit , make separate interconnected region , include entorhinal cortex , dentate gyrus , CA subfields , subiculum . Because hippocampal circuit property , dysfunction one subregion affect function neighbor subregions hippocampal circuit whole . Thus , confront process cause hippocampal circuit malfunction , pinpoint subregion effect becomes important goal . In case age-related memory decline , range study human , non-human primate , rodent , suggest normal age cause hippocampal dysfunction differentially target dentate gyrus . C. Imaging cognitive aging . The anatomical organization hippocampal circuit differential vulnerability dentate gyrus cognitive aging imposes specific requirement brain image technique . Specifically , image technique must able assess functional integrity multiple hippocampal subregions , particular dentate gyrus . With mind , lab dedicate optimize functional brain image approach applicable human rodent hippocampal formation . We recently achieve goal , apply cross-species image capability investigate range process affect hippocampal function . D. Flavanols , exercise , cognitive aging . Previous study establish physical exercise improve hippocampal function . We recently exploit cross-species image technique show , within hippocampal circuit , exercise selective effect dentate gyrus function , human mice . Independently , recent study show flavanol epichatechin improves hippocampal function , importantly , within hippocampal circuit , epichatechin find differentially target dentate gyrus . Moreover , study show epichatechin couple exercise great effect dentate gyrus function . E. Summary . Starting around 30 year age , u begin experience insidious cognitive slide age-related memory decline . With expansion age , age-related memory decline swell epidemic proportion , ameliorate age-related memory decline emerge major societal goal . This proposal design test follow hypothesis : That flavanols without physical exercise ameliorate age-related memory decline . This hypothesis inform two set interleave finding : First , range study pinpoint dysfunction dentate gyrus specific brain region contribute age-related memory decline ; second , flavanol consumption without physical exercise enhances memory performance improve dentate gyrus function . In order experimentally test hypothesis image technique require assess functional integrity dentate gyrus , technique available . Importantly , image technique develop applied human also animal model , generate 'imaging readout ' . Cross-species image particularly important translational study .</detailed_description>
