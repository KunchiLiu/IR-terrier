	<brief_summary>The high-grade malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , comprise majority primary brain tumor adult . This group tumor also exhibit aggressive behavior , result median overall survival duration 9-12 month GBM , 3-4 year AA . Initial therapy consist surgical resection , external beam radiation . More recently , Phase 3 clinical publish Stupp et al 2005 show benefit use radiotherapy plus concomitant adjuvant Temozolomide . Still , patient experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . It unknown currently use intravenous ( IV ) therapy even cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) technique effectively increase concentration drug deliver brain spar body systemic side effect . One currently use drug call Temozolomide ( Temodar ) show active human brain tumor actual CNS penetration unknown . This phase I clinical research trial test hypothesis follow standard 42 day Temozolomide/radiotherapy regimen , Temozolomide safely use direct intracranial superselective intra-arterial cerebral infusion ( SIACI ) dose 250mg/m2 , follow standard maintenance cycle temozolomide ultimately enhance survival patient newly diagnose GBM/AA . The investigator determine toxicity profile maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SIACI Temozolomide . The investigator expect project provide important information regard utility SIACI Temozolomide therapy malignant glioma , may alter way drug deliver patient near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Super-Selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion Of Temozolomide ( Temodar ) For Treatment Of Newly Diagnosed GBM And AA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard care newly diagnose GBM radiation therapy plus concomitant oral Temozolomide dose 75mg/m2 150mg/m2 . Because blood brain barrier ( BBB ) drug penetrate blood vessel wall well get brain , one know sure oral drug actually get brain infusion . Previous study show intra-carotid artery ( intra-arterial ) delivery superior standard intravenous oral delivery increase penetration drug brain . Previous technique use intra arterial ( intracarotid ) infusion still non-selective drug delivery still go blood vessel brain , patient still significant adverse event , blindness . Newer techniques interventional neuroradiology allow selective delivery catheter arterial tree chemotherapy deliver without risk adverse affect blindness . Therefore , trial ask one simple question : Is safe deliver dose Temozolomide intrarterially use super selective delivery technique addition standard oral route administration ? This increase amount drug get tumor also spare patient many adverse effect less selective delivery . Prior single dose intra-arterial Temozolomide , patient also receive dose mannitol increase permeability blood brain barrier improve delivery agent brain . After single dose mannitol Temozolomide , patient evaluate 4 week assess toxicity . If toxicity point , patient proceed oral maintenance Temozolomide chemotherapy . In summary , Phase I trial design test safety single dose intra-arterial delivery Temozolomide immediately follow 42 day radiotherapy/oral temozolomide prior start oral maintenance Temozolomide . To summarize : Current Standard Care Therapy : Days 1-42 : Adjuvant dose Temozolomide 75mg/m2 42 day concomitant focal radiotherapy Day 42 : 4 week rest period Day 70 : Maintenance dose Temozolomide 150mg/m2 daily Days 1-5 28 day cycle 6 cycle Experimental portion proposal : Days 1-42 : Adjuvant dose Temozolomide 75mg/m2 42 day concomitant focal radiotherapy Day 42 : Single Intra-arterial Mannitol increase permeability blood brain barrier follow Intra-arterial Temozolomide single dose ( start 75mg/m2 250mg/m2 ) follow 4 week rest period Day 70 : Maintenance dose Temozolomide 150mg/m2 daily Days 1-5 28 day cycle 6 cycle Therefore experimental aspect treatment plan include : 1 . On day 42 , subject first treat Mannitol prior chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 25 % ; 3-10 mLs 30seconds ) order disrupt blood brain barrier . This technique use several thousand patient previous study IA delivery chemotherapy malignant glioma . 2 . Following addition mannitol , investigator deliver single SIACI dose Temozolomide patient high-grade glioma . After one-cycle observation period ass toxicity IA infusion , subject receive standard oral maintenance regimen Temozolomide chemotherapy . The Intra-Arterial Infusion Procedure do general anesthesia standard monitoring occur . The dose escalation algorithm follow : The investigator use single intracranial superselective intra-arterial infusion Temozolomide , start dose 75mg/m2 first three patient . Assuming dose limit toxicity next 28 day infusion , patient begin standard maintenance oral Temozolomide chemotherapy regimen . The dos escalate 75 100 , 150 , 200 , finally 250mg/m2 Phase I trial . Most patient GBM also monitor every two month serial history , neurological physical examination together serial blood count , prothrombin time ( PT ) , partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) chemistry . In addition , patient GBM MRI perform every two cycle approximately every two month assess tumor progression . . Since Phase I trial , response primary endpoint . However , investigator evaluate response one time IA Temozolomide therapy MRI injection contrast approximately 4 week infusion . Follow-up patient trial IA Temozolomide therapy continue disease progression death . Survival measure time dose IA Temozolomide® . The investigator expect patient trial monitor 12 month .</detailed_description>
