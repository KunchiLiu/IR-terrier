	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination AvastinTM ( bevacizumab ) Tarceva ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) help control advance liver cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Plus Bevacizumab Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) Second-line Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Erlotinib hydrochloride design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . There commercially available form drug ( call Tarceva ) expect similar erlotinib use study , possible may differences 2 formulation . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive study drug 28-day `` study cycle . '' You receive bevacizumab vein Days 1 15 cycle . The first dose bevacizumab give 90 minute . If reaction drug , fever and/or chill , next dose give 60 minute . If still reaction second dose , dose give 30 minute . If experience reaction bevacizumab , may give Tylenol® ( acetaminophen ) mouth and/or antihistamine vein 30 minute dose help minimize risk reaction . You take 1 erlotinib hydrochloride tablet mouth every day . You take erlotinib hydrochloride morning full glass water ( 6-8oz ) least 1 hour 2 hour food , grapefruit juice , vitamin , iron supplement , non-prescription drug . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycle 2 beyond : - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine blood test check well blood clot . - Urine collect routine testing . A 24-hour urine sample may collect need . If 24-hour urine sample need , provide special container collect sample . - You ask question side effect may drug may currently take take since last saw study doctor . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . On Day 15 Cycle 2 beyond , vital sign record . At end Cycle 2 , 4 , every 2 cycle ( Cycles 6 , 8 , 10 , ) : °You CT/MRI scan abdomen pelvis chest scan ( doctor think need ) check status disease . Additional test may do study study doctor think necessary . Length Treatment : You receive bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride long benefit . There maximum number cycle receive . If experience severe side effect , treatment study may delay , stop , study doctor may give small dos study drug . You take study disease get bad , side effect severe , doctor think best interest stop receive treatment . End-of-Treatment Visit : After stop receiving study drug , return end-of-treatment visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test learn well blood clot . - You ask question side effect may drug may currently take take since last saw study doctor . - You complete physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - CT and/or MRI scan abdomen pelvis perform check status disease . Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , study doctor continue review medical record every 3 month study analysis complete . You also call every 3 month long study doctor think need . During phone call , ask experience health problem . The phone call take 15 minute . During follow-up period , study doctor think necessary , may ask come clinic visit . This investigational study . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic colon rectal cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride FDA approve commercially available treatment lung cancer . The use drug combination patient advance liver cancer investigational . Up 44 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
