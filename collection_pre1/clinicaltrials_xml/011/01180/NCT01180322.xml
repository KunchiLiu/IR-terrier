	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II , four-arm , open-label , multi-center study adult patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) define inclusion/exclusion criterion . The primary efficacy objective evaluate impact sequential concurrent addition 5-azacytidine intensive induction chemotherapy idarubicin etoposide complete remission ( CR ) rate Sample size : 336 patient The treatment duration individual patient randomize one three experimental arm ( Arm B , C , D ) ( case application induction , consolidation maintenance therapy Azacitidine ) 30 month . The treatment duration patient randomized standard arm study ( Arm A ) 7 month ( case application induction , consolidation 2-yrs observation maintenance ( without treatment Azacitidine ) ) . In case induction follow consolidation allogeneic Stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) treatment duration per patient 6 month . Every patient follow month 54 inclusion study . Duration study individual patient include treatment ( induction , consolidation [ chemotherapy allogeneic SCT ] , maintenance [ experimental arm Azacitidine observation ] ) follow-up period : 54 month</brief_summary>
