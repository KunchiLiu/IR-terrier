	<detailed_description>The response growth hormone ( GH ) treatment , short-term well long-term , display considerable inter individual variability . This particularly evident endpoint paediatric GH administration , ( i.e . ) growth response , pronounce child affect GHD . This open-label , multicentric study subject pre-diagnosed GHD treat 4 week Saizen . Two hundred fourteen GHD evaluable pre-pubertal subject plan recruit approximately 9 site China . Demographic data , medical history , tanner stage , physical examination , body weight , height , bone age measurement , body mass index , review baseline medication procedure blood sample perform baseline visit , end treatment visit ( week 4 ) 4 week follow-up visit . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To compare response GHD child bear AGA bear SGA 4 week Saizen therapy Secondary Objectives : - To explore contribution select gene phenotype GHD child - To explore impact gene polymorphism level specific serum biomarkers GHD child 4 week Saizen therapy - To explore relationship change gene expression change serum biomarkers 4 week Saizen therapy spectrum gene polymorphism GHD child</detailed_description>
