	<brief_summary>Background : - In human DNA , Fragile X ( FMR1 ) gene help regulate nervous reproductive system . If gene abnormal , cause different kind problem , abnormal menstrual period , decrease fertility , muscle tremor , mental retardation . An abnormal FMR1 gene also make person susceptible medical condition , thyroid problem , high blood pressure , seizure , depression . More research need abnormality FMR1 gene lead problem , often problem appear individual abnormal FMR1 gene . - Researchers interested develop patient registry woman abnormality FMR1 gene . This registry allow researcher follow participant time study possible effect abnormality general reproductive health . Objectives : - To develop patient registry woman abnormal FMR1 gene monitor general reproductive health . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age abnormal FMR1 gene X chromosome . Design : - The following group woman eligible screen study : - Those family member Fragile X Syndrome mental retardation - Those ( family member ) primary ovarian insufficiency , also know premature menopause - Those ( family member ) certain neurological problem tremor Parkinson 's disease . - Eligible participant schedule initial study visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Participants regular menstrual period schedule visit day 3 8 menstrual cycle ; regular period may visit time month . In addition , estrogen-based treatment ( birth control pill ) must stop 2 week prior study visit . - Participants full physical examination , provide medical history , provide blood sample immediate future test . Participants return yearly visit test long study continue . - Participants develop primary ovarian insufficiency relate FMR1 gene also test measure bone thickness vaginal ultrasound examine ovary . These test schedule separate visit , repeat every 5 year duration study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Natural History Reproductive Overall Health Girls Women With Pre-Mutation FMR1 Gene ; Creation Patient Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spontaneous 46 , XX primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) cause decrease fertility approximately 1 % woman age 40 . The common know genetic cause 46 , XX POI pre -mutation Fragile X Mental Retardation ( FMR1 ) gene . The FMR1 gene locate X-chromosome contains CGG repeat un-translated region ; CGG repeat normally present less 55 copy , tendency expand across generation . Greater 200 CGG copy result Fragile X Syndrome ( FXS ) , common form heritable mental retardation . A pre-mutation FMR1 gene , define 55 199 CGG repeat , associate POI woman carry risk expand full mutation woman offspring , result child FXS . POI associate FMR1 pre-mutation know Fragile X-associated POI ( FXPOI ) . Approximately 20 % woman FMR1 pre-mutation develop FXPOI . Importantly , know woman pre-mutation develop FXPOI others . The primary objective study characterize natural history reproductive function woman FMR1 pre-mutation carrier create patient registry allow u follow longitudinally . Given relative rarity pre-mutation general population ( &lt; 1 % ) , patient registry necessary enrollment adequate number patient clinically significant analysis perform . In order characterize natural history reproductive function population , longitudinally track reproductive health participant , include menstrual history , pregnancy rate , biological ( serum ) marker ovarian function . The FMR1 pre-mutation may also associate specific general health risk , hypertension , thyroid disease , neurological disorder , psychiatric disorder . A patient registry also allow u track development common medical condition determine woman FMR1 pre-mutation increase health risk . Currently , screen guideline regard reproductive general health woman carry FMR1 pre-mutation , observation longitudinal data help develop guideline . Finally , standardize guideline genetic counsel woman FMR1 pre-mutation regard genetic risk child exist , data collect study enable .</detailed_description>
