	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Testosterone Replacement Patients With Low Risk Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most hormone-refractory disease currently define rise PSA follow androgen ablation antiandrogen . These patient typically asymptomatic minimal radiologically evident disease standard bone CT scan . Therapeutic option limit , 3rd line hormonal treatment generally provide brief duration benefit small minority patient . Chemotherapy effective , role somewhat toxic approach asymptomatic patient debatable . In addition , patient suffer long-term side effect androgen ablation muscle wasting , decreased strength , decrease sexual functioning , impaired cognition . If hypothesis androgen replacement inhibit cancer growth androgen insensitive patient correct , treatment would delay disease progression could also improve quality life . If hypothesis incorrect androgens actually stimulate growth , consequence unlikely catastrophic since select population minimal disease burden .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient histologically document diagnosis prostate adenocarcinoma ( PCa ) amenable curative treatment surgery radiation treatment . Patient surgically pharmacologically castrate least 6 month prior randomization . Castration must verify screen testosterone value &lt; 30 ng/dL . Any patient pharmacologically castrate must maintain androgen suppression therapy duration study . Patient must previous trial antiandrogen therapy . Patients must document antiandrogen withdrawal period prior randomization : flutamide require minimum 4 week withdrawal , nilutamide bicalutamide require minimum 6 week withdrawal . Patient must meet one follow PSA criterion : A 50 % rise PSA value within minimum rise least 3.0 ng/mL , within 6 month prior randomization , OR A rise PSA define two sequential increase PSA value . The following data require : initial value ( # 1 ) follow PSA value demonstrate increase ( # 2 ) . The increase must confirm another rise PSA ( # 3 ) ( 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 ) . There must least 2 week qualify PSA value absolute PSA value enrollment must least 3.0 ng/ml . At time screen patient must evidence visceral organconfined metastatic disease OR presence minimal bone metastasis without evidence visceral organconfined metastatic disease . The absence visceral organconfined metastatic disease define : No organconfined soft tissue metastasis ( e.g . lung , liver , etc . ) verify chest/abdomen/pelvic CT scan . The presence pathologically enlarge lymph node exclude subject study include definition visceral organconfined metastatic disease . The presence minimal bone metastasis define &lt; 1.4 % Bone Scan Index criterion ( see section 9 ) . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % , see Appendix A ) . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use Androderm速 context androgen ablation patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 1 singleagent trial . Patients must normal hepatic renal function define : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Patient active malignancy exception nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patient must possess ability understand willing sign write informed consent document . Patients history previous cytotoxic therapy radionuclide therapy ( rhenium , strontium , samarium ) . Patients may receive investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients evidence visceral organconfined metastasis minimal bone metastasis ( define &lt; 1.4 % Bone Scan Index , see section 9 ) and/or pathologically enlarge lymph node exclude . Patients local recurrence candidate local salvage therapy ( e.g . surgery , radiation , brachytherapy , cryotherapy ) exclude . Patients significant pulmonary disease receive chronic pulse steroid therapy within last 3 month prior randomization exclude . Steroid therapy nonpulmonary , nononcologic condition allow patient chronic , steadydose regimen minimum 2 month prior randomization . Patients know skin allergy polyester , alcohol , aluminum , silicone .</criteria>
