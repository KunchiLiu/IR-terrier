	<brief_summary>People anatomical leg length discrepancy ( LLD ) commonly present excessive subtalar pronation long leg compare short leg order equalize leg length . Although compensation may decrease stress pelvis and/or low back region , pronated foot may lead excessive stress load onto ankle foot , result musculoskeletal injury . Clinically , pronate foot effectively control use functional orthoses proper post adjust subtalar joint neutral position . But people compensatory pronated foot result anatomical LLD , control excessive pronation long leg would exaggerate asymmetry leg length . Instead , pronate foot control simply adjust length short leg . However , limited evidence intervention previous literature . The purpose research project go determine effect leg length adjustment pronation control people anatomical LLD . According purpose , 5 study objective develop : 1 ) examine validity reliability LLD measurement use hand-held laser distance meter , 2 ) compare foot type leg length adjustment , 3 ) compare kinetic variable leg length adjustment quiet stance , 4 ) compare kinetic variable leg length adjustment level walking , 5 ) compare symptoms functional level relate low back pain ( LBP ) leg length adjustment . The present research project design convenience sampling , prospective , quasi-experimental , pretest/posttest design . There 2 part research : 1 ) validity reliability test laser measure leg length 2 ) foot morphology kinetic analysis leg length adjustment . For first part research , 10 male adult 20 adult recruit validity reliability test respectively . Anthropometric measurement , include body height , body weight , foot length , foot width , heel-ball distance , measure consent form sign . Participants validity test receive stand pelvic radiography laser measure measure leg length . Each participant reliability test receive 2 session laser measure use hand-held laser-distance meter . For first session , laser measurement employ twice 2 raters rest interval 5 min . One week later , another session laser measure give one 2 raters . Intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) use test interrater reliability , intrarater reliability , validity laser measure method . Standard error measurement ( SEM ) , small real difference ( SRD ) calculate represent intrarater reliability also . For second part research , another thirty adult compensatory pronate foot result LLD include research project sample size adjust appropriate number accord power analysis . Each participant ask fill visual analog scale ( VAS ) Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) receive test contain foot type examination , quiet stance eye opening , quiet stance eye close , level walking . All test perform leg length adjustment . The experiment complete collect 3 successful trial test . All procedures do one month later . ANOVA repeat measure calculate compare difference variable among , immediately , 1 month follow leg length adjustment data fit assumption normal distribution . Discrete variables variable non-normal distribution test use Friedman test . All statistical analysis calculate use SAS 9.1.3 . The significant level set Î± = 0.05 power 0.8 . Five possible result may expect conduct research project : 1 ) good validity reliability laser distance meter measure LLD , 2 ) significant difference measurement foot type leg length adjustment , 3 ) significant difference kinetic data quiet stance leg length adjustment , 4 ) significant difference kinetic data level walk leg length adjustment , 5 ) symptom functional level relate LBP improve leg length adjustment . Completion research project project provide solid objective evidence leg length adjustment view morphology kinetics people pronated foot due anatomical LLD .</brief_summary>
