	<brief_title>Apnea , Bariatric Surgery Versus Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) one common complication obesity , result excessive sleepiness daytime functional impairment well act synergistically obesity predispose hypertension , insulin resistance , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , stroke . The current first line treatment moderate severe OSA , nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) extremely effective often well tolerate , lead low adherence rate many patient . Bariatric surgery approve treatment OSA patient co-morbid obesity small study , appear produce substantial improvement . However , trial directly compare bariatric procedure standard CPAP treatment yet exist guide clinician patient choose appropriate first line treatment . This trial address feasibility safety , estimate effect size subsequent Phase 3 trial . We recruit 80 patient severe OSA morbid obesity ( body mass index , BMI , 35-45 kg/m2 ) two large clinical sleep program together care wide spectrum demographically diverse group OSA patient . After establish patient physician equipoise , subject randomize trial CPAP laparoscopic gastric band first line treatment OSA . The primary outcome measure improvement OSA severity ideal real life condition ( i.e. , CPAP arm , use CPAP control environment vs. use prescribed therapy usual home environment , respectively ) , allow assessment comparative efficacy effectiveness . Outcomes assess 9 month quantify early effectiveness treatment strategy well demonstrate clinical equipoise conduct future large long term trial use two arm . Further follow-up occur 18 month subset 40 patient determine effect size subsequent study point bariatric arm near plateau weight . Secondary outcome include patient-related outcome include sleepiness , quality life , index health service utilization . In addition , change biomarkers related inflammation , insulin resistance , lipid , blood pressure , arterial stiffness assess group , relationship change BMI OSA , identify promise outcome measure future trial . Incurred cost collect subject order establish parameter need cost effectiveness analysis . This pilot study represent first control comparison medical surgical treatment OSA addition , provide necessary data develop optimal study design subsequent long term multi-center comparative effectiveness study well understand potential role bariatric surgery may offer management OSA .</detailed_description>
