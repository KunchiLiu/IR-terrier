	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate GSK561679 , orally available , brain penetrant selective CRH1 antagonist ability reduce alcohol crave recently detoxify alcohol dependent woman response stress alcohol-associated stimulus . Study population : Up 60 anxious , alcohol dependent woman , age 21-65 year enrol complete study 50 patient . Background : - Anxiety , irritability , anger , depression cause stress may lead continue drink heavy drinker . One way brain respond stress protein brain cell call CRH receptor . Previous research show CRH receptor involve negative emotional state chronic alcohol consumption increase activity CRH receptor brain . Medications block CRH receptor decrease stress-triggered alcohol consumption . - GSK561679 , experimental drug block CRH receptor , reduce negative emotion anxiety person desire alcohol . By look brain response stress study drug use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan , researcher hope learn whether GSK561679 effective treatment stress-related alcohol abuse . Objectives : - To evaluate usefulness GSK561679 reduce stress-related alcohol crave alcohol-dependent woman . Design : - Participants study enrolled standard NIH treatment program alcohol dependence , require stay NIH inpatient treatment unit additional 31 day . - Participants receive either study medication placebo take day even 4 week . - Participants follow procedure study medication : - Questionnaires alcohol crave , depression , anxiety . - Recordings response personal emotional reaction stressful , nonstressful , alcohol-related situation , blood sample take response . - Regular blood test measure stress hormone blood . - Speech preparation presentation ( Trier test ) , along blood sample , measure stress hormone blood . - Sessions measure responses alcohol-related cue . - Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan . - Participants return follow-up visit 1 week 1 month stop study drug discharge study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate GSK561679 , orally available , brain penetrant selective CRH1 antagonist ability reduce alcohol crave recently detoxify alcohol dependent woman response stress alcohol-associated stimulus . Study population : Up 60 anxious , alcohol dependent woman , age 21-65 year enrol complete study 50 patient . Design : Subjects inpatient enter present protocol withdrawal treatment , need , complete . One week single blind placebo follow randomize double blind treatment active medication placebo approximately 3 week . Spontaneous crave alcohol rating psychopathology obtain twice weekly throughout study . During placebo lead-in week , diurnal cortisol curve obtain , baseline dexamethasone-CRH test may carry . These measure repeat 10-14 day randomize treatment . Around time , crave response also assess challenge session combine social stressor exposure physical alcohol cue . During final week , three session guide imagery carry , separate day counter-balanced order , expose subject personalize stress- , alcohol- neutral condition associate stimulus . An fMRI session carry last . Subjects remain hospitalize throughout study , remain unit 3 day post-medication monitoring period . Outcome measure : The primary outcome crave alcohol guide imagery challenge session . Secondary outcome include crave measure combine social stress alcohol cue challenge session , spontaneous crave psychopathology rating repeatedly measure inpatient unit time . Exploratory blood biomarkers brain response positive negative affective stimulus fMRI session also obtain .</detailed_description>
