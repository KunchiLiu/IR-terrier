Metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma metastatic gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma , initially diagnosed recurrent . 4 . Measurable disease accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 5 . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 6 . Life expectancy least 3 month 7 . Adequate bone marrow , liver renal function assess follow laboratory requirement : Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g / dl Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 / mm3 Platelet count ≥ 100,000 / mm3 Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ALT AST &lt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( &lt; 5 x ULN patient liver involvement cancer ) International normalize ratio PT ( PTINR ) / PTT &lt; 1.5 x ULN 8 . Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60 ml / min ( base Cockcroft Gault formula ) 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Signed informed consent must obtain prior study specific procedures 1 . Patients localregional gastric gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma ( paraaortic node visceral structureinvading primary [ T4 ] ) potentially become candidate surgery curative intent follow systemic therapy 2 . History cardiac disease : Congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA class 2 ; unstable angina ( angina symptom present rest ) , newonset angina ( begin within last three month prior randomization ) myocardial infarction within six month prior randomization ; Ventricular arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy ( beta blocker digoxin permit ) ; Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ) despite optimal medical management 3 . Past concurrent history neoplasm &lt; 5 year prior start study treatment gastric adenocarcinoma gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma , except curatively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ carcinoma cervix uteri superficial bladder tumor [ Ta noninvasive tumor ( Ta ) , carcinoma situ ( Tis ) T1 ( tumor invades lamina propria ) ] 4 . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior randomization 5 . Evidence gastrointestinal perforation bowel obstruction screen period 6 . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy 7 . Nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture 8 . History gastrointestinal bleeding &gt; grade 1 CTCAE version 4.0 within 4 week prior randomization 9 . History bleed &gt; grade 2 accord CTCAE version 4.0 within 4 week prior randomization 10 . Known psychiatric neurological disorder include known peripheral autonomous neuropathy hearing impairment &gt; grade 1 accord CTCAE version 4.0 However , patient already know irreversible grade 4 hearing loss ( &gt; 90 decibel ( dB ) bilaterally ) baseline , eligible investigator 's discretion 11 . Pregnant lactate woman , woman childbearing potential employ adequate contraception [ Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within seven day prior start treatment . Of note , men woman enrol trial must use adequate barrier birth control measure course trial four week completion trial 6 month last dose cisplatin ( whichever great ) . The definition effective contraception base clinical judgment principal investigator designate associate . ] 12 . Evidence infection ( &gt; grade 2 ) 13 .

Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency 23 . Substance abuse , medical , psychological social condition may interfere patient 's participation study evaluation study result 24 . Evidence thrombotic embolic disease , include cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolus within past 6 month 25 . Any tumor characteristic investigator deem unsuitable potentially cytoreductive therapy due likelihood severe bleed perforation ulceration hemorrhage . Excluded therapy medication 26 . Prior concomitant systemic anticancer therapy include cytotoxic therapy , target agent , experimental therapy gastric cancer . However , ( neo ) adjuvant cytotoxic therapy permit last dose administer &gt; 6 month ( 12 month platinum base therapy ) start study medication study . 27 . Radiotherapy prior study ( palliative radiotherapy allow described 'prior concomitant therapy section',4.3.7 ) 28 . Use biologic response modifier , granulocyte GCSF , within 3 week study entry study . 29 . Investigational drug therapy outside trial within 4 week prior randomization 30 .
