	<brief_summary>Patients severe sepsis septic shock suffer life-threatening infection . Fast adequate therapy antibiotic crucial survival . Current guideline recommend application broad-spectrum antibiotic within 1 hour diagnosis . However , recent study show treatment delay several hour . In study , medical staff participate hospital train achieve duration antimicrobial therapy le 1 hour . Tools change management use . The data compare control group ( hospital without intervention ) . It hypothesize multifaceted educational program decrease duration antimicrobial therapy improve survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study cluster randomize trial ( CRT ) hospitals cluster . 44 hospital Germany confirm participation . Hospitals randomize two group : control interventional group . The control group receive conventional CMEs . The interventional group receive tool increase awareness poster brochure . Quality measure benchmarking feedback quality indicator use . Depending improvement process tool SWOT analyse resistance radar implement . The CRT precede 5 month observational study ( Dec. 2010 - April 2011 ) . In 1000 patient , participate hospital document patient severe sepsis septic shock register . These data use final sample size calculation CRT stratification randomization . The group switch completion CRT observation continue . Thus , center control group receive change management former intervention group without external support assess sustainability intervention . This study phase plan Nov. 2013 March 2015 . Sample size calculate CRT finish .</detailed_description>
