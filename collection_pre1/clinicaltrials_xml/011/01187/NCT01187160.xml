	<brief_title>Transoral Robotic Surgery ( TORS ) Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visit 1 - Outpatient Clinical Setting . The patient evaluate prior treatment outpatient clinical set way consistent routine workup prior surgery tongue base sleep apnea . This include sleep nasendoscopy ( see ) , predict pre-treatment transoral robotic approach may appropriate patient give option participate study . This include review patient 's pre-operative sleep study nasopharyngolaryngoscopic exam ass lingual tonsillar hypertrophy . A pre-operative MRI obtain provide quantitative measurement patient 's tongue base hypertrophy . Visit 2 - Sleep Nasendoscopy . The patient undergo sleep nasendoscopy outline , order ass involvement tongue base patient 's sleep disorder breathing . This routine diagnostic procedure . Patients pharmacologically induce light phase sleep upper airway visualize directly nasopharyngolaryngoscope . Anesthetic management perform standard fashion , use propofol titrate endpoint moderate sedation , typically do procedural sedation esophagogastroduodenoscopy . Administration log permit analysis dosing requirement . Respiratory pattern monitor noninvasively log permit correlation obstruction propofol administration . Visit 3 - Intraoperative Setting . The patient undergo evaluation `` adequate exposure '' transoral robotic surgery `` adequate exposure '' achieve undergo transoral robotic surgery lingual tonsillar hypertrophy treat obstructive sleep apnea . Visit 4 - Postoperative Setting . This inpatient and/or outpatient set within three week surgical procedure . The patient undergo routine postoperative clinical evaluation . Visit 5 - Postoperative Testing . The patient undergo follow-up sleep study determine efficacy surgical procedure three month post-operatively , standard interval use determine outcome procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient 18 old time treatment . Patient must present indication surgical management tongue base treat obstructive sleep apnea . Written inform consent and/or consent waiver IRB . Preoperative exclusion criterion : Unexplained fever and/or untreated , active infection . Patient pregnancy . Previous head neck surgery preclude transoral/robotic procedure . The presence medical condition contraindicate general anesthesia transoral surgical approach . Intraoperative exclusion criterion ( It recognize sometimes patient exclude study participation prepare surgical suite anatomy expose available medical analysis . The following situation represent instance whereby patient would exclude study base upon anatomical finding evident preoperative setting ) : Inability adequately visualize anatomy perform diagnostic therapeutic surgical approach transorally .</criteria>
