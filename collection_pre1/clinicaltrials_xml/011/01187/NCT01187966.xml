Patients levodopa responsive must receive treatment stable dose levodopa [ 410 dos per day levodopa preparation ( include CR , IR combination CR/IR ) , plus benserazide/carbidopa ; without addition COMT inhibitor ] may receive concomitant treatment stable dos dopamine agonist and/or anticholinergic screen visit . Patients receive study medication addon therapy start baseline . Patients motor fluctuation , &gt; 1.5 hour `` '' time day . Patients must able maintain accurate complete diary ( 18hour ) , help caregiver , record `` '' time , `` '' time minor dyskinesia , `` '' time troublesome dyskinesia , `` '' time , time asleep . Patients must able understand willing sign approve Informed Consent form . The patient indication form parkinsonism idiopathic Parkinson 's disease . If female , patient childbearing potential , pregnant lactating . The patient late stage Parkinson 's disease , experience severe , disable peakdose biphasic dyskinesia and/or unpredictable widely swing fluctuation symptom . The patient current diagnosis substance abuse ( DSMIV ) history alcohol drug abuse past 3 month . The patient current clinically significant gastrointestinal , renal , hepatic , endocrine , pulmonary cardiovascular disease , include acute gastric ulcer , hypertension wellcontrolled , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , Type I diabetes . Patients history gastric ulcer episode acute gastritis last 6 month currently experience gastric pain eligible inclusion . The patient second thirddegree atrioventricular block sick sinus syndrome , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation , severe unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 3 month screen visit , significant ECG abnormality , include QTc ≥ 450 msec ( male ) ≥ 470 msec ( female ) , QTc base Bazett 's correction method . The patient participate previous clinical trial safinamide . The patient concomitant disease likely interfere study medication ( e.g . capable alter absorption , metabolism elimination study drug ) . The patient history psychosis ( e.g . schizophrenia psychotic depression ) , either previously currently , score ≥ 3 Item 2 ( think disorder ) 3 ( depression ) UPDRS Section I . The patient evidence dementia cognitive dysfunction , indicate MMSE score &lt; 22 , score ≥ 3 item 1 ( mentation ) UPDRS , Section I .

The patient participate previous clinical trial within 30 day entry study ( screen visit ) receive treatment investigational compound within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , prior screen . The use investigational drug safinamide study permit . The patient receive treatment his/her depression MAO inhibitor ( e.g. , selegiline ) , tricyclic , SNRI ( e.g. , venlafaxine , duloxetine ) screen visit . Note : Use SSRIs permit , provide dose keep low possible remain stable throughout trial . The patient receive treatment his/her parkinsonian symptom MAO inhibitor . Note : Patients receive amantadine , COMT inhibitor , DA agonists and/or anticholinergic eligible enter trial , provide stable dose screening . The patient receive treatment agent know significantly inhibit induce drugmetabolizing enyzmes ( e.g. , barbiturate , phenothiazine , etc . ) within 4 week precede screen visit . The patient receive treatment opioids ( e.g. , tramadol , meperidine derivative ) , 4 week prior screen visit . The patient receive treatment depot neuroleptic within one injection cycle , oral neuroleptic within 4 week prior screen visit . Patients receive low dose oral neuroleptic treatment psychotic symptom ( e.g. , hallucination ) relate Parkinson 's disease antiparkinsonian medication , meet entry criterion , consider enrollment , approval CRO Medical Monitor . The Investigator must agree increase dose oral neuroleptic trial , unless require significant worsening . The patient receive treatment drug hepatotoxic potential , e.g. , tamoxifen , within 4 week , receive radiation therapy drug cytotoxic potential , e.g , chemotherapy , within one year prior screen visit . The patient history current diagnosis HIV , test positive Hepatitis B surface antigen , test positive Hepatitis B core antibody , negative Hepatitis B surface antibody , test positive Hepatitis C antibody . The patient abnormality investigator deem clinically relevant , either medical history , physical examination , ECG diagnostic laboratory test . In judgment Clinical Investigator patient likely noncompliant uncooperative study . Ophthalmologic history include follow condition : albino patient , family history hereditary retinal disease , progressive and/or severe diminution visual acuity ( i.e. , 20/70 ) , retinitis pigmentosa , retinal pigmentation due cause , active retinopathy ocular inflammation ( uveitis ) , progressive , severe diabetic retinopathy .</criteria>
