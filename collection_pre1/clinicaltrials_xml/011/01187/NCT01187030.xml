	<brief_summary>There little evidence guide current use Frozen Plasma . Despite , 260,000 unit frozen plasma transfuse Canada annually . Based limited publish data available , pattern practice Frozen Plasma transfusion highly variable important number Frozen Plasma transfusion appear inappropriate . Given inappropriate use , inevitable percentage patient experience unnecessary potentially life-threatening adverse transfusion reaction . Current guideline Frozen Plasma offer little help guide specific clinical decision recommendation lack sufficient clinical detail . This lack detail also hinder utility guideline help monitor improve clinical practice . Further research examine Frozen Plasma transfusion include understand current use critical improve utilization valuable limited resource .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : We ( 1 ) systematically review evidence use Frozen Plasma transfusion , ( 2 ) establish appropriateness rating clinical scenario Frozen Plasma transfuse , ( 3 ) perform 3-month prospective study understand current use appropriateness use Frozen Plasma 12 Canadian academic centre . Methods Analysis : Following well establish methodology evaluate medical therapy develop RAND/UCLA , investigator purposively employ different epidemiologic technique assess current use appropriateness Frozen Plasma transfusion Canada . First , undertake thorough systematic review evidence use Frozen Plasma across indication . The RAND modify Delphi methodology use determine appropriateness transfuse Frozen Plasma across comprehensive set clinical scenario . A panel 9 expert represent relevant clinical specialty use evidence systematic review determine appropriateness rating ( ordinal scale 1-9 ) clinical scenario . Subsequently , undertake prospective cohort study episodes Frozen Plasma transfusion ( approximately 5000 episode ) 10 Canadian academic centre ( 17 hospital ) use appropriateness rating . Trained research assistant identify transfusion episode via blood bank perform chart review obtain demographic variable ( age , sex , weight ) , clinical variable ( diagnosis , coagulopathy , indication freeze plasma transfusion , blood product transfusion ) , laboratory ( pre posttransfusion coagulation test ) information . These data allow map transfusion event onto specific clinical scenario rat expert panel assignment appropriateness rating . We also determine total number patient number patient large user group Frozen Plasma hospital . The primary outcome prospective cohort study , proportion inappropriate transfusion ( appropriateness ) proportion patient transfuse ( overall utilization ) , initially examine use descriptive statistic . Using hierarchical modeling , logistic regression analysis use examine proportion inappropriate transfusion control indication , hospital , patient factor . For analysis overall utilization Frozen Plasma , chi-square analysis use compare proportion patient transfuse large user group different hospital . A secondary analysis examine dose Frozen Plasma transfuse . Generated Research : From systematic review , appropriateness rating , result cohort study , summarize evidence support use Frozen Plasma , produce detailed clinical guideline outline appropriate inappropriate indication Frozen Plasma provide understanding variation use appropriateness Frozen Plasma . Each element use hospital Canada elsewhere improve current use Frozen Plasma . Understanding variation Frozen Plasma allow framework improve transfusion practice identify area Frozen Plasma use merit great attention research .</detailed_description>
