	<brief_title>Short Non-coding RNA Biomarkers Predisposition Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer lethal female reproductive malignancy , mainly 80 % tumor metastasize beyond ovary time diagnosis . Screening effort aim improved identification early stage disease largely unsuccessful , ovarian cancer 's propensity early spread . Our hypothesis obstacle circumvent identify biomarkers precancerous stage disease . Since pre-cancerous stage currently undetectable , instead propose look biomarkers woman high risk develop ovarian cancer due genetic mutation . We hypothesize identification marker genetic predisposition ovarian cancer also informative detection biological change time lead sporadic cancer . Given increasingly recognize role state normal abnormal growth differentiation , hypothesize short non-coding RNAs ( sncRNAs ) hold significant promise biomarkers ovarian cancer predisposition . We test hypothesis two aim . First , identify biomarkers hereditary ovarian cancer risk compare serum-derived sncRNAs woman without hereditary risk ovarian cancer . In second aim define serum-derived sncRNAs correlate ovarian cancer disease status . We compare sera ovarian cancer patient time high low disease burden control , cancer-free subject . Each aim provide independent , novel , important information future investigation . The sncRNAs find differentially express aim prioritize future validation woman clinical surveillance hereditary risk ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
