	<brief_summary>Goal : The primary goal study longitudinally investigate , head neck cancer ( HNC ) patient , potential fibrosis-lymphedema continuum . Specifically , examine development , pattern , progression , prevalence late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema , explore potential biological correlative include pro-inflammatory cytokine genetic polymorphism , evaluate relationship among late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema select psychosocial stressor potentially interact cytokine pathway . H : A minimum 20 percent HNC patient experience late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema . H : We able differentiate characteristic pattern development late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema . H : We able differentiate pattern symptom associate late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema . H : We able differentiate pattern inflammatory response development late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema . H : Select polymorphism increase likelihood development late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema . H : Incidence severity late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema correlate total dose radiation involve anatomical site . H : HNC patient fibrosis and/or lymphedema experience great level depression social withdrawal without condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The use aggressive treatment HNC , particularly combine modality treatment regimen result increase survival . Unfortunately , improvement come mark increase acute late-effects . These undesirable treatment outcome exact heavy toll functional capacity , contribute myriad problematic physical psychological symptom , negatively impact Quality Life , likely create significant economic burden patient health care system . Objective : This four year , longitudinal study examine development , pattern , nature , progression , prevalence late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema , explore potential host biological correlative ( pro-inflammatory cytokine genetic polymorphism ) , examine select psychological stressor ( depression , social withdrawal ) , associate late-effect fibrosis lymphedema HNC survivor . Specific Aims:1 . To determine prevalence nature late-effect ( â‰¥3 month post-treatment ) fibrosis and/or lymphedema HNC patient . 2 . To explore relationship among biological mechanism inflammatory response , genetic polymorphism , treatment factor , late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema HNC patient . 3 . To explore relationship among late-effect fibrosis and/or lymphedema psychosocial stressor ( depression social withdrawal ) HNC patient . Study Design : HNC patient assessed baseline , end treatment ( EOT ) , every six week treatment one year treatment , twice 15 18 month post-treatment . These interval choose reduce subject burden routinely coincide schedule laryngoscopic procedure . At baseline , follow assessment undertaken : 1 ) demographic information alcohol tobacco use history ; 2 ) disease characteristic ; 3 ) presence tumor related fibrosis and/or lymphedema ( laryngoscope digital photograph score internal lymphedema Patterson Scale ) external fibrosis/lymphedema digital photography , physical exam fibrosis/lymphedema use Foldi criterion , CT scan ; 4 ) blood inflammatory mediator polymorphisms ; 5 ) psychosocial assessment ( Center epidemiological Studies Depression Scale , Liebowitz Anxiety Scale ) ; 6 ) functional assessment ( MBVS , Cervical Range Motion [ CROM ] , Neck Disability Index VHNSS ) . Post-treatment , every scheduled assessment thereafter , patient undergo repeat assessment everything except : demographic information , medical history , ETOH smoke history , polymorphisms MBVs .</detailed_description>
