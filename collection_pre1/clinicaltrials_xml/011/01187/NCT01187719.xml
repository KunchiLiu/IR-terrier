	<brief_summary>The primary objective two-phase trial follow : - To determine elimination half-life NVP HIV positive pregnant woman receive single dose labour addition ZDV 3TC without seven day phenytoin ( pilot PK phase ) - To determine NVP resistance HIV positive pregnant woman receive single dose labour addition ZDV 3TC without seven day phenytoin ( main trial phase ) The secondary objective two-phase trial follow : - To determine safety single dose nevirapine seven day phenytoin part ARV prophylaxis PMTCT vs. single dose nevirapine without phenytoin part ARV prophylaxis PMTCT - To determine HIV status infant - To determine safety ARV prophylaxis PMTCT seven day phenytoin newborn Hypothesis : phenytoin reduces elimination half life SD NVP thereby decrease development resistance NVP HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian Zambian woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial ( VITA2 ) do phenytoin enzyme inducer decrease elimination half-life NVP also show significant difference elimination half-life NVP ENVI study side effect also transient mild . The guideline ARV prophylaxis PMTCT change complex regimen . Therefore addition phenytoin OD 7 day delivery complicate regimen mother . Tanzania Zambia among country sub-Saharan Africa affect HIV pandemic . In 2008 , estimate 85,000 child live HIV Zambia 89,000 child bear HIV infected woman , 28,000 infect annually . In Tanzania , 140,000 child live HIV 2007 . Both country use NVP alone combination drug ARV prophylaxis PMTCT . Little data available extent NVP resistance Tanzanian , Zambian PMTCT setting . Moreover , data available follow-up mother-infant pair particular focus resistance NVP infant HIV status . No study explore possibility reduce NVP resistance use enzyme inducer . This study seek effect phenytoin pharmacokinetics NVP development NVP resistance SD NVP part ARV prophylaxis PMTCT . This intervention part VITA2 trial test hypothesis phenytoin reduce elimination half life SD NVP thereby decrease development resistance NVP HIV positive pregnant Tanzanian Zambian woman .</detailed_description>
