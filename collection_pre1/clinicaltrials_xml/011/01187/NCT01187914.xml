	<brief_title>Effect Structural Remodeling Scar Formation Assessed DE-MRI Left Atrium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) electrophysiological condition characterize disorganized electrical activity involve entire atrium . AF manifest initially paroxysms arrhythmia later progress persistent permanent form . It progressive disease associate structural , electrical contractile change leave atrium ( LA ) . A major determinant progression AF structural remodel fibrosis occur left atrium . A extensively remodeled atrium present substrate need arrhythmia persist . Structural remodel also major determinant success rhythm control strategies AF . While catheter ablation reproducibly show superior anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) therapy rhythm control AF , success procedure significantly affect extent structural remodel present time catheter ablation . Delayed-Enhancement Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DE-MRI ) demonstrate effective modality identify fibrotic scarred cardiac tissue excellent correlation electro-anatomical mapping . This related characteristic Gadolinium , extracellular contrast agent effective identifying region fibrotic non-viable myocardium . DE-MRI technology powerful , non-invasive method , identify extent distribution structural remodel fibrosis associate AF . Specific image acquisition sequence allow reproducible identification high pixel intensity region within 2-dimensional image atrial wall . 3-Dimensional reconstruction entire leave atrium provide quantification overall volume occupy hyper-enhanced region relative entire leave atrial wall volume . Used prior catheter ablation , DE-MRI therefore identify region significant structural remodel fibrosis . The technology also show useful examine amount distribution ablation-induced scarring . Catheter ablation emerge effective interventional therapeutic modality AF patient . Current ablation technique , include pulmonary vein antrum isolation ( PVAI ) , use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy induce thermal damage LA substrate attempt electrically disconnect isolate arrhythmogenic focus originate pulmonary vein ( PVs ) . Multiple catheter technology RF develop . Catheters may either cool . Cooling allow high deep energy delivery large lesion formation . Open irrigation cooled-tip RF ablation AF associate less impedance rise , microbubble formation , esophageal injury compare traditional non-cooled ablation catheter . It also associate short RF delivery time , fluoroscopy , procedural time . Understanding temporal sequence event LA structural remodeling ( precede AF ablation ) scar formation ( follow AF ablation ) prove valuable determine whether certain patient susceptible recovery electrical conduction recurrence AF . DE-MRI recently introduce mean visualize RF-induced scar post-ablation . These scan reconstruct three-dimensional ( 3D ) recreation LA allow analysis quantification LA scar formation follow RF ablation . Objectives : Primary Objective â€¢ To evaluate impact pre-ablation structural remodeling ( fibrosis ) scar formation progression LA assess DE-MRI patient undergone successful open irrigate cooled-tipped RF ablation paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( PAF ) , use observational , longitudinal data University Utah Comprehensive Arrhythmia Research &amp; Management ( CARMA ) Center support AFIB database ( approve IRB # 20347 ) 12-month follow period . Secondary Objectives - To determine secondary variable , total ablation time , number lesion , power deliver , impedance , may play significant role catheter induce scar formation . - To promulgate future research opportunity field AF , particularly regard possible early intervention measure may impact progression . - To adapt treatment aim patient AF diagnose early stage . - To use DE-MRI knowledge understand RF ablation therapy well understand benefit longitudinal effect use scar formation eliminate fibrotic tissue conduct impulses lead AF .</detailed_description>
