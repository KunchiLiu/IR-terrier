	<brief_summary>The sphincter Oddi circular band muscle control flow pancreatic juice bile small intestine . Abnormal function Sphincter Oddi , know Sphincter Oddi dysfunction ( SOD ) , lead recurrent episodes abdominal pain . Making diagnosis SOD difficult currently achieve use invasive pressure test . This pressure test associate adverse effect include inflammation pancreas gland . We investigate alternative test medication give provoke spasm sphincter . Following provocation , blood sample detect change blood composition change sphincter anatomy evaluate use specialized imaging technique . Our aim study compare effect two provocation medication ( morphine-prostigmine secretin ) biliary pancreatic ductal anatomy , use dynamic serial MRCP healthy volunteer . Our hypothesis morphine-neostigmine provocation result great change biliary pancreatic ductal anatomy assess use dynamic serial MRCP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sphincter Oddi ( SO ) , encase distal common bile duct ( CBD ) pancreatic duct ( PD ) , comprise fibromuscular complex control flow biliary pancreatic secretion duodenum . Aberrant function SO , know Sphincter Oddi dysfunction ( SOD ) , lead recurrent episode biliary pancreatic type pain . Both surgical sphincteroplasty endoscopic sphincterotomy improve symptom patient suspect SOD . However , poor result obtain significant proportion reflect difficulty achieve accurate diagnosis also select patient likely benefit procedure . A number investigative modality employ assessment SOD . Of available diagnostic test sphincter Oddi manometry ( SOM ) consider gold standard , associate high rate post procedure morbidity include pancreatitis biliary sepsis . It therefore unsurprising attention focus non-invasive diagnostic test . Developments magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) allow detailed non-invasive assessment biliary pancreatic ductal morphology use conjunction intravenous secretin provocation ( ss-MRCP ) . Evaluations technique far disappointing , demonstrate modest concordance SOM patient suspect SOD . The morphine-prostigmine provocation test ( Nardi test ) previously utilised screen test patient symptoms suggestive SOD . It perform give intramuscular injection morphine 10mg prostigmine 1mg , positive test indicate reproduction pain fourfold increase either serum amylase lipase level . As enzymatic change show occur healthy subject irritable bowel syndrome , test largely fall favour . However , recent publication suggest morphine use pharmacological provocation agent improve ductal distension aid differentiation pancreaticobiliary variant MRCP . To date investigate randomise blind study therefore propose examine effect morphine-neostigmine secretin provocation gallbladder volume biliary pancreatic ductal morphology healthy volunteer use serial MRCP .</detailed_description>
