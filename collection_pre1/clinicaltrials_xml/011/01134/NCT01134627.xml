	<brief_title>Minocycline add-on Interferon Beta-1a IFN Beta-1a ( Rebif® ) Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis RRMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interferon beta-1a approve standard therapy RRMS . The beneficial effect minocycline experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) model possible inhibitory effect degradation IFN beta-1a suggest minocycline treatment may beneficial effect MS add-on therapy subject treatment IFN beta-1a . Adjuvant treatment minocycline easy administer , well tolerate relatively inexpensive . This multicentric , double blind , placebo control , randomize , parallel group study . Eligible subject already start IFN beta-1a ( Rebif® ) randomize 1:1 treatment either minocycline 2*100 mg daily add-on therapy placebo . The subject examine clinically baseline 12 , 24 , 48 , 72 96 week . Laboratory test ( hematology clinical chemistry ) perform baseline 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 96 week ( 4 , 8 , 36 , 60 84 week additional liver enzyme test schedule ) . The MRI ( T1-weighted T2-weighted ) treatment 96 week immunological study treatment 48 week perform limited number subject select center . OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : The effect minocycline versus placebo subject receive treatment IFN beta-1a time first document relapse Secondary Objectives : - To estimate effect minocycline versus placebo subject receive treatment IFN beta-1a mean number document relapse per subject year 2 - To estimate , limited number 120 subject pre-selected site , effect minocycline versus placebo subject receive treatment IFN beta-1a number new enlarge lesion T2-weighted MRI , change brain volume measure MRI Tertiary Objectives : - Time onset disability progression sustain least 6 month base change baseline EDSS subject RRMS recently start treatment IFN beta-1a . ( Disability progression define increase : 1.0 point EDSS EDSS &gt; = 1.0 baseline ; 1.5 point EDSS EDSS 0.0 baseline ) - Time sustain progression 2 point 1 Functional System 1 point 2 Functional Systems - The total number report relapse ( document undocumented ) . An undocumented relapse define appearance new symptom worsen old symptom , absence fever , least 24 hour could attribute MS activity , precede stability improvement least 30 day - The requirement treatment glucocorticoid due relapse - The time first relapse - The number relapse-free ( document undocumented relapse ) subject without progression - The disease activity measure integrated disability status scale ( IDSS ) - The number subject permanent loss disability 1.0 score EDSS , confirm 2 consecutive visit interval 6 month - The total area MS lesion T1 T2-weighted MRI - Analyze safety respect combination Rebif® minocycline - Rate dose reduction IFN beta-1a ( Rebif® ) - Relapse severity base EDSS IDSS - Immunological analysis limit number subject ( MRI subgroup ) - Frequency increase liver enzymes accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) II criterion</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects give write informed consent prior trial related activity . Trial related activity procedure would perform normal management subject Subjects stable disease without relapse last 30 day Subjects age 18 55 year ( include ) Subjects suffer definite RRMS accord Poser criterion ( clinical definite multiple sclerosis [ CDMS ] laboratory support definite multiple sclerosis [ LSDMS ] ) definite MS accord McDonald criterion Subjects start treatment Rebif® 44 mcg 3 month ago ( +/ 1 month ) include titration phase Subjects disability equivalent EDSS 5.5 less Subjects show clinical activity define least 1 documented relapse within last year ( A document relapse define development new exacerbation exist neurological symptom sign , absence fever , persist 48 hour previous period 30 day stable improving condition . The exacerbation must equivalent increase least 1 point 2 functional system increase 2 point 1 system , either pyramidal , cerebellar , brainstem , sensory , bowel bladder , visual , cerebral functional system increase least half point EDSS . Changes bowel bladder cerebral function solely responsible documentation relapse . The relapse must evaluate neurologist , retrospectively necessary ) Subjects must prepare consider able follow protocol whole trial period attend plan visit , even treatment withdrawn Female subject must either : postmenopausal surgically sterilize ; use hormonal contraceptive intrauterine device ( follow contraceptive allow : birth control pill , intrauterine device , depot injection gestagen , subdermal implant , hormonal vaginal ring transdermal depot patch ) ; sexually inactive duration study , neither pregnant breastfeeding ( confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) pregnancy test within 28 day Study Day 1 negative urine pregnancy test Study Day 1 . A pregnancy test require subject postmenopausal surgically sterilize ) Subjects condition might give rise similar symptom MS Subjects receive immunomodulatory immunosuppressive treatment 6 month prior inclusion trial ( obligatory prestudy 3 month [ +/ 1 month ] period Rebif® treatment include ) Subjects receive mitoxantrone total lymphoid radiation time Subjects receive treatment glucocorticoid adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) later 1 month prior inclusion trial Subjects experience relapse within 1 month prior inclusion trial Subjects suffer major depression Subjects alcohol drug dependency Subjects cardiac insufficiency , cardiomyopathy , significant cardiac dysrhythmias , unstable advanced ischemic heart disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] grade III IV ) , significant hypertension ( Blood Pressure &gt; 180/110 millimeter mercury [ mmHg ] ) Subjects renal insufficiency define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 time upper normal reference limit Subjects alanine aminotransferase ( ALAT ) asparagine aminotransferase ( ASAT ) ( either 1 1 2 measure ) level 2 time normal upper reference limit .
