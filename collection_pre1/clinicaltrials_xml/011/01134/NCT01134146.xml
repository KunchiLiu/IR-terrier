	<brief_title>Radical Pleurectomy/Decortication ( PD ) Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IMRT : IMRT technique deliver radiation allow radiation beam shape around target area . Radiation Dose Levels : If find eligible take part study , assign receive one two dos radiation therapy base join study . If first dose tolerate well first group participant study , next group participant receive second , high dose radiation . Practice Visit : You practice radiation visit 6-14 week surgery . At visit , compute tomography ( CT ) scan use study staff target receive IMRT . A mold also make around body mark make skin help position body correctly IMRT . This practice visit take 1-2 hour . IMRT Visits : Two ( 2 ) week practice radiation visit , begin receive IMRT . At visit , lie mold body make practice visit line IMRT use mark make practice visit . The IMRT deliver . You receive IMRT every weekday ( Monday-Friday ) 5 week . These visit last 45-60 minute . Study Visits : The following test procedure perform 1 time every week 5 week study : - You physical skin exam . - You lung function test . You also chest x-ray four-dimensional ( 4D ) CT scan check status disease last week receive IMRT . A 4D CT scan perform like CT scan , 4D CT scan , small black box ( size deck card ) place abdomen . This box allow view tumor see scan study staff . Length Study : You may receive IMRT 5 week . The IMRT stop early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-up Visits : One ( 1 ) month last dose IMRT , chest x-ray , lung function test , 4D CT scan physical exam . The chest x-ray CT scan perform check status disease . Two ( 2 ) month last dose IMRT , chest x-ray physical exam . Three ( 3 ) month last dose IMRT , chest x-ray , lung function test , physical exam , 4D CT scan regular CT scan chest . The chest x-ray CT scan perform check status disease . Long-term Follow-up : Every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month next 3 year , 1 time every year , lung function test , physical exam , alternate CT positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check status disease . This mean CT scan one visit , PET scan next visit , vice versa . This investigational study . IMRT give directly pleura patient MM pleurectomy currently use research purpose . Up 22 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must undergo radical pleurectomy/decortication enrol surgery . 2 . Patients must CT/PET scan prior surgery 3 . Patients baseline pulmonary function test quantitative V/Q scan prior radiation therapy , pulmonary function test one month three month completion radiation . To conservative , assume ipsilateral lung nonfunctional radiation treatment . Therefore , inclusion criterion baseline pulmonary function test similar require prior extrapleural pneumonectomy , follow : 4 . FEV1 &gt; /= 30 % predict postoperative ( ppoFEV1 ) ( patient underwent pneumonectomy ) base follow formula use quantitative V/Q scan : Predicted postresection FEV1 = FEV1 x % perfusion uninvolved lung quantitative V/Q scan report . 5 . DLCO &gt; 35 % predict 6 . Patients must able lie flat duration treatment planning session treatment . 7 . Patients must adequately recover surgery prepared begin radiation therapy 18 week pleurectomy/decortication . We anticipate patient ready radiation simulation 816 week surgery . 8 . Patients receive induction chemotherapy include study . 9 . **Note 2 6 represent standard criterion delivery radiation therapy pleurectomy/decortication , novel criterion purpose protocol . 10 . Age &gt; /= 18 . 11 . All woman childbearing potential ( A woman childbearing potential sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month [ i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ] ) male participant must practice effective contraception ( abstinence , oral , injectable , implantable hormonal contraceptive ; tubal ligation ; intrauterine device ; barrier contraceptive spermicide ; vasectomized partner ) throughout study . 12 . Calculated glomerular filtration rate 80 mL/min/1.73m^2 least 40 % renal contribution kidney contralateral treat hemithorax , demonstrate preradiation renal scan . 1 . Patients previous radiation therapy low neck , thorax upper abdomen , unless previous radiation therapy clearly current radiation field , determine treat physician 2 . Patients metastatic disease . 3 . Patients follow condition : 1 ) concomitant malignancy squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin , 2 ) Carcinoma situ cervix , 3 ) Uncontrolled acute congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association Class III IV . 4 ) Patients NCCN classify lowrisk prostate cancer</criteria>
