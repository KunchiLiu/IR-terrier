	<brief_summary>The overall goal study gain insight neural mechanism learn multiple task . By examination cognitive behavioral output performance learn several computer maze task , detailed examination neural activity obtain functional near-infrared ( fNIR ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) , may possible gain insight impact amount practice organization practice learn fine motor skill . This insight may provide direction well develop instructional rehabilitation protocol addition clinical intervention facilitate recovery function , relearn transfer cognitive fine motor skill base upon neural response physical practice .</brief_summary>
