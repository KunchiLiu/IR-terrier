	<brief_summary>Suspected pulmonary embolism ( PE ) frequent clinical problem remain diagnostic challenge . The diagnostic approach PE rely sequential diagnostic test , plasma D-dimer measurement , multi-slice compute tomography ( MSCT ) pulmonary angiography . In addition , diagnostic workup usually stratify accord clinical probability pulmonary embolism . Clinical probability fair predictive accuracy either evaluate implicitly clinical prediction rules1 useful identify patient low prevalence pulmonary embolism usually fully investigated non invasive tests.The D-dimer test extensively evaluate exclusion pulmonary embolism , particularly outpatient . ELISA D-dimer second-generation latex agglutination ( immuno-turbidimetric test ) remarkably high sensitivity prove safe first-line test association clinical probability rule pulmonary embolism outcome study . The clinical usefulness D-dimer define proportion patient pulmonary embolism may rule normal result determine specificity . However , ELISA second-generation latex agglutination ( immuno-turbidimetric test ) test quite limited overall specificity around 35 % 40 % . Therefore , many investigator try increase D-dimer threshold particular elderly patient increase rate patient diagnosis could exclude easy inexpensive test . Several study show D-dimer level increase age turn decrease specificity D-dimer test usual threshold elderly , thus less useful test exclude PE old patient . Indeed , ELISA D-dimer able rule PE 60 % patient age less 40 year , 5 % patient age 80.8 In study , raise cut-off value various point 600 ng/ml 1000 ng/ml increase specificity , come cost safety false negative test result . In analysis , however , stratification make clinical probability sample small . Recently , investigator retrospectively assess value progressive cut-off adjust age wide sample 1712 patient . This `` new '' cut-off define D-Dimer test positivity patient multiply patient 's age 10 . All patient D-Dimer level 500mg/ml , patient 50 year whose D-Dimer level inferior age multiply 10 consider negative D-Dimer test . The exact derivation validation `` new '' D-dimer cut-off describe hereafter . Using conventional cutoff , VIDAS® D-Dimer test negative ( 500 mg/ml ) 512/1712 patient ( 29.9 % ) none PE initial workup three-month follow-up period . Using cutoff adjust age ( cutoff D-Dimer test positivity equal age multiply ten , mg/ml ) , figure follow . D-Dimer level adjust cutoff 615/1712 patient ( 35.9 % , number need test 2.8 ) . This represent statistically significant 20.1 % increase number patient D-Dimer test consider negative , p=0.0002 . Of 615 patient , 5 PE initial workup ( 0.8 % , 95 percent confidence interval 0.4 1.9 % ) . These data suggest adopt progressive cut-off patient 50 year , could increase 20 % number patient PE could exclude without test , acceptable safety profile three-month thromboembolic rate remain low . Therefore , investigator plan prospective outcome study progressive `` new '' cut-off ( age X 10 ng/ml ) patient 50 year use . In multicentre study , clinical probability assess simplify revise Geneva revise score ( Table 1 ) ELISA D-dimer test perform [ Vidas D-Dimer Exclusion® test ( Biomérieux , Marcy l'Etoile , Paris , France ) ] . Patients non high clinical probability simplify revise Geneva score normal `` new '' D-dimer cut-off Vidas D-dimer Exclusion® , ( Biomerieux , Marcy l'Etoile , France ) consider PE , follow three-months ass possible VTE recurrence . The main outcome rate thromboembolic event formal 3-month follow-up patient anticoagulated basis strategy . Patients positive D-dimers investigate MSCT currently admit .</brief_summary>
