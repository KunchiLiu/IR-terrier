	<brief_summary>Background : - The investigational anti-cancer drug AZD6244 prevent protein find rectal cancer work properly , may slow tumor growth allow radiation chemotherapy treatment destroy cancer cell . Researchers interested determine whether AZD6244 use improve treatment outcome individual rectal cancer spread outside rectum surround pelvis . Objectives : - To determine safe effective dos AZD6244 , along radiation chemotherapy , treat rectal cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose rectal cancer spread outside inner wall rectum lymph node pelvis . Design : - Eligible participant screen physical examination , blood tumor sample , image study . - Participants receive AZD6244 twice day mouth 1 full week ( 7 day ) start radiation chemotherapy every week thereafter end radiation chemotherapy treatment . - Participants radiation therapy daily , 5 day per week , approximately 6 week . - Participants receive chemotherapy ( capecitabine ) twice daily , 5 day per week , approximately 6 week . - Approximately 4 8 week complete AZD6244 , radiation , chemotherapy treatment , participant may surgery remove tumor affect lymph node . This surgery part treatment deliver protocol . - Participants follow-up exam 3 week end treatment , every 3 month first year , second third year end treatment . These visit involve full medical examination image study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study AZD6244 Combination With Capecitabine Radiotherapy Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Local recurrence rectal cancer morbid difficult manage effectively . - Colorectal cancer frequently harbor RAS mutation EGF/EGFR over-expression . - AZD6244 orally available selective , adenosine triphosphate uncompetitive inhibitor MEK1/2 sensitize tumor cell radiation vitro vivo . Objectives : Primary - To define maximum tolerable dose AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate deliver BID , 7 day per week , combination radiation therapy ( RT ) Capecitabine patient locally advance adenocarcinoma rectum without distant metastasis . - To define dose-limiting toxicity toxicity profile associate administration AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate deliver BID , 7 day per week combination RT Capecitabine Secondary - To evaluate pharmacokinetics AZD6244 deliver alone combination Capecitabine 825 mg/m ( 2 ) PO BID . - To obtain exploratory information regard pathologic response rate obtain treatment MTD AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate combination Capecitabine 50.4 Gy RT . - To determine change phosphorylated ERK ( pERK ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell correlate change pERK rectal tumor set treatment AZD6244 . - To perform exploratory analysis determine presence activate mutation RAS BRAF tumor change plasma transform growth factor-alpha ( TGFalpha ) level tumor pERK/total ERK AZD6244 treatment alone AZD6244 combination Capecitabine RT predict stag pathologic response . Eligibility : - Histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced , non-metastatic adenocarcinoma rectum ( clinical stage T3AnyN , T4AnyN , AnyTN+ ) . - Age great equal 18 year . - ECOG performance status less equal 2 . - Normal organ marrow function . Design : - All patient receive 50.4 Gy RT pelvis rectal tumor deliver concurrently Capecitabine AZD6244 . AZD6244 deliver BID daily , 7 day per week , dose escalated fashion . AZD6244 begin one week prior Capecitabine RT conclude last day Capecitabine RT . - Capecitabine deliver 825 mg/m ( 2 ) PO every 12 hour , 5 day per week , start first day RT continue last day RT . - Biopsies tumor tissue obtain prior treatment , one week AZD6244 , one week AZD6244 , RT , Capecitabine correlative assay .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced , nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma rectum ( clinical stage T3 anyN , T4 anyN , AnyT N+ ) . Patients recurrent adenocarcinoma rectum clinically evident distant disease eligible deem pelvic nodal metastasis disease extend muscularis rectum . These patient evaluate Radiation Oncologist , Medical Oncologist Surgeon prior enrol study confirm anticipate resectability . These patient receive prior radiotherapy management rectal cancer . Age great equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 1 ( Karnofsky great equal 70 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet : great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin : within normal institutional limit except patient Gilbert must direct bilirubin less 1.0 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , six month completion radiation . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior entry . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Adequate contraception male patient use 6 month irradiation . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Willingness sign release medical record pertain previous future treatment rectal cancer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study lack recovery adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition AZD6244 agent use study . Previous MEK inhibitor use . Contraindications radiotherapy pelvis inflammatory bowel disease know genetic sensitivity ionize radiation ataxia telengiectasia . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients QTc interval great 470 msec factor increase risk QT prolongation arrhythmic event ( e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history long QT interval syndrome ) include heart failure meet New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class III IV definition exclude . Required use concomitant medication prolong QT interval . A comprehensive list agent potential cause QTc prolongation find http : //www.arizonacert.org/medicalpros/druglists/druglists.htm . Refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease ) , significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy . Known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency . History prior radiation pelvis For patient newly diagnose rectal cancer , prior therapy adenocarcinoma rectum exception divert colostomy require relieve obstruction ( include chemotherapy ) . Patients recurrent rectal cancer may undergo prior radiotherapy rectal adenocarcinoma receive therapy recurrence exception divert colostomy require relieve obstruction . History myocardial infarction within past 6 month history ventricular arrhythmia Uncontrolled hypertension Pregnant lactating female exclude</criteria>
