	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib/II study open label , multicenter study . The study divide two part : Phase I : open-label , dose escalation study F16IL2 combination paclitaxel patient solid tumour , bladder cancer , breast cancer , metastatic melanoma , mesothelioma , NSCLC , prostate cancer sarcoma amenable taxane therapy . Phase II : prospective , single-arm , multicentre study fix dose F16IL2 combination paclitaxel , equivalent stage 1 Simon two-stage phase II design , patient metastatic melanoma , breast cancer NSCLC amenable taxane therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer major cause cancer mortality , second lung cancer cause cancer death woman . The five-year survival rate localize breast cancer increase 80 percent 1950s 98 percent today . However , mortality rate advance form remain unsatisfactory . Indeed , extensive use mammography within screen program lead cancer detect earlier , early treatment may effective . A great understanding molecular biology genetic expression breast cancer therefore lead new pre-surgical post-surgical treatment , include hormone modulators monoclonal antibody . Many agent lead decreased mortality disease recurrence . F16 human recombinant antibody fragment scFv ( single chain Fragment variable ) format direct tenascin C , angiogenesis marker common solid tumor independent tumor type . ScFv ( F16 ) selectively localizes tumor tissue animal model demonstrate histologically mechanistic study involve mouse transfected orthotopic human tumour . IL2 , human cytokine interleukin-2 , potent stimulator immune response . It central role regulation T cell response effect immune cell natural killer cell , B cell , monocyte/macrophages neutrophil ( Smith , 1988 ) . IL2 induce tumor regression ability stimulate potent cell-mediated immune response vivo ( Rosenberg , 2000 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Phase I , cohorts 1 8 , study : For patient Phase I cohort 1 , i.e . patient receive F16IL2 alone , patient must amenable therapy paclitaxel/taxanes must consider Principal Investigator suitable candidate F16IL2 therapy alone . Histologically cytologically confirm solid cancer with/without evidence locally advance metastatic disease . For advanced solid cancer patient , patient may receive previous chemotherapy radiation therapy , must amenable paclitaxel treatment accord discretion principal investigator . For Phase I , cohorts 9 onwards : Histologically cytologically confirm bladder cancer , breast cancer , unresectable metastatic ( stage IV ) nonuveal melanoma , mesothelioma , NSCLC , prostate cancer sarcoma . Prior therapies metastatic disease allow , patient must amenable paclitaxel treatment accord discretion principal investigator . For breast cancer patient : patient suitable trastuzumab therapy ( i.e. , evidence HER2overexpressing disease , trastuzumab therapy exhaust HER2overexpressing disease ) . For Phase II study : Histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer , unresectable metastatic ( stage IV ) nonuveal melanoma , NSCLC . Prior therapies metastatic disease allow , patient must amenable paclitaxel treatment accord discretion principal investigator . For breast cancer patient : patient suitable trastuzumab therapy ( i.e. , evidence HER2overexpressing disease , trastuzumab therapy exhaust HER2overexpressing disease ) . For phase I II study : Patients age ≥ 18 year . Prior radiation therapy allow , irradiated area source measurable assessable disease . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Patients must least one unidimensionally measurable lesion compute tomography define RECIST criterion ( see Section APPENDIX A ) . This lesion must irradiate previous treatment . All acute toxic effect ( exclude alopecia ) prior therapy ( include surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy ) must resolve National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) ( v3.0 ) Grade ≤ 1 . Sufficient hematologic , liver renal function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L , platelet ≥ 100 x 10^9/L , haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.5 g/dl . Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 3 x upper limit reference range ( ULN ) , total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/gL unless liver involvement tumor , case transaminase level could 5 x ULN . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN 24 h creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min . Life expectancy least 12 week . Documented negative test human immunodeficiency virus . Negative serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential within 14 day start treatment . If childbearing potential , agreement use adequate contraceptive method ( e.g. , oral contraceptive , condom , adequate barrier control , intrauterine contraceptive device , sterilization ) begin screen visit continue 3 month follow last treatment study drug . Evidence personally sign dated Ethics Committeeapproved Informed Consent form indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect study . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure . Exclusion criterion : For metastatic melanoma patient : Primary ocular melanoma Previous concurrent cancer distinct primary site histology cancer evaluate study , cancer curatively treat &lt; 2 year prior study entry , except cervical carcinoma situ , treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor ( TA , TIs &amp; TI ) . Presence active infection ( e.g . require antibiotic therapy ) severe concurrent disease , , opinion investigator , would place patient undue risk interfere study . Presence known brain metastasis . If patient symptomatic , negative CT scan within two month study begin require . However , presence control brain metastasis ( i.e. , evaluate SD PR radiotherapy ) allow . History chronic hepatitis B C , chronic active hepatitis active autoimmune disease . History within last year acute subacute coronary syndrome include myocardial infarction , unstable severe stable angina pectoris . Heart insufficiency ( &gt; Grade II , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) criterion ) . Irreversible cardiac arrhythmia require permanent medication . LVEF &lt; /= 50 % and/or abnormality observe baseline MUGA , ECHO ECG investigation . Uncontrolled hypertension . Ischemic peripheral vascular disease ( Grade IIbIV ) . Severe rheumatoid arthritis . Severe diabetic retinopathy . History allograft stem cell transplantation . Major trauma include surgery within 4 week administration study treatment . Known history allergy IL2 , taxanes , intravenously administer human proteins/peptides/antibodies . Pregnancy breast feed . Female patient must agree use effective contraception , surgically sterile postmenopausal . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Chemotherapy ( standard experimental ) within 4 week administration study treatment . Radiation therapy within 6 week administration study treatment . Treatment investigational study drug within six week begin treatment F16IL2 . Previous vivo exposure monoclonal antibody biological therapy 6 week administration study treatment . Growth factor immunomodulatory agent within 7 day administration study treatment . Neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 . The chronic administration low dose corticosteroid allow : however maximum allow dose per day exceed 5 mg prednisone ( equivalent ) meant address cancer symptom ( e.g. , pain , dyspnoea , lack appetite ) . A suspected presence chronic inflammatory disease consider exclusion criterion . Any condition opinion investigator could hamper compliance study protocol .</criteria>
