	<detailed_description>The researcher propose randomize controlled trial evaluate well intervention , Planned Care Obesity &amp; Risk Reduction ( Planned CORR ) , support primary care treatment obesity adult least one cardiovascular risk factor ( CVRF ) . We assess well create initial sustained improvement BMI metabolic , anthropometric behavioral outcome obese adult , age 25 70 one follow CVRFs : hypertension , smoke metabolic syndrome . Planned CORR integrate intervention component base behavior change theory delivery strategy base Chronic Care Model ( Wagner et al , 2001 ; also call `` Planned Care Model '' ) design incorporate intervention principle use successfully treat obesity . Planned CORR intend compatible variety primary care setting include minimal resource devote patient education obese adult receive usual medical care . Study participants 380 woman men , age 25-70 meet entry criterion obesity ( Class I &amp; II ; BMI 30-45 ) plus one CVRFs . We anticipate approximately 40 % Hispanic recruit equal number woman men power study analysis gender . Planned CORR step care intervention begin computer-assisted assessment tailor action planning , physician nurse practitioner counseling , intensive `` first step '' 4 month lifestyle modification deliver via monthly in-person session phone call weekly web mail ( base preference ) tutorials.CVRFs manage concurrently accord recognize evidence-based protocol . Successive 4-month step involve , , less intensive intervention depend clinical response . The primary aim evaluate effect 12 &amp; 24 month Planned CORR BMI compare enhance usual care . Secondary aim evaluate : CVRF outcomes ; physiological , metabolic , behavioral , psychosocial factor related obesity CVRFs ; quality life , depression cost-effectiveness ; medical care quality , patient , provider &amp; staff satisfaction , process measure relevant implementation primary care . Post study aim disseminate knowledge gain intervention conference publication , disseminate Planned CORR proven channel health care intervention dissemination .</detailed_description>
