	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn CMC-544 give alone , possibly give combination rituximab , help control disease patient ALL . The safety study drug ( ) also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CMC-544 Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : CMC-544 monoclonal antibody ( substance locate bind cancer cell ) . It design attach C22 , molecule find cancer cell ALL . This may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab monoclonal antibody design attach leukemia cell activate series event may cause cancer cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive CMC-544 vein 60 minute Day 1 study `` cycle '' 60 minute lower dose Days 1 , 8 15 cycle , depend join study . No matter dose schedule , receive total dosage CMC-544 . Each study cycle 3-4 week . If disease respond CMC-544 2 cycle , begin receive rituximab . On Day 1 Cycle 3 , receive rituximab vein 8 hour . On Day 2 Cycle 3 , receive CMC-544 alone vein 60 minute . Then , start Day 1 Cycle 4 , begin receive rituximab vein 8 hour CMC-544 vein 60 minute least 2-4 hour receive rituximab . You receive combination 1 time every week . Your dose study drug ( ) may change depend side effect may . Study Visits : You study visit within 1 week Day 1 study cycle . At study visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - You ask feel drug may take . - You ECG receive treatment CMC-544 ( + 2 day ) . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) may draw test study drug ( ) may affect cancer cell receive CMC-544 infusion . - If receive rituximab history irregular heartbeat chest pain ( due heart trouble ) , ECGs perform start rituximab , infusion , within 2 hour infusion . Rituximab infusion stop experience serious episode irregular heartbeat . - If receive rituximab , may examine sign symptom bowel obstruction ( blockage ) and/or perforation ( hole intestine , may cause content leak ) . Appropriate radiologic test surgical consults perform need . Blood ( 1 tablespoon time ) drawn 1-3 time week Cycles 1 2 , least 1 time every week cycle routine test . Your doctor may decide 3 blood draw Cycles 1 2 . You bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy Days 14-21 ( +/- 3 day ) Cycle 1 every 1-2 cycle check status disease . You may additional bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy doctor feel necessary . Length Study : You may receive CMC 544 without rituximab 12 month . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect Follow-up Visits : You follow-up visit 30 day last dose study drug ( ) . At visit , ask side effect may . If make clinic visit , do phone member study staff . The phone call last 10 minute . This investigational study . Rituximab FDA approve commercially available treatment lymphoid cancer . Neither CMC-544 CMC-544/rituximab combination FDA approve commercially available . Their use study investigational . Up 90 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Previously treat ALL ( include Burkitt 's lymphoma lymphoblastic lymphoma ) relapse primary refractory . Patients first relapse eligible regardless first remission duration . At least 10 patient Salvage 12 treated assess antiALL response precisely . 2 . Age 16 year old . Pediatric patient ( &lt; 16 year old ) allow study safety establish , least 10 adult patient receive 1 cycle . 3 . Zubrod performance status 03 . 4 . Adequate liver function ( bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5 mg/dL SGPT SGOT &lt; /= 3 x upper limit normal [ ULN ] , unless consider due tumor ) , renal function ( creatinine &lt; /= 2 mg/dL ) . Even organ function abnormality consider due tumor , upper limit bilirubin &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dL creatinine &lt; /= 3 mg/dL . 5 . Male female patient childbearing potential agree use effective barrier method birth control ( e.g. , latex condom , diaphragm , cervical cap , etc . ) avoid pregnancy . Female patient need negative serum urine pregnancy test within 14 day study start ( applies patient childbearing potential . Nonchildbearing define &gt; /= 1 year postmenopausal surgically sterilize ) . 1 . Patient active heart disease ( NYHA class &gt; /= 3 assessed history physical examination ) . 2 . Patients cardiac ejection fraction ( measure either MUGA echocardiogram ) &lt; 45 % exclude . 3 . Patients receive chemotherapy . Patients must previous therapy &gt; /= 2 week must recover acute toxicity ( grade 1 less ) previous therapy prior enrollment ( consent signing ) . ( Concurrent therapy central nervous system [ CNS ] prophylaxis treatment CNS relapse permit ) . Treatment may start early necessitated patient 's medical condition ( e.g . rapidly progressive disease ) follow discussion Principal Investigator . 4 . Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant previous 4 month . 5 . Peripheral lymphoblast &gt; 50 x 10^9/L . 6 . Pregnant breastfeeding patient exclude . 7 . Patients know hepatitis B exclude .</criteria>
