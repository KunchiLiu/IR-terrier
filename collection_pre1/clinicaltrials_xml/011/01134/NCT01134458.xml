	<brief_summary>The investigator propose evaluation ass three important component risk communication : 1. provide patient personalize risk communication use risk calculator develop FIMDM health information take Living Coronary Artery Disease program 2. provide personalize tailored patient feedback help initiate maintain specific cardiovascular CVD-related behavior ( e.g. , medication adherence , exercise , diet , smoke cessation ) reduce risk . 3. evaluate feedback incorporate clinical care examine 3 month patient outcome provider response risk information .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Personalized Cardiovascular Risk Information Initiate Maintain Health Behavior Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients high risk CVD event frequently underestimate risk . Programs improve CVD outcomes largely focused single risk factor contextualize information patient 's global risk . An easy , accessible strategy address global CVD risk base personalize risk communication feedback assistance initiate maintain health behavior several advantage , formally test . A patient 's perceive risk stroke heart attack important factor understand motivation risk reduce behavior . Lower perceive risk associate poor adherence recommend health behavior . Additionally , person 's belief risk disease increase likelihood inform activated patient , figure prominently model health behavior ( e.g. , Health Belief Model ) . People tend underestimate risk ; Therefore provide accurate risk communication potential activate patient initiate maintain behavior change .</detailed_description>
