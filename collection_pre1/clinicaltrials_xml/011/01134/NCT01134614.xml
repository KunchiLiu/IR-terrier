	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give ipilimumab without sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) work treat patient stage III stage IV melanoma remove surgery . Ipilimumab work activate patient 's immune system fight cancer . Colony-stimulating factor , sargramostim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect treatment . It yet know whether give ipilimumab together sargramostim effective ipilimumab alone treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With Without Sargramostim Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival combination GM-CSF ( sargramostim ) plus ipilimumab ipilimumab alone patient advance melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival , response rate , safety tolerability combination GM-CSF plus ipilimumab ipilimumab alone patient advance melanoma . II . To explore utility immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) prospectively patient receive ipilimumab . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive induction therapy comprise ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC ) daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . After 12 week induction treatment , anti-tumor response assess patient receive maintenance therapy comprise ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 sargramostim SC daily day 1-14 . Treatment ipilimumab repeat every 12 week treatment sargramostim repeat every 21 day . After 12 week maintenance therapy , anti-tumor response reassess patient responsive stable disease continue maintenance therapy disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive induction therapy comprise ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . After 12 week induction treatment , anti-tumor response assess patient receive maintenance therapy ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment ipilimumab repeat every 12 week . After 12 week maintenance therapy , anti-tumor response reassess course repeat every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
