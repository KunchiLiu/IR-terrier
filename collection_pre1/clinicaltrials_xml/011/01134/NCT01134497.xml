	<brief_summary>In `` randomised Phase II trial '' patient receive carboplatin , half randomly select receive ZD4054 . The half also receive dummy pill placebo , accurately assess much extra benefit ZD4054 may give . The trial recruit 132 patient metastatic breast cancer across UK ass whether add ZD4054 carboplatin delay progression disease . It also show whether side effect add ZD4054 carboplatin chemotherapy acceptable . Because ZD4054 previously give carboplatin population , Stage 1 study 6 patient receive ZD4054 carboplatin . If untoward side effect carboplatin ZD4054 trial proceed Stage 2 126 patient randomise receive carboplatin either ZD4054 placebo ; neither patient doctor know whether receive ZD4054 placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin With Without ZD4054 Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In UK 41,000 patient diagnose breast cancer year . More patient survive breast cancer , mostly due early detection improvement treatment . Nevertheless , 6 % patient cancer already spread part body first diagnose ; 30 % patient cancer come back elsewhere body initial treatment . Once spread part body , breast cancer incurable , patient live , average , 24 month . The aim treat patient metastatic breast cancer prolong improve day day life . A number different chemotherapy drug available treatment metastatic breast cancer . There , however , still need develop new treatment . The aim trial use new drug call ZD4054 combine establish chemotherapy drug ( carboplatin ) see whether prolongs period patient live cancer keep control . ZD4054 new , oral drug may help slow cancer growth . It work block growth control specific protein cancer cell call endothelins . Endothelins act bind endothelin receptor , presence receptor find 45 % breast cancer case . ZD4054 endothelin receptor blocker . We hope show add new drug increase effectiveness carboplatin . We know trial cancer similar drug may able slow growth tumour . Metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) remain incurable little change long term outcome . Chemotherapy use improve symptom prolong survival patient advance breast cancer . Nevertheless , tumours inevitably progress clinical response rate subsequent chemotherapy agent disappointing . There , therefore , need continued clinical research new strategy enhance effectiveness currently available chemotherapy agent improve survival . The endothelin pathway implicate number oncogenic pathway . ET-1 ETAR frequently over-expressed breast cancer prognostic poor outcome . Inhibition endothelin pathway enhances cytotoxicity combine chemotherapy agent carboplatin pre-clinical model . ZD4054 specific inhibitor ETAR represent novel therapeutic target breast cancer . This study investigate whether ZD4054 , oral endothelin A receptor ( ETAR ) inhibitor , combination carboplatin chemotherapy , sufficient activity warrant future Phase III trial patient advanced/metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>
