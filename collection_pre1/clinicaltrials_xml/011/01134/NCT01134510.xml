	<brief_summary>Organ transplantation offer hope normal life patient end-stage renal disease dialysis ( ESRD ) . For highly-sensitized patient , patient antibody human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) , transplantation extremely difficult impossible since pre-formed antibody cause severe rejection loss transplant organ . Approximately 30 % transplant list U.S. consider sensitize ( detectable antibody HLA antigen ) . These anti-HLA ( anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen antibody ) pose significant barrier transplantation recently successfully address use desensitization therapy IVIG , rituximab and/or plasmapheresis ( PE ) . Despite success therapy , post-transplant antibody mediate rejection ( AMR ) chronic Antibody Mediated Rejection ( CAMR ) remain significant problem . Recent data suggest addition Berinert ( C1 Inhibitor ) post-transplant treatment regimen may significantly reduce incidence Antibody Mediation Rejection . Twenty highly-sensitized patient undergone desensitization treatment await kidney transplant enrol study . Once transplanted patient start standard care post-transplant immunosuppressive protocol . In addition patient receive Berinert 20 units/ kg daily x 3 day , twice weekly x 3 week . At end Berinert treatment kidney biopsy perform . Subjects follow 6 month assess safety efficacy study protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Single center , Phase I/II , randomize The trial examine safety efficacy human C1 INH give post-transplant reduce prevent complement-dependent , antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) 20 subject ( adult ) highly-HLA sensitize ( HS ) , ( Panel Reactive Antibodies &gt; 30 % ( PRA ) , undergone desensitization intravenous immunoglobin ( IVIG ) + rituximab and/or plasmapheresis await Living donor ( LD ) / Deceased Donor ( DD ) kidney transplant . Once transplant offer entertain , donor-specific crossmatch perform detect anti-HLA antibody donor-specific anti-HLA antibody ( DSA ) associate acute rejection graft loss . ( These anti-HLA ( anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen antibody ) antibody may result naturally previous pregnancy , transfusion , prior transplant . ) If acceptable crossmatches Donor Specific Antibody level see desensitization , patient proceed Living Donor/Deceased Donor transplantation . Patients receive transplant pre-transplant lab obtain C1 INH level , Complement 3 ( C3 ) Complement 4 ( C4 ) transplant . In addition standard post-transplant immunosuppressive protocol , participate patient receive placebo 20 Units/kg C1 INH twice weekly X 4 week . At end treatment , protocol biopsy perform assess allograft evidence Antibody Mediated Rejection , include C4d staining . Since ~25 % highly sensitized patient experience Antibody Mediated Rejection post-transplant 85 % Antibody Mediated Rejection episodes occur 1st post-transplant month , feel assessment potential impact C1 INH therapy best assessed time period . After completion C1 INH therapy , patient follow additional 6 month ass allograft function Antibody Mediated Rejection episodes well Donor Specific Antibodies . The subject follow determine proportion develop evidence Antibody Mediated Rejection within 6 month completion study . In addition ass transplant patient determine number sustain viable function kidney allograft 6 month . All subject evaluate intent-to-treat basis . The subject accrual rate limit five subject per month initial three month assure safety subject . Repeat laboratory perform completion C1 INH therapy determine effect level correlation potential event .</detailed_description>
