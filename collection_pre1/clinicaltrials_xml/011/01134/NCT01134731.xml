	<brief_title>Paliperidone Lithium Treatment Suicidality - Treatment Indication Epigenetic Regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : The atypical antipsychotic , paliperidone , initiate simultaneously antidepressant , superior lithium plus antidepressant early intervention suicidality patient Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . The goal aim examine clinical efficacy paliperidone reduce suicidality , focus early intervention . The hypothesis base recently complete pilot study find atypical antipsychotic , risperidone , rapid onset action reduce suicidality patient MDD . In view shortage acute pharmacological management suicidality , study provide important new treatment option life threaten psychiatric condition . Specific Aim 2 : Both paliperidone lithium regulate epigenetics stabilize DNA methylation , correlate inhibition glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) activity improve clinical symptom . This exploratory aim develop base recent finding DNA methylation involve regulation mood , behavior , cognition , enzyme epigenetic mechanism - DNA methyltransferase-1 ( DNMT1 ) regulate therapeutic target Glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) . We measure expression DNMTs DNA methylation global DNA , Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , Tropomyosin receptor kinase B ( TrkB ) peripheral blood study drug treatment , analyze correlation GSK3 activity clinical symptom response treatment . Outcomes study provide important new information future development effective treatment option suicidality target epigenetic regulation .</detailed_description>
