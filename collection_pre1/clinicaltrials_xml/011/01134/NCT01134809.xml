	<brief_summary>Background : Skeletal muscle waste decrease muscle mass occur result alteration body 's mechanism make break muscle protein . In animal model , pathway term 'ubiquitin-proteasome pathway ' ( UPP ) primarily responsible regulation skeletal muscle protein loss waste condition infection ( sepsis ) . Skeletal muscle waste notice patient major surgery due inflammatory reaction trigger special group protein call cytokine ( inflammatory protein ) , result reduce muscle strength , impaired capacity fight infection , change bowel function , increase clinical complication prolong recovery . Major surgery also lead decreased sensitivity hormone know insulin , result 'diabeteslike'state . We hypothesize susceptibility patient undergo major abdominal surgery , skeletal muscle waste insulin resistance , determine stress response surgery time , lead change pathway make break muscle protein , namely Akt/Foxo signal UPP . Therefore , aim study establish underlying mechanism skeletal muscle waste insulin resistance patient undergo major abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skeletal Muscle Wasting Insulin Resistance Following Surgical Stress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental plan Fifteen adult patient undergo major open elective abdominal surgery include nonrandomized study . Objectives : 1 . To study expression protein metabolites involved UPP mediate protein degradation , blood muscle biopsy sample . 2 . To correlate effect surgery release bacteria blood bowel . The analysis sample include follow technique , namely , RTPCR , ELISA , western blot metabolomics . Establishing association signal mechanisms expression individual proteins secondary inflammation follow surgery infection would enable application suitable therapeutic strategy could reduce inflammatory response benefit patient undergo surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult patient undergo major open elective gastrointestinal surgery last 3 hour eligible study . Patients : 1. undergoing emergency surgery 2. suffering chronic illness , ( e.g . diabetes ) debilitate disease 3. long term antiinflammatory drug , ( e.g . NSAIDS , Steroids , immunosuppressant ) 4. long term antibiotic 5. statin 6. full therapeutic dose anticoagulant , aspirin &gt; 325 mg/day , clopidogrel &gt; 75 mg/day 7. suffer bleed diathesis 8. unable give consent 9. pregnant breastfeeding</criteria>
