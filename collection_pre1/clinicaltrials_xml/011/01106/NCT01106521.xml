	<brief_summary>Women find early stage breast cancer cancer surgically remove followed radiation treatment entire breast , five time per week several week . The radiation treatment prevents cancer grow back create skin burn . Several study show necessary treating whole breast . The investigator team pioneer new therapy realize permanent implantation tiny radioactive seed surgical cavity single one hour procedure light anesthesia . Patients live normal life receive radiation treatment . The result first clinical trial 67 patient show treatment well tolerate efficient . The purpose study offer treatment several place increase cohort patient 420 capture rare complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Registry Study Permanent Breast Seed Implant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For early stage breast cancer , accelerate partial breast irradiation alternative treatment option whole breast irradiation breast conserve surgery . Our group previously report result Phase I/II study permanent breast seed implant ( PBSI ) use palladium-103 seed alternative whole breast radiotherapy well select breast cancer patient . The procedure realise single session light sedation local freezing . After median FU 54 month patient recur cohort 67 patient , acute delayed side effect compare favourably external beam radiotherapy . Yet study single centre study sample size allow evaluate appropriately risk serious adverse event ( SAE ) . The current study propose evaluate SAE multicentre large cohort 420 patient .</detailed_description>
