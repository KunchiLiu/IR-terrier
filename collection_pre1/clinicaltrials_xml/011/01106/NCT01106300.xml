	<brief_summary>Each year , 110,000 English/Welsh patient admit Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) . Many face prolong disability result . Over two third moderate-extreme limitation usual activity year later , one-third severely affected , unable continue `` activity , '' live independently . Quite known- severe muscle waste n't may play important role . We hope find , measure degree wasting patient , seek potential cause . We shall also address mechanism waste , may reflect altered balance activity muscle growth pathways break muscle . We 'll collect data , take regular blood test , scan leg muscle ultrasound machine , analyse small muscle sample . In addition , 'll accurately objectively measure impaired patient become , use specialist questionnaire , special monitoring equipment , simple walking test occasional special ( 'Cardio-Pulmonary ' ) exercise test . We 'll try see badly activity limit , tease whether muscle weakness play significant role . Finally , keep muscle work ( hard unconscious/drowsy/bed-bound ) may maintain muscle mass , 'll see whether maintain muscle activity use painless electrical stimulation help .</brief_summary>
