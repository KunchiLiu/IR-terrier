	<brief_summary>The purpose study test combination chemotherapy drug Gemcitabine , bevacizumab , docetaxel valproic acid treat patient metastatic sarcoma . Valproic acid use people seizure prevent seizure happen ; however , use cancer investigational . This study help define proper dose valproic acid . We assess safety valproic acid combination chemotherapy drug check possible side effect . Valproic acid may improve function chemotherapy drug cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) heterogeneous group benign malignant tumor various supportive tissue arise mesoderm . There 56 known subtypes classify tissue origin . Soft tissue sarcoma account 1 % human malignancy . These tumor share common mesenchymal origin vasculature . Many signal pathway involve angiogenesis also drive sarcoma tumor cell growth . Autocrine paracrine vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) - platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -mediated growth play role pathogenesis several sarcoma subtypes1 . Despite promising preclinical data support role angiogenesis inhibition sarcoma , relatively clinical trial evaluate antiangiogenic therapy sarcoma . Most study use anti-angiogenic drug take phase I trials refractory solid tumor show lack response sarcoma . This may due inadequate dose , wrong sequence treatment lack study combination treatment . Given heterogeneity sarcoma may benefit certain subgroup easily miss . A recent clinical trial show improved cytotoxic cell kill response rate epigenetically modify tumor environment prior chemotherapy . It believe efficacy angiogenesis inhibitor show greatly improve combined anticancer drug . Tumor metastasis highly dependent angiogenesis progress metastatic cascade include primary tumor growth , modification tumor cell growth behavior formation new blood vessel . This angiogenic switch believe result change balance angiogenesis stimulators , inhibitor modulators present site tumor growth . These change due genetic alteration involve RAS , RAF , MYC , SRC , EGFR HER-2 tumor suppressor gene epigenetic circumstance hypoxia , inflammation hormonal stimulation . It clear vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) emerge key stimulatory molecule promote angiogenesis variety human malignancy . Other pro-angiogenic factor induce amplified presence hypoxia hypoglycemia , inflammatory cytokine alter cell-cell contact . Thus would interest combine epigenetic modifier like Valproic acid , histone deacetylase inhibitor , Bevacizumab , anti-angiogenic agent VEGF standard chemotherapy ( Gemcitabine /docetaxel ) well modulate cytotoxic effect sarcomas .</detailed_description>
