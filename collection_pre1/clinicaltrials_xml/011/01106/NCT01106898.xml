	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well give cyclophosphamide paclitaxel without trastuzumab work treat woman stage I stage II breast cancer undergone surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy , trastuzumab , chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclophosphamide Paclitaxel With Without Trastuzumab Treating Women With Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity ability complete plan treatment dose-dense regimen cyclophosphamide paclitaxel without trastuzumab patient newly diagnose stage I-II breast cancer . II . To estimate recurrence free survival dose-dense regimen cyclophosphamide paclitaxel without trastuzumab patient newly diagnose stage I-II breast cancer . OUTLINE : SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY ( Her-2 neu positive patient ) : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 5 course every 21 day 14 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
