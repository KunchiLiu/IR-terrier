	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize time maturation neutrophil extracellular trap ( NET ) formation capability polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMNs ) isolate newborn premature term infant well infant &lt; 1 year age undergoing elective surgery . This study also determine whether NETs contribute pathogenesis necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) . We hypothesize NET formation contributes pathogenesis NEC inappropriately release degradative protein tissue destructive enzyme inflammatory milieu premature infant gastrointestinal tract follow bacterial translocation . We also hypothesize delay NEC development premature infant ( 3rd - 4th week life ) compare at-risk term infant ( 1st week life ) result developmental delay PMN ability form NETs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation Newborn Infants Risk Necrotizing Enterocolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prematurely born infant risk necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) , common gastrointestinal emergency encounter newborn intensive care unit . This disease occur 5 - 10 % infant bear less 30 week gestation le 1500 gram birth weight . In patient , NEC routinely develop 3rd 4th week life . NEC rarely occur infant bear close term ; patient NEC usually develop 1st week life . So far , one explain inverse relationship gestational age birth delay NEC development . Recently , laboratory describe first time inherent deficiency innate immunity newborn infant - failure neutrophil extracellular trap formation . Neutrophil extracellular trap NETs complex lattice extracellular chromatin DNA decorate anti-microbial protein degradative enzyme trap kill microbe . When neutrophils newborn infant develop ability form NETs whether maturation NET formation correlate development NEC risk infant remain unknown . We therefore undertaken follow study best describe prospective , vitro longitudinal cellular biology study LPS/PAF-stimulated PMNs isolate cord peripheral blood premature infant risk NEC term infant consider risk NEC . We also assay NET formation gastrointestinal tissue sample obtain time surgery severe NEC enrol prematurely born infant . These study first kind aim answer important question .</detailed_description>
