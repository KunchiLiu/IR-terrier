	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocyte kill melanoma cell . Treating lymphocytes interleukin-21 laboratory may help lymphocyte kill tumor cell put back body . Giving therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together cyclophosphamide aldesleukin may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose give therapeutic autologous lymphocytes together cyclophosphamide aldesleukin treat patient metastatic melanoma</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety toxicity adoptively transfer interleukin ( IL ) -21 modulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ( CTL ) target melanoma associate antigen patient follow cyclophosphamide conditioning . II . Evaluate functional numeric vivo persistence adoptively transfer IL-21 modulate CTL factor contribute immunopotentiation patient receive IL-21 modulate CTL follow cyclophosphamide conditioning . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antitumor effect adoptively transfer IL-21 modulate CD8+ antigen-specific CTL follow cyclophosphamide condition post-infusion IL-2 . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -3 -2 follow infusion IL-21 modulate , melanoma antigen recognize T cell ( MART ) -1 specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes 30-60 minute day 0 . Beginning within 24 hour T-cell infusion , patient receive low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8-10 week .</detailed_description>
