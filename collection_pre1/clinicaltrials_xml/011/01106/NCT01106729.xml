	<brief_summary>This study trace path natural plant pigment , ( cyanidin-3-glucoside ; C3G ) , human body consumption . C3G abundant naturally occur anthocyanin family plant pigment responsible red purple colour many fruit vegetable . Anthocyanins promote potentially beneficial heart-health also anti-cancer property , however little know body process compound eaten clear digestive system . The investigator study aim answer question , , unravel may benefit everyone 's health . In BBSRC fund study , 8 healthy ( 18-45y ) male participant recruit one day feed study ( last 8 hour ) establish route clearance anthocyanins body . After consent obtain , participant screen establish health ( NHS clinical staff ) . Eligible participant ask consume low anthocyanin diet 7 day attend study day Clinical Research &amp; Trials Unit ( CRTU , University East Anglia ) . Participants attend fast state ( least 8h water ) ask provide urine ( total morning void ) faecal ( within previous 72h ) sample . Participants consume C3G capsule blood breath sample collect regular interval consumption ( 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 6 hour ) . The capsule roughly size commercial vitamin-C tablet ( 500mg ) . Participants return fast state follow 2 morning provide urine , faeces , breath blood sample . Low anthocyanin meal provide throughout study day follow 2 morning . Participants reimburse inconvenience</brief_summary>
