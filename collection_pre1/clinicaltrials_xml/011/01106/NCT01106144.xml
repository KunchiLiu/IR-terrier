	<brief_summary>The main component treatment acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) consist anthracycline ( daunorubicin idarubicin ) cytarabine . Inter-individual variability transport/metabolism chemotherapeutic agent several genetic pathway involve drug action might associate different response follow treatment AML usually consist chemotherapy and/or transplantation . One potential pathway involve drug action DNA repair pathway , accordingly single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) DNA repair machinery pathway might predictive marker therapy outcomes AML . Several gene involve DNA repair machinery 1 ) Nonhomologous end joining ( NHEJ ) pathway involved G1/S phase , 2 ) Homologous recombinational repair ( HRR ) pathway involved S/G2 phase . XRCC4 , LIG4 , MRN ATM well know gene involve NHEJ pathway , MRE11 , RAD50 , NBS1 ( MRN ) , RAD51 , XRCC2 , XRCC3 , RAD51B , RAD51C , RAD 51D , RAD52 RAD54 know associated HRR pathway . A study suggest SNPs DNA repair pathway involved susceptibility secondary AML develop chemotherapy autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation , thus SNP marker could become predictive marker secondary AML . However , never investigate multiple candidate pathway simultaneously relateively large number patient . Accordingly , current study attempt investigate potential role genotype marker multiple candidate pathway , esp . focused DNA repair machinery , respect response follow chemotherapy survival AML patient . Total 500 archive sample patient diagnose acute myeloid leukemia Samsung Medical Center , Seoul , Korea include , genomic DNAs extract examined genotype candidate SNPs involve DNA repair pathway . Then statistical analysis pursue single marker analysis , haplotype analysis construction genetic risk model base multivariate analysis .</brief_summary>
