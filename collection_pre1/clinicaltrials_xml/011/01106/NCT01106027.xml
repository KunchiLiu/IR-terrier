	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether dose regimen eculizumab addition standard posttransplant care positive crossmatch decease donor kidney transplant recipient reduce incidence acute humoral rejection ( AHR ) . Patients include study demonstrable anti-human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antibody specific decease donor . It hypothesis blockade terminal complement activation eculizumab time transplant combination current protocol reduce incidence AHR recipient decease donor kidney transplant anti-donor HLA antibody</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dosing Regimen Eculizumab Added Conventional Treatment Positive Crossmatch Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A strongly positive crossmatch long consider absolute contraindication kidney transplantation patient anti-HLA antibody never able receive kidney transplant . Over past decade , significant progress make overcome early antibody-mediated renal allograft injury . Despite best effort , transplantation patient still complicate high rate acute humoral rejection . While successfully transplant 250 patient DSA use live donor , apply protocol recipient decease donor problematic . This primarily due fact contrast living donation , time decease donor kidney transplant plan . This lead inadequate time perform multiple pretransplant plasmapheresis treatment need achieve safe level DSA transplant . Thus , major unmet need develop therapy allow successful transplantation decease donor kidney recipient DSA .</detailed_description>
