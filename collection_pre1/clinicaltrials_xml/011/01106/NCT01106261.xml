	<brief_summary>Patients treat successfully bowel cancer ( colorectal cancer ) sometimes go develop nodule disease another part body . If disease find related original cancer call metastasis . Some patient develop one metastases particularly lungs liver . There grow trend remove lung metastasis operation , belief help patient live long , however scientific study prove . There also little publish information side effect surgery affect subsequent daily living . This feasibility study determine whether possible conduct large randomise controlled trial investigate value pulmonary metastasectomy ( surgery remove lung metastasis ) patient successfully treated colorectal cancer . There two stage consent randomisation process . Firstly , patient invite consent full range investigation assess suitability surgery . If find suitable , invited consent randomisation active monitoring disease active monitoring pulmonary metastasectomy . Patients follow regularly 5 year assess disease status measure quality life lung function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial Pulmonary Metastasectomy Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one three commonest solid tumour . Approximately 100 case diagnose day UK . In 2006 , 37,514 case colorectal cancer diagnose . The increase use CT scan routine follow patient lead early diagnosis isolate and/or subclinical lung nodule widespread adoption pulmonary metastasectomy select case . A survey practice Europe show pulmonary metastasectomy commonly perform criterion vary widely . About 300 operation carry annually UK PulMiCC open 'feasibility ' study . Although well-established clinical practice previous randomise controlled trial effect lung metastasectomy survival doubt clinical effectiveness . The recent systematic review meta-analysis concludes pulmonary metastasectomy associate high likelihood recurrence , double recurrence rate three adverse prognostic factor : ( ) one metastasis , ( ii ) interoperative interval ( primary resection lung metastasectomy ) less three year , ( iii ) elevate CEA . In prospective registry capture 60 % Spanish practice two year period limit commonly exceed . In RCT show recurrence detect earlier CT and/or CEA surveillance result liver lung metastasectomy operation perform . However , operation provide survival benefit , within RCT . The uncertainty practice set British Medical Journal 2014 . Pulmonary metastasectomy thus part big question effectiveness surgery metastases colorectal cancer . There know unfavourable prognostic factor include number metastasis length time take become evident radiologically : ( ) solitary nodule appear long interval remove instance , ( b ) surgery rarely advocate multiple metastasis present time surgery primary colorectal cancer appear soon . These scenario represent opposite end continuum favourable adverse factor survival resection pulmonary metastasis . Most patient operate fall extremes evident `` yes '' towards one end continuum `` '' towards must cross zone clinical uncertainty . PulMiCC aim investigate outcome follow pulmonary metastasectomy patient accept clinical uncertainty , provide evidence guide practice future . It also show previously trial require patient consider randomisation treatment appear different , instance surgery surgery , experience recruitment difficulty . This potential participant may acquire strong preference one treatments willing accept possibility allocate less non-preferred option alternative . There also problem bias one treatment mention patient option trial introduce ; first mention treatment may perceive preferred doctor patient . This trial design overcome potential difficulty maximise recruitment follow . Colorectal cancer patient present pulmonary metastasis first consent registration study . This consent undergo evaluation accord trial protocol part work consideration MDT . Following evaluation , MDT consider would normally treat patient accord standard local practice . Patients eligible randomisation clinical uncertainty exist whether surgery would benefit . This trial design successful study feasibility randomise patient trial mesothelioma surgery . The time take patient undergo full range test evaluation give time think carefully possible treatment option discuss doctor . In addition patient information leaflet , patient invite take home DVD explain trial detail , watch often patient like . It hop ultimately identify eligible randomisation few anxiety extend opportunity consider trial . Local site research staff involve recruiting patient attend train session learn best method inform patient trial recruitment commences .</detailed_description>
