	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether tight control patient newly diagnose psoriatic arthritis ( consist regular 4 weekly objective assessment disease activity protocol-led intensive treatment ) improve outcome oppose standard care ( usually 3 monthly review objective outcome measure protocol treatment ) . The principle hypothesis study tight control inflammation psoriatic arthritis use treatment protocol pre-defined objective target treatment lead improvement patient ' disease activity reduction radiological joint damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The TICOPA trial design randomise , control , parallel group , open label , multi-centre clinical trial 206 patient recent onset psoriatic arthritis . Patients randomise 1:1 basis receive either standard care ( 12 weekly review ) tight control ( 4 weekly review ) period 48 week . The hypothesis tight control inflammation lead good outcome term joint inflammation , joint damage , pain quality life people PsA . This image undertaken within study provide measure joint inflammation damage improve understanding relationship inflammation , damage bony proliferation psoriatic arthritis . Those subject randomise tight control arm review every 4 week ( PI site designate researcher ) , treat accord rapidly escalate regime , involve standard DMARDs biologics . Initial therapy oral methotrexate , increase dose rapidly first 8 week study . From 12 week visit onwards , escalation therapy arm perform subject meet objective target Minimal Disease Activity . Initial escalation combination DMARD therapy . If patient tight control arm fail meet MDA criterion fulfil NICE criterion use TNF blocker psoriatic arthritis 24 week , offer treatment medication . Therapy continue modify throughout 48 week follow-up state minimal disease activity reach . The control group see every 12 week general rheumatology clinic receive standard care , involve standard DMARDs biologics appropriate . Treatment prescribe felt appropriate treating physician set protocol restriction . All subject treat followed-up 48 week randomisation accord treatment allocation 12 weekly clinical disease assessment throughout period fully train , blind assessor . This include measure disease activity five aspect PsA ( joint disease , skin disease , enthesitis , dactylitis spinal disease ) .</detailed_description>
