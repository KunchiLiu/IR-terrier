	<brief_summary>When patient present thyroid mass , part work-up may include fine needle aspiration biopsy ( FNAB ) . The result biopsy help plan treatment . If result benign , management typically follow nodule . If result demonstrate suspicious cancer , papillary thyroid carcinoma ( PTC ) , treatment total thyroidectomy ( total thyroid removal ) . The late American thyroid association guideline PTC ( 2009 ) suggest many instance central lymph node dissection ( CLND ) perform conjunction total thyroidectomy . This procedure consist remove lymphatic ( glandular ) tissue surround thyroid , tissue may propensity cancer spread . The procedure 's necessity meet much controversy last decade , become standard thyroid cancer surgery . When thyroid nodule FNAB report indeterminate , treatment strategy less clear cut . While diagnostic hemi-thyroidectomy therapeutic total thyroidectomy may order , inclusion CLND clearly define . In many center CLND omit surgical management `` indeterminate '' lesion , others , standard protocol . The argument perform CLND largely base tenet add little surgical time , cost risk patient . Because evidence prognostic role lymph node metastasis limit many would argue risk perform CLND great perform CLND . Furthermore , event find cancer final pathology , thus , re-operate thyroid/central compartment bed , post-operative complication may increase . Opponents CLND argue paucity strong evidence support CLND improvement oncologic outcomes potentially increase post-operative low calcium level vocal nerve damage However , recommendation base retrospective level III evidence . Thus debate continue : CLND justify adjunct hemi-or total thyroidectomy indeterminate thyroid pathology ? The hypothesis : CLND hem- total thyroidectomy `` indeterminate '' thyroid nodule increase post-operative complication .</brief_summary>
