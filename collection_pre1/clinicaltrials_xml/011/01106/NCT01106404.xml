	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , prospective , open-label , randomize , crossover study design gather clinical information subject ' experience use new feature RestoreSensor implantable neurostimulator . Current spinal cord stimulators chronic intractable pain stimulate target nerve along spine use electrical impulse . The stimulation interfere transmission pain signal brain replace painful sensation tingle sensation call paresthesia . Variation intensity neurostimulation body position challenge patient implant conventional spinal cord stimulation system positional change may result overstimulation understimulation . Patients need manually adjust stimulation use patient programmer maintain comfort level position change . The AdaptiveStim feature RestoreSensor neurostimulator develop address challenge improve pain relief and/or convenience relative manual programming adjustment .</detailed_description>
