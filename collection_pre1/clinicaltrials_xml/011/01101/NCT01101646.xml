	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Relative Bioavailability Study With Rabeprazole Sodium Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( patient know treatment/drug take ) , single-dose , 3-way crossover study evaluate compare pharmacokinetics ( blood level ) safety 2 formulation orally ( mouth ) administer rabeprazole sodium healthy volunteer . Rabeprazole sodium drug use treat patient Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) , condition esophagus ( tube throat stomach ) become irritated inflamed acid back stomach . The primary outcome measure study evaluate relative bioavailability ( rate extent drug absorb reach blood circulation ) rabeprazole sodium ( Phase 3 versus Phase 1 formulation ) effect food ( Phase 3 formulation ) estimation standard plasma PK parameter ( Cmax , maximum concentration drug blood observed administration ; tmax , time take drug reach maximum concentration blood administration ; AUC [ area curve ] ) rabeprazole major metabolite.Blood sample assess PK study drug obtain 16 hour dose Day 1 3 treatment period . Thirty-six ( 36 ) healthy volunteer enrol participate study total approximately 36 day ( begin screen end-of-study procedure ) . During study , healthy volunteer make total approximately 4 visit study center . The 4 visit include screen visit three 2-day inpatient stay receive study drug . During screen visit , detail regard study explain volunteer wish participate study , sign informed consent form obtain . After informed consent obtain , study specific entry criterion review volunteer , information regard volunteer 's medical history demographic ( age , race , etc ) collect , follow procedure perform : physical examination , measurement vital sign ( pulse rate blood pressure ) , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , serum pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) , serology , drug screen alcohol test , laboratory testing ( hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) . During treatment period , volunteer fulfill study enty criterion randomize receive 1 3 treatment follow : ( 1 ) strawberry flavor suspension phase 1 formulation study drug fast state ( 2 ) strawberry flavor suspension phase 3 formulation study drug fast state , ( 3 ) strawberry flavor suspension phase 3 formulation study drug feed state ( food ) OR phase 3 formulation study drug sprinkle 1 ounce plain yogurt . During 2-day treatment period , volunteer admit study center overnight fast ( withhold consumption food ) period least 8 hour blood drawn laboratory safety test Day 1 , receive study drug Day 1 , remain overnight study center unit completion Day 2 study procedure . After Day 2 study procedure complete , volunteer discharge study center unit 7- 14-day period return study center 2nd treatment period . The procedure follow treatment period 2 3 . During study , safety monitor measurement vital sign dose treatment period , ECG find screen end-of-study ( Day 2 treatment period 3 time early withdrawal study ) , evaluation adverse event report time screen end study . In 3 treatment period , healthy volunteer receive equivalent 10 mg dose rabeprazole sodium ( ie , four 2.5 mg capsule phase 3 pediatric bead formulation two 5-mg sachet phase 1 pediatric bead formulation ) mix strawberry-flavored vehicle administer orally suspension receive four 2.5 mg capsule phase 3 formulation sprinkle plain yogurt ingest ( eat ) .</detailed_description>
