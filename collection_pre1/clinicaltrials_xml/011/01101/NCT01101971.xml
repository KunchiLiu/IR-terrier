	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate effectiveness web base learn module preparation medical student undertake first female pelvic exam . Background : Bryden Magee ( Meds 2010 ) supervision Robert Reid , M.D. , create educational DVD © 2009 give step-by-step approach pelvic exam utilize real patient video clip illustration . Endorsed Association Professors Obstetrics Gynaecology Canada ( APOG ) , educational innovation show improve knowledge confidence medical student learn skill ( Magee 2009 ) . The video content accessible Queen 's faculty student affiliated School Medicine MEdTech . Methods : We introduce medical student MEdTech pelvic exam module use comprehensive assessment tool , design experienced gynaecologist Department , measure well perform first exam female volunteer act mock patient . We plan recruit 48 student 4 mock patient . Outcome : We evaluate success rate student achieve pass grade 50 % ( 12/24 ) first unassisted speculum bimanual examination view video content .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preparing Medical Students Undertake First Female Pelvic Exam .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At Queen 's University student may many month GTA teach session first attendance gynaecology clinic . In many circumstance preparedness perform first examination seem limited . The first examination experience clinic critical since subsequent examination do critique feedback . We wish determine whether web-based video instruction module , view immediately prior first examination , adequately prepare naïve student skilfully perform first pelvic exam . This require simulate patient , qualified examiner , use comprehensive assessment tool . If technology effective offer significant saving term time medical school schedule many GTAs session many month , student currently set aside two hour GTA session , term ongoing cost ( $ 200 per student GTA session ; $ 20,000 per year ) . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness MEdTech e-learning module design prepare medical student undertake first female pelvic exam . Methods : We introduce first year medical student MEdTech e-learning module . Following exposure measure well perform first exam female volunteer act mock patient use comprehensive 23-item assessment tool design experienced gynaecologist Department . We recruit four woman act simulate patient . We expect 48 student choose participate study . Four resident Department Obstetrics Gynaecology act examiner . We estimate take 20 minute student perform pelvic exam , grade receive feedback resident examiner . Four exam per simulate patient would allow research team test 48 student three session . The study take place Fraser Armstrong Patient Centre Kingston General Hospital requisite examination room examination equipment . The nursing supervisor ( Donna Cooper ) give approval educational research protocol . To troubleshoot logistics run small pilot study four student four simulated patient . This session also serve provide instruction mock patient validate score system . Limitations : Our design incorporate comparison group , would logically third year medical student expose current curriculum incorporate GTAs . The aim noninferiority trial would show web-based educational module inferior current teach standard . Anticipating overall pas rate 80 % use margin indifference 10 % , 253 student would require per group ; 80 % Power ; 5 % alpha level ( Pocock 2003 ) . Recognizing sample size clearly feasible ; elect go non-comparative design . We believe study provide relevant data apply medical education curriculum , possibly result substantial saving time cost .</detailed_description>
