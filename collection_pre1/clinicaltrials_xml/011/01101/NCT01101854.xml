	<brief_summary>This study two arm : 1 ) biopsy arm 2 ) debridement arm . The purpose biopsy arm determine whether similar pattern gene turn and/or turned among people heal non-healing wound . The purpose debridement arm ( ) identify nature bacterial infection gene drive tissue response ; ( ii ) determine biofilm component arrest/paralyze immune function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two arm : 1 ) biopsy arm 2 ) debridement arm . The purpose biopsy arm determine whether similar pattern gene turn and/or turned among people heal non-healing wound . The purpose debridement arm ( ) identify nature bacterial infection gene drive tissue response ; ( ii ) determine biofilm component arrest/paralyze immune function . For biopsy arm , single subject ( current OSU Comprehensive Wound Center patient ) provide 2 tissue sample ( 3 mm punch biopsy sample collect wound care physician ) single wound 4-week time period . The wound sample categorize heal versus non-healing response basis decrease ( heal ) increase ( non-healing ) wound area measurement 4-week time period . A chronic wound generally wind show sign significant heal four week heal eight week . The ability obtain additional measurement patient ' medical record 12 week enrollment study confirm heal non-healing trajectory wound . For debridement arm , single subject ( current OSU Comprehensive Wound Center patient ) see 1 time CWC regularly schedule wound care visit schedule surgery debrided tissue ( foreign matter dead tissue wound ) ordinarily discard collect . No additional wound care visit require study-related visit happen regularly schedule appointment OSU Comprehensive Wound Center operate room ( OR ) ( patient 's physician determines surgical debridement require ) . The ability obtain additional measurement patient ' medical record 12 week enrollment study confirm heal non-healing trajectory wound . Debrided tissue collect divide three part : A ) Necrotic/slough tissue ( N ) ; B ) Live tissue determine consistency pinkish color , perfuse ( LNP ) ; C ) Red perfuse tissue ( LP ) . If difficult clearly distinguish LNP LP , two group combine together . In effort identify infection marker normal impaired healing , plan create database contains pathogen type , gene protein expression profile enzymatic activity infect human wound specimen .</detailed_description>
