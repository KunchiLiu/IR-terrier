	<brief_summary>This study aim compare outcome patient undergo single-port laparoscopic colectomy conventional laparoscopic colectomy colonic neoplasia ( large polyp amenable endoscopic removal/ cancer ) randomize control trial . After informed consent , patient randomize either conventional single-port laparoscopic colectomy team surgeon good experience laparoscopic colorectal surgery . Patients ' demographic , operative detail post-operative outcome include operating time , blood loss , complication , pain score , analgesic requirement , resumption gastrointestinal function length hospital stay record prospectively . The patient blind type treatment receive first three day operation ( post-operative pain analgesic requirement record period ) . Patients long term record cancer recurrence survival . The result two group patient compare scientifically assess single-incision laparoscopic colectomy result difference outcomes compare conventional laparoscopic colectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Single Port Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Colectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventionally laparoscopic surgery require multiple abdominal wall incision placement port laparoscopic instrument perform operation . With advancement technology , laparoscopic surgery perform one special port accommodate several laparoscopic instrument perform operation hence , require one small 2-3cm incision umbilicus . This commonly name Single-incision Laparoscopic Surgery ( SILS ) single-port laparoscopic surgery . Compared conventional laparoscopic surgery , SILS advantage reduction post-operative wound pain one small abdominal incision require . The cosmetic result SILS also good incision make umbilicus hide wind effectively operation . After complete heal umbilical wound , patient 's abdomen could visually 'scarless ' . There study compare result new single-port laparoscopic colectomy conventional laparoscopic colectomy literature yet . In order decide new technique recommend patient treatment colonic neoplasia , formal study require . We design patient blind randomize control trial investigate difference two laparoscopic colectomies . The primary outcome measure post-operative pain cough analgesia consumption . The patient blind type treatment receive first three day operation . During three day , post-operative pain score analgesic requirement record independently Pain team also blind type procedure . The secondary measure include operate time , blood loss , morbidity mortality , cancer recurrence patient survival long term . The secondary outcome also record prospectively compare . Definition conversion : Conversion conventional define need place additional port aid procedure single port laparoscopic colectomy Conversion open define ( 1 ) need perform conventional laparotomy order accomplish procedure ( 2 ) premature abdominal incision colorectal dissection vascular control single port conventional laparoscopic colectomy .</detailed_description>
