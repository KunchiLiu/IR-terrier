	<brief_summary>This study look whether Metformin , agent commonly use treat diabetes , decrease affect ability breast cancer cell grow whether Metformin work therapy keep cancer recur . Health Canada approve sale use Metformin treat breast cancer , although approve use clinical trial . Although Metformin approve FDA treatment diabetes , use breast cancer consider investigational .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Randomized Trial Metformin v Placebo Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare invasive disease-free survival patient hormone receptor positive early-stage breast cancer treat metformin v placebo addition standard adjuvant therapy . Secondary - To compare overall survival patient . - To compare distant disease-free survival patient . - To compare breast cancer-free interval patient . - To compare change body mass index patient . - To compare adverse event patient . - To compare medical endpoint , include new diagnosis diabetes mellitus cardiovascular hospitalization ( include emergency room visit overnight stay ) death ( stroke myocardial infarction ) , patient . - To compare health-related quality life measure use EORTC QLQ-C30 ( supplement trial-specific checklist ) , Block Alive Screener , physical activity item Nurses Health Study Questionnaire II subset patient . - To compare embedded correlative science outcome include plasma insulin molecular marker metformin action patient . - To compare metabolic parameter include metabolic component insulin resistance syndrome define ATP III criterion subset patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord hormone-receptor status ( estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor- positive v receptor negative ) , body mass index ( ≤ 30 v &gt; 30 kg/m² ) , HER2 status ( positive v negative ) , prior chemotherapy ( v none ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral metformin hydrochloride twice daily ( daily week 1-4 ) . Treatment continue 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily ( daily week 1-4 ) . Treatment continue 5 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor sample collect periodically correlative study . Patients may complete quality-of-life , physical activity , diet questionnaire baseline 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month . ( Sub-set patient ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligibility Criteria : Subjects must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer enrol trial within 12 month first histologic diagnosis invasive breast cancer . A core biopsy interpret invasive cancer meet criterion ; otherwise , date first histologic diagnosis date first surgical procedure identifies invasive cancer ( biopsy , lumpectomy mastectomy ) . Neoadjuvant subject evidence clinical T4 disease prior chemotherapy surgery . Bilateral breast carcinoma allow provided diagnosis synchronous , within 3 month one another least one two breast carcinoma meet eligibility criterion neither violates eligibility criterion . All subject ( adjuvant neoadjuvant ) must sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary lymph node dissection . Sentinel lymph node biopsy alone allow following instance : 1. sentinel lymph node biopsy negative : pN0 2. sentinel lymph node biopsy positive isolate tumour cell : pN0 ( i+ ) 3 . * clinically node negative , T12 tumours sentinel lymph node biopsy positive ≤ 2 lymph node without extracapsular extension mat node undergo breast conserving surgery tangential whole breast irradiation ( * excludes subject treat neoadjuvant systemic therapy ) Definitive surgery and/or chemotherapy complete least 4 week prior randomization . Surgical margin must clear invasive carcinoma . If microscopic residual ductal situ disease present lumpectomy total mastectomy margin , excision highly recommend . If excision undertaken , subject may still enter study , provide addition breast chest wall irradiation , boost tumour bed deliver . In situ lobular disease margin acceptable . Adjuvant subject follow pT pN combination eligible : pT1c , pN0 AND negative estrogen progesterone receptor AND HER2 negative OR pT2N0 least one follow tumour characteristic : histologic grade 3 , lymphovascular invasion , negative estrogen progesterone receptor , HER2 positive , Oncotype Dx recurrence score ≥ 25 ( Oncotype Dx recurrence score available , Ki67 &gt; 14 % ) OR Subjects pT3 , pN0 OR Subjects pT13 , pN13 The eligibility neoadjuvant subject assess basis cTNM . The eligible TNM combination apply . HER2 status must know . ( Positive = 3+ overexpression IHC &gt; 30 % invasive tumour cell OR HER2 gene amplification FISH/CISH &gt; 6 HER2 gene copy per nucleus , OR FISH/CISH ratio : HER2 gene copy chromosome 17 signal ≥ 2.2 . All result consider negative ) . Patients must bilateral mammogram within 12 month prior randomization , unless initial surgery total mastectomy , case mammogram remain breast require . ( Subjects bilateral total mastectomy mammogram within 12 month prior randomization must , instead , physical examination chest wall ensure residual recurrent disease time randomization . The date examination use place mammogram date eligibility checklist . ) Investigations , include chest Xray CT chest , bone scan ( radiographs suspicious area ) abdominal ultrasound liver scan CT abdomen perform first histologic diagnosis time randomization . Chest XRay , 2 view ( Chest CT ) mandatory Bone scan ( xrays abnormal area ) require sign symptom metastatic disease Abdominal imaging require sign symptom metastatic disease Hematology investigation ( WBC , Granulocytes , Platelets , Hemoglobin ) complete within 28 day prior randomization result available . Biochemistry investigation complete within 28 day prior randomization value within parameter require protocol .

Age &gt; 80 carry increase risk lactic acidosis study intervention 5 year ) . Subjects must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must assure subject randomize trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 10 work day patient randomization . Subject consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Because differ requirement , standard consent form trial provide sample form give . A copy initial full board REB approval approve consent form must send central office . The patient must sign consent form prior randomization registration . Please note consent form study must contain statement give permission NCIC CTG monitoring agency review patient record ( see Section 16 detail ) . For first 888 eligible English Frenchspeaking subject ( subset enrollment complete 2011NOV04 ) : Subject able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete Quality Life ( EORTC QLQ C30 Trial Specific Checklist ) English French . The baseline assessment must already complete time enrollment . Inability ( illiteracy English French , loss sight equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study ; however , ability unwillingness complete questionnaire make patient ineligible . ( Once target number 888 subject achieve , criterion longer need fulfil . ) [ See Appendix VI ] . Subset enrollment complete 2011NOV04 . Englishspeaking subject complete Quality Life Questionnaire able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete Nurses Health Study II Physical Activity Questionnaire Block Alive Screener English .

Ineligibility Criteria : Subjects history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . Subjects locally recurrent metastatic breast carcinoma . ( Subjects prior invasive breast cancer time eligible . Subjects prior DCIS either breast eligible provide DCIS curatively treat include surgery , radiotherapy and/or Tamoxifen ) . Subjects whose axillary node status unknown .

Any condition associate increase risk metforminassociated lactic acidosis ( e.g . congestive heart failure define New York Heart Association { NYHA } Class III IV functional status [ see Appendix IX ] , history acidosis type ; habitual * Currently take metformin , sulfonylurea , thiazolidinediones insulin reason .
