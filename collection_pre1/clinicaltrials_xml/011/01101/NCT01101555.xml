	<brief_title>Repeat Dose Subcutaneous Rhumatoid Arthritis Efficacy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Otelixizumab humanize , aglycosyl , non-mitogenic , anti CD3 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) direct ε domain human lymphocyte antigen CD3 , currently undergo phase III clinical trial adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patient evaluate rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis patient small exploratory study . Otelixizumab administered via subcutaneous route single dose type I diabetes patient . This study randomise , single-blind , placebo-controlled , repeat dose study otelixizumab administer subcutaneously rheumatoid arthritis patient . One cohort receive single dose adalimumab ( HUMIRA , Abbott ) rescue medication ass additional concomitant safety tolerability issue . This study consist screen phase , follow in-house phase whereby otelixizumab administer cohort stagger fashion . Six cumulative dos evaluate cover 10-fold dose range seven cohort . The start regimen three dos ( 1.5 mg cumulative dose ) , increase 15 dos ( 15 mg cumulative dose ) . Cohorts 1a 1b include optional low dos . Serial blood sample obtain clinical laboratory testing , determination pharmacodynamic marker , serum otelixizumab PK parameter , immunogenicity . Safety pharmacodynamic data previous dose ( ) evaluate prior dose escalation modification ensure safety achieve target systemic peripheral blood pharmacology . Adverse event , laboratory value , vital sign ECG 's monitor closely study . All subject study undergo long-term follow-up 48 month monitor ensure patient safety .</detailed_description>
