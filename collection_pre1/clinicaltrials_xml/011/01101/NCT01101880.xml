	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give clofarabine cytarabine together filgrastim work treat patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , advance myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , and/or advanced myeloproliferative neoplasm . Drugs use chemotherapy , clofarabine cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving drug different dos may kill cancer cell . Colony stimulate factor , filgrastim , may increase number immune cell find bone marrow peripheral blood may help immune system recover side effect chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess complete remission ( CR ) rate regimen compare 7 + 3 standard induction 90 mg/m^2/dose daunorubicin ( historical control ) previously untreated patient AML advance MDS advance myeloproliferative neoplasm less age 65 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine event free survival ( EFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) treatment related mortality regimen . II . To assess toxicity regimen previously untreated patient . III . To determine whether 3 consolidation chemotherapy cycle consist G-CSF ( filgrastim ) , clofarabine , cytarabine ( GCLAC ) administer prompt recovery blood count . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin day prior chemotherapy continue blood count recover . Patients receive clofarabine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour follow cytarabine IV 2 hour daily 5 day . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive filgrastim SC daily 5 day begin day prior chemotherapy . Patients receive clofarabine IV 1 hour follow cytarabine IV 2 hour daily 4 day . Treatment induction therapy may continue 2 course treatment consolidation therapy may continue 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
