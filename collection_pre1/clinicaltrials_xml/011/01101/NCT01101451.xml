	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy chemotherapy see well work compare radiation therapy alone treat patient stage I stage II cervical cancer previously underwent surgery . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether give radiation therapy together chemotherapy effective radiation therapy alone treat patient cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Chemotherapy Patients With Stage I Stage II Cervical Cancer Who Previously Underwent Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine post-operative adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy ( CRT ) significantly improve recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) compare radiation therapy ( RT ) alone stage I-IIA cervical cancer patient intermediate-risk factor treatment radical hysterectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether post-operative adjuvant CRT improve overall survival ( OS ) compare RT alone stage I-IIA cervical cancer patient intermediate risk factor treatment radical hysterectomy . II . To assess difference ( across treatment arm ) incidence severity therapy-attributed adverse event utilize active version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . III . To provide assessment patient risk v benefit ( positive study ) . IV . To determine whether post-operative adjuvant CRT improve health-related quality-of-life ( QOL ) ( compare RT alone ) measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cervix ( FACT-Cx ) Trial Outcome Index ( TOI ) produce favorable toxicity profile ( particular focus treatment related genitourinary , gastrointestinal , neurological , pain sexual adverse event ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To bank archival tumor tissue research study , include study evaluate association biomarkers , RFS , OS , clinical-surgical-pathologic characteristic patient randomize post-operative adjuvant CRT compare RT alone . II . To bank deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) whole blood research study , include study evaluate association single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , measure clinical outcome , include RFS , OS , adverse event patient randomize post-operative adjuvant CRT compare RT alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo pelvic external-beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week 5.5 week . ARM II : Patients receive cisplatin IV 1-2 hour day 1 undergo radiotherapy Arm I . Treatment cisplatin repeat every 7 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
