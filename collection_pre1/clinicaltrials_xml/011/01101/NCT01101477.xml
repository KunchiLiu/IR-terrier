	<brief_summary>Flexible bronchoscopy ( FB ) sedation require keep sedative level narrow window prevent sedation . Sedative drug titration accord subjective adjustment individual physician may cause unsteady drug concentration . Target controlled infusion ( TCI ) provide precise pharmacokinetic control propofol , direct control effect side , ( eg . Brain ) concentration ( Ce ) , applied surgical anesthesia variable procedure sedation . We design pilot study evaluate optimal regimen TCI FB sedation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Propofol ideal bronchoscopy sedation fast onset quick recovery effect . Our research report different investigator demonstrate patient receive propofol sedation recover fast excellent satisfaction bronchoscopy . However , amount propofol induction maintenance calculate simply patient 's body weight physician ' experience . For non-anesthesiologists , perform sedative work outside operating room , inexperienced anesthesiologist without fully consider individual pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic difference may generate unstable drug plasma concentration increase cardio-respiration suppression . Therefore , manner assess measure objectively individual pharmacokinetic difference may improve sedative quality decrease complication rate . A model call `` Target-controlled infusion '' ( TCI ) , build massive pharmacokinetic sample propofol , could give precise pharmacokinetic control . Several pharmacokinetic model built-in TCI , include Schnider model use concentration effect site ( Ce , propofol concentration brain ) sedative guide . The model integrate individual variant age , height , weight gender calculate infusion profile achieve predetermine steady `` target effect site concentration '' ( Cet ) . Because unique consideration individual pharmacokinetic variant Ce targeting , TCI provide predictable sedative level suitable procedure require narrow therapeutic level . Beside general anesthesia , TCI apply breast biopsy , upper gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasound endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography outpatient clinic . According evidence , potential role TCI bronchoscopic sedation . Based current evidence experience , design study evaluate optimal regimen induction procedure bronchoscopy . We hope study could provide safety efficient bronchoscopic sedation patient physician .</detailed_description>
