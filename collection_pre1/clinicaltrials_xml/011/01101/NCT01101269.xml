	<brief_title>Effect Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor , Lisinopril , Renal Blood Flow Its Correlation With Proteinuria Reduction Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blockers renin angiotensin aldosterone system ( RAAS ) consider standard care treatment diabetic nephropathy . Their effect think multiple mechanism , include reduce intraglomerular pressure . However , due lack sensitive , practical noninvasive method monitor renal hemodynamics , magnitude hemodynamic effect agent contribution proteinuria reduction study human . At time , clear treatment blocker RAAS similar renal hemodynamic effect individual without diabetes kidney disease . Up 36 subject type 2 diabetes 150 mg proteinuria stable dos ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) 18 healthy volunteer enrol study . Subjects type 2 diabetes ask stop ACE inhibitor ARB medication 10 day . Between 7 10 day stop medication renal blood flow ( RBF ) measure use contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEU ) urine protein measure well comparison baseline . Subjects ' ACE inhibitor ARB restart RBF measurement use CEU measurement urine protein excretion repeat 7 day . For comparison , RBF measure CEU 18 healthy volunteer . They start Lisinopril 10 mg orally day 7 day . On day 7 RBF measurement repeat assess effect ACE inhibitor RBF healthy individual compare diabetic nephropathy .</detailed_description>
