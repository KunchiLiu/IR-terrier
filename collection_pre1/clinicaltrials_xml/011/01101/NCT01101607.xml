	<brief_summary>Distal forearm fracture amongst frequently encounter orthopedic injury pediatric emergency department ( ED ) . Immediate close manipulation cast immobilization , still mainstay management . The initial management non-displaced minimally displaced extremity fracture relocation uncomplicated joint dislocation part usual practice emergency medicine . Although focused train fracture-dislocation reduction technique part core curriculum emergency medicine training program , limited data discuss outcome follow restorative fracture care pediatric emergency medicine ( PEM ) physicians . The primary objective study compare length-of-stay clinical outcome close manipulation uncomplicated , isolated , distal forearm fracture , PEMs manipulation pediatric orthopedic surgeon . Our hypothesis difference emergency department length-of-stay fracture reduction perform PEM versus post graduate year 3 4 orthopedic resident . Secondary outcome assess include : loss reduction need re-manipulation follow , cast related complication , radiographic functional heal 6-8 week post injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pediatric forearm fracture common injury frequent cause emergency room admission . Ward et al outline demand emergency department coverage place practice orthopedic surgeon . Assuming statistically significant difference outcomes , potential advantage PEMs provide restorative fracture care initial visit . This practice would permit judicious orthopedic consultation time several emergency department 's face `` call '' specialist coverage crisis exist nationwide shortage fellowship train pediatric orthopedic specialist , addition ACGME mandate duty hour restriction orthopedic resident . Pershad et al conduct retrospective study historical control , 60 patient distal radius fracture reduce orthopedic resident PEM physician . In review , difference rate re-intervention restore fracture alignment ED length-of-stay two groups.Mean facility charge low group treat PEMs . It hypothesis goal direct training , PEM physicians perform closed reduction uncomplicated distal forearm fracture outcomes similar fracture reduction perform senior orthopedic resident physician .</detailed_description>
