	<brief_title>Does Positive Expiratory Pressure Mask Therapy Improve Recovery From Acute Exacerbations Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim identify whether addition positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) mask therapy standard medical care improve symptom , quality life risk re-exacerbation individual acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . A PEP mask small hand-held device self-applied nose mouth . It create resistance exhalation ( outward ) breath help facilitate movement sputum lung towards mouth . Participants recruit two tertiary metropolitan hospital Melbourne , Australia randomise receive either 'usual care ' ( comprise medical management , non-invasive ventilation require , rehabilitation ally health intervention ) 'usual care ' plus PEP mask therapy duration hospital admission . All participant complete daily diary six month discharge . The effect PEP mask therapy evaluate use range outcome important patient health care provider .</detailed_description>
