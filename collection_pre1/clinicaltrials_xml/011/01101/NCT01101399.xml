	<brief_summary>Anaemia functional iron deficiency common condition patient lymphoid malignancy , condition reduce significantly quality life increase morbidity mortality . Traditionally , Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents ( ESAs ) use , recently use show negative impact overall survival different oncology population . Recently publish data suggest intravenous ( IV ) iron effective anaemia treatment , even without ESAs . This exploratory study first clinical project ferric carboxymaltose ( FCM ) patient lymphoid malignancy : data generate may use evaluation drug large population . In study , 1,000 mg IV iron FCM administer day within 24 hour chemotherapy treatment . The primary objective evaluate efficacy FCM correction haemoglobin level anaemic subject lymphoid malignancy , undergo chemotherapy . Secondary objective aim describe safety tolerability FCM , effect FCM treatment iron status variable subject suffer lymphoid malignancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ferric Carboxymaltose Subjects With Functional Iron Deficiency Undergoing Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicentre , randomise , control , 2-arm open-label prospective pilot study evaluate efficacy safety FCM treatment anaemia LPD subject functional iron deficiency ( FID ) , undergo chemotherapy . The subject screen eligibility within 4 week prior inclusion receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion FCM FCM infusion ( subject may treat accord local institutional practice require symptomatic management anaemia ) . After randomisation , visit schedule weekly Week 8 .</detailed_description>
