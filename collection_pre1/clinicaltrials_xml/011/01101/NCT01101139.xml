	<brief_title>Sugammadex Improves Muscle Function After Standard Neuromuscular Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle relaxant integral part today 's anesthesia . They improve intubate condition reduce dos substance need general anesthesia . For ensure patient safety , neuromuscular function monitor general anesthesia . The latter one terminate , neuromuscular monitoring show objective normal value . Despite accurate surveillance , lot patient complain subjectively uncomfortable muscle weakness recovery room . A possible explanation ostensive contradiction variable `` margin safety '' neuromuscluar transmission different muscle group . Waud et al describe phenomenon , fact , neuromuscular transmission clinically detectable , certain number post-synaptic receptor block . The necessary fraction free receptor differs lot muscle group ( 15-50 % ) . As neuromuscular monitoring measure one muscle group exemplarily , clinically non-detectable number post-synaptic receptor block shortly anesthesia , subjective muscle weakness patient could need treatment . Sugammadex encapsulate steroid-typ muscle relaxant within 2 5 minute . After apply sufficiently high dose , also receptor free elude neuromuscular monitoring . This constellation bring interest problem quantify possible effect patient ' subjective muscle weakness . This study design investigate , application sugammadex improve muscle function consequently well-being patient , extubated accord clinical standard .</detailed_description>
