	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether subject gout receive febuxostat allopurinol 9 year higher rate serious heart blood vessel complication ( major cardiovascular event ) . Examples major cardiovascular event include heart attack , stroke , angina ( chest pain due narrow blood vessel heart ) need treat urgently heart operation . The overall duration study dependent number predefined major cardiovascular event ( MACE ) . The length study expect approximately 9 year order observe require 624 MACE . The length study participation subject vary due event driven study design . The purpose study see subject gout receive febuxostat allopurinol , daily ( QD ) , high rate serious heart blood vessel complication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase 3B multicenter , randomize , double-blind , active-controlled study design evaluate cardiovascular ( CV ) safety febuxostat compare allopurinol subject gout significant CV comorbidities . Approximately 7500 subject , males 50 year age old females 55 year age old ( least 2-years post-menopausal ) , gout health problem affect heart blood vessel take part study approximately 450 study center North America . This study use competitive enrollment . This mean target number subject enter treatment phase study , screen subject close . The length study base ongoing review study result . The participation last maximum 9 year include maximum 28 visit study center . Telephone contact make every 2 month subject discontinue study drug reason , ask continue study follow potential cardiovascular event . This study design call `` Time Event Study '' . All study subject continue follow enough information gather determine overall safety study drug . Gout cause high level uric acid body , associate broad range condition include heart disease , chronic kidney disease additional risk factor like obesity high blood pressure . Hyperuricemia , define elevation serum urate level , develop gout urate crystal form supersaturated body fluid settle joint organ . People gout may also high incidence condition may associate hyperuricemia , gout . This support grow body research demonstrate serum urate level independent predictive factor cardiovascular disease effect risk factor control . This study explore cardiovascular safety febuxostat determine whether use febuxostat associate moderate increase risk serious adverse cardiovascular outcome compare allopurinol . Participation last maximum 5 year include 15 20 visit study center .</detailed_description>
