	<brief_title>Comparison Sevikar® Combination Perindopril/Amlodipine Central Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study , multi-center balance , parallel group ( two treatment arm ) , randomize , double-blind ( double-dummy ) , non-inferiority study design show non-inferiority Sevikar® ( olmesartan ( OM ) /amlodipine ( AM ) ) 40/10 mg compare combination Perindopril ( PER ) 8 mg plus Amlodipine 10 mg regard central systolic blood pressure lower effect , use change baseline ( Week 0 ) final examination ( Week 24 ) . Male female Caucasians age ≥ 40 year &lt; 80 year moderate severe hypertension , define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 160 ≤ 200 diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 100 ≤ 115 mmHg untreated patient , SBP ≥ 140 DBP ≥ 90 mmHg insufficiently pre-treated patient SBP ≥ 130 mmHg DBP ≥ 80 mmHg insufficiently pretreated diabetic chronic kidney disease eligible participation . In addition , three additional risk factor present . During course study three central blood pressure measurement ( randomization , week 12 termination ) perform SphygmoCor ultrasound method . The conventional measurement calibrate tensiometer ( Omron ) perform visit . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring perform randomisation . The study start 2-4 week run phase . AM give open-labelled 5 mg 10 mg tablet , administer daily . After randomization double-blind phase , study medication comprise either OM/AM 40/10 mg PER 8 mg ( 2x4 mg ) plus AM 10 mg administer daily . Furthermore , open-label HCTZ 12.5 mg 25.0 mg provide tablet administer daily accord treatment schedule . The primary endpoint change central SBP baseline ( Week 0 , Visit 0 ) final examination ( Week 24 , Visit 5 ) use Last Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF ) approach . The study conduct approximately 15 centre Spain . Depending previously administer drug run phase four week ( Visits -2 -1 ) . Individual duration active treatment ( randomization ) last 24 week ( Visits 0-5 ) . The total individual duration 28 week . A total 518 patient ( 259 patients/arm ) need Per Protocol Set ( PPS ) confirmatory primary analysis use mean change baseline ( Week 0 ) Final Examination assume drop rate 20 % Run-in Phase total 720 patient screen order achieve 576 ( 288 patients/arm ) randomise patient . Assuming approximately 10 % major protocol deviation , total 518 patient remain PPS .</detailed_description>
