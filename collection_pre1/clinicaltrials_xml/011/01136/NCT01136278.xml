	<brief_summary>The purpose study determinate effect pre-treatment centrally act alpha2-receptor agonist clonidine pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` Ecstasy '' ) . The investigator hypothesize clonidine attenuate subjective cardiovascular response MDMA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacological Interaction Between Clonidine Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) widely use young people euphoric effect . MDMA release serotonin ( 5-HT ) , norepinephrine ( NE ) , dopamine . It unknown monoamine mainly contribute subjective physiological effect MDMA human . Clonidine centrally act alpha2-receptor agonist sympatholytic attenuates release NE presynaptic nerve terminal also lower NE plasma concentration . To determine role NE response MDMA humans test effect clonidine pretreatment pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics MDMA . We use randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design four experimental session . Clonidine ( 150 Î¼g ) placebo administer 1 h administration MDMA ( 125 mg ) placebo 16 healthy volunteer . Subjective cardiovascular response repeatedly assess throughout experiment plasma sample collect pharmacokinetics . We hypothesize clonidine significantly attenuate predominantly cardiovascular response MDMA .</detailed_description>
