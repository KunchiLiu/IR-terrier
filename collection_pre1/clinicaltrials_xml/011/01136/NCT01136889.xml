	<brief_summary>1 . To determine feasibility conduct randomise control trial ( RCT ) effectiveness PFMT intervention conjunction vaginal pessary management versus vaginal pessary management alone woman pelvic organ prolapse . 2 . To develop test method main trial . The ultimate aim large multi-centre RCT would answer question : Is conservative management pelvic organ prolapse individualise PFMT intervention conjunction vaginal pessary effective vaginal pessary alone reduce prolapse-specific symptom , prolapse severity need prolapse treatment ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It hypothesise undertake PFMT pessary place may increase level exist muscle support pelvic area : reducing descent pelvic organ consequent stretch soft tissue pessary may allow pelvic floor muscle exercise strengthen effectively . Potentially could lead additional improvement pessary retention rate associate prolapse symptom beyond expect pessary alone . Urine , bowel sexual function , affect prolapse , may also improve independently response PFMT intervention . If permanent reduction prolapse symptom result concurrent use PFMT , may delay prevent need long term pessary use surgical intervention . In summary , PFMT intervention combination pessary management vaginal prolapse may effective reduce symptom increase quality life management prolapse pessary alone . This study start provide evidence address question . This feasibility study develop method multi-centre RCT . It run alongside The POPPY Trial ( 17 centre trial PFMT already underway UK ; ClinicalTrials Number NCT00476892 ) . Three The POPPY Trial centre involve feasibility study . Over 12 month period , plan enrol 50 woman diagnose prolapse stage I IV , eligible The POPPY Trial require pessary . These woman randomise one two group : PFMT ( deliver physiotherapist 5 appointment 16 week ) conjunction pessary management prolapse pessary management alone . All woman nurse appointment six month randomisation time pessary remove . A replacement pessary immediately re-fitted . At seven month randomisation woman review appointment gynaecologist prolapse assess , pessary re-fitted necessary , treatment need discuss . Women complete postal questionnaire , baseline ( prior randomisation ) , six month post-randomisation ( prior see nurse pessary remove ) , seven month post-randomisation ( prior 7 month gynaecologist review appointment ) , record symptom diary one month removal pessary . Key outcome : prolapse symptom , prolapse-related quality life , prolapse severity , additional prolapse treatment receive seven month study entry .</detailed_description>
