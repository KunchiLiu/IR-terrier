	<brief_summary>The investigator develop research platform capable improve child 's health generation knowledge analysis routinely collect data within outside health service . The investigator use data routinely collect Wales answer specific question child health well-being , aim informing policy practice Wales , whilst also internationally relevant . Routinely collected datasets publicly fund , already incorporate Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank . The investigator combine datasets child health social care establish anonymised Wales wide Electronic Cohort Children ( WECC ) . WECC serve platform future work translate information child population health policy . There 35,000 birth Wales per year , data available previous ten year . Thus , WECC sufficiently power answer important social , economic health policy question . WECC also act demonstration project would inform development e-cohorts support translational research across life course disease spectrum .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Wales Electronic Cohort Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lack access enormous amount information collect child 's health status treatment major contributor gap translational pathway improve child health individual population level . The creation Wales Electronic Child Cohort design remove block support explanatory interventional study . This proposal consider best way address issue build upon previous strategic investment WORD thus achieve goal cost effective manner . This type E-Cohort 35,000 additional child every year answer question exposure , outcomes potential confounders routinely collect available individual ecological linkage . This retrospective prospective cohort , however , cohort nest case-control study support . Developments geographical information system ( GIS ) , network analysis creation system anonymising household mean possible anonymously link environmentally derive data health data . The huge number individual involve WECC mean study enormous power answer important social , economic health policy question . Examples research question answer : 1 . What factor determine future health service need individual vulnerable birth , inform development intervention reduce health inequality group ? 2 . What influence social physical environment childhood obesity ? 3 . What impact health condition childhood educational outcome child ? 4 . Are birth anomaly common household member receive antibiotic early pregnancy ( marker infectious cause ) ? 5 . What relationship maternal depression , family composition childhood injury risk ? 6 . Can perinatal environmental biological parameter use predict common illness asthma later childhood adult ? 7 . To extent E-Cohorts replicate finding traditional cohort ( e.g . Millennium Cohort Study ) replace need non-routine data collection ? In first instance focus answer first two question .</detailed_description>
