	<brief_summary>The aim trial ass safety , tolerability immunogenicity two dos RUTI® vaccine administer four week apart one month pre-treatment INH . The trial double-blinded , randomize placebo-controlled 96 subject ( 48 HIV- 48 HIV+ subject ) . Three different RUTI® dose placebo test , randomize assign HIV+ HIV- subject . Each subject randomize receive one four treatment ( placebo , 5 , 25 , 50 μg ) , completion one month INH pre-treatment ( one tablet 300mg/day , vp.o. ) . Each subject receive two administration treatment , 28 day apart . Subjects monitor one month second inoculation RUTI® .</brief_summary>
