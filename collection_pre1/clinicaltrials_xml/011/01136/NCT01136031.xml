	<detailed_description>In gastric cancer , several active chemotherapeutic agent introduce . Fluoropyrimidine , platinum , taxane topoisomerase inhibitor commonly use agent . Many available single combination regimen exist . But , standard palliative chemotherapy regimen first line treatment unresectable advanced gastric cancer . Thereafter also standard second line regimen . Usually combination fluoropyrimidine platinum use first line chemotherapy ( example , 5-FU+cisplatin , capecitabine+cisplatin , S-1+ cisplatin , 5-FU+oxaliplatin ) . After failure combination , taxane-based regimen irinotecan-based regimen usually use . But , second-line regimen , combination topoisomerase inhibitor taxane fully evaluate . In study use docetaxel irinotecan combination gastric cancer , toxicity highly concern . ( Jatoi A et al . 2002 , Lordick F etl al . 2003 , S Enrech et al . 2003 , Chang HM et al . 2003 ) The combination paclitaxel irinotecan gastric cancer evaluate two study far know ( K Kobayashi et al . 2006 , Hecht JR et al . 2003 ) . These phase I/II design use combination first second line treatment gastric cancer . The response rate 29.6 % 27 % respectively . In one study , grade 3,4 hematologic toxicity 33.3 % . The dose schedule different two study . In one study , paclitaxel 50mg/m2 irinotecan 50mg/m2 use day 1and day 8 every 3 week . In study , paclitaxel 100mg/m2 irinotecan 225mg/m2 use every 3 week . In study , state UGT1A1 polymorphism enrol patient report . Recently well know UGT1A1 polymorphism influence toxicity profile irinotecan , e , g . myelosuppression diarrhea . If patient UGT1A1*28 ( 7/7 homozygosity ) include low level phase I period , MTD irinotecan might set low dose without show sufficient efficacy . We think may deserve evaluate efficacy paclitaxel irinotecan combination regimen gastric cancer patient necessary conduct phase I study find accurate MTD regimen consider UGT1A1 polymorphism patient . So designed phase I/II study evaluate efficacy toxicity second-line chemotherapy paclitaxel irinotecan fluoropyrimidine platinum-pretreated advanced gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
