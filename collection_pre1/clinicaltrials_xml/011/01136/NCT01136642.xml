	<brief_summary>Background : - Smoking lead cause preventable death United States , researcher interest gain well understand perceived beneficial effect nicotine help improve treatment strategy nicotine dependence . Understanding condition nicotine improve attention cognitive processing may provide useful information research . - The ability pay attention filter relevant irrelevant stimuli central aspect information-processing . Top-down bottom-up attentional process illustrate brain combine stimuli goal-directed behavior . Bottom-up process unconscious response sensory input ; instance , eye automatically focus prominent image picture . Top-down process conscious response drive attention toward specific stimulus ; instance , person ask focus less immediately noticeable image picture . Researchers interested determine whether nicotine improves cognitive performance act top-down bottom-up attentional mechanism . Objectives : - To investigate effect nicotine top-down bottom-up mechanism attention cigarette smoker . Eligibility : - Current smoker ( least 10 cigarette per day least 1 year ) 18 55 year age . Design : - This study involve one training session four experimental session . - During training session , participant receive sample dose nicotine nasal spray use study determine tolerate effect . - For experimental session , participant receive one dose nicotine nasal spray ( 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg ) placebo spray , follow blood pressure heart rate monitoring , performance attentional test , questionnaires rate participant perception nicotine effectiveness . Participants may receive different dos different session , tell dose receive give point .</brief_summary>
