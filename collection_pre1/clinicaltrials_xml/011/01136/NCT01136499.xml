	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Assessment Oral LBH589 Adult Patients With Advanced Soft TIssue Sarcoma After Pre-treatment Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite surgical excision radiation therapy , approximately 50 % patient treat localised STS experience local distant relapse . Recurrent STS : current therapeutic strategy Although patient may salvage surgery , chemotherapy use doxorubicin-based regimen case indicate patient recurrent STS . Progression-free survival ( PFS ) case less equal 6 month . Most patient die disease within 12-15 month follow diagnosis advance disease . Doxorubicin consider standard care first line set patient locally advance unresectable metastatic STS . However , 15-25 % patient exhibit objective response follow chemotherapy 30-35 % experiment rapid disease progression . Doxorubicin-based combination result inconsistent increase response rate survival advantage versus single-agent doxorubicin . After doxorubicin-based regimen failure , agent , include agent approve treatment STS dacarbazine , ifosfamide trabectedin , show low response rate short PFS . The approved agent set trabectedin , show prolonged stabilization approximately 20 % patient 6 month several phase II trial . Gemcitabine-docetaxel combination , although approve treatment STS show interesting response rate leiomyosarcomas , well STS subtypes . Mechanisms chemoresistance poorly understood . Place LBH589 : LBH589 postulate activity sarcoma able arrest gene transcription inhibition HDAC , cause misfolding important protein sarcoma biology fusion protein overexpressed gene ( HDM2 , cdk4 , AKT… ) via disruption HSP90 functioning . Some mechanisms similar leukemia-associated fusion protein , show recruit HDAC repress hematopoietic differentiation , might involve translocation-associated sarcoma . The SYT portion synovial sarcoma oncoprotein SYT-SSX interacts trithorax-group protein bind directly mSin3A HDAC component . SSX associate polycomb-group protein , involve HDAC activity mediate transcriptional repression ; thus , aberrant epigenetic change gene expression seem central effect fusion oncoprotein disease . HDAC inhibitor effective synovial sarcoma Ewing sarcoma preclinical study . Evidence also present growth inhibition induction differentiation clear cell sarcoma ( Nielsen TO , Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute , Vancouver , Canada , unpublished data ) chondrosarcoma HDACi . Data phase I study involve patient advance solid tumor indicate MWF every week schedule LBH589 pharmacodynamically clinically active . Histone acetylation detect peripheral blood cell 72 hour ( maximum duration dos MWF every week schedule ) 50 % patient 20 mg 30 mg dos CR PR observe two three patient respectively , cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Grade 3 fatigue dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) 2 patient treat 40 mg level 1 patient treat 60 mg level . The 40 mg level seem tolerable felt likely activity solid tumor . After first-line chemotherapy failure , efficacy therapeutic alternative limit . The purpose trial therefore investigate efficacy , safety tolerability 40 mg LBH589 give orally twice week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Age ≥ 18 year . Histologically proven advanced metastatic unresectable soft tissue sarcoma , exclude osteosarcoma . Prior treatment doxorubicin contain regimen whether adjuvant setting metastatic/advanced disease . If doxorubicin give adjuvant therapy patient may include relapse occurs within year adjuvant therapy . If relapse occurs one year completion adjuvant therapy , patient must receive one prior regimen metastatic disease . Patient may receive one previous line therapy . Patients sex cord tumor may include prior treatment platinum contain regimen ( pretreatment doxorubicin contain regimen require patient subgroup ) . Patient least one site measurable nodal disease baseline ≥ 2.0 cm long transverse diameter clearly measurable least two perpendicular dimension , determine CT scan ( MRI allow CT scan perform ) . ECOG performance status ( PS ) ≤ 2 . Adequate haematological , liver renal function : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 G/L , Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL , Platelets ≥ 100 G/L , Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) ≥ low limit normal ( LLN ) correctable supplement , Magnesium ≥ LLN correctable supplement , Potassium ≥ LLN correctable supplement , Phosphorus ≥ LLN correctable supplement , Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( ≤ 5.0 x ULN liver metastasis present ) , Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN , If serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 x ULN , 24hour creatinine clearance must conduct result must ≥ 50 mL/min . Clinical euthyroidy ( patient permit receive thyroid hormone supplement treat underlying hypothyroidism ) . Ability swallow capsule tablet . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Mandatory affiliation health security insurance . Signed write informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Prior treatment HDAC HSP90 inhibitor drug . Unresolved toxicity ( ≥ Grade 1 ) prior therapy would , opinion investigator , compromise patient safety . Any following concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition could compromise participation study : Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease , include one following : Left ventricular systolic function ( LVEF ) determine MUGA scan echocardiogram &lt; center normal value , Complete leave bundle branch block , Obligate use cardiac pacemaker , Congenital long QT syndrome , History presence ventricular tachyarrhythmia , Presence unstable atrial fibrillation ( ventricular response &gt; 100bpm ) , Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 bpm ) , Mean correct QT interval ( QTcF n ≥ 3 ) ≥ 450 msec screen ECG , Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifasicular block ) , Angina pectoris ≤ 3 month prior start study drug , Acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) ≤ 3 month prior start study drug , History presence acute coronary syndrome , Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g . : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) , Impaired gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption LBH589 ( e.g . : ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , extensive small bowel resection ) , Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( e.g . : uncontrolled diabetes , active uncontrolled infection , chronic obstructive chronic restrictive pulmonary disease ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . Current treatment medication list appendix 04 , treatment discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug . The medication list appendix 04 relative risk prolong QT interval , induce Torsades de Pointes , inhibit CYP3A4/5 . Major surgery ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy . History brain metastasis . Absence least one metastatic lesion great equal 2cm pretreatment CT scan radiographic imaging define RECIST criterion ( appendix 02 ) . Systemic treatment anticancer drug , include investigational drug administer intermittent schedule last dose administer ≥ 4 week ago , patient recover ongoing toxicity prior study enrolment . Systemic treatment anticancer drug , include investigational drug administer chronic dosing schedule ( e.g . : daily dosing , everyotherday dosing , MWF weekly ) ≤ 5 halflives elapse since last dose , patient recover ongoing toxicity prior study enrolment .
