	<detailed_description>This study support R01AT005526-01 grant award NCCAM evaluate safety , efficacy , mechanism American ginseng HIV-related fatigue . This 4-week sequential drug interaction study measure effect American ginseng efavirenz pharmacokinetics use steady-state 24-hour AUC Cmax primary comparison measure healthy male volunteer . Efavirenz Cmin , T1/2 , tmax , clearance also assess secondary outcome measure . This study phase I , prospective , within-subject , fixed-order , two-period , multiple dose , open label , drug interaction study , determine stead-state plasma pharmacokinetic profile efavirenz concurrent treatment American ginseng . Therefore , study evaluate effect American ginseng efavirenz plasma concentration . Only efavirenz plasma concentration measure study . American ginseng plasma concentration assess study . Efavirenz plasma concentration measure study Days 14 28 ( correspond week 2 4 , respectively ) . This important study although American ginseng popular dietary supplement , safety efficacy agent HIV-infected patient yet establish . A major concern regard safety American ginseng HIV-infected patient potential herb-drug interaction could alter metabolism antiretroviral drug . Induction drug metabolize enzyme dietary supplement American ginseng , could lead reduction therapeutic concentration drug treatment failure . Inhibition drug metabolize enzyme , hand , could result high plasma concentration antiretroviral agent potentially lead increased toxicity . Most antiretroviral drug metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) isoenzyme CYP3A4 . Our preliminary data suggest American ginseng significantly affect CYP3A4 activity vivo . A recent study also report American ginseng-mediated induction UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme involve metabolism nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) zidovudine abacavir , integrase inhibitor raltegravir , significantly alter zidoduvine pharmacokinetics . However , data available concern effect American ginseng major CYP 450 isoforms involve metabolism antiretroviral drug . For instance , non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) efavirenz also metabolize CYP2B6 lesser extent CYP3A4 isoform . Therefore , potential drug interaction American ginseng popular NNRTI must exclude herb safely use HIV-infected patient . This study complete work currently do characterize effect American ginseng major drug metabolize enzyme . DURATION : The total duration study five week . Participants receive study medication first four week study . On week 5 participant complete final post treatment safety study visit . POPULATION AND SAMPLE SIZE : Fifteen adult healthy male volunteer enrol study . REGIMEN : Period 1 Days 0-14 Daily efavirenz monotherapy 600 mg orally Efavirenz pharmacokinetic sampling Day 14 Period 2 Days 15-28 Daily efavirenz 600 mg orally PLUS American ginseng 3000 mg orally Efavirenz pharmacokinetic sampling Day 28 Because efavirenz Category D drug positive evidence fetal risk , male healthy volunteer enrol study . Our hypothesis concurrent oral administration American ginseng 14 day significantly alter steady-state plasma pharmacokinetic efavirenz .</detailed_description>
