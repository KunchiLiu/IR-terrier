	<detailed_description>Aim : 1 . Study 3-dimensional anatomy nasal buttress . 2 . Diagnose fracture pattern nasal buttress . 3 . Identify buttress fracture associate deviation external nasal morphology . 4 . Identify buttress fracture associate septal deviation . 5 . Assess airflow pattern associate distribution flow velocity , pressure , wall shear stress nasal cavity patient specific model nose fracture . 6 . Assess stress distribution nasal bone structure subject various scenario load condition . Methodology : 67 consecutive patient admit facial fracture undergo routine CT scan face protocol axial coronal section take 0.6mm gantry 0 study . The CT scan evaluate assess position , comminution displacement 5 say buttress . The buttress grade Grade 1 Simple fracture without displacement Grade 2 Simple fracture displacement Grade 3 Comminuted fracture without displacement Grade 4 Comminuted fracture minimal displacement Grade 5 Comminuted fracture displacement The septum grade Grade 0 Septum straight Grade 1 Septum deviate less 1 half distance midline nasal turbinate Grade 2 Septum deviate 1 half distance midline nasal turbinate Grade 3 Septum almost touch nasal turbinate Variables assess include 1 . Grade Severity Nasal Septal fracture 1 . Which weak buttress commonly break ? 2 . Which least often fracture strong buttress ? 3 . Which buttress buttress involve undisplaced septal fracture ? 4 . Which buttress buttress involve displaced septal fracture ? 5 . Which buttress buttress involve undisplaced nasal fracture ? 6 . Which buttress buttress involve displaced nasal fracture ? 7 . For buttress displace , number fracture single buttress ? 2 . Assessment biomechanical stability 1 . Assessment stress distribution nasal buttress various scenario external loading 2 . Assessment nasal fracture pattern different traumatic force 3 . Assessment stress wave propagation nasal bone impact . 3 . Assessment nasal air-flow via nasal airway Methods data management analysis ( incl . Biostatistical check ) 1 . Segmentation Reconstruction 3D Nasal Model Given CT image patient , nasal bone surround facial bone segment 3D model bone reconstruct . This accomplish use segmentation 3D reconstruction software . We develop preliminary version software segment reconstruct 3D model craniofacial bone base fast marching method . The software adapt focus reconstruct 3D model nasal buttress . 2 . Nonlinear Registration Reference Model The 3D fracture model register normal reference model fracture analysis . A novel nonlinear registration technique require decouple normal variation among normal people variation due fracture . In way , normal reference model deform manner consistent normal variation register fracture model . After registration , register reference could serve model patient prior injury . Moreover , difference fracture model register reference would indicate variation due fracture . The extent fracture displacement bone also measure . To accomplish novel nonlinear registration , generalize form source separation method need . In particular , idea discriminates subspace analysis ( Zhang Sim ) develop colleague analyze variation facial image face recognition may applicable . The method decouple variation due different people variation due illumination view point . To enhance accuracy analysis , multiple normal reference model may require patient different ethnic group . 3 . Visualization 3D Models Generic visualization tool discriminate nasal bone craniofacial bone . It difficult inconvenient use visualize nasal structure . So , software tool develop visualize nasal structure fracture model . It also use visualize registration fracture model normal reference fracture analysis result . 4 . Classification Fracture Patterns After detect measure fractured bone , fracture model classify accord fracture pattern . This accomplish manually assistance classification software . Subsequently , 1 . Refinement Nonlinear Registration Method Refinement nonlinear registration method perform improve accuracy . 2 . Biomechanical study Three dimensional finite element model nose , particular septum construct CT scan . Finite element analysis carry assess deformation , stress wave propagation stress distribution nasal structure . Flow simulation use computational fluid dynamic also carry assess flow pattern nasal cavity due nasal fracture . Finally , 1 . Biomechanical study Three dimensional finite element model nose various propose technique correction nasal fracture carry assess strength weakness result nasal structure due corrective surgical procedure . Computation fluid dynamic also carry assess flow pattern nasal patency airway propose surgical correction .</detailed_description>
