	<brief_summary>Multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) sporadic neurodegenerative disorder adult associate poor prognosis . MSA clinically characterize association extra-pyramidal , dysautonomic , cerebellar pyramidal symptom . Histological biological study raise hypothesis , beside well know dopamine deficiency , symptom could relate dysfunction serotoninergic neurotransmission . Serotonin involved modulation several function impair MSA , mood , motricity sleep . The recent description association loss brainstem serotonin neuron sudden death patient MSA reinforce hypothesis critical role play neurotransmitter pathophysiology disease . Autoreceptors call 5-HT1a strongly involve regulation serotonin neurotransmission . During last year several radio-ligands allow vivo PET quantification 5-HT1a receptor , 18F-MPPF ( 4- ( 2'-methoxyphenyl ) -1- [ 2'- ( N-2 '' -piridinyl ) -p-fluorobenzamide ] methylpiperazine ) , develop . Moreover , investigator recently demonstrate ability brain functional imaging method investigate , healthy volunteer , functional property 5-HT1a autoreceptors evaluation desensitization single oral dose fluoxetine .</brief_summary>
