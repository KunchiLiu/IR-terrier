	<brief_summary>With participation international consortium investigator , investigator evaluate validity new severity score system call DS3 adult patient Gaucher disease . The investigator hypothesize initial DS3 score predictive disease progression pattern response include imiglucerase dose sensitivity completeness maintenance response sequential DS3 score accurately portray either clinical progression disease improvement response treatment . The investigator also collect DNA specimens future research use conjunction DS3 score evaluate determinant clinical course response treatments Gaucher disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validating New Severity Score System Adults With Type 1 Gaucher Disease ( GD1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GD1 prototypical lysosomal storage disorder first disorder compel evidence successful treatment enzyme replacement therapy . The common clinical manifestation hematologic cytopenia , hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , spectrum skeletal pathology . Disease expression diverse . The rate extent disease progression variable often independent age symptom first reported1 . Despite long history treatment efficacy2 , significant heterogeneity response among patient regard maximum improvement hematologic , visceral , bone , manifestation dynamic speed response therapy1-3 . There well-designed study comprehensively annotate phenotypic variation time measure treatment efficacy dose response . In part , attributable lack validate disease severity score system GD1 standardize monitoring progression treatment response define patient cohorts clinical study . DS3 method express integrated assessment burden disease give patient . It use monitor patient status , determine endpoint clinical study , classify disease phenotype compare patient disease . Although frequently refer 'disease severity index , ' DS3 instrument may also include measure disease activity damage . DS3s utilize minimal data set score patient comprehensive manner . They usually structure group domain ( often accord organ system ) populate non-redundant item valid , reliable , use feasible , standardized method assessment , variably weight base associate morbidity mortality . A DS3 adult GD1 patient recently develop subject successful preliminary testing validity , reliability feasibility4 . With respect change time , minimal clinically important difference define . Construct validity partially demonstrate . Using 20 patient profile International Collaborative Gaucher Group ( ICGG ) Gaucher Registry , instrument show correlate well `` gold standard '' clinical global impression scale . However , large scale test population representative world wide distribution GD1 phenotype ( include splenectomy patient ) need predictive validity yet determine . Moreover , DS3 yet correlate disease-specific measure response achievement therapeutic goal broadly use biomarkers . Combining retrospective prospective analysis , study design address issue</detailed_description>
