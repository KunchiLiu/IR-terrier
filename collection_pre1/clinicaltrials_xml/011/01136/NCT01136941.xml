	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test safety Zileuton see effect ( good bad ) , child adult Sickle Cell Disease ( SCD ) . The investigator also want see Zileuton handle body different dos . Zileuton drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment asthma people age 12 older . The FDA approve Zileuton treatment SCD , study investigational drug SCD application FDA . In asthma patient , Zileuton help reduce inflammation . This study see Zileuton help reduce inflammation associate SCD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inflammation recognize central pathophysiology sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , manifest leukocytosis , elevate level inflammatory cytokine , activation monocyte , polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) endothelial cell . It present steady state strongly associate acute event , acute chest early mortality . Inflammation contribute endothelial cell dysfunction , potentiate vaso-occlusion , may also give rise airway hyper-reactivity ( AHR ) often accompany SCD . A spectrum lung disease see patient population , AHR obstructive lung disease child , restrictive lung disease pulmonary vascular remodel adult . Evidence laboratory suggest specific angiogenic cytokine , Placenta Growth Factor produce hyperplastic erythroid marrow cell elevate SCD , contribute activation monocyte endothelial cell induce key leukotriene ( LT ) synthetic enzyme , 5-Lipoxygenase ( 5LO ) . 5LO increase production LT. LT among potent inflammatory mediator know . LT-B4 potent chemoattractant activator PMN enhance endothelial cell activation , cysteinyl LT produce airway smooth muscle constriction inflammation lung . Elevated LT-B4 cysteinyl LT , high incidence AHR observe patient SCD . Zileuton ( ZL ) specific inhibitor 5LO decrease LT production , FDA-approved treatment asthma individual 12 year age old . In context SCD , ZL reduce adhesion PMN sickle RBC rat pulmonary vasculature . In vitro data show ZL also increase fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) production erythroid cell vitro , could additive/synergistic effect hydroxyurea ( HU ) . Thus , ZL may beneficial SCD reduce inflammation , mitigate AHR , increase HbF . We hypothesize inhibition 5LO activity ZL safe , feasible ; significantly reduce leukotrienes biomarkers inflammation , decrease AHR ; induce HbF patient SCD . We test hypothesis Phase I study ZL SCD . First , establish safe dose ZL pharmacokinetics patient SCD . The secondary objective determine pharmacodynamic effect biological endpoint compliance twice daily ZL administration .</detailed_description>
