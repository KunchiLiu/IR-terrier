	<brief_title>An Open-Label , 2-Cohort , Multicenter , Study Lenvatinib Previously Treated Subjects With Unresectable Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , open-label , 2-cohort , 2-stage study assess ORR lenvatinib previously treat participant AJCC unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma disease progression . Cohort 1 enrol participant harbor V600E BRAF mutation disease progression follow 2 prior systemic anticancer regimen ( exclude anti-VEGF ) unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma , refer Cohort 1 V600E BRAF negative . Other less common BRAF activate mutation allow long participant receive BRAF-targeted therapy . Cohort 2 enrol participant harbor activate BRAF mutation ( mainly V600E mutation ) disease progression follow BRAF V600E-targeted therapy , refer Cohort 2 V600E BRAF positive . Eligible participant measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 .</detailed_description>
