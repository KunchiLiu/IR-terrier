	<brief_summary>Objective : To assess preemptive effect Bepanthen® decreasing incidence specific ≥ grade 2 dermatological side effect interest respect compliance EGFRI agent , HRQoL adherence 6-week skin treatment period . The adherence study cream also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bepanthen Versus Cetomacrogol Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitors ( EGFRI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Dermatological side effect , papulopustular eruption , xerosis , pruritus , periungual inflammation , mucosal- , hair abnormality , edema occur 90 % patient treatment epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor ( EGFRI ) . Patients hinder daily activity maintain privacy illness prominent side effect . The aesthetic discomfort , frequently associate itch painful skin nail lead decrease health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) dose reduction discontinuation anticancer treatment . Patients dermatological side effect also increase risk cutaneous infection ( least 38 % ) complicate dermatological side effect . At present , evidence effectiveness management option dermatological side effect lack , effect dermatological side effect HRQoL adherence remain poorly understood . Dexpanthenol cream ( Bepanthen® , Bayer ) use extensively ameliorate acute radiation induce skin toxicity , diaper dermatitis , irritant hand dermatitis , graft-donor site wound heal burn patient . The hypothesis skin heal possibility decrease kind side effect . Study design : Multicenter , two-arm randomized , double blind , prospective parallel group design , phase III study Study population : Each patient start first time EGFRI anticancer therapy cause papulopustular eruption ( cetuximab , panitumumab , erlotinib , gefitinib , lapatinib , ) , include . Intervention : 80 patient receive first 6 week treatment Bepanthen cream , 80 patient Cetomacrogol cream apply twice daily . Using FACT-EGFRI , dermatology-specific questionnaire , study examines effect side effect three domain HRQoL - symptom , emotion , function . Severity dermatological side effect assess use NCI-CTCAE v4.0 . Correlation dermatology HRQoL score NCI-CTCAE grade , sex , age , type EGFRI , cancer type conduct .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female subject ≥18 year age . Patients must sign approve informed consent form prior registration study . Histological proof cancer . A planned course EGFRI treatment type cancer . Patients must enter study ≤ 7 day EGFRI treatment begin . Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Ability complete questionnaire ( ) assistance . Patients need free infection use topical treatment skin . Use concurrent topical cream lotion baseline . Concomitant use medication may affect trial result ( e.a . concurrent use topical antibiotic , topical steroid , topical treatment face chest within 14 day Day 0 ( baseline ) ; treatment systemic antibiotic within 7 day prior Day 0 . Active dermatological condition papulopustular eruption may affect trial result . A skin examination reveals presence another skin disease face chest may obscure rash EGFRI and/or condition ( excessive facial hair , excessive scarring , sunburn , disfigurement ) locate skin , study physician 's opinion , would confound evaluation papulopustular eruption .
