	<detailed_description>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) utilize 18F-FDG nuclear medicine imaging technique evaluate glucose relate metabolic process provide information obtainable anatomic imaging . 18F-FDG PET scanning use clinically developed country Canadian jurisdiction primarily oncology patient also assess myocardial viability neurological condition . The functional information obtain 18F-FDG PET demonstrate significant impact patient management oncology.1 It use provide accurate pre-treatment staging , aid planning therapy , monitor response therapy , restaging , provide assessment recurrence curative therapy radiation treatment planning . Patients severe ischemic heart disease secondary myocardial dysfunction pose difficult management decision term surgical vs. medical management . Assessment viable myocardium integral decision 18F-FDG PET show one effective non-invasive method evaluation . 18F-FDG PET show effective neurology differentiate dementia type patient epilepsy surgical treatment consider . The Capital District Health Authority ( CDHA ) PET/CT program operate since June , 2008 date examine 2000 patient utilize Health Canada approve 18F-FDG produce Pharmalogic Montreal . A significant component PET Program infrastructure Nova Scotia Medical Imaging Research Centre ( MIRC NS ) include GMP grade radiopharmaceutical production lab cyclotron . This CTA allow evaluation 18F-FDG produce MIRC-NS similar case load prove clinical utility safety .</detailed_description>
