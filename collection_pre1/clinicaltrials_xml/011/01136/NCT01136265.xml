	<brief_summary>In study , investigator want pre-operatively scan patient clinically suspicion metastasis 18F-FDG-PET/CT whole body scan , go lymphoscintigraphy incl . SPECT/CT sentinel node biopsy . Material oral cancer , permission patient , also normal oral tissue analyze molecular-biologically . Also blood sample analyze molecular tumor marker . The investigator want see PET/CT able detect sign sub-clinically metastasis . Besides , investigator want fusion PET/CT SPECT/CT data lymphoscintigraphy study improve PET/CT scan dual-time PET scan head-and-neck region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/CT Sentinel Node Oral Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>These patient normally preoperatively sent CT scan thorax abdomen ; study , CT replace wholebody PET/CT scan . Afterwards , patient go sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy operation . By combine biomarkers molecular image patient clinically T1/T2N0M0 oral cancer , want characterize tumor physiologically correlate physiological feature clinical appearance cancer . Aims study : - PET/CT patient group metastases consequently change treatment ? - fusion SPECT/CT PET/CT calculation standardize uptake value ( SUV ) indicate , much tumor tissue positive sentinel node detect PET ? - dual-time PET scanning well determine lymph node metastasis , single-time PET scanning ? - correlation SUV PET molecular-biological finding primary tumor metastasis</detailed_description>
