	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Pemetrexed disodium may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give bevacizumab pemetrexed disodium alone combination effective treat non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study bevacizumab pemetrexed disodium alone combination induction therapy see well work treat patient advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Pemetrexed Disodium Alone In Combination After Induction Therapy Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient advance non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat maintenance therapy bevacizumab v pemetrexed disodium v bevacizumab pemetrexed disodium follow induction therapy . Secondary - To determine response rate patient treat regimen . - To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat regimen . - To define toxicity regimens patient . - To determine frequency polymorphism VEGF 3578 AA , 1154 AA , ABCB1 G2677TT/AA , ERCC-118 TT patient treat induction therapy comprise paclitaxel , carboplatin bevacizumab determine association genotype response rate . - To determine association bevacizumab pemetrexed disodium population pharmacokinetics patient-specific covariate bevacizumab pemetrexed disodium toxicity . - To determine frequency TSER*3 polymorphisms NSCLC association TSER polymorphism benefit pemetrexed disodium . - To evaluate TS ERCC1 expression RT-PCR MTAP mutation exist tumor specimen predictor pemetrexed disodium response . - To evaluate polymorphism within CYPs 2C8 , 3A4 , 3A5 and/or UGT1A1 collectively monogenically marker variation efficacious and/or toxic response individual treatment taxanes . - To explore association proteomic profile ICAM , VEGF , FGF-beta clinical outcome study ( OS , PFS , response ) ( Closed 04/01/2010 ) . - To evaluate ability FOX03a predict first-line treatment outcome non-squamous NSCLC . ( Closed 04/01/2010 ) - To evaluate ability ADSS1 predict outcome pemetrexed maintenance treatment non-squamous NSCLC . ( Closed 04/01/2010 ) - To develop proteomic classifier identify patient population would benefit bevacizumab pemetrexed therapy . ( Closed 04/01/2010 ) OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord gender ( male v female ) , stage disease ( IIIB-T4Nx [ nodule ipsilateral lung lobe candidate combine chemotherapy radiation ] IV M1a v IV M1b v recurrent ) , best response first-time therapy ( complete response/partial response v stable disease ) , smoke status ( never vs smoker ) . - Induction therapy : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour , carboplatin IV 15-30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Maintenance Therapy : Patients achieve complete response , partial response stable disease follow induction therapy randomize 1 3 treatment arm . Treatment begin within 6 week last day induction chemotherapy administration . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . - Arm III : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I pemetrexed arm II . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study pharmacokinetics , protein biomarkers , proteomic profiling ( close 04/01/10 ) , analysis . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 2-5 year .</detailed_description>
