	<brief_title>Age-related Variability Efficacy Tolerability Alternative Pituitary Suppression Regimens ART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pituitary suppression strongly advise include within follicular stimulation protocol avoid occurrence premature LH surge , lead cycle cancellation . However , whatever drug schedule select achieve , clear pituitary suppression constitute major perturbation endocrine milieu impact outcome stimulation . Indeed , data literature support idea pituitary down-regulation GnRH agonists accord so-called long protocol , result deep suppression , result well clinical outcome compare short protocol , least woman younger reproductive age . Conversely , propose less profound suppression ( e.g . short protocol ) , allow good background regulation pituitary , preferred woman advance reproductive age . However , majority data currently support decision maker select pituitary suppression strategy base study focus standard , good prognosis patient whereas study specifically address special issue advance reproductive age . Inasmuch , data available pure ( non resistant ) advance age patient , however , study compare set young v age subject adequate sample size . Another intriguing aspect question chronological age necessarily overlap reproductive age , besides complicate decisional process clinical practise , may also play confound factor evaluation result clinical trial . Several study validate role so-called follicle antral count ( AFC ) anti-Mullerian hormone ( AMH ) circulating level predictive role evaluation actual reproductive age . In particular latter , AMH , appear easy standardise use best reference multicentre clinical study focus reproductive age . In summary , clear lack information performance different GnRH-agonist schedule alternative chronological reproductive age group data large size prospective trial may generate valuable indication daily clinical practise .</detailed_description>
