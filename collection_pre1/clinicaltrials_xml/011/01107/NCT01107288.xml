	<brief_title>Effects Music-Based Multitask Exercises Program Gait , Balance Fall Risk Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Falls among common devastate concern face old adult . The scope problem continue expand number old adult project increase dramatically come decade . Since fall occur result complex interaction risk factor , considerable evidence document gait instability poor balance capacity two major contributor fall . A large proportion fall elderly people experience walk , advance age , old adult likely fall engage concurrent task . Gait variability , particularly dual-task walking condition , may provide objective measure characterize impaired execution gait , great variability place old adult increase risk fall . Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics , approach music education movement develop composer Emile Jaques-Dalcroze ( 1865-1960 ) Geneva early 20th century , currently practice worldwide field music , well dance , theatre therapy . Initially intended music student , Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics soon expand extensively music education child adolescents world . The main focus method develop rhythmicality musicality well strengthen body awareness , coordination , expression , verbal social skill . Recently , Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics class older adult develop . Those class engage elderly vary multitask exercise perform rhythm improvised piano music , sometimes manipulation object ( e.g. , instrument percussion , ball ) . Basic exercise consist walk follow music , respond directly change music 's rhythmic pattern . In cross-sectional study perform long-term Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics user , age-related increase stride-to-stride variability appear attenuate ( Kressig , 2005 ) . The effectiveness intervention achieve improvement gait variability old adult without previous experience Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics need confirm prospectively . Method This randomize controlled trial design assess efficacy 6-month community-based Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program improve gait balance , reduce fall risk elderly people increase risk fall . The primary objective ass efficacy intervention reduce gait variability . Change gait variability dual-task condition 6 month primary endpoint . The main secondary objective assess effect quantitative gait balance measure , functional test performance , fall . Volunteer participant recruit Geneva area ( Switzerland ) flyer , press release advertisement local community newspaper . Individuals age 65 old , community-dwelling identify high risk fall randomly assign , accord computer-generated list , either immediate Jaques-Dalcroze eurhythmics program weekly 1-hour class 6 month wait-list control group schedule receive intervention 6 month follow completion baseline assessment . Participants intervention group follow additional 6 month order evaluate whether intervention gain maintain time . Main outcome measure include gait ( single dual-task condition ) balance performance assess quantitative analysis ( i.e. , electronic walkway angular velocity transducer ) functional test administer baseline , 6 12 month . Falls data prospectively ascertained whole follow-up use monthly calendar method daily record . The principal analysis do intention treat basis . Following completion 12-month follow-up , subject option continue class via Jaques-Dalcroze Institute . Subjects invite enter extension phase trial participate follow-up assessment visit schedule four year follow original trial enrolment .</detailed_description>
