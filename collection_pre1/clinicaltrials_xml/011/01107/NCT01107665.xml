	<brief_summary>This Phase II single-arm , open-label , clinical trial evaluate efficacy safety pazopanib combination paclitaxel first line therapy subject unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma . Previous cytokine therapy permit . Subjects must measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Subjects candidate curative intent treatment eligible study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Paclitaxel First-Line Treatment Subjects With Unresectable Stage III Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment study administer 4-week cycle . Paclitaxel administer intravenously start dose 80mg/m2 weekly 3 week follow 1-week rest . Pazopanib administer orally , continuous regimen , start dose 800mg daily . Approximately 60 eligible subject enrol 24 month period . 21 subject enter first stage 2-stage Simon Minimax design . If 3 response , 39 additional subject enrol Stage 2 . The minimum number response require move second stage , &gt; 3 , note first 9 patient treatment , study proceed towards goal accrue 60 total patient . Subjects permit receive supportive care throughout study include transfusion blood blood product , treatment antibiotic , anti-emetics , anti-diarrheal agent , analgesic , erythropoietin , filgrastim ( Neupogen ) , bisphosphonates , appropriate . Subjects continue treatment study objective disease progression document accord RECIST withdrawal study reason . Subjects discontinue treatment paclitaxel prior disease progression continue treatment pazopanib . Subjects discontinue agent prior progressive disease ( PD ) follow tumor assessment PD , initiation subsequent anti-cancer therapy absence document PD , death , whichever occur first . Subjects may continue treatment beyond time RECIST-defined progression discretion investigator subject perceive experience clinical benefit . Overall survival assess 2 year first study treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must provide write informed consent prior performance studyspecific procedures assessment , must willing comply treatment follow . Procedures conduct part subject 's routine clinical management ( e.g. , blood count , image study ) obtain prior signing inform consent may utilize screen baseline purpose provide procedure conduct specify protocol . Note : It necessary inform consent obtain within protocolspecified screen window . 2 . Histologically confirm cutaneous melanoma 1 ) unresectable Stage III disease , 2 ) Stage IV disease American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) criterion . 3 . Must measurable disease [ i.e . least one measurable lesion , per RECIST ] . A measurable lesion define lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥20mm use conventional technique ≥10mm spiral CT scan . Note : Subjects exclude baseline measurable lesion within previously irradiate area . Subjects participate exploratory analysis shall biopsied lesion ( ) sit measurable disease . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 5 . Age 18 year old old 6 . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal Subjects use hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) must experience total cessation menses ≥1 year great 45 year age , OR , questionable case , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) value &gt; 40 milliinternational unit ( mIU ) /mL estradiol value &lt; 40pg/mL ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) . Subjects must discontinue HRT prior study enrollment due potential inhibition Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes metabolize estrogen progestin . For form HRT , least 24 week must elapse cessation HRT determination menopausal status ; length interval depend type dosage HRT . If female subject determine postmenopausal , must use adequate contraception , define immediately . Childbearing potential , include female negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior first dose study treatment , preferably close first dose possible , agree use adequate contraception . Acceptable contraceptive method , use consistently accordance product label instruction physician , follow : An intrauterine device document failure rate le 1 % per year . Vasectomized partner sterile prior female subject 's entry sole sexual partner female . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse 14 day exposure investigational product , dose period , least 21 day last dose investigational product . Doublebarrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) . Note : Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drug drug interaction . Female subject lactate discontinue nursing prior first dose study drug refrain nursing throughout treatment period 14 day follow last dose study drug . A male female partner childbearing potential eligible enter participate study use barrier method contraception abstinence study . 7 . Adequate organ system function define : System : Laboratory Values Hematologic Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = .5 X 10^9/L Hemoglobin &gt; = 9 g/dL International normalized ratio ( INR ) &lt; = 1.2 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &lt; = 1.2 X ULN Hepatic Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X ULN Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; =2.5 x ULN Renal Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; = 30 mL/min Note : Subjects may transfusion within 7 day screen assessment .

Known history doselimiting hypersensitivity reaction paclitaxel/Cremophor EL . 4 . Pregnant lactate female . Female subject lactate eligible discontinue nurse prior first dose study drug refrain nursing throughout treatment period 14 day follow last dose study drug . 5 . Melanoma ocular origin . 6 .
