	<brief_title>Different Techniques Emergency Cricothyroidotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : In patient intubate ventilated conventional mean emergency cricothyroidotomy potentially life save intervention common final pathway difficult airway algorithms . Significant debate surround ideal method perform emergency cricothyroidotomy . The literature remain divide open ( surgical ) close ( wire assist , Seldinger ) technique . We feel two method mutually exclusive proposing novel `` incision first '' modification traditional Seldinger close technique . Making small ( 1 cm ) incision prior needle insertion could facilitate localization landmark may improve speed success rate close Seldinger procedure . Introduction : In patient intubate ventilated conventional mean emergency cricothyroidotomy potentially life save intervention common final pathway difficult airway algorithms . Significant debate surround ideal method perform emergency cricothyroidotomy . The literature remain divide open ( surgical ) close ( wire assist , Seldinger ) technique . We feel two method mutually exclusive proposing novel `` incision first '' modification traditional Seldinger close technique . Making small ( 1 cm ) incision prior needle insertion could facilitate localization landmark may improve speed success rate close Seldinger procedure . Methods : Using conceal allocation , randomize control cross-over trial perform laboratory setting . Outcome assessment blind . Both staff resident emergency physician include trial . We use well-validated swine trachea model study . Results : Results collect use standardized Case Report Forms ( CRF ) independently enter pre-constructed Microsoft ACCESS database . The primary outcome time procedure completion . Secondary outcome proportion successful cricothyroidotomy , complication ease procedure ability increase clinical confidence use model . Paired t-tests Fisher 's exact test use compare outcome due multiple statistical test , correction use adjust multiple test ( p &lt; 0.025 ) indicate significance . Conclusions : This study ass evaluate incision first model close Seldinger cricothyroidotomy technique . We discuss merit technique effectiveness model .</detailed_description>
