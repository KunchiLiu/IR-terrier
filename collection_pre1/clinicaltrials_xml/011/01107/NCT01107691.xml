	<brief_title>Comparison 1 v 3 Sets Resistance Training Muscular Hypertrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct randomize control efficacy trial ( RT-1 set vs. RT-3 set vs. non exercise control ) evaluate potential long intervention ( 9 month RT body composition assessments 1 yr post RT completion ) high volume RT ( 3 set ) enhance effect body composition energy expenditure observe pilot , determine impact 2 level RT free-living energy balance ( expenditure doubly label water intake digital photography 24-hr recall ) . This investigation conduct sample healthy , normal overweight , sedentary , young adult men woman ; group high risk development overweight obesity . The specific aim project determine impact volume ( 1 vs. 3 set ) progressive RT protocol induce muscular hypertrophy , recommend American College Sports Medicine , body weight body composition ( fat mass , fat-free mass ( FFM ) , % body fat ) energy balance . Our result provide information relative minimum volume RT may associate body weight/fat gain may inform development guideline RT prevent weight gain alter body composition . If RT favorable impact energy balance body composition , may provide attractive alternative aerobic exercise weight management busy young adult , RT require minimal time , need change clothes shower ( i.e . minimal sweating ) .</detailed_description>
