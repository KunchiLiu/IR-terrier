	<brief_title>Heart Function HIV-Negative Children Exposed HIV HAART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Significance : Approximately 700,000 child annually bear HIV-infected mother throughout world , advent perinatal highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , majority child bear uninfected Westernized nation uninfected increase develop nation . Uninfected child expose HIV HAART utero , subclinical leave ventricular dysfunction ( LVD ) birth may predispose heart failure , conduction abnormality myocardial infarction later life . The impact LVD future cardiac risk unclear unknown LVD child persist , worsen resolve pre-pubescence . Study objectives : The objective study characterize leave ventricular function HIV-negative pre-pubertal child bear HIV+ woman expose HIV HAART utero compare age gender match healthy child bear HIV-negative woman . Through objective determine LVD HIV-negative child bear HIV+ woman expose HAART utero persists , worsens , resolve pre-pubescence . If LVD persists worsen pre-pubescence , data lead future study examine mechanisms treatment LVD child significantly impact clinical monitoring care child . If LVD resolve pre-pubescence , data provide important information clinical cardiac monitoring may critical population . Methods : We plan examine leave ventricular function 30 HIV-negative child bear HIV+ woman expose HAART utero compare 30 healthy age gender match child bear HIV-negative woman . Left ventricular function examine 2-D , Doppler Tissue Doppler image echocardiography use General Electric Vivid 7Â® ultrasound machine . Left ventricular measure include left ventricular structure dimension , systolic diastolic flow rate , wall velocity systole diastole systolic diastolic strain strain rate ( sensitive measure myocardial contractility ) . Echocardiographic measure take place Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory ( CVIL ) Washington University School Medicine certify cardiac ultrasonographer data process , analyze interpret ultrasonographer , consult cardiologist principal investigator . Outcomes : Primary outcome include measure leave ventricular function : leave ventricular mass , leave ventricular end diastolic dimension , fractional shortening , systolic diastolic wall velocity ( tissue Doppler imaging ) systolic diastolic strain strain rate ( 2-D speckle track methodology ) .</detailed_description>
