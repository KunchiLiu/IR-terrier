	<brief_title>Evaluation Physical Fitness After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause chronic severe disability . More 50 % stroke survivor residual motor functional deficit impact participation quality live ( Patel et al , 2006 ) . Limitations daily function may lead physical inactivity sedentary lifestyle . Sustained physical inactivity ( deconditioning ) induces reduction aerobic capacity , may increase risk cardiovascular disease individual associate stroke . Therefore , improve aerobic capacity may essential prevention secondary disease due lack fitness stroke population . Previous study also indicate critical level aerobic capacity must meet order function independently ( Cress et al , 2003 ) . Therefore , addition disease prevention , enhance aerobic capacity individual stroke may also beneficial effect promote functional ability independent living . It also know limitation functional performance mostly associate restriction social activity ( ICIDH-2-model ) . Clearly , stroke survivor benefit counsel participation physical activity exercise training . A recent meta-analysis ( Pang et al , 2006 ) show good evidence support use aerobic exercise improve aerobic capacity individual stroke . However , go road , one need know level physical activity physical fitness stroke population .</detailed_description>
