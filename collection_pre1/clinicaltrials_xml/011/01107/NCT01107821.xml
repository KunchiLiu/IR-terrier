	<brief_summary>Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) become powerful tool wound bed preparation complex wound routinely use various discipline , include general surgery plastic surgery . NPWT involve creation control subatmospheric pressure wound bed . The vacuum generate pump distribute wound bed dressing ( mostly foam gauze sponge ) . The therapy several positive effect wound bed , improve local blood circulation , stimulation granulation tissue formation control evacuation wound exudate . Standard negative pressure apply mostly vary -120 mmHg -130 mmHg.A new way apply NPWT Engenex™ system use Bio-Dome™ Wound Dressing , specially engineer structure form define space surface wound . This space maintain size integrity presence negative pressure wound fluid thus effectively impose strain underlying tissue . The material property dress permit moist wound heal encourage efficient removal exudate . The contact material absorb fluid . It clinically show Bio-Dome™ Wound Dressing effective grow granular tissue base wind safe low negative pressure -75 mmHg , possibly reduce dress ingrowth wound bed minimum . Our intention evaluate NPWT mean Engenex™ pump Bio- Dome™ Wound Dressing 15 patient . Patients large soft tissue defect examine plastic surgeon suitable NPWT treat Engenex™ NPWT system . Before start NPWT wound evaluate measure ( length , width , depth , volume ) possible . Digital photo make wound swab take microbiological examination.Dressing change perform twice weekly , Monday Thursday Tuesday Friday . At dress change wound re-evaluated measure . Other parameter note , amongst others : pain , comfort , ease use , material use , time need dress change , etc . The NPWT treatment carry maximum three week . During period plastic surgeon evaluate whether wound ready surgical closure . If surgical closure 3 week yet option possibility exist NPWT continue . Every wound follow complete wound heal surgical closure . All patient data record , secure , evaluate analysed medical parameter health economic parameter .</brief_summary>
