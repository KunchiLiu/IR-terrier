	<brief_summary>Venothromboembolic disease ( VTE ) , include deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , severe health problem , effect 1.5/1000 per year general population . In patient 60 year age , incidence 1/100 per year . Of two million Americans per year develop VTE , one third develop pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . VTE usually diagnose Doppler ultrasound contrast venography present extremity , VQ scan pulmonary angiography PE present . However , many instance diagnosis VTE conventional modality limit . These include obesity , recent trauma surgery , presence mass , presence clot around central line , clot occur abdomen pelvis . Furthermore , differentiation new old clot evade diagnostic imaging modality , exist modality allow accurate delineation site thrombus within body . New approach diagnostic image VTE complicate case need . The first hypothesis project FDG PET/CT use accurately diagnose presence extent acute VTE , distinguish new clot old . Approximately 20-25 % new case venous thromboembolism occur know cancer patient . The risk VTE 4-6 fold great patient cancer without ( 8-12 % vs. 2 % , respectively , lifetime risk ) . In many case , development VTE occur first clinical sign cancer , even diagnose . Among patient present acute VTE obvious cause ( define `` idiopathic '' `` unprovoked '' , oppose `` secondary '' VTE ) , literature report 20 % ( range report incidence 7-20 % ) may ultimately prove cancer , depend series whether thrombosis unifocal multifocal . Despite substantial prevalence occult cancer patient present idiopathic VTE , current recommendation patient screen presence cancer . The second hypothesis project FDG PET/CT accurately use screen presence cancer patient unprovoked ( idiopathic ) acute VTE . Objectives : There two specific objective test hypothesis associate project : 1 . To establish sensitivity FDG PET/CT diagnosis acute VTE . 2 . To perform pilot project aid design large trial define incidence occult cancer patient rigorously select idiopathic ( unprovoked ) VTE , investigate value FDG PET early detection occult cancer population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study AIM # 1 To establish sensitivity FDG PET/CT diagnosis acute VTE . Rationale : We believe FDG PET/CT use accurately diagnose presence , extent , acuity VTE . It unrealistic assume FDG-PET could become primary imaging modality evaluate VTE . The cost , compare Doppler ultrasound , would prohibitive , would involve unnecessary radiation patient . We intend establish value FDG PET , instead , alternative modality diagnosis VTE . Clinical situation might prove useful include : 1 ) presence old clot , distinction new old may important ; 2 ) evaluation abdominal , pelvic thoracic thrombus , Doppler difficult-to-impossible patient obesity ; 3 ) Complicated anatomy due presence tumor post-therapeutic change . The sensitivity FDG PET/CT establish patient acute VTE . The accuracy sit abnormal FDG uptake relate , spatially , vascular structure critical success study . There little doubt well accomplish PET/CT PET alone . PET/CT use study . Patients document acute VTE , enrol . To determine utility FDG PET/CT distinguish acute subacute chronic clot , establish extent acute clot , initial whole body PET/CT scan must perform within 2 week onset symptom DVT , subsequent limited region PET/CT scan perform 2-3 week 6 week follow initial PET/CT scan . Whenever possible , subject recruit unprovoked VTE potential benefit patient participate study great patient high risk harbor underlie occult malignancy . However , patient provoke unprovoked VTE eligible enrollment specific aim .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Inclusion criterion include document acute DVT ( +/PE ) Doppler ultrasound contrast venography . 2 . Subjects eligible either provoke unprovoked DVT . 3 . To meet inclusion criterion , patient must enrol initial PET/CT scan perform within 2 week initial onset symptom VTE . 1 . Subjects less 18 year age , 2 . Those unable understand provide signature inform consent 3 . Pregnant subject . Any female childbearing age uterus functional ovary undergo serum pregnancy test prior inclusion . 4 . Subjects calfonly blood clot exclude , due fact case often complicate venous stasis disease , postphlebitic syndrome , presence acute chronic clot , may compromise interpretation .</criteria>
