	<brief_title>The Beneficial Effects Protein-rich Breakfast Appetite Control &amp; Cognition Overweight Obese Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breakfast skipping , common , yet unhealthy dietary habit among young woman , strongly associate over-eating ( especially even ) , weight gain , obesity . Breakfast skipping also show reduce cognitive function population . However , unclear whether addition breakfast , specific emphasis increase dietary protein , lead improvement outcomes . This study provide mechanistic evidence support addition protein-rich breakfast improve and/or re-establish appetite control , energy intake regulation , cognitive function overweight/obese 'breakfast skip ' young woman . 25 overweight obese 'breakfast skip ' adolescent girl participate follow randomized within-subject crossover-design breakfast study . The participant randomly complete follow breakfast pattern home 6 day : 1 ) Breakfast Skipping ; 2 ) Consumption Normal Protein breakfast meal ( i.e. , 350 kcal ; 15 % meal protein , 65 % CHO , &amp; 20 % fat ) ; 3 ) Consumption Protein-Rich breakfast meal ( i.e. , 350 kcal ; 40 % meal protein , 40 % CHO , &amp; 20 % fat ) . On 7th day pattern , participant report MU-Brain Imaging Center morning complete respective 10-h test day . The participant begin test day either skip breakfast consume respective breakfast meal . Blood sample assessment perceive appetite , pleasure/reward , cognitive function collected/completed specific time throughout day . A standardized lunch also provide . Prior dinner , brain scan complete use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify brain activation pattern response food picture . Following fMRI , participant provide ad libitum dinner buffet consume facility . They also give even snack consume ad libitum , home throughout remainder day . There 7-day washout period breakfast pattern . Primary outcome include morning , mid-day , afternoon , even appetite , satiety , pleasure/reward , hormonal response ( plasma glucose , insulin , ghrelin , PYY concentration ) , brain activation pattern , even energy intake , daily energy intake .</detailed_description>
