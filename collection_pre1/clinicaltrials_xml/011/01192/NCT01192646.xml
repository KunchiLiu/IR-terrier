	<brief_summary>Background The maternal mortality ratio Tanzania persistently high ten year sign ratio go down.The Tanzania Demographic Health Survey ( TDHS ) 1999 2005 estimate maternal mortality ratio 528 578 per 100,000 live birth respectively ( TDHS 1999 , TDHS 2004/05 ) .The major direct cause include obstetric haemorrhage , obstruct labour , pregnancy induce hypertension , sepsis abortion complication . Most delivery ( 53 % ) Tanzania occur outside health facility . Of 53 % birth occur outside health facility 31 % attended relative , 19 % traditional births attendant ( TBA ) 3 % assistance . Though , proportional mother deliver health facility ( 47 % ) receiving skilled attendance birth ( 46 % ) low 94 percent woman attend antenatal care ( ANC ) health facility least . This indicate factor impede woman deliver health facility . Low awareness obstetric danger sign may one contribute factor delay decide seek care complication occur thus contribute first phase delay . Studies Tanzania show woman aware danger sign obstetric complication pregnancy , delivery delivery . A study conduct Mtwara rural ass use determinant skilled attendant delivery show proportional woman deliver skilled care increase increase knowledge pregnancy danger sign , also show woman knowledge pregnancy danger sign An increase body evidence support importance community participation maternal infant health program establish ownership , identify problem effectively , achieve equity help institutionalize health program . To mount effective maternal health effort aim reduce maternal infant mortality , multiple level program policy need place functioning . In addition , linkage , community , local dispensary health centre first referral hospital adequately equip , need develop sustain A home base life save skill ( HBLSS ) strategy intend educate pregnant woman primary family caregiver home birth attendant critical knowledge skill keep pregnant woman healthy , recognize life-threatening maternal newborn complication promote adoption health care health-seeking behaviour individual community level . The aim strategy prevent maternal neonatal morbidity mortality create awareness woman 's birth preparedness access emergency obstetric care service RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 .

	<detailed_description>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM AND RATIONALE Despite several intervention address unacceptably high rate maternal neonatal mortality , problem still persist . Maternal Mortality ratio Tanzania persistently high without sign decline . Currently stand 578 950 per 100,000 live birth ( TDHS 2005 , WHO 2007 ) . The neonatal mortality rate well country 32 per 1,000 live birth ( TDHS 2005 ) . Almost 94 % pregnant woman attend antenatal care health facility least , 47 % deliver facility skilled attendance birth 46 % ( TDHS 2005 , Mpembeni et al 2007 ) . Births occur outside health facility assist relative , TBA woman assistance ( Kayombo 1995 , Kayombo 2008 , Comonsky 1983 ) . Studies Tanzania show home birth unskilled attendant often norm ( TDHS 1999 , TDHS 2005 , Mpembeni 2007 ) . This indicate factor impede woman deliver health facility . Among factor may include socio-cultural , economic activity , family , community factor . If factor compound low awareness danger sign obstetric complication woman neonates risk death complication occur . Previous study Rufiji district show community low acceptance facility delivery referral hospital advise ( Pembe 2008b ) . Furthermore , like part Tanzania woman low knowledge danger sign complication pregnancy , delivery delivery despite attend antenatal care ( Mpembeni 2007 , Pembe 2008a ) . In another study use essential obstetric care facility , quarter ( 60/232 ) woman complication refer hospital level less half ( 48 % ) arrive referral point . Out 60 referred case 31 ( 52 % ) arrive two hospital district . Nineteen trace outcome find three died way hospital ( Urassa 2005 ) . Consequently , great need innovative empower community-based intervention whose characteristic address problem . METHODOLOGY DESIGN This cluster randomize trial . The cluster choose intervention do community group rather individual . The unit randomization health care facility . Randomly select facility cluster receive HBLSS addition antenatal care receive control group routine ANC do . Study area This study conduct Rufiji district . Rufiji district one six district Coastal Region Tanzania . It situate 300 km Southern capital city Dar e Salaam . The district rural suburban area . The district estimate population 203,102 accord census result 2002 male population 98,398 female 104,704 ( BoS 2002 ) . Geographically Rufiji river divide district two half Northern Southern part formation flood plain , coastal-delta , plateau zone . Since inauguration `` Mkapa '' bridge 2003 across Rufiji river , transport northern southern part district well southern region improve . Only main road Dar es Salaam Southern region passable season , road district difficult pas especially rainy season . The limited transport system make people dependent health service available within district . According administrative structure Tanzania , district divide five division , divide 19 ward . There eight ward flood plain , four coastal-delta , seven plateau zone . There 128 village district . Each village 2 4 hamlet ( Vitongoji ) leadership hamlet chairperson . The average population village 1600 , therefore annual population growth rate 4 % estimate 64 woman become pregnant year . The district two hospital , Utete government district hospital Mchukwi private profit hospital own Pentecostal church . Both hospital doctor , nurse midwife provide medical care surgical care include comprehensive emergency obstetric care . There four rural health centre ( RHCs ) 52 dispensary two private profit another two private profit . Antenatal care ( ANC ) provide hospital , RHCs dispensary . The normal practice pregnant woman register antenatal care near health facility . Dispensaries RHCs guideline refer woman risk complication hospital . Participants Randomly select facility cluster receive HBLSS addition antenatal care receive routine antenatal care . The unit randomization health facility . 28 health facility select randomise two group 14 facility . One group provide HBLSS educational programme VHW another group monitor purpose comparison Key participant pregnant woman together immediate relative aunt husband . They receive HBLSS training . Village health worker train HBLSS trainer , use provide train community Intervention The select cluster receive HBLSS training . This training conduct part Tanzania . The HBLSS procedure The HBLSS conceive component Community Partnership Safe Motherhood Model . It target homebirth team consist expect present birth , namely , pregnant woman , family caregiver , birth attendant . The education , motivation , cohesion mobilization pregnant woman , family community see necessary improve pregnancy outcome . HBLSS training design American College Nurse-midwives successfully implement develop country include India Ethiopia ( Sibley et al 2001 ) . In Tanzania adopt adapt use launch Honourable Mohamed Shein Vice President United Republic Tanzania 25th March 2007 Morogoro . The White Ribbon Alliance ( WRA ) adapt HBLLS train curriculum take consideration major cause maternal mortality region Tanzanian context , translate Swahili . The training material field test first Training trainer ( TOTs ) train community do Manyara region . Other training ongoing . Recently WRA conduct train Rukwa rural district involve district health provider , 20 primary health care provider 500 community member 20 village . HIV awareness prevention mother-to-child HIV transmission integrate train manual . The strategy build exist practice negotiate acceptable feasible safe practice homebirth team member develop consensus appropriate action capacity take action need . The HBLSS training manual flexible , modular design comprise 12 preventive life save skill topic . Drawing best practice current research , maximize effective communication learn among community member may unable read , essential content reinforce pictorial Take Action Cards take home reference . The trainer use various teach method maximize effective communication learn among participant include : - Stories case histories - Discussion demonstration - Identification complication use picture card - Take Action Cards . - There one Take Action Card topic problem . These card use train booklet make card leave woman 's home . HBLSS sensitization train The HBLSS training district start ten ( 10 ) TOTs train district level . These train research assistant ( RAs ) preferably community health worker ( VHW ) health assistant , one select village . The RAs train community HBLSS . All pregnant mother identify RA . The RA make appointment family accord convenience . The RA visit family every month discus danger sign , decision making , birth preparedness emergency readiness family . The RA keep record train family , number visit make whether woman attend antenatal care develop complication . When woman deliver RA record place delivery whether referral give . Sample size : Baseline study Since study employ cluster-sampling , technique , design effect take consideration calculate sample size . We use design effect 2 value report recent Demographic Health Surveys design effect variable `` Mothers receive medical assistance delivery '' Coastal Zone study conduct . Therefore use formula take consideration design effect , minimum 766 woman require baseline survey . Sample size Cluster Randomized control trial The sample size intervention study cluster randomize trial calculate use Acluster programme method describe Donner Klar , 2000 . We estimate mean cluster size 100 pregnant woman , intracluster correlation coefficient 0.05 . We assume power 90 % detect increase 15 % rate hospital delivery . In case need 28 cluster , 14 intervention group 14 control . We need 1347 woman intervention group 1347 control group . A 20 % increase do offset loss follow-up . Sequence generation This do include woman book antenatal care time study , control intervention cluster . Allocation concealment Four health center choose randomly intervention control ( 2 ) . Then random selection 24 dispensary do use random number table . Allocation intervention control do randomly lottery method . Statistical method Analysis do take consideration clustering . Primary analysis undertaken intention treat cluster level individual level . Pearson Chi-square test use compare variable . The result deem significant p value &lt; 0.05 . Multiple logistical regression method also use see predictor variable use health facility delivery . This do cluster individual level . DATA COLLECTION Baseline information The provision emergency obstetric care service use United Nations ( UN ) signal function Safe motherhood Initiative ( SMI ) assessment tool facility do . Health worker interview determine capability undertake emergency obstetric care facility . Birth preparedness , emergency readiness include awareness danger sign obstetric neonatal complication among woman , spouse , head household family member do . Information male involvement also seek . A structured questionnaire use gather information . Information relate traditionally prefer and/or recommend discourage food pregnancy also collect . In addition , information traditional practice include ritual first last born child twin document . Qualitative interview include focus group discussion ( FGDs ) in-depth interview conduct . FGDs do community perception , attitude , male involvement health seek behaviour use emergency obstetric care service . In-depth interview conduct key informant religious leader opinion people community compliment data perception place delivery obstetric neonatal danger sign . In-depth interview also conduct health care provider supplement documentation focus factor make many woman deliver outside health facility effort make make deliver health facility . In addition review report ward health committee see maternal newborn feature report sign awareness . Information traditional pregnancy management practice , include use herbal plant preparation facilitate child delivery perceive safety collect . Plants use collect botanic identification do botanist scientific name literature review safety . In addition possible concoction use facilitate child delivery manage pregnancy infant health problem collect laboratory screening . Information qualitative study also help prepare instrument quantitative study . Topic guide use FGDs in-depth interview . We also conduct economic valuation train obtain cost-effectiveness analysis type educational program . DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS Quantitative data : When data collection complete , serial number assign questionnaire facilitate identification different patient data . Thereafter responses open-ended question review , categorize cod computer data entry . Data entry computer do principal investigator help assistant use statistical package social science ( SPSS ) EPI INFO6 computer programme . Data cleaning do . Chi- squared test use determine association variable . Where chi-square test valid Yates correct Chi square test use . The result deem significant p-value less 0.05 . Qualitative data : The audio-taped information transcribe back translate Swahili English Swahili . A qualitative content analysis method describe Graneheim Lundman use analysis ( Graneheim 2004 ) . All texts read several time identify mean unit , , statement relate topic analysis . The mean unit condense . The condensed mean unit cod code categorize accord similarity difference content .</detailed_description>
