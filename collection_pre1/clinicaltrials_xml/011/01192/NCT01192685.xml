	<brief_summary>Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) demonstrate efficacy treatment major depression . No objective marker identify indicate patient likely respond TMS therapy . The goal present investigation determine whether electroencephalographic measure call cordance measure blood flow frontal brain , measure near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) serve predictor outcome TMS therapy depression . Subjects depression treat study 6 week TMS . Frontal brain blood flow measure use NIRS assess prior TMS therapy , repeatedly thereafter . EEG cordance also obtain follow similar schedule . Measures depression psychiatric disorder collect prior , 2 week completion TMS treatment . The correlation measure EEG NIRS measure determine see latter measure predictive improvement depression .</brief_summary>
