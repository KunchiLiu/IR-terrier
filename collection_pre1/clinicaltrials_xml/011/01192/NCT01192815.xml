	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Erlotinib hydrochloride may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Radiation therapy use high-energy x- ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together radiation therapy may effective treatment patient head neck cancer.PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give erlotinib hydrochloride together radiation therapy work treat patient stage III-IV squamous cell cancer head neck .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression combination EGFR inhibitor erlotinib radiation therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate , locoregional control rate , duration response , pattern failure , overall survival , toxicity quality life outcome combination erlotinib concurrent radiation therapy.II . To determine pharmacokinetic profile erlotinib . Additional analysis pharmacokinetic data patient receive daily erlotinib treatment via feed tube conduct . III . To determine effect treatment dose treatment biologic correlate tumor tissue and/or surround mucosa , EGFR expression phosphorylation status , serum marker angiogenic activity VEGF , sVEGFR-2 , sKIT , ICAM , PDGF , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ERBB2 gene amplification , DNA-sequencing EGFR ERBB2 gene DNA extract pretreatment biopsy material mutation screening , gene expression profile pre-treatment biopsy material identify predictor response treatment , apoptosis ( TUNEL assay ) , Ki67 ( nuclear proliferation antigen ) IV . To determine utility comprehensive geriatric assessment , predict tolerance treatment patient &gt; = 65 year include trial . OUTLINE : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally via gastrostomy tube daily week 1-9 2 year follow completion radiation therapy . Beginning day 1 week 2 , patient undergo radiation therapy daily , 5 time week , 5-7 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity.After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
