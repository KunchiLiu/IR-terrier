	<brief_title>Topical Lidocaine Cervix Intra-Cervical Prior Insertion Intrauterine Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There multiple study perform determine medication decrease pain associate intrauterine device insertion . These study test use misoprostol well NSAIDS determine decrease pain associate insertion . There also one small , poorly perform , study test use intracervical topical lidocaine prior IUD insertion . Misoprostol NSAIDS find non-efficacious decreasing pain . Topical lidocaine show effective , however , secondary poorly perform study , additional study need . This study determine topical lidocaine indeed decrease pain associate insertion Mirena® ( levonorgestrel intrauterine device ) . This double blind experimental study determine whether topical lidocaine gel apply cervix intra-cervically decrease pain associated insertion Mirena® ( levonorgestrel intrauterine device ) . Subjects randomize two group . One group receive 2 % lidocaine gel cervix intra-cervically . The group receive placebo , consist KY place cervix intra-cervically . After Mirena® ( levonorgestrel intrauterine device ) insert , subject 's pain assess use visual analog pain scale , response record information form . This pain scale assess time insertion , five minute insertion , ten minute insertion . The study research use topical lidocaine prior insertion IUD record pain scale time insertion . Additional score record five ten minute determine pain reduced time period . These time period choose order information record normal office visit . A visual analog pain scale scale include measure pain scale zero ten zero pain ten worst pain life . This pain scale scale range zero ten face depict amount pain involve score . Since different physician place intrauterine device , protocol perform insertion attempt make insertion uniform possible . A copy protocol include .</detailed_description>
