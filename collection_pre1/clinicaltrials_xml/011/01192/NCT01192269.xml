	<brief_summary>Various biological material investigate determine dietary fatty acid intake , plasma , erythrocytes , adipose tissue . The applied technique invasive sample method may limitations study involve infant young child . In 1985 group McMurchie suggest buccal cheek cell marker dietary fatty acid intake ; however fatty acid profile cheek cell widely use yet . In clinical intervention trial new method test . The study consist two consecutive part : A ) correlation study investigate relationship establish fatty acid marker ( red blood cell ( RBC ) , plasma ) newly propose marker ( cheek cell ) intervention B ) intervention study investigate time depend implementation steady state docosahexaenoic acid DHA plasma , RBC cheek cell . The participant receive 520 mg DHA daily period 30 day . Blood cheek cell sample collect prior study commencement regularly intervention . The propose study aim verify cheek cell analysis result non-invasive marker fatty acid profiling . This show correlation analysis fatty acid cheek cell , erythrocytes plasma phospholipid . Furthermore , time kinetics DHA incorporation cheek cell clarify cheek cell fatty acid consider short long term marker . The new non-invasive method expect extremely valuable non-invasive approach study fatty acid profile human , include infant young child . Therefore , great interest validate new method clinical trial .</brief_summary>
