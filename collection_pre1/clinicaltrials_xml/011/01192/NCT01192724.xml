	<brief_title>Additional Benefit Cilostazol Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Biolimus-eluting Stent Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous randomize trial show efficacy drug-eluting stent ( DES ) sirolimus-eluting stent ( CYPHERTM , Cordis , Warren , NJ , USA ) , paclitaxel-eluting stent ( TAXUSTM , BostonScientific , Natick , MA , USA ) , zotarolimus-eluting stent ( Endeavor , Medtronic , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) bare metal stent ( BMS ) reduce neointimal hyperplasia , late luminal loss , angiographic restenosis lead decreased target lesion revascularization.1-4 In addition , Among patient off-label indication , use DESs reduce rate repeat revascularization without increase risk death myocardial infarction , compare bare-metal stents.5 But , compare on-label use , off-label use DESs associate high rate adverse outcome death , myocardial infarction target vessel revascularization . Furthermore , stent thrombosis ( ST ) occur predominantly patient underwent off-label DES implantation.6 It know risk adverse cardiac event ST DES implantation relate stent length.7 Cilostazol potent phosphodiesterase III inhibitor prevent hydrolysis cAMP platelet vascular smooth muscle cell . The novel mechanism action cilostazol reduces number circulating , partially activate , precondition platelet , reduce surface expression adhesive molecule endothelial cell interact circulate platelet . The agent also directly inhibit platelet aggregation induce variety stimulus , include arachidonic acid , ADP , collagen , thrombin , high shear stress.8 In current guideline , 12-month duration dual antiplatelet therapy aspirin clopidogrel recommend DES implantation.9 But , recent meta-analyses show potential benefit cilostazol addition dual antiplatelet therapy reduce angiographic restenosis improve clinical outcome BMS DES implantation.10 , 11 Actually , additional cilostazol dual antiplatelet therapy show reduced restenosis late loss patient long coronary lesion diabetes multivessel coronary artery disease also show beneficial effect stent thrombosis DES implantation.12-14 Although study show difference bleed accord additional cilostazol dual antiplatelet therapy , rate early cessation cilostazol due adverse effect include headache , palpitation , skin rash hepatic dysfunction 15 % .12-14 Because relatively high side effect rate definitive duration addition cilostazol use , expect cilostazol short duration easily accept patient . Although almost study cilostazol stent implantation use 6- month duration cilostazol , one study show use cilostazol 3 month percutaneous transluminal coronary balloon angioplasty reduce restenosis revascularization , compare use aspirin.15 So , expect 3-month use additional cilostazol dual antiplatelet therapy reduce adverse outcome ST stent implantation without increase early cessation cilostazol . The BioMatrixTM stent system ( Biosensors Interventional Technologies Pte. , Ltd , Singapore ) consist stainless steel , quadrature-link design , balloon expandable S-StentTM , polylactic acid ( PLA ) polymer BiolimusA9® coating mount low-profile delivery catheter.16 , 17 It expect abluminal biodegradable coat BioMatrixTM stent lead target drug release , reduce systemic exposure early BMS-like endothelial coverage.18 The first-in-man , randomize control SEALTH I trial demonstrate high efficacy BioMatrixTM stent show low late lumen loss in-stent restenosis compare BMS , S-stent 6-month follow-up.19 In LEADERS trial , BioMatrixTM stent show similar efficacy safety compare sirolimus-eluting stent patient chronic stable coronary artery disease acute coronary syndromes.20 But significantly low uncovered malapposed strut detected optical coherence tomography study.21 This mean complete coverage strut expect low late ST BioMatrixTM stent implantation .</detailed_description>
