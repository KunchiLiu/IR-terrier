	<brief_title>Community Case Management Severe Pneumonia With Oral Amoxicillin Children 2-59 Months Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) one lead cause morbidity mortality child less five year age , responsible 2 million annual death age group . Of 10.8 million global child death estimate 2000 , 34 % South Asia 21 % total death attribute pneumonia . Inclusion death acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) associate cause would increase estimate two threefold . The ARI mortality burden principally constitute pneumonia . The median incidence pneumonia under-five child develop country estimate 0.29 episode ( interquartile range 0.21-0.71 ) per child year . It estimate develop country 150.7 million new pneumonia case occur year , 11-20 million ( 7-13 % ) severe enough require hospital admission . The region world high incidence pneumonia South South East Asia estimate 55.2 million episode occur child five year old . In developed world , estimate 14.7 million case occur year . Recent trend indicate Pakistan begin lag behind many regional country major indicator infant mortality rate ( IMR ) . Currently , Pakistan IMR 81/1000 live birth under-five mortality rate 103/1000 live birth . Annual number child death Pakistan estimate 565,000 , give Pakistan 4th rank India , Nigeria China . Of 560,000 under-five death report Pakistan 2001 , 19 % due pneumonia . At community level WHO guideline recommend trained health worker treat non-severe pneumonia oral antibiotic refer child severe pneumonia ( i.e . low chest wall indrawing [ LCI ] present ) local health facility treat injectable antibiotic ( oxygen , require ) . A series WHO sponsor randomize control trial subsequent meta-analysis result demonstrate guideline implement community-based health worker ( CHWs ) result 24-27 % reduction total child mortality 36-42 % reduction pneumonia mortality research settings.Pandey et al . show 28 % reduction total under-five mortality use locally train community health worker detect treat pneumonia . It previously show oral amoxicillin effective treatment ( WHO-defined ) severe pneumonia child . More recently multi-centre randomized control trial ( RCT ) conduct eight country show oral amoxicillin effective injectable penicillin treatment severe pneumonia hospital setting . For non-severe pneumonia two large multicentre RCTs Pakistan India show three-days ' treatment oral amoxicillin therapy equivalent five-days ' treatment . Non-adherence important risk factor treatment failure study also significantly relate long duration therapy . In addition , show study India Bangladesh/Indonesia three-days ' antibiotic therapy result low prevalence resistant organism 15 day initiation therapy , compare five-days ' therapy . The non-severe pneumonia severe pneumonia study mention hospital base clinical efficacy study ( several conduct member project team ) close monitor follow-up could assure . There need demonstrate effectiveness management strategy severe pneumonia community implement CHWs . If finding hospital-based RCTs replicate community setting may significant impact global policy community-based management ARI young child . Children severe pneumonia severe disease ( danger sign ) continue refer hospital treatment follow current WHO IMCI guideline . The use oral antibiotic treating severe pneumonia community level many potential benefit . This case management strategy , show effective , could : - simplify treatment severe pneumonia ; - minimize need referral hospitalization ; - decrease treatment administration cost ; - reduce transport , food lose income cost family ; - reduce pressure already overburdened hospital ; - reduce risk needle-associated complication needle-borne infection ; - reduce risk nosocomial infection hospital stay . LHWs Pakistan well place community , Hala district comprise mainstay primary health care system . LHWs train standard ARI case management base WHO 's guideline program active health education component . Management pneumonia standard case management , part IMCI - approach develop WHO UNICEF - principal strategy reduce ARI mortality.LHWs employ IMCI approach classify severity respiratory infection observe child key sign pneumonia : chest in-drawing fast breathing . With help refresher course recently develop LHW program - base IMCI algorithm - LHWs additionally train identify manage severe pneumonia community level improve skill promotion care-seeking ANA.While hop measure markedly reduce overall childhood mortality pneumonia related mortality community , study propose measure effect enhance case management ANA LHWs reduce clinical treatment failure rate among child 2-59 month age . DEFINITION OF TREATMENT FAILURE Suspected treatment failure determine LHW subsequent home visit child enrol . The LHW immediately contact Lady Health Worker Supervisor ( LHS ) independently confirm case failure . The provision clinical care ( i.e . arrange referral ) delay delay identification suspect treatment failure confirmation LHS . Clinical Treatment Failure day 5 child 2-59 month define : 1 . Clinical deterioration day 5 death occur within 14 day enrollment , prior change primary antibiotic therapy . 2 . Persistence fever ( &gt; or=100 F ) low chest indrawing day 3 ( 48 hour initiation therapy ) 3 . Fever ( &gt; or=100 F ) low chest indrawing appearance danger sign day 6 4 . Secondary treatment failure relapse define appearance danger sign lower chest indrawing fast breathing ( &gt; or= 50 breaths/min ) day 7 14 . Case management Control Arm : The standard care train LHWs control cluster current curriculum training workshop . All LHWs control cluster receive refresher management ARI LHW supervisor . They continue treat non-severe pneumonia case ARI oral co-trimoxazole . Skills recognition severe pneumonia reinforce refresher course LHW instruct continue evaluate refer case Rural Health Center ( RHC ) district general hospital admission treatment ( injectable chloramphenicol ampicillin ) per current policy . Patients refuse go health facility treatment ( either public private ) , offer enhance home treatment amoxicillin provide oral co-trimoxazole per GoP policy . These child include final analysis treatment failure , record overall epidemiological data area . Oral cotrimoxazole provide free cost per GOP policy . Any compensation research related injury include hospitalization transportation health clinic borne study . Subjects develop sign penicillin allergy treat antihistamine cost transport local health facility cost project . Case management Intervention Arm : LHWs intervention cluster specific train enhance ability evaluate treat ARI . This include post-training evaluation ability ass classify non-severe severe pneumonia manage non-severe pneumonia . This consist improved training module LHWs ( respiratory care component ) amend treatment plan severe pneumonia oral amoxicillin . The enhanced respiratory training module LHWs include prompt recognition referral study treatment failure ( include severe disease ) day 3 , base objective criterion fever low chest indrawing . In intervention arm LHWs diagnose severe pneumonia refer patient near facility ( RHC admit facility district general hospital ) , instead offer treatment oral amoxicillin ( 90 mg/kg/day divide BID ) home 5 day close follow-up . Additionally , LHWs continue treat non-severe pneumonia entirely community 3 day course oral amoxicillin per standard practice . The study drug ( oral amoxicillin ) provide free cost per GOP policy . Any compensation research related injury include hospitalization transportation health clinic borne study . For severe pneumonia , oral amoxicillin provide suspension total dose 90 mg/kg per day 5 day Patients vomit within half hour oral treatment receive repeat dose amoxicillin . This attempt three time 30 minute . If patient fails three attempt consider treatment failure . Sample Size Calculation - Primary Objective The investigator calculate sample size allow u test follow null hypothesis : Null hypothesis : The proportion child fail treatment treatment group great proportion fail control group . The method Hayes Bennett21 , employ follow equation , use calculate number cluster . The sample size calculation repeat use PASS software use procedure cluster randomize equivalency trial Because number cluster fix , investigator calculate sample size trial solve number participant require give set assumption . c =2 + ( Zα/2 + Zβ ) 2 * [ π0* ( 1-π0 ) /n +π1* ( 1-π1 ) /n+k2* ( π02+π12 ) ] / ( π0-π1 ) 2 π0 = prop int , π1=prop control , n=number per cluster , k=coefficient variation Below investigator detail assumption use sample size calculation provide justification assumption : 1 . Failure proportion control group : The investigator anticipate proportion child 2-59 month fail standard care therapy day 6 15 % . This base 15 % failure proportion find APPIS I trial . ( 11 ) A consensus among investigator determine failure proportion lower trial definition failure APPIS I overly conservative . 2 . Failure proportion intervention group : The investigator anticipate proportion child fail therapy day 6 intervention arm 10 % . The null hypothesis proportion child 2-59 month fail treatment intervention group great proportion fail control group . Based consensus investigator , difference 5 % less observed treatment failure group , two treatment consider equivalent . This equivalence consider clinically equivalent . 3 . Number cluster : The investigator base sample size determination total 18 available cluster ( 9 per arm ) . 4 . Power : The investigator use power 0.9 , set Type II error level 0.1 , 10 % chance able detect difference treatment failure truly exist . This base consensus among investigator . Power set high equivalency trial , emphasis place make sure lack difference base underpowered study . 5 . Alpha : Based consensus principal investigator , null hypothesis reject base one-sided test ( study focus whether intervention equivalent control ) , p=0.05 level significance . 6 . Coefficient variation ( k ) : Inherent correlation observation homogeneous cluster account cluster-randomized trial coefficient variation . The investigator use estimate 0.20 study . Hayes Bennett21 note k typically le 0.25 health study . In case outcome proportion child fail treatment investigator therefore assume variation failure rate cluster exhibit great variation . A coefficient variation 0.2 would equivalent cluster control arm failure rate 0.06 0.18 . Based assumption , investigator conclude need enroll 290 case severe pneumonia per cluster among 9 cluster per arm ( total 18 cluster ) two year , total 5,233 case severe pneumonia .</detailed_description>
