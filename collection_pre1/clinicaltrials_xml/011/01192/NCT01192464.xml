	<brief_summary>Patients type lymph gland cancer call non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin 's Lymphoma . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . Antibodies proteins protect body disease cause germ toxic substance . They work bind germ substance , stop grow cause bad effect . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infected germ . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer : show promise , strong enough cure patient . We hope work well together . We find previous research put new gene T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . We want see attach new gene T cell help good job recognize kill lymphoma cell . The new gene put T cell make antibody call anti-CD30 . This antibody stick lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD30 . Anti-CD30 antibody use treat people lymphoma , strong enough cure patient . For study , anti-CD30 antibody change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These chimeric receptor-T cell seem kill tumor , n't last long chance fight cancer unknown . We find T cell also train recognize virus cause infectious mononucleosis stay blood stream many year . These call EBV specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes . By join anti-CD30 antibody EBV CTLs , believe also able make cell last long time body recognize kill lymphoma cell . We call final cell CD30 chimeric receptor EBV CTLs . There also evidence patient whose tumor EBV negative also benefit study treatment tumor express CD30 . If successful , hope new cell may able work longer target kill lymphoma cell . However , know yet .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EBV CTLs Expressing CD30 Chimeric Receptors For CD 30+ Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Earlier , patient give u blood make CD30 chimeric-EBV CTLs lab . These cell grow frozen patient . To get CD30 antibody attach surface T cell , insert antibody gene T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . Because patient receive cell new gene follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . When patient enrol study , assign one follow dose level CD30 chimeric receptor-EBV CTLs . - 2×10^7 cells/m2 - 5x10^7 cells/m2 - 1×10^8 cells/m2 The dose level cell receive base medical determination best , instead dose base order patient enrolls study relative participant . Subjects enrol earlier study receive low dose cell enrol later study . The risk harm discomfort study treatment may bear relationship dose level . The potential direct benefit , , may also vary dose level . To enroll study need recover toxic effect previous chemotherapy least one week receive investigational agent . Patients receive tumor vaccine within previous six week .</detailed_description>

Patient/guardian give copy inform consent . TREAMENT Patients must meet following eligibility criterion include treatment : Diagnosis CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL During dose escalation phase : adult patient ( age 18 old ) active disease fail standard therapy After dose escalation : patient ( child adult ) relapse CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL newly diagnose patient unable receive complete standard therapy OR diagnosis relapsed/refractory CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL treatment plan include high dose therapy autologous stem cell transplantation . CD30 positive tumor EBV seropositivity . Recovered acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy least one week 30 day prior chemotherapy enter study . Bilirubin 1.5 time less upper limit normal . AST 3 time less upper limit normal . Serum creatinine 1.5 time less upper limit normal . Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air Karnofsky Lansky score &gt; 60 % .
