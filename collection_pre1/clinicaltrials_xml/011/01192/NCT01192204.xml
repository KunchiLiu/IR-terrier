	<brief_summary>This multicenter placebo-controlled clinical trial ass effect topically apply gel precancerous oral epithelial lesion . A total 41 participant enrolled trial , 22 enrol Ohio State . [ The remain 19 participant enrol University North Carolina ( 9 participant ) University Louisville ( 8 participant ) ] . At three institution , half participant randomly assign 10 % FBR gel ( 0.5 gm four time daily 3 month ) , half enter placebo control arm . All trial participant pretreatment ( include lesional perilesional tissue ) biopsy take excisional biopsy 3 month treatment . As pretreatment index compare post treatment effect patient , patient serve internal control . Pretreatment lesional biopsy obtain establish pretreatment diagnosis provide pretreatment baseline experimental parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Forty one ( 41 ) patient microscopically confirm premalignant oral epithelial disease ( epithelial dysplasia ) enrol trial three clinical center , i.e . Ohio State University , University North Carolina Chapel Hill University Louisville . At three institution , half participant randomly assign 10 % FBR gel ( 0.5 gm four time daily 3 month ) , half enter placebo control arm . In accordance establish standard care , participant need biopsy take suspicious oral lesion establish diagnosis ( non research ) . Trial participant three total biopsy . Pretreatment biopsy entail : 1 ) perilesional tissue single saliva sample FBR metabolic profile study ( tissue saliva obtain 15 minute single 0.5 gm application 10 % FBR gel metabolic profiling . Gel application nonlesional biopsy obtain incisional biopsy lesional tissue ) , 2 ) hemisection lesional tissue establish diagnosis provide pretreatment baseline experimental parameter . While pretreatment biopsy include removal perilesional lesional tissue , one surgical wind perilesional tissue contiguous lesional tissue . A final excisional biopsy treatment site include remain residual lesional tissue ( excision oral dysplastic lesion consistent current standard care ) obtain 3 month treatment . The experimental design permit patient serve internal control . Briefly , follow parameter monitor participant ( comparison make relative patient-matched pretreatment posttreatment biopsy ) : 1 ) light microscopic diagnosis , 2 ) clinical appearance lesional size , 3 ) microarray gene expression analysis , 4 ) microvascular density superficial connective tissue , 5 ) LOH indices loci associate tumor suppressor gene , 6 ) intraepithelial level COX-2 iNOS protein ( image analysis quantify immunohistochemistry ) , 7 ) comparison FBR metabolic profile relative extent chemopreventive efficacy note .</detailed_description>
