	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma second common solid tumor see child , cause approximately 15 % childhood cancer death year . Patients high-risk disease require treatment combination chemotherapy , surgery , radiation , stem cell transplant ; however , many disease come back within 3 year . Due high rate relapse , study do investigate experimental treatment option child whose disease return . This clinical trial patient neuroblastoma either come back treatment never go away first place . A series immunization administer use tumor vaccine add low-dose chemotherapy take mouth daily basis . The hope vaccine cause immune system recognize kill type neuroblastoma tumor . Additionally , immunization combine daily low dose chemotherapy . Daily low-dose chemotherapy , also know metronomic chemotherapy , work attack blood vessel allow tumor grow . Using metronomic dos drug call cytoxan also decrease T regulatory cell , specific type cell tumor use hide immune system . The purpose study test safety anti-tumor effect tumor cell vaccination plus low dose , metronomic chemotherapy treat patient relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Tumor Cell Vaccination With Oral Metronomic Cytoxan Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>WHAT IS THE OVERALL TREATMENT PLAN AND HOW MANY VACCINATIONS WILL THE PATIENT RECEIVE ? There several injection vaccine schedule . The first injection give 3 day start oral cytoxan . The 2nd 4th injection give approximately every 14 day previous vaccine . During time , patient take oral cytoxan day except day 4 day follow vaccine . Two 3 week 4th vaccine , patient complete evaluation disease . If scans lab test show patient serious side-effects , eligible receive 4 additional vaccination give 3 week interval . The disease re-evaluated vaccine number 6 8 . If patient able complete entire study , receive total 8 vaccination last dose oral cytoxan 1 month 8th vaccination . Total time duration participate study 15 year ( treatment portion within year 1 follow year 2-15 ) . Neuroblastoma vaccination give like many vaccine . They give subcutaneously . The injection 1/10th teaspoon . MEDICAL TESTS BEFORE STARTING TREATMENT : Before start low dose chemotherapy plus oral cytoxan , patient receive series standard medical test : - Physical exam - Blood test measure blood cell , blood salt , kidney liver function - Measurements disease ( CT MRI primary tumor site location tumor spread ; MIBG Bone scan ; Chest X-ray CT chest ; bone marrow study patient know bone marrow disease ) - Baseline test immune function - Pregnancy test perform female child bear age MEDICAL TESTS DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT : Prior vaccine dose , patient receive : - Physical exam - Blood test measure blood cell , blood salt , kidney liver function - Measurements disease ( CT MRI primary tumor site location tumor spread ; MIBG Bone scan ; Chest X-ray CT chest ; bone marrow study know bone marrow disease ) 4th , 6th 8th vaccine . - Testing immune function - Pregnancy test perform female child bear age prior 5th vaccine To learn way vaccine stimulate immune cell , collect blood prior vaccination schedule time point 3 month last vaccine treatment . The total amount blood collect day 2 ounce , depend upon weight . This volume consider safe teen adult , may decrease patient anemic . On day patient receives vaccine , blood take cell give .</detailed_description>
