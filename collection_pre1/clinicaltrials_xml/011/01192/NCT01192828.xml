	<brief_title>Oxidative Stress Markers In Inherited Homocystinuria And The Impact Of Taurine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystathionine beta-synthase deficient homocystinuria ( CBSDH ) inherit disease result elevation substance call homocysteine ( Hcy ) blood urine . Individuals disorder high risk develop blood clot cause stroke life-threatening problem . In addition , individual bone joint tissue abnormality . Current treatment extremely strict diet medication ( betaine ) difficult follow , often fail . Development additional treatment strategy limit lack knowledge understand disease work . Hence , need good understand cause blood clot bone joint tissue abnormality . New data suggest oxidative stress inflammation play central role animal disease . Limited data human disease support well . Further , data animal disease suggest taurine , natural body substance food product , low patient , mitigates effect . This study design follow-up data . The purpose study increase understand disease process disorder , see pilot study short-term supplementation taurine effective intervention . The aim study : 1. see substance ( marker ) associate oxidative stress inflammation increase individual CBSDH 2. see level marker relate level homocysteine 3. see level marker decrease short-term taurine supplementation 4. see bood vessel platelet ( small substance blood help blood clot ) work individual CBSDH , ability work related level marker oxidative stress inflammation , taurine supplementation improve work 5. see alteration bone strength relate level marker inflammation . The hypothesis investigate follow : - Biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation increase individual CBSDH - The degree elevation biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation relative degree elevation homocysteine , main accumulate substance disease . - Treatment taurine mitigate elevation biomarkers oxidative stress inflammation . - Endothelial function ( blood vessel function ) abnormal individual CBSDH even receive standard therapy improve taurine supplementation . - Chronic platelet aggregation , variable finding individual CBSDH , mitigate taurine supplementation . - Decreased bone mineral density relate increase inflammatory marker CBSDH . In addition , baseline pharmacokinetics ( much taurine blood ) oral pharmacologic dos taurine develop .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . A confirmed biochemical , molecular , enzymatic diagnosis classic homocystinuria due cystathionine betasynthase deficiency ( OMIM 236200 ) 2 . And fully responsive therapy ( eg , total homocysteine ( tHcy ) level 50 Âµmol/L therapy include B6 therapy ) 3 . Be 8 year old less 50 year . The first four patient adult ( age 1850 year ) 4 . Be able willing provide inform consent 1 . Pregnancy : Females pregnant lactate exclude study influence pregnancy marker know safety taurine supplementation pregnancy . 2 . Continued antioxidant intake : 1 . Individuals currently take taurine , counter energy drink contain taurine high dose antioxidant unwilling discontinue study period ( include 2 week wash period ) exclude intake likely impact laboratory result . 2 . Individuals take Vitamin C prescribe treatment homocystinuria exclude antioxidant therapy may impact antioxidant inflammation marker . ( As Vitamin C standard care disease anticipate minimal impact recruitment . ) 3 . Individuals currently take platelet aggregation inhibitor salicylate self prescribed basis unwilling discontinue study period ( include washout period least two week prior study ) exclude salicylate intake impact platelet study result . Individuals take salicylate ( platelet aggregation inhibitor ) prescribe therapy homocystinuria health issue ask stop medication . They participate study , exclude platelet study . 3 . Medication interaction : Individuals unable unwilling abstain use cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor ( Viagra ) study period exclude nitroglycerininduced flowmediated dilatation study accordance know labeling contraindication . 4 . Inflammatory status : 1 . Individuals significant chronic illness mark inflammatory component exclude study illness impact inflammatory marker . 2 . Patients acute illness , may impact inflammatory biomarkers , postpone study entry acute illness resolve . Entry study later day offer . 5 . Recent cardiovascular event . Cardiovascular event ( stroke , myocardial infarct , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolus , thrombosis , uncontrolled hypertension ) may interfere platelet function study various mediator first month event . Patients event within last 6 month exclude . 6 . Hypertriglyceridemia . Individuals triglyceride level 300 mg/dl exclude study . 7 . Informed consent : Individuals unwilling unable consent , case minor unwilling unable assent exclude due lack ability ensure informed consent . 8 . Study compliance integrity : Individual anticipate inability comply study procedures requirement exclude .</criteria>
