	<detailed_description>Treatment novel radiotherapeutic technology could increase local control adenoid cystic carcinoma head neck . Especially combined treatment intensity-modulated radiation therapy heavy ion ( C12 ) boost primary tumor previous tumor bed could establish treatment choice disease . Unfortunately , therapeutic result treatment adenoid cystic carcinoma still hamper occurrence distant metastasis ( predominantly lung ) , though progress comparatively slowly , still limit patient 's life expectancy . Most adenoid cystic carcinoma ( &gt; 80 % ) though , exhibit over-expression EGFR receptor hence provide approach systemic treatment . In prospective phase II trial , application EGFR antibody cetuximab evaluate combination establish treatment intensity-modulated radiation therapy plus C12 heavy ion boost . The trial aim evaluation toxicity feasibility combine treatment , primary endpoint , well local control disease-free survival secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
