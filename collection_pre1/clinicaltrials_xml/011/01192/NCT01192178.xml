	<detailed_description>Study ADA113872 ass ability ADVAIR™ DISKUS™ 100/50 mcg , comparison FLOVENT™ DISKUS™ 100 mcg , reduce worsen asthma associate viral respiratory infection fall season pediatric population . A number descriptive measure use assess reduction worsen asthma . These include number exacerbation , duration severity asthma symptom 7 day follow report moderate upper respiratory tract symptom worsen asthma , number rescue-free day , rate asthma control day . Subjects identify start April 2010 evaluate whether meet eligibility criterion . If subject identify potential candidate study request return clinic August 2 , 2010 August 20 , 2010 . Subjects meet inclusion none exclusion criterion enter study . All subject must randomize August 20th , 2010 . Subjects males female age 4 11 year ( randomization date ) document diagnosis asthma require ICS monotherapy controller medication low dose ICS part combination controller medication . In order subject moderate dose ICS low dose ICS + LABA combination therapy eligible inclusion study asthma must control 3 month prior randomization must candidate step-down therapy outline current asthma management guideline . All subject must history one exacerbations previous respiratory viral season require use outpatient oral/parenteral corticosteroid urgent care , Emergency Department visit hospitalization , asthma require use oral/parenteral corticosteroid . Subjects receive study medication Randomization visit instruct keep electronic daily record AM PEF , asthma symptom , night-time awakening due asthma , rescue use , upper respiratory tract infection symptom . During double-blind treatment period electronic Diary ( eDiary ) alert subject parent/legal guardian data impute eDiary indicates presence upper respiratory symptom moderate severe severity subject reach criterion worsen asthma . Upon receipt either alert , subject parent/legal guardian instruct call clinic . The clinic instruct subject ( parent/legal guardian ) provide mucus sample assessment viral respiratory infection . Mucus sample viral respiratory assessment collect subject 7 day period . During randomization visit subject receive training home collection mucus sample . Throughout study subject instructed rate daily upper respiratory symptom . Upper respiratory tract symptom include : runny nose , sneeze , nasal congestion , sore throat . Subjects instructed select rating follow list best describes aggregate upper respiratory symptom previous 24 hour . This study evaluate effect ADVAIR™ DISKUS™ 100/50 mcg FLOVENT™ DISKUS™ 100 mcg clinical parameter index airway inflammation associate viral respiratory tract infection pediatric asthmatic subject . Safety assess monitor adverse event .</detailed_description>
