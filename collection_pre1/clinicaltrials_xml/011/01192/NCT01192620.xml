	<brief_title>Pediatric Appendicitis Pathway Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : Overview : This study consent enroll prospective cohort well incorporate retrospective chart review base HIPAA waiver informed consent . The prospective portion study pediatric patient age 3-18 evaluated acute appendicitis OHSU/Doernbecher ED . Patients prospectively consent enrolled CRISP program . The treat physician document specific clinical predictor acute appendicitis use paper form . These criterion combine routine laboratory measurement identify patient high low risk acute appendicitis base two publish validate score system . High risk patient directly admit pediatric surgery service . Low risk patient observe ED discharge home close outpatient follow-up base ED attend physician 's judgment . Low risk patient routinely consult pediatric surgery unless discretion ED attending . Patients intermediate risk base score system continue evaluation ED discretion attend physician . Patients definitively diagnose acute appendicitis operative finding contact telephone two week train research assistant ass miss outcome , follow method use Schneider et al . another validation study prediction rule pediatric appendicitis . As clinical protocol introduce OHSU/Doernbecher ED independently research study , patient participate likely also treat accord similar algorithm . The difference non-participating patient data record except part regular clinical record , contact follow-up . Outcomes interest prospective portion study include sensitivity specificity score system identify acute appendicitis , well accuracy various diagnostic element include history , exam , laboratory study , image . In order ass effect protocol hospital-level outcome , retrospective chart review study also conduct compare year implementation year . These patient retrospectively enrol base HIPAA waiver informed consent . Patients consent include prospective portion study also include retrospective analysis . Outcomes interest include emergency department length stay , time arrival inpatient bed surgery , time specialty pediatric surgery consultation , use diagnostic imaging , admission rate . Study Subjects : We prospectively enroll consecutive sample patient age 3 18 present OHSU ED suspicion appendicitis hour study staff available . The high risk ( Alvarado ) criterion validate age group . Clinical Research Investigative Study Program ( CRISP ) volunteer duty emergency department hour 7 11 pm identify possible patient base suggestive chief complaint ( e.g abdominal pain , vomiting , etc ) approach attend physician whether patient evaluate possible appendicitis . If , approach family , consent participation , prospectively collect data paper form ( see data collection section ) . Patients transfer another facility ED include , include prior diagnostic imaging . Patients symptoms great seven day exclude . For portion study , patient enrol retrospectively base screen eligible chart EPIC . Screening base chief complaint diagnosis EPIC include abdominal pain , vomiting , appendicitis etc . Charts identify initial screening review trained physician include judge concern part attend physician appendicitis . Their information enter electronic database ( see ) . Patients enter retrospective portion study regardless whether enrol prospective section . Number Study Subjects : Based project admission rate 500 patient per year suspect appendicitis , admission rate 50 % , expect 1000 eligible patient see OHSU emergency department annually . As CRISP volunteer present 16 hour per day , expectation 75 % patient volume present hour , base 50 % enrollment eligible patient , expect prospectively enroll 375 patient one year . Based prevalence appendicitis 30 % specificity high risk criterion 78.8 % previous study evaluate high risk criterion , project sample size yield confidence interval specificity +/- 4.5 % . For low-risk criterion 's previously demonstrate sensitivity 98 % , sample size yield confidence interval sensitivity less +/- 4 % . The portion study enroll patient full year implementation avoid seasonal variation especially inherent teach hospital . Expected enrollment therefore 2000 patient . Prevalence rate previous study range 10 92 % depend inclusion criterion . Those study high prevalence rate include patient receive underwent surgery suspect appendicitis . In study broad inclusion criterion similar , ( e.g . ED evaluation acute abdominal pain , surgical evaluation possible appendicitis ) , prevalence range 10 61 % . Special Patient Populations : Patients select entry criterion describe . No special group vulnerable population specifically choose inclusion , may include within general study population . There specific exclusion basis gender ethnic group . Consent form translate Spanish ViaLanguage . Spanish speaking parent limited English proficiency consent professional in-person telephone translator . Other limited English proficiency parent exclude . Consent : For prospective portion study , eligible parent consent enrollment CRISP volunteer use attached consent form . Children age 7-18 asked assent use attached form . For retrospective portion , patient enrol base HIPAA waiver informed consent , data come clinical record . Study Procedure : Patients enrol prospective cohort portion study treat accord clinical pathway ( see attach ) . This protocol develop collaboration department emergency medicine pediatric surgery . The pathway standardize routine treatment pediatric patient evaluate appendicitis ( e.g . lab ordering , pain medication , nurse assessment ) well triages patient evaluation base validate low high risk score system include historical , physical exam , laboratory element . Deviation pathway allow discretion treat physician . As pathway implement departmental protocol ( similar many clinical pathway already use emergency department ) independent study , non-enrolled patient also treat accord discretion treat physician . The difference treatment enrol non-enrolled patient data record independently patient 's clinical record enrol study , enrol patient receive telephone follow-up two week discharge need determine outcome . The pathway form tabulate low high risk clinical laboratory criterion available clinician reference enrol non-enrolled patient , retain visit participate study . The retrospective portion study base EPIC chart review patient evaluate appendicitis twelve month period implementation study . Data Collection Analysis : Both retrospective prospective portion study collect follow data : Patient demographic include age gender . Duration symptom . Visit characteristic include referral clinic , inter-hospital transfer , presentation directly OHSU ED . Studies perform within 72 hour emergency department arrival : CT scan abdominal/pelvic ultrasound , complete blood count , differential , urinalysis , urine pregnancy test , metabolic panel , liver function test , lipase . Time variable : time emergency department room assignment , time emergency department disposition , time incision patient undergoing surgery . Disposition classify home , ED observation ( define ED stay &gt; 8 hour ) , surgery ( include admission inpatient operation within 4 hour ) , inpatient observation ( operation within 4 hour admission ) . Patients see another facility condition within 72 hour come OHSU relevant part medical record send patient , fax , electronic medical record ( Kaiser HealthConnect PACS image system ) . If record send , CRISP volunteer obtain write permission HIPAA release information ( see attach ) . This immediately faxed refer facility vital information available treat physician patient 's care emergency department well study purpose . For prospective portion study , consent patient also specific sign symptom require calculation two score document form ED attend physician ( see attach ) . This form also ask physician rate level clinical suspicion appendicitis prior complete score system . In prospective study , sensitivity specificity high low risk criterion calculate diagnose appendicitis . Imaging study outcome base interpretation attend radiologist clinical chart . These interpretation classify positive , negative , indeterminate physician blind final diagnosis . Data analyze include exclude patient image perform transfer , may alter use pathway . Subjects prospective portion trial surgically confirm diagnosis appendicitis make hospitalization contact phone research assistant ( medical student physician ) . The primary outcome interest whether patient subsequently diagnose appendicitis . Other data include subsequent medical visit diagnostic study , time cessation symptom , alternative diagnosis make . Time outcomes rate image laboratory utilization compare period implementation protocol appropriate regression model incorporate variable consider importance a-priori include age , gender , pediatric ED census time arrival six hour block . Rates location pediatric surgery consultation ( ED versus inpatient ) also record . Key outcomes also analyze interrupted-time-series fashion , look outcome month month order track immediate versus sustain effect protocol implementation . Paper data collection form transcribe Microsoft Access database keep secure server OHSU . Analysis conduct use STATA 11 . Data analysis perform Oregon Health Sciences University Department Emergency Medicine . No data share outside OHSU . Ethical Considerations : Once record enter Microsoft Access database keep secure server limit access OHSU , record de-identified prior analysis . The date visit change include month date birth convert age order identifiable . With safeguard , confident adequately protect patient confidentiality . Risks : The risk participation study clinical decision rule could result treatment inferior would occur without treatment pathway . However , pathway implement emergency department care standard , patient would likely treat accord whether participate study . The risk participation loss privacy confidential data compromise . As risk minimal , interim analysis data safety monitoring plan unnecessary . Data Safety Monitoring Plan : Safety monitor investigator department emergency medicine continuous quality assurance ( CQI ) process . The CQI process automatically flags return emergency department within 48 hour discharge forward review monthly CQI committee . Cases miss appendicitis , diagnose require specific treatment hospitalization identify two-week telephone follow review CQI committee well investigator division chief pediatric emergency medicine ( Dr. Spiro ) . Cases patient admitted emergency department observation subsequently admit hospital identify research assistant review investigator .</detailed_description>
