	<brief_title>Assessing Infectious Risk Visceral Closure Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acceptance advancement natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) force investigator challenge many firmly accept surgical practice . The obvious one : violating remote hollow viscous uninvolved desired surgical intervention . This course bring question ( 1 ) `` How much peritoneal contamination tolerate without raise infection risk ? '' ( 2 ) `` How one repair intend visceral injury ? '' This study intend bring light do animal model , , translate important human arena . In study , patient undergo elective colectomy investigate quantify amount peritoneal contamination tolerate despite rare abscess formation occur . Subject undergo peritoneal washing colonic resection measure bacterial load spill . This data would beneficial support patient undergo NOTES procedure able tolerate definite quantity bacterial contaminate . Furthermore , observe exact value peritoneal contamination present may certain level infectious complication likely occur . This may provide insight NOTES patient may benefit post-operatively prophylactic course antibiotic therapy response higher tolerable intra-peritoneal bacterial load . The component study challenge investigator examine closure device animal model . Many researcher , include author protocol , utilized bursting pressure objective test ass integrity complete closure . Current surgical practice use insufflation endoscope even bulb syringe test leak colonic anastomosis . We intend measure pressure achieve clinical setting determine burst pressure require assess NOTES closure eliminate likely unsupported value place high bursting pressure commonly quote NOTES closure study .</detailed_description>
