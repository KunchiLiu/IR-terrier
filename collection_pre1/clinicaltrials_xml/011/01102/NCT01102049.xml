	<brief_summary>Many population study include food questionnaire ( record normal food intake food intake study day ) . This necessary , diet important lifestyle factor , although food questionnaire time-consuming expensive . Moreover , mis-reporting common problem . We therefore seek tool validate food protocol . The hypothesis find biochemical marker animal protein , fruit intake grape consumption urinary metabolic profile specific food consumption . Furthermore want specify biomarkers different animal protein source , fish beef .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Volunteers ask follow diet plan whole course study . Every newly introduce food ( study dinner day 2-5 ) cause change biochemical marker excretion urine . To monitor kinetics biomarker excretion necessary collect urine several time day ; ask volunteer collect first morning urine , lunch , dinner go bed . Urine sample start first morning urine day 1 end first morning urine day 7 . As test food , propose fruit salad ( apple , grape , orange grapefruit ) day 2 , fish day 3 , grape day 4 , beef day 5 fish lunch day 6 . From day 0 ( run-in day ) day 6 basic diet always bread cheese breakfast , coffee morning , ham sandwich lunch , pasta tomato sauce dinner . As beverage water allow ( although wine permit day 4 subject wish protocol requirement ) . The test food consume addition . All urine sample analyse use high resolution NMR spectroscopy mass spectrometry . Mathematical data analysis well visual examination NMR spectrum also carry identify new food biomarkers .</detailed_description>
