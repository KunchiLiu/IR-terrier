	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether take eszopiclone ( Lunesta ) change breathe effort require briefly wake people obstructive sleep apnea sleep ( respiratory arousal threshold ) . We would like see take eszopiclone reduce severity obstructive sleep apnea people ( low respiratory arousal threshold ; i.e . wake easily respiratory stimulus ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea exceedingly common disease major neurocognitive cardiovascular consequence . The current primary treatment e.g . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) effective poorly tolerate many patient particularly mild-moderate disease . Secondary treatment oral appliance advance mandible surgical procedure enlarge airway commonly appeal patient . However , approach modest success reduce apnea frequency acceptable level . Thus , find tolerable effective therapy sleep apnea remain important objective . The cause sleep apnea vary patient . Targeted therapy accord underlying cause sleep apnea individual patient likely effective . However , current therapeutic option sleep apnea quite limited . The purpose physiological research study determine take eszopiclone ( Lunesta ) change breathe effort require briefly wake people obstructive sleep apnea sleep ( arousal threshold ) administration sedative medication eszopiclone ( Lunesta ) certain sleep apnea patient ( low arousal threshold ie wake easily ) would beneficial .</detailed_description>
