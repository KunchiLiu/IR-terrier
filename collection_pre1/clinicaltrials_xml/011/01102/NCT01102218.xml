	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient increase level inflammation oxidative stress , turn contribute anemia cardiovascular disease . Pentoxifylline know anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property , show promise improve treatment patient anemia . This study examine use pentoxifylline treatment anemia chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study Pentoxifylline Treatment Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment anemia renal failure revolutionize use erythropoietin ESAs ( erythropoiesis-stimulating agent ) . Concerns ESA use include substantial number End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) patient ESA-resistant anemia , grow body evidence potential negative effect high dos ESA use , include increased mortality increase rate tumor growth cancer patient . There couple small study literature examine effect pentoxifylline anemia patient renal failure . The result limit small number patient . There clearly need large , prospective , clinical trial pentoxifylline ESRD patient , limited ESA-resistant anemia . This would first prospective , randomize clinical trial size study pentoxifylline treatment anemia chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
