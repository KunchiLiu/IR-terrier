	<brief_title>Pyrimethamine Treatment Late-Onset GM2-gangliosidosis ( Tay-Sachs Sandhoff Disease )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients late-onset Tay-Sachs Sandhoff disease give increase dos Pyr , exceed dos use treat malaria , 5-month period . We follow effect treatment level Hex A enzyme activity white blood cell , consider reflection likely enzyme activity brain . We also follow lysosomal enzyme activity determine effect specific Hex A . Furthermore , examine effect treatment level GM2-ganglioside white blood cell . On basis study do cultured skin cell , expect treatment Pyr increase level Hex A decrease accumulation GM2-ganglioside white blood cell .</detailed_description>
