	<brief_title>Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision Via Enteral Route Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There well know well describe relationship malnutrition , immune dysfunction , infection . Critically ill patient often hypermetabolic rapidly become nutritionally compromised . Repeated effort past year significantly improve amount calorie deliver via enteral route . Historically , feed protocol use guide delivery enteral nutrition ( EN ) frequently utilize conservative , reactionary approach optimize nutrition . We propose new approach protocolizes aggressive approach provide EN shift paradigm reactionary proactive follow de-escalation nutrition therapy need . The key component new protocol following : 1 ) Starting feed target rate base increase evidence patient tolerate start nutrition high rate delivery slow start ups necessary . For patient hemodynamically stable , propose shift hourly rate target goal 24 hour volume goal give nurse guidance make volume interruption non-gastrointestinal reason . This 'volume-based ' goal represent significant shift practice traditional hourly rate goal nurse increase hourly rate depend many hour leave day ensure patient receives 24 hour volume within day . 2 ) For patient deem unsuitable high volume intragastric feed , provide option initiate 'trophic feed ' low volume concentrate feeding solution . By 'trophic ' , mean minimal volume EN design maintain gastrointestinal structure function , design meet patient caloric protein need . When deem suitable , trophic feed advance full feed . 3 ) Rather wait protein debt accumulate inadequate delivery EN , protein supplement prescribe initiation EN discontinue EN well tolerate . 4 ) We propose start motility agent time EN start re-evaluation day follow see necessary raise gastric residual volume threshold 200 250 ml . It show one randomize trial feed protocol start motility agent empirically time initiation feed use high threshold critical gastric residual volume ( 250 ml ) improve nutritional adequacy . Since bedside nurse initiate utilize feeding protocol achieve target goal , couple new generational feeding protocol comprehensive nurse-directed nutritional educational intervention focus safe effective implementation . This focus nursing nutrition education represent major shift away traditional education focus dietitian physician . We hypothesize combination component safely improve provision energy protein compare usual care . We postulate increase provision calorie protein may translate improved clinical outcome , particularly patient extremes weight , current study power demonstrate difference . The purpose pilot study assess feasibility , acceptability , safety new feed protocol , `` The Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision via Enteral Route Critically Ill Patients : The PEP uP protocol .
