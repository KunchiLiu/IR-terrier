	<brief_summary>The primary aim study whether tailored behavioural medicine intervention address physical activity eat habit additional effect continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) patient moderate severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) combine obesity . Direct everyday life consequence ( see ) OSAS study , well cognitive function ventilatory parameter . Long-term benefit examine term quality life everyday life activity . Another aim study mechanism treatment effect , . The specific goal : 1 . To study change OSAS ventilatory parameter follow tailored behavioural medicine intervention address physical activity eat habit ( include CPAP ) compare regular CPAP-treatment 2 . To study immediate long-term effect daytime sleepiness , attention concentration , everyday life activity , quality life follow tailored behavioural medicine intervention address physical activity eat habit ( include CPAP ) compare regular CPAP-treatment 3 . To study association change metabolic parameter systemic inflammation physical activity level adherence CPAP-regimen respectively . 4 . To identify mediator , moderator , predictor treatment effect , .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSAS characterise loud snoring , upper airway obstruction , occasional apnea sleep . OSAS may affect least 4 % men 2 % woman middle-age . In Sweden , prevalence figure 200 000 report . The mechanism behind OSAS fully explain functionally impaired upper airway muscle , cause reduction tonic phasic contraction sleep , propose one key explanation . The reduced contraction cause partial complete occlusion airflow , turn cause oxygen desaturation sleep fragmentation . Patients commonly report everyday life consequence include loud snoring , sleep disturbance , daytime sleepiness , reduce alertness concentration , involvement motor vehicle accident . Between 7 % 70 % patient suffer depression anxiety ( figure vary extensively methodological difference exist study ) . Due cardiovascular consequence , OSAS also link hypertension , myocardial infarction , stroke . Approximately 75 % patient severe OSAS carry overweight . First line measure recommend OSAS conservative include lifestyle modification , CPAP , oral appliance . Current state-of-science concludes CPAP best possible evidence-based treatment . Despite use life style modification recommendation term physical activity weight loss accept guideline OSAS , randomise clinical trial support recommendation rare . Hence , value health behaviour modification yet establish . Research within area therefore major interest urgency , motivate present study design .</detailed_description>
