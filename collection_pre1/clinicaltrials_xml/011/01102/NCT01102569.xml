	<brief_summary>The aim study determine frequency three common BRCA1 BRCA2 genetic mutation commonly find Ashkenazi Jewish patient pancreatic cancer .

	<brief_title>Pancreatic Cancer Genetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause death malignancy United States . Up 15 % pancreatic cancer hereditary component . Several gene mutation cancer syndrome identify frequently find great frequency individual pancreatic cancer , include breast ovary cancer syndrome ( BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation ) . No study adequately describe epidemiology inherit pancreatic cancer genetic risk factor may modify penetrance BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation . The primary aim study determine frequency BRCA1 ( 185delAG,5382insC ) BRCA2 ( 6174delT ) mutation Ashkenazi Jewish pancreatic cancer patient . Secondary endpoint include determine individual frequency mutation disease-modifying mutation , death cause , disease-free survival , stage disease time presentation , difference tissue pathology , risk factor , treatment decision development metachronous malignancy . The investigator plan study 100 patient , enable true frequency mutation estimate . Although impact BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation initially study Ashkenazi population , data widely applicable pancreatic cancer patient carry BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation . Testing BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation relatives hereditary pancreatic cancer patient may allow early screening , treatment , resection pre-malignant tissue malignant lesion .</detailed_description>
