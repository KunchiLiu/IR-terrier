	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy internet-mediated pedometer base intervention design increase walk improve function among veteran chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The Specific Aims : 1 ) test effectiveness automate internet-mediated walking program veteran COPD primary outcome improvement health-related quality life four-months one year randomize control trial ( RCT ) wait list control . 2 ) estimate effect internet-mediated walking program veteran COPD cause day hospitalization one year follow randomization . 3 ) compare intervention reach , participation satisfaction outcomes rural urban veteran among randomized intervention arm . The long-term objective research develop , evaluate disseminate effective , low-cost intervention improve quality life veteran , particularly rural veteran , manage complex chronic condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Low level physical activity common patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , sedentary lifestyle associate poor outcome include increased mortality , frequent hospitalization , poor health-related quality life . Individuals COPD undergo facility-based , exercise-focused pulmonary rehabilitation program experience significant improvement health relate quality life , dyspnea , exercise tolerance well reduce rate hospitalization . Unfortunately , small percent individual COPD could benefit pulmonary rehabilitation access participate program . Moreover , benefit short-term pulmonary rehabilitation program tend diminish rapidly program end . Rural veteran less likely access facility-based pulmonary rehabilitation urban veteran . Health related quality life rural veteran COPD significantly bad veteran COPD live urban area . Objectives : The primary objective study assess efficacy Internet-mediated , pedometer-based intervention design increase walk health relate quality life Veterans COPD . The specific aim randomize control trial ( RCT ) wait list control : 1 ) To test effectiveness automate internet-mediated walk program veteran COPD primary outcome improvement health relate quality life four month one year ; 2 ) estimate effect internet-mediated walking program veteran COPD cause day hospitalization one year follow randomization ; 3 ) compare intervention reach , participation satisfaction outcomes rural urban veteran among randomized intervention arm . Methods : Participants follow 12 month investigate efficacy intervention assist patient initiate maintain regular walk program improve health relate quality life . Eligible consented patient wear pedometer obtain one week baseline data randomize 2:1 ratio Taking Healthy Steps wait list control . The intervention arm receive iterative step-count feedback ; individualize step-count goal , motivational informational message , access online community . Wait list control notify enrol , intervention would start one year ; however , keep pedometer access static webpage . Both group complete on-line survey assessment baseline , 4 , 12 month , ask report adverse event regular basis . The primary outcome change health relate quality life , measure use St George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) , disease-specific instrument patient COPD . Secondary outcomes include day hospitalization one-year intervention period , change average daily step measure use study pedometer , self-reported dyspnea , intervention reach , adverse event rate . The analysis conduct base [ original randomize treatment assignment regardless participation ( intent-to-treat analysis ) include complete case analysis well case analysis use linear mixed-effects model . Between-group difference change score ( 4 month 12 month ) estimate adjust baseline value outcome variable . Status : This study complete . Data analysis manuscript preparation continue .</detailed_description>
