	<brief_summary>Human urinary metabolic profiling show successful elucidate biomarkers link geographic origin specific food consumption pattern ( Holmes Loo et al . : Human metabolic phenotype diversity association diet blood pressure . Nature 2008:1-6 ) . It possible identify urinary metabolite directly link animal vs. vegetable protein intake . This valuable future population study , diet important lifestyle factor food questionnaire time-consuming expensive . Moreover , miss-reporting common problem . Our hypothesis find biochemical marker orange juice already find precede nutritional study participant record orange consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To elucidate citrus fruit biomarker need ensured volunteer consume citrus fruit food potentially contain similar ingredient . Therefore necessary ask volunteer refrain food give dietary restriction . Extensive literature research show food ( grain legumes brie cheese ) may contain compound , much small amount . Days 1-3 open diet dietary restriction ( alcohol , cheese , fruit , ethnic food Chinese Indian food , grain legume bean , lentil , pea peanut , kind sprout ( cress alfalfa ) ) . On day 2 glass orange juice ( 200ml ) consume addition open diet . Urine collection continue stop day 4 10 . During study minimise variation biomarker excretion due beverage participant beverage intake restricted water coffee . All urine sample analyse use high resolution NMR spectroscopy mass spectrometry . Mathematical data analysis well visual examination NMR spectrum also carry validate presence citrus fruit biomarkers .</detailed_description>
