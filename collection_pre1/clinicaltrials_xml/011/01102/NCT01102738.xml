	<brief_summary>Highly premature infant susceptible serious infection necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) late-onset blood stream infection ( BSIs ) . NEC poorly understood , potentially life-threatening bowel disorder . It think bacteria proliferate abnormally bowel may play important part cause , single pathogen yet identify . BSIs commonly cause gut bacteria . As highly premature gut fragile increase permeability , poor motility decrease immune defence , localise inflammation cause abnormal bacterial growth may allow 'bystander ' microbe translocate gut blood stream lead systemic infection . The investigator collect daily faecal sample premature ( &lt; 32 week ) infant intensive care unit day birth discharge . By use newly develop molecular detection technique investigator aim define precisely ever previously attempt , specie bacteria present faeces . This enable comparison pre-morbid post-morbid intestinal microbiota ( bacteria gut ) premature neonate . In small proportion infant develop NEC , surgery required part treatment condition . In infant investigator seek consent collect small part diseased bowel remove . Similar analysis perform sample . The analysis tissue sample give u indication well faeces act proxy intestinal microbiota . In ecological study evolution intestinal microbiota preterm infant , compare sample baby develop NEC late-onset BSI well baby investigator able look difference characteristic condition . This information help aid design prevention treatment strategy .</brief_summary>
