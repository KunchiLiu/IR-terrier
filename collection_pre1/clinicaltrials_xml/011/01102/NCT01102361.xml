	<brief_summary>The objective study examine effectiveness accuracy BioXbot prostate biopsy oppose transrectal biopsy . This evaluation efficacy procedure base : - Uptake rate - Peripheral zone reachability - Needling accuracy - Procedure execution time - Post operative discomfort trauma experience patient - Quality type tissue sample extract - Adverse unanticipated side-effects patient procedure record unexpected reaction</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prostate gland walnut-sized organ find men encircles urethra ( urine passage ) urinary bladder . It secrete fluid important component semen . Prostate cancer disease prostate gland malignant tumour cell invade normal prostate tissue spread organ . It second lead cause cancer death men mainly find men age 50 year . Prostate biopsy consider definitive diagnostic tool prostate cancer . It surgical procedure small sample tissue remove prostate gland examine pathologist . The procedure normally take 15 minute usually perform urologist conjunction transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) . No anesthetic require . With help TRUS , doctor guide biopsy gun -- hand-held device spring-loaded , slender needle -- wall rectum area prostate gland appear abnormal . Since rectal wall thin , possible place needle accurately less injury tissue . When activate , needle remove slender cylinder tissue , call core . Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy become standard obtain tissue histological diagnosis prostate cancer . On hand , transperineal approach commonly use worldwide little data available transperineal prostate biopsy . However , problem exist system include : - Random Biopsy Sites : Biopsy core represent 0.6 % prostate term volume . Therefore , without accurate knowledge cancer site , unlikely random biopsy protocol yield consistently high cancer detection rate . - Inaccurate Needling : The biopsy needle may reach desired position accurately quickly manual control . - Limited 2D Guidance : The TRUS use biopsy guidance 2D ultrasound image . As biopsy site distribute 3D , difficult surgeon imagine overall picture biopsy sit identify biopsy site accurately intuitively . - Risk Factors : The two primary risk needle biopsy severe bleed infection prostate gland urinary tract . - Transrectal Shortfalls : As cancer occur apex area prostate , transperineal biopsy consider high chance get cancer tissue , compare conventional transrectal biopsy . Furthermore , transperineal biopsy consider `` clean '' , puncture point skin , rather rectum . To assist surgeon transperineal biopsy , device name BioXbot design . BioXbot aim address shortfall transrectal method biopsy limitation exist robotic biopsy order improve cancer uptake rate . An ideal design need 2 operator complete procedure comfortable within comparable time conventional approach . A motorized needle position mechanism may also improve accuracy needle allow needle reach point within prostate scenario . BioXbot computer base motion control system software drive gantry mechanism assist position biopsy gun . It drive 2D ultrasound probe obtain series 2D image prostate model 3D view . This 3D visualization give surgeon good idea prostate allow plan biopsy sit intuitively . The mechanical component precisely align allow clinician accurately reach position inside prostate want obtain tissue . To improve usability position accuracy , well reduce operation time , position needle fully motorize .</detailed_description>
