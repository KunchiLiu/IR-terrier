	<brief_summary>The specific aim project create registry , well biospecimen bank individual pancreatic disease ( e.g . pancreatic adenocarcinoma , pancreatitis , intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) mucinous cystic neoplasm ( MCN ) , pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( PanIN ) determine high-risk pancreatic cancer . Biospecimen define blood , urine , tissue , stool , saliva sample . Therefore , hypothesis test . The personal data derive registry , correlate biological information derive biospecimens allow future investigative study pancreatic cancer etiology tumor biology . The long-term goal study advance knowledge etiology epidemiology pancreatic cancer . It anticipate knowledge derive ultimately lead improvement diagnosis , prevention , detection , treatment pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer fourth lead cause cancer death men woman United States . According American Cancer Society facts figure , approximately 43,920 people United Sates diagnose pancreatic cancer 2012 , expect 37,390 die disease . The dismal prognosis disease clearly depict fact incidence approximate mortality . Pancreatic cancer 95 % case fatality rate . The etiology pancreatic cancer remain elusive knowledge precursor natural history preliminary incomplete . The uniform fatality disease merit priority attention search cause . Due rapid progression disease , early detection prevention provide best hope reduce morbidity mortality . However , screen test available early detection and/or prevention neoplastic lesion poorly study prohibitively impractical general population . Further , pancreatic cancer risk factor well establish widely accept . Advanced age , family history , cigarette smoking , diabetes , dietary risk factor establish suspected risk factor . Due high volume individual see pancreas center , plan enrol 500+ individual per year either diagnose pancreatic disease high risk develop pancreatic cancer . All participant enrol clinic/non clinic visit Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) undergo baseline visit 3 subsequent visit . Additionally , base different condition pancreatic disease enrolling , subject participate aspect program . For example , individual cancer pre-neoplastic lesion tissue collect bank .</detailed_description>
