	<detailed_description>Radiation Therapy : If find eligible , receive radiation therapy 5 day 5 week . On Week 6 , receive radiation therapy 3 day . You assign dose level radiation base join study . Up 2 dose level radiation test . The first group participant receive low dose level . The next group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . Chemotherapy Administration : Your medical oncologist his/her team review discus aspect chemotherapy administration include drug receive , schedule chemotherapy , side effect start treatment . Your study doctor may adjust chemotherapy dose experience intolerable side effect . Study Visits : You weekly study visit receive radiation therapy . You may extra study visit doctor think necessary . At visit : - Your complete medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask feel side effect may . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You receive radiation chemotherapy 6 week . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Visit After Last Dose : You study visit 2 week ( +/- 5 day ) stop receive radiation . If unable return MD Anderson , may do phone . At visit : - Your complete medical history update . - You ask feel side effect may . - If doctor feel necessary physical exam , include measurement weight , vital sign , performance status record . If unable travel visit , physical exam . Follow-Up Visits : Your follow-up visit 4 week complete radiation treatment . Your doctor decide return test procedure perform . The following test procedure may perform : - Your complete medical history may record . - You may physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You may CT PET scan check status disease . - You may ask feeling side effect may . - You may upper GI endoscopy biopsy . If study doctor think need , every year ( +/- 2 month ) , follow test procedure perform check status disease : - You CT PET/CT scan . - You may upper endoscopy tumor biopsy . This investigational study . The chemotherapy agent FDA approve commercially available use treatment esophageal cancer . The high dose level radiation study consider investigational . Up 42 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
