	<brief_title>Dry Eye Assessment Management : Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye disease ( DED ) common often inadequately treated disease tear surface eye . It cause poor vision chronic pain frequent increase age . Inflammation may important component disease . This supported observation cyclosporine , drug target immune system , approve effectively treat DED . Inflammatory process likely produce ocular surface damage contribute chronic DED . Because people DED respond current anti-inflammatory treatment , immune-modulating treatment would value . Furthermore , despite great deal evidence support DED inflammatory disease , researcher currently agree classification . More data specifically measure inflammatory response DED need collect well-characterized patient population correlate sign symptom DED order improve understand classification disease . Essential Fatty Acids ( EFA ) show diminish inflammatory response many human inflammatory disease , interest use omega-3 omega-6 fatty acid disease treatment result several small study well use ( over-the-counter availability ) EFA-containing nutritional supplement , include several specifically treatment DED . Despite interest EFA DED , strong empirical data well-controlled randomize controlled trial RCT supporting use EFA DED . We postulate DED inflammatory disease hypothesize EFA mediate immune response , thus improve DED sign , symptom associate measure inflammation . The propose three month feasibility study allow u chance demonstrate ability successfully execute protocol compliance study patient begin process initiate full-scale multi-center trial .</detailed_description>
