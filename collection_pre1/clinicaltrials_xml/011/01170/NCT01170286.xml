	<brief_title>Safety Epicutaneous Immunotherapy Treatment Peanut Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peanut allergy common allergy United States , prevalence general population high 1 % . So far , approve treatment peanut allergy . Peanut allergy management base strict peanut avoidance injectable epinephrine allergic systemic reaction start . Specific Immunotherapy method currently available show limitation use safety issue . Hence , important unmet medical need efficient safe treatment peanut allergy . DBV Technologies develop epicutaneous delivery system , call Viaskin , method base deliver precise quantity allergen upper layer skin . Avoiding contact allergen bloodstream confer epicutaneous immunotherapy ( EPIT ) high level safety systemic reaction circumvent . The aim phase 1b study evaluate safety tolerability epicutaneous immunotherapy method subject allergic peanut . The trial randomize 110 participant . Four dos peanut protein , 20 mcg , 100 mcg , 250 mcg 500 mcg repeatedly deliver skin dose escalation consecutive cohort 5 subject , start low dose . In cohort 5 , 4 subject receive peanut proteins one receive placebo blind manner . For dose , peanut protein apply skin either every day every day . The total duration treatment subject 2 week . Firstly , adult subject ( 18 50 year ) history non-severe anaphylaxis peanut ( Grade ≤3 ) enroll safety information review . If major concern , adolescent cohort ( 12 17 year ) history non-severe anaphylaxis peanut enroll safety review . If concern , child cohort ( 6 11 year ) history non-severe anaphylaxis peanut finally enroll . Also , safety review treat adult non-severe cohort satisfactorily perform , adult subject history severe anaphylaxis peanut ( Grades 4 5 ) enroll dose escalation undergo . For safety review , follow parameter check patient visit : physical examination , vital sign , skin examination , lab value , PEF value . FEV1 , skin prick test peanut peanut-specific IgE value also determine screen end treatment visit .</detailed_description>
