	<detailed_description>Psoriasis prevalent immune-mediated skin disease affect 2-4 % world 's population . Severe psoriasis disable disease affect physical emotional well patient , effect quality life similar see major medical disease diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , cancer . Psoriasis prototypical Th-1 Th-17 inflammatory disease , demonstrate complex interplay innate adaptive immunity . Although etiology psoriasis still completely elucidate , basis exist knowledge , obvious psoriasis complex trait involve genetic , metabolic immune mechanism well environmental factor . Moreover , increasingly recognize psoriasis merely skin disease probably associate co-morbidities psoriatic arthritis , Crohn 's disease , metabolic syndrome CVD . Some co-morbidities often become clinically apparent year onset psoriasis frequently find patient severe disease . Furthermore , recently , study base large cohort psoriasis patient show severe psoriasis association increase mortality CVD find common cause death . The metabolic syndrome The metabolic syndrome combination diabetes mellitus type II ( insulin resistance ) , hypertension , central obesity , combine hyperlipidemia ( elevated LDL ; decrease HDL ; elevate triglyceride ) . The prevalence metabolic syndrome USA estimate 15 % population . Obesity , central feature metabolic syndrome , term modern `` epidemic '' western world . The metabolic syndrome component associate increase risk CVD , still lead cause death western world . Interestingly , inflammation also implicate pathophysiology metabolic syndrome . Th-1 Th-17 cell cytokine well adipocyte-derived-cytokines adipokines hormone identify . Excess number psoriatics obese , interestingly , average weight patient recent phase 3 study around 90Kg . Mechanistic link psoriasis co-morbidities Low-grade inflammation possibly mediate TNF suspect biological plausibility explain association discover epidemiological study link psoriasis co-morbidities especially metabolic syndrome . Progress understand immunology apparently diverse disease discover common physiological pathway . Clearly many different tissue organ common blood supply expose increase level inflammatory cytokine , chemokines mediator systemic circulation . The `` obesity psoriasis '' think key link metabolic syndrome well CVD . In past , know adipose tissue function energy store free fatty acid production . However , dramatic increase research role adipose tissue lead current view adipose tissue active endocrine organ many secretory product include adipokines cytokine . Moreover also recognize part innate immune system . Adipocytokines play important role pathogenesis insulin resistance associate metabolic complication dyslipidemia , hypertension , premature heart disease . TNF major mediator disrupt insulin receptor signal . Preventing co-morbidities In view chronic nature inflammation psoriasis linger process metabolic syndrome CVD development , important question whether effective , long-term control psoriasis could prevent , reverse , attenuate co-morbitides . Why trial important ? At present , know `` deep '' psoriasis go inflammatory disease . Inflammatory cell ( macrophage ) increase skin lesion psoriasis , go deep deep dermis/adipose tissue interface . Macrophages postulate cell increase adipose tissue , condition obesity , produce excess TNF thus directly cause disrupt insulin receptor signal adipocytes . The extension inflammation skin lesion could well continue fat , common inflammatory circuit drive skin disease obesity/metabolic syndrome common psoriasis patient . However , purpose study , consider adipose tissue skin functional compartment distinct epidermis dermis production adipokines mediator fat compartment drive metabolic derangement , also influence systemic risk cardiovascular disease . We believe treatment inflammation primary site disease , epidermis dermis skin lesion could correspond effect inflammation `` co-morbid '' tissue . Adipose tissue underlie psoriasis plaque accessible tissue direct analysis reduction co-morbidity pathophysiology . Interestingly , psoriasis lesion show alter expression leptin receptor `` skin '' component18 study do compare `` skin '' vs. adipose tissue . We want use powerful , high density , array functional image study assess degree inflammation associate metabolic derangement fat tissue determine extent reduction inflammatory circuit skin affect core pathology fat tissue . Associated biomarker functional assessment cardiovascular tree provide critical information whether associate cardiovascular dysfunction reverse treat inflammation primary site . If study successful , extend information pathophysiology psoriasis disease-specific co-morbid risk , also provide guidance whether long-term effective treatment inflammation could improve long-term tissue outcomes deep skin . Some study propose `` first '' study psoriasis stand create new research approach psoriasis disease similar inflammatory co-morbid risk . Preliminary Studies Studies rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient , another chronic inflammatory disease associate increase risk CVD , show response methotrexate treatment associate reduction CVD event mortality . Biologic treatment psoriasis , e.g . anti TNF-Î± ( etanercept ) anti p-40 ( ustekinumab ) , also show reduce C reactive protein ( CRP ) short-term trial . A key hypothesis study classical TNF pathway ( TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 NF kappa B immediate gene ) contribute directly metabolic alteration psoriatic patient pathway could also drive systemic inflammation . CRP produce liver response IL-6 . Many inflammatory mediator associate increased CVD risk make excess level psoriasis lesion may well contribute systemic inflammation burden release circulation . We use gene array RT-PCR follow systemic modulation CVD relate inflammatory molecule previous study extend analysis adipose tissue study . However , question whether long-term effective management psoriasis alter pathophysiology comorbid condition investigate yet .</detailed_description>
