	<brief_summary>Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) establish dialysis modality patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . However , grow awareness deleterious effect high glucose content PD solution peritoneal membrane time ( 1 ) . Accordingly , development new solution minimize glucose-induced toxicity and/or contain alternative osmotic agent glucose icodextrin amino-acid developed . Icodextrin mixture high molecular weight , water soluble glucose polymer isolate fractionation hydrolyze cornstarch ( 2 ) . Unlike glucose absorbed peritoneal cavity primarily diffusion across peritoneal capillary endothelium , absorption occur mainly due convective fluid movement peritoneal cavity via lymphatics ( 2 ) . As result , relatively constant osmotic pressure create icodextrin , thus provide sustained ultrafiltration long dwell . A number study report icodextrin-based solution provide various clinical benefit compare conventional glucose-based solution ( 3-7 ) . In particular , icodextrin successfully use fluid management PD patient ( 4-5 , 7 ) . However , excessive ultrafiltration may induce underhydration , result faster decline residual renal function . This concern first raise Konings et al ( 8 ) . In study , great fall residual glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) observe patient use icodextrin compare use 1.36 % glucose solution . In contrast , contradictory finding also report two study indicate residual renal function preserve icodextrin solution ( 4 , 9 ) . Although mechanisms clear , possible explanation include presence high-molecular-weight icodextrin metabolite plasma , turn may increase plasma oncotic pressure hence preserve plasma volume renal perfusion suggest Davies et al ( 10 ) . Such discrepant finding may explain difference study design , baseline fluid status , factor affect residual renal function study . In study Konings et al ( 8 ) , comparative solution 1.36 % glucose , whereas 2.27 % glucose use study Davies et al ( 4 ) . Therefore , speculate volume status might differ depend different concentration glucose solution , thus lead conflict result . Also , two prior study limit residual renal function secondary outcome , short follow-up duration ( 4 mo vs. 6 mo ) , small number patient ( 32 vs. 50 ) . To explore effect icodextrin solution residual renal function , investigator conduct multicenter prospective randomize control open-label trial . Briefly , incident prevalent adult CAPD patient residual urine volume &gt; 750 ml include . Patients APD exclude . After 4-week screening period , patient randomly assign icodextrin 2.5 % glucose solution long dwell . Residual GFR fluid status assess baseline , 6 , 12 month . Residual GFR calculate average urea creatinine clearance 24-hour urine collection . To assess fluid status , investigator use three different assessment tool ; 1 ) echocardiography measure intra vena cava ( IVC ) diameter leave ventricular end diastolic diameter , 2 ) measurement plasma atrial natriuretic peptide , 3 ) bioimpedence analysis . Primary outcome residual GFR change 1-year secondary outcome change fluid status study period . Also , biochemical laboratory data hemoglobin , hsCRP , plasma osmolality , lipid profile , peritoneal equilibration test , dialysis adequacy , daily peritoneal glucose exposure monitor . At least 50 subject ( total 100 ) would require group detect 50 % difference residual GFR two group type I error rate 5 % type II error 20 % give 30 % drop-out rate study period . Preservation residual renal function paramount importance independent risk factor mortality PD patient . In addition , achievement adequate ultrafiltration another crucial therapeutic goal improve clinical outcome patient . In regard , two goal accomplish icodextrin , would ideal dialysis solution PD practice . The investigator study address issue answer unresolved question effect icodextrin residual renal function .
