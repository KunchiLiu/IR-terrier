	<brief_title>Miralax ( PEG 3350 ) vs. Golytely Bowel Preparation Screening Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective To determine whether Miralax efficacious bowel cleanse standard Golytely screen colonoscopy . This study design power non-inferiority study . Primary aim : To compare quality bowel preparation Miralax Golytely Secondary Aims : - compare patient comfort tolerability 2 preparation regimen - evaluate effect age , gender tolerability bowel prep quality - determine either preparation associate acute electrolyte disturbance Background Colonoscopy standard method luminal evaluation colon . Bowel cleanse prior colonoscopy critical endoscopist obtain optimal visualization procedure therefore play integral role safety , efficacy diagnostic accuracy procedure . The bowel cleanse portion procedure often lament aspect colonoscopy experience . This often driven large volume liquid require consume , addition poor palatability colon cleanse regimen . Cleansing method variable , often time high volume solution time consuming , inconvenient uncomfortable , leading poor patient compliance . This translate decreased effectiveness colonoscopy exam often high cost due need repeat examination . Additionally , unknown much fear discomfort bowel preparation experience dissuade patient pursue screen colonoscopy colon cancer . An ideal bowel preparation would reliably cleanse colon rapid fashion , would alter colonic mucosa , result acceptable amount patient discomfort , would cause significant shift electrolyte would inexpensive . To date , bowel regimen meet criterion . One standard bowel preparation regimens polyethylene glycol ( PEG , Golytely ) lavage solution entail consume 4 L water mixed powder packet contain main ingredient ( 255g polyethylene glycol 3350 ) along electrolyte ( 22.74 g anhydrous sodium sulfate , 6.74 g sodium bicarbonate , 5.86 g sodium chloride , 2.97 g potassium chloride ) . This non-absorbable , iso-osmotic solution mildly salty taste induces diarrhea rapidly clean bowel , usually within 4 hour . This solution first introduce 1980 's currently widely use bowel cleanse regimen ( 1 ) . It proven safety efficacy due high volume , often difficult patient tolerate ( 2-7 ) . It estimate least 5-15 % patient complete preparation due large volume and/or poor palatability ( 8 , 9 ) . The literature also confirm patient prefer low volume solution comfort tolerability ( 7 , 10 ) . Oral sodium phosphate solution ( e.g . Fleets PhosphoSoda® ) equally efficacious show well tolerated low volume alternative PEG ( 11 ) . They FDA approve bowel cleanse use extensively select patient prior colonoscopy recently . However , December 11 , 2008 , FDA issue statement conclude use oral sodium phosphate preparation pose risk serious adverse event , notably acute phosphate nephropathy- type acute kidney injury- select patient ( patient age 55 , baseline kidney disease , diuretic , angiotensin convert enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitor , NSAIDs angiotensin-receptor blocker [ ARBs ] etc ) ( 12-14 ) . As result , FDA require manufacturer oral sodium phosphate bowel preparation add Boxed Warning label product . Subsequently , manufacturer voluntarily remove product retail sale . There 20 randomize control trial literature search `` ideal '' bowel preparation ( 11 ) . With removal oral sodium phosphate preparation market , search well tolerate bowel cleanse regimen continue . Miralax ( PEG 3350 ) , polyethylene glycol powder alone without electrolyte FDA approve constipation . It mixed 8-12 ounce beverage use daily . Because lack taste ( electrolyte ) use bowel cleanser colonoscopy . Generally , 255 g Miralax combine 64 oz Gatorade bowel cleanse prior colonoscopy . While FDA approve indication , widely use accept alternative Golytely numerous endoscopy center across country . PEG 3350 's safety efficacy document multiple study child undergo colonoscopy ( 15 , 16 ) . A recent single arm feasibility study describe letter editor American Journal Gastroenterology 2008 find use Miralax ( PEG 3350 ) colonoscopic preparation tolerable safe adult ( 17 ) . Moreover study report high compliance . It include 29 patient underwent screen colonoscopy PEG 3350 64 oz Gatorade® ( The Gatorade Company , Chicago , IL ) . A `` good prep '' describe 97 % case ; patient rat tolerance good 86 % . Insomnia common adverse effect . Of note , 18 patient prior 4L PEG bowel cleanse experiences- , 50 % report PEG 3350 well tolerate . Beyond data , investigator community center ( Urbana , IL ) 3 year exclusive experience PEG 3350 colon preparation ; report anecdotally well patient tolerance compliance prior preparation . The inclusion Gatorade® reduce potential electrolyte disturbance . In addition low volume , PEG 3350 ( Miralax ) storied palatable easily accessible counter ; also simple , uncomplicated regimen . Based theory great ease use , improve taste , low volume low level induce discomfort would result good patient compliance , completion bowel preparation subsequent improvement visualization colonoscopy , PEG 3350 ( Miralax ) appear promise `` ideal '' cleanse agent . To date , head head comparison MiraLAX Golytely term efficacy patient tolerability bowel cleanse regimen colonoscopy . Eligibility Criteria Inclusion criterion - All adult undergoing average risk colon cancer screening ( age 40-75 year old ) - Able provide inform consent Exclusion criterion - A history constipation - Patients use medication assist bowel movement osmotic , stimulant , cathartic laxative ( include `` colon cleanser '' ) - Diabetes glucose intolerance - Patients severe underlying renal hepatic impairment - Pregnant woman - pregnancy test perform menstruate woman procedure . Treatment Plan This prospective , randomize , endoscopist-blinded study carry Temple University Hospital . All adult patient undergoing outpatient colonoscopy screen enrollment study .

The risk benefit exam also discuss . Once patient schedule , medical assistant schedule exam open opaque envelope assign patient exam preparation . She give script Golytely Miralax . Gatorade must purchase participant . The detail bowel preparation : - All patient advise clear liquid breakfast , lunch dinner day prior plan colonoscopy . - Based randomization assignment , subject instruct either 1 . Consume 4 L polyethylene glycol ( Golytely ) Or 2 . Consume 255 g PEG 3350 ( Miralax ) 64 oz yellow Gatorade . The choice Lemon-Lime , Lemonade , All-Stars Lemon Lime flavor primarily yellow . Study participant instruct take nothing mouth midnight day colonoscopy . They also advise avoid discussing detail bowel preparation endoscopist colonoscopy . Upon arrival schedule colonoscopy appointment prior procedure , patient provide short survey assess bowel preparation experience ( please refer appendix document Patient Survey detail ) . Also time insertion intravenous catheter ( required procedure ) 5 cc blood drawn complete metabolic panel send TUH laboratory evaluate electrolyte disturbance . All procedure perform Temple University Hospital Digestive Disease Center PI . He blind type bowel preparation randomize patient . Upon completion procedure , endoscopist document adequacy preparation ( 24 ) . The preparation quality assess portion colon accord follow scale ( see appendix ) : Boston Bowel Prep Scale 0 unprepared colon segment mucosa see solid stool clear 1. portion mucosa colon segment see , area colon segment well see staining , residual stool and/or opaque liquid 2. minor amount residual staining , small fragment stool , and/or opaque liquid , mucosa colon segment well see 3. entire mucosa colon segment see well , residual staining , small fragment stool , opaque liquid A sum score calculate base rating colonic segment . In order ass validity reliability rating scale intra-observer inter-observer reliability assess . This do take representative high resolution digital photograph colonic segment withdraw phase colonoscopy . The photograph print de-identified . At end study PI blindly grade prep use photograph present random fashion . A second experienced colonoscopist Temple faculty also grade prep assess inter-observer reliability . Risks The risk study include use colonoscopy bowel preparation agent FDA approve indication well inherent risk colonoscopy . The added risk study related preparation . Risks preparation include failure cleanse colon adequately risk electrolyte abnormality , particularly hypokalemia . The risk undergoing colonoscopy include bleed potentially require transfusion blood product , infection , bowel perforation possibly require surgical intervention , adverse reaction anesthesia/sedation , miss lesion . These risk rare standard colonoscopic exam regardless study participation . Benefits The benefit afford study subject would include potential early detection treatment colorectal cancer , prevention colorectal cancer removal pre-malignant polyp development cancer prevention surveillance strategy base colonoscopic finding . Also , 50 % patient consume preparation likely far palatable standard preparation , Golytely . Alternative Treatments Cancer prevention test offer patient meet criterion CRC screening . The preferred cancer prevention test colonoscopy . Alternative cancer prevention test include flexible sigmoidoscopy compute tomography colonography . Patients decline colonoscopy cancer prevention test offer cancer detection test . The preferred cancer detection test fecal immunochemical testing . Alternative cancer detection test include Hemoccult Sensa fecal guaiac base test fecal DNA testing . No CRC screen alternative . ( 1 ) Data Collection Statistics Sample Size Calculation The primary objective study compare efficacy , tolerability safety standard bowel preparation Golytely novel bowel preparation agent Miralax . The study non-inferiority study : The objective conclude prep quality score receive Miralax 10 % le Golytely . Thus difference prep score Miralax minus Golytely great - 10 % . If case , Miralax would consider non-inferior Golytely . To calculate sample size perform one-sided test base binomial distribution intent demonstrate Miralax non-inferior calculate one-sided p-value less 0.05 . If true difference Miralax Golytely exactly 0 % , test give p-value le 0.05 probability 0.80 . Since want conclude difference responder , Miralax minus Golytely , great - 10 % , choose null hypothesis H0 : true difference proportion less equal - 0.10 alternative hypothesis H1 : true difference proportion great - 0.10 . Based study Lai others ( 24 ) , 0-9 scale expect mean prep score Golytely 6.2 standard deviation 1.5 .
