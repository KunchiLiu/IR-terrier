Unless ECG ( electrocardiogram ) trace heart rhythm record patient symptom , difficult determine cause palpitation . The conventional approach refer patient emergency department Cardiology outpatient undergo repeat short term rhythm monitoring hoping record rhythm underlie patient 's complaint .

This study aim compare ability conventional approach establish definite diagnosis compare early invasive monitoring approach small implantable device record heart rhythm time 18 month .</brief_summary>
