	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness safety computer software program provide insulin dosage recommendation . Participation study 60 research subject last 16-weeks include 3-4 clinic visit series weekly telephone call study team ( minimum 12 call ) . Participants provide weekly Study Log Sheets record daily blood glucose reading , insulin dos , gram carbohydrate eat meal ( type-1 diabetes ) change health ( e.g. , hypoglycemic episode , illness ) . Participants fax drop copy Study Log Sheet . This information enter IDC study team computer software program . The IDC study team review information software , base IDC 's study team approval , insulin dose change communicate back patient phone fax .</brief_summary>
