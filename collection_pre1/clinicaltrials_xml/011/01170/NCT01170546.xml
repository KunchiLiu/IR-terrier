	<brief_title>Effects Hamstring Training Different Modes Stabilizing Knee Joints With Anterior Drawer Laxity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries commonly see among athlete , eventually make less devastating impact performance . Although ACL injury may result knee collision , 70 % due noncontact movement , include abrupt brake , change direction high speed ( i.e . sidestep cutting crossover cutting ) . In , one must first axial foot fix ground absorb momentum orient original direction . Insufficient eccentric muscle ligament strength likely trigger muscle ligament injury . It generally agree risk ligament injury reduce strengthen specific muscle group dynamic stability joint able enhance static stability provide ligament also compensate . Traditionally , strengthen exercise ACL rehabilitation put emphasis hamstring quadriceps attempt decrease anterior drawer instability well shear force ACL . Nonetheless , aforementioned pathomechanism ACL injury , knee rotators value suppose . The internal rotators knee joint ( semitendinosus , semimembranosus gracilis ) highly related ACL injuries5 . However , knee rotator strength often neglect even sacrifice autograft ACL reconstruction . Modifications make progressive resistance exercise strengthen knee internal rotators . In current study , 20 subject anterior drawer laxity randomly assign three group adopt different train mode : plate-loaded squat press ( SP ) , plate-loaded kneeling leg curl internal rotation ( KLCIR ) , plate-loaded kneeling leg curl ( KLC ) . Static stability , dynamic stability , isokinetic strength measure . The purpose paper find optimal solution enhancement static dynamic knee stability great extent . MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects The research program approve Human Subject Committee Taipei Physical Education College . Knee joint laxity survey KT-2000 test ( MED Metric Co. , San Diego , USA ) Department Physical Education Health Taipei Physical Education College . The anterior drawer laxity knee joint study define anterior displacement 3 mm discrepancy bilateral knee joint KT-2000 test 20-pound force . According criterion , Dale M. et al . demonstrate 85 % ( 33/39 ) population complete ACL tear 15 % ( 6/39 ) partial tear . One hundred seventy-three student test 30 met criterion , include 22 male 8 female , although obvious trauma history available . Two male exclude due cause might affect muscle strength knee stability lower limbs fracture arthritis . Besides , eight female student eliminate avoid possible gender difference . Twenty male student include experimental group . Another 8 male student stable knee without medical history knee injury include control group . The participant experimental control group live sedentary lifestyle . Stable knee define discrepancy le 1.5mm bilateral knee KT-2000 test 20-pound force . Flow Path Twenty subject experimental group randomly assign three group : SP ( n=7 ) , KLCIR ( n=7 ) KLC ( n=6 ) . Eight control subject neither received training engage body-building training period . Every subject ask fill basic information , include age , body height , body weight . Before experiment , flow path explain subject already sign informed-consent form . The experimental procedure divide three phase . The first third phase test train respectively , include KT-2000 , agility , isokinetic strength assessment . The second phase training phase . Static Stability ( Laxity ) The KT-2000 knee ligament arthrometer ( MED Metric Co. , San Diego , USA ) design assess anterior drawer laxity knee joint . The discrepancy anterior displacement sound side lesion side report applied evaluate static stability knee , also use one reference ACL reconstruction surgery . In current study , discrepancy le 1.5mm normally accept 20-pound anterior traction force exert tibia knee joint 20° flexion . In contrast , ACL laxity define discrepancy 3mm , highly related ACL injury . Dynamic Stability ( Agility ) Dynamic knee stability assess agility , measure 6-meter left-and-right shuttle run . A good dynamic knee stability necessary change movement direction . Each subject start run midline leave terminal step square left foot . Then , subject use left leg axis turn around right side . The subject run right terminal . Once front foot cross midline , first round test agility leave knee . The subject kept run right terminal without stop midline , step square right foot , turn around left side , run toward leave terminal . This first round right knee test subject 's front foot cross midline . Whenever front foot cross midline , timer clock . The time interval second 1st 2nd time clock 1st measure leave knee agility , time interval 2nd 3rd 1st measure right knee agility , forth . There five-round test agility right leave knee respectively . Three raters assign respectively midline , right left terminal . Single-blind method adopt . That , three raters know group subject assign . The square right leave terminal end 10 inch wide 3 meter away midline . It would recognize qualified round plantar surface foot ever contact part square ; otherwise , subject would ask repeat whole set consist five round . Three set collect average . The rest interval set long enough examinee feel relaxed next set . The subject ask run fast possible . The average time difference 3 set affect sound side regard dynamic stability affect side . The great difference , poor dynamic stability agility would . A practice session give prior actual beginning study avoid learn effect . Prior study , intrarater test-retest reliability establish . Nine subject , include four experimental group five control group , take agility exam twice separate day . The intraclass correlation coefficient 0.78 . Isokinetic Strength Cybex NORM ( Cybex International , Inc , Ronkonkoma , New York , U.S.A. ) employ evaluate isokinetic muscle strength training . Tests conduct two different motion mode include flexor/extensor internal /external rotator . In former , range motion set range 0-90° . Maximal concentric force perform five time angular velocity 60° , 120° 180° per second , respectively . Peak torque take represent muscle strength . Only smooth similar curve peak torque le 90 % maximum would take . The assessment isokinetic strength internal/external rotator generally similar flexor/extensor . The ankle joint fix 30° dorsiflexion air-stirrup ankle brace ( Aircast , Summit , NJ ) limit unnecessary inversion/eversion movement , might affect measurement knee joint rotation . In addition , knee hip joint keep 90° , range motion knee rotation set range 25° internally 35° externally . Training Modes Three train mode choose . ( Ⅰ ) SP ( call angle leg press ) ; ( Ⅱ ) KLCIR ; ( Ⅲ ) KLC . The training phase last 6 week none drop . Each subject accomplish three training workout weekly supervision license athletic trainer . A workout contain five set low limb , compose 20 ( repetition ) ×60 % ( 1RM ) , 15×65 % , 12×70 % , 8×75 % 20×60 % two-minute resting interval set . During six-week rehabilitation course , allow involve regular fitness activity sport . Data Analysis Data express mean±SEM . SPSS version 12.0 Windows use statistic analysis . Nonparametric analysis , include Kruskal-Wallis Test , Wilcoxon Test Mann-Whitney test , apply . Significance define P &lt; 0.05 . Intrarater reliability assess intraclass correlation coefficient .</detailed_description>
