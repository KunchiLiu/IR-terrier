	<brief_title>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML ) Patients Undergoing Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) life-threatening haematological malignancy . Initial treatment induction chemotherapy require 4-5 week hospitalization , risk physical deconditioning , decline quality life ( QOL ) , significant fatigue . Four pilot exercise study demonstrate improved fitness , strength , QOL , fatigue patient undergoing induction , limit small sample size , recruitment mostly young adult , inconsistent endpoint , design issue . Prior conduct large multi-centre randomized control trial ( RCT ) , important pilot work first need do demonstrate feasibility randomize trial exercise program AML patient undergo induction chemotherapy ; ensure safety ; provide effect estimate intervention fitness QOL/fatigue endpoint . Objectives : Primary objective : ( 1 ) determine feasibility recruitment retention adult AML patient randomize trial supervise exercise ability patient perform exercise intervention hospital ; ( 2 ) provide estimate effect exercise fitness parameter . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) determine effect exercise QOL fatigue ; ( 2 ) understand impact exercise AML treatment tolerability ; ( 3 ) examine safety exercise intervention . Methods : Thirty-five patient age 18 old newly diagnose relapse AML undergoing induction chemotherapy recruit Princess Margaret Hospital . Participants perform 30-45 minute supervise aerobic resistance exercise 4-5 day per week . Primary outcomes recruitment rate , exercise adherence rate , impact fitness measure ( peak aerobic capacity ( VO2peak ) , grip strength , leg strength , 6-minute walk test ) . QOL measure European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) core 30-item questionnaire ( QLQ-C30 ) . Fatigue measure use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy fatigue subscale ( FACT-Fatigue ) . Treatment tolerability outcomes include length stay , intensive care unit admission , development sepsis . Outcomes time assess use mixed effect regression model . Significance : Exercise promise intervention improve fitness , QOL treatment tolerability AML patient undergo induction chemotherapy . This pilot RCT establish feasibility safety , well provide efficacy estimate vital design conduct definitive multi-centre RCT exercise patient population .</detailed_description>
