	<brief_summary>Patients sometimes suffer life-threatening abnormal heart race originates low chamber heart . These patient often need implantable defibrillator ability shock heart back normal heart rhythm , prevent get frequent recurrence bad heart rhythm need shock device . This painful potentially harmful . Medicines prevent recurrence shock effective many side effect . An alternative medicine procedure call catheter ablation wire pass blood vessel leg heart use find short circuit cause dangerous heart rhythm . When spot cause trouble find , investigator burn ( `` ablate '' ) . This procedure challenge method need make effective easy . One main way find short circuit involve use electrocardiogram ( `` ECG '' ) . The regular ECG simplistic make use recording 10 site ( 6 precordial site 4 site upper low limb ) body surface . The investigator test whether make recording 120 site chest back use special computerized analysis recording help make catheter ablation dangerous heart rhythm effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several conventional advanced mapping technique frequently utilized accomplish successful catheter ablation . Many map technique ( activation mapping , entrainment mapping ) hamper either hemodynamic instability tachycardia non-sustainability others . Pacemapping commonly use tool map non-sustained hemodynamically unstable VT , base upon principle activation heart give site yield reproducible body surface electrocardiogram ( ECG ) morphology pace site close site VT activate heart result match ECG morphology . This technique , however , limited imperfect accuracy spatial resolution , subjectivity interpretation lead mark inter-observer variability perceive quality morphologic match , need intuitive interpretation ECG direct catheter manipulation . We hypothesize one improve accuracy origin VT localize apply body surface potential mapping ( BSPM ) , use data derive 120 simultaneously acquire ECGs . Objectives : 1 . To quantify similarity BSPM waveform induce VT pacemapping two different pace site use two waveform comparison metric , correlation coefficient ( CORR ) root mean square error ( RMSE ) test validity metric marker proximity pace site site early ventricular activation . 2 . To compare accuracy origin ventricular tachycardia localize via pacemapping apply ( BSPM ) , use data derive 120 simultaneously acquire ECGs , accuracy localization different ECG subset e.g . 12-lead ECG X , Y Z lead . Patient method : We anticipate patient fall one flow 4 group : Group A : Patients focal VT structurally normal heart . Group B : Patients scar relate VT exit site identify . Group C : Patients scar relate VT exit site identified.Group D : Patients present SVT . For group , data body-surface potential mapping ( BSPM ) record induced VT ( Group A &amp; B ) , pace virtual VT exit sit several point select around scar margin represent VT exit site ( group C ) index pace site pace site select reference RV patient present SVT ( group D ) different pacemapping site include successful unsuccessful ablation sit applicable . All data import customized software . The improvement arithmetic value two comparison metric test site pacing approach site early ventricular activation ( Groups A &amp; B ) virtual VT exit site group C index pace site ( group D ) . The best CORR RMSE BSPM obtain VT ( group A B ) /virtual VT exit site ( group C ) index pace site ( group D ) different pace site ( include successful unsuccessful ablation site ) record . A simple linear regression use compare CORR RMSE difference pace site distance pace site successful ablation site surrogate best pace-match ( group A B ) correspond virtual VT exit site ( group C ) index pace site ( group D ) . P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . The mean sensitivity , specificity , positive- negative-predictive accuracy arithmetic metric determine VT origin/exit site determine . We repeat previous protocol use different ECG subset include 12 lead ECGs X , Y Z lead . The predictive accuracy different subset electrodes measure compare derive use whole BSPM obtain 120 ECG lead .</detailed_description>
