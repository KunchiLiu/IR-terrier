	<brief_summary>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) condition affect whole body . It cause inflammation blood vessel result earlier thicken harden artery result stroke . It report SLE worsen function result heart failure . The aim study examine effect Rosuvastatin , cholesterol lower drug , give patient degree thicken artery course two year . We also want see affect function blood vessel also heart . Individuals agree participate randomly assign two group . One group give active drug whereas placebo . Subjects study cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) scan treatment , 1 year 2 year end treatment . Each scan involve image carotid artery neck , artery arm also heart . Individuals continue regular out-patient review team doctor , regular blood test take monitor disease also ensure safety well individual . At end 2 year study hope able slow rate arterial thicken retard plaque build artery . We also want see effect rosuvastatin heart function . Ultimately , hope prove people SLE treat cholesterol lower drug part routine treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) auto-immune condition , multisystem , connective tissue disorder wide spectrum disease ( D'Cruz et al 2007 ) , include cardiovascular manifestation . It condition primarily affect female predominance 10:1 . The peak onset 18 40 year age . The incidence report high amongst Asian African ethnic group . In UK , incidence 3.8 per 100 000 per year , prevalence 26.2 per 100 000 . The incidence among white UK population 3.0 per 100 000 per year , whereas 10.0 among Asians 21.89 among Afro-Caribbean population , high population study far ( Danchenko 2006 ) . No clear aetiology identify , genetics complex . The range cardiovascular manifestation vary ; include accelerated atherosclerosis , vascular inflammation ( El-Magadmi , 2002 ) ventricular dysfunction ( Pieretti J , 2007 ) . The presence carotid atherosclerosis strong predictor future cardiovascular event ( Belcaro G , 1996 ) , identification plaque within carotid artery study use ultrasound . Studies also conduct investigate endothelial dysfunction relationship SLE . - Case study patient SLE show patient SLE increase carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) ultrasound ( US ) study ( Svenungsson E , 2001 ) . - US study SLE report endothelial dysfunction demonstrate bu US flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) ( Lima DS , 2002 , Celermaier DS , 1994 ) . - Ultrasound study SLE demonstrate significant correlation dysfunctional endothelium ( reduce flow-mediated dilatation/brachial artery reactivity ) carotid IMT ( Raza K , 2000 ) . - Myocardial dysfunction , particular , increased leave ventricular ejection fraction mass due leave ventricular hypertrophy identify population ( Chow PC , 2007 , Pieretti J , 2007 ) . The excess cardiovascular risk patient SLE attribute corticosteroid usage treatment condition give explanation increase atherosclerosis ( Petri M , 1992 , 1996 ) . Although , corticosteroid therapy cause hypertension , diabetes dyslipidaemia , cumulative steroid dose also surrogate marker disease severity . Studies also show patient condition hypertensive increase tendency smoker ( Asanuma Y , 2003 ) . However , separate study show despite high incidence hypertension , diabetes earlier menopause , 10 year Framingham risk score match healthy control ( Bruce IN , 2003 ) . This would suggest risk factor present SLE adequately explain conventional cardiovascular risk assessment model . In fact , SLE strong independent risk factor atherosclerosis . Due inflammatory nature SLE consistent recent paradigm shift towards concept atherosclerosis disease vascular inflammation . Vascular inflammation lead endothelial vascular damage predispose atherosclerosis ( Ross R , 1999 ) . The association dyslipidemia SLE demonstrate ( Svenungsson E , 2001 ) . There elevation LDL-cholesterol , triglycerides lipoprotein ( ) ( Asanuma Y , 2003 ) decrease HDL-cholesterol ( Borba EF , 1994 ) . Together elevation alpha-1 anti-trypsin homocysteine level lead condition conducive development atherosclerosis . The mainstay treatment atherosclerosis SLE predominantly direct control inflammation aggressive conventional cardiovascular disease risk factor management corticosteroid , anti-inflammatory disease modify drug ( cyclosporin A azathioprine ) . For lipid management , suggest even absence atherosclerosis , LDL-cholesterol level &lt; 2.6mmol/L . However , limited clinical data demonstrate benefit approach ( Wajed J,2004 , Bruce IN , 2005 ) . There much publish data effect lipid lower drug statin ( HMG-Co A reductase inhibitor ) plaque regression ( Corti,2001 , 2005 , Lima J , 2004 ) . These trial demonstrate significant reduction amount plaque within vessel wall well reduction LDL-cholesterol . A recently publish randomised placebo-controlled trial ( METEOR ) ( Crouse J , 2007 ) show rosuvastatin 40mg daily 2 year arrest carotid plaque progression continue placebo group . This study highly significant ( P &lt; 0.01 ) . In study , carotid plaque carotid intima medium thickness ( CIMT ) assess B-mode ultrasound . Such study prove benefit use statin low risk establish plaque disease .</detailed_description>
