	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tear common injury lead pain loss function suffer . Treatment include use arthroscopic surgery return function patient reduce pain . This study interested technique potential improve patient outcome term less pain good function surgery . Autologous Conditioned Plasma ( ACP ) Platelet Rich Plasma ( PRP ) intervention interest , simply patient 's blood withdrawn spun obtain high concentration cell call platelet . Platelets release growth factor important healing , well fibrin , act like biological glue . The PRP re-injected shoulder time surgery 4 week . It show accelerate healing study injuries chronic elbow tendinopathy , randomize control trial evaluates effect PRP rotator cuff tear . It basis study perform . Participating patient receive either PRP injection placebo ( normal saline ) effect compare 2 week , 4 week , 6 week base pain score return function questionnaire . The primary hypothesis study ACP compare placebo effective reduce pain site rotator cuff injury undergone arthroscopic repair . It expect ACP administer surgery 4 week post-surgery reduce 6-week pain score compare placebo group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Arthroscopic Surgery Platelet Rich Plasma In Rotator Cuff Tear Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Men woman 18 70 year age . Primary , traumatic degenerative rotator cuff tear measure 3 cm less . Rotator cuff tear require arthroscopic repair within 18 month initial diagnosis . Provision inform consent . Rotator cuff tear secondary fracture . Patients associated dislocation time randomization . Rotator cuff tear underwent prior surgical repair revision arthroscopy . Nonsurgical rotator cuff associate treatment 1 month prior randomization include corticosteroid injection antiinflammatory treatment . Prior platelet rich plasma injection . Preexisting condition associate upper extremity pain , include arthritis , ongoing infection , carpal tunnel syndrome , cervical neuropathy nerve pathology , local malignancy , systemic disorder ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , hypothyroidism ) . Patients gross shoulder instability . Patients active infection . Patients pregnant plan become pregnant next 12 month . Patients preoperative platelet count le 125,000 preoperative hemoglobin 7.5g/dl le . Likely problem followup ( i.e . patient fixed address , report plan move town , intellectually challenge patient without adequate family support ) . Patients read speak English . Patients participate another ongoing trial would interfere assessment primary secondary outcome . Any reason ( judgment surgeon ) .</criteria>
