	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Fiber may lessen bowel side effect cause radiation therapy . It yet know whether high-fiber diet effective low-fiber diet prevent bowel side effect cause radiation therapy . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study high-fiber diet see well work compare low-fiber diet prevent bowel side effect patient undergo radiation therapy gynecological cancer , bladder cancer , colorectal cancer , anal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low-Fiber Diet High-Fiber Diet Preventing Bowel Side Effects Patients Undergoing Radiation Therapy Gynecological Cancer , Bladder Cancer , Colorectal Cancer , Anal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare efficacy high- v low-fiber intervention prevent bowel toxicity patient receive radical pelvic radiotherapy treatment gynecological , urological ( bladder ) , colorectal , anal malignancy . - To compare whether high- low-fiber intervention beneficial effect intervention ( i.e. , ad-libitum fiber consumption ) . - To examine effect low- high-fiber diet gastrointestinal symptom , measure use IBDQ-B Bristol Stool Chart , patient receive radical radiotherapy pelvic malignancy . - To minimize potential risk associate change fiber intake use control gradual dietary-based intervention combine dietetic advice . Secondary - To examine relationship volume irradiate bowel onset gastrointestinal symptom measure Bristol Stool Chart . - To measure percentage compliance fiber prescription validate dietetic technique include 7-day Food Diary use household measure 24-hour recall . OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord disease ( gynecological v gastrointestinal ) concomitant therapy ( receive vs receive ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I ( low-fiber diet ) : Patients assess qualified dietitian , receive write guidance , counsel best meet study fiber prescription low-fiber diet , comprise 'not ' 10 g fiber per day 7 week . - Arm II ( high-fiber diet ) : Patients assess qualified dietitian , receive write guidance , counsel best meet study fiber prescription high-fiber diet , comprise target 18 22 g fiber per day 7 week . - Arm III ( intervention ) : Patients receive advice design ensure maintain normal habitual diet 7 week . All patient undergo radiotherapy daily comprise approximately 25 ( ) fraction total deliver 5-7 week absence unacceptable toxicity . All patient ask complete two 7-day Food Diaries baseline end radiotherapy treatment . All patient keep daily record stool characteristic frequency use Bristol Stool Chart . Patients also complete short 1-page weekly-cost questionnaire assess economic impact symptom management . Patients arm I II complete several additional question regard cost ( ) adhere fiber prescription palatability diet . Blood stool sample may collect baseline study therapy biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
