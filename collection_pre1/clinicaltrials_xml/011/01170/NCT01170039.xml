	<brief_summary>The investigator recruit total 136 diabetic men woman constipation study The Emory Clinic The Atlanta Veteran 's Administration Hospital . The investigator track spontaneous bowel movement define bowel movement 24 hour initiation study drug ( SBMs ) patient two week treatment lubiprostone well measure baseline colonic transit use Smartpill pH capsule . Colon transit reflect rate colonic peristalsis movement stool large bowel . Patients receive either lubiprostone 24 microgram ( mcg ) orally twice day 8 week placebo . Primary secondary endpoint number SBMs/week colonic transit time measure Smartpill capsule , respectively . The number SBMs/week evaluate 0 , 2 , 4 8 week initiation therapy . The investigator over-sample African American patient achieve approximately 50 % enrollment group . In subanalysis , investigator assess response treatment general population African Americans . We hypothesize lubiprostone significantly increase number SBMs well decrease colonic transit time improve quality life constipate diabetic patient compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) common United States , incidence well prevalence disease increase . DM risk factor cardiovascular pulmonary condition , also link several digestive complication . Among digestive complaint , constipation occurs approximate two-thirds patient DM , make constipation common gastrointestinal ( GI ) complaint among type 2 diabetic . Consequently , patient suffer abdominal pain , bloating , low health relate quality life compare patient without DM GI symptoms.Constipated individual may reluctant eat regular schedule may worsen glycemic control well symptoms relate underlying diabetic enteropathy . Effective therapy constipation limit little data evaluate treatment constipation , specifically diabetic patient . Lubiprostone show superior placebo increase number spontaneous bowel movement ( SBMs ) patient chronic idiopathic constipation ( CIC ) irritable bowel syndrome constipation ( IBS-C ) . However , lubiprostone previously study diabetic suffer constipation . Furthermore , prokinetic pharmacotherapeutics target toward constipated patient diabetes mellitus type 2 lacking . African Americans high rate DM compare ethnic group Unites States . Furthermore , constipation prevalent African Americans compare minority group . However , little data evaluate prevalence constipation response treatment African Americans . Therefore , information regard severity symptom , difference bowel pattern , colonic transit , response therapy important improve management constipation group . Hence , subanalysis , study whether responsiveness African American patient lubiprostone differs general population . Given dearth information effectiveness lubiprostone diabetic , particularly strong need alternative safe effective treatment constipation , propose ass effectiveness lubiprostone constipate diabetic men woman . This randomized double- blind placebo control trial lubiprostone treatment constipation diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
