	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Effects Epoetin Hospira Epogen/Epoetin Alfa ( Amgen ) When Administered IV Patients With Chronic Renal Failure Requiring Hemodialysis Receiving Epoetin Maintenance Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , active-controlled , cross-over , evaluator-blind , Phase I study patient chronic renal failure require hemodialysis . The study comprise 4-week Screening Period , 1-week Pre-Treatment Period , 1-week Treatment Period 1 , 1-week Treatment Period 2 Follow-up visit Week 7 . Subject eligibility determine 4-week Screening Period . All subject must optimally titrate stable qualify entry Pre-Treatment Period . During 1-week Pre-treatment period patient continue stable dose receive Screening Period . Blood sample collect Pre-Treatment Period ass pharmacokinetics Epogen . Eligible subject randomize Day 1 Treatment Period 1 receive either Epoetin Hospira Epogen ( Amgen ) intravenous ( IV ) bolus injection administer three time week 1 week . Subjects switch receive alternate study drug three time week 1 week Treatment Period 2 . Blood sample collect Treatment period 1 2 ass pharmacokinetics Epoetin Hospira Epogen . Primary endpoint , i.e . pharmacokinetics concentration , evaluator blind . After complete Treatment Period 2 , subject receive standard care treatment undergo Follow-up Visit Week 7 ( i.e. , 28 day Treatment Period 2 ) .</detailed_description>
