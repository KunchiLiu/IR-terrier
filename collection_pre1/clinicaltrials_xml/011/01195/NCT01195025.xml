	<brief_summary>Volume kinetics method mostly use , far , study distribution elimination crystalloid solution . Voluven ( Sweden commonly use colloid replacement bleed surgery ) poorly study , though . Also , recent study show unexpected volume kinetics crystalloid solution give colloid solution . The investigator aim study volume kinetics crystalloids colloid also combination two detail . The investigator also compare invasive hemoglobin measurement measurements new non-invasive tool ( Radical 7 , Masimo Inc. ) could help make volume kinetics practical everyday use . Finally investigator also study concentration coagulation factor see explain variation coagulability describe early study infusion solution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We study ten volunteer , one three occasion . Each volunteer receive crystalloid one time , colloid another time , third occasion first colloid crystalloid one hour later . The different protocol random order different volunteer . During test sample hemoglobin ( invasive non-invasive ) every fifth minute beginning ( every tenth minute later ) infusion . On six nine occasion test analyse Albumin , Cystatin-C , Ig-G , Ig-M marker hemodilution D-Dimer , Fibrinogen , Factor VII , PK-INR ( prothrombin complex international normalize ratio ) , aPTT ( activate partial thromboplastin time ) marker coagulation . The volunteer also monitor regard non-invasive blood pressure pulse rate .</detailed_description>
