	<brief_summary>Background : Uveitis serious inflammatory condition body 's immune system attack part eye , often cause vision loss . Uveitis treatment involve various drug suppress immune system , medicine sometimes work may cause serious side effect . Researchers interested develop new treatment uveitis effective few side effect . Optiquel® experimental medication test effectiveness uveitis . It contain B27PD , small protein fragment , similar protein part eye attack immune system . Taking Optiquel® ( B27PD ) mouth may induce oral tolerance , immune system teach recognize attack normal part human body . Objectives : To evaluate safety effectiveness B27PD ( Optiquel® ) treatment uveitis . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age noninfectious uveitis one eye least 3 month , vision 20/200 good least one eye , take daily prednisone equivalent medication . Design : Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , eye exam . This study last maximum 52 week . During first 12 week study , participant study visit every 2 week . For remainder study , participant study visit every 4 week . Participants frequent blood urine test , also eye examination special procedure ( fluorescein angiography indocyanine green angiography ) evaluate effectiveness treatment . Participants randomly assign one three group receive either one two different dos B27PD placebo . During study , participant also dose prednisone steroid medication reduce . Participants take one capsule three time per week Monday , Wednesday , Friday , total 24 week . Participants may take capsule water , consume drink kind food least 30 minute pass prevent stomach upset . The capsule store refrigerator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optiquel® Corticosteroid-sparing Therapy Chronic Noninfectious Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study evaluate safety efficacy peptide B27PD ( Optiquel® ) corticosteroid-sparing agent chronic non-infectious uveitis participant receive oral corticosteroid therapy alone combine immunosuppressive agent proof-of-concept clinical trial . Study Population : Patients non-infectious uveitis require least 20 mg 40 mg oral prednisone , equipotent dose alternative corticosteroid medication maintain quiescent eye , eligible . Design : In single center , Phase I/II , double-masked , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group treatment study , safety efficacy peptide B27PD investigate 60 participant non-infectious uveitis . Initially , 60 participant enrol ; however , due lack efficacy , 31 participant enrol . Eligible participant randomize one three treatment group : 1 mg B27PD , 4 mg B27PD placebo , take three time per week 24 week . All remain participant follow common termination date . The common termination date establish last enrolled participant reach his/her Week 28 visit ( four week follow his/her last investigational treatment ) .The time recurrence uveitis either eye occur 52 week follow initial dose evaluated treatment group . Recurrence define increase anterior chamber cell and/or vitreous haze least 2 step [ use Standardization Uveitis Nomenclature ( SUN ) grade system ] . Ophthalmic examination assess uveitis include visual acuity , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , slit lamp biomicroscopy , ophthalmoscopy , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) fluorescein angiography . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome variable time recurrence uveitis activity participant treatment group , taper oral prednisone dose 7.5 mg/day , equipotent dose alternative corticosteroid medication . Secondary efficacy outcome variable include proportion participant determine Treatment Failure , define recurrence ( flare ) uveitis ( least 2-step increase use SUN grade system ) drop visual acuity ≥ 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter 24 52 week . Other secondary efficacy outcome include reduction exposure corticosteroid measure area dose-time curve , change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , fluorescein angiography , fundus autofluorescence high-speed indocyanine green angiography ( HS-ICG ) . Ocular safety measurement include intraocular pressure ( IOP ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) confirmation suspect macular edema . Systemic safety variable include adverse event , clinical blood chemistry hematology , urinalysis , vital sign , weight medical evaluation baseline end study .</detailed_description>

Participant must receive current treatment prednisone 20 40 mg/day ( equipotent dose alternative corticosteroid ) . Participants regimen one antimetabolite inhibitor time randomization ( e.g. , azathioprine , methotrexate , mycophenolate ) addition prednisone may enrol allow continue antimetabolite . The participant 's uveitis must control eligible eye , quiescent eye [ anterior chamber cell vitreous haze Standardization Uveitis Nomenclature ( SUN ) grade 0 ] . The participant 's eligible eye ( ) able evaluate activity disease biomicroscopically ophthalmoscopically . The participant 's baseline intraocular pressure must &gt; 5 mmHg ≤ 30 mmHg eye . Concurrent use intraocular pressurelowering medication and/or prior glaucoma surgery acceptable . Participant bestcorrected distance visual acuity well see eye 20/200 good [ ≥ 34 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) letter ] . Female participant childbearing potential must pregnant lactating must willing undergo serum pregnancy test throughout study . Women childbearing potential must agree use reliable method contraception receive study medication 6 week follow last administration . Acceptable method contraception include hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation partner vasectomy ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant noniatrogenic immunodeficiency state [ e.g. , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection congenital immunodeficiency ] . Participant intraocular surgery intraocular injection within three month prior randomization . Participant expect elective ocular surgery intraocular injection study period . Participant use systemic corticosteroid therapy nonocular disease nonocular organ involvement . Participant history diagnosis Behcet 's disease . Participant clinically suspect and/or confirmed central nervous system ocular lymphoma . Participant active systemic infectious disease malignancy require treatment . Participant know chronic disease condition gastrointestinal system may interfere wih absorption investigational product determine investigator ( e.g. , active hepatitis , chronic diarrhea , inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , celiac disease , diverticulosis diverticulitis ) . Participant two food allergy . Participant implant contain antiinflammatory , immunosuppressive antiviral drug , unless period 50 % longer anticipated duration effect implant elapse . Participant receive periocular corticosteroid injection within 4 month prior randomization expect need periocular corticosteroid injection study duration . Participant receive treatment infliximab , etanercept , adalimumab , interferon , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , sirolimus , within two week prior randomization . Participant receive cytotoxic therapy ( e.g. , cyclophosphamide ) within six month prior randomization .
