	<brief_title>Human Heterologous Liver Cells Infusion Children With Urea Cycle Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urea cycle disorder rare inherit disease generally poor outcome , especially onset disease neonatal period . UCDs cause deficiency one six enzymes responsible remove ammonia bloodstream . Instead convert urea remove body urine , ammonia accumulates UCD patient lead brain damage death . In light mortality rate &gt; 50 % age 10 year current pharmacological dietary therapy modest success . Furthermore , mental retardation , cerebral palsy neurological sequelae common among survive patient . In last year , orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) become best therapeutic option UCD long-term survival rate 90 % . However , first week life OLT still technically demand prone complication . With large size recipient , technical problem OLT decrease considerably . The increase body weight usually achieve age 8 week related major reduction transplantation relate morbidity . Stabilization metabolism patient undergo OLT essential . In study , young child UCD treat repetitive application human liver cell . In last consequence , aim new therapy option supply sufficient amount healthy liver cell compensate metabolic defect reduce risk neurological deterioration await OLT .</detailed_description>
