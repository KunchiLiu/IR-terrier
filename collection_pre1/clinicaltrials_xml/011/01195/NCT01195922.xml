	<brief_summary>Background : - Advanced-stage head neck cancer ( head neck squamous cell carcinoma [ HNSCC ] ) moderately successful treatment outcome , usually involve surgery part standard treatment . Researchers investigate use drug rapamycin prevent tumor growth HNSCC , interested use treat individual HNSCC treat previously drug , radiation , surgery . Objectives : - To evaluate usefulness rapamycin decrease tumor size prior surgery head neck squamous cell carcinoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma yet treat . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , image study . - Approximately 1 month schedule surgery , participant begin receive rapamycin . Participants take rapamycin daily 21 day , follow 7-day period without drug . - During 21-day rapamycin treatment , participant weekly study visit provide blood urine sample possible tumor biopsy image study x-rays tumor photograph . Participants additional study visit test 1 day 1 week end rapamycin treatment , follow HNSCC surgery . - Participants final visit provide blood sample 30 day surgery . - Participants medical record review 1 year surgery ; however , participant need study visit time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - The five-year survival rate head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remain approximately 50 % three decade . - In HNSCC , AKT-mTOR-pS6 pathway aberrantly activate promotes tumorigenesis metastasis . - Rapamycin extensively study mTOR inhibitor therapeutic daily oral dose schedule , pharmacologic level blood , safety establish . - Inhibition mTOR rapamycin cause rapid apoptotic death HNSCC tumor xenograft decrease tumor burden prolongs survival mouse harbor early advanced oral skin SCC lesion variety experimental cancer model . - Preliminary evidence suggest mTOR inhibitor cause tumor shrinkage improve tumor margin HNSCC patient . OBJECTIVES : - The primary objective evaluate follow patient HNSCC give rapamycin neoadjuvant treatment prior surgery chemoradiation : - Whether therapeutic activity rapamycin lead inhibition mTOR complex , mTORC1 mTORC2 , assess change level pS6 pAkt473 measure immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) tumor sample Western blot peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) reduce tumor cell proliferation , judge IHC Ki-67 tumor sample . - Antitumor activity term objective response . - Secondary objective include safety evaluation rapamycin therapy , exploratory study possible effect rapamycin tumor size , dynamic CT perfusion , FDG-PET ; evaluation tumor proliferation , apoptosis , microvessel density , molecular change associate effect . Survival status , recurrence disease , metastasis , adverse events/serious adverse event , include complication wound healing , relate rapamycin therapy also assess 360 day surgery chemoradiation medical record review . ELIGIBILITY : - Males female age 18 year old - Previously untreated HNSCC oral cavity oropharynx - Clinical stage II , III , IVA disease without distant metastasis - Definitive therapy include surgical resection chemoradiation curative purpose - Life expectancy great six month STUDY DESIGN : - Pilot , single arm , open-label , interventional neoadjuvant clinical trial . - Twenty one evaluable subject take rapamycin ( sirolimus ) orally per day 21 day . - Before dosing , tumor photograph biopsied , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) collect , compute tomography positron emission tomography scan perform . - Surgical chemoradiation treatment , provide outside protocol , conduct Day 28 rapamycin level less equal 3 nanogram per milliter . - Subjects followed medical record review 360 day surgery chemoradiation ass 1 ) survival , 2 ) recurrence disease , 3 ) metastasis , 4 ) adverse events/serious adverse event related rapamycin therapy , include complication wound heal infection due immune compromise . - Levels pS6 pAkt473 tumor tissue PBMCs Ki-67 tumor tissue rapamycin therapy determine immunohistochemistry Western blotting . Computed tomography ( CT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan head , neck , chest region without contrast perform within 7 day prior first rapamycin administration . One day last administration rapamycin CT PET scan ( head neck region ) contrast repeat . - A single stage design use base response define &gt; 25 % tumor shrinkage . A Wilcoxon sign rank test use compare level pS6 , pAkt473 , Ki-67 rapamycin therapy . As part secondary analysis , number subject achieve best response complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) , stable disease ( SD ) , progressive disease ( PD ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 also summarize .</detailed_description>
