	<brief_summary>Background : - Developmental dyscalculia learn disability individual difficulty learn comprehend mathematics number concept ( keep score game , measure time , estimate distance ) . Developmental dyscalculia affect certain part brain require processing number . Research show form brain stimulation call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , apply healthy individual train carry task number , improve ability process number solve math problem . More research need whether tDCS improve number processing people developmental dyscalculia . Objectives : - To examine whether effect transcranial direct current stimulation help individual developmental dyscalculia perform mathematical calculation . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age diagnose developmental dyscalculia , healthy volunteer without dyscalculia . Design : - Participants screen visit seven study visit . The screen visit six study visit take place consecutively course 6 day , final visit take place 3 month initial participation . - Participants screen medical history , physical neurological examination , brief examination test dyscalculia determine participant 's dominant hand . - Participants randomly assign one two group study . One group receive tDCS train perform task number , group receive training sham stimulation . Participants know group . - During study visit , participant train number task 6 consecutive day . Before tDCS sham stimulation apply begin experiment end training day , participant perform tasks number . Participants evaluate base accuracy speed respond question . - At followup visit , participant perform number task complete study visit . No tDCS perform visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Facilitating Numerical Processing With Transcranial Stimulation Developmental Dyscalculia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Developmental dyscalculia ( DD ) condition subject process adequately numerical concept . Performance arithmetical calculation associate fMRI activity extend brain network include parietal prefrontal cortex . Areas within parietal lobe , require numerical processing healthy subject , abnormal subject DD . The purpose single-blinded study determine facilitatory transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) parietal area association numerical training improve process numerical information relative sham subject DD healthy volunteer . Study population 30 healthy volunteer 30 subject developmental dyscalculia ( DD ) . Design Healthy volunteer subject DD randomly assign one two group . Each group receive anodal tDCS sham numerical training . All subject participate 7 session . First , train ordinal numerical task ( numerical training task ) learn magnitude relation two number 6 consecutive day receive sham stimulation tDCS training . Subjects see two number screen , one viewed leave side screen right side screen ( example , 2 , 4 ) , decide one large . Performance evaluate fit power-law function . Before begin experiment training day subject perform numerical Stroop task assess automaticity numerical processing , number-space task provide information subject 's accuracy mapping number space . At end 6 training day ( immediately post training ) 3 month ( seventh session ) later ( retention measure ) subject test dyscalculia test ( The Dyscalculia Screener ) , numerical Stroop task , number-space task Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure improvement automatic numerical processing ( numerical Stroop task ) reflect reaction time . Secondary outcome accuracy map number space ( number-space task ) improvement dyscalculia score ( Dyscalculia Screener ) .</detailed_description>
