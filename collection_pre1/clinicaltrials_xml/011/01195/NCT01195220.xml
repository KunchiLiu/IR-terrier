	<brief_title>Project AWARE : Using Emergency Department ( ED ) Prevent Sexually Transmitted Infections ( STIs ) Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Almost half new sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) occur young people age 15-24.1 The vast majority ( 88 % ) consist chlamydia ( CT ) , gonorrhea ( GC ) , human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , trichomoniasis.1 Additionally , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) report young people age 15-24 account 7,297 new HIV diagnose 2008 , 17.7 % new diagnosis year.2 Inner-city , sexually active adolescent exceptionally vulnerable contract HIV STIs.3 In 2008 , Bronx high proportion AIDS case borough New York City.5 For Bronx female age 15 19 , CT infection case rate 7,621 per 100,000 812 per 100,000 GC , high age group New York City.4 The infection rate among young men age 15-19 Bronx also high New York City : case rate 2,092 CT 458 GC.4 Based concern adolescent HIV risk , CDC change HIV test paradigm recommend routine HIV test adolescent . It also recommend routine HIV screening patient seek STI test treatment STI clinics.6 However , universal STI screening adolescent routine medical setting , even though STIs asymptomatic therefore undiagnosed . We believe screen youth HIV provide opportunity screen STIs well , test combine harm reduction intervention . This project evaluate efficacy Project AWARE diagnose , treat , prevent HIV STI infection Bronx Emergency Department ( ED ) . This proposal base eight year research experience develop test successful ED-based multimedia program HIV prevention.7 The first four year focus develop videos educate adult ED patient encourage tested HIV . Project BRIEF-A achieved high acceptance ( 95 % ) adult HIV testing link 85 % HIV+ patient specialize medical care.8,9 The last 4 year develop Project BRIEF-T , efficient , youth-friendly , theory-based harm reduction video intervention teens.10 It deliver different short video intervention youth base stage change . Results promise : Project BRIEF-T effective move youth next stage change intention use condom . We propose application test Project AWARE , add universal STI test Project BRIEF-T , evaluate effect theory-based video intervention condom use 4 , 8 , 12 month post-testing . Project AWARE evaluate use three group randomize trial . Group 1 , control , current standard care , consent video test HIV alone ( HIV-T ) . Group 2 add routine STI test CT GC , ( STI/HIV-T ) . Group 3 , addition combine STI/HIV testing , add behavioral video encourage safe sex , choose participant base answer brief measure stage change ( STI/HIV-PLUS ) . Comparing Group 1 Group 2 identify number new STI infection identify routine test establish whether routine screen successfully identify substantial number new case routine care . Comparing Group 1 Group 3 identify whether addition Stages Change intervention significantly increase condom use among teen . Specific Aims : 1 . To compare efficacy three study arm test significant difference 4 month follow order provide information program concern efficient use resource . 2 . To study persistence intervention effect time 4 12 month primary outcome well examine intervention effect condom use intention , condom self-efficacy , condom outcome expectancy reduce sexual risk behavior , follow time point . 3 . To estimate prevalence STIs baseline . The project explicitly translational . If Project AWARE efficiently identify treat asymptomatic HIV STIs , successfully reduce subsequent sexual risk behavior among teen , implement EDs relatively low cost . Given new emphasis U.S. efficient preventive care , project provide exemplary portable intervention tool reach many high risk youth asymptomatic STIs HIV access routine primary care . The study 's result might also contribute development new screen policy incorporate multiple STIs exist HIV screening .</detailed_description>
