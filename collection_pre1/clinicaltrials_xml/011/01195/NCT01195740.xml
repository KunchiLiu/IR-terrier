	<detailed_description>Annually , adolescent young adult United States die suicide cancer , heart disease , AIDS , birth defect , stroke , pneumonia , influenza chronic lung disease combine ( U.S. Public Health Service , 1999 ) . Each year approximately 1 5 teenager seriously consider kill , one million teenager attempt suicide , 1,600 2,000 die suicide ( U.S. Public Health Service , 1999 ) . Clearly , need empirically base treatment model urgently need . Typically , suicide attempt report suicidal ideation intent plan kill , adolescent treat psychiatric hospital . In past , inpatient stay could provide intensive individual , group , family , medication therapy . However , manage care shift goal hospitalization treatment stabilization . Adolescents discharge deem longer threat , leave treatment precipitate factor outpatient aftercare . In recent review 21 study compliance aftercare , Daniel colleague ( 2004 ) find majority youth receive aftercare , noncompliance high . Very little evidence find support effectiveness aftercare . Surprisingly study prevent adolescent reattempts suicide hospitalization . Important study Harrington et al . ( 1998 ) King et al . ( 2007 ) show promising result aftercare reduce suicidal ideation , publish study look prevent reattempts . Given dearth treatment study youth attempt suicide general , surprising even few study aftercare population . Yet , give high cost even short inpatient treatment , develop test effective aftercare program build gain make inpatient treatment youth attempt suicide seem warrant . One promising outpatient treatment approach population Attachment-Based Family Therapy ( ABFT ; Diamond et al. , 2002 ) . ABFT manualized , brief ( i.e. , 12 16 week ) family-based model design specifically treat depress suicidal adolescent .

In many family , repair attachment rupture require `` work '' prior traumatic event ( e.g. , loss , divorce , abuse ) often associate suicidal behavior . As adolescent become less preoccupied suicide ideation family conflict , treatment focus parent help adolescent navigate challenge school , peer relation life domain . ABFT recently proven effective reduce suicidal ideation depressive symptom non-hospitalized population identify primary care ( Diamond et al. , 2007 ) . This grant set foundation programmatic look treat adolescent psychiatrically hospitalize attempt suicide . This study two improvement current aftercare service . First , improve quality aftercare use empirically base , family-based , manualized treatment . Second , rely continuity care model aftercare treatment begin family still hospital , potentially enhance treatment compliance adolescent leave hospital . - Objective 1 : Develop collaborative relationship Belmont Psychiatric hospital Therapeutic Bridge Program foster research infrastructure support future adolescent suicide clinical trial research . This include integrate standardized assessment tool inpatient procedure establish procedure make referral research program . - Objective 2 : Evaluate feasibility acceptability ABFT outpatient aftercare youth suicide attempt , discharge inpatient care . This evaluated ability make contact least 80 % eligible patient , collect weekly follow data , obtain least 90 % post treatment data , meet recruitment goal , retain patient treatment least 10 session , rat high patient report treatment acceptability satisfaction . - Objective 3 : In exploratory fashion , examine differential effect size Enhanced Usual Care ( EUC ) ABFT 14 week post hospital discharge ) prevent future suicide attempt , b ) reducing associate risk factor ( suicide ideation , depression , family conflict ) c ) increase treatment compliance ( e.g. , time first session , number session attend ) .</detailed_description>
