	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study vismodegib gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient advanced pancreatic cancer . Vismodegib may stop growth pancreatic cancer block blow flow tumor . Gemcitabine hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving vismodegib gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vismodegib Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain tumor biopsy therapy GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) evaluate effect inhibition hedgehog signal pancreatic cancer stem cell : evaluate tumor number percentage pancreatic cancer stem cell treatment GDC-0449 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression free survival ( PFS ) 3 month follow treatment GDC-0449 gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) . II . To assess response rate treatment overall survival patient advance pancreas cancer treat GDC-0449 alone combination gemcitabine . III . To evaluate toxicity GDC-0449 alone combination gemcitabine . OUTLINE : Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 ( begin course 2 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>

appropriate method contraception consider acceptable ; woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately ; Pregnancy testing : omen childbearing potential require negative serum pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 25 mIU/mL betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ bHCG ] ) within 1014 day within 24 hour prior first dose GDC0449 ( serum urine ) ; pregnancy test ( serum urine ) administer every 4 week menstrual cycle regular every 2 week cycle irregular study within 24hour period prior administration GDC0449 ; positive urine test must confirm serum pregnancy test ; prior dispense GDC0449 , investigator must confirm document patient 's use two contraceptive method , date negative pregnancy test , confirm patient 's understanding teratogenic potential GDC0449 Patients take medication narrow therapeutic index metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) may enrol caution ; GDC0449 substrate CYP3A4 ; however , vitro metabolic conversion GDC0449 low ; effect cytochrome ( CYP ) inducer ( e.g. , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , rifabutin , rifampin , St. John 's wart , troglitazone ) clinical concentration GDC0449 unknown ; likewise , effect strong inhibitor CYP3A4 ( e.g. , clarithromycin , erythromycin , itraconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , telithromycin ) GDC0449 clinical concentration unknown , caution exercise dose GDC0449 concurrently inhibitors CYP3A4 ;
