	<brief_summary>The study compare clinical angiographic outcome patient receive Hydrocoil aneurysm treatment versus patient receive non-HydroCoil aneurysm treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HydroCoil Cerebral Aneurysm Treatment Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With prospective , randomized trial progress evaluate effectiveness Hydrocoils Cerecyte coil comparison bare platinum coil , next step direct comparison Hydrocoils non-HydroCoils ( Cerecyte Platinum ) . Considering increased cost society treatment new coil , essential benefit new technology properly evaluate exist platinum coil technology scientifically valid manner .</detailed_description>
