	<brief_title>Safety Study Four Chimera Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Vaccines Healthy Adult Males 30-50 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total thirty six participant enrol . The first 12 participant randomize four group . Four group receive one four investigational vaccine . The four investigational HCMV vaccine candidate administer subcutaneously 3 volunteer 10 pfu ( low dose use ) . The safety tolerability four investigational HCMV vaccine candidate monitor closely period 12 week follow vaccination dose . Investigational vaccine find safe well tolerate dose 10pfu administer 3 additional individual 102 pfu 103 pfu . Safety tolerability evaluate dose level monitor clinical sign symptom , laboratory parameter virus detection blood , urine , saliva . After 12-week safety-monitoring period , participant follow remainder one year ass long-term safety immunogenicity investigational vaccine .</detailed_description>
