	<brief_summary>Chronic periodontitis common infectious disease characterize progressive attachment loss alveolar bone resorption eventually result tooth loss . The ultimate goal periodontal therapy prevent endpoint . At least strict supportive care program implement follow active therapy , subsequent tooth loss limit mean 0.1 per patient per year . In contrast , three six time many teeth may lose disease leave untreated . The objective supportive care prevent disease recurrence , accomplish strict home care professional plaque control regular interval depend patient 's need . Evidently , patient optimally compliant term plaque control . Therefore , chemical aid could administer supplement mechanical plaque removal . Essential oil solution contain menthol , thymol , methyl salicylate eucalyptol active agent may appropriate supplement daily home care . Clinical study show additional anti-plaque anti-gingivitis effect mechanical plaque control without relevant side effect healthy subject gingivitis patient . Recently , significant reduction periodontopathogens subgingival biofilm show periodontitis patient follow subgingival irrigation use essential oil solution . In addition , mouthrinsing daily basis seem substantially alter subgingival microflora towards less pathogenic one gingivitis periodontitis patient . Even though interesting finding , consider exploratory since relate small number patient observe two week . The goal present study thoroughly document clinical microbiological effect essential oil solution use daily basis 3 month adjunct mechanical plaque control measure large number chronic periodontitis patient supportive care .</brief_summary>
