	<brief_summary>Acute Lung Injury/Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) serious frequently encounter entity modern ICUs . Sepsis remain common cause ALI/ARDS carry bad prognosis . The disease characterize intense inflammatory process . This inflammation play major role development gas exchange abnormality see course disease . Statins , primarily use lipid-lowering agent , know possess anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , antithrombogenic vascular function-restoring action . Therefore investigator propose determine Simvastatin may useful decrease incidence deadly syndrome critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simvastatin Effect Incidence Acute Lung Injury/Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ALI/ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients enrol within 24 hour ICU admission randomize 1 2 group : Simvastatin placebo . Patients ' management entirely leave primary team , include need daily laboratory imaging . In addition , restriction use medication , deem necessary primary care physician . The primary endpoint incidence ALI/ARDS . Secondary efficacy variable number day without organ system failure , addition change IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF- α . Treatment continue primary endpoint reach , patient discharge ICU maximum duration 2 week , whichever occur first . Patients continue followed total 28 day , discharge hospital , whichever occur first . Patients randomize , ratio 1:1 either Simvastatin 40 mg PO daily placebo tablet daily format identical Simvastatin . The mortality ALI/ARDS remain significant . In absence effective therapy , prophylaxis patient risk important goal achieve . Therefore , Simvastatin find decrease incidence ALI/ARDS , would significant advance management deadly frequent syndrome . We set Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) closely monitor progress trial ( DSMB Charter attach application ) . Any adverse event report directly institutional review board ( IRB ) DSMB . All adverse event report annual review protocol .</detailed_description>
