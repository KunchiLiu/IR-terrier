	<detailed_description>Broad evidence exist beneficial effect pulmonary rehabilitation exercise capability quality life COPD patient . Clinically relevant effect achieve train program differ design regard setting ( inpatient vs. outpatient vs. home-based ) , duration ( short-term vs. long-term ) intensity ( high vs. low intensity ) . While sufficient evidence propose pulmonary rehabilitation use generally low clinical practice . One reason may unlikely costly program offer significant proportion eligible patient . The ideal training program therefore time accomplish great improvement regard physical capability quality life sustain long period low cost . The purpose present study evaluate whether continuous , low-intensity , low-cost , physiotherapist-led outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program able achieve significant long-term improvement exercise tolerance quality life moderate severe COPD patient low cost level previously publish program .</detailed_description>
