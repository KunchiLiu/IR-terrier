	<brief_summary>This investigator initiate pilot study observe short-term outcome ( follow-up period six month ) patient undergo laparoscopic paraesophageal Hiatal hernia ( PEH ) repair use Veritas® Collagen Matrix brand biological mesh . This preliminary study University Washington . A PEH occur stomach protrudes diaphragm next esophagus . The chance recurrence Hiatal hernia laparoscopic PEH repair 20-40 % within 6 months.During laparoscopic PEH repair , mesh-type product use scaffold . The mesh serf reinforce material surgical repair . It cut appropriate size need hernia suture surround diaphragmatic tissue . There many different type mesh available market , vary degree manageability , strength , adherence . Although surgical mesh work principal , variance material may affect patient outcomes . There evidence biologic mesh , specifically one derive Small Intestinal Submucosa ( SIS ) , decrease short-term ( 6-month ) recurrence rate compare synthetic mesh another type biologic mesh . A biologic mesh , serve scaffold , replace patient 's tissue 6 month . Theoretically , would prevent possible complication associate synthetic mesh include mesh erosion esophagus stricture esophagus . There case series show similar short-term result different biologic mesh , direct comparative data .</brief_summary>
