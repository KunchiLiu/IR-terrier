	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate benefit switch away efavirenz ( part combination pill , Atripla® ) patient central nervous system side effect ( insomnia { difficulty sleep } , bad dream etc ) . The investigator investigate effect switch Truvada ( combination pill tenofovir emtricitabine , two component Atripla ) plus raltegravir . Raltegravir license drug HIV treatment show side effect few number compare efavirenz 2 clinical study , patient start HIV treatment first time . This study also investigate safety ( term side effect routine blood test investigator ordinarily use monitor treatment ) monitor effectiveness , viral load CD4 count , switch treatment Atripla® Truvada/raltegravir .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The majority individual commence treatment HIV UK start regimen include EFV combination antiretrovirals . These regimen convenient ( daily dose ) highly efficacious . However EFV several potential drawback include continued CNS toxicity , potential teratogenesis low barrier development virological resistance . Clinically control trial frequently report undesirable nervous system side effect patient receive 600 mg EFV antiretroviral agent , include dizziness , insomnia , somnolence , impaired concentration abnormal dreaming . CNS symptom moderate severe intensity experience 19.4 % patient compare 9.0 % patient receive control regimen . These symptom severe 2.0 % patient receive EFV 600 mg daily 1.3 % patient receive control regimen . In clinical study 2.1 % patient treat 600 mg EFV discontinue therapy nervous system symptoms The majority individual commence treatment HIV UK start regimen include EFV combination antiretrovirals .
