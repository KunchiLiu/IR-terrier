	<brief_title>A Drug Interaction Study 31001074 Paroxetine Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( volunteer study physician know identity study treatment ) pharmacokinetic study determine effect , multiple 20-mg dos paroxetine concentration single dose study drug ( referred 31001074 ) bloodstream paroxetine 31001074 administer orally ( mouth ) healthy adult volunteer . Paroxetine approve drug use treat patient psychiatric disorder 31001074 drug currently development potential us treatment patient nervous system disorder . Approximately 14 healthy volunteer participate study approximately 45 day ( include screen period 29 day determine eligibility 16 day treatment period ) . Volunteers require stay overnight study center 16-day treatment period . During 16-day treatment period , volunteer receive 2 dos 31001074 12 dos paroxetine . At Screening , blood sample collect volunteer pharmacogenomic analysis ( ie , genetic testing ) identify volunteer genetically-determined high activity enzyme ( CYP2D6 ) involve process 31001074 body . Additional blood sample obtain volunteer protocol-specified time point study determine concentration 31001074 paroxetine plasma ( colorless portion blood ) . Safety evaluate study monitor adverse event ( side effect ) report findings clinical laboratory test , vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination perform . In addition , volunteer instruct report occurrence adverse event consider study physician serious ( define protocol ) 30 day administration last dose study drug . A single dose 31001074 administer Day 1 Day 13 ( total 2 dos ) . Paroxetine administer daily Days 4 15 ( total 12 dos ) . All dos , include 31001074 paroxetine administer time ( approximately 8 ) , except Day 13 , paroxetine administer 30 minute ( approximately 7:30 ) administration 31001074 .</detailed_description>
