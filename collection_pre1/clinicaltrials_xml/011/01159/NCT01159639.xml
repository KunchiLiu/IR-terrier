	<brief_summary>Reactive platelet hyperactivity follow coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) might lead thrombotic complication major ischemic cardiac event . The aim study evaluate change platelet reactivity follow CABG clarify potentially beneficial effect dual antiplatelet therapy group patient document aspirin resistance follow CABG . Platelet function assess multiple electrode aggregometry . Aortocoronary vein graft disease comprise three distinct interrelate pathological process : thrombosis , intimal hyperplasia atherosclerosis . Early vein thrombosis major cause vein graft attrition first month CABG . Bypass patency improve antiplatelet therapy mainstay treatment patient CABG . A beneficial effect acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) vein graft patency previously show . Some patient experience thrombotic event despite continuous aspirin administration CABG . The investigator hypothesize low responsiveness aspirin might precipitate factor adverse thrombotic event follow CABG . Low responsiveness ASA , assess platelet function test , varies widely among patient . The etiology postoperative platelet hyperactivity remain elucidated . In study new point-of-care assay name multiple electrode aggregometry ( MEA ) use device call Multiplate analyzer ( Dynabyte , Munich , Germany ) utilize . It allow rapid standardized assessment platelet function parameter . This prospective randomize trial . The aim study document whether introduction dual antiplatelet therapy patient ASA resistance lead low incidence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) six month follow . The composite endpoint include death , non-fatal myocardial infarction , stroke cardiac rehospitalization . All patient receive 300 mg ASA start 6 hour surgery , provide chest tube output minimal . On postoperative day 4 platelet function assess use mention MEA . The patient find aspirin resistant undergo process randomization . The first arm include patient ASA resistance additional antiaggregation administer . In second arm investigator include patient randomize receive 75 mg clopidogrel addition standard antiplatelet regimen 300 mg ASA . Platelet function monitoring allow individual tailor antiplatelet therapy . The goal study define whether strategy lead improve patient outcome . Both major minor bleed complication strictly monitor report .</brief_summary>
