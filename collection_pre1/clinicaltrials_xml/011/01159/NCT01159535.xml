	<brief_title>Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention : Efficacy Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapse alcohol drug use ( AOD ) follow treatment continue costly problem individual , society , substance abuse treatment community , thus warrant continue development innovative efficacious intervention design prevent AOD relapse . Mindfulness base relapse prevention ( MBRP ; Bowen , Chawla , &amp; Marlatt , 2008 ) one promise intervention : incorporates mindfulness meditation foundation cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention ( RP ; Daley &amp; Marlatt , 2006 ) . RP establish substance abuse treatment , yet treatment developer , believe RP continue enhance . Based result initial pilot trial , MBRP demonstrate feasibility empirical promise aftercare treatment AOD disorder enhance long-term behavior change reduce risk relapse related consequence . In proposed study , MBRP RP compare treatment usual ( TAU ) deliver Recovery Centers King County ( RCKC ) , population individual receive community-based intensive inpatient ( IP ) outpatient ( IOP ) treatment . RCKC community treatment agency provide range addiction treatment service previously support effort recruit retain sufficient number target population . The propose study examine whether structured mindfulness practice result few AOD use day fewer problem related AOD use compare TAU longer-term followup previous pilot study . Given high prevalence AOD abuse population high rate relapse follow AOD treatment , propose research provide valuable next step evaluate efficacy MBRP aftercare treatment AOD disorder understand mechanisms treatment efficacy . To knowledge , prior substance abuse treatment study evaluate effect add mindfulness-based component ( e.g. , MBRP ) exist empirically support treatment ( i.e. , RP ) .</detailed_description>
