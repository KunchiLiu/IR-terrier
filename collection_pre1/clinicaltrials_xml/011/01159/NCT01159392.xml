	<brief_summary>Development acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) patient severe brain injury associate poor outcome . The application lung recruitment maneuver ( RM ) short period time open collapse alveoli reverse hypoxemia early ARDS recommend . However , little known cerebral vascular effect RM brain injury patient ALI/ARDS . The aim study assess effect single standardize RM oxygenation systemic cerebral hemodynamics severe brain injury patient ALI/ARDS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients severe brain injury comprise significant portion admission critical care unit . These patient unable adequately protect airway usually intubate mechanically ventilate . The goal mechanical ventilation patient brain injury optimize blood gas exchange minimize intrathoracic pressure avoid interference cerebral venous drainage.Over last 20 year , plethora experimental clinical data show mechanical ventilation cause aggravate lung damage patient acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . The aim pilot study assess effect single standardized recruitment maneuver ( RM ) oxygenation systemic cerebral hemodynamics severe brain injury patient ALI/ARDS . Only patient brain injury , define Glasgow Coma Score &lt; 13 , admit Trauma Surgical intensive care unit ( ICU ) study . After obtain informed consent , RM perform switch ventilator assist/control ventilation continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) apply pressure 40 cmH2O 40 sec ( 11 ) . After RM , patient ventilated pressure control ventilation PEEP gradually reduce decremental step every 3 respiratory cycle start PEEP 30 cm H2O , maintain maximum peak pressure 40 cmH2O procedure pre-RM PEEP level achieve . The RM discontinue follow change develop procedure : ( ) ≥20 % change baseline systemic blood pressure , ( ii ) ICP ≥20 mmHg , ( iii ) SaO2 ≤90 % . After RM perform , respiratory mechanic , arterial SjO2 blood sample systemic cerebral hemodynamics obtain 30 min 8 hour .</detailed_description>
