	<brief_summary>Lung cancer worldwide lead cause cancer death . In France , 28,000 new case per year , lung cancer 4th term incidence remain leading cause cancer death . The 5-year survival lung cancer , stag type , low , estimate 12 % among men 16 % among woman France . In advanced unresectable non small cell lung cancer , standard treatment relies platinum-based induction chemotherapy . The median progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient respond stabilize 4 chemotherapy cycle range 2 2.8 month . Gustave Roussy Curie institute develop immunotherapy involve metronomic cyclophosphamide ( mCTX ) follow vaccination tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cell-derived exosomes ( Dex ) . mCTX inhibits Treg function restore T NK cell effector function Dex able activate innate adaptive immunity . Phase I trials show safety feasibility Dex vaccine induction T cell could monitor patient . Since 2007 , validate new process isolation second generation Dex improve immune stimulatory capacity . We propose maintenance immunotherapy 47 advance unresectable NSCLC patient respond stabilized induction chemotherapy Dex-based treatment improve PFS rate 4 month patient .</brief_summary>
