	<brief_title>Studying Innate Immune Responses Infants With Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) cause spectrum illness healthy infant , range asymptomatic infection life threaten bronchiolitis respiratory failure . The reason difference clinical presentation remain unknown . Interferons natural antiviral factor component innate immune response , play role limit viral replication . We postulate difference clinical severity RSV infection may due innate immune difference production type I III interferon ( innate interferon ) . To test hypothesis , recruit infant mild , moderate severe RSV bronchiolitis compare production innate interferon blood respiratory sample , use quantitative functional analysis . We determine whether interferon response differ across spectrum clinical severity , relate viral load . To establish whether defect interferon production persist infant severe infection , retest follow recovery measure interferon response challenge live RSV . Demonstrating persist defect may suggest genetically determine defect require investigation . Identification mechanism severe disease patient without know risk-factors could lead target therapy prevent treat severe disease .</detailed_description>
