	<brief_summary>A Phase I trial weekly topotecan combination sorafenib treatment relapse Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) commence . In present randomized phase 2 study , investigator research whether Sorafenib maintenance prolongs progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient ED-SCLC achieved CR PR platinum-based induction chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Sorafenib Maintenance Patients With ED-SCLC After Response Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) comprise 10-15 % lung cancer . Despite high responsiveness initial chemotherapy , high relapse rate make treatment SCLC challenging . With platinum plus etoposide irinotecan , overall response rate high 85 % , however , median duration response short ( approximately 4 month ) , median survival time 9 11 month , 2-year survival rate le 10 % [ J Clin oncology . 2009 Oct 1 ; 27 ( 28 ) :4787-92 ] . New effective agent clearly need SCLC . Sorafenib multikinase inhibitor act pathway involve tumour progression angiogenesis , undergo investigation treatment SCLC either first- second-line setting . The data available far sorafenib , seem promising agent median survival 7 5 month platinum-sensitive platinum-refractory patient , respectively ( 2008 J Clin oncology 26 . Abstract 8039 ) . This compare favourably historical control receive salvage chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
