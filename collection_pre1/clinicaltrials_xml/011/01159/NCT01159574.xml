	<detailed_description>This phase II study treatment program patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma prior treatment lenalidomide . Up 54 patient enrol . Patients sign inform consent form fulfill eligibility criterion enrol . ClaPd therapy : Dexamethasone ( 40mg ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Clarithromycin give orally dose 500 mg twice day day 1-28 28 day cycle . Pomalidomide give 4mg daily day 1-21 28 day cycle . Serial clinic visit laboratory measurement perform monitor treatment response . Those patient demonstrate progression disease point ClaPd therapy take study . At end every cycle ( may coincide day 1 new cycle ) , response toxicity evaluate . During cycle 1 , patient labwork do weekly ( CBC differential blood electrolyte ) . All patient remain study disease progression side effect become excessive . Patients achieve stable plateau may take study eligible proceed high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation .</detailed_description>
