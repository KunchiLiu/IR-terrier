	<criteria>1 . Male female patient completely resect ( R0 resection ) , pathologically proven stage IB , II IIIA NSCLC . Patients allow receive adjuvant platinumbased chemotherapy treatment current NSCLC surgery enrolment . 2 . Written inform consent PRAME gene expression screen resect tumor tissue obtain patient prior shipment sample expression test , write informed consent complete study participation obtain performance protocol specific procedure . 3 . Patient &gt; = 18 year age time signature first inform consent form . 4 . The patient 's tumor show expression PRAME gene . 5 . The surgical technique resection patient 's tumor anatomical , involve least lobectomy sleeve lobectomy . The first ASCI administration give , either within 12 week surgery within 8 week day 1 last chemotherapy cycle within 32 week resection . 6 . The patient free metastasis , confirm negative baseline computer tomogram ( CT scan ) chest upper abdomen well CT scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain . These test perform within 6 week CT scan chest upper abdomen within 12 week brain CT scan MRI first ASCI administration . 7 . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . 8 . Adequate bonemarrow reserve , renal , adrenal hepatic function assess standard laboratory criterion 9 . Female patient nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define current tuballigation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . 10 . Female patient childbearing potential may enrol study , patient : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior study product administration , negative pregnancy test day administration , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion study product administration series . 11 . In view investigator , patient comply requirement protocol . 1 . The primary tumor remove segmentectomy wedge resection . 2 . The patient receive anticancer specific treatment , include radiotherapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy neoadjuvant chemotherapy , except treatment previous malignancy allow protocol . 3 .
