	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Low dose deferasirox may safe effective treating patient undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant iron overload . PURPOSE : This pilot clinical trial study safety tolerability deferasirox hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient iron overload . Effect low dose deferasirox labile plasma iron also examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Deferasirox Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Have Iron Overload</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine labile plasma iron ( LPI ) level iron overload patient allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( HSCT ) . II . To determine safety tolerability low dose deferasirox post allogeneic HSCT setting . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ability deferasirox suppress LPI allogeneic HSCT patient serum ferritin 1500 ng/ml . II . To determine prevalence elevate LPI allogeneic HSCT recipient serum ferritin 1500 ng/ml . III . To determine ability low dose deferasirox lower serum ferritin treatment period . IV . To correlate LPI serum ferritin allogeneic HSCT recipient serum ferritin 1500 ng/ml . OUTLINE : Patients receive deferasirox 10 mg/kg daily 6 month absence unacceptable toxicity . Labile plasma iron measure baseline week 4 , 12 , 24 . Side effect deferasirox record .</detailed_description>
