	<brief_summary>The first goal clinical research study find high safe dose BP1001 , liposomal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein-2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide ( L-Grb2 AS ) , patient Philadelphia Chromosome positive CML , AML , ALL MDS . The response leukemia treatment also study . The second goal clinical research study evaluate safety toxicity combination BP1001 concurrent low-dose ara-C ( LDAC ) patient AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial BP1001 ( L-Grb-2 Antisense Oligonucleotide ) CML , AML , ALL &amp; MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Philadelphia Chromosome unusual genetic trait find 90-95 % patient CML approximately 20-25 % patient ALL . The protein create unusual trait cause normal cell within body become cancer cell , cause cell grow divide rapid rate . Researchers think protein `` Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein-2 ( Grb-2 ) '' play important role rapid growth leukemic cell . The study drug ( BP1001 ) may able inhibit cell make Grb-2 . Researchers hope without protein , leukemia cell die . Up 60 patient expect enrolled study . Part A : Dose escalation : Each cohort receive BP1001 dose higher previous group . Part B : Dose-expansion Cohorts : Subjects relapse refractory AML receive escalate dos BP1001 concurrently fix low-dose ara-C ( LDAC ) The study drug antisense molecule complementary messenger RNA ( mRNA ) code cell 's expression protein Grb-2 . The study drug incorporate lipid ( fat ) particle know liposomes . This incorporation process part manufacture process do study drug administer . The liposome ( carry study drug ) administer intravenously twice week 28 day . Subjects enrol Part B study receive study drug twice week 28 day concurrently low dose ara-C , self administer twice daily 10 consecutive day .</detailed_description>
