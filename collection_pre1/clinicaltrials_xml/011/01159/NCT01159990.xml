	<brief_summary>HIV vaccine design create immune response certain component HIV virus call peptide . Previous research indicate one peptide , call Gag , may particularly important stimulate immune response HIV . Many vaccine study combine multiple peptide , include peptide may weaken body 's response Gag . This study test whether vaccine target Gag another peptide call Env good vaccine without Env cause immune response Gag .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV vaccine design create immune response certain part HIV virus call peptide . Researchers believe elicit response peptide call Gag particularly important . Most HIV vaccine current clinical trial combine multiple peptide , include peptide may cause antigenic competition . Antigenic competition occur body 's immune system reaction one part vaccine weaken inhibits response another part vaccine . Specifically , study concern many peptide vaccine might weaken specific immune response Gag . This study test whether vaccine include peptide Gag Pol elicit strong immune response Gag Pol vaccine also include peptide Env A , B , C. Participation study last 6 month . The number study visit vary study site . Participants randomly assign receive injection one two vaccine upper arm . One group participant receive rAd5 gag/pol , contain Gag Pol peptide , group participant receive rAd5 gag/pol Env A/B/C , contain Gag , Pol , Env A , B , C peptides . For 3 day injection , participant need record temperature side effect , contact study staff 7 day injection follow-up monitoring . During study visit , participant complete follow assessment : HIV test ; physical exam ; collection blood sample ; pregnancy test ; interview health , medication , HIV risk behavior , experience study . Participants contact study staff year 5 year vaccination follow-up health safety monitoring .</detailed_description>
