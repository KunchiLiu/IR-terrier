	<brief_title>Study Investigate Therapeutic Role RNA Fragments Platelet Production During Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelosuppressive chemotherapy potential produce life threaten neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia . All condition compromise therapeutic dosing impact survival well quality life . The introduction recombinant growth factor enable oncologist minimize prevent development treatment-induced anemia neutropenia , management chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia ( CIT ) remain major challenge . American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) guideline recommend dose reduction chemotherapy follow onset thrombocytopenia despite data show full dose , time , chemotherapy lead reduce tumor burden well overall survival [ 1-3 ] . Patients CIT experience potentially life threatening complication , delay treatment , poor outcome , consume inordinate amount health care resource supportive care [ 4 ] . Development agent ameliorates CIT would represent major breakthrough cancer treatment . Platelets anuclear cell particle release bloodstream megakaryocyte locate bone marrow . The differentiation megakaryocytes regulate intricate interaction specific cytokine growth factor [ 5 ] . Bone marrow stromal element also critical differentiation release platelet . Cancer chemotherapy often deplete stem progenitor cell involve platelet proliferation , lead diminution platelet temporary interruption platelet production last stromal element megakaryocytes regenerate . There several experimental agent target prevent thrombocytopenia . These investigational agent cytokine involve differentiation production platelet [ 6 ] . Currently , agent commercially available prevention thrombocytopenia Neumega , derivative IL-11 . Data Neumega ( Oprelekin ) indicate short duration chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia , toxicity profile prevent widespread introduction clinical setting . Overall , absence agent minimize reverse CIT continue severely limit many patient ' ability complete full schedule chemotherapy dose originally prescribe treat oncologist [ 1 ] . This study dose escalation trial investigate anti-thrombocytopenic benefit safety single strand RNA fragment . The short chain RNA fragment obtain controlled degradation prokaryotic RNA ribonuclease . Beljanski show RNA fragment act primer DNA synthesis vitro find variation method degradation yield different preparation prime deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) synthesis distinct tissue specificity . The RNA fragment use study , administer orally , localize bone marrow appear prime DNA replication stem cell result proliferation white blood cell platelet . Beljanski et al . report specific RNA fragment effective restore normal level circulate platelet follow drug induce thrombocytopenia [ 7 ; 8 ] . Demonstrating utility specific RNA fragment prevention treatment thrombocytopenia among cancer patient undergo chemotherapy especially attractive give absence side effect associated growth factor hormones . This trial investigate efficacy two RNA preparations—extracted , purify fragment accord Beljanski 's procedure—to ameliorate CIT : one derive E. coli second yeast ( eukaryote ) . RNA molecules present diet consider conditional essential nutrient condition physiological stress [ 9 ] . Purified RNA prepare various method find nutritional product hospitalize patient infant formula [ 9-11 ] . This clinical trial evaluate biologic effect various dos specially prepared 'primer ' RNA fragment platelet number cancer patient already develop thrombocytopenia undergo chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
