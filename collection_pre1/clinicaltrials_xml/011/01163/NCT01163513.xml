	<brief_title>Coronary Mortality South Asians : Aetiologic Prognostic Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary death rate among first-generation migrant South Asia high White majority population . Understanding relative contribution incidence case fatality overall coronary death rate allow preventive intervention target likely efficacious . We seek meta-analysing new data previously publish work identify systematic review publish literature . We combine study span different mode presentation coronary disease 'normal ' population suspect stable angina higher-risk patient diagnose ACS within national registry [ MINAP ] . Initially undertake retrospective cohort study use four new database ( The aetiologic healthy population study , Whitehall II Study ; The chest pain clinic cohort new-onset chest pain ; coronary angiography cohort ( ACRE ) acute coronary syndrome cohort , Myocardial Infarction National Audit Project ( MINAP ) . We define ethnicity accord UK Office National Statistics 1991 census category . All four cohort flag mortality Office National Statistics . We use combined non-fatal outcome ( non-fatal myocardial infarction admission angina ) aetiologic cohort , well risk coronary death . We assess risk coronary death chest pain clinic coronary angiogram cohort all-cause death acute coronary syndrome cohort cause-specific death unavailable . We assess prognosis coronary death Whitehall-II among typical angina baseline . We perform Cox proportional hazard regression adjust age ( continuous variable ) , sex , hypertension , blood cholesterol , smoke diabetes cohort . We stratify analysis prognostic study age , diabetes , ACS type , deprivation , smoke secondary prevention management formally examine whether statistical difference exist hazard ratio strata Bland-Altman two-tailed test interaction . We combine result new old study calculate pool odds ratio , weight , 95 % confidence interval use random effect model . Heterogeneity examine use I2 statistic .</detailed_description>
