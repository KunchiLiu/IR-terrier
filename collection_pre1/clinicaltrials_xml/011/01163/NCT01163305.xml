	<detailed_description>1 . To determine measure tumor metabolic response ( via FDG-PET scan ) &amp; circulate tumor cell ( CirTC ) 4 week start treatment , good predictor clinical outcome measure either modality alone patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) undergo first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy . 2 . To determine new method assess drug response ( measure tumor metabolic response via FDG-PET &amp; CirTC 4 week start treatment ) good predict clinical outcome conventional method ( measure radiological change tumor dimension 10 week start treatment via 'Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ' - RECIST ) .</detailed_description>
