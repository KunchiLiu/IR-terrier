	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Tasimelteon Compared With Placebo Totally Blind Subjects With Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder ( N24HSWD ) occur individual , primarily without light perception , unable synchronize endogenous circadian pacemaker 24-hour light-dark cycle , time circadian rhythm instead reflect intrinsic period endogenous circadian pacemaker . As result , circadian rhythm sleep-wake propensity individual move gradually later later day circadian period &gt; 24 hour earlier earlier &lt; 24 hour . These individual able sleep well night sleep-wake propensity rhythm approximately align 24-hour light-dark social cycle . However , short time , endogenous sleep-wake propensity rhythm 24-hour light-dark cycle move synchrony , may difficulty fall asleep well night . In addition problem sleep desired time , subject experience daytime sleepiness daytime nap . This multicenter , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled , parallel study . The study two phase : pre-randomization phase follow either randomization phase open-label extension ( OLE ) . The pre-randomization phase comprise screen visit subject 's initial eligibility evaluate , circadian period ( τ ) estimation segment , variable-length in-phase transition segment subject wait start treatment circadian phase align target bedtime . Subjects meet entry criterion study enter randomization phase . During randomization phase , subject ask take either 20 mg tasimelteon placebo approximately 1 hour prior target bedtime 26 week double-masked fashion . Subjects τ great 24.0 meet entry criterion ineligible randomization phase due τ estimate may give opportunity participate OLE phase . During OLE phase , subject take open-label 20mg tasimelteon 26 week .</detailed_description>
