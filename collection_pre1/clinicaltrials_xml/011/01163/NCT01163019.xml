	<brief_summary>Background : Chest pain ( CP ) suspect heart attack second frequent complaint among patient present emergency department ( ED ) . Present workup involve in-hospital observation 6 - 48 hour require significant resource include image test , invasive involve radiation radio-contrast agent , toxic kidney . CP result impair blood supply heart muscle , may result impaired contraction heart persist several day . Bedside echocardiography semi-automated speckle track strain analysis ( 2D strain ) novel promise noninvasive tool evaluation heart muscle contraction . 2D strain useful evaluate patient CP , since accurately detect minor impairment heart muscle contraction identify patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) impend heart attack ( coronary artery artery supply blood heart muscle ) . Working hypothesis aim : The investigator hypothesize bedside echo study normal 2D strain may allow quick safe rule heart attack significant CAD disease cause CP . The main aim study validate investigator preliminary finding large number patient order establish whether normal 2D strain safely rule heart attack life threaten CAD . Methods : In large multi-center study 1200 patient present ED acute CP unclear cause undergo echocardiography close possible presentation 24 hour cessation pain . Patients undergo standard workup ED physician . Standard echocardiographic finding , 2D strain analysis , make available attend physician . Data discharge letter , ECGs , blood test , stress test , nuclear imaging , heart CT heart catheterization collect . A 6-month follow-up telephone interview perform collect data survival , heart attack , re-hospitalization revascularization ( open heart vessel blockage ) . 2D strain analysis perform off-line central laboratory evaluate ability 2D strain distinguish patient CP heart disease patient without life threaten heart disease early release home safely . Expected result : The investigator expect , base investigator previous experience , patient normal 2D strain low probability heart attack significant CAD . The investigator expect patient excellent 6-month prognosis . This allow early cost-effective discharge . Importance Probable implication Medicine : Reduction ED patient load decrease unnecessary hospitalization CP . Cost resource saving elimination unnecessary imaging study , invasive involve radiation contrast agent .</brief_summary>
