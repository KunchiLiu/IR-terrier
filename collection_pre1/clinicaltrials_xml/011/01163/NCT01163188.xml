All probands assess previously , neonatally additional six time point , last time age 12-13 year . The focus identification risk , protective resiliency factor cognitive behavioural development quality life . On basis previously assess data statistical model child development age 8.5 year conduct across total range gestation 26-42 week identify social factor amenable intervention could associate positive development especially moderate prematurity . In addition , cross-validation finding plan mean comparison three international study ( Millenium Cohort , GB ; POPS , NL ; EPICure , GB ) . MRIs central nervous system conduct examine aberrant activation pattern `` attention network task '' stratify subgroup . Data driven MRI method evaluate relation clinical , behavioural developmental parameter . In line objective fund follow-up BLS answer important question regard health development small preterms .</detailed_description>
