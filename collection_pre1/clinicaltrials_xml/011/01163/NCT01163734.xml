	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study ranolazine patient heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) . Patients randomize receive ranolazine placebo 1.5:1 ratio ( 12 ranolazine : 8 placebo ) . Treatment consist intravenous infusion study drug follow oral treatment total 14 day treatment period . Study contact make approximately 14 day treatment period ass safety . Cardiac catheterization perform LV pressure hemodynamic measurement drug administration . Doppler ECHO , CPET , NT-pro-BNP determination perform screen end study . Adverse event safety lab monitor collect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Males female age &gt; 40 year 2 . Clinical symptom heart failure ( NYHA class IIIII ) time screen ( e.g. , dyspnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , orthopnea , bilateral low extremity edema ) 3 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 45 % screen 4 . With : E/E ' &gt; 15 measure Tissue Doppler echocardiography screen NTproBNP &gt; 220pg/mL screening Average rest LVEDP &gt; 18 mm Hg ( refer continue eligibility criterion ) , Average resting time constant relaxation ( tau ) &gt; 50 m time cardiac catheterization ( refer continue eligibility criterion ) 5 . Signed informed consent 1 . Acute cardiac decompensation require mechanical ventilation 2 . Hypotension blood pressure &lt; 90/50 mm Hg 3 . Primary hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy systemic illness associate infiltrative heart disease ( e.g. , cardiac amyloidosis ) 4 . Pericardial constriction 5 . Hemodynamically significant uncorrected obstructive regurgitant valvular disease 6 . Cor pulmonale cause right heart failure associate leave ventricular dysfunction 7 . Clinically significant pulmonary disease opinion Investigator require home oxygen oral steroid therapy 8 . History serious cardiac dysrrhythmias include atrial fibrillation rest heart rate &gt; 100 beat per minute 9 . Need treatment Class I III antiarrhythmic medication 10 . Implantable pacemaker , cardioverterdefibrillator , leave ventricular assist device 11 . Clinically significant chronic hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh Class B [ moderate ] Class C [ severe ] ) 12 . Severe renal insufficiency define creatinine clearance ≤30 mL/min calculate CockcroftGault formula Modified Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation . 13 . History congenital family history long QT syndrome , know acquire QT interval prolongation 14 . Inability exercise due comorbidities may affect performance cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) ( e.g. , osteoarthritis , peripheral vascular disease ) 15 . Current treatment potent moderate CYP3A inhibitor 16 . Current treatment potent CYP3A inducer ( e.g. , rifampin/rifampicin , St. John 's Wort , carbamazepin/carbamazepine ) 17 . Prior treatment ranolazine 18 . Other condition opinion investigator may increase risk patient ( e.g . pt weight ≤60 kg ) , prevent compliance study protocol compromise quality clinical trial Continued Eligibility Criteria : Patients must continue meet eligibility criterion average ( 3 measurement ) rest LVEDP &gt; 18 mm Hg rest tau &gt; 50 ms time cardiac catheterization receive study drug .</criteria>
