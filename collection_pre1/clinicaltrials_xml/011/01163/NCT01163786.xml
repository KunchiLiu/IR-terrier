	<brief_summary>Approximately 10,000 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) perform annually US various indication . Bronchiolitis obliterans ( BO ) common late noninfectious complication follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant . Prognosis BO allogeneic HSCT set dismal therapy proven consistently effective . The exact incidence clear may high 30 % 2 . Risk factor include new ongoing chronic graft versus host disease ( cGVHD ) , age , antecedent obstructive airway disease viral infections1 . BO characterize physiologically progressive irreversible airflow obstruction pathologically luminal occlusion distal airway due progressive scarring3 . The pathogenesis completely understood cytokine transform growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-b1 ) , important tissue repair fibrosis , think play pivotal role . Bortezomib , FDA approve proteasomal inhibitor inhibit TGF-b1 signal vitro protects lung injury/fibrosis bleomycin mouse model well mouse model skin fibrosis . This consistent data literature proteasomal inhibition prevent development fibrosis . Thus investigator propose test safety , tolerability efficacy bortezomib chronic pulmonary GVHD ( BO ) .</brief_summary>
