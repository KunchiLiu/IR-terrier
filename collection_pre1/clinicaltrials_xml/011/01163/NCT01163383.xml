	<brief_summary>Metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) substance take neuroblastoma pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumor cell . MIBG combine radioactive iodine ( 131 I ) laboratory form radioactive compound 131 I-MIBG . This radioactive compound delivers radiation specifically cancer cell cause die . The purpose research protocol provide mechanism deliver MIBG therapy clinically indicate , also provide mechanism continue collect efficacy toxicity data provide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>131-I-MIBG Therapy Refractory Neuroblastoma Metastatic Paraganglioma/Pheochromocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>131I-MIBG experimental , use 100 child United States treat relapse neuroblastoma metastatic pheochromocytoma/ganglioma . A recent study use increase dos 131I-MIBG child adult relapse neuroblastoma metastatic pheochromocytoma/ganglioma show anti-cancer effect patient . The main side effect treatment decrease number normal blood-forming cell ( call stem cell ) bone marrow , dose 12 mCi/kg cause permanent damage bone marrow small number patient . There certain test procedure need do confirm subject eligible therapy . These include lab work , physical exam MIBG scan . A CT scan , MRI , bone scan , Bone marrow aspirate biopsy urine test do evaluate disease status clinically indicate . Your doctor determine test require . Subjects need intravenous catheter ( tube ) place vein begin study treatment . An exist central venous catheter use administer medicine . Because subject ' urine radioactive , urinary catheter may insert ensure drainage urine , radioactive . The catheter remove 3-5 day follow treatment . General anesthesia sedation typically give procedure insert catheter . Subjects treat specially prepared room CHOP Pediatric Oncology Unit . Upon admission , nurse staff instruct caregiver care subject follow MIBG infusion . Because frequent exposure nurse staff radiation high level radiation surround subject therapy , nurse ' contact limit complex medical care , available subject event emergency . Adult family member expect present time hospitalization : - Assist hygiene - Give oral medication - Offer empty bedpan - Assist meal - Change diaper ( use ) - Change clothing bed linens soil - Entertain distract individual become upset restless due isolation procedure . - Record Dosimeter reading . Isolation : For 2-5 day subject place single room bed surround lead shield prevent exposure visitor hospital personnel radioactivity . Family member may visit room , must wear radiation badge measure exposure . A single family member sleep room , one allow go behind shields sleep bed child . Subjects receive fluid central venous catheter . The fluid begin least four hour continue least 72 hour 131I-MIBG treatment begin . Subjects take medicine mouth , potassium iodide , prevent thyroid damage radioactive iodine contain 131I-MIBG . This medication take day treatment continue total 6 week . The 131I-MIBG give intravenous catheter 1-2 hour . During administration drug , subject 's blood pressure heart rate check frequently . Before regular interval treatment , subject routine blood test check his/her blood count , hormone , liver kidney function . Blood check frequently first 1-6 week , 6 week treatment . Approximately 1 teaspoon blood drawn time first 6 week perform test list . An MIBG scan perform see drug concentrate body follow treatment . No injection radioactive marker require usually do day discharge . It identical pretherapy MIBG scan except need MIBG injection usually short ( 15-30 minute ) . Six eight week treatment , MIBG scan do evaluate response tumor treatment . If subject 's tumor respond stable 6-7 week treatment , may eligible second third course treatment , long white blood count recover treatment patient stem cell available need . If another MIBG treatment give , dose first treatment , unless think necessary safety reason ( base toxicity information first infusion ) decrease dose . If subject 's blood count decrease follow therapy , treatment Filgrastim ( G-CSF ) Neulasta may require . G-CSF/neulasta medicine help increase white blood cell . This give subcutaneous ( skin ) injection ( like insulin shot ) . GCSF give daily Neulasta give every 14 day instead GCSF . Neulasta work like GCSF help increase white blood count last long child 's body . This medicine start absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) , measure infection fight cell , go 750 continue rise 5000 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Refractory relapse neuroblastoma OR malignant Paraganglioma Pheochromocytoma Age great 1 year able cooperate radiation safety restriction therapy period . Performance Level : Patients must Karnofsky Lansky performance status equal great 50 percent Disease status : Failure respond standard therapy ( usually combination chemotherapy without radiation surgery ) development progressive disease time . Disease evaluable MIBG scan must present within 8 week study entry subsequent intervening therapy . The principal coinvestigator waive requirement intervene therapy judgment would pose undue risk would affect ability judge treatment effectiveness . Stem cell : Patients must hematopoietic stem cell product available reinfusion MIBG treatment dos least 12 mCi/kg . The recommended minimum quantity peripheral blood stem cell 1.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg . The minimum dose bone marrow 1.0 x 10^8 mononuclear cells/kg . If stem cell available , dose 131 IMIBG 12mCi/kg le . Prior Therapy : Patients may enter study without reinduction therapy recurrent tumor . Patients must fully recover toxic effect prior therapy . Subjects receive chemotherapy , cytokine therapy investigational agent , must fully recover toxic effect prior therapy . Liver function : Bilirubin ≤2x upper limit normal ; AST/ALT ≤10x upper limit normal Kidney function : Creatinine ≤3x upper limit normal Signed inform consent : The patient and/or patient 's legally authorized guardian must provide write informed consent participate expand access protocol . Exclusion criteria Patients disease major organ system would compromise ability withstand therapy , deem principal investigator treat subinvestigator . Because teratogenic potential study medication , patient pregnant lactate allow . Patients childbearing potential must practice effective method birth control participate study , avoid possible damage fetus . Patients hemodialysis Patients uncontrolled infection Exceptions eligibility criterion may allow approve principal investigator long exception compromise safety subject exception clearly document . Each protocol exception must review Institutional Review Board therapy initiate .</criteria>
