	<brief_summary>Diabetes mellitus ( DM ) metabolic disorder commonly encounter healthcare professional . Diabetic nephropathy one complication , become common cause end-stage renal failure Hong Kong . As March 31 , 2000 , total 1026 patient diabetes renal replacement therapy number steadily increase . According ADA guideline , screen diabetic nephropathy perform annual basis assess urine albumin excretion rate . Serum creatinine also measure diabetic patient regardless degree urine albumin excretion rate . Timed urinary collection cumbersome procedure patient simpler fast test maintains reasonable sensitivity call . A tool non-invasive able identify patient early nephropathy change would valuable . The skin find potential provide important non-invasive route diagnostic monitoring human subject wide range application . eZscanÂ® technology patent active electrophysiological technology use low level DC-inducing reverse iontophoresis , together chronoamperometry , evaluate behaviour tissue specific location body . This non invasive test potential tool screen diabetic nephropathy . The aim study compare eZscan standard method screen diabetic nephropathy patient type 2 diabetes mellitus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Assess Accuracy eZscan Study Screening Diabetic Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients type 2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic nephropathy identify clinical record approach interest participate study . Written inform consent obtain patient qualify accord eligibility criterion agree join study . Inclusion criterion : 1 . Male female age 21 75 year ( inclusive ) . 2 . Has confirm type 2 diabetes mellitus 3 . With without diabetic nephropathy base recent complication screen 4 . Written informed consent give Exclusion criterion : 1 . Has amputation arm leg 2 . Uses beta blocker drug know affect sympathetic nervous system 3 . Has electrical implantable device ( pacemaker , defibrillator ) 4 . Known sensitivity nickel standard electrode 5 . Sufferers epilepsy seizures 6 . Patients renal replacement therapy 7 . Patients chronic kidney disease due know non-diabetes cause e.g . renal stone obstructive uropathy . 8 . Patients confirm urinary tract infection day assessment . Primary endpoint : 1 . The optimal eZscan unit detect presence diabetic nephropathy define eGFR ACR use ROC analysis , sensitivity specificity value . Other analysis : 2 . A prediction algorithm use age , sex , body mass index eZcan score develop predict eGFR continuous categorical variable use Cox regression analysis . 3 . Students test analysis variance use compare eZcan value patient without diabetic nephropathy age sex adjustment Frequency adverse event also list .</detailed_description>
