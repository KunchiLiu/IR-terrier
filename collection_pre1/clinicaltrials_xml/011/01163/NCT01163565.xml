	<brief_summary>This randomize , prospective equivalence trial safety Ligasure Vessel Sealing System use thyroid surgery . The Ligasure system hand hold surgical device use heat seal blood vessel surgery . It test accepted technology abdominal surgery apply surgery thyroid gland faster traditional method tie blood vessel surgeon must manually . To remove thyroid gland safely surgeon must dissect gland away recurrent laryngeal nerve control vocal cord patient 's voice . Protecting nerve key step thyroid surgery damage permanently alter patient 's voice even obstruct airway . At time worldwide accept rate nerve injury 2 100 patient . The hypothesis study nerve injury rate surgery use Ligasure device similar see surgeon manually tie blood vessel . The investigator protocol evaluate function recurrent laryngeal nerve remove thyroid gland use Ligasure device comparison traditional method surgeon manually tie blood vessel . In study , patient undergoing total thyroidectomy benign condition , patient randomize one lobe thyroid ( left right ) remove use manual tying blood vessel side surgeon use Ligasure device seal blood vessel . Every patient pre− post−operative independent assessment vocal cord function use nasopharyngoscopy ensure vocal cord work normally prior surgery also document vocal cord dysfunction injury recurrent laryngeal nerve . The investigator intent show Ligasure system safe method seal vessel thyroid surgery thermal dispersion device pose significant increase risk recurrent laryngeal nerve</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Equivalence Trial Evaluate Safety Ligasure Thyroid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diathermy accept modality aid surgery maintain hemostasis use form surgery include head neck , neurosurgery general surgery . The Ligasure vessel seal system use heat energy approve use many different type surgery test accept use multiple country , include Canada . What test proposal application accept technology thyroid surgery . There one previous randomize trial examine Ligasure device thyroid surgery design look operative time bleed episode comparison manually tie blood vessel . It proven Ligasure device make operation quicker effective seal blood vessel manual tie surgeon . However , thyroid surgery injury recurrent laryngeal nerve important concern nerve close proximity gland . Damage nerve could temporarily permanently alter patient 's voice making hoarse . In study examine heat generate device could damage recurrent laryngeal nerve hold close enough prolonged time period . There case report indicate Ligasure safe study intend prospective , randomized manner prove use Ligasure system affect nerve injury rate compare surgeon manually tie blood vessel thyroid surgery . Our hypothesis use Ligasure vessel seal system thyroid surgery safe traditional manual tying blood vessel surgeon term injury recurrent laryngeal nerve . We propose randomize , prospective equivalence trail compare recurrent laryngeal nerve injury rate use Ligasure device manually tie blood vessel . The thyroid gland two lobe , leave right , lobe recurrent laryngeal nerve ( thus two per patient ) . With traditional manual tying vessel , approximately 2 % patient alter function one recurrent laryngeal nerve , expect rate alter function Ligasure patient cohort . To prove enroll patient benign thyroid disease , include multinodular goitre , Grave 's disease , thyroid nodule thyroiditis , total thyroidectomy . Excluded patient 18 known cancer well undergo reoperative surgery know recurrent laryngeal nerve dysfunction . The patient randomize computer dissection thyroid gland one side ( left right ) do traditional manual tying method side do surgeon use hand−held Ligasure device . The randomization process use random number generator assign patient number book operating theatre . This process independent surgeon know side use Ligasure day operation . After surgery independent assessment vocal cord nasopharyngoscopy do leave right side within 6 week surgery otolaryngologist blind surgical technique . This allow u determine either leave right recurrent laryngeal nerve injure . If injury link whether surgeon manually tie vessel side use Ligasure device . Sample size calculation equivalence trial base Blackwelder ( Controlled Clinical Trials 1982 ; 3:345−353 ) outline detect 5 % difference injury rate , set 2 100 , Ligasure traditional technique need complete dissection 96 patient ( patient one side Ligasure one side manual tying ) .</detailed_description>
