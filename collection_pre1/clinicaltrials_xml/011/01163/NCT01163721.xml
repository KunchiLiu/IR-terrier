	<brief_summary>This study enrol participant inadequately control type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) despite non-insulin antidiabetic therapy addition diet exercise , would benefit additional control blood glucose level . The study assess metabolic effect ranolazine , include effect lowering glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , lower glucose fasting , follow meal ( postprandial ) . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio receive ranolazine placebo , stratify HbA1c ≤ 7.5 % &gt; 7.5 % . Enrollment include two-thirds participant baseline HbA1c ≤ 7.5 % . Other glucose value , efficacy endpoint result remain blinded study ; safety purpose , investigator alert severe hyperglycemia hypoglycemia . Participants instruct maintain logs physical activity/exercise ( Subject Activity Assessment ) study drug dosing ( Dosing Log ) .</brief_summary>
