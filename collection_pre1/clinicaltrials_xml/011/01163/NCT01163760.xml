	<criteria>Be 21 39 year age . Signed Written Informed Consent Investigator record Case Report Form ( CRF ) appropriate space . Be exist ( i.e . successfully worn 1month prior study ) soft contact lens wearer ( extend wear last 3 month , silicone hydrogel daily wear allow ) . Require visual correction eye ( monovision allow monofit ) . Have contact lens spherical distance requirement 1.00D 6.00D eye . Astigmatism 1.00D less eye . Be able wear lens power available study . Be correctable visual acuity 20/30 good eye . Have normal eye evidence abnormality disease . For purpose study normal eye define one : No amblyopia . No evidence lid abnormality infection . No conjunctival abnormality infection . No clinically significant slit lamp finding ( i.e . edema , stain , scar , vascularisation , infiltrate abnormal opacity ) . No active ocular disease . Requires concurrent ocular medication . Any systemic illness would contraindicate lens wear medical treatment would affect vision successful lens wear . Clinically significant ( Grade 3 4 ) corneal edema , corneal vascularisation , corneal staining , tarsal abnormality , bulbar injection abnormality cornea would contraindicate contact lens wear . Diabetic . Infectious disease ( e.g. , hepatitis , tuberculosis ) immunosuppressive disease ( e.g. , HIV ) . Extended lens wear last 3 month . PMMA RGP lens wear previous 8 week . Has refractive surgery . Has eye injury/surgery within 8 week immediately prior enrollment study . Abnormal lacrimal secretion . Preexisting ocular irritation would preclude contact lens fit . Keratoconus corneal irregularity . Pregnancy , lactate plan pregnancy time enrollment . Participation concurrent clinical trial last 60 day . ''</criteria>
