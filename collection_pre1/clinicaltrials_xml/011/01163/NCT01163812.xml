	<brief_summary>Objectives study determine whether laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG ) complete D2 lymph node dissection gastric cancer safe effective surgical option . Methods : total 64 patient , diagnose preoperatively T1-2 , N0-1 M0 gastric cancer , prospectively enrol undergo LADG D2 lymph node dissection ; two surgeon experience 50 case laparoscopic gastrectomy perform procedure . The compliance rate , define case one miss lymph node station accord Japanese Research Society Gastric Cancer ( JRSGC ) lymph node grouping , open gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection 66.0 % pilot study use calculation sample size . Compliance rate surgical outcome , include number retrieve lymph node lymph node station , morbidity , mortality conversion rate analyze .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Laparoscopic D2 Gastrectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer common cancer Korea ; overall age-standardized incidence rate gastric cancer Korea report 69.6 per 100,000 among male 26.8 per 100,000 among female 2000 . Treatment modality resectable gastric cancer include endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) , laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy ( LAG ) conventional open gastrectomy . Laparoscopic cancer surgery report acceptable alternative open surgery patient colorectal cancer . However , gastric cancer , laparoscopic surgery yet validate , thus , perform limited number patient early gastric cancer ; due technical difficulty systematic lymph node dissection . For treatment advanced gastric cancer ( AGC ) , country include Korea Japan , gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection standard operation . With recent progress diagnostic technique , accumulation experience laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy ( LADG ) early gastric cancer increase interest better quality life , effort apply minimally invasive technique treatment AGC . However , clinical trial test oncological feasibility LADG D2 lymph node dissection . There one phase-II study evaluate whether morbidity associate LADG high open gastrectomy . Before indication LADG extend include patient advanced cancer , status surgical expertise complete D2 lymph node dissection require investigation use prospective clinical study design . If approach show feasible , randomized prospective clinical trial , compare survival surgical outcome , would next step validate technique group patient . This study perform accord Helsinki Declaration . The study approve Ethics Subcommittee National Cancer Center Research Involving Human Subjects ( . NCCCTS-2005181 ) . All patient provide write informed consent enter study . Sample size The sample size base alpha error 0.05 90 % power accept margin difference compliance rate 10 % base non-inferiority test . The target choose primary end point study . For patient underwent LADG D2 lymph node dissection , compliance rate—defined case one miss lymph node station accord guideline `` The Japanese Research Society Gastric Cancer '' ( JRSGC ) lymph node grouping,11,12—was set 55 % ; patient open distal gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection , 66 % , base pilot study . We perform pilot study determine compliance rate 100 case open distal gastrectomy D2 lymph node dissection enrollment start . When data use formula , total sample size require determine 60 patient . When add 10 % expect follow-up loss , total sample size calculate 66 patient .</detailed_description>
