	<detailed_description>Asfotase alfa formerly refer ENB-0040 Hypophosphatasia ( HPP ) life-threatening , genetic , ultra-rare metabolic disease characterize defective bone mineralization impair phosphate calcium regulation lead progressive damage multiple vital organ , include destruction deformity bone , profound muscle weakness , seizure , impair renal function , respiratory failure . There approve disease-modifying treatment patient disease . There also limit data available natural course disease time , particularly patient juvenile-onset form .</detailed_description>
