	<brief_summary>The majority trans fatty acid consume general population derive product formulate use significant amount hydrogenate vegetable oil ( so-called industrial trans fat ) . Fat ruminant also contain small amount trans fatty acid , contribute , although small extent , total dietary intake trans fatty acid general population . The negative impact consume industrial trans fat health , particularly cardiovascular disease , increasingly recognize . Based data available date , currently possible conclude effect ruminants industrial trans fatty acid cardiovascular risk different . There therefore urgent need study compare impact naturally occur trans fatty acid dairy product trans fatty acid form industrial source cardiovascular risk factor well mechanisms action . The general objective study investigate impact naturally occur trans fatty acid dairy product ( mainly vaccenic acid ) plasma cholesterol level risk factor cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research undertaken double-blind randomize cross-over study accord Latin Square design , participant subject 4 consecutive isocaloric diet random order last 4 week . No stratification consider since population recruit relatively homogeneous . The 4 experimental diet : 1- diet rich ruminant TFA ( 8 g/day ) ; 2- diet moderately rich ruminant TFA ( 4 g/day ) ; 3- diet rich industrial TFA ( 8 g/d ) ; 4- control diet ( minimal dietary TFA industrial ruminant source ) . The source ruminant TFA come butter cream obtain modified regimen lactate cow fashion similar one used increase level conjugate linoleic acid ( CLA ) milk fat . Hydrogenated margarine use main source industrial TFA . Finally , butter obtain cow produce low level ruminant fat use formulate control diet ( minimal dietary TFA ) . All diet identical term menu , calorie macronutrient composition exception TFA source level . Minor difference level total saturate , monounsaturated polyunsaturated fatty acid match across diet add various vegetable animal oil . The macronutrient composition meal thus entire day similar across 4 diet . Based 2500 kcal/day regimen , intake TFA 8 g/d 4 g/d represent 72 kcal/day 36 kcal/day respectively ( 3 % 1.5 % energy intake ) . The 4 experimental diet formulate percentage daily calorie fat ( 36 % ) , carbohydrates ( 50 % ) proteins ( 14 % ) meet dietary recommendation American Heart Association NCEP primary prevention CVD , exception SAT ( slight excess ) fiber ( slight deficit ) . The slight excess SAT fat avoid since use butter primary source ruminant TFA . The cholesterol content experimental diet exceed 300 mg/day .</detailed_description>
