	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) represent first cause mortality industrialized country Canada United States . In regard , increasingly recognize significant proportion CVD event may attributable presence cluster metabolic physiological perturbation define metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) . The National Cholesterol Education Program- Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEP-ATP III ) recently propose clinical definition identify individual MetS . This definition base presence least three follow five characteristic : 1- abdominal obesity , 2- hypertriglyceridemia , 3- reduced plasma HDL-C level , 4- high blood pressure , 5- high fasting blood glucose level . Recent data suggest MetS base definition associate 2 5 fold increase risk CVD men well woman . These alarm figure since suggest much 35 45 % female age &gt; 65 year US may MetS . It therefore imperative develop new preventive strategy efficacious attenuate impact MetS progress rate CVD woman . In context , accumulate evidence suggest milk dairy product may beneficially modify several component MetS . However , available data date base observational study interventional study minimal nutritional control . Thus , metabolically control study document impact milk consumption cardiovascular risk factor associate MetS woman define priori MetS utterly lack . The purpose study investigate impact milk consumption feature MetS menopausal woman present one feature MetS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research undertaken randomize , cross-over , nutritionally control study , participant subject two 6-week isocaloric diet separate 4-week washout period . No stratification consider since population recruit relatively homogeneous . The experimental diet ( design 'Milk ' ) formulate percentage daily calorie fat ( 30 % ) , saturate fat ( 10 % ) , carbohydrates ( 55 % ) proteins ( 15 % ) conform dietary recommendation American Heart Association NCEP primary prevention CVD , exception saturate fat ( slight excess ) fiber ( slight deficit ) . The cholesterol content experimental diet exceed 200 mg/day . The source dairy product experimental phase 2 % fat milk . We choose use 2 % fat milk frequently consume dairy product Canada . Two percent fat milk also go minimal processing compare milk dairy product yogurt cheese . Thus , bioactive component milk likely retain 2 % fat milk extensively processed product . The energy intake milk represent 20 % consume kcal/day . Based reasonable 2000 kcal/day regimen , 20 % intake attributable 2 % fat milk correspond 400 day/kcal , derive 'daily dose ' 3 portion milk/day . This dose show effective previous uncontrolled study . The Control diet virtually identical term menu , calorie macronutrient composition , exception milk formally exclude regimen . The energy intake change macronutrient composition attributable milk component experimental diet compensate control diet modify protein , carbohydrate lipid component various recipe . A 4-week stabilization run-in period precede randomization participant . During run-in period , participant ask instructed comply NCEP-ATP III prudent diet . They ask maintain body weight constant period . Milk consumption adapt period comply recommendation NCEP-ATP III . The washout period two experimental diet last 4 week also consist NCEP-ATP III recommend diet . It must stress food provide run-in wash-out period . These period impose minimize inter- intra-individual variability experimental phase .</detailed_description>
