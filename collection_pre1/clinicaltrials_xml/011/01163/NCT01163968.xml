	<brief_title>Maximizing Outcomes Needed After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Using Weight Management ( MOMENTUM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity independent risk factor coronary disease prevalent among patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The significance cardiac disease often underestimated patient undergo PCI , therefore reticent modify cardiac risk factor obesity follow PCI . This issue particularly problematic rural population , give weight reduction specific program often available rural community . The overall goal pilot study evaluate 12 week cognitive behavioral intervention weight reduction overweight obese PCI patient participate rural cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program . The Maximizing Outcomes Needed After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Using Weight Management ( MOMENTUM ) intervention comprise 6 module , total 52 daily session promote weight reduction , 4 coaching session duration 12 week MOMENTUM intervention . The MOMENTUM intervention deliver use telehealth method ( Viterion telehealth device use deliver module content telephone deliver coaching session ) . The intervention purposively design overcome access barrier use delivery mode accessible patient rural setting , home time convenient schedule . A randomized , 2-group , repeated measure experimental design use . Subjects PCI , overweight obese enroll rural cardiac rehabilitation program randomize either MOMENTUM group ( n=25 ) control group ( usual care ) ( n=25 ) . The primary aim study compare difference group weight reduction ( primary outcome ) , diet behavior physical activity ( secondary outcome ) time ( baseline , 16 week , 6 9 month PCI ) . The second aim study evaluate feasibility implement MOMENTUM intervention large randomize control trial . The innovation pilot study use technology deliver comprehensive cognitive-behavioral weight reduction program cardiac patient rural community otherwise might access specific weight reduction program improve cardiac risk profile acute cardiac event , PCI .</detailed_description>
