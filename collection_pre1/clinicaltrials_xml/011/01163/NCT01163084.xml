	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study give leuprolide acetate goserelin acetate together without vismodegib follow surgery see well work treat patient prostate cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antihormone therapy , leuprolide acetate goserelin acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body . Vismodegib may slow growth tumor cell . Giving antihormone therapy together vismodegib may effective treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leuprolide Acetate Goserelin Acetate With Without Vismodegib Followed Surgery Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess difference less equal 5 % tumor involvement patient two arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess difference hedgehog signaling , androgen signaling , marker link high grade prostate cancer ( PCa ) progression , proliferation , apoptosis , expression androgen produce enzyme tumor microenvironment two arm . II . To assess safety preoperative GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) combination luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) . III . To assess difference proportion patient negative disease surgical margin two arm . IV . To collect archive tissue primary tumor , bone marrow blood ( serum , plasma ) , bone marrow aspirate future study . V. To assess difference relapse rate ( biochemical , objective ) time progression . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( androgen-ablation therapy vismodegib ) : Patients receive LHRH analogue comprise leuprolide acetate intramuscularly ( IM ) goserelin acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( androgen-ablation therapy ) : Patients receive LHRH analogue comprise leuprolide acetate goserelin acetate Arm I . Treatment repeat every 28 day 16 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient undergo radical prostatectomy . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 8 year .</detailed_description>
