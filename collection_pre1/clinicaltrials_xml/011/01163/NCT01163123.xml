	<brief_summary>Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) one important zoonotic infectious disease Taiwan . JE cause Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) transmit Culex tritaeniorhynchus use swine amplify host . Infections lead overt encephalitis estimate 1 1000 case . Among JE confirm case , approximately 25 percent case die 50 percent survival develop permanent neurologic and/or psychiatric sequela . JEV circulate Taiwan belong genotype III vaccine strain select genotype . Genotype I JEV first detect northern Taiwan 2008 CDC , genotype JEV detect mosquito collected central Taiwan group . In order study genotypic shift JEV Taiwan area , effect replacement genotype vaccine , conduct JEV seroepidemiology Hualien county high incidence JEV Taiwan . The aim study : ( 1 ) study circulate genotype I JEV Hualien county ; ( 2 ) determine virulence genotype I JEV human ; ( 3 ) differential diagnosis JEV genotype I III infection among confirmed case ; ( 4 ) measure cross neutralizing activity , immunize genotype III JEV vaccine , genotype I JEV ; ( 5 ) determine age-specific seroprevalence JEV antibody ; ( 6 ) estimate annual risk infection JEV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Seroepidemiology Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection Hualien , Taiwan</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According CDC Taiwan epidemiology data , Hualien county 6 confirmed JEV infection patient 2009 witch high county Taiwan . Since mass vaccination arrange since 45 year ago Taiwan , JEV infection happen elderly , possible due age immune compromise . However , Mennonite Christian Hospital CDC record , confirm JEV patient Hualien county aboriginal people . The young patient 2009 around 30-year-old live mountain side aboriginal village . Whether aboriginal people risk JEV infection Genotype I JEV appear Hualien virulent , resistent vaccine protection unknown . In order understand risk JEV infection environmental ( mosquito , swine ) surveillance , arrange small cohort study 2 village . The 2 village locate middle Hualien direct distance around 20 KM . Both village several pig farm mosquito number summer high . Both village document JEV infection resident past 2 year . The first village near river ready entrance sea ( wetland ) many migrate bird appear summer every year . The residence mostly Han people . The seconds village locate closed central mountain Taiwan residence almost aboriginal people . In year 2010 , plan follow research : 1 . Collect mosquito 2 village since May.2010 RT-PCT method identify JEV genotype 2 . Collect serum swine 2 village identify JEV genotype 3 . Collect serum 312 residency 2 village May Sep 2010 detect sub-clinical infection rate . ( estimate sub-clinical infection rate = 2.5 % ) 4 . Identify JEV new diagnose patient 2010 . Since virus hardly detect RT-PCR virus isolation JEV infect patient , virus identify mosquito swine nearby may show indirect evidence JEV genotype . After compare 2 serum person summer 2 village , identify : 1 . The subclinical infection rate JEV ( genotype I III , depend JEV isolated mosquito ) 2 . Whether aboriginal people near central mountain risk people near wetland .</detailed_description>
