	<brief_title>Ultrasound Guided Cannulation Dialysis Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haemodialysis patient need two needle insert large surgically alter vein ( fistula ) surgical vascular graft/shunt every dialysis session . Some fistulas shunt may difficult insert needles others . As system colour cod `` traffic light '' patient place unit . A `` green light '' patient easy `` needle '' two needle majority staff within unit able connect patient dialysis machine . A `` red light '' patient reserve experienced staff within unit often timetabled work specific time present connect certain patient dialysis machine . `` Amber light '' fistula lie two extreme . Ultrasound ( US ) routinely use many hospital many dialysis unit access machine ass patient problem . Indeed central venous line insertion dialysis almost always perform US guidance since two large study area 2002 provide strong evidence US guide placement significantly reduce complication catheter placement reduction number attempt insertion . In addition National Institute Clinical Excellence UK provide evidence insertion time quicker although association statistically less convincing . Ultrasound offer advantage dynamic imaging without risk radiation exposure do office base procedure use portable equipment . Studies emergency department particularly paediatric care suggest US guidance improve speed accuracy cannulation peripheral vein intravenous access . We suggest US guided cannulation fistula might improve cannulation rate difficult fistula potentially reduce time require commence dialysis number local complication cannulation ( haematoma/aneurysm/infection ) . To knowledge US used cannulation guidance dialysis unit , although unit access machine . We therefore propose perform randomise control trial US guide cannulation fistula versus current practice ( blind cannulation ) ass effectiveness US control cannulation busy dialysis unit .</detailed_description>
