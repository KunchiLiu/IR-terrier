	<brief_summary>This project aim assess two different technique use position knee replacement implant surgery . The patient randomise receive either follow : 1 . The establish Navigation System ( gold standard ) 2 . The new Prophecy Technique ( validate Navigation System ) The study hypothesis difference gold standard Navigation system Prophecy technique relation placement knee implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophecy Guide Outcomes Total Knee Replacement Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee joint pain often cause reduce joint limb function . Total knee joint replacement procedure aim relieve pain help improve mobility . There continued development improvement knee implant design instrument require surgery assist accurate placement implant . These development reduce surgery time assist accurate positioning knee implant , lead well long term outcome . Navigation system computerise system currently use intraoperatively position Advance knee implant . The Prophecy technique pre-operative alignment technique . Patient undergo MRI CT scan use manufacture personalise cut block use intraoperatively position knee implant .</detailed_description>
