	<brief_title>Biomarkers Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All transplant recipient receive periodic monitoring drug level laboratory test assess adequacy immunosuppression allograft function . These perform recipient admit hospital transplantation complication acute rejection toxicity , recipient outpatient . 1 . Blood sample : Participants may ask provide research blood specimens regular clinical test , may collect 15 milliliter blood many 7 time within first year transplant , less often thereafter . The total volume collect take account patient 's height , weight age time collection . However , reason participant unable provide sample regular clinical test may collect another time . Participants ask provide sample indefinitely . This allow longitudinal assessment stability biomarker expression reflection clinical drug concentration repeat measurement . 2 . Saliva collection : Up 5 ml subject 's saliva collect four time , previous sample provide adequate information . Samples collect self-collection container time consent early possible consent obtain , stored room temperature Pediatric Transplantation Laboratory , 3344 Forbes Ave . In recipient available , genotyping result DNA saliva compare pair blood sample . Henceforth , saliva collection offer participant donate blood specimen genotyping . Salivary sampling consider acceptable alternative standard whole blood genotyping . A saliva sample collect patient patient 's parent guardian prefers option blood sampling . 3 . Collection urine , feces , bile : five ml body fluid collect sterile urine cup application proteomics technology . Collections may repeat four time , first specimen provide suboptimal information . 4 . Collection remain allograft standard care biopsy specimen , tissue explants : Any piece allograft biopsy deem residual pathologist subject gene array test . This occur participant schedule standard care biopsy , surgery . Genetic material extract small tissue amplify use several approach . 5 . Measurements : Biomarker expression evaluate mitogen antigen stimulation peripheral blood mononuclear cell . ( 1-3 ) . Briefly , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) extract whole blood Ficoll gradient separation , Thereafter , either mitogens phytohemaglutinin , pokeweed mitogen , phorbol-myristic acid-ionomycin , viral major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) peptide antigen , intact alloantigenic cell use stimulate recipient PBMC . Cellular response measure include limited express pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory marker , cytokine , proliferation , cytotoxicity , apoptosis .</detailed_description>
