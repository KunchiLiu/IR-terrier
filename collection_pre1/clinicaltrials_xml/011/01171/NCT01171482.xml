	<brief_title>Comparison Study Sorafenib 5-fluorouracil/Mitomycin Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most HCC patient diagnose advanced stage Korea , effective treatment strategy advance HCC establish . In particular , optimal treatment strategy extrahepatic well intrahepatic recurrence follow locoregional therapy ( e.g. , transarterial chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation therapy , percutaneous ethanol injection ) still challenge issue . Extrahepatic metastasis encounter frequently , problematic management HCC due increase survival effective locoregional treatment . The lung common site extrahepatic metastasis surgical resection pulmonary metastatic lesion may result improved survival select patient . Previous study suggest aggressive management include resection extrahepatic recurrence combine locoregional therapy intrahepatic HCC may offer long-term survival select patient recurrent HCC follow hepatectomy . Such aggressive strategy serious limitation clinical practice extrahepatic recurrence usually present multiple lesion . Systemic chemotherapy one commonly use treatment modality patient multiple extrahepatic metastasis . However , chemotherapy use either single combine cytotoxic agent provide limited benefit patient . The aim study compare efficacy sorafenib 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin HCC patient pulmonary metastasis whose intrahepatic tumor previously control repeat locoregional therapy initiation systemic chemotherapy . Outline : - Experimental arm ( FM group ) : Patients receive 5-FU IV continuously 10 hour day 1~6 mitomycin IV push day 1~4 . Treatment repeat every 28 day . - Active Comparator arm ( sorafenib group ) : Patients receive 2 tablet sorafenib ( 200 mg/tablet ) twice daily , orally continuous basis . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . During treatment period , patient study visit Day 1 every cycle ( every 4 week start study drug ) receive CT/MRI assessment every 2 cycle ( every 8 week ) . In event radiological progression confine liver , e.g . appearance new nodule liver area previously treat locoregional therapy , patient also treat locoregional therapy TACE local ablation long may still benefit treatment . If patient longer amenable locoregional therapy ( case untreatable progression ) , study stop best supportive care offer . This base investigator 's clinical judgment subject 's status .</detailed_description>
