	<brief_summary>Complex wound close primarily great risk complication . A new technique utilizing external tissue expansion hold promise rapidly decrease wound area . Facilitation rapid wound closure critical preventing wound complication . Hypothesis : Using Dermaclose Wound Management System ( Woundcare Technologies , Inc. , Chanhassen , MN ) complex wound able primarily close decrease time secondary closure decrease need secondary soft tissue coverage procedure , secondary soft tissue procedure require , use decrease size complexity secondary soft tissue procedure . Null Hypothesis : The Dermaclose system decrease need , dimension , complexity secondary soft tissue coverage procedure complex wound able primarily close .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Complex Wounds Using Constant Tension External Tissue Expander</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upon IRB approval , 50 patient complex soft tissue wound , without associate fracture close primarily Dermaclose device apply prospectively follow 1 year . The Dermaclose device apply accord manufacturer 's guideline . This device may combine use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy . Primary secondary end point initially intend include list . However , SF12 pain outcome measure collect report . Initially Intended Primary end point ( SF12 collect report ) : SF12 1 . Initial final wound dimension 2 . Secondary soft tissue coverage procedures 3 . Dimensions type secondary soft tissue coverage procedure require compare initial wound dimension 4 . Method wound closure 5 . Days wound closure 6 . Number types procedure require wound closure 7 . Infection require reoperation 8 . Wound dehiscence require reoperation Initially intend Secondary end point ( # 3 collect report ) : 1 . Superficial wound dehiscence require reoperation 2 . Superficial wound infection require reoperation 3 . Visual Analog Pain Scale ( VAS ) Dermaclose use 4 . Use negative pressure wind therapy 5 . Cost-to-benefit ratio Dermaclose use - hospital day , number procedure , procedural hospital cost include device , negative pressure wound therapy cost , operate room time associate cost Patients evaluate daily inpatient hospital stay VAS relate wound Dermaclose device use . If Dermaclose device use outpatient basis , patient ask complete daily VAS time monitor pain associate device use . After hospital discharge , patient evaluate 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month . They complete SF-12 part evaluation . Patients may evaluate frequent interval need arises . Primary secondary endpoint evaluate time point .</detailed_description>
