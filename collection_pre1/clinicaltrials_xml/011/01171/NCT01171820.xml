	<brief_title>SPIRIT V : A Clinical Evaluation XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System Treatment Patients With de Novo Coronary Artery Lesions ( Diabetic Sub-Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SPIRIT V Clinical Evaluation consist two concurrent study , Diabetic sub-study Registry . The SPIRIT V Diabetic sub-study prospective , randomize , active-controlled , single blind , parallel two-arm multi-center study compare XIENCE V® EECSS TAXUS® Liberté™ treatment diabetic patient coronary artery lesion fulfill eligibility criterion . Approximately 300 patient randomize ( 2:1 ) TAXUS® Liberté™ coronary stent system . These patient recruit 40 select site . The long term safety efficacy XIENCE V EECSS demonstrate SPIRIT FIRST trial 5 year , SPIRIT II trial 4 year , SPIRIT III Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) 3 year . In addition , pre-approval study show low rate Target Vessel Failure Major Adverse Cardiac Events ( MACE ) observe plateau gradually decline 1 year consistently low comparator arm study . This benefit MACE sustain 5 year also independent first year result . The post approval SPIRIT V study demonstrate use XIENCE EECSS complex lesion real-world population result 1 year MACE , Stent Thrombosis Target Lesion Revascularization rate comparable previously mention pre-approval study include patient restrict inclusion / exclusion criterion . Therefore , base exist data trial , Abbott Vascular decide discontinue follow SPIRIT V Diabetic study 1 year .</detailed_description>
