	<brief_title>VA106483 Dose Response Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturia , define wake void least per night period sleep , common complaint show age-dependent increase prevalence severity ( number nocturnal void ) . The common cause detrusor over-activity , reduce nighttime functional bladder capacity , nocturnal polyuria . VA106483 selective vasopressin V2-receptor agonist development nocturia . VA106483 non-peptide drug display much improve oral availability desmopressin low dependence glomerular filtration elimination . VA106483 administer 184 subject ( include healthy adult subject [ male female ] , child [ male female ] nocturia 48 elderly male [ age 65 year ] ) . It administer single dos intravenously , dose approximately 250 mg orally 50 mg It also investigate approximately 123 male subject ( two-thirds active medication , one third placebo ) nocturia current study dose 8 week . This intra-subject dose escalation study previously conduct 10 elderly male subject determine whether subject demonstrate dose-dependent pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic ( urine osmolality diuresis ) response whether dose VA106483 could titrate within individual patient achieve optimal clinical response clinical practice . Given date , 8 female expose VA106483 , purpose study confirm describe duration pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics VA106483 male similar female .</detailed_description>
