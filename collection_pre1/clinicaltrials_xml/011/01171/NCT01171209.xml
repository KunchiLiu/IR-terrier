	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Interferon-alfa effective safe multiple sclerosis patient develop neutralize antibody Interferon-beta .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>REsPonse Interferon-Alpha InterfeRon-β Neutralizing Antibody Positive Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient NAbs develop IFN-β therapy longer beneficial effect IFN-β preparation IFN-β replace another therapy may less effective carry along serious adverse effect . Hence , many NAb positive patient wish continue IFN therapy , patient might benefit treatment IFN-α IFN-α IFN-β type I interferons bind interferon receptor ( IFNAR ) . A full vivo response human IFN-α ( Multiferon ) comparable see IFN-β induction would suggest therapeutic effect could obtain human IFN-α ( Multiferon ) .We measure vivo response MxA 9-12 hour administration human IFN-α ( Multiferon ) four know IFN response marker measure rt-PCR . As control , NAb negative MS patient full vivo MxA response study .</detailed_description>
