	<brief_summary>Polymyositis ( PM ) , dermatomyositis ( DM ) inclusion body myositis ( IBM ) belong group inflammatory muscle disorder , unknown cause , characterise skeletal muscle inflammation progressive muscular weakness , debilitate chronic nature ( occasionally fatal ) . The current treatment option condition steroids various immunosuppressive drug . However , usually partially effective reducing symptom , toxic side effect also limit usefulness . In order develop specific treatment myositis future ( therefore effective ) , important understand exact mechanism cause disease first instance . In similar inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) systemic lupus ( SLE ) , know change Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) , well certain inflammatory cytokine , involve development expression disease . As many inflammatory mechanism cause damage PM , DM IBM similar RA SLE , seem likely similar genetic factor also involve development expression PM , DM IBM . In order understand genetic aspect / cause myositis , ultimately develop effective treatment therapy future , patient PM , DM IBM , ask give 20 ml blood . These blood sample , along patient 's clinical detail , send Centre Integrated Genomic Medical Research ( CIGMR ) , The University Manchester , genetic analysis take place . By understand genetic cause disease , possible design specific drug treat condition future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Genes Patients With Polymyositis Dermatomyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order understand genetic aspect / cause myositis , ultimately develop effective treatment therapy , necessary collect blood sample clinical detail around 1000 patient myositis . As condition rare , possible get require number patient one centre alone , therefore , collaborative , multicentred approach need . Consultant rheumatologists neurologist throughout UK , patient PM , DM IBM , approach , ask would like officially enter myositis genomic multicentred study . Once ethical R &amp; D approval grant , consultant name 'Principal Investigators ' 'research site ' could start recruit suitable patient study . Patients research site , definite PM , DM IBM , ask consultant ( Principal Investigator ) give 20 ml blood via venepuncture genetic antibody analysis . The PI also complete clinical/laboratory proforma , patient , regard disease characteristic , allow subsequent confirmation patient ' disease indeed definite , proforma blood sample send CIGMR . All genetic analysis , take place CIGMR , storage clinical detail certain patient identifier store SRFT password protect NHS tust computer . This study coâˆ’ordinated Dr RG Cooper Rheumatic Diseases Centre , Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust ( SRFT ) , Professor Bill Ollier Centre Integrated Genomic Medical Research unit ( CIGMR ) , Stopford Building , Manchester University .</detailed_description>
