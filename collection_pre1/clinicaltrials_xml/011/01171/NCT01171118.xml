	<brief_summary>The investigator attempt demonstrate decrease frequency severity sedation-induced respiratory arrhythmia ( central obstructive apnea ) pharmacological pre-treatment pilot project eventually understand mechanism behind decrease . The efficacy mechanisms treatment , evaluate sleep Obstructed Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) patient , systematically study sedation either normal subject OSA patient . The agent assess study physostigmine versus placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One serious side effect drug administer sedation untoward respiratory event . The relative prevalence event think high , occur 41 % patient cohort . Many specific drug combination recommend moderate sedation , particularly provide non-anesthesiologist . The use opioid benzodiazepine frequent combination , partly availability antagonist drug may make `` rescue '' easy . However , combination result frequent respiratory arrhythmia ( combination obstruction , pause change respiratory pattern ) .There comprehensive study mechanism underlie disruption respiratory rhythm cause agent commonly use moderate sedation . This specific research , line research open , potential make administration anxiolytic analgesic safer patient high risk respiratory event .</detailed_description>
