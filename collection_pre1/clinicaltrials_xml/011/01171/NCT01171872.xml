	<brief_summary>The cause inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , unknown diagnose often difficult . This research do find gene may increase risk inflammatory bowel disease , identify specific protein substance related IBD . The investigator also look cell factor may predict response treatment IBD . In IBD , cell gastrointestinal tract ( gut ) seem respond certain substance normal way . Scientist discover immune system , make cell chemical defend body infection , work way damage wall gut . You ask join study go surgical procedure perform related diagnosis Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis medical reason ( comparison purpose ) . If join study , investigator study cell resect tissue gut find cell act normal way people IBD compare people without IBD . The investigator understand differently cell work , good doctor scientist able someday help people IBD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) —Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) —are chronic , frequently disable disease gastrointestinal tract . CD UC estimate combined prevalence 0.2 % 0.3 % United States , two eight time prevalent Jewish Americans Central Eastern European descent ( Ashkenazi Jews ) compare non-Jewish Americans . CD may involve part gastrointestinal tract , often colon terminal ileum . Bowel inflammation discontinuous , transmural , may contain granuloma . CD also associate bowel stenoses intestinal perianal fistula . UC , contrast , involve continuous , non-granulomatous inflammation colon rectum , limited mucosal layer . Fistulas observe . Colonic disease clearly identify CD UC designate `` indeterminate colitis '' . IBD prevalence ~ 0.2 % Western population . In United States alone , million diagnose IBD patient . IBD result enormous suffer health-care cost . In addition , repeat GI inflammation put individual increase risk develop colon cancer . Although currently variety clinical treatment alleviate symptom IBD patient , increase therapeutic option develop result ongoing research , cure disease . In addition , long-term usage current therapy , glucocorticoid immunosuppressive agent , associate serious side-effects . Progress make recent year understand pathological mechanism IBD , particularly search IBD susceptibility gene . However , due extreme complexity disease , still long way ahead elucidate detailed molecular mechanism IBD pathogenesis identify effective therapeutic target . Therefore , goal research study discover biomarkers protein factor involve pathogenesis IBD may pave way identification effective therapeutic target . Hypothesis : In addition exploration differential gene expression use microarray technology , investigator wish identify protein factor involve pathogenesis IBD . Initial proteomic study IBD patient ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) propose . The hypothesis test , identify protein differentially express modified IBD v normal intestine , investigator increase current understanding pathogenesis IBD associate diarrhea . Using 1-D 2-D gel electrophoresis , mass spectrometry , Western blot screening , preliminary study demonstrate 1 ) large number protein differentially express IBD intestinal mucosa v normal mucosa . Some protein identify , 2 ) three membrane transport protein , Na+/H+ exchanger 3 ( NHE3 ) , ClC Cl- channel 5 ( ClC5 ) Na+/K+-ATPase , significantly down-regulated IBD mucosa , suggest potential explanation IBD-associated diarrhea . The investigator propose extend preliminary study two specific aim . AIM 1 . Identify protein change expression post-translational modification intestinal mucosa patient active UC CD compare ) uninvolved intestinal mucosa patient , ii ) normal intestinal mucosa control subject , iii ) infectious/Inflammatory colitis ( C. difficile colitis ) . To increase chance identify change relatively low abundant protein , investigator first separate total cellular proteins several subfractions accord detergent-solubility size protein complex . Protein expression modification analyze either 1-D/2-D gel/DIGE/MS technology ( DIGE , Differential Image Gel Electrophoresis ; MS , Mass Spectrometry ) , electrospray LC-MS/MS ( liquid chromatography MS/MS ) , either total mucosa , villus crypt cell lamina proprial cell isolate laser capture microdissection ( LCM ) . AIM 2 . Identify change expression intestinal membrane transporter Na absorption Cl secretion , include NHE3 , intestinal mucosa patient active UC CD compare ) uninvolved intestinal mucosa patient , ii ) normal intestinal mucosa control subject , iii ) infectious/Inflammatory colitis ( C. difficile colitis ) . Transporters interest identify use large-scale targeted screening Western blot analysis . The targeted screening also include several intestinal epithelial brush border-associated PDZ-containing protein recently show regulate trafficking activity membrane transporter . The ultimate goal identify therapeutic target cure IBD alleviate symptom IBD .</detailed_description>
