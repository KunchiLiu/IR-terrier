	<detailed_description>Introduction Bone marrow angiogenesis increase multiple myeloma ( MM ) important prognostic factor survival . Newly diagnose MM patient higher microvessel density ( MVD ) control bone marrow biopsy . In addition , patient higher MVD , receive conventional chemotherapy high-dose therapy autologous stem cell transplantation , short median overall survival lower MVD use median MVD cutoff . In study 81 patient MM treat thalidomide without dexamethasone , MVD decrease significantly responder significant change MVD see fail respond thalidomide . Microcirculation variables derive dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance ( DCE-MR ) imaging , i.e . maximum enhancement exchange rate constant , correlate well histologic infiltration grade , MVD serum marker disease activity . Recently , maximal amplitude lumbar bone marrow enhancement DCE-MR examination identify prognostic variable event-free survival ( EFS ) progressive MM . These parameter may serve non-invasive surrogate biomarkers determine prognosis assess treatment response myeloma patient . However , study use technique limited maximal 400-mm field view , whereas myeloma involve bone marrow focally , diffusely throughout body , even outside marrow space . With advancement MR technology , unenhanced whole-body MR image proven reliable radiological skeletal survey whole-body multidetector compute tomography patient MM . Recently , whole-body single-phase contrast-enhanced sequence apply combination unenhanced sequence detection myeloma lesion . However , single-phase post-contrast MR examination provide detailed enhancement curve , limitation possibly hinders assessment disease activity . On hand , segmental dynamic MR examination enable assessment dynamic enhancement focal lesion different bone marrow segment . That reason lead u develop dynamic contrast-enhanced whole-body magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-WB-MRI ) protocol , never explore MM . The treatment patient MM largely palliative , advent high-dose melphalan , high rate complete response ( CR ) could obtain . For previously untreated patient age 70 year ( amendment n°5 ) young , high-dose therapy ( HDT ) follow treatment ( amendment n°3 ) growth-factor-mobilized peripheral-blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) demonstrate superior conventional chemotherapy high CR rate also significantly extend EFS overall survival . Recently , International Myeloma Working Group propose new uniform response criterion facilitate precise comparison new evolve treatment strategy . As functional image provide parameter related angiogenesis disease activity MM , DCE-WB-MRI might provide additional information prognostically important microcirculation variable whole-body scale . It might also prove helpful assess treatment response treatment strategy decision patient oligo- nonsecretory disease . Study Description : Treatment regimen : HDT follow ASCT PBSCs give . The ASCT condition high-dose melphalan ( HDMel ) 200 mg/m2 without bortezomib follow actual guideline . Response assessment : clinical response assess day post-treatment MR examination record accord uniform response criterion . After completion HDT follow ASCT , patient follow every 4 month first two year every 6 month thereafter total least 5 year . An event define disease progression , relapse clinical CR/VGPR , death cause . DCE-WB-MRI schedule : three MR examination perform , first diagnosis initiation chemotherapy , second induction chemotherapy ASCT , third exam three month ASCT . The result DCE-WB-MRI influence treatment strategy . MR Criteria Responders : A satisfactory response DCE-WB-MRI define presence maximal percentage bone marrow enhancement 100 % . All focal lesion , present , must present early enhancement progressive , delay type maximal enhancement .</detailed_description>
