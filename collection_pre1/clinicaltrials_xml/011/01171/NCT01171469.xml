	<brief_summary>This single center Phase I study determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) autologous dendritic cell ( DCs ) load allogeneic brain tumor stem cell administer vaccination child adults recurrent brain tumor . Once MTD determine , conduct phase II study determine efficacy . Clinical trial utilize DCs immunotherapy demonstrate significant survival benefit patient exhibit robust immune response tumor cell . Unfortunately , present time majority tumor patient unable mount adequate immune response thus succumb tumor . We postulate inability generate appropriate immune response patient due lack sufficient number appropriate T cell due inadequate source tumor antigen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination With Dendritic Cells Loaded With Brain Tumor Stem Cells Progressive Malignant Brain Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autologous DCs obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) patient leukapheresis . An establish BTSC line use allogeneic source tumor antigen . Approximately 4 week require leukapheresis vaccine production first vaccine administration . Each patient receive injection DCs his/her assign dose every 2 week first 8 week , follow injection every 4 week additional 10 vaccination . Imiquimod apply vaccination site prior 24 hour vaccine administration . This study use accelerate dose escalation design ( 1 subject per level ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) encounter , traditional phase I design ( 3 subject per level ) implement . DLT define grade 3 great treatment related toxicity . A total 6 patient treated maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , absence DLT , dose level 3 .</detailed_description>
