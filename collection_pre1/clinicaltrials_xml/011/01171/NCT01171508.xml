	<detailed_description>An increase number study show circadian variation excretion hormone , sleep-wake cycle , core body temperature , tone autonomic nervous system activity rhythm important health disease process . More attention pay towards circadian variation endogenous rhythm relation surgery whether affect postoperative recovery , morbidity mortality . Studies do circadian disturbance major minor surgery never relation breast cancer surgery . This study investigate circadian disturbance specific group patient use Actigraphy , Polysomnography ( PSG ) , Holter-monitoring ( HRV ) , primary metabolite melatonin urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin ( aMT6s ) , questionnaires sleep-diary .</detailed_description>
