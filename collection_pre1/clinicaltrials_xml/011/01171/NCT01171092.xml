	<brief_title>A Safety Study Looking Combination Velcade G-CSF Patients With Myeloma Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study plan use VELCADE two dos follow G-CSF give 4 dos standard mobilization G-CSF alone . The rationale VELCADE prior G-CSF VELCADE cause thrombocytopenia , similar cyclophosphamide give follow G-CSF stem cell mobilization . Usually cycle VELCADE myeloma therapy consist 4 dos , may result significant drop platelet count . Low platelet count may preclude adequate stem cell collection . The mobilization VELCADE GCSF approximately 3 -4 week completion initial therapy primary disease . Patients meet eligibility criterion give inform consent mobilize use bortezomib 1.3mg/m2 day -11 day -8 . Subsequently G-CSF administer subcutaneously day -4 day -1 daily injection standard /established dose 10mcg/kg . Stem cell collection do day 0 per standard care regimen protocol process 4 -5 blood volume . Stem cell enumeration flow cytometry do prior collection flow cytometry . The number CD 34 positive cell ( stem cell phenotype ) / kg obtain day collection note . G-CSF continue daily adequate number stem cell obtain performance single autologous transplant ( &gt; 2.5 million CD 34 cells/kg weight . Subsequently data engraftment neutrophil platelet monitor routine patient undergo autologous transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Female subject either postmenopausal least 1 year screen visit , surgically sterilize childbearing potential , agree practice 2 effective method contraception time sign informed consent form 30 day last dose VELCADE , agree completely abstain heterosexual intercourse . Male subject , even surgically sterilize ( ie , status post vasectomy ) must agree 1 following : practice effective barrier contraception entire study treatment period minimum 30 day last dose study drug , completely abstain heterosexual intercourse . &gt; 18 yrs age need undergo autologous blood stem cell transplant treatment multiple myeloma lymphoma Exclusion Criteria Patients meeting follow exclusion criterion enrol study . Patient platelet count &lt; 100x 109/L within 14 day enrollment . Patient absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.0x109/ within 14 day enrollment . Patient &gt; 1.5 x ULN Total Bilirubin Patient calculate measured creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/minute within 14 day enrollment . Patient ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . Patient hypersensitivity VELCADE , boron mannitol GCSF Female subject pregnant lactating . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Female patient lactate positive serum pregnancy test screening period , positive urine pregnancy test Day 1 first dose study drug , applicable . Participation clinical trial investigational agent include trial , within 14 day start trial 2 week patient receive last dose Velcade mobilization . Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . Treated VELCADE past 30 day Radiation therapy within 3 week randomization . Enrollment subject require concurrent radiotherapy ( must localize field size ) defer radiotherapy complete 3 week elapse since last date therapy .</criteria>
