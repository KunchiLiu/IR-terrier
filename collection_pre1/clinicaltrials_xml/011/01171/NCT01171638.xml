	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study determine reliability accuracy Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) detect oxygen flow extremity injure non-injured soldier time . This technology may useful detection acute compartment syndrome . We hypothesize : - NIRS value well-correlated intracompartmental pressure measurement - NIRS value significantly different non-injured injured extremity , injured extremity treat fasciotomy acute compartment syndrome . - NIRS value upper extremity foot correlate value normal legs critical control patient patient unilateral sever low extremity injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Near Infrared Spectroscopy Diagnosis Acute Compartment Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose prospective observational cohort study define reliability accuracy Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) detection intra-compartmental tissue perfusion injure noninjured extremity time . Additionally , establish diagnostic perfusion value threshold use subsequent interventional study confirm efficacy NIRS-based ACS monitoring . Through prospective measurement NIRS value , vital sign , intracompartmental pressure clinical examination , guideline parameter establish use NIRS diagnose acute compartment syndrome ( ACS ) , monitor patient risk ACS evaluate adequacy fasciotomy patient treat ACS . Null hypotheses : - NIRS value correlate intracompartmental pressure , obtain course routine care patient combat theater . - There difference NIRS value non-injured , injured extremity injure extremity treat fasciotomy ACS - NIRS value upper extremity foot correlate NIRS value normal legs critical control patient patient unilateral severe low extremity injury . Specific Aims : 1 . Conduct observational , human-use , study compile normative reference database NIRS-measured tissue perfusion uninjured upper extremity injure non-injured leg 120 injured subject , vary ethnicity ( skin pigmentation ) vary degree hemodynamic status ( stable , critically injure ) test 3 hypothesis list . The study group consist one control group ( critically ill without leg injury ) one investigational group ( critically injure leg injury ) : - COHORT 1 : 25 critically injured patient NO severe traumatic low extremity traumatic injury provide normative data `` critically injured '' physiological status ( `` Critical '' CONTROLS ) - COHORT 2 : 95 total ( 35 Cohort 2A ; 35 Cohort 2B ; 25 Cohort 2C ) patient `` severe '' traumatic low extremity injury present `` participate '' level 1 trauma center within 12 hour injury , provide data acute post-injury phase . ( INVESTIGATIONAL COHORT ) - COHORT 2A : Patients meet COHORT 2 inclusion criterion , UNILATERAL `` severe low extremity injury '' . - COHORT 2B : Patients meet COHORT 2 inclusion criterion , BILATERAL `` severe low extremity injury '' . - COHORT 2C ( ACS GROUP ) : Patients meet COHORT 2 inclusion criterion , clinically diagnose treat provider use treat provider 's standard diagnose ACS patient , addition diagnose ACS , undergoes four-compartment leg fasciotomy . Patients cohort need data collection start BEFORE fasciotomy continue AFTER fasciotomy . 2 . Record provider comment regard usability technology new embodiment area need design improvement . Apply knowledge perfect industrial design functionality final device . 3 . Establish evidenced-based clinical guideline diagnosis management ACS traumatically injure soldier test subsequent interventional clinical ( IDE ) study .</detailed_description>
