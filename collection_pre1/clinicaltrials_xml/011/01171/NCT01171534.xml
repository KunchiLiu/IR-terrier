	<brief_summary>Fasciotomy wound rarely able close time index surgery . They often require multiple return surgery closure , occasionally require skin grafting ( i.e . never completely close ) . We interested see whether device , provide constant gradual tension wound , may allow rapid wound closure safe fashion , perhaps even preclude return trip surgery . Null hypothesis # 1 : The Dermaclose Wound Management System ( Woundcare Technologies Inc , Chanhassen , Minnesota ) result closure fasciotomy wound rapidly standard vessel loop technique . Null hypothesis # 2 : The Dermaclose Wound Management System reduce number return trip operate room surgical procedure related closure skin graft fasciotomy wound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Closure Fasciotomy Wounds : A Prospective , Observational Study Continuous External Tissue Expander</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After IRB approval , patient meet inclusion criterion require fasciotomy arm , leg , pelvis consent participation research study . Patients either fasciotomy wound close application Dermaclose device , per manufacturer 's instruction , application vessel loop staple `` shoestring technique '' describe literature ( 1 ) . Choice wound closure technique surgeon discretion . All patient undergo application vacuum-assisted wound closure device ( Wound VAC , Active Healing Solutions Inc , San Antonio , TX ) , standard care temporary coverage open wound ( 2 , 3 ) . Patients return operate room every 2-3 day wound closure skin graft accomplish . If skin closure accomplish operating room , occur prior return trip operating room , definitive suture closure wound perform local anaesthetic , follow removal Dermaclose device vessel loop staple shoestring . Decisions regard wound closure skin graft operating room leave judgment attend surgeon .</detailed_description>
