	<detailed_description>Introduction High leave ventricular filling pressure ( LVFP ) associate volume overload patient heart failure also correlate extent severe symptom low survival rate . In study 1000 patient hospitalize acute decompensated heart failure , persistently elevate LVFP 18 mmHg increase 1-year mortality compare LVFP le 16 mmHg . Investigators also demonstrate acute reduction LVFP vasodilator therapy improve cardiac function reduce mortality risk , suggest LVFP appropriate marker cardiac risk functional improvement . However , LVFP measurement involve invasive catheterization , limit clinical use especially outpatient set . In advance new technique modality , echocardiography provide useful parameter assess LVFP , myocardial tissue Doppler imaging . Many article document peak velocity early-diastolic trans-mitral inflow velocity divide early-diastolic velocity mitral annulus close correlate LVFP . However , myocardial tissue Doppler provide information regional myocardium , patient regional wall motion abnormality , coronary artery disease , ca n't assess method without handicap . In addition , conduction disturbance , like bundle branch block , also influence result myocardial tissue Doppler . For resolve problem , design new global parameter ass LVFP . In prior study , disclose logarithmic relationship LVFP leave atrial distensibility acute myocardial infarction patient receive primary coronary intervention . This time , extend conclusion general population receive echocardiographic examination attempt . Additionally , infer leave atrial distensibility indicate LVFP would influence long-term prognosis , include event rate cardiovascular event , stroke death . Purpose Left atrial size , particularly leave atrial volume , recognize marker leave ventricular diastolic dysfunction . Contrary flow tissue Doppler parameter , leave atrial volume independent acute volume load therefore may provide accurate assessment acute chronic leave ventricular dysfunction . In addition , measurement leave atrial volume lack handicap tissue Doppler , include regional myocardial dysfunction coronary artery disease bundle branch block . In recent study , end-systolic leave atrial volume ( maximal leave atrial volume ) useful predict risk atrial fibrillation cardiac surgery . The short-term long-term prognosis acute myocardial infarction also associate leave atrial volume . In patient mitral regurgitation , could use reliably estimate regurgitant volume . Despite end-systolic left atrial volume provide prognostic significance many disease entity , leave atrium fill empty dynamic cyclic motion , speculate leave atrial distensibility , defined percentage change leave atrial volume end-systolic end-diastolic phase , prognostic power represent LVFP predict prognosis . Based phenomenon high LVFP , conduct stretch leave atrium diastolic phase , induces leave atrial distension make reduction distensibility end-systolic end-diastolic phase , prove logarithmic relationship leave atrial distensibility LVFP . Materials Methods Subjects : 2000 consecutive patient receive echocardiographic examination enrol . The exclusion criterion include ( 1 ) patient prosthetic mitral valve mitral stenosis , ( 2 ) rhythm sinus rhythm , ( 3 ) age 18 years-old , ( 4 ) inadequate image quality , ( 5 ) lack informed consent . Traditional echocardiographic measurement myocardial tissue Doppler : All study perform experienced sonographers review staff cardiologist advance training echocardiography . Left ventricular function assess Simpson 's method . Mitral regurgitation grade color flow imaging . Mitral inflow assess pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography form apical 4-chamber view . The Doppler bean align parallel direction flow , 1- 2-mm sample volume place tip mitral leaflet diastole . From mitral inflow profile , E- A-wave velocity , E-deceleration time , E/A velocity ration measure . Pulmonary venous flow record pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume place 1 cm right upper pulmonary vein . The flow velocity record , ratio systolic diastolic forward flow ( S/D ratio ) calculate . Doppler tissue image mitral annulus septal , lateral inferior border also obtain apical view . Diastolic fill categorize normal ( grade 0 ) , impaired relaxation ( grade 1 ) , pseudonormalization ( grade 2 ) , restrictive ( grade 3 ) combination transmitral pulmonary flow pattern validate previously . Left atrial volume measurement : Left atrial volume assess biplane area-length method apical 4- 2-chamber view . The volume measure end-systolic ( mitral valve open large dimension ) , pre-atrial contraction ( P wave ) , end-diastolic ( small dimension onset QRS complex ) , use high frame rate . The left atrial outline three phase retrace off-line three consecutive beat , average . The recess pulmonary vein leave atrial appendage exclude . The length leave atrium perpendicular line measure middle plane mitral annulus superior aspect leave atrium . The left atrial volume calculate : 0.85 x 4-chamber area x 2-chamber area ÷ short two length . The volume index body surface area . Left atrial distensibility define : ( end-systole leave atrial volume - end-diastole left atrial volume ) ÷ end-systole left atrial volume . Left atrial ejection fraction calculate : ( pre-atrial contraction volume - end-diastole left atrial volume ) ÷ pre-atrial contraction volume . Follow-up : Clinical outcome determine 1-year indexed examination . Follow-up include assessment occurrence sudden death , heart failure hospitalization , atrial fibrillation , stroke , death ( cardiac non-cardiac ) per 3 month telephone interview . Interobserver variability : In case , atrial volume measure two observer independently . Interobserver variability calculate difference value obtain tow observer divide mean . Statistical analysis : SPSS software use statistical analysis . All continuous variable present mean ± standard deviation . Comparison clinical echocardiographic characteristic perform chi-square analysis categorical variable Student test echocardiography continuous variable . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Patients subdivide four quartile accord leave atrial distensibility . Unadjusted survival curve produce use Kaplan-Meier method . The log-rank test use compare survival curve . Adjusted survival curve construct use variable enter Cox model set mean value total population . The hazard ratio low leave atrial distensibility assess compare quartile quartile .</detailed_description>
