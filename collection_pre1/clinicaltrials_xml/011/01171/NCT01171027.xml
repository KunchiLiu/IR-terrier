	<brief_summary>This study design United States multicenter prospective randomize control non-inferiority evaluation transgastric transvaginal Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) cholecystectomy compare laparoscopic cholecystectomy elective surgery patient . Up 200 patient enrol obtain 70 NOTES cholecystectomy ( 35 transgastric 35 transvaginal ) 70 laparoscopic cholecystectomy randomize basis . In order evaluate hypothesis NOTES cholecystectomy equivalent safety efficacy laparoscopic cholecystectomy , clinical administrative outcome measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary To assess safety efficacy transgastric transvaginal cholecystectomy compare conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . To assess pain associate transgastric transvaginal cholecystectomy compare conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Secondary To assess cosmesis associate transgastric transvaginal cholecystectomy compare conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . To assess objective operative cost logistical comparison transgastric transvaginal cholecystectomy compare conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . To identify unforeseen barrier transgastric transvaginal surgery adoption .</detailed_description>
