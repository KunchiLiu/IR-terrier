	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate Ofatumumab combination CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , hydroxydaunorubicin ( doxorubicin ) , Oncovin ( vincristine ) , prednisone/prednisolone , standard chemotherapy treatment ) induction maintenance treatment Richter 's Syndrome . This study aim evaluate overall response rate CHOP-O ( CHOP combination Ofatumumab ) accord Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma . The hypothesis would treatment CHOP-O Richter 's Syndrome ( RS ) , show difference overall survival ( people live long ) , compare standard treatment CHOP-R ( CHOP chemotherapy plus Rituximab ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cyclophosphamide , Hydroxydaunorubicin , Oncovin , Prednisone ( CHOP ) With Ofatumumab Patients With Richter 's Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Richter 's Syndrome ( RS ) high-grade transformation occur 5-15 % patient B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( B-CLL ) . RS complication B-CLL leukemia change fast-growing diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . The pathogenesis ( mechanism disease cause ) RS poorly understand predictor transformation response treatment unknown . Management RS remain unsatisfactory ; mean overall survival patient treat conventional chemo-immunotherapy CHOP-R 8 month end treatment . CHOP acronym chemotherapy regimen , cyclophosphamide , hydroxydaunorubicin ( doxorubicin ) , Oncovin ( vincristine ) , prednisone/prednisolone ) R stand monoclonal antibody , Rituximab . Ofatumumab , next generation monoclonal anti CD20 antibody , proven single agent activity relapsed/refractory B-CLL non-Hodgkin lymphoma . In addition , show favourable safety profile maintenance set . Therefore , propose evaluate Ofatumumab combination CHOP induction maintenance treatment patient RS . The primary objective study evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) CHOP-O ( CHOP chemotherapy plus Ofatumumab ) accord Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma ( Cheson ) . Secondary objective feasibility recruitment , progression free survival overall survival , clinical benefit change patient report outcome measure , safety tolerability . This multi-centre non-randomised Phase II National Cancer Research Institute ( NCRI ) feasibility study 35 patient newly diagnose Richter 's Syndrome UK . CHOP-O give six cycle follow six cycle Ofatumumab maintenance treatment every eight week three month follow-up period . The total duration recruitment 24 month start open first site .</detailed_description>
