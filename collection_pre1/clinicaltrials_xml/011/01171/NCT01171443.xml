	<brief_title>The Pathophysiology Bortezomib Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib show impressive clinical activity alone combination novel agent treatment multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Peripheral neuropathy significant dose limit toxicity bortezomib , typically occur within first treatment cycle bortezomib , reach plateau around cycle 5 , appear increase thereafter . Although bortezomib know selective proteasome inhibitor , mechanisms cytotoxicity poorly understood . It theoretically hypothesize bortezomib abrogates degradation I-kB , block transcriptional activity NF-kB , however , recent study demonstrate bortezomib elicits activation multiple pathway cancer cell , reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) pathway . The involvement oxidative stress support emerge study show ROS generation play critical role initiation bortezomib induce apoptotic cascade . Oxidative stress complex dynamic situation characterize imbalance production ROS availability action antioxidant .</detailed_description>
