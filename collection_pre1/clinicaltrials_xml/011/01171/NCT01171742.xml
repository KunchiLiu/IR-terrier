	<brief_title>Effect Intermittent Hepatic Inflow Occlusion During Donor Hepatectomy In Living Donor Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion ( IHIO ) clamp portal triad , also call Pringle maneuver , safe effective procedure major hepatectomy patient liver disease . IHIO minimize blood loss operation time liver resection . In addition , ischemic preconditioning IHIO report protective effect patient undergo liver resection . In set live donor liver transplantation ( LDLT ) , one important concern liver donor safety . Several study show safety IHIO donor liver transplantation ( LT ) . However , effect precondition IHIO donor hepatectomy LDLT recipient remain unclear . Several small series assess effect recipient ischemic preconditioning whole liver transplantation decease donor . The role IHIO , however , fully elucidate liver donor recipient LDLT . In randomized , prospective study , 'll evaluate efficacy IHIO recipients donor .</detailed_description>
