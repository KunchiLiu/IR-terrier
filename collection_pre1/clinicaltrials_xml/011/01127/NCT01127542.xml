	<brief_summary>The majority patient CLL diagnose early stage disease ( Binet stage A Rai stage 0/I ) . Standard management patient observation , median age diagnosis 72 median time progression &gt; 5-10 year , many never require treatment . In contrast , proportion patient aggressive disease , last decade , number molecular factor identify may use identify patient poor prognosis disease . Each associate shortened time treatment ( typically less 3 year patient 2 factor ) , reduce survival , case p53/ATM inactivation , resistance treatment . Whether possible improve outcome patient CLL adverse prognostic factor early intervention treatment unknown . Several trial 1980 's demonstrate treatment stage A CLL conventional chemotherapy ( chlorambucil ) alter natural history disease , although none study stratify patient accord risk . The choice alternative potential therapeutic agent limit ; effective patient adverse prognostic factor , acceptable toxicity , able overcome drug resistance associate p53/ATM inactivation ideally orally administer . Two recent phase II trial demonstrate Lenalidomide effective treatment relapsed/refractory disease . Importantly , study include high proportion patient adverse prognostic factor include p53 inactivation . The principle objective study investigate efficacy Lenalidomide achieve disease response ( complete remission clearance minimal residual disease ) patient poor risk early stage disease , together assessment safety tolerability .</brief_summary>
