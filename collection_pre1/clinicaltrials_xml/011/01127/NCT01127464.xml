	<brief_summary>DCVax-001 recombinant protein vaccine design prevent potentially treat human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . The vaccine compose fusion protein contain human monoclonal antibody specific dendritic cell receptor , DEC-205 ( CD205 ) , HIV gag p24 protein . The vaccine design target HIV antigens directly endocytic pathway dendritic cell ( DCs ) allow efficient process presentation multiple HIV peptides MHC class I II product , induce HIV-specific CD8+ CD4+ T cell . This vaccine candidate must combine appropriate immunostimulants ( adjuvant ) induce immunity antigen . In proposed clinical trial use poly ICLC ( Hiltonol ) Oncovir , Inc adjuvant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This trial investigate whether delivery HIV antigens via immunization anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody plus poly ICLC , adjuvant , safe induces either cellular humoral immunogenicity healthy volunteer . We propose assess quality immunity elicit DEC target vaccine human . Immunogenicity HIV antigen delivery directly dendritic cell could provide proof-of-concept dendritic cell target protein vaccine may serve stand-alone vaccine strategy combination vaccine modality HIV disease . The main hypothesis study assess delivery HIV antigens via immunization anti-DEC-205 p24 monoclonal antibody ( DCVax-001 ) plus poly ICLC ( Hiltonol ) safe induces either cellular humoral immunogenicity HIV-uninfected , healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
