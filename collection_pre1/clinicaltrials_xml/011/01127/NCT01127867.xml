	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Docosahexaenoic Acid ( DHA ) Obese Menopausal Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer one frequently see cancer United States . Breast cancer occur age particularly common post menopausal woman . Obesity increase risk breast cancer primarily type stimulate female sex hormone estrogen . In obesity , fat cell produce estrogen alter breast tissue , lower blood estrogen reduces incidence breast cancer . Inflammation fat tissue , coronary blood vessel liver also see obesity . Animal experiment show inflammation fat tissue increase production estrogen , thus reduce inflammation fat tissue might lower estrogen level risk breast cancer obese woman . A diet high omega-3-fatty acid , find fish oil , show mouse reduce inflammation aromatase expression ( rate limit enzyme estrogen synthesis ) fat tissue . This pilot study five obese , post-menopausal woman additional 12 morbidly obese post-menopausal woman include nutritional medical evaluation , four day inpatient hospital stay regular diet , measure inflammation estrogen produce machinery volunteer subject . Following baseline measurement , subject provide DHA supplement take daily three month request weigh twice weekly home goal maintain weight . Telephone interview perform scheduled point check-in subject six week return visit OPRC conduct assess progress provide additional supplement . At three month subject readmitted hospital repeat test perform start DHA supplement . If study show feasibility positive result extend subject intervention future .</detailed_description>
