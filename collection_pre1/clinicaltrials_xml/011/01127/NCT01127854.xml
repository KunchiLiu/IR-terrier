	<brief_summary>Recent investigation group identify genetic variant gene associate monogenic form nephrolithiasis express idiopathic calcium oxalate kidney stone patient could influence stone form risk . Utilizing patient sample Mayo Clinic Florida Kidney Stone Registry , demonstrate expression heterozygous mutation idiopathic nephrolithiasis act genetic modifier disease presentation increase risk kidney stone formation . Complimented analysis environmental lifestyle risk factor , study define environmental genetic susceptibility factor involve kidney stone formation reoccurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Contribution Gene Variants Idiopathic Urolithiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nephrolithiasis occur approximately 1 10 individual United States increase prevalence note past three decade ( ref : Worcester E , Coe F. Nephrolithiasis . Prim Care Clin Office Pract 35 ( 2008 ) 369-391 ) . Recurrence common - occur 50 % patient , many require surgical intervention . An estimated 5-6 billion dollar year spend treatment kidney stone . Symptoms kidney stone include flank pain , blood urine , nausea vomiting . Beyond acute attack associate considerable morbidity cost , recent report identify association kidney stone formation increase risk development hypertension , chronic kidney disease , end stage renal disease myocardial infarction . Therefore , nephrolithiasis impact socioeconomics also broader public health implication . Genetic environmental risk factor link nephrolithiasis 40 % patient present kidney stone least one relative also stone former . Genetic variant causative monogenic form nephrolithiasis well define . However frequency monogenic mutation presence predispose factor disease poorly understood within idiopathic stone form population . We recently identify heterozygous mutation HOGA1 , gene associate onset primary hyperoxularia Type III , also present within idiopathic stone form population absent match control . These finding suggest presence mutation could indicative increase risk kidney stone formation within patient . We therefore propose ; Aim 1 : Validate expand previous study define genetic variation HOGA1 predispose factor idiopathic calcium-oxalate stone formation , Aim 2 : Mutational analysis gene involve kidney stone formation determination genetics risk . These clinical study identify frequency know genetic variant associate monogenic form nephrolithiasis within idiopathic stone form population associate presence heighten risk . Patient genomic DNA , blood , clinical data risk data available Mayo Clinic Florida Kidney Stone Registry . Genomic DNA RNA assess mutation within HOGA1 significance predispose factor disease evaluate statistical analysis compare environmental factor risk . Evaluations also undertake control patient sample , identify mutation specific idiopathic kidney stone formation risk . Furthermore , genetic variant within AGXT , GRHPR , HOGA1 , CLCN5 , OCRL1 , SLC3A1 , SLC7A9 , APRT analyze frequency idiopathic nephrolithiasis patient control patient population determine role predictive genetic marker idiopathic disease risk . This propose study potential identify genetic variant predispose factor idiopathic kidney stone formation predictive disease risk . These study relevance personalize treatment regimens disease intervention target prevention reoccurrence . Furthermore , knowledge gain pertain genetic variant idiopathic stone former may lead creation genetic test early diagnosis patient high risk idiopathic nephrolithiasis . Nine hundred idiopathic kidney stone former 900 non-kidney stone forming control examine evaluation HOGA1 genetic variant . We propose use patient resource provide Kidney Stone Registry control sample Mayo Clinic BioBank Florida . Briefly , Kidney Stone Registry , case present kidney stone invite enroll Registry . Enrolled patient approach data abstraction , risk factor questionnaire completion , biospecimen collection ( blood DNA ) long-term follow-up . At time 1500 phenotypically well characterized patient enrol within registry approximately 500 new patient enrollment year . For study , utilize sample patient history idiopathic calcium oxalate stone former control . The PI application oversee run registry . Controls select patient consented genomic DNA sample Mayo Clinic Biobank ( http : //mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/biobank/ ) . These control define patient negative personal history symptomatic urolithiasis family history kidney stone formation . Dr. Parker oversee run Mayo Clinic BioBank Florida . Patient record information available PI , co-investigator biostatistician name proposal . Phenotypical Analysis : Phenotype data extract patient 's medical record . All patient provide informed consent DNA testing record review research protocols approve Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board . Risk Factor Data Collection : A self-administered questionnaire provide patient initial visit practitioner , provide within Appendix . Those patient consent enrolled Kidney Stone Registry consent include study case study group . The questionnaire request patient provide information pertain family history , lifestyle environmental risk factor kidney stone formation . All questionnaire review study coordinator completeness accuracy response .</detailed_description>
