	<brief_summary>Cancer cachexia syndrome ( CCS ) frequent , cause high morbidity mortality affect one . The mechanism catabolism cause tumour . CRP surrogate marker catabolism . There effective treatment option CCS . Lenalidomide , derivate thalidomide , immunomodulatory drug ( IMiD® ) . One ' main effect decrease inflammatory cytokine . As CCS treatment , thalidomide show randomize control trial stabilize lean body mass . The effect lenalidomide solid tumour patient negligible although , might decrease tumour progression . However , even lenalidomide may uninteresting anticancer treatment might affect CCS dynamic . Respective data currently lack . Therefore , dose level anticancer effect could expect chosen ( group A ) . Relevant anti-inflammatory effect may occur commonly used dos achieve tumour control , expect main anti-cachexia effect . Therefore , second CRP-response guide treatment arm ( group B ) chosen . Hypothesis : To test whether response rate new standard basic cachexia management estimate 5 % lenalidomide ( either fix dose CRP-guided dose ) addition basic cachexia management least 25 % . The primary objective study assess efficacy lenalidomide lean body mass handgrip strength advance solid tumour patient inflammatory CCS .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Age : Patients must older 18 year age . 2 . Tumour situation : Patients type advanced ( define locally recurrent metastatic ) , incurable solid tumour . 3 . Cachexia : Presence CCS , define involuntary loss weight ≥2 % 2 month ≥5 % 6 month , ongoing last 4 week , lack fluid retention . 4 . Inflammation : CRP must ≥ 30mg/l absence likely cause increase CRP like infection autoimmune disorder . 5 . No simple starvation : Patients must able eat , define severe structural barrier upper gastrointestinal tract bowel obstruction . 6 . Life expectancy , physical performance : Patient must expect life expectancy &gt; 3 month accord palliative performance ( Pap ) score WHO performance status ( PS ) ≤ 2 . 7 . No anticachexia appetitestimulating medication : Patients allow corticosteroid unless maximum 2 day per week chemotherapy , progestin therapy , Cyclooxigenase2 inhibitor ( COX2 inhibitor ) , anabolic drug 28 day start trial medication study conclusion . Prokinetic medication , NSAR , paracetamol novamin sulphate allow , give fix dose two week visit 1 , expect give whole trial period . 8 . Laboratory test result : Granulocyte count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L , serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ( 177 μmol/L ) , creatinine clearance ClCr ≥ 50ml/min , total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL ( 25μmol/L ) , AST ( SGOT ) / ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2 x ULN hepatic metastasis present ≤ 5 x ULN . 9 . No trial : Patient participate clinical intervention 28 day start trial medication study conclusion . 10 . Women childbearing potential ( see Annex 1 ) : A negative pregnancy test &amp; effective contraception mandatory childbearing age . A female childbearing potential ( FCBP ) sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . A FCBP potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mU/mL within 10 14 day prior within 24 hour prescribe lenalidomide ( prescription must fill within 7 day ) must either commit continued abstinence heterosexual intercourse begin TWO acceptable method birth control , one highly effective method one additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME , least 28 day start take lenalidomide . FCBP must also agree ongoing pregnancy test . Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . See ( Annex 2 ) : Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods . 11 . Cognition : Presence normal level consciousness ( mandatory normal abbreviate screening minimental test common minimental ≥ 27/30 ; elderly patient age ≥ 65 year patient low education mini mental status ≥25/30 point consider adequate ) . 12 . Logistics : The patient able comply study schedule procedure ( include fast blood draw certain visit ) 13 . Consent : The patient voluntarily sign date informed consent ( IC ) , approve Ethics Committee ( EC ) , prior studyspecific procedure . Will consent use asprin ( 100mg ) low molecular weight heparin ( intolerant aspirin ) prophylactic dose ( e.g . Fragmin 2500U sc od ) . Study participant agrees register mandatory RevAssist® program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist® . ( Appendix 18 ) 1 . Untreated secondary cause cachexia ( oral thrush , nausea , vomit , constipation , diarrhoea , pain VAS &gt; 3 , depression , dyspnoea ) 2 . CTCAEv3.0 ≥ grade 2 due anticancer treatment ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy surgery ) 3 . Any psychiatric disorder , alcohol illicit drug abuse language problem would prevent patient fill questionnaire adequately attend study visit accord protocol . 4 . Parenteral nutrition 5 .
