	<brief_summary>Obesity establish adolescence strongly predict obesity remainder adult life , consequence potentially devastate , characterize lifelong burden co-morbid condition depression . This study provide exposure physical activity design teach empower sedentary college age individual become physically active . The investigator evaluate whether exposure result lasting change exercise behavior body composition . The study also provide good understanding genetic factor influence persistence exercise program influence whole body response exercise training . Altering course obesity adolescence potential reduce adult prevalence obesity consequently attenuate public health burden overweight obesity investigator population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Training Interventions Genetics Exercise Response ( TIGER )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among great public health concern today rapid rise obesity pediatric population , exceed 18 % child ( 6-11 ) 17 % adolescent ( 12-19 ) , obesity among young adult ( 20-39 ) approach 30 % . Though much learn regard regulation body weight development adiposity , prevalence obesity continue rise , demonstrate even today factor predict healthy weight maintenance remain poorly understood . In fact , transition overweight adolescent obese adult almost inevitable , probability obesity adulthood exceed 50 % among child &gt; 13 year age whose BMI percentiles meet exceed 95th percentile age gender . But could deter expect transition overweight adolescent obese adult intervene young person critical time he/she begin feel empower independence ? This essence Training Interventions Genetics Exercise Response ( TIGER ) Study . The TIGER Study begin 2003 goal identify genetic factor influence physiologic response exercise training , introduce sedentary college age individual regular exercise . Subjects TIGER Study currently undergo 30 week ( 2 semester ) exercise training , 3 day per week 40 minute 65-85 % age-predicted maximum heart rate . More 80 % subject lose weight maintain weight within 2 kg , 18 % subject gain 2 kg . We identify preliminary association gene variation exercise dropout first phase study , phase 2 TIGER study , build observation . We focus three primary area investigation : 1 ) formal evaluation TIGER Study intervention protocol achieve long-term change participant ; 2 ) investigation gene expression pattern skeletal muscle subcutaneous adipose tissue strategy identify gene relate exercise response ; 3 ) investigation association genetic variation exercise adherence . Subjects undergo 35 week exercise training base establish TIGER protocol , subject re-contacted 6 , 12 , 24 month follow completion study protocol question regard current exercise habit body weight . In addition , genetic analysis candidate gene relate exercise behavior neural signal undertaken order identify genetic factor may influence exercise adherence . Finally , pattern gene expression subcutaneous adipose , skeletal muscle , peripheral leukocyte analyze baseline follow exercise train order identify factor influence physiologic change consequent exercise training . Results study design enlighten current understanding individual respond and/or persist exercise , ultimate goal formulate well efficacious intervention obesity .</detailed_description>
