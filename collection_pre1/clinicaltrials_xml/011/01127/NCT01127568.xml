	<brief_summary>Objective : To use propranolol treat establish chronic post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) reduce reconsolidation reactivate trauma memory . Hypothesis : A series treatment propranolol , comparison placebo , produce significant reduction PTSD symptom severity participant chronic PTSD . Study Design : This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize study . Methodology : Twenty-five participant per group chronic PTSD recruit . On first visit psychodiagnostic psychometric evaluation take place . In addition , script-preparation script-driven imagery procedure occur . Following , participant return week period 6 week participate reactivation session propranolol placebo ( participant assign propranolol condition receive propranolol throughout , participant assign placebo condition receive placebo throughout ) . Two week later , participant return follow-up psychodiagnostic psychometric evaluation , well psychophysiological assessment use script-driven imagery procedure . Data Analysis : A two-factor analysis variance ( ANOVA ) repeat measure perform study completers . The Drug factor two level : propranolol placebo . The Time factor two level : pre-treatment post-treatment . We predict significant Drug x Time interaction , precisely great decrease PTSD severity propranolol placebo group . The psychophysiological data contrast normative cutoff score PTSD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Novel Treatment For Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Using Post-Reactivation Propranolol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historical background . Recent animal research indicate retrieval return consolidated memory , aspect ( ) , labile state must restabilized order persist . This process call reconsolidation , although identical consolidation . Support reconsolidation come experiment variety specie range snail human ; appetitive , aversive neutral task ; use broad range approach , include systemic localize drug administration , gene manipulation , interference new learn . Memory impairment due block reconsolidation long-lasting . Reconsolidation impairment distinct extinction make occur even reinforce trial use reactivate memory , show renewal contextual shift , double-dissociated extinction , distinct neurochemical signature extinction . To date single , publish , control study support reconsolidation , blockade , human . That study involve weaken consolidated memory simple motor sequence present conflict sequence reactivation memory original sequence . According translational model pathogenesis post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , psychologically traumatic event overstimulates endogenous stress hormone , turn overly strengthen consolidation memory event , lead excessively powerful persistent memory easily activate , consequent anxiety dysfunction . Animal human data indicate memory-modulating effect stress hormone mediate noradrenergic activity amygdala oppose β-adrenergic blocker propranolol . Administration propranolol immediate aftermath psychologically traumatic event reduces strength memory , manifest low physiological respond script-driven mental imagery event measure 3 month later , low self-reported PTSD symptom measure 2 month later . According model , exist window opportunity influence consolidation traumatic event long-term memory . Once window close , memory trace longer labile , β-blockers would longer able exert anti-PTSD effect . Attempting prevent PTSD block consolidation traumatic memory ( aspect ) subject formidable limitation case unlikely receive clinical attention long window opportunity shut . In person develop PTSD , would happen week , month , year earlier . However , traumatic memory undergoes reconsolidation reactivate , could re-open window opportunity influence memory pharmacologically . The post-reactivation administration propranolol could reduce strength traumatic memory block reconsolidation manner parallel reduce strength immediately follow occurrence block consolidation . In support possibility , consolidated memory aversive task animal show become sensitive β-blockade reactivation . Specifically , administration propranolol follow reactivation find reduce inhibitory avoidance auditory fear conditioning ; latter impairment stable one month . These result demonstrate rodent aversively condition memory reactivate become sensitive effect propranolol . Previous study support propose research . In preliminary study , employ validated psychophysiological script-driven imagery technique study 19 participant chronic PTSD result various psychologically traumatic event . Physiological response traumatic imagery show reliably discriminate PTSD non-PTSD psychological trauma victim , lead inclusion PTSD criterion `` physiological reactivity exposure internal cue symbolize resemble aspect traumatic event '' current Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , fourth edition ( DSM-IV ) . Each participant describe traumatic event cause PTSD ; serve reactivate traumatic memory . Immediately thereafter , participant receive either oral 40 mg short-acting propranolol follow 2 hour later oral 60 mg long-acting propranolol ( n = 9 ) , look-alike placebo capsule ( n = 10 ) , randomize double-blind . Group demographic psychometric mean two group highly similar . A trained research assistant compose script portray event participant 's word record playback laboratory . One week later , participant listen audio record personal traumatic event psychophysiology laboratory imagine event happening , heart rate ( HR ) , skin conductance ( SC ) , leave corrugator ( facial frowning muscle ) electromyogram ( EMG ) responses measure . Overall physiological respond mental imagery traumatic event significantly small PTSD participant receive propranolol week earlier compare receive placebo ( multivariate p = .007 ) . Drug condition account impressive 49 % variance overall physiological responding . The univariate analysis indicate HR SC , EMG , responses significantly small propranolol compare placebo participant . The mean HR SC responses placebo participant normative cut-offs PTSD ( dash line ) , whereas mean HR SC responses propranolol participant normative PTSD cut-offs . The mean EMG responses group fell normative PTSD cut-off . The observed effect size ( term Cohen 's , i.e. , difference group mean divide pooled standard deviation ) predict direction . By conventional standard , effect size large SC , large HR , small EMG . The psychophysiological result present study along previously report study propranolol administer immediate aftermath traumatic event indicate post-reactivation propranolol recapitulate effect consolidation . Self-reported PTSD symptom measure Impact Event Scale-Revised show significant decline propranolol participant ( 19 % ) , placebo participant ( 11 % ) . However , Group x Time interaction statistically significant , effect size moderate . Certainly decline self-reported PTSD symptom propranolol group less `` decline '' physiological response traumatic imagery ( take placebo group 's response comparison absence baseline physiological measurement ) . However , subjective nature , symptom self-reports vulnerable number potentially confounding factor , include demand effect , long-standing belief expectation oneself one 's situation , incorporate one 's symptoms one 's identity , secondary gain . All factor may make change self-reports difficult change physiological response , directly access change strength traumatic memory . It may anything great moderate improvement PTSD symptom much ask single session single dose propranolol . Rationale behind propose research . The preliminary result describe suggest use pharmacological consolidation blocker conjunction memory reactivation could important implication therapy . Currently cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) rely heavily exposure extinction , psychotherapeutic treatment choice anxiety disorder , include PTSD . However , beneficial effect PTSD -like drug treatment- partial , one-third patient show lasting , clinically meaningful improvement . Modulating reconsolidation may certain advantage approach . Reconsolidation blockade target traumatic memory directly , whereas extinction attempt inhibit traumatic memory new ( inhibitory ) learning . There two important drawback extinction therapy . First , extinction inhibits underlie fear memory , tend spontaneously recover passage time . Second , extinction context-dependent . Thus , cognitive behavioral therapist must find way make extinction-based therapy context-independent long-lasting . Otherwise , beneficial effect acquire office lose home time . In contrast , reconsolidation theoretical advantage impairment induce blockade context-independent long-lasting . From practical standpoint , CBT typically require period lengthy exposure traumatic memory fear situation promote extinction . In case reconsolidation blockade , animal research suggest briefer exposure suitable . A report case series 15 patient suffer various mental disorder treat electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) claim ECT administer reactivation memory , obsession , hallucination , substantially effective . This roughly consistent possibility psychiatric symptom make undergo reconsolidation blockade . However , patient long history psychopathology ECT treatment , , along absence quantitative outcome measure appropriate control , preclude firm conclusion . Moreover , treatment involve administration ECT awake patient . The practical advantage pharmacological reconsolidation blockade gross approach obvious .</detailed_description>
