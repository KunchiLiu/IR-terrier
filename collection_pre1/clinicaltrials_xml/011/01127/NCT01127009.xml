	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , mitoxantrone , etoposide , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose bortezomib give together mitoxantrone , etoposide , cytarabine treat patient relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine DLT , MTD , recommend Phase 2 dose bortezomib combination MEC patient relapsed/refractory AML . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe non-dose limit toxicity associate bortezomib combination MEC patient relapsed/refractory AML . II . To describe preliminary evidence clinical activity combination ( CR rate ) relapsed/refractory AML . III . To determine median CD74 antigen expression patient achieve response versus patient achieve response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bortezomib . Patients receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 4 , 8 11 ; mitoxantrone IV , etoposide IV 1 hour , intermediate-dose cytarabine IV 6 hour day 1-6 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-5 week .</detailed_description>
