	<brief_summary>Land military mission generally combine prolong walking/moderate-pace-running physical action creep , jumping , shoot , â€¦ associate direct carry high severe load equipment supply ( 20-30 50 kg ) soldier . For infantry section , `` typical '' intervention phase last 20-24 h combine variable intensity grade . Consequently , military mission characteristic interesting investigation field human fatigue . Previous study investigate human neuromuscular alteration prolong `` normal '' locomotion exercise [ Millet et al. , 2004 , 2009 ] , thus aim study characterize neuromuscular determinant fatigue induced 24-h Simulated Military Effort ( SME ) 4-h Military Road March ( MM ) , perform high load carriage . Additionally , consequence fatigue physiological biomechanical parameter locomotion investigate .</brief_summary>
