Antimuscarinics know inhibit contraction detrusor muscle ( smooth muscle cell ) block muscarinic receptor ( M2/M3 ) important efferent nerve conduction . This conventional therapy OAB important adverse effect , notably gastrointestinal tract constipation , excretory gland sense xerostomia/xerophthalmia , nerve cell brain inhibit cognitive function heart muscle cell accelerate heart rate . Especially elderly people affect undesirable effect . Because change receptor profile , effect antimuscarinics improvement symptom might lower elderly people another substance less side effect would great interest . No adverse effect report B. pinnatum . Until , data use OAB . Efficacy tolerability B. pinnatum treatment OAB major outcome measure clinical trial . - 20 woman include phase 2 drug study , treat Bryophyllum pinnatum form commercially available Bryophyllum tablet capsule ( verum : 3x2capsules/day ) lactose capsule ( placebo : 3x2 capsules/day ) , 10 woman group .
