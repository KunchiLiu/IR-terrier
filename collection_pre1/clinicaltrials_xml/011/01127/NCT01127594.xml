	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety/Tolerability Intra-Arterial Temozolomide Patients w/Extremity Melanoma Isolated Limb Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . The primary objective study determine safety profile intra-arterial temozolomide administration Isolated Limb Infusion ( ILI ) define dose limit toxicity associate treatment determine maximum tolerate dose intra-arterial administration temozolomide ILI use phase II efficacy trial . 2 . Population include patient undergone previous Melphalan base regional therapy respond optimally present persistent , progressive , recurrent disease . Study activity include tumor tissue sampling , blood sampling , subject undergo Isolated Limb Infusion . 3 . To define response in-field ( area limb tourniquet ) out-of-field ( area outside tourniquet ) patient treat temozolomide base ILI . Response trial define RECIST criterion ( CR , PR , SD , PD 12 week post ILI ) . A CR rate 20 % would consider preliminary evidence promise approach group patient previous melphalan regional treatment . ILI melphalan complete response rate approximately 35 % na√Øve patient 20 % patient previously receive melphalan base regional therapy . To assess propose treatment effect quality life measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Melanoma .</detailed_description>
