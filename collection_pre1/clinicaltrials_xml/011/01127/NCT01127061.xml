	<brief_summary>The investigator propose pilot randomize control trial determine safety potential benefit moderate intensity exercise patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . The investigator hypotheses exercise parameter derive baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test target appropriately safe level exercise intensity cause significant arrhythmias exacerbate symptom exercise train 4 month result significant improvement peak oxygen consumption quality life , neutral effect clinical characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal randomize clinical pilot trial establish safety profile potential benefit moderate intensity exercise patient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) . Participation competitive athletics associate increased risk sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) individual structural heart disease , include HCM . This appropriately lead establishment national guideline base expert opinion discourage participation high intensity competitive sport , burst exertion ( e.g. , sprint ) , isometric exercise ( e.g. , heavy lifting ) . Non-competitive , low moderate intensity exercise allowable , although many physician HCM patient still understandably apprehensive . Data safety recreational exercise program , gauge appropriate intensity level , desperately need HCM patient reap well establish health benefit regular physical activity . Limited , compel animal data suggest moderate intensity exercise safe , may also prevent even reverse cardiac hypertrophy , fibrosis , myocellular disarray , apoptosis associate HCM . There publish study exercise patient HCM , although large clinical trial heart failure show exercise training safe , improve functional capacity quality life , low cardiovascular mortality . The pilot randomize control trial propose first determine safety moderate intensity exercise training explore potential benefit patient HCM .</detailed_description>
