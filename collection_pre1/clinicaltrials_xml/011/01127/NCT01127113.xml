	<brief_summary>Myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) usually consequence rupture fatty 'plaque ' heart artery . The presence fat debris cause propagation blood clot blockage artery . The heart muscle normally supply artery becomes deprive oxygen , starve long enough , area muscle dy . Much heart muscle damage cause overactivation inflammatory cell . Whilst inflammation beneficial healing process , accumulate evidence overactivation inflammatory process contributes muscle damage cell death myocardial infarction . We recently develop mean label human blood cell 'nanoparticles ' iron oxide safely reinjected blood allow cell track see body use conventional magnetic resonance scanner . In propose study aim recruit patient recent heart attack perform similar cell label reinjection label cell volunteer 's blood stream via arm track fate blood cell course day month . We think labelled inflammatory cell 'home ' site heart attack visible use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) heart . We aim highlight role inflammatory cell myocardial infarction , also propose , successful , technique could use future assess effect antiinflammatory treatment currently develop treatment patient heart attack . The technique could also extend allow label cell type , include stem cell , let u understand cell may contribute repair damaged organ include heart .</brief_summary>
