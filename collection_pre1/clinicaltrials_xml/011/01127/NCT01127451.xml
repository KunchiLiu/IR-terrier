	<brief_title>Study Denileukin Diftitox Patients With Stage IIIC Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , dose/schedule clinical efficacy study patient Stage IIIC Stage IV melanoma . Dose-Schedules : This schedule , dose , pharmacodynamic study Denileukin diftitox patient Stage IIIC Stage IV melanoma . Two arm 40 patient originally plan ( see ) total 80 patient . Patients randomly assign 1 2 arm : 1 . 12 mcg/kg/day Days 1 4 21-day treatment cycle , total 4 cycle ( 12 week ) ; 2 . 12 mcg/kg/day Days 1 , 8 , 15 21-day treatment cycle , total 4 cycle ( 12 week ) . Patients evaluate ( clinical response , safety tolerability , pharmacodynamic measure ONTAK activity . An optional substudy conduct involve collection serial tumor biopsy study entry Day 84 order ass tissue pharmacodynamic marker ONTAK activity ( Treg depletion tumor , appearance melanoma antigen-specific CD8+lymphocytes , marker mucosal immunity inflammatory response ) . Following amendment , patient enrol Arm 1 ( expand total 55 patient ) Arm 2 close . According original design , two response less observed among 22 patient either arm , arm would discontinue . Patients experience clinical benefit ( immune-related stable disease [ irSD ] , immune-related partial response [ irPR ] , immune-related complete response [ irCR ] per irRC ) 4 cycle treatment , may continue denileukin diftitox treatment 8 cycle</detailed_description>
