	<brief_title>RAD001 Plus Carboplatin Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study determine clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) i.e.complete remission ( CR ) + partial remission ( PR ) + stable disease ( SD ) last ≥ 6 month , toxicity RAD001 /carboplatin woman metastatic triple-negative breast cancer . Treatment consist intravenous carboplatin area plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) 6 , later decrease AUC 5 , subsequently AUC 4 every 3 week daily 5mg RAD001 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women metastatic breast cancer ( measurable evaluable include bone metastasis ) Histologically confirm triple negative breast cancer ( estrogen receptor ( ER ) &lt; 10 % , progesterone receptor ( PR ) &lt; 10 % , Her2neu IHC 0 1 FISH negative ) Age &gt; = 18 year World Health Organization performance status &lt; = 2 Adequate bone marrow function show : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : 1. serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 2. international normalize ratio ( INR ) : Patients warfarin INR ≤1.5 ; Patients warfarin INR ≤3 ; Patient stable dose low molecular weight heparin &gt; 2 week time treatment allow . 3. alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Signed informed consent Patients may 03 prior regimen metastatic disease prior bevacizumab ( avastin ) allow . A baseline lung CT ( PET/CT ) O2 sit &gt; = 90 % room air ( &lt; 90 % , spirometry diffusion capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) 50 % normal predict value pulmonary function test ) Negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior start treatment Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 2 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologics ) Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 2 week Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent , except corticosteroid daily dosage equivalent prednisone ≤ 20 mg . However , patient receive corticosteroid must stable dosage regimen minimum 4 week prior first treatment RAD001 . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : 1 . Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV 2. unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease 3. severely impaired lung function define spirometry DLCO 50 % normal predict value and/or 02 saturation 88 % less rest room air 4. uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN 5. active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection 6. liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis . Note : A detailed assessment Hepatitis B/C medical history risk factor must do screening patient . HBV DNA HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction test require screening patient positive medical history base risk factor and/or confirmation prior HBV/HCV infection . A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior administration RAD001 ) Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients know hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients History noncompliance medical regimen Patients unwilling unable comply protocol Ongoing alcohol drug addiction</criteria>
