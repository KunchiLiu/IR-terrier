	<brief_title>Weight-bearing Measuring Device Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthopedic surgeon rehabilitation physician frequently request limited weight-bearing prolong period follow certain bony soft tissue pathology well certain low - limb surgical procedure . Walking , stair climbing , jogging , elliptical training run treadmill common activity injure athlete seek return soon possible follow injury surgery . In order physician able advise regard weight-bearing , Percentage Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing ( PBW/WB ) value increase walk , jog speed , elliptical training must know . These parameter well gait distribution change elude rehabilitation community , mainly due technical inability measure paradigm . There short-term study quantify weight-bearing deficit well weight-bearing gait distribution characteristic follow Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction ( ACLR ) . Furthermore , publish study investigate whether difference exist various surgical procedure replacement graft choice acute- phase ( 0-3 week ) post surgery Descriptive clinical trial . During regular training participant use flexible , light weight , force-sensing insole minute receive parameter 30 subject . The test subject instruct walk normal speed solid ground surface distance 16 meter . The result analyze table normal value establish include average PBW/WB value entire , hind fore-foot well gait distribution change .</detailed_description>
