	<brief_summary>Kidney transplantation live donor show carry many benefit decease donor transplantation . Because benefit shorter wait time improve outcome transplant recipient , live kidney donation account increase number kidney transplant nationwide . Most published study live kidney donation demonstrate procedure safe , also emphasize concern long-term data live donor outcome insufficient . In particular , data concern extent renal function decline donation inadequate . This study measure glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) previous live donor aim accurately describe renal function kidney donation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Live Kidney Donor Study -Renal Function Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study poorly describe renal function kidney donation . Most published study renal function donation base predictive equation , design live kidney donor . One concern use equation may underestimate glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) follow donation . Systematic underestimation GFR may cause previous kidney donor inaccurately categorize chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . While data entire kidney donor population insufficient , even less available information renal function donation black renal donor . In general population , incidence end stage renal disease high among black compare white . Whether pattern carry black renal donor population unclear . The primary objective study accurately measure current GFR ; evaluate change GFR donation ; compare measure GFR donor match race , age , sex , time donation , presence hypertension , presence obesity ; evaluate difference predictive equation measure GFR . This observational study look long term outcome live kidney donor . Participants study also participants DAIT RELIVE-04 . As part study , participant brief medical history take glomerular filtration rate test perform .</detailed_description>
