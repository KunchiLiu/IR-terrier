	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pazopanib hydrochloride surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well pazopanib hydrochloride work give surgery treat patient kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Before Surgery Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate partial nephrectomy patient primary renal tumor otherwise require radical nephrectomy neoadjuvant pazopanib treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tumor diameter/volume change , conversion hilar non-hilar tumor surgical morbidity neoadjuvant pazopanib renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily 18 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo either partial radical nephrectomy least 7 day completion pazopanib hydrochloride . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
