	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose RO4929097 give together capecitabine treat patient refractory solid tumor . RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving RO4929097 together chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) RO4929097 capecitabine administer subject advance solid tumor . ( Part 1 ) II . To describe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) combine RO492097 capecitabine . ( Part 1 ) III . To determine safety RO4929097 capecitabine administer combination . ( Part 1 ) IV . To determine safety RO4929097 capecitabine subject metastatic CRC . ( Part 2a ) V. To evaluate safety RO4929097 capecitabine combination subject HER2/neu negative MBC . ( Part 2b ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical activity RO4929097 capecitabine administer combination subject advance solid tumor . ( Parts 1 , 2a , 2b ) II . To evaluate change expression Notch1 signal pathway member downstream target Notch PCR include HEs1 , 3 5 ; Hey 1 2 treatment RO4929097 MTD expansion cohort . ( Parts 1 , 2a , 2b ) III . To determine pharmacokinetic pharmacogenomic profile combination RO4929097 capecitabine . ( Parts 1 , 2a , 2b ) IV . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) RO4929097 capecitabine administer MTD level patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) history 1 2 prior therapy . ( Part 2a ) V. To determine response overall survival ( OS ) rate follow RO4929097 capecitabine administration MTD level subject metastatic CRC . ( Part 2a ) VI . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) RO4929097 capecitabine administer MTD level subject administer first second line HER2/neu negative metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . ( Part 2b ) V. To determine progression-free overall survival rate follow RO4929097 capecitabine administration MTD level subject HER2/neu negative MBC . ( Part 2b ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 . Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may undergo tumor biopsy treatment biomarker analysis blood sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacogenomic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day ( Part 1 ) every 3 month ( Parts 2a 2b ) .</detailed_description>
