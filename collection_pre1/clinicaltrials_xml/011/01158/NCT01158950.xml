	<brief_summary>In study , seek understand effect tolcapone entacapone , FDA-approved COMT inhibitor , reward choice response inhibition , two measure previously show altered subject alcoholism . We plan test hypothesis COMT regulation cortical dopamine level critical regulation financial choice . Specifically , propose low level cortical dopamine present individual val158val COMT genotype reduces inhibitory effect frontal cortical area impulsive choice ; idea extend previous hypothesis negative consequence decrease prefrontal dopamine level inhibitory control . Moreover , hypothesis suggest inhibit COMT may slow degradation dopamine thereby decrease impulsivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Neural Circuit Responses Catechol-O-methyl Transferase ( COMT ) Inhibitors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug consumption despite adverse consequence define feature human addiction ( DSM-IV-TR , 2004 ) . Impulsivity , tendency choose immediate action despite delayed adverse consequence , major risk factor tobacco , psychostimulant , opioid alcohol abuse . In human , impulsivity quantify presenting subject choice small immediate monetary reward large delay reward . We recently find val158val allele enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) , associate rapid cortical dopamine catabolism thus low cortical dopamine level correlate great impulsivity great fMRI blood oxygen level dependent ( BOLD ) signal dorsolateral prefrontal posterior parietal cortex . The first phase study involve healthy control . The second phase study involve abstinent alcoholic match age , education , gender . Subjects range age 18 50 year old .</detailed_description>
