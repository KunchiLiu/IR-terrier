	<brief_title>PTC299 Treating Young Patients With Refractory Recurrent Primary Central Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate maximum-tolerated dose recommend phase II dose VEGF inhibitor PTC299 ( PTC299 ) pediatric patient recurrent progressive primary central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor . - To evaluate characterize adverse event associate regimen patient . - To evaluate characterize pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics regimen patient . Secondary - To investigate relationship PTC299 plasma exposure outcomes measure . - To evaluate antitumor activity regimen patient . - To evaluate change angiogenic inflammatory marker blood relationship change outcome measure . - To obtain preliminary evidence biologic activity PTC299 use magnetic resonance diffusion assess tumor cellularity . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral VEGF inhibitor PTC299 twice thrice daily . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study ELISA . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
