	<brief_title>Metabolism NNK Among African Americans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer common cause cancer death United States , annual number case estimate 162,460 death per year . It prevalent African Americans compare European Americans . Cigarette smoke cause 90 % lung cancer , major risk factor African Americans European Americans . Tobacco-specific nitrosamines ( TSNA ) among significant carcinogen tobacco product . Multiple international study clearly document occurrence substantial amount carcinogen unburned tobacco tobacco smoke . One prevalent compound , 4- ( methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1-butanone ( NNK ) , present unburned tobacco cigarette smoke , remarkably effective lung carcinogen laboratory animal , induce lung tumor rodents independent route administration . 4- ( Methylnitrosamino ) -1- ( 3-pyridyl ) -1-butanol ( NNAL ) , metabolite NNK , also pulmonary carcinogen . NNK classify International Agency Research Cancer Group 1 carcinogen ( carcinogenic human ) . Consistent , 2 recent study group demonstrate level NNAL serum urine relate lung cancer smoker . Our primary aim conduct comprehensive analysis urinary biomarkers NNK metabolic activation detoxification African American European American smoker . We hypothesize , adjustment smoke level , relative contribution biomarkers NNK metabolic activation total amount NNK metabolites high African Americans compare European Americans . Our secondary aim measure exfoliate oral mucosa cell African American European American smoker DNA adduct form result NNK metabolic activation . The result measurement offer direct measure NNK-induced DNA damage smoker , critical understanding balance urinary excretion NNK metabolites extent NNK DNA binding . We hypothesize African Americans DNA oral mucosa cell high level NNK-derived DNA adduct compare European Americans . Finally , investigate relationship level NNK-derived DNA adduct measure oral mucosa cell rate repair adduct culture lymphocytes subject . These measurement allow u evaluate fully role variation NNK metabolism observe difference lung cancer risk European American African American smoker . We expect African Americans low capacity repair NNK-induced DNA damage compare European Americans , correlate high level NNK-derived buccal DNA adduct .</detailed_description>
