	<brief_summary>Rupture brain aneurysms common cause death disability , account many 10 % stroke case United States . While much result injury nervous system cause initial bleeding aneurysm , many patient develop cerebral vasospasm , pathological constriction blood vessel supply brain , several day follow hemorrhage . As many third patient suffer result neurological deficit stroke , presumably cause decreased blood flow brain ( ischemia ) . This delayed brain injury account significant percentage poor outcome follow aneurysm rupture . Studies show remote ischemia many organ precondition tissue ( include brain ) tolerant decrease blood flow . This `` remote ischemic preconditioning '' promise protect brain ischemic injury . Whereas form stroke onset ischemia predict general population , follow aneurysm rupture investigator know patient likely develop vasospasm . Therefore , ischemic preconditioning follow aneurysm rupture may help prevent ischemic injury cause vasospasm . Remote ischemic preconditioning transient limb ischemia ( produce inflation blood pressure cuff arm leg ) show minimize injury organ , notably heart . Remote ischemic preconditioning brain follow aneurysm rupture yet investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Subarachnoid Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I prospective clinical study evaluate : tolerance clinical subject Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ( SAH ) maneuver involve generation Remote Ischemic Preconditioning ( RIPC ) , immediate delay hemodynamic effect RIPC cerebral vasculature , term Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) velocity , pulsatility index variation , Cerebral Blood Flow ( CBF ) measure , cerebral arterial flow measurement use Magnetic Resonance Imaging flow measurement capability ( MRI NOVA ) . As secondary goal , valuate impact RIPC incidence vasospasm , delayed neurological deficit , development ischemic lesion MRI clinical outcome . Patient Enrollment : Patients admit University California Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Ronald Reagan Medical Center diagnosis aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage consider inclusion study . As standard care condition , follow admission patient ' aneurysm generally treat one two method , surgical clipping endovascular coiling . Following definitive treatment aneurysm , generally perform emergently first 24 48 hour follow hemorrhage , patient consent enrolled study . No patient unprotected ( untreated ) aneurysm enrol . Patients known history lower limb vascular disease lower limb vascular bypass surgery exclude . Remote Ischemic Preconditioning ( RIPC ) Procedure : Following enrollment , patient receive four round lower limb remote ischemic preconditioning , start early post-hemorrhage day possible follow definitive treatment aneurysm . The remote ischemic preconditioning typically take place post-hemorrhage day 2 , 3 , 6 9 . Each cycle RIPC consist four 5-minute cycle low limb ischemia follow 5-minute period reperfusion . A large blood pressure cuff wrap around upper thigh one leg . The cuff inflate pressure 20 mm Hg great systolic arterial blood pressure measure patient 's arterial line upper limb blood pressure cuff . The adequate level inflation confirm absence pulse ipsilateral pedal artery detect Doppler . The cuff remain inflated 5 minute . The cuff deflate limb allow re-perfuse least 5 minute . After cuff deflate , procedure repeat three time total four cycle . Evaluation Tolerance RIPC Maneuvers : The patient continuously monitor pain discomfort RIPC session . If patient pain 6 traditional 1-10 scale patient express desire stop maneuver , procedure stop , data regard number duration maneuver record . A down-escalation treatment propose , reduce number cuff inflation 3 2 , tolerate . Hemodynamic evaluation effect RIPC Maneuvers : Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) measurement perform RIPC session . TCD Cerebral Blood Flow ( CBF ) measurement perform 24 hour 72 hour treatment . Cerebral arterial flow magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI NOVA ) measure first day treatment 72 hour treatment patient suitable transport MRI scan per Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) clinical team criterion . Clinical assessment patient perform daily discharge ICU Treatment subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) Vasospasm : Aside RIPC procedure , treatment monitoring patient standard care treatment patient subarachnoid hemorrhage hospital . Patients undergo neurological monitoring intensive care unit . Monitoring cerebral vasospasm , include transcranial Doppler study , angiogram , cerebral blood flow study , Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan regular neurological examination perform standard . Likewise , prophylaxis treatment vasospasm complication subarachnoid hemorrhage perform usual , standard care . Apart round RIPC , way monitoring treatment patient differ patient enrol study . Data Collection : Patients ' clinical data collect password-protected study computer database . General patient demographic , past medical history , history present illness , Hunt &amp; Hess grade , admission Glasgow coma score , modify Rankin score , size location aneurysm , date subarachnoid hemorrhage aneurysm treatment , type aneurysm treatment , transcranial Doppler study value , cerebral blood flow measurement , result clinical examination note record study database . Additionally , clinical imaging study perform ( include CT scan , MRI scan cerebral angiogram ) review finding note . Specifically , size location aneurysm , extent location subarachnoid hemorrhage , Fisher grade , presence size ischemic brain lesion note . Clinical complication outcomes record , include occurrence angiographic vasospasm delay neurological deficit condition discharge follow-up ( Glasgow outcome score modified Rankin score ) . Any complication associate RIPC procedure note report appropriately .</detailed_description>
