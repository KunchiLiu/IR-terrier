	<brief_summary>Iron overload , define operationally much iron body , develop consequence many blood transfusion give , due genetic defect hereditary hemochromatosis ) . Iron accumulate several organ body , heart , liver , endocrine gland ( pancreas , thyroid , etc . ) , spleen . Excessive iron damage organ may even cause death . Iron overload need appropriately monitor treat avoid unnecessary morbidity mortality . The present study , GENIOS , propose test prospectively hypothesis genetic modifier influence iron overload status patient receive transfusion . To test hypothesis , study perform genetic study investigate possible genetic influence iron accumulation body study iron accumulation liver , also heart , pancreas , kidney , spleen . In addition : study investigate gene role treatment iron overload , word , certain genetic mutation influence iron exit body . This study also investigate substance know control traffic iron body damaging effect tissue ( hepcidin non transferrin-bound iron ) link accumulation iron heart liver . Iron body measure R2*MRI liver biopsy require . Genetic study do specialized test use peripheral blood DNA . Iron accumulate differently different people different organ body . Some people accumulate iron faster others , even receive number blood transfusion</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study focus follow primary objective : - To investigate association GSTM1 gene deletion liver iron concentration patient sickle cell disease transfusional iron-overload . The Secondary Objectives study : - To explore role iron metabolism-associated candidate gene liver iron concentration sickle cell patient transfusional iron-overload . - To explore role GSTM1 genotypes iron metabolism-associated candidate gene maintenance decline liver iron concentration patient sickle cell disease transfusional iron-overload . - To explore role GSTM1 genotypes iron metabolism-associated candidate gene increase , maintenance , decline iron concentration heart , pancreas , kidney , spleen patient sickle cell disease transfusional iron overload . - To explore role GSTM1 gene deletion iron metabolism-associated candidate gene increase , maintenance , decline iron concentration liver , heart , pancreas , kidney , spleen non-sickle cell patient transfusional iron-overload . - To explore relationship Non-Transferrin Bound Iron ( NTBI ) , hepcidin , organ function , iron increase , maintenance , decline liver , heart , pancreas , kidney , spleen patient transfusional iron overload .</detailed_description>
