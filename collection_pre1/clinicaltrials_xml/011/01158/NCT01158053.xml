	<brief_summary>The present prospective , multicenter study therefore perform primary objective establish correlation fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) intravascular ultrasound virtual histology ( VH-IVUS ) -derived parameter angiographically intermediate coronary lesion . The current study also examine relative prognostic utility FFR VH-IVUS tool defer percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , assess long-term rate ( 3 year ) lesion-related clinical event defer FFR vs. VH-IVUS versus defer PCI .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patientspecific inclusion criterion : 1 . Clinical presentation : stable angina , unstable angina , nonST segmentelevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) ( Braunwald classification unstable angina , see Attachment 2 ) recent STEMI ( &gt; 48 hour enrollment ) . 2 . Patient schedule coronary catheterization without percutaneous coronary intervention . 3 . Age ≥18 year . 4 . Patient able read , understand , sign inform consent document . 5 . Patient agrees protocol related procedure , include followup 3 year . Lesionspecific inclusion criterion : 1 . The patient least one intermediate coronary lesion assess FFR VHIVUS , define lesion visuallyestimated diameter stenosis ≥40 % &lt; 80 % visuallyestimated angiographic reference segment diameter 2.75 mm 4.0 mm . 2 . There may one study lesion major epicardial coronary artery branch . All stenosis epicardial coronary artery branch must &lt; 40 % visual angiographic assessment . E.g.. , lesion Left Anterior Descending ( LAD ) , may significant lesion ( ≥40 % ) LAD , septals diagonal branch . A single lesion may normal nearly normal appear segment within lesion long contain within one CASS segment . Moreover , single lesion may span two CASS segment long normal nearly normal appear segment &gt; 5mm length within lesion . However , diseased lesion extend across two CASS segment one &gt; 5 mm length normal nearly normal appear segment within lesion , consider 2 separate lesion , may enrol . 3 . More 1 intermediate lesion per patient may enrol , long lesion meet entry criterion study lesion ( e.g . one intermediate lesion 1 , 2 3 unique epicardial coronary artery ( LAD vs. LCX vs. RCA ) , FFR VHIVUS perform vessel . Thus , 3 lesion may enrol per patient ( one major epicardial coronary artery ) . 4 . PCI lesion target vessel ( main epicardial coronary artery branch ) may perform precede 1 year ( include index procedure ) may plan within next 1 year . 5 . Patients undergo PCI nonstudy lesion nonstudy target vessel index procedure may enrol one qualify intermediate lesion otherwise present different epicardial vessel , PCI nonstudy lesion must perform first ( include stag procedure ) must successful uncomplicated formal enrollment study . The PCI occur epicardial coronary artery branch contain intermediate lesion . Successful PCI define residual diameter stenosis &lt; 50 % treated lesion Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) 3 flow treat vessel . Uncomplicated PCI define absence intraprocedural chest pain STsegment change last &gt; 10 minute , sustain vessel closure , slow reflow , side branch loss , distal embolization , perforation , residual dissection ( &gt; type B ) , requirement cardiopulmonary resuscitation , cardioversion defibrillation , pacemaker insertion , intubation , intraaortic balloon insertion intravenous pressor . Patientspecific exclusion criterion : 1 . Prior CABG time . 2 . The patient likely undergo PCI , CABG cardiac surgical procedure within 1 year procedure . 3 . STsegment elevation myocardial infarction within 48 hour procedure . 4 . Cardiogenic shock define systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg last &gt; 30 minute , respond intravenous fluid , and/or require intravenous pressor intraaortic balloon pump hemodynamic support device . 5 . Heart failure define New York Heart Association class III IV ( see Attachment 2 ) . 6 . Respiratory failure require intubation supplementary oxygen . 7 . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 % determine 2D echo , nuclear testing , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , leave ventriculography . 8 . Any moderate severe cardiac valve disease . 9 . Cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within past 60 day , permanent neurologic deficit . 10 . Chronic renal insufficiency ( serum creatinine &gt; 2.5mg/dl ) . 11 . History drug abuse alcohol abuse condition make unlikely patient comply study procedure , include followup 3 year 12 . Any condition expect survival &lt; 2 year . 13 . Pregnant nursing patient plan pregnancy period 1 year follow index procedure . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test do within 7 day prior index procedure . 14 . Patients currently participate another study investigational drug device yet reach primary endpoint . 15 . Oral intake patient caffeinated beverage within 4 hour procedure 16 . Use within 12 hour theophylline , aminophylline xanthine derivative . Lesionspecific exclusion criterion : 1 . An unprotected left main coronary stenosis present ( visually assess % DS ≥40 % , whether require treatment ) . The study lesion leave main lesion . 2 . The intermediate lesion vessel thrombus , moderate severe calcification , angulation , tortuosity . PCI may perform non target vessel lesion prior study enrollment , however , long successful uncomplicated , patient enrol study . 3 . The study lesion ostial lesion ( within 5 mm aorta distal leave main coronary artery ) bifurcation lesion require plan dual stenting .</criteria>
