	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well sorafenib tosylate work treat patient relapsed esophageal cancer and/or stomach cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib . ICORG 06-41 , V4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine disease control rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ) sorafenib tosylate 4 month patient relapse esophageal gastric adenocarcinoma previously treat platinum-based chemotherapy . Secondary - To determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . - To determine overall survival patient treated drug . - To determine time tumor progression patient treat drug . - To determine objective response rate patient treat drug . - To determine tolerability toxicity patient treated drug . - To assess biomarkers associate response/resistance therapy . ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice day day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor sample may collect periodically analyzed biological marker . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
