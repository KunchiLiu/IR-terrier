	<brief_title>Antithrombin III Supplementation Cardiopulmonary Bypass Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : ATIII supplementation prior initiation cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) neonates safe result less postoperative bleeding transfusion pack red blood cell ( pRBC ) compare placebo control . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine safety feasibility ATIII supplementation prior initiation CPB neonates . 2 . To determine pharmacokinetics ATIII supplementation prior initiation CPB neonates 3 . To compare postoperative blood loss pRBC transfusion requirement experimental group neonates undergo surgery require CPB receive ATIII prior initiation CPB placebo control group receive ATIII . Inclusion Criteria : All sequential neonate ( 4-30 day age ) undergoing surgery require CPB CHW eligible include study . Exclusion Criteria : Patients prior operation utilize CPB , weight less 2 kilogram , prematurity le 37 week estimate gestational age , previously diagnose pro-thrombotic hemorrhagic disorder , know intracranial hemorrhage , prior ATIII supplementation , prior therapeutic anticoagulant use . Protocol : After informed consent , patient risk stratify two group base whether plan surgery result cyanotic acyanotic palliation . The patient two group randomize either ATIII group placebo group . A preoperative ATIII blood level obtain . This level guide dose ATIII placebo , neonatal congenital heart disease patient variable baseline ATIII level . The dose ATIII placebo determine follow formula , order obtain ATIII blood level similar adult old child ( 1.0 U/mL ) : ATIII dose give patient ( U ) = [ ( 1.0 U/mL - patient 's measure ATIII concentration U/mL ) X weight ( kg ) X 80 mL/kg ] This formula derive take account volume distribution ATIII patient 's blood volume . 80 mL/kg average blood volume infant . 1.0 U/ml normal level old child adult , target level try achieve . The patient 's baseline level subtract target level determine relative ATIII deficiency term U/mL . That amount multiply estimate blood volume 80 mL/kg patient 's weight kg determine ATIII dose Units . The CHW pharmacy use formula obtain appropriate dose ATIII placebo patient . ATIII placebo administer induction general anesthesia prior administration heparin initiation CPB . All treat physician study personal except prepare pharmacist blind . Heparin management CPB accomplish accord current standard practice CHW . Anticoagulation bypass monitor titrate use Medtronic HepconÂ® HMS Plus Hemostasis Management System . A 3mL sample patient 's blood drawn pre-incision , ATIII placebo dosing , use HMS device determine vitro individual response heparin . A patient-specific heparin dose 300 800 units/kg administer initiation CPB , appropriate level anticoagulation maintain minimum activated clotting time ( ACT ) 480 second . The level anticoagulation measure every half hour CPB , additional dos heparin periodically administer dictate HMS System measurement . At completion CPB , heparin reverse patient-specific protamine dose , calculate HMS System . Repeat measurement ACT heparin level HMS device do protamine administration insure adequate reversal heparin effect . ATIII level measure within 5-10 minute administration ( prior start CPB ) , within 30 minute start CPB , prior discontinuation CPB ( prior protamine dosing ) , upon admission ICU . These level keep blind treat physician study personal . An additional 2 mL blood drawn time ATIII level obtain ( total 10 mL ) measure marker activation coagulation inflammatory system , order well characterize derangement patient population time . We intend use result develop future study . Intraoperative blood loss CPB machine collect place back CPB circuit per standard practice CHW . Blood loss ( mL/kg ) determine intraoperatively 10 minute protamine administration admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Chest tube output record measure blood loss first 24 hour admission ICU . After admission ICU , transfusion protocol use ensure common indication blood product replacement . Patients transfuse pRBC ( 10-15 mL/kg ) hematocrit le 42 % ( high target evidence inadequate oxygen delivery low SvO2 , decrease cerebral NIRS , rise lactate , etc. ) . This protocol consistent current standard practice CHW . If bedside clinician decides transfusion is/is indicate outside guideline , record protocol variation analyze inclusively separately . Volume whole blood transfuse multiply 0.5 , concentration red blood cell whole blood 0.5 time concentration present pack red blood cell . Additional serum blood sample draw preoperatively postoperatively ( day last invasive line place 28 day postoperatively whichever first ) determine antibody formation recombinant antithrombin goat milk proteins measure safety specific ATIII product use . Data Collection , Analysis , Power Calculation : Data record standardize data collection form store RedCap data base allow menu driven option , inbuilt check generation report . Safety ( Aim 1 ) : We hypothesize measurement safety experimental group less placebo control We record mortality rate , incidence extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) support within 24 hour postoperatively , incidence mediastinal exploration bleed indication within 24 hour postoperatively , incidence thrombotic disease discharge ( ultrasound radiographic evidence obtain routine patient care ) , incidence intracranial hemorrhage ( ultrasound compute tomography obtain routine patient care ) , day delay sternal closure , day cessation mechanical ventilation , day hospital discharge experimental control group . We compare data use chi-square categorical data , t-test continuous data , Kaplan Meir curve Wilcoxon rank sum test censor data . We also compare serum sample baseline postoperatively antibody formation recombinant antithrombin goat milk protein . An internal data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) place review safety study every patient first five , every subsequent five patient . In addition , DSMB convene review serious adverse event potentially relate ATryn administration . A serious adverse event define death , intracranial hemorrhage , &gt; 60 ml/kg/day pRBC transfusion volume and/or 120 ml/kg/day chest tube output ( 2 standard deviation mean historical control ) . At point DSMB plan meet , study place temporary hold , subsequent patient enrol DSMB convenes . If DSMB conclude ATryn administration contribute serious adverse event , rate safety measure describe significantly bad ATryn-treated group time review , study stop . Feasibility ( Aim 1 ) : We hypothesize recruitment rate 5 enrol patient per month . During course project , number subject approach consent , number consent , difficulty measurement ( include unobtainable measure ) summarize overall demographic . Associations investigate scatter plot , Loess smooth curve , Pearson correlation coefficient . ATIII Pharmacokinetics ( Aim 2 ) : ATIII level measure within 5-10 minute administration ( prior start CPB ) , within 30 minute start CPB , prior discontinuation CPB ( prior protamine dosing ) , upon admission ICU assess determine single dose ATIII sustain normal ATIII level experimental group throughout time period , compare placebo control patient . If ATIII level 1.2 ( 20 % high anticipate base dose calculation ) time review DSMB , study place temporary hold order review dose calculation protocol . Postoperative Blood Loss pRBC Transfusion Volume ( Aim 3 ) : Our primary efficacy hypothesis study blood loss pRBC transfusion volume less placebo . Blood loss measure term volume ( mL/kg ) blood loss chest tube output 10 minute protamine administration 24 hour ICU admission . If patient require re-exploration chest first 24 hour postoperatively , volume chest tube output duration exploration record time-weighted average equal chest tube loss 2 hour prior 2 hour exploration . Volumes ( mL/kg ) pack red blood cell 0.5 X volume ( mL/kg ) whole blood transfuse 10 minute protamine administration 24 hour ICU admission record . Patients require ECMO within first 24 hour postoperatively analyze separately , know risk factor increase bleed transfusion support . We compare blood loss pRBC transfusion volume two group use t-test Mann Whitney test . Further , allow demographic sex race , use regression model blood loss pRBC volume outcome group , demographic independent variable . Power analysis : Since two primary outcome blood loss volume pRBC transfusion volume , use Bonferroni adjustment alpha 0.05/2= 0.025 . With 30 patient experimental group 30 control , least 80 % power detect difference 0.81 standard deviation .</detailed_description>
