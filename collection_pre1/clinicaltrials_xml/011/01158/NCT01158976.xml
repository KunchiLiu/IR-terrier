	<detailed_description>Significance : Pregnant woman live poverty often experience chronic stress , consequently high level stress hormone . In utero exposure high level stress hormone negatively affect develop fetus later , infant 's capacity emotion behavioral regulation . In proposal describe develop program research design reduce negative impact prenatal stress infant health development via nutritional supplementation docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) pregnancy . DHA long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member omega-3 fatty acid family . DHA find high concentration neural cell membrane , affect receptor function , neurotransmitter uptake , signal transmission . There grow evidence low level dietary DHA intake associate suboptimal response stress DHA supplementation modulate stress response . Aims : The goal propose study explore whether DHA supplementation pregnancy associate 1 ) reduction maternal perceive stress pregnancy ; 2 ) modulate maternal cortisol response stress stimulus pregnancy , 3 ) optimal regulation emotion behavior infant . Approach : Sixty-five pregnant woman live inner-city poverty , consume less two serving fish per week , randomly assign receive 450 mg/daily DHA placebo begin 16-20 week gestation end pregnancy . Perceived stress , pregnancy related stress , stressful life event , anxiety , depression assess baseline 24 , 30 , 36 week pregnancy 4 month post-partum . DHA level assess baseline 36 week pregnancy . Cortisol response Trier Social Stress Test measure baseline , 24 , 30 week . At 4 month post-partum infant temperament , cognitive development stress reactivity assess laboratory . Investigators : This proposal stem National Institute Mental Health R21 Translational Science Network prenatal stress mental health outcome offspring . Three member network , Drs . Keenan , Carter , Glover , fund investigator area prenatal stress child mental health , prioritize area exploratory research could directly impact clinical care . They collaborate present application . Innovation : This first randomize control study effect DHA supplementation stress response pregnant woman live inner-city poverty , first study maternal DHA supplementation emotion stress regulation infant . Relevance : If DHA supplementation associate reduction perceive stress , modulate maternal cortisol response stress , optimal emotional behavioral regulation infant , even within context inner-city poverty , comprehensive program research mechanisms association evolve potential broad-based prevention poor developmental outcome among child bear woman live poverty launch .</detailed_description>
