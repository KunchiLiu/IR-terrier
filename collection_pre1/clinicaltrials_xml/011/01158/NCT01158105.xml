	<brief_title>Bortezomib Treatment Refractory Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease ( cGVHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Graft vs. host disease represent formidable problem follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation hematological disease . Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) serious common long-term complication treatment patient survive 100 day . Some patient require immunosuppressive therapy year . cGVHD associate high degree morbidity mortality remain major cause late death . When standard treatment steroid ineffective poorly tolerate , effective therapeutic option limit . Patients uncontrolled cGVHD initial therapy include systemic steroid respond poorly second line option . Recent study demonstrate Bortezomib safety prophylaxis , improvement GVHD suggest efficacy.This study do evaluate potential bortezomib treat refractory cGVHD .</detailed_description>
