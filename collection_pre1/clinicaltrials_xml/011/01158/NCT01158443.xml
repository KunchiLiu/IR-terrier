	<brief_summary>This integrated medication/behavioral intervention program increase energy , activity level goal attainment sample HIV+ adult whose present problem include clinically significant fatigue unmet vocational goal . Based previous study , investigator find many patient fail achieve desire goal even though energy restore medication . To address failure goal attainment , investigator evaluate behavioral intervention , originally base Behavioral Activation Treatment Depression , modify Behavioral Activation Program Energy Productivity BA-PEP . The intervention conduct patient experience clinically significant fatigue want work receive work-related training ( pay volunteer , part time full time ) education energy improve medication ( armodafinil ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose integrated medication/behavioral intervention program increase energy , activity level goal attainment sample people HIV/AIDS whose present problem clinically significant fatigue unmet vocational goal . Based recently complete randomized control trial ( RCT ) modafinil ongoing RCT armodafinil , investigator find many patient fail achieve desire goal even though energy restore medication . To address failure goal attainment , team develop pilot behavioral intervention , originally base Behavioral Activation Treatment Depression Lejuez et al . modify Dr. Daughters `` Behavioral Activation Program Energy Productivity , 'BA-PEP ' '' . The intervention conduct patient experience significant fatigue , want work get work-related training education energy improve armodafinil treatment . It intend eventual implementation HIV clinic community agency work development program . The intervention development include formative work pilot study . The formative work comprise in-depth patient interview , focus group provider , Project Advisory Board , separate Work Group . Their input use modify BA-PEP intervention promote achievement goal select patient , fatigue ameliorate armodafinil , adapt attention control supportive counseling intervention . With input , investigator conduct exploratory study use BA-PEP 12 patient responsive armodafinil . After modification , investigator conduct feasibility trial 30 armodafinil-responsive patient randomize 2:1 BA-PEP attention control , supportive counseling . The main behavioral outcome employment taking class ( measure Goal Attainment Scaling methodology ) . Secondary outcome reduce avoidance/increased activation ( measure Behavioral Activation Depression Scale ) , increase environmental interaction ( measure EROS : Environmental Rewards Observation Scale ) . Finally , develop train supervision manual guide implementation .</detailed_description>
