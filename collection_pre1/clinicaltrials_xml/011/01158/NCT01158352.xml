	<brief_summary>Study design : Double blind , randomize , placebo control study.The propose study consist two main segment : 1 . Segment 1 aim assess effect 6-12 month treatment nutritional supplementation standardize formula , short lean prepubertal child weight SDS , height SDS , BMI SDS growth velocity 2 . Segment 2 aim explore eat behavior idiopathic short stature lean prepubertal child sibling normal height body weight find whether difference eat pattern quality life idiopathic short stature lean prepubertal child child normal height body weight Segment 1 Population : 200 subject control recruit segment 1 propose study , 100 group . Participants recruit healthy child refer either institute endocrinology gastroenterology unit , Schneider Children 's Medical Center growth assessment , due low height weight , , gastrointestinal morbidity underlie cause find . Methods : Randomization &amp; Blinding : Participants randomly assign either intervention group placebo control group . Randomization two study group make ratio 1:1 . Both participant study team blind type treatment patient receive first 6 month study . Treatment : Participants intervention group treat nutritional supplementation standardize formula.Participants control group instruct consume volume formula calculate intervention group . Treatment duration : The study divide two treatment period : 6 month intervention versus active placebo follow additional 6 month ( extension period ) , participant intervention group offer extend intervention period participant control arm offer switch intervention group . Study Schedule : Follow visit take place 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month include : 1 . Demographic data , medical history growth data ( month 0 ) : Demographic parameter , include birth date , gender , birth weight length gestational age , medical history growth data , include height velocity , parent 's sibling 's weight height document patient 's file . 2 . Nutritional assessment 3 . Anthropometric assessment ( month 0 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 ) : 1 . Height without shoe 2 . Length 3 . Weight light cloth without shoe 4 . MAC 5 . Body mass index ( BMI ) calculate child 's weight height age gender specific BMI SDS calculate 6 . Body composition assessment use method bioelectrical impedance 4 . Laboratory parameter ( month 0 , 6 12 ) : 5 . Sleeping Questionaire Segment 2 : 86 subject control recruit segment 2 propose study Population : Short lean prepubertal child participate segment 1 study study entry 10th percentile height , weight percentile equal small height percentile . Only participant segment 1 sibling normal height body weight age gender , able participate segment 2 study Control group 1 : Sibling participant segment 1 study , normal height- 25th percentile normal BMI age gender- 5th percentile 85th percentile . Control group 2 : Healthy child community normal height 25th percentile normal BMI age gender 5th percentile 85th percentile Segment 2 study design case- control study focus eat pattern , sleep pattern quality life participant segment 1 time 0 month study , begin nutrition intervention . These finding compare data control group , comprise sibling participant segment 1 , normal height body weight matched age .</brief_summary>
