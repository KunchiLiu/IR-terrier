	<brief_title>Plerixafor Sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) Mobilization Allogeneic Sibling Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose study gather information combination drug plerixafor sargramostim donor blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) . Stem cell take bone marrow pelvic bone blood follow treatment drug call growth factor ; sargramostim drug . Once stem cell leave bone marrow circulate blood , call peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSCs ) . These cell collect routine procedure call apheresis , involve place two IVs arm connect apheresis machine ; machine take blood body , remove stem cell , return blood body . Normally , growth factor call filgrastim give donor order collect stem cell use transplantation . However , stem cell collect use filgrastim transplant patient , possible unpredictable complication graft versus host disease . It 's think use different growth factor sargramostim might reduce occurrence graft versus host disease patient . However , sargramostim alone provide many stem cell transplantation growth factor . Plerixafor another drug increase number PBSCs donor , like sargramostim , plerixafor alone always provide enough stem cell . This sargramostim plerixafor combine study : investigator believe two drug together provide enough stem cell transplantation may also reduce risk graft versus host disease .</detailed_description>
