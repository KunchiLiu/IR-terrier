	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Adherus Dural Sealant System When Used Dural Sealant Cranial Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After surgery head , dura , membrane cover brain , must close order prevent CSF leak outside dura . When CSF leak outside dura , increase risk infection , cause painful headache complication may require another surgery repair leak . Typically , study doctor close dura suture ( surgical stitch ) sometimes piece muscle , fat , soft tissue take another place body . However , still possible CSF continue leak small suture hole even appropriate precaution take . Dural surgical sealant develop assist surgeon stop CSF leak standard measure follow brain surgery effective . Sometimes , leak seal need surgical sealant . This study participants CSF leak standard measure use close dura end surgery . The decision use surgical sealant make surgeon find stitch use standard measure close dura , still leak . However , surgeon find CSF leak applies standard stitch tissue , sign informed consent , randomize receive one two surgical sealant ( Randomized mean like flip coin ) . You select receive either Adherus™ Surgical Sealant DuraSeal™ Surgical Sealant post surgery progress evaluate study visit study test . Adherus™ Surgical Sealant investigational device develop stop CSF leak . It study find effective safe DuraSeal™ . Adherus™ make two component form gel combine . The gel apply study doctor close incision . The gel act thin , elastic barrier intend prevent CSF leak dura tissue properly heal . The gel absorb body several month excrete remove body urine . This second study Adherus™ people United States . If choose participate , screen test see qualify enroll study . Not everyone screen study able participate . The device receive determine random selection process . Neither study personnel doctor decide device receive . You tell device receive study completion . In addition , study doctor use sealant end surgery ( may CSF leak study doctor decide use another closure procedure ) study participation complete . If choose participate screening test qualify enroll study , surgery perform accord regular standard care . If CSF leak dura stitch close study doctor continue meet study entry measure , study doctor apply assign study treatment try stop leak . After surgery , see 4 time next 4 month . You study 5 month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>PreOperative Inclusion Criteria Subject schedule elective cranial procedure involve dural incision use follow surgical locations/approaches ( combination ) : frontal , temporal , occipital , parietal ( i.e . supratentorial ) , and/or midline lateral suboccipital ( i.e . infratentorial . ) Subject require procedure involve Class 1/clean wound ( uninfected surgical wound inflammation encounter ) IntraOperative Inclusion Criteria Subject 's linear extent durotomy ≥2 cm Subject 's dural margin edge bony defect ≥3 mm throughout Subject 's CSF leak present intraoperatively follow completion primary dural closure ( without nonautologous duraplasty autologous tissue ) , either spontaneously upon Valsalva maneuver , 20 cm H2O five ( 5 ) second Subject require procedure involve translabyrinthine , transsphenoidal , transoral approach , procedure penetrates air sinus mastoid air cell . Note : Superficial penetration mastoid air cell exclusion cell appropriately seal ( e.g . bone wax ) . Subject CSF shunt ; ventriculoperitoneal , ventriculopleural , ventriculoatrial lumboperitoneal shunt . Subject external ventricular lumbar CSF drain must leave place surgery . Subject radiation treatment surgical site , standard fractionate radiation therapy plan within ten day post indexprocedure . ( Note : stereotactic radiosurgery prior plan index procedure exclusion criterion ) . Subject systemic infection evidence infection near plan operative site . IntraOperative Exclusion Criteria Subject Incidental find meet preoperative exclusion criterion list . Subject require intraoperative placement CSF diversion device ( e.g . ventricular catheter , subdural catheter , lumbar drain , device design externally evacuate CSF ) leave place procedure . Note : Subgaleal drain use acute postoperative management incision site permit .</criteria>
