	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere growth cancer cell slow growth kidney cancer . Giving celecoxib together recombinant interferon alpha-2b may kill tumor cell effective treatment metastatic kidney cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give celecoxib together recombinant interferon alfa-2b work treat patient metastatic kidney cancer undergone surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Celecoxib Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b Metastatic Kidney Cancer Who Have Undergone Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate objective response rate interferon alpha plus celecoxib metastatic RCC patient 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare cellular immune parameter metastatic RCC patient 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining patient &lt; 1+ tumor immunostaining . II . To evaluate effect celecoxib interferon alpha therapy cellular immune parameter metastatic RCC patient 3+ COX-2 tumor immunostaining . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily recombinant interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously , daily , 5 time week . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
