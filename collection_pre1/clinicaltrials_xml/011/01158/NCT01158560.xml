	<detailed_description>In current study , propose investigate role vitamin D supplementation regular gargle prevent URTI/ILI . Vitamin D may important factor respiratory health . Observational study associate low serum 25 ( OH ) D level frequent severe respiratory infection . However , evidence lack replacement vitamin D decrease respiratory infection . Four interventional study vitamin D supplementation note reduction respiratory infection , estimate 5-25 % reduction , result statistically significant . In Japanese population , gargle find significantly reduce incidence upper respiratory tract infection approximately 35 % ( Satomura et al. , 2005 ) . This intervention study different population may useful personal practice reduce URTI . We propose 2X2 factorial , randomize , placebo-controlled trial vitamin D/placebo gargling/no gargle study effect vitamin D supplementation gargle upper respiratory tract infection McMaster student . This study conduct two year , September October study year , capture natural peak rhinovirus activity .</detailed_description>
