	<brief_summary>This study one three project NIH Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortium . A `` consortium '' group centre share information resource perform research . The consortium research focus brain blood vessel malformation three different rare disease . The focus specific study Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia ( HHT ) . HHT condition characterize blood vessel malformation , call telangiectasia arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) , occur brain , nose , lung , stomach , bowel liver . Brain AVMs ( BAVMs ) HHT difficult study rare , affect approximately 10 % people HHT . While type BAVMs study depth , study HHT population small . Here , propose first large-scale collaboration join 12 HHT Centers Excellence North America perform large study risk factor bleed BAVMs , call intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) HHT patient . The current standard clinical practice across North America , screen HHT patient BAVMs magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If BAVMs detect , patient refer multidisciplinary neurovascular team consideration treatment . Treatment decision make case case basis , balance risk complication BAVM risk therapy , limited study available HHT . We hope knowledge obtain risk factor intracranial bleeding patient large study help u improve care HHT patient . We plan study risk factor rupture BAVMs , include primarily genetics image characteristic BAVMs . Knowledge risk factor help care management HHT patient . This achieve collection health information construct HHT database , blood sample banking ( National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke [ NINDS ] ) , genetic analysis University California San Francisco .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>4 . Study Design Methods In conjunction DMCC , construct relational database web-based data collection instrument ; see Table 1 show site contribute effort . Data include demographic , symptomology , cerebral angioarchitecture , organ involvement HHT gene mutation result . The database use serve Aim 2 Aim 3 also serve platform foster HHT research . The recruitment HHT BAVM case emphasize use 3:1 ratio enrol non-BAVM BAVM HHT case , i.e. , brain AVM recruit , 3 patient without brain AVM recruit . This provide large RDCRN 6203 Cerebral Hemorrhage Risk single sample available also centralize expert neuroradiological adjudication brain phenotype . The study design detail , aim , Section 6 . The data collect detailed Sections 4.5 4.5.1 study schedule detail Section 4.6 . 4.1 . Study Population : The study population include patient HHT , inclusion exclusion criterion detailed section 4.3 . Cases recruit two source : ( ) network HHT Centers Excellence ( Table 1 ) ; ( b ) patient contact study personnel HHT Foundation International learning study HHT Foundation International social network , RDCRN public website , friend , physician , relative , etc . Inclusion exclusion criterion detailed section 4.3 . 4.2 . Case Ascertainment Enrollment As show Table 2 , estimate conservatively 875 case available recruitment five year . Cases derive two source . First , recruit HHT Centers Excellence case currently follow new case pass individual clinic . Ascertainment enrollment use IRB approve , HIPAA-compliant procedure . Each center submit case use web-based form . Second , recruit new case HHT Foundation . The HHT Foundation mail list 5646 family ; approximately 1000 new family add per year . HHT Patients contact HHT Foundation interest participate study direct close participate HHT Center Excellence . The HHT Foundation recruit patient contact HHT Foundation interest participate BAVM arm study affiliate participate center wish visit center participate study . We also enroll non-BAVM HHT case facilitate long-term involvement HHT community systematic , organize rare disease research . We structure database scalable accommodate type HHT . Under supervision site PI , local PI research staff identify obtain informed consent patient clinical information enter master registry . At enrollment , arrangement blood specimen also make . Approximately 20 ml ( 4 teaspoon ) blood drawn ( two ACD tube 8.5 ml ) . If blood draw possible , UCSF core provide bar-coded saliva DNA collection kit . Representative standard clinical imaging study ( MR angiography ) enrol case provide Dr. Karel TerBrugge Toronto Western Hospital adjudication cod angioarchitecture . We conservatively estimate able collect DNA 500 875 project case enrol course study . 4.3 Patient Selection Inclusion Criteria : 1 . ( ) Definite clinical HHT diagnosis ( least 3 Curacao criterion ) genetic diagnosis HHT Curacao criterion : ( ) spontaneous recurrent nosebleed ; ( b ) mucocutaneous telangiectasia characteristic site ( lip , oral cavity , finger nose ) ; ( c ) visceral involvement pulmonary , hepatic CNS BAVM ; ( ) affect first degree relative criterion . ( 65 ) OR ( b ) Definite clinical HHT diagnosis ( least 3 Curacao criterion ) genetic diagnosis HHT Curacao criterion : ( ) spontaneous recurrent nosebleed ; ( b ) mucocutaneous telangiectasia characteristic site ( lip , oral cavity , finger nose ) ; ( c ) visceral involvement pulmonary , hepatic CNS BAVM ; ( ) affect first degree relative criterion . ( 65 ) AND Presence BAVM For purpose study , focus BAVM directly shunt blood arterial venous circulation without intervene capillary bed , include Toronto classification ( 23 ) A-V fistula , `` micro '' BAVMs ( &lt; 1 cm ) 8 `` small '' ( 1-3 cm ) BAVMs , present , large lesion . We include intracranial telangiectasias isolation . 2 . Able provide inform consent Exclusion Criteria : None 4.4 Recruitment Informed Consent The prospective HHT population consist patient see evaluation treatment HHT . Health status patient encompass spectrum disability encounter disease process study . The Human Subjects Committee/Institutional Review Board clinical center approve informed consent form . A copy letter approval IRB/REB copy consent form file DMCC clinical center allow initiate enrollment . The informed consent include objective study , description screen process , potential risk benefit , cost patient , alternative participation liability particular participate center . All patient diagnose HHT , regardless gender , race ethnicity , potential candidate RDCRC . To best knowledge , race-ethnicity predilection HHT sporadic BAVMs . 4.5 Data Sample Collection Development A detailed table relevant field data type range construct combine element use HHT community field collect ongoing study sporadic BAVM . We use data table departure point work DMCC construct relational database project well data web entry form . Database issue also address GSAC AU section . All recruit participant assign Database study ID . The link patient identify information database study ID maintain recruit center . Data enter web-based system central Database develop DMCC . Only de-identified information enter central Database . 4.5.1 Detailed Clinical Radiographic Information Collected Information collect include attribute systemic manifestation HHT focus brain vascular phenotype . Detailed table data field data web entry form available Site PI , Project Leader , DMCC . The Clinical data element include demographic information well specific clinical information clinical feature complication BAVMs , well organ AVMs complication related HHT . The Neuroradiological element include information angiographic feature , clinical presentation , complication treatment BAVMs . This data collect baseline . Every year recruitment , , participant contact recruit Center collect limit follow-up data set , regard treatment complication BAVMs mortal status . The diagnosis BAVM make refer center adjudicate Dr. TerBrugge base submit imaging study . All image study abstract supervision consultant neuroradiologist , Dr. TerBrugge . The image source date CT , MRI , MR angiography , diagnostic cerebral angiography furnish primary descriptor include side , nidus size , anatomic location , `` eloquence , '' feed artery , arterial aneurysm , number lesion , venous drainage pattern . Additional factor include location , presence intra- extranidal aneurysm , presence venous stenosis , describe Writing Group paper . New AVM hemorrhage bleed brain surrounding space likely associate AVM ( age location hemorrhage also estimate ) . The time diagnosis new hemorrhage use survival analysis . We also record potential source co-morbidity , include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , smoke history , hyperlipidemia , i.e. , factor may non-specifically increase risk hemorrhage . Although functional status part primary aim , record Modified Rankin Score ( mRS ) ( 66-68 ) ( adapt ISAT trial patient question ( 69 ) ) cod : 0 = symptom cope well life ; 1 = symptom interfere everyday life ; 2 = symptom change life I still able look ; 3 = symptom significantly change life , I need help look ; 4 = quite severe symptom , I need help people ; 5 = major symptom severely handicap I need constant attention day night ; death cod 6 . The mRS record least patient status time BAVM discovery last available date . For retrospective case , estimate use available clinical record ; prospective case , last available status project period assess . New ICH follow-up also record . Working DMCC , institute web-based system facilitate data entry . The main follow-up target complete fifth year RDCRC project include : ( ) date nature treatment ; ( b ) new hemorrhagic event ; ( c ) modify Rankin score . 4.5.2 Sample Collection , Processing Banking Each site arrange obtain blood sample BAVM case , accommodate banking sample HHT patient without BAVM exploratory analysis . Blood sample collect send directly Coriell/NINDS Human Genetics DNA Cell Line Repository use publish instruction ( http : //ccr.coriell.org ) . Coriell retain DNA also release DNA sample study investigator UCSF , store well . The advantage use Coriell/NINDS ( 1 ) 20 μg genomic DNA make available researcher additional charge , ( 2 ) lymphocytes immortalized , ensure durable renewable supply DNA future study . The PI work NINDS/Coriell ; send approximately 100 sporadic brain AVM case NINDS DNA bank . For case unable blood drawn , use commercially available saliva mail kit ( Oragene ) . The kit send Study Coordinator instruction use , consent form , return mail box pre-printed postage shipping label . The specimen label study ID number , send directly UCSF process DNA extraction . We use excellent DNA yield genotyping result . Such sample would handle directly UCSF Genetics Statistical Analysis Core ( GSAC ) . The Specimen study ID number assign separately Database study ID number . Samples retain DNA use . If sample remain study complete , study investigator may use sample future research study genetic factor brain AVMs aspects HHT .</detailed_description>
