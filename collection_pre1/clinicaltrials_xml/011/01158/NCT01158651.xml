	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn study drug RAD001 shrink slow growth low-grade glioma child NF1 . Additionally , safety RAD001 study . The study drug , RAD001 , drug may act directly tumor cell prevent tumor cell growth development . RAD001 study participant various type cancer single agent ( drug use alone treat cancer ) combination number well know anticancer therapy . Information research study suggest RAD001 may help shrink slow growth low-grade glioma . In research study , investigator look see response RAD001 child low-grade glioma NF1 either respond treatment come back treatment . We also look high dose RAD001 give safely patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After sign consent form , ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . These test procedure likely part regular glioma care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . A medical history , involve question health history , medication take plan take , allergy . A physical exam , ask problem might . Additionally , clinician check vital sign ( body temperature , heart rate , breathe rate , blood pressure ) bodily system ( respiratory , nervous , digestive , etc ) . The doctor also evaluate performance status , indicate much illness affect activity level . Blood test , include test measure effect disease . Approximately 1-2 teaspoon blood drawn test . Urine test , do make sure kidney function properly . An assessment tumor use scan brain . MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) use look evaluate tumor . An Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , measure electrical activity heart A pregnancy test female childbearing potential . A small amount blood ( half teaspoon ) urine draw test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study .</detailed_description>
