	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility intermittent sunitinib therapy patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical outcome ( response rate overall progression-free survival ) metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient treat intermittent sunitinib therapy . II . To evaluate toxicity intermittent sunitinib therapy patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma . III . To assess feasibility detect circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) RCC patient investigate association VEGF -634 genotype occurrence hypertension sunitinib-treated RCC patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Sunitinib dose schedule may change 14 day follow 7 day , repeat 6-week cycle , discretion treat physician toxicity purpose . Cycles define 6 week interval regardless dose interruption . All patient treat 4 cycle absence unacceptable toxicity RECIST-defined progressive disease .</detailed_description>
