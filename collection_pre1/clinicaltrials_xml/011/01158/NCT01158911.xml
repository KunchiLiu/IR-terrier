	<brief_summary>Patients earlier stage Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) risk development end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( define requirement dialysis kidney transplantation ) development cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Although controversial , literature suggest uric acid may play role progression kidney disease development cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) Study randomize control trial patient CKD , examine effect dietary protein restriction strict blood pressure control progression non-diabetic CKD . Extensive data risk factor progression kidney disease development CVD available , long term follow . 838 840 patient randomize uric acid level measure baseline . The aims present study examine determinant uric acid cross sectional analysis baseline , determine association uric acid development ESRD , association uric acid all-cause CVD mortality . Level kidney function major determinant uric acid level independent risk factor . Level uric acid associate development ESRD independent level kidney function risk factor . Uric Acid level associate all-cause CVD mortality independent kidney function risk factor .</brief_summary>
