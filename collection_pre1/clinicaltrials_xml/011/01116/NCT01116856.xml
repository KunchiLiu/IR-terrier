	<brief_summary>At present time , scientific consensus exist obesity multifactorial etiopatogenia . As well , professional researcher agree treatment must approach several scope , dietetic , physical activity , pharmacologic surgical . These two last one first election must reserve case morbid obesity case previous one fail . The combination diet exercise still sufficiently study , special , addition strength training , propose project , establish intervention protocol exist , could suppose additional benefit reduction risk factor . Therefore , objective aim project enumerate : - To discover effective training protocol determine type exercise combine nutrition appropriate obesity intervention program . - To establish relationship marker relate cardiovascular risk ( adopokines lipid profile ) different intervention protocol propose . - To describe influence nine genetic polymorphism ( select relationship energy expense physical yield ) effect different training protocol . - To determine important body composition ( fat mass muscle mass mainly ) total daily energy expenditure . - To establish rule nutritional exercise intervention apply public private training center . If propose objective fulfil , would contribute improvement patient health long term , along enormous save public health . Therefore , purpose project propose new line intervention overweight obese adult , , little investigated . This way , resistance training propose combination cardiovascular training endocrinologic treatment . It fit emphasize , far know , first project characteristic , put touch public private sector ( hospital , university fitness area ) , establish standardized relation protocols allow close pursuit obese patient .</brief_summary>
