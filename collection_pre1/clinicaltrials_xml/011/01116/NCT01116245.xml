	<detailed_description>Worldwide , many woman carry HPV cervical cancer lead cancer killer woman age 50 . Although consequence considerably less severe US , lead considerable morbidity . Many publish clinical trial describe immunotherapeutic treatment early stage , pre-invasive , cervical cancer . It widely recognize immunotherapy effective early stage disease immune system least debilitated disease burden low . Invasive cervical cancer precede long , slowly progressive , pre-invasive phase term Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( CIN ) , allow therapeutic approach . An ideal therapy would result remission CIN 2/3 without damage cervical tissue . A National Institute Cancer panel charge achieve consensus issue conclude non-surgical medical treatment indication would valuable The primary objective trial test three dos Lovaxin C determine vaccination Lovaxin C woman CIN 2/3 surgery indicate safely reverse disease compare placebo treat control patient . An early Phase 1/2 trial Lovaxin-C late stage metastatic cervical cancer use regimen two dos give 28-day interval . That regimen show safe generate reduction tumor burden patient . In trial treat earlier stage disease healthy patient well immune system , use low dos give , add additional dose regimen administer low dose assess previously add third vaccination prior regimen . Unlike phase 1 trial 2 dos give 3 week separation , dose propose trial separate 4-week interval .</detailed_description>
