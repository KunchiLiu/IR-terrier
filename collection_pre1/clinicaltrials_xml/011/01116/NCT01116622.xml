	<detailed_description>This single institution open label dose-ranging trial . Consecutive , eligible patient present diagnosis advance aerodigestive tract malignancy enrol study . All eligible patient receive continuous daily oral erlotinib ( Tarceva™ ) daily bexarotene oral capsule ( Targretin® ) . The two agent take time . Three dose level daily bexarotene combination daily erlotinib study . Eligible patient enter cohort three dose level . Doses escalate course treatment individual patient .
