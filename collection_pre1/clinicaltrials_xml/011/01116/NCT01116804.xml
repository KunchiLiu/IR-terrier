	<brief_summary>Present image modality primary liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma HCC ) several shortcoming . One important shortcoming time delay successful treatment radiological confirmation response . Often take several month anatomical change occur appreciated morphological imaging CT MRI ( shrinkage tumor , absence contrast enhancement ) . Functional imaging mean Fluor-18 deoxyglucose Fluor-18 Choline ( positron emitter , PET-scan ) might early indicator response . This `` early '' information might help tailor treatment . For instance , response induce , early switch therapy plan . The present study investigate whether routine PET-tracer ( Fluor-18 deoxyglucose ) experimental PET-tracer , Fluor-18 Choline help predict response patient inoperable primary liver cancer treat ( radionuclide therapy , biologicals ) .</brief_summary>
