	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Stroke With AMES + EMG Biofeedback</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last 20 year , discovery cortical plasticity adult human brain lead development new therapy rehabilitate stroke survivor whose recovery motor function stall conventional therapeutic methodology . However , efficacy new therapy appear limited relatively high-functioning chronic stroke patient . A therapeutic approach may efficacious restore functional movement low-functioning chronic stroke patient `` AMES , '' stand Assisted Movement Enhanced Sensation . Despite efficacy AMES restore movement low-functioning hemiparetic stroke patient , plegia joint tend recover movement plegic direction AMES treatment rehabilitation therapy . The objective study determine AMES treatment combination biofeedback helpful restore functional movement plegic stroke patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Hemispheric stroke ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) , cortical subcortical , document either CT MRI scan associate residual upper extremity weakness . Chronic stroke , occur ≥12 month prior subject enrollment . Age 1880 year old . Inability move finger affect hand 5.0 cm extension . Fingerandwrist impedance ≤3 Modified Ashworth Scale . Measureable EMG ( &gt; 2 x baseline ) long finger extensor muscle attempt hand open closing . Physically cognitively capable consent comply protocol ( base exam Study Physician ) . Subject must physically capable communicate informed consent must accompany legally authorize representative provide inform consent . Complete flaccidity affect arm . Significant upper extremity proprioceptive deficit ( &lt; 70 % correct detection direction passive finger movement eye close ) . Pathological neurological/physical condition , stroke , impair function impair arm resulting pain arm . Spinal cord injury , arthritis , fracture affect arm result loss range motion . Peripheral nerve injury neuropathy result significant motor sensory loss test arm . Cardiopulmonary compromise include limit uncontrolled hypertension angina , deep vein thrombosis , decompensated congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , heart irregularity , exercise intolerance . Major active psychiatric disorder . Cognitively behaviorally unable follow instruction include severe apraxia ; inability understand verbal ( English ) direction , inability communicate adequately study personnel . Size arm incompatible AMES device ( checked placing limb device ) . Severe contracture decrease range motion skin condition would prohibit comfortable position tolerance device vibrator . Any progressive neurodegenerative disorder affect upper extremity motor system . Uncontrolled seizure disorder . Current abuse alcohol drug . Terminal illness anticipate survival &lt; 12 month . Current plan concurrent participation another study involve therapy impair arm Planned initiation cessation kind clinical therapy impair limb prior AMES treatment period . NIH Stroke Scale , follow score : Sensory Item score &gt; 1 ; Neglect involve affect limb score &gt; 1 . Intent receive Botox injection ( 5 month prior enrollment ) , initiation antispasmodic medication , use robotic ( e.g. , MANUS , Locomat ) electrical vibratory stimulation device ( e.g. , Bioness ) participate AMES trial . Cognitively behaviorally unable follow instruction</criteria>
