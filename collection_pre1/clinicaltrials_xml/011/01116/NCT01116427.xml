	<detailed_description>MS chronic autoimmune disease blood cell suppose protect body infection mistakenly attack body 's tissue . In MS , target attack protein call myelin coat nerve throughout body . Damage protective layer lead loss neurologic function . There number treatment available MS patient . Interferon beta , Copaxone , drug delay worsen disease patient . For patient , aggressive treatment chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide azathioprine need . These drug attempt slow disease limit activity entire immune system . Because , often serious side effect . This study evaluate efficacy abatacept treatment relapsing-remitting MS . In first phase study , participant receive 8 intravenous treatment period 24 week . Then , participant remain eligible , enter second phase study receive another 8 treatment follow 24 week . Two-thirds ( 2 3 ) participant receive study drug abatacept first phase , inactive form ( placebo ) drug second phase . The remain one-third ( 1 3 ) get placebo first , study drug second phase remain eligible . Therefore , participant ACCLAIM trial opportunity receive study drug abatacept remain healthy study . Participants ask return follow-up visit 12 week treatment complete . Regular appointment schedule trial use monitor participant ' health progress study . These appointment include : physical neurological exam , blood test motor function assessment . A total 11 magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) procedure schedule study . The study medication procedure relate study provide expense participant .</detailed_description>
