	<brief_title>Treatment Atraumatic Rotator Cuff Rupture Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct accord revise Declaration Helsinki The World Medical Association ICH-guidelines good clinical trial practice . The study submit approval Ethics Committee Hospital District Varsinais-Suomi , Finland . A write informed consent obtain patient . This study conduct three different hospital i.e . Turku University Hospital , Tampere University Hospital ( Hatanpää hospital ) Kuopio University Hospital multicenter study . A total 180 patient , 60 patient hospital , include study . The patient clinically examine routine x-ray MRI-investigation performed . Patients must atraumatic degenerative supraspinatus tendon rupture comprise less 2/3 tendon insertion , i.e . 1/3 tendon insertion must intact . The rupture must document MRI investigation . Patients must willing give write informed consent . After recruitment patient randomize one three study treatment modality . The randomization make clinical MRI investigation neutral attendant use sealed envelope . 60 identical envelope ( 20 per group ) make center . The Constant score use primary outcome measure . The Constant score measure patient right treatment intervention three six month , one , two five year intervention . The intervention group design cumulative fashion : structured standardized physiotherapy treatment proceeds gradually patient ( group 1,2,3 ) , addition physiotherapy patient group 2 treat acromioplasty , patient group 3 acromioplasty rotator cuff reconstruction .</detailed_description>
