	<brief_summary>Protein-energy wasting , reflect serum albumin &lt; 4.0 g/dL , common maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) patient associate poor clinical outcome include high death rate . Hyperphosphatemia , reflect serum phosphorus level &gt; 5.5 mg/dL , also common disorder associate increase death risk population . The traditional dietary intervention control hyperphosphatemia restrict protein intake . This , however , may worsen protein-energy wasting recently show large epidemiologic data , indicate best survival observe MHD patient increase protein intake serum phosphorus could control . We hypothesize provision high protein diet possible potent phosphorus binder ( Fosreonlâ„¢ ) prescribe simultaneously . Hence , propose conduct randomize control trial 110 hypoalbuminemic ( albumin &lt; 4.0 mg/dL ) MHD patient several DaVita dialysis facility Los Angeles South Bay area . After 1:1 randomization , provide participate subject ( INTERVENTION group ) 8 week high protein meal form prepared meal box ( 50 g protein , 850 Cal , phosphorus protein ratio &lt; 10 mg/gm ) hemodialysis treatment , along 0.5 1.5 g Fosrenol , titrate necessary ; well dietary counsel maintain high dietary protein intake home ( similar binder regimen ) 8 week avoid food item high phosphorus base additive . Meals prepare Harbor-UCLA GCRC Bio-nutrition Department . We review test feasibility meal preparation distribution system related logistics . The CONTROL group also receive meal box meal contains low Calorie ( &lt; 50 Cal ) almost zero protein ( &lt; 1 g ) diet ( salad ) hemodialysis treatment . These patient continue pre-existing phosphorus control regimens . As outcome variable , examine change serum albumin 8 week intervention . We also examine change dietary protein serum phosphorus 2 group 8 week intervention . Quality life patient satisfaction also examine towards end intervention phase . Given ongoing 2-year study similar operation know AIONID Study give DaVita dietician '' collaboration support , anticipate successful recruitment , retention data analysis within 8 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fosrenol Enhancing Dietary Protein Intake Hypoalbuminemic Dialysis Patients ( FrEDI ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Based hypothesis efficacy potency Fosrenol enable increase dietary protein intake provision meal dialysis treatment improve nutritional status malnourish dialysis patient low serum albumin ( &lt; 4.0 g/dL ) serum phosphorus effectively control target range 3.5 5.5 mg/dL . STUDY PROCEDURE : 1 . In subject : Recommend adequate dietary protein intake achieve maintain nPCR ( nPNA ) 1.0 g/kg/day 2 month . Encourage aggressive increase protein intake avoid high phos/protein ratio esp . high intake egg white , meat , fish , poultry , legume , etc . via counsel renal dietician ( RD ) and/or study staff . 2 . Both group receive free meal box first 60 min HD treatment 8 week ( 24 meal 24 HD treatment session ) . Cases receive high protein meal ( ~50 gm , phos/protein ratio &lt; 10 mg//gm ) , whereas control receive salad almost protein . 3 . In CASES ( n=55 ) : Switch binder simultaneously ( start ) Fosrenol 500 mg 1,500 per meal/snack , accord meal size different time day . Recommend crush pill use pill-crusher provided subject , recommend place sprinkle Fosrenol piece food . Titrate dose every 2 week accord serum phosphorus . 4 . In CONTROLLS ( n=55 ) : Continue binder ( Fosrenol ) . In All subject : Titrate binder indicate control serum phosphorus &lt; 5.5 mg/dL . SAFETY ENDPOINTS : 1 . Routine safety measure food ingestion binder administration 2 . Bi-weekly measure mineral monthly measure PTH STATISTICAL METHODS : The test , chi square test , Mann-Whitney rank sum test compare baseline characteristic intervention control participant serum albumin measure . To simplify presentation result , Likert scale response dichotomize . The corresponding P value base complete ordinal scale use participant respond question quality life , satisfaction , food intake often eat meal specific fast-food restaurant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Prevalent hypoalbuminemic hemodialysis patient serum albumin &lt; 4.0 g/dL capable oral food intake 2 .
