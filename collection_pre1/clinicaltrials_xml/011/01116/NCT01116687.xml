	<brief_title>RO4929097 Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective radiographic response rate associate RO4929097 patient metastatic colorectal cancer progress follow least two prior treatment metastatic setting . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) associate agent . II . To determine safety tolerability RO4929097 patient population . III . To assess whether response correlate regulation Notch pathway , determine immunohistochemical analysis Notch1 , ICN HES1 available paraffin-embedded tissue sample ( exploratory aim ) . OUTLINE : Participants take 20 mg RO4929097 mouth home morning 3 day take 4 day , continuously . The tablet take approximately time day take empty stomach , 1 hour meal 2 hour meal . Participants ask keep `` pill diary '' record dose study drug ( include miss , skip , vomited dos ) return diary study staff visit . Participants informed tablet break open ; avoid eating grapefruit drink grapefruit juice study ; miss dose study drug , try make dose ; instead , wait next schedule dose . Participants see study doctor undergo standard blood work ( approximately 12 mL ) every 4 week . During visit , participant ask side effect RO4929097 undergo physical examination . Participants continue take RO4929097 long tolerate long cancer shrinking remain stable .</detailed_description>
