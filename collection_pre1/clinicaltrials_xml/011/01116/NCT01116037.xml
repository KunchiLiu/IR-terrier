	<criteria>Patient &lt; /= 70 year age require isolate aortic valve replacement without concomitant procedure coronary artery bypass another valve reconstruction . ( The three remain valve must native tissue ) . Patient sufficiently ill warrant replacement his/her diseased natural prosthetic valve ( exclude ATS 3f Aortic Bioprosthesis , Model 1000 bioprosthesis ) , base standard cardiovascular diagnostic workups . Patient satisfactory condition , base physical exam Investigator 's experience , average well operative risk , ( i.e. , likely survive three year postoperatively ) . Patient geographically stable willing return implant center followup visit . Patient adequately inform consent his/her participation clinical study , require him/her , order comply protocol . Patient old seventy ( 70 ) year age . Patient noncardiac major progressive disease , Investigator 's experience produce unacceptable increase risk patient , result life expectancy le 3 year . Patient intravenous drug and/or alcohol abuser . Female patient pregnant ( urine HCG test result positive ) , lactate . Patient present active endocarditis . Patient present congenital bicuspid aortic anatomy . This patient present abnormal aortic root geometry . Patient chronic renal failure renal dialysis . Patient previously implant prosthetic valve replace study valve . Patient require mitral , tricuspid pulmonic valve replacement . Patient present dilatation ascend aorta , Marfan Syndrome , EhlersDanlos syndrome , cystic medial degeneration , condition cause ascend aorta irregular geometry physiology see via preoperative imaging . Patient participate concomitant research study investigational product . Patient agree return implant center require number followup visit geographically unavailable followup .</criteria>
