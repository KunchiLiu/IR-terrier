	<brief_title>Does Treating Obstructive Sleep Apnea Obese Canadian Youth Improve Blood Sugar Control ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The five-fold increase prevalence childhood obesity Canada last 15 year lead increase number pediatric case obesity-related obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Not prevalence OSA significantly high among obese child compare general population , group , routine treatment adenotonsillectomy much low cure rate . Instead , Positive Airway Pressure ( PAP ) treatment usually prescribe . Other complication obesity also increasingly recognize child , include metabolic disturbance insulin resistance ( IR ) . This particularly concerning , since IR identify surrogate measure future obesity-related sequela , diabetes , dyslipidemia , cardiovascular disease ( include hypertension , heart rate disturbance ) , inflammation impair quality life . Of particular interest , IR relate obesity exacerbate OSA severity IR correlate severity OSA . IR measure use homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) calculate fast blood glucose insulin level . In obese adult OSA , HOMA-IR , well cardiovascular metabolic marker , show improve follow PAP therapy . Such study do child . We hypothesize PAP treatment obese child moderate-severe OSA improve marker obesity-related disease . Primary Objective : To determine whether , obese child moderate-severe OSA prescribe PAP therapy , increase hour PAP usage per night one-year period associate great improvement HOMA-IR . Secondary Objectives : To determine whether increased hour PAP usage per night associate great improvement follow outcome : 1 ) sympathetic nervous system activation ( systolic diastolic hypertension , nocturnal hypertension , heart rate heart rate variability ) ; 2 ) inflammation 3 ) neurobehavioral quality life measure . Methods : Study design : prospective multi-centre cohort study . Study Population : Obese child ( body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 95th % ile age sex ) 8-17 year old moderate-severe OSA recruit study four pediatric tertiary care centre across Canada . As per current standard care , child moderate-severe OSA , define ≥ 10 obstructive event per hour polysomnography , prescribed PAP treatment . Sample Size : We expect medium effect size ( 0.5 ) ; therefore 10 subject per parameter test ( n=4 ) regression model 25 % attrition require recruitment 54 subject . Measurements make baseline 12 month . Data collection include HOMA-IR , 24-hr blood pressure measurement , electrocardiogram heart rate heart rate variability , C-reactive protein marker inflammation , neurobehavioral/quality life measure ( Conners parent teacher scale , Child Behavior Checklist Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ) physical activity questionnaire ( Habitual Activity Estimation Scale ( HAES ) ) . Data Analysis : Multivariate linear regression analysis perform primary secondary outcome . Our dependent variable change HOMA-IR ; primary independent variable average number hours/night PAP usage . Adjustment variable change BMI % ile , pubertal stage ( Tanner stage 1-2 vs. 3-5 ) , change HAES . Similar analysis perform secondary outcome . Importance : Treatment obesity-related OSA adult show reduce morbidity mortality . Our study uniquely poise timely , first examine impact PAP therapy child measure insulin resistance obesity-related condition . It raise awareness co-morbidities obesity OSA childhood support early intervention , irreversible end-organ damage occur .</detailed_description>
