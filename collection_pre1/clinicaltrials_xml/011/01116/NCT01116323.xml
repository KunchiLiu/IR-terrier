	<brief_summary>Since report `` To Err Human '' Institute Medicine ( IOM ) 1999 , attention bring general public adverse event medicine common one leading cause morbidity mortality within United States . The report estimate 44,000 - 98,000 patient hospitalize United States die year result medical error . In spite grow patient safety movement worldwide , health care become measurably safer . Health care one risk-prone area public demand limit use common-sense safety-enhancing solution , limit flow choose type incoming patient . The latter especially true emergency department ( EDs ) since deliver important public service provide emergency care 24 hour day , 365 day per year , without discrimination social economic status . One key expectation EDs ability provide immediate access stabilization patient emergency medical condition . However , emergency department ( ED ) crowd recognize major , international problem affect patient provider . A recent report IOM note increase strain cause crowd create deficit quality emergency care . Crowding associate reduced access emergency medical service , delay care cardiac patient , increase patient mortality , inadequate pain management , increased cost patient care , delay administration antibiotic therapy . Several issue remain concern ED crowd 's relation adverse event . First , exist evidence adverse event occurrence ED crowd largely anecdotal inconclusive . Secondly , although study show relationship ED crowding mortality , neither examined cause excess mortality . Finally , although significant increase average length hospital stay show ED crowd reason open speculation . The purpose study therefore identify six explicit adverse event mortality patient admit ED compare result relation ED crowding . This provide u novel insight reason hypothesize increase mortality ED crowding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since `` ED crowding '' unplanned condition , randomize control trial possible assess impact adverse patient ' outcome . Therefore , large prospective cohort study , careful match correct risk factor second best design . The ED occupancy rate , define ratio total number ED patient number license treatment bay per hour , use measure ED crowding . The numerator include patient ED point study hour , regardless ED location ( include wait room , boarding , hallway location ) . The denominator , constant per study hour , include total number license treatment bay define accord ED 's original blueprint exclude hallway location . For hour day , ED occupancy rate derive ED information system . 104 week divide 13-week seasonal block nurse shift start 23:00 , 07:00 15:00 . The mean ED occupancy rate calculate shift sum occupancy rate within shift divide 8 . The top quartile mean ED occupancy rate cohort period consider crowd . In order match 'crowded 'and 'not crowd ' cohort , follow data element extract hospital information system register patient : demographic data ( age , sex , co-morbidities ) ; referral source , surgical medical admission ; time arrival ( include season , month year , day week , time day ) ; triage category ; ED total hospital length stay ; final admission diagnosis . Medical record patient present ED review occurrence six adverse event mortality ten day ED stay . The six adverse event search explicit clinical criterion . The reviewer first rate scale 1 6 confidence medical management cause adverse event . If rating 5 6 , indicate injury probably definitely caused management , event consider adverse event . The rating score use assess degree preventability . Hospital mortality search patient present ED point time die hospital stay . In order identify adverse event occurrence hazard ratio 1.2 power 0.9 ED crowding , cohort 104,000 patient need . Therefore , data retrieve 2 year period reviewer blind degree ED crowd relation finding adverse event . The occurrence adverse event mortality compare crowded shift , correct baseline risk factor . A carefully standardize admission form registration relevant information well computerize search tool screen adverse event allow finalize study within foreseen time frame .</detailed_description>
