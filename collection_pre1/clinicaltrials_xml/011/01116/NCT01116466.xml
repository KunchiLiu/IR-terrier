	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Implantation ActiGait Drop Foot Stimulator System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third lead cause death United States develop country major source disability . Prognosis regain ability walk good , 64 % initially dependent walk regain independence 3 month . However , many gait abnormality persist . A conservative estimate suggest 20 % stroke survivor drop foot . Drop foot follow stroke cause paresis ankle dorsiflexor muscle . It prevent patient effectively swing leg walking , cause abnormal gait characterize hip hitch circumduction toe catch . Walking speed people drop foot often significantly reduce risk stumble fall high . The conventional treatment drop foot ankle-foot orthosis ( AFO ) . While AFOs appropriate many patient , certain patient group AFOs significant limitation ( e.g . patient strong spasticity , suffer pronounced inversion , suffer volume change low extremity , etc ) . An alternative way treat drop foot mean functional electrical stimulation . Clinical study evaluate effectiveness drop foot stimulation suggest provide many benefit patient , improve confidence walking , increase walk speed endurance , less effort walking reduce spasticity . Implantable system ActiGait consider therapeutic alternative specifically patient conventional treatment fail . ActiGait system consist external module ( antenna control module ) , foot switch transmit external module implant assembly ( receiver , pulse train generator , electrode ) . The objective study obtain additional evidence safety ActiGait implantation procedure efficacy . The study enrol 5 subject implant follow 12 week . Efficacy outcomes assessed baseline two follow-up visit ( week 6 12 ) . Subjects ask walk without preferred walk baseline without stimulation follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
