	<brief_title>Molecular Phenotypes Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) recessive genetic disorder cause mutation CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . CF multi-organ involvement , respiratory disease major cause morbidity mortality . The median age survival CF 37 year , broad range disease severity lung , even among patient identical CFTR genotype , include deltaF508 homozygote . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This project hold great promise define robust molecular phenotype CF lung disease , relate prognosis , new target therapy . By use large well-defined population deltaF508 homozygote also whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) data , study gene expression across whole transcriptome large number sample two relevant tissue ( respiratory epithelium transform lymphocyte ) , uniquely position develop integrated view molecular mechanism underlie CF lung disease severity .</detailed_description>
