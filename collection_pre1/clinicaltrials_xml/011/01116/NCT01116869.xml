	<brief_summary>The study design confirm current indication ( ) CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) patient use kit China . The CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit intend enumeration circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) epithelial origin ( CD45- , EpCAM+ , cytokeratins 8 , 18+ , and/or 19+ ) whole blood . The presence CTC peripheral blood , detect CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit , associate decreased progression free survival decrease overall survival patient treat metastatic breast cancer . This test use aid monitoring patient metastatic breast cancer . Serial test CTC use conjunction clinical method monitor metastatic breast cancer . Evaluation CTC time course disease allow assessment patient prognosis predictive progression free survival overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A longitudinal , multi-center , prospective study conduct MBC patient evaluate ability CTC predict patient ' prognosis . A separate population healthy benign disease subject serve control compare CTC incidence control group versus MBC group baseline . Correlation CTC radiographic response systemic therapy MBC study group also assess . 300 MBC patient , provide series least 3 blood draw ( baseline , 3-4 week 6-8 week initiation systemic therapy ) CTC analysis , enrol . All MBC patient follow maximum 36 month disease progression survival . 200 healthy benign disease volunteer , donate blood 1 time CTC analysis , enrol control .</detailed_description>
