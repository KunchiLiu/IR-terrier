	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) combination olaparib treatment recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer metastatic triple-negative breast cancer . ( Phase I ) II . Assess efficacy ( measure progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) combination cediranib olaparib compare olaparib alone recurrent grade 2 3 platinum-sensitive papillary-serous endometrioid ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . ( Phase II ) III . Assess MTD cediranib combination olaparib tablet formulation treatment recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . ( Phase I-T ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess toxicities combination cediranib olaparib treatment recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer metastatic triple-negative breast cancer . ( Phase I ) II . Assess clinical benefit , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treat cediranib olaparib . ( Phase I ) III . Assess tumor response , clinical response benefit ( response stable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] response criterion x 16 week ) , overall survival ( OS ) patient treat cediranib olaparib recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) compare patient receive olaparib alone . ( Phase II ) IV . Assess toxicities combination cediranib olaparib ( tablet formulation ) treatment recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , peritoneal cancer . ( Phase I-T ) V. Assess clinical benefit , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treat cediranib olaparib ( tablet formulation ) . ( Phase I-T ) VI . Assess pharmacokinetic profile cediranib olaparib ( tablet formulation ) administer combination . ( Phase I-T ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate prognostic predictive role measure change functional vascular image use dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) -magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) pre-study day 3 . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate exploratory fashion predictive prognostic value single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) key gene involve angiogenesis deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate predictive value baseline peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) poly adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) ribose ( PAR ) incorporation response therapy . ( Phase II ) IV . To measure early change vascular cytokine production evaluate exploratory fashion change may predictive prognostic , differentially affected combination agent . ( Phase II ) V. To evaluate early change circulate endothelial cell change predictive prognostic . ( Phase II ) VI . To assess change measure DNA damage repair angiogenesis tumor cell ( tissue and/or malignant effusion ) correlate drug/drug/combination . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) olaparib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cediranib maleate PO QD olaparib PO BID day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive olaparib PO BID day 1-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
