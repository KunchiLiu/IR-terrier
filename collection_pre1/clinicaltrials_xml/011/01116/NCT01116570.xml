	<brief_summary>It accept physical activity deleterious myopathy , include muscular dystrophy . In patient suffer facioscapulohumeral dystrophy ( FSHD ) , aerobic training report associated physiological functional positive effect without alteration quality life . The review paper Van der Kooi et al . ( 2005 ) , Cup et al . ( 2007 ) Féasson et al . ( 2010 ) suggest combination endurance strength train even relevant . Only control randomized study conduct topic . The impact training program skeletal muscle regenerative capacity yet address . Moreover , due fact train program mainly perform short-term supervised period , lack knowledge regard long-term effect , patient 's autonomy whether regular exercise practice maintain patient 's daily life . Also , experiment report integrative view potential benefit program functional , biological quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our research project aim establish program physical training fulfill two follow condition : ( ) compatible daily professional , social family activity patient integrated life habit ( ii ) intensive enough induce functional benefit . This experimental work base multi-factorial evaluation , i.e . biological , physiological , functional , quality life questionnaire . This work base collaboration Universities Saint Etienne ( L. Féasson ) , Grenoble ( B Wuyam ) Örebro ( F Kadi ) within Rhône-Alpes Reference Centre Rare Neuromuscular Diseases ( JC Antoine ) . It accept exercise therapy recommend patient myopathy long-term training load still determine pathology . In specific context facioscapulohumeral dystrophy , aim associate scientific evaluation physical activity benefit therapeutic education patient order contribute recommendation physician physiotherapist . The purpose study combine integrate approach well understanding biological process implicate physiological treatment strategy .</detailed_description>
