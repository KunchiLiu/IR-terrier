	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate Efficacy FITOGYN Versus Placebo Vasomotor Symptomatology Associated With Menopause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One significant problem assess treatment hot flush placebo effect . A Phase IV study innovative design , intend additionally assess effect , report . The efficacy Fitogyn treatment hot flush menopausal woman moderate symptom assess . Secondary objective include evaluation impact Fitogyn compare placebo overall menopause symptom ( fatigue , joint pain , vaginal dryness , sleep disturbance ) , anxiety , quality life , cardiovascular parameter . Equol level blood also measure study potential impact outcome treatment isoflavones . The duration study participant 22 week . 7 visit plan study : After screen visit ( visit 1 ) , woman select report daily occurrence hot flush 2 week without treatment . If experience require number hot flush ( 35-70 hot flush prior week 9 least moderate intensity ) , 4-week placebo run-in period start ( visit 2 ) . After time ( Visit 3 ) , woman decrease low 25 % number hot flush treatment adherence least 80 % randomised receive treatment ( Fitogyn v placebo ) 16 week . During visit 3 , baseline assessment primary secondary variable carry . Additionally , blood urine sample obtain conduct hematological biochemical test , assess thyroid function lipid profile . In addition , patient complete follow scale : `` Menopausal Rating Scale ( MRS ) '' , scale anxiety ( HADS ) quality life ( Scale Cervantes ) . Visits 4 , 5 6 : To assess every 4 week treatment adherence , safety evaluation daily collection hot flash . Visit 7 : End study ( week 22 study ) . During visit activity describe visit 3 perform . SUBSTUDY : TITLE : `` Evaluating impact combination soy isoflavones red clover extract ( FITOGYN ) compare placebo marker atherogenesis '' The substudy conduct subsample approximately 90 patient involve Investigational Sites willing conduct substudy , give mean proper correct handle sample . This study exploratory purpose , provide useful insight specific mechanisms action phytoestrogens well generate new hypothesis guide future research product . Additionally , blood equol level measure study potential effect treatment outcome isoflavones . A number biological parameter identify clearly related process atherogenesis . This measurement would blood collection perform baseline end trial , new blood collection necessary beyond already plan . The selected parameter : 1 . Level insulin resistance HOMA . 2 . Low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) , oxidize ( ox LDL ) concentration . 3 . Asymmetric dimethyl arginine concentration endothelial cell culture 4 . Measure ratio prostacyclin / thromboxane urine . 5 . Genesis tissue factor endothelium . 6 . Measurement blood level equol .</detailed_description>
