	<brief_summary>The study objective evaluate safety efficacy oral administration lenalidomide combination dexamethasone treatment adult patient refractory relapsed non-Ph+ B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeat-dose Study Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ® ) Plus Dexamethasone Patients With Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist two period , initial treatment period extend treatment period . Patients meet eligibility criterion receive : Lenalidomide 25 mg p.o . daily day 1-21 plus Dexamethasone 40 mg p.o . daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle ( 4-weeks cycle ) CR achievement , progression disease intolerable toxicity . The daily dose Lenalidomide Dexamethasone remain fixed . No dose adaptation allow accord hematologic toxicity . However , case non-hematologic grade &gt; 2 toxicity , next cycle may delay 21 day onset event adverse event return baseline ≤ grade 1 . Patients may allow receive pre-treatment high dos dexamethasone initial hyperleukocytosis discretion investigator . The use hematopoietic growth factor ( HGF ) initial extended treatment period also let discretion investigator . At end initial treatment period , respond patient ( without HLA compatible donor ) patient show sufficient clinical activity allow receive extend treatment cycle identical first cycle . Patients may continue receive treatment long patient tolerating treatment well patient 's physician believe patient receive benefit . The severity adverse event grade accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion . Any life-threatening adverse effect observe initial extended treatment period , possibly probably related study drug , require subject discontinue study treatment .</detailed_description>
