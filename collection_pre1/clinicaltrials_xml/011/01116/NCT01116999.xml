	<brief_title>Retrograde Light Target Tracheal Intubation Technique : Clinical Comparison With Direct Pharyngoscopic Tracheal Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experiment conduct close supervision coaching anesthesiologists several stage . The training stage : First , operator receive train respect theory principles airway management , include technique bag-mask ventilation , Direct laryngoscopy tracheal intubation light-guided tracheal intubation good master theoretical background , technical risk indication two technique . Then , receive manikin training two technique Airway Management Trainer . Exposure glottis ( EG ) /tracheal intubation ( TI ) training would continue able use technique complete three consecutive case Exposure glottis/tracheal intubation operation successfully manikin trainer within 120 second ( ) time . 20 medical worker assign perform TI within 120 either Direct laryngoscopy TI light-guided TI technique , select randomly convert alternative one complete 5 case two technique . The time EG start mouth open patient exposure glottis . The time TI also start mouth open patient completion insert tracheal guide tracheal seal cuff inflation . The EG time , Cormack-Lehane ( C &amp; L ) grade , TI time , one-time success rate , overall success rate use two TI technique record . The patient lay supine position , head lay 7cm-high pillow sake stability . The peripheral vein access routinely connect standard monitor electrocardiography ( ECG ) , SpO2 noninvasive blood pressure ( BP ) . Sufficient oxygen inhalation initiate &gt; 3min induction general anesthesia midazolam , propofol , fentanyl rocuronium bromide . The anesthesiologist allow give instruction suggestion assistance operator whole process . The coach anesthesiologist supervise whole TI process closely . Should hide risk occur TI exceed require time experiment , TI attempt operator would terminate replaced anesthesiologist order ensure patient ' safety : TI exceed 120 ; Attempt TI exceed 2 time ; SpO2 decrease 95 % ; appearance unstable hemodynamic situation ( mean BP HR fluctuate 25 % baseline value ) ; occurrence airway injury evidence stain blood Macintosh Blade . Any patient C &amp; L grade III~IV discover anesthesiologist TI would exclude present study replace anther patient re-start experiment . A 7.0- 7.5-mm-ID endotracheal tube use guide accord patient 's condition .</detailed_description>
