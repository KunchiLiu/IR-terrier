	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether bevacizumab give together pemetrexed disodium cisplatin effective erlotinib hydrochloride give together bevacizumab treat patient non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study give bevacizumab together pemetrexed disodium cisplatin see well work compare give erlotinib hydrochloride together bevacizumab treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To demonstrate tailored therapy , accord tumor histology EGFR-mutation status , introduction novel drug combination frontline treatment patient stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer , promise investigation . Secondary - To prospectively explore molecular marker clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) -mutation status ( mutate vs wildtype ) . Patients assign 1 2 group . - mutEGFR ( mutate epidermal growth factor receptor ) group : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - wtEGFR ( wildtype epidermal growth factor receptor ) group cohort 1 : - Induction chemotherapy : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute , cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Maintenance therapy : Patients without progressive disease receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression . Blood tissue specimen collect EGFR molecular marker analysis , include gene expression , mutation , pharmacogenomic analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . - wtEGFR ( wildtype epidermal growth factor receptor ) group cohort 2 : - Induction chemotherapy : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute , cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Maintenance therapy : Patients without progressive disease receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression . Blood tissue specimen collect EGFR molecular marker analysis , include gene expression , mutation , pharmacogenomic analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 129 evaluable patient ( 77 cohort 1 52 cohort 2 ) wtEGFR status 20 patient mutEGFR status accrue study .</detailed_description>
