	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine laparoscopic plication gastrojejunostomy effective surgical option Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patient regain weight due dilate gastric stoma . There several reason postulate cause patient regain weight gastric bypass , include poor diet choice , dilation gastric pouch enlargement gastric stoma . We aim demonstrate laparoscopic plication enlarge gastrojejunostomy provide safe effective method promote increase weight loss subset gastric bypass patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Excess body weight show many adverse health effect include , increase risk diabetes , hypertension , joint problem early death . Roux-en-Y gastric bypass show literature effective weight loss surgery majority patient morbidly obese short long term weight loss management . However , 80 % patient undergo gastric bypass lose 67-75 % excess body weight within 2 year surgery , 20 % patient fail loose regain substantial portion excess body weight.1-2 There several reason postulate cause patient regain weight gastric bypass surgery . These include poor nutritional choice eat high caloric carbohydrate graze eat pattern . Also dilation gastric pouch overtime decrease feel satiety allow large meal eat cause recidivism obesity . Another problem occur enlargement gastrojejunostomy anastomosis . Patients open large 2 cm rapid empty food intestine decrease satiety meal . Plication standard surgical technique fold tucking , use widely part human anatomy . There several method try past place plication suture gastrojejunostomy endoluminal approach.3-7 These device success widely used time . We aim demonstrate laparoscopic suture plication enlarge gastrojejunostomy provide safe effective minimally invasive method promote increase weight loss subset gastric bypass patient enlarge gastric stoma . Specific Aim 1 To demonstrate laparoscopic plication enlarge gastric bypass safe surgical option promote weight loss Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patient . Specific Aim 2 To monitor effectiveness long term weight loss laparoscopic plication gastrojejunostomy Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patient</detailed_description>
