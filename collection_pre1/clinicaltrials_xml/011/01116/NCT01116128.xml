	<brief_summary>Clinically demonstrate efficacy Melphalan Prednisone MM subject well confirm inhibitory effect dasatinib several tyrosine kinase receptor pathways implicate pathophysiology MM . Additionally , SRC inhibitor , dasatinib play important role bone metabolism inhibition osteoclast-mediated bone resorption vitro . Dasatinib could , thus , beneficial bone density patient study , blockage osteolysis control bone lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib Combination With Melphalan Prednisone Treat Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To determine whether combination dasatinib melphalan prednisone provide therapeutic benefit safe patient relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma . Study design , dose mode administration , duration treatment : Multicenter , open-label , single arm , two-stage , Phase II study dasatinib combination melphalan prednisone ( D-MP ) advance , refractory MM patient . The three drug concurrently administer 6 cycle ; cycle 28 day long ( 1 cycle = 4 week ) , total 24 week treatment . The treatment schedule follow : - Melphalan 0,18 mg/Kg/day day 1 day 4 6 cycle ; - Prednisone 1,5 mg/Kg/day day 1 day 4 6 cycle ; - Dasatinib 100 mg QD continuously ( day 1 day 28 ) . After 6 cycle D-MP treatment , Dasatinib continuously administer alone maintenance , occurrence progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity inform consent withdrawal . This two-stage Phase II trial accord Simon bivariate endpoint design , treatment efficacy safety jointly evaluate . This design allow trial early stop first stage number observe partial response ( PR ) inadequate number observe toxicity high . In first stage protocol 17 patient require .</detailed_description>
