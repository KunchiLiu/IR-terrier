	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving vorinostat together lenalidomide may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together lenalidomide treat patient relapsed refractory Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination lenalidomide vorinostat . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend dose vorinostat lenalidomide give combination patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain preliminary data response rate , time response , response duration time progression ( TTP ) vorinostat lenalidomide use combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive oral vorinostat twice daily day 1-14 oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
