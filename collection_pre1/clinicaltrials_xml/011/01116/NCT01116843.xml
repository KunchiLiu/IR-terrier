	<brief_title>Study Assess Biomarkers Patients With Resectable Oral Cavity Cancer Randomized Receive Preoperative Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , double-blinded , biomarker driven , preoperative window opportunity study pharmacodynamic primary endpoint . Patients resectable , histologically confirm OCC surgical treatment plan definitive management , randomize 2:1 receive PF-00299804 pre-operatively dose 45 mg daily orally 7-11 day Matching Placebo 7-11 day depend surgery schedule . The target total 8 day treatment minimum 7 maximum 11 dosing day . All patient receive surgery per standard care without delay . Biomarkers surgical specimen baseline tumor biopsy consent provide tumor block exist primary diagnostic tumor biopsy complete within 90 day evaluate primary secondary pharmacodynamic endpoint .</detailed_description>

Patients distant metastatic disease diagnosis SCCHN may enrol Must able provide fresh tumor biopsy prior randomization histopathological biomarker evaluation . No antineoplastic treatment allow obtain baseline tumor specimen randomization . Patients decline inhouse fresh pretreatment tumor biopsy must give consent provide tumor block exist diagnostic primary tumor biopsy complete within 90 day enrolment Prior treatment agent target epidermal growth factor receptor allow . No prior chemotherapy radiotherapy ( primary site/nodes ) . Patient must receive prior antineoplastic treatment within past 2 year Any treatmentrelated acute toxicity , include laboratory abnormality , must recover CTCAE Grade 1 ( v.4.0 ) baseline , except toxicity consider safety risk .
