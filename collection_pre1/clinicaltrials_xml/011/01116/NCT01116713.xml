	<brief_title>Effect Dexamethasone Postoperative Symptoms After Mastectomy Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer frequent malignant neoplasm worldwide . In emerge country Mexico , increase frequency mortality [ 1 , 2 ] second frequent neoplasm cervical carcinoma . Between 25,000 30,000 new case diagnose annually . Unfortunately , woman regular mammography screen proportion patient locally advanced disease diagnosis high . In 2003 , 5-10 % newly diagnose case Mexico clinical stage 0 I [ 2 ] . Surgical resection axillary lymph node dissection constitutes treatment choice associate neoadjuvant therapy postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . Postoperative pain , nausea vomiting ( PONV ) common complication anesthesia surgery . Women undergo mastectomy axillary dissection particularly high risk development PONV incidence 60-80 % patient receive antiemetic report . Emetic episode predispose aspiration gastric content , wound dehiscence , psychological distress , delayed recovery discharge time . These justify use prophylactic antiemetic woman schedule mastectomy . Most currently use antiemetic , include antihistamine , butyrophenones dopamine receptor antagonist report cause occasional undesirable adverse effect , excessive sedation , hypotension , dry mouth , dysphoria , hallucination extrapyramidal sign . Antiserotonins ( e.g. , ondansetron ) available prevention treatment PONV patient undergo various type surgery . However , use prophylactic antiemetic therapy antiserotonins criticize expensive . Dexamethasone first report effective antiemetic regimen patient receive cancer chemotherapy . Some author review available randomized trial ( 1996-2001 ) regard perioperative single-dose steroid administration find dexamethasone antiemetic analgesic effect various type operation . One ot study demostrated intravenous dexamethasone 4 mg effective prevention PONV follow breast surgery could demonstrate difference postoperative pain . The purpose study evaluate efficacy dexamethasone treatment reduce pain PONV well analgesic antiemetic requirement woman undergo general anesthesia mastectomy axillary node dissection . Patients Methods Patients Between June August 2009 , 70 patient undergoing mastectomy axillary dissection study prospective , randomize , double-blind clinical trial . Patients randomize receive intravenous dexamethasone ( 8 mg ) homologated placebo 60 minute skin incision , use equal number blind envelope . Patients American Society Anesthesiologists class III IV exclude . Further exclusion criterion age 80 year ; pregnancy ; active menstruation ; treatment steroid ; severe diabetes mellitus ( serum HbA1c &gt; 8 % ) ; use opioids , sedative kind analgesic less one week mastectomy , history alcohol drug abuse . Patients history motion sickness ⁄or previous PONV surgical procedure exclude . All patient admit hospital one day operation follow hospital admission 30 day surgical procedure detect medical surgical morbidity . Anesthesia surgery All patient underwent standardized general anesthesia procedure none receive preanesthetic medication . Induction use intravenous propofol ( 2 mg/kg body weight ) fentanyl ( 3-5 mcg/kg ) . Vecuronium bromide ( 0.1 mg/kg ) use facilitate tracheal intubation . Anesthesia maintain 2-3 % sevoflurane 66 % nitrous oxide oxygen . Ventilation control mechanically maintain constant throughout surgery use anesthetic respiratory gas analyzer monitoring . All patient monitor indirect determination arterial pressure heart rate use standard technique , well expire CO2 content oxygen blood saturation . Afterwards , patient extubated transferred immediate postsurgical care unit cardiovascular oxygen monitoring . Surgical procedure All patient treat accord preoperative clinical stage radical mastectomy breast conservative surgery lymph node axillary dissection surgical team . In patient , close suction drain place region subject surgery remove following day . Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy administer 3-4 week uncomplicated surgical resection . Analgesia antiemetic therapy Pain assessed immediately return recovery room 6 , 12 24 h operation use visual analogue scale ( VAS ; 0 = pain 10 = severe pain ) . Analgesia give intravenous sodium ketorolac ( 30 mg every 8 hour ) intravenous tramadol infusion ( 50 mg ) use backup analgesic medication . The incidence PONV record immediately return recovery room 6 , 12 24 h operation , use three point ordinal scale ( 0 = none , 1 = nausea , 2 = retching , 3 = vomit ) . Nausea define subjectively unpleasant sensation associate awareness urge vomit , retch define labored , spasmodic , rhythmic contraction respiratory muscle without expulsion gastric content , vomit define forceful expulsion gastric content mouth . Intravenous ondansetron ( 4-8 mg ) give antiemetic treatment demand . Data collection statistical analysis Postoperative complication record hospitalization patient follow 30 day discharge . Additional data collect included patient age , body mass index ( BMI ) , history smoking neoadjuvant chemotherapy , anesthesia operation time frequency use analgesic antiemetic drug . These parameter sum compare dexamethasone placebo groups.The study endpoint postoperative nausea vomiting , pain measure VAS need additional analgesic antiemetic drug . The sample size predetermine . We expect 35 % difference incidence nausea vomit group . The alpha error set 0.05 beta error 0.20 ; n = 35 patient group consider adequate , accord power analysis . Results express percentage mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Student 's test , Chi-squared test Fisher 's Exact Test use analysis quantitative qualitative data , respectively . Differences consider statistically significant p &lt; 0.05 . Ethical consideration The study conduct accord principle Declaration Helsinki 1989 Mexican Health Guidelines . The Ethical Research Committees Oncologic Institute , approve protocol . Full , write informed consent obtain patient inclusion study .</detailed_description>
