	<brief_summary>The purpose study test preventive effect combination drug : polyphenon E ( PPE ) derive green tea extract , erlotinib . Because combination drug test human prevention cancer , clear dose agent optimal combination . We test safety combination PPE erlotinib see effect ( good and/or bad ) patient 's premalignant lesion , find high dose agent give combination without cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>

For patient T1N0 T2N0 treat squamous cell carcinoma , must free disease minimum period 8 week , maximum 3 year follow completion surgery and/or radiotherapy . Eligible tumor premalignant lesion site include oral cavity ( buccal mucosal , gingival , floor mouth , dorsal/ventral tongue , pharyngeal wall ) , oropharynx , larynx ( glottis , supraglottis , subglottis , epiglottis ) , hypopharynx paranasal sinus nasal cavity . Patients treat tumor 1node 0 ( T1N0 ) tumor 2node 0 ( T2N0 ) squamous cell carcinoma may oral premalignant lesion ( i.e. , hyperplasia , dysplasia , carcinoma situ ) time study entry ( provided Stage I II disease definitively treat ) . Lesion sit include oral cavity ( buccal mucosa , gingival , floor mouth , dorsal/ventral tongue , pharyngeal wall ) , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx ( glottis , supraglottis , subglottis , epiglottis ) , nasopharynx paranasal sinus . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) /Zubrod performance status 01 . No medical contraindication flexible laryngoscopy use topical anesthesia , set contraindication topical anesthesia , general anesthesia may use substitute . General anesthesia , indicate , acceptable patient whose lesion would require general anesthesia laryngoscopy biopsy accord routine standard care . Blood count : total neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm³ ; platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm³ . Adequate liver function : Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dl Alkaline phosphatase , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 time ULN Adequate renal function : serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl . Hemoglobin level ≥ 11gm/dl ( age adjust appropriate ) provide reference laboratory perform test . Patients take warfarin must prothrombin time ( PT ) /partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) level ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal provide reference laboratory perform test . Adequate pulmonary function : forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) least 60 % predict value spirometry . Signed write informed consent . The effect polyphenon E develop human fetus recommend dose unknown . For reason polyphenon E may teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform study physician immediately . Women childbearing potential must also negative urine pregnancy test ( βHCG ) within 72 hour receive treatment . Must able swallow oral dos erlotinib PPE . Must willing abstain drinking green tea take supplement contain green tea green tea compound , duration investigation 30 day prior study entry . Please note patient treat T1N0 T2N0 squamous carcinoma premalignant measurable lesion time study entry subject biopsy cytobrush sample take specified protocol . Exclusion Criteria Because dose adverse event data currently available use Polyphenon E participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Participants hyperplasia , absence dysplasia carcinoma situ , exclude possibly benefit . Participants acute intercurrent illness surgery within precede 4 week unless fully recover . History previous malignancy unless cancer stage I II render free disease 1 year . Participants pregnant breast feeding . Pregnant woman exclude study Polyphenon E investigational agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother Polyphenon E , breastfeed discontinue mother treated Polyphenon E. Not practice adequate contraception participant child bear potential . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , severe active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within past six month , unstable angina pectoris , serious cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement exclude .

Consumption green tea supplement contain green tea tea extract within 30 day prior enrollment . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition polyphenon E , tea , inactive ingredient present active placebo drug product , include gelatin capsule . Any condition would make subject , opinion investigator , unsuitable study .</criteria>
