	<detailed_description>While pulmonary hypertension frequently present COPD , particularly presence hypoxemia , generally limited mild increase mean pulmonary artery pressure face normal cardiac output . Apart classical widely observe profile PH modestly elevate mPAP , COPD patient characterize high level mPAP rest , fulfil definition moderate severe PH . This kind PH may observe patient present severe obstructive disease , sometimes contrast mild moderate obstruction . In latter case , term disproportionate PH propose , extend describe COPD patient moderate to- severe PH . Therefore , possible patient COPD , pulmonary hypertension contribute clinical picture right ventricular output limitation responsible poor prognosis patient , similar primary pulmonary arterial hypertension . The exact incidence clinically significant pulmonary hypertension , define pulmonary hypertension contributes symptomatology prognosis , difficult estimate COPD . A prevalence 5.8 % - 13.5 % patient seem reasonable would suggest incidence 1-3/10,000 , 100 time incidence idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension . These patient characterize marked effort dyspnea , profound hypoxemia , hypocapnia , moderate airway obstruction low DLCO . PH COPD independent prognostic factor . Indeed , patient similar airflow limitation lower life expectancy PH resent . Patients PH significantly low survival rate 5 yr compare patient without PH ( 33 versus 66 % ) . Pathologic study stem long-term oxygen trial point fact pulmonary vascular remodel chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) medial hypertrophy long-lasting hypoxic vasoconstriction . In patient , vessel wall layer appear involve , intimal change actually prominent . Major remodel pulmonary arterial vessel layer explain pulmonary hypertension COPD often , minimally , reversible supplemental oxygen , acutely chronically . The pathobiology pulmonary artery remodel advanced COPD remain incompletely explore . There data support endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor-dilator imbalance , mainly decrease endothelial nitric oxide expression . Plasma level ET-1 increase patient severe COPD evidence ETA ETB receptor expression increase pulmonary artery patient COPD . The major unmet medical need absence simple drug therapy relieve breathlessness muscle fatigue , reduces pulmonary vascular resistance overload right ventricle severely limit exercise tolerance COPD affect survival . The validated therapeutic approach 'common ' PH COPD patient long-term oxygen therapy . A large variety vasodilator test numerous study short- medium-term administration . The early enthusiasm vanish subsequently several reason : modesty vasodilator effect , inability drug sustain acute benefit , specificity vasodilator effect concomitant systemic vasodilatation , deleterious effect gas exchange due diminution ventilation/perfusion ratio demonstration survival benefit . At present time vasodilator recommend management COPD . Treatments PAH show dramatic change past year . Synthetic prostacyclin ( epoprostenol ) , prostacyclin analogue , endothelin-1 receptor antagonists phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor use group I PAH improve clinical outcome . Based analogy primary pulmonary hypertension , specific intervention aim restoration endothelial vasoconstrictor- dilator imbalance could undertake . Selective pulmonary vasodilatation inhalation vasorelaxant agent appeal concept circumvent hazard inherent systemic vasodilator therapy COPD patient PH . Treatment patient aerosolization iloprost may reduce pulmonary vascular resistance , increase cardiac output conserve ventilation-perfusion match shunt prevent worsen arterial hypoxia waste small ventilatory reserve patient . In order resolve uncertainty suggest evaluate effectiveness inhale iloprost COPD patient moderate severe pulmonary hypertension . This evaluation would include monitoring measurement relevant cardio-respiratory variable set detail .</detailed_description>
