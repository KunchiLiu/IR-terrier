	<detailed_description>Many study past decade demonstrate clinical outcome improve critically ill adult aggressive management hyperglycemic insulin infusion ( Van Den Berghe 2001 , Van Den Berghe 2006 , Krinsey 2004 , Treggari 2008 , Scalea , 2007 , Lang 2007 ) . Yet , study recent trial ( i.e . Glucontrol ( Preiser , 2009 ) VISEP ( Brunkhorst , 2008 ) ( NICE-SUGAR , 2009 ) ) , highlight potential real risk glycemic control ( namely iatrogenic hypoglycemia ) question effectively glucose control critical illness . One reason suboptimal glycemic control witness trial may rigorously refine validate . Even , many medical oversight committee ( include Institutes Healthcare Improvement , American Diabetes Association , Society Critical Care Medicine , among others ) continue recommend regular aggressive glycemic control critically ill patient . Although specifically include excluded recommendation , pediatric intensivists incorporate glycemic control regular practice primarily due concern therapy induce hyperglycemia - although report protocol appear effective control BG level low rate hypoglycemia ( Preissig et al 2008 , Verhoeven et al 2009 ) . Our group Emory University Children 's ' Healthcare Atlanta take progressive , yet methodical , approach good understand implication hyperglycemia treatment critically ill injured child . Practitioners facility develop pediatric-specific protocol identify treat hyperglycemia critically ill child . We institute approach standard care facility experience manage several hundred child hyperglycemia . Our approach glycemic management promise safety efficacy profile , even compare stringent successful glycemic control protocol use adult . We publish first experience pediatric glycemic control pediatric 2008 ( Preissig et al PCCM 2008 ) use experience identify specific risk factor develop hypoglycemia ( Preissig et al JPed , 2009 ) . The goal proposal assist step-wise approach investigate hyperglycemia critically ill child externally validate glycemic control protocol via multi-center evaluation . In , also develop infrastructure test intervention leveraged future study hyperglycemia pediatric critical illness , include multi-center outcome trial . The specific hypothesis project protocol safe efficient identify manage hyperglycemia critically ill injured child pediatric ICUs regardless ICU size , acuity , model , staff makeup , clinical focus .</detailed_description>
