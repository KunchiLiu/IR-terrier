	<brief_summary>Purpose : Phase 1 : ( Pilot Phase ) To compare treatment efficacy surgical clipping endovascular coiling unruptured intracranial aneurysm . To obtain good estimate morbidity mortality relate surgical endovascular treatment strategy one year within context RCT . To show RCT compare morbidity mortality surgical management strategy endovascular management strategy feasible . Phase 2 : To compare result surgical endovascular management strategy , term : 1 . Overall mortality morbidity 1 5 year . 2 . The clinical efficacy safety surgical endovascular management strategy 1 5 year Hypotheses : Phase 1 Hypotheses : 1 . Surgical clip intradural , saccular , unruptured intracranial aneurysm superior endovascular management term lesser number patient experience treatment failure . 2 . An RCT compare clinical outcome surgical versus endovascular management strategy feasible . Phase 1 Primary End-points : â€¢ Treatment failure , hereby define occur either : intend initial modality ( surgical endovascular ) fail occlude aneurysm , `` major '' ( saccular ) angiographic aneurysm recurrence find , intracranial hemorrhagic event occur 1-year follow-up period . Phase 1 Secondary End-points : 1 . Overall morbidity mortality one year . 2 . Occurrence morbidity ( mRS &gt; 2 ) mortality follow treatment . 3 . Occurrence failure aneurysm occlusion use initial intend treatment modality . 4 . Occurrence `` major '' ( saccular ) angiographic aneurysm recurrence . 5 . Occurrence intracranial hemorrhage follow treatment . 6 . Peri-treatment hospitalization last 5 day 7 . Discharge follow treatment location home Treatment : Trial feasibility , capacity patient recruitment , would require enrollment least 8 patient per actively recruit center per year . Phase 2 Hypotheses : It may early explicitly define primary hypothesis Phase 2 , however , intent Phase 2 express : 1 . One management strategy superior term clinical outcome five year . 2 . One management strategy superior term clinical efficacy five year .</brief_summary>
