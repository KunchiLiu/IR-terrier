	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn effective way motivate people increase non-exercise energy expenditure exercise . This important research question obesity weight-related issue increasingly become problem America . This project address research question test effect group dynamic motivate employee predominantly sedentary use Walkstations work . The Walkstations treadmill move slow rate ( maximum 2miles / hour ) attach work station ( i.e . computer telephone ) ; therefore design increase energy spend heavy exercise , small change posture movement associate routine daily life ( call nonexercise activity thermogenesis NEAT ) . The propose study design build upon previous research ( Levine et al. , 2005 ) suggest role NEAT-enhanced behavior weight loss . In study , investigator interested impact group dynamic propensity use Walkstations . Participants active arm ask use Walkstations least 3 hour per week . They sign time slot . During session , ask log schedule system indicate use Walkstation . Walkstation usage assess log-in data : employee log-in phone computer use Walkstation . This log-in data work-station specific ; therefore investigator able tell give subject use Walkstation . Subjects randomly assign one three condition : 1 . Individual . In individual condition , participant part team . They receive weekly email feedback Walkstation performance ( e.g . number time slot sign , number time show time slot . ) Participants also receive wellness tip email . ( see appendix sample email ) 2 . Pairs . In pair condition , participant randomly assign partner . They receive feedback individual condition , AND partner . 3 . Group . In group condition , participant randomly assign group 5 people . They receive feedback individual condition , AND member group .</brief_summary>
