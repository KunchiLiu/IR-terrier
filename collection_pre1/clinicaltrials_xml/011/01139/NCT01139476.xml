	<brief_summary>Background : - Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , type cancer affect white blood cell , often precede precancerous disorder know monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance ( MGUS ) . Farmers agricultural worker higher risk develop MGUS MM , possibly exposure certain pesticide . Researchers interested study biological specimen take participant Agricultural Health Study specifically , pesticide applicator least 50 year age cancer well understand development MGUS MM . Objectives : - To collect biological specimen Agricultural Health Study participant research . - To examine relationship pesticide exposure MGUS/MM . Eligibility : - Male pesticide applicator 50 year age , cancer-free , participate Agricultural Health Study . Design : - Two group participant complete study : general group small group individual expose pesticide diazinon . - All participant receive initial contact letter information study , follow phone call administer screen questionnaire arrange home visit researcher within next month . - Participants receive mail urine specimen kit collect home visit . - During home visit , study researcher take blood sample collect urine sample , administer another questionnaire . - Participants group expose diazinon three home visit study : ( 1 ) prior pesticide exposure , ( 2 ) day participant stop use diazinon , ( 3 ) 21 day second visit . The first visit take place off-season January March ; second third visit conduct April August . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Specimen Collection Agricultural Health Study Cohort Pesticide Exposure Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct molecular epidemiology study subset participant Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) , prospective cohort 57,310 license pesticide applicator Iowa North Carolina . Blood urine sample collect 2,200 cancer-free male AHS participant age 50 . These participant also ask complete brief interview ( approximately 20 minute ) regard recent exposure lifestyle health characteristic , conduct time biospecimen collection . Participants Iowa North Carolina enrol home visit interview sample collection take place throughout year 2010-2014 . The propose study two primary objective . First , determine prevalence study etiology monoclonal gammopathy undetermined significance ( MGUS ) , precursor biomarker multiple myeloma . We compare prevalence MGUS AHS cohort prevalence two general population-based cohort ( i.e. , Olmsted County NHANES IID ) well-characterized MGUS prevalence level . As result previous data collection effort AHS , comprehensive information lifetime occupational exposure lifestyle factor available subject include study . We examine association MGUS lifetime exposure specific pesticide within AHS cohort . We also evaluate several biomarkers , include telomere length global DNA hypomethylation peripheral blood lymphocyte , association specific pesticide excess risk MGUS . The second objective establish resource remain blood urine sample collect participant study . These biospecimens use evaluate biological plausibility mechanism-of-action association pesticides cancer observe earlier AHS study . Many pesticide non-genotoxic mechanism carcinogenesis determine . One future study involve repository sample investigation monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis ( MBL ) , marker show precede chronic lymphocytic leukemia previous study . Several pesticide current widespread use AHS link leukemia . We determine prevalence MBL AHS cohort evaluate potential association specific pesticide interest well explain relation pesticide exposures leukemia risk .</detailed_description>
