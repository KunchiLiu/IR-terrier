	<brief_title>Manipulation Visceral Hypersensitivity With Probiotic Bacteria Irritable Bowel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background An incomplete understanding mechanism underlie irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) hamper development effective therapy condition . This long overdue condition affect least 20 percent population ( 1 ) , major impact patient 's quality life ( QOL ) ( 2 ) .Current understand underlying aetiology pathogenesis IBS center two level : brain-gut axis provide concept stress , emotion psychological condition alter perception IBS symptom . Within intestinal wall , patho-physiological mechanism implicate IBS include infection , immune activation , dysmotility , abnormal fermentation visceral hypersensitivity . Studies show visceral pain threshold response stress low patient IBS compare healthy volunteer ( 3 ) . This hypersensitivity apparent response physical chemical stimulus trigger visceral hypersensitivity remain largely unknown . intestinal bacteria play significant role induce IBS . For instance post-infectious IBS develop subgroup patient follow bout gastroenteritis ( 4 ) . Manipulation commensal microbiota alleviate IBS symptom evidence probiotic preparation contain certain Bifidobacteria may particularly effective ( 5 ) . This proposal focus exploration mechanism underlie visceral hypersensitivity direct future target therapy probiotic preparation . Aims The aim study ( ) identify IBS-associated change intestinal microbiota ; ( ii ) study SERT expression genotyping , relationship gut microbiota , ( iii ) determine whether probiotic therapy alters visceral sensitivity IBS patient whether probiotic-induced change visceral hypersensitivity associate change intestinal microbiota . Hypothesis The investigator postulate bacteria modulate sensory afferent signal serotonin signalling , necessary visceral sensation pathway target therapy IBS use probiotic bacteria . RESEARCH PLAN This study consist two part . The first part cross-sectional study compare colonic microbiota SERT expression IBS patient healthy control . The second part involve pilot open-label study assess effect oral probiotic bacteria visceral hypersensitivity , SERT expression mucosal microbiota patient IBS . Baseline visit Ten subject IBS recruit outpatient clinic . Disease severity determine enrolment validate IBS symptom questionnaire . Routine blood test include full blood count , biochemistry profile C-reactive protein obtain . Rectal sensitivity pressure pain assess Barostat device . Barostat device use many study measure visceral hypersensitivity . Equipment test currently use laboratory . A baseline colonoscopy perform rectal biopsy take . Ten control undergo screen colonoscopy polyp colorectal cancer subsequently find normal colonoscopy include participate FGI-Bx study , tissue sample would use study . Baseline sample IBS : 1 rectal tissue ( formalin fix histology ) 2 rectal tissue ( SERT polymorphism ) 3 rectal tissue ( mucosal microbiota ) 5ml blood EDTA tube ( SERT polymorphism ) Samples control : 1 rectal tissue ( formalin fix histology ) 2 rectal tissue ( SERT polymorphism ) 3 rectal tissue ( mucosal microbiota ) 5ml blood EDTA tube ( SERT polymorphism ) Intervention IBS Patients receive VSL # 3 ( 450 billion lyophilize bacteria/sachet ) twice daily 4 week . VSL # 3 select use study ( ) contain three different Bifidobacteria strain ( addition lactobacilli streptococci ) limit evidence available Bifidobacteria effective probiotic IBS ( 13 ) . A flow chart study appendix 1 . Week 4 Assessment Clinical response probiotic therapy Assessments make baseline day 28 therapy . The three symptom IBS assess determine response therapy : abdominal pain/ discomfort , bloating/ distension bowel movement , score ordinal scale ( Likert scale ; maximum score 7 ) 100mm visual analogue scale ( VAS ; maximum score 100 ) . A composite score sum 3 cardinal symptom also calculate patient ( Likert scale maximum score 21 ) ( VAS ; maximum score 300 ) . Repeat rectal sensitivity test perform . Changes mucosa microbiota response probiotic therapy Assessments make baseline day 28 . Because somewhat invasive nature repeat colonoscopy , investigator perform flexible sigmoidoscopy obtain rectal biopsy probiotic treatment . Week 4 sample IBS : 1. rectal tissue ( formalin fix histology ) 2. rectal tissue ( SERT polymorphism ) 3. rectal tissue ( mucosal microbiota ) 5ml blood EDTA ( SERT polymorphism ) Six month follow-up Patients contact 6 month reassess symptom score determine longer-term impact therapy . COLONOSCOPY Colonoscopy perform outpatient procedure conscious sedation intravenous diazepam pethidine . Subjects receive bowel preparation PEG . For flexible sigmoidoscopy , unprepared examination perform four biopsy obtain 15cm anal verge . RECTAL BAROSTAT The barostat device contain built-in computer system program automatically perform distension balloon fixed time lag bag pressure increment . Variation balloon volume constant pressure reflect change tone compliance visceral wall . Furthermore , program variation intraballoon pressure , sensory threshold subject evaluate . The patient instruct administer 4.5 fl oz sodium phosphates rectally 4 hour study home rectal cleansing . After 3-hour fast , participant position left lateral position . A barostat bag insert rectum . The barostat device connect barostat catheter use low compliance PVC tubing . After 10 minute rest , phasic isobaric rectal distension perform automatically use ascend method limit ( AML ) protocol successive increment 4 mm Hg ( 40-second duration ) alternate intermittent period bag deflation ( 40 second ) . During distension phase , participant request report perception rating press perception panel barostat device follow scale : ( 1 ) No sensation balloon distension , ( 2 ) first sensation balloon distension , ( 3 ) desire defecation , ( 4 ) maximum tolerable sensation . The procedure stop pain maximum tolerable sensation report . The sensory threshold define low limit bag pressure evoke first sensation balloon distension . The pain threshold define pressure elicit `` pain '' response maximum tolerable sensation . MUCOSAL MICROBIOTA Colonic sample take represent adherent bacterial flora . All sample store -80 degree Celsius use . Each sample add tube contain 500µl phenol : Chloroform : isoamyl alcohol ( 24:24:1 ) , 500µl 0.1mm diameter zirconia/silica bead ( Biospec Products , Barthesville , OK ) . Microbial cell disrupt mechanically 23 degree Celsius bead beater ( Biospec Products , instrument set high 2 minute ) . Isolated DNA fractionate electrophoresis 1 % agarose gel , dominant band purify MiniElute Gel Extraction kit ( Qiagen ) . Amplification bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequence pyrosequencing perform PCR . For sample , 100-200mg purified genomic DNA amplify use primer BSR357-A BSF8-B , anneal conserve region bacterial 16 rRNA gene . The PCR product sequence use 454 Life Sciences Technology Genome Sequencer FLX system ( provide Faculty Science , CUHK ) . Quality control achieve follow criterion : sequence ( ) show perfect match bar code 16S ribosomal RNA gene primer , ( ii ) least 50 nucleotide length , ( iii ) two undetermined base sequence read , ( iv ) least 75 % match previously determine 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence . Operational taxonomic unit ( OTU ) cluster analysis carry use OTUPicker . Clustering principal coordinate analysis conduct use UniFrac . Since error pyrosequencing occur rate 0.25 % , 400-nucleotide sequence remain filtering contain either 0 1 error . This level sequence error affect taxonomic analysis . The final data set colonic microbial taxonomic analysis compare 1,358,426-sequence Ribosomal Database Project Release 10 . SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER POLYMORPHISM For genotyping , DNA isolate blood platelet ( venous blood ) colon biopsy standard phenol/chloroform extraction . The 44-bp insertion/deletion polymorphism promoter region ( SERT-P ) analyse PCR sample DNA forward primer 5'-GAG GGA CTG AGC TGG ACA ACC AC-3 ' reverse primer 5'-GGC GTT GCC GCT CTG AAT GC-3 ' . The expected product size 484 bp deletion ( ) 528 bp insertion ( l ) respectively . The 17-bp VNTR polymorphism SERT gene intron 2 study PCR sample DNA forward primer 5'-GTC AGT ATC ACA GGC TGC GAG-3 ' reverse primer 5'-TGT TCC TAG TCT TAC GCC AGT-3 ' . The expected product size allele 9 , 10 , 11 12 253bp , 270bp , 287bp 304bp respectively . The colonic platelet SERT protein expression also study real time PCR western blot method .</detailed_description>
