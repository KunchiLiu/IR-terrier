	<brief_title>4'-Thio-araC ( Thiarabine ) Advanced Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Thiarabine design damage destroy DNA cancer cell . This may cause cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 study group base join study . The first set 3 participant enrol Group 1 , 2nd set 3 participant enrol Group 2 . The 3rd set 3 participant enrol Group 1 , 4th set 3 participant Group 2 , participant enrol . - Group 1 receive thiarabine 3 day row cycle . - Group 2 receive thiarabine 5 day row cycle . Cycles study 3-6 week long , depend . You may begin new cycle blood cell count return appropriate level . However , may begin new study cycle earlier disease get bad improve . The dose thiarabine receive depend join study . The first set participant receive low dose level thiarabine . Each new set receive high dose thiarabine set , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose thiarabine find . Study Drug Administration : You receive thiarabine vein 1 hour ( +/- 15 minute ) Days 1-3 ( Group 1 ) Days 1-5 ( Group 2 ) cycle . Study Visits : Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test 1 2 time week . If disease responds well , study doctor may decide blood test occur less often . At every study visit , ask drug may take symptom may . You ECG within 2 day cycle . At time doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . Length Participation : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You take study early intolerable side effect occur . You may take study early disease get bad . Follow-Up : At 30 day last study drug dose , ask side effect may . This may do regular clinic visit phone call study doctor staff . This investigational study . Thiarabine FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 70 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients poorrisk myelodysplasia ( MDS ) [ i.e . refractory anemia excess blast ( RAEB1 RAEB2 ) WHO classification ] chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) also candidate protocol . Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute nonlymphocytic leukemia ( AML ) WHO classification , acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) , chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) blast crisis . 2 . Patients refractory/relapsed leukemia 16 year older eligible . Patients 60 year old newly diagnose AML eligible candidate , refuse , intensive chemotherapy . 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 03 . 4 . Women childbearing potential ( ie , woman postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month undergone previous surgical sterilization ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , must negative urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior begin treatment trial . Nursing patient exclude . Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study . 5 . Continued # 4 : Pregnant nursing patient exclude effect 4'thioaraC fetus nursing child unknown . 6 . Must able willing give write informed consent 7 . In absence rapidly progress disease , interval prior treatment time study drug administration least 2 week cytotoxic agent least 5 halflives noncytotoxic agent . If patient hydroxyurea control peripheral blood leukemic cell count , patient must hydroxyurea least 24 hour initiation treatment protocol . Persistent clinically significant toxicity prior chemotherapy must great grade 1 . 8 . Patients must follow clinical laboratory value unless consider due leukemic organ involvement : 1 . Serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.3 mg/dl creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min . 2 . Total bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5* upper limit normal unless consider due Gilbert 's syndrome . 3 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; /= 3* upper limit normal unless consider due organ leukemic involvement . 9 . Patients active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement leukemia disease include treat concurrently intrathecal therapy . 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited uncontrolled infection ( e.g . require IV antibiotic , etc ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 2 . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 , arrhythmias control medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure define Class II IV per New York Heart Association Classification . 3 .
