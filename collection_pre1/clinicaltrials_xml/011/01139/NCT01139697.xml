	<brief_title>Hair Cortisol Testosterone Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Progression chronic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) associate abnormal secretion several hormone include glucocorticoid testosterone . A single study patient chronic heart failure demonstrate high serum level cortisol independent predictor increase mortality risk . However , study include patient heart failure admit hospital due cause might speculate single serum cortisol measurement take may influence acute illness emotional stress associate admission . Currently , several modality measure cortisol level include serum , urinary salivary technique . However , method represent indicator acute cortisol secretion reflect accumulation hormone time . Recently grow interest measure hair cortisol level . Hair grow approximately 1 centimeter per month therefore hair analysis accurately reflect long-term endogenous production cortisol . This provide first time reliable mode measurement accumulation cortisol time . We recently demonstrate high hair cortisol level patient acute myocardial infarction compare control ( manuscript submit publication ) . Regarding testosterone , several study recently demonstrate low free serum testosterone level patient heart failure compare control . Furthermore , Serum testosterone level inversely correlate heart failure status . The longitudinal assessment cortisol testosterone level time use hair technique may superior single random serum sample assessment chronic heart failure status prognosis . If indeed , hair cortisol testosterone level would correlate heart failure status , may use quantitative mode clinical follow-up CHF patient ( similar role HbA1C follow-up diabetic patient ) . However hypothesis yet evaluate</detailed_description>
