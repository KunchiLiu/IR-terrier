	<brief_title>Safety Live Attenuated Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 2 ( HPIV2 ) Vaccine Adults , Children , Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HPIV2 virus cause severe respiratory illness , pneumonia bronchiolitis , infant young child . Approximately 3 % hospitalization respiratory tract disease among infant child result HPIV2 . Efforts develop vaccine HPIV2 focus live attenuate intranasally administer vaccine , type vaccine use live virus modify make weaker easy immune system get rid . This approach useful several reason : activates two body 's natural defense , antibody-mediated cell-mediated response ; immunogenic infant still maternal antibody ; induces mucosal immune response . This study test safety immunogenicity HPIV2 vaccine adult , child , infant . This study four group proceed step-wise fashion . The first group consist adult receive HPIV2 vaccine . If deem safe , child age 15 59 month already HPIV2 antibody randomly assign receive either vaccine placebo . The third group include infant child 6 59 month old HPIV2 antibodies randomly assign either low dose vaccine placebo . The fourth group also include infant child 6 59 month old HPIV2 antibodies randomly assign standard dose vaccine placebo . The vaccine administer nose drop single dose group . Assessments first two group take place 11 day follow administration vaccine 28-day follow-up . The third fourth group include 22 day assessment vaccination , one assessment Days 23 26 , assessment Days 27 , 28 , 29 , 56 . Measures include clinical assessment , nasal wash , phone report , take temperature . Measurement serum HPIV2 antibody take place baseline 28 ( group one two ) 56 ( group three four ) day .</detailed_description>
