	<detailed_description>Cognitive behaviour therapy cognitive training work rehabilitation person severe mental illness . A randomised control trial Introduction This study compare effect cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) cognitive train work rehabilitation patient severe mental illness ( psychosis ) . These intervention compare match control group ( 'treatment usual ' ) . The patient recruit nine different county Norway . During two-year period around 27-30 patient recruit county , mean intervention arm contain approximately 80 patient . The evaluation patient include several validated diagnostic instrument describe detailed description . The county randomise two different intervention group : 1. group receive CBT inspired work rehabilitation , 2. group receive work rehabilitation integrate cognitive training . The control group match accord gender age . With Ntotal=160 comparison two group ( 80 patient x 2 ) , 0.05 level significance power 0.80 , standardise group difference 0.44 detect . The standardised difference detect supported employment treatment usual high 0.80 comparable American study , indicate N large enough present study . The participant county evaluate follow local project coordinator District Psychiatric Centre ( DPS ) , local psychiatrist/psychologist . Written evaluation protocol send anonymously research centre registration . Data store accord current law person protection data security . Pre-post difference group , difference control group intervention group , difference intervention group test use mixed linear model programme . Background Vulnerability stress schizophrenia Schizophrenia mental disorder characterise psychotic symptom , apathy , social isolation cognitive problem , often reduce functional capacity central life arena . Patients problem school work , parent friend , severe case able live cope challenge daily life ( Mueser &amp; McGurk 2004 ) . Schizophrenia one ten important cause severe chronic disability ( Velligan &amp; Gonzales 2007 ) . The course disease perhaps best described understood so-called stress/diathesis model . According model person psychobiological vulnerability basically determine genetic perinatal environmental factor . The debut course disease determine dynamic interplay biological psychosocial factor . Medication use legal illegal drug important biological factor . Antipsychotic medication reduce symptom intensity probability relapse , whereas drug abuse often opposite effect . The important psychosocial factor perceive stress , social support , patient 's cop profile . High level stress increase biological vulnerability , symptom intensity , relapse probability , whereas social support development social ability problem solve skill tend protect individual . Cognitive behaviour therapy Cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) schizophrenia originally develop help patient cope delusion hallucination respond medical treatment . CBT assume delusion hallucination influence person 's problem sort interpret information , cognitive intervention increase coping ( Velligan &amp; Gonzales 2007 ) . Therapist patient examine content symptoms detail , explore whether symptom understood new functional way . Controlled study clearly support efficacy CBT schizophrenia ( Tarrier &amp; Wykes 2004 , Turkington et al 2004 ) . The explanatory model CBT , include core concept schema , automatic thought , socratic questioning , alternative thought , colour rehabilitation programme schizophrenia . Cognitive training It previously assume reason person psychotic disease problem daily life reduce sense reality , delusion hallucination . Today consensus problem far complex . Research show neurocognitive dysfunction prevalent person schizophrenia , rather stable dysfunction important prognostic factor ( Velligan et al 1997 ) . The patient problem memory , attention , problem solve capacity , reduce psychomotor speed . It demonstrate neurocognitive dysfunction impact strongly activity daily life positive symptom psychosis , predict cop strongly negative symptom ( Green et al 2000 ) . Neurocognitive dysfunction impair person 's ability learn new skill , social relation , academic capacity work capacity . It particularly manifest attention concentration problem , complex work task must solve time pressure . Consequently , many patient problem handle job academic course demand speed mental flexibility . They serious problem qualify job , employ tend loose job often worker , adverse social , economic mental consequence . These patient also strive cope rehabilitation project involve many people ( Bell &amp; Bryson 2001 ) . Today several researcher maintain neurocognitive dysfunction key problem schizophrenia . These finding produce new rehabilitation programme aim develop restore neurocognitive function ( McGurk et al 2007 ) . Cognitive rehabilitation focus improve function ) reinforcement reestablishment previously learn behaviour , b ) establishment new cognitive ability compensatory mechanism impaired neurological system ( Harley et al 1992 ) . These method many year use successively treatment patient brain damage . Great progress make field last two decade , train programme also available person mental disorder . The effect cognitive rehabilitation examine controlled study show neurocognitive function improve structured training ( Ueland &amp; Rund 2005 ) , consequence psychosocial adaptation may improve . Work rehabilitation schizophrenia The National Norwegian Development Plan Mental Health ( Opptrappingsplanen psykisk helse ) state work meaningful activity important source social identity self esteem . Work rehabilitation patient schizophrenia psychotic disorder traditionally great challenge Norway country . Even though half patient want job , minority employ ( McGurk &amp; Mueser 2004 ) . Chronic social dysfunction make difficult compete effectively ordinary job market . Optimal treatment symptom combine cognitive training increase competence may somewhat improve chance , recent study indicate many patient adjustment job demand necessary addition continue support cope job ( Drake et al 1999 ) . More 50 % participant cope support employment programme US , compare 20 % control group . Programmes combine cognitive training support employment seem particularly promising ( Wexler &amp; Bell 2005 , McGurk &amp; Mueser 2004 ) . These programme reduce stress personal support tailor job demand , increase competence cognitive training . Prejudice lack openness understanding still prevalent work place , tend prevent successful work rehabilitation patient psychotic disorder . Like family member leader colleague may easily perceive symptom incomprehensible frightening expression laziness hostility , react negatively correct , adverse consequence . In pilot project investigate whether psycho-educative method could adapt use work rehabilitation patient severe mental disorder . The goal project examine whether psycho-educative method use work rehabilitation increase chance person severe mental disorder cope job , , secondly , develop good model collaboration welfare institution improve work rehabilitation person severe mental disorder . Two external evaluation pilot project conclude psycho-educative method cognitive method adapt work rehabilitation context , organise collaboration clinician job consultant great potential . The participant generally stable evaluated experience positively . The engagement pilot project grow time work welfare system psychiatric health care system ( DPS ) , decide spread project nine different county . Research question The present project compare effect cognitive behaviour therapy cognitive training regard ability person severe mental disorder cope keep job . The two intervention arm compare matched treatment usual control group . Hypotheses 1 . By end project ( T2 ) follow examination ( T3 ) global psychosocial function patient higher CBT work rehabilitation group control group 2 . The global psychosocial function patient T2 T3 higher cognitive train group control group Material Method Material Persons DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorder start work rehabilitation recruit nine different county Norway . From county around 27-30 patient recruit two-year period , give total little less 250 patient . Method Instruments The following instrument use : Diagnosis : The MINI interview ( Sheehan et al 1997 ) . Intensity positive negative symptom : The Health Nation Scale ( HoNOS , Wing et al 1996 ) , The Apathy Evaluation Scale ( self rating version ) ( Marin et al 1991 ) , PANSS ( Key et al 1987 ) . Global functioning : The Global Assessment Functioning Scale ( GAF ) ( APA 1987 ) . Complicating drug abuse : The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT ) ( Saunders et al 1993 ) Drug Use Disorders Identification Test ( DUDIT ) ( Bermann et al 2005 ) . Cognitive functioning : The Measurement Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRIX ) -battery ( Marder et al 2004 ) . Relations leader colleague : The Felt Expressed Emotion Rating Scale ( FEERS , Bentsen 1999 ) . Work performance : The Work Behavior Inventory ( Bell et al 2004 ) Intervention CBT work rehabilitation : The content psychoeducative class pilot study adjust standardise . Classes offer employee participate company . Central theme symptom , course , method treatment , rehabilitation , relapse prevention prognosis schizophrenia psychosis . The core element basic way reason CBT ( schema , automatic alternative thought ) particularly emphasise . The DPS supervisor county meet job consultant weekly whole project period easily available consultation telephone . The central supervision focus current communicative behavioural problem work site . Attempts solve problem continuously include participant . Each participant offer 10 month project . Cognitive training : The cognitive training computer base use programme package develop dr. psychol . Torill Ueland . The programme include train attention , memory , executive functioning , psychomotor speed . Computer base training allow multi-sensoric feedback positive reinforcement . Moreover , computer base training use individually degree difficulty vary . This important since neurocognitive profile function vary among patient . Group train economically attractive since one person administrate programme six person simultaneously . The programme package adapt Norwegian context , selection task base international research . It combine task originally develop patient brain injury ( Cog Rehab ) task develop psychiatric patient ( Cogpack ) . Tasks source use several previous study ( Bell et al 2001 , McGurk et al 2005 ) . Design Six county randomise one ( n=80 ) two intervention group . A matched control group ( treatment usual , n=80 ) establish three county . With total N=160 comparison two group , significance level 0.05 power level 0.80 , standardise group difference 0.44 detect . The standardised difference support employment treatment usual comparable American study high 0.80 ( Velligan &amp; Gonzales 2007 ) , mean N acceptable present project .</detailed_description>
