	<brief_summary>This study attempt learn good treat trauma patient delirium breathing machine . Delirium , also know acute , temporary brain dysfunction , common reason ventilate patient wean breathe machine even though lung may healthy enough breathe without machine . The study hop show decrease patient 's delirium lead quicker wean breathe machine possibly quicker overall recovery well . Patients enrol study treat Clonidine placebo . Clonidine drug produce significant calming effect , decrease anxiety , reduces pain , low incidence delirium medication use ICU purpose . Clonidine approve Federal Food Drug Administration treatment delirium , commonly use purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Transdermal Clonidine Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obtaining appropriate level sedation analgesia severely injured trauma patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) challenge due diversity injury well breadth comorbidities present population . Clonidine may useful adjuvant traditional analgesic opioids sedative benzodiazepine propofol . Ventilator dependent trauma patient frequently fail extubation trial secondary inappropriate sedation , inadequate analgesia undertreated delirium . Patients fail extubation reason potentially preventable prolonged ventilator , ICU hospital course . Ventilated trauma patient meet criteria institution 's SBT protocol diagnosis delirium consider trial document failed SBT . We hypothesize treatment patient population transdermal Clonidine decrease delirium trauma patient ICU stay . Patients enrol treatment group receive oral load dose Clonidine 0.3 mg placement Clonidine Transdermal system dose 0.3-mg/day ( Catapres TTS-3 ) cover patch overlay . In 12 hour patient receive second final dose Clonidine 0.3 mg . The placebo group receive placebo oral tablet overlay patch 12 hour receive second final placebo tablet . A total 120 patient enrol , 60 patient group . All patient complete study end Day 14 upon discharge hospital , whichever come sooner . Ventilator time measure group well prevalence delirium amount positive CAM-ICU score course trial .</detailed_description>
