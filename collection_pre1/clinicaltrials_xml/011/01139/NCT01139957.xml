	<brief_title>Incidence Cancer Women Increased Genetic Risk Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prospective incidence ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , breast cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , cancer among woman increase risk ovarian cancer , special emphasis woman know breast cancer susceptibility gene ( BRCA ) 1/2 mutation carrier . II . To develop precise point estimate cancer rate among woman undergone risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy woman elect screen . III . To compare cancer rate two group woman . IV . To good characterize similarity differences cancer risk BRCA mutation-positive family BRCA mutation-negative/family history-positive family . V. To develop preliminary estimate overall cancer-specific mortality , stratify mutation status ( BRCA1-positive , BRCA2-positive , BRCA1/2-negative ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients complete Health Update Questionnaire annually 5 year . The questionnaire focus specifically cancer risk , incidence , mortality . Patients also receive ongoing communication ( e.g. , periodic newsletter , copy study-related publication , etc . ) keep inform regard study-related research result , new research finding , new research opportunity patient may eligible , evolve clinical recommendation regard hereditary breast/ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
