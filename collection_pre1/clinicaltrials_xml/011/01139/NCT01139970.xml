	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose give veliparib together temozolomide treat patient acute leukemia . Veliparib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving veliparib together temozolomide may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib Temozolomide Treating Patients With Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ABT-888 ( veliparib ) administer combination temozolomide patient acute leukemia . II . To evaluate feasibility , safety , toxicity administer ABT-888 combination temozolomide patient acute leukemia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document response acute leukemia . II . To observe pharmacokinetics ABT-888 temozolomide administer alone combination . III . To study pharmacodynamics determine level poly ( ADP-ribose ) ( PAR ) administration ABT-888 temozolomide patient leukemia blast , analyze methyl-guanine methyl-transferase ( MGMT ) protein level primary leukemia blast , quantify induction gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( y-H2AX ) RAD51 recombinase ( RAD51 ) foci patient leukemia blast treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 twice daily day 4-12 temozolomide PO QD day 3-9 course 1 . Beginning least 30 day start treatment , patient receive veliparib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-8 temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission receive 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
