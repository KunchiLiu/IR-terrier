	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage IV Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( RR ) associate pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) 3rd-line therapy metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( mRCC ) patient fail therapy distinct vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine baseline hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , endothelial selectin ( E-selectin ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) associate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To determine pre-metastatic niche density regional lymph node ( LNs ) associate PFS . III . To determine association E-selectin , IL-6 pre-metastatic niche density . IV . To evaluate prognostic effect pre-metastatic niche independent factor time first relapse . V. To determine phosphorylated signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( pSTAT3 ) tumor tissue associate PFS . VI . To describe toxicity associate pazopanib patient population . VII . To evaluate PFS overall survival ( OS ) . VIII . To compare , within patient , time tumor progression 2nd-line therapy time tumor progression pazopanib 3rd-line therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
