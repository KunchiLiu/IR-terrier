	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate transgene expression ( synthesis FGF-1 mRNA ) inject tissue , injection site , Intra Muscular ( IM ) administration increase single dos NV1FGF . Secondary objective : - To evaluate safety tolerability IM administration increase single dos NV1FGF - To evaluate transgene expression ( FGF-1 protein ) inject tissue ( injection site remote site ) - To evaluate presence FGF-1 receptor inject tissue ( injection site remote site ) - To evaluate NV1FGF biodistribution inject tissue ( injection site remote site ) , multiple organs/tissues appropriate , plasma - To evaluate transgene expression ( synthesis FGF-1 mRNA ) inject tissue remote site - To collect data plasma NV1FGF pharmacokinetics - To evaluate heal amputation site</brief_summary>
