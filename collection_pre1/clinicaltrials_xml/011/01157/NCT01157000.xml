	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Bioavailability Study 28431754 ( Canagliflozin ) Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( patient know identity treatment receive ) , single-dose , single-center study evaluate absolute oral bioavailability ( rate extent drug absorb body reach blood circulation ) 300-mg tablet canagliflozin . Approximately 9 healthy men ( refer healthy male volunteer ) receive single 300-mg tablet canagliflozin 8 ounce glass water follow 105 minute later 15 minute intravenous ( iv ) infusion ( administration directly vein ) small dose ( ie , 10 microgram [ mcg ] ) canagliflozin combine radioactive carbon isotope refer 14C canagliflozin . The radiolabelled 10 mcg dose canagliflozin act tracer measure total amount canagliflozin absorb metabolize body . After dose , blood , urine feces sample collect pharmacokinetic safety evaluation specify timepoints 72 hour . The primary outcome measure study determine absolute bioavailability single 300 mg dose canagliflozin estimation protocol-specified standard plasma pharmacokinetic parameter ( parameter measure absorption , distribution , metabolism , elimination drug body ) blood sample obtain study . During study , safety single oral 300-mg dose canagliflozin administer together single iv 10-mcg infusion dose 14C-canagliflozin evaluated monitoring adverse event finding clinical laboratory test value , physical examination result , 12 lead ECGs vital sign measurement report . On Day 1 , healthy volunteer take single 300-mg canagliflozin tablet orally ( mouth ) 8 ounce water morning follow 15-minute intravenous infusion 10 mcg 14C-canagliflozin ( 200 nCi ) ( equivalent 0.666 mcg/mL canagliflozin ) . Healthy volunteer fast least 10 hour dose least 4 hour oral administration allow drink water 2 hour 4 hour study drug administration .</detailed_description>
