	<brief_summary>Background : Few study examine predictor clinical course subject frozen shoulder syndrome explain persistence symptom appropriate therapy . Altered shoulder kinematics may predispose subject subacromial impingement , rotator cuff tendonitis , alter shoulder joint force , possible degenerative change . Subsequently , difficult chronic course frozen shoulder syndrome may develop . Objective : The purpose study : ( 1 ) develop prediction method determine alter shoulder kinematics associate muscular activity associate chronicity frozen shoulder dysfunction , ( 2 ) validate prediction method analyze impact method clinical behavior . Design : For first year , prospective study conduct develop prediction method identify impair shoulder kinematics associate degree symptom-related functional disability patient frozen shoulder syndrome . For second third year , validation propose prediction method determine whether altered shoulder kinematics associate muscular activity subject intervention meet prediction criterion demonstrate improvement follow-up , show improve decision make clinical practice .</brief_summary>
