	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment one symptoms Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , may occur first year disease . It usually affect attention , information processing speed short term memory . To date , mechanism specific symptom remain unclear ( local global inflammation , neurodegenerative process ) . Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) useful understand pathophysiology cognitive impairment MS . The investigator combine conventional non conventional MRI sequence determine respective role white matter grey matter injury cortical reorganization neuronal network .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) occur 50 % patient major social impact . There clear correlation cognitive dysfunction disease duration recent study point may affect patient early stage disease especially tasks involve sustained attention , process speed , work memory executive function . Recent image pathology study show MS affect white matter well grey matter . Unlike white matter lesion burden distribution , grey matter atrophy often link cognitive impairment . Microscopic injury Normally Appearing White Matter ( NAWM ) explore non conventional MRI sequence also show involved pathophysiology cognitive disorder . Nevertheless mechanisms cognitive impairment remain unclear . The relationship cortical injury diffuse white matter tract damage respective contribution cognitive dysfunction affect patient first year disease still investigation . This study aim investigate structural functional correlate early cognitive impairment use multimodal MRI . Relapsing Remitting MS ( RRMS ) patient disease duration le 5 year include . Patients without cognitive impairment compare healthy control . All subject perform clinical neuropsychological evaluation MRI examination . We combine new available MRI technique use 3 Tesla magnet order evaluate precisely cortical white matter tract lesions patient cognitive MS . These technique include : - 3D T1 sequence study cortical atrophy use VBM . - Diffusion tensor image fibre track study select white matter tract may involve cognitive disorder , thalamus-cortical striatum-cortical tract connect sub-cortical structure prefrontal cortex . - Functional MRI sequence work memory task rest state order describe functional network possible reorganization patient without cognitive impairment .</detailed_description>
