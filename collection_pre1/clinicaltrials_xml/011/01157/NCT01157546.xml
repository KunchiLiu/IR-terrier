	<brief_summary>This prospective , double blind , randomize study propose patient undergo open radical prostatectomy : objective establish whether continuous bilateral TAP block would provide adequate perioperative analgesia , decrease opioid consumption , reduce incidence opioid-related side effect , facilitate surgical recovery ( term PACU hospital discharge ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TAP Block Open Radical Prostatectomy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open prostatectomy surgical procedure perform urologist excise prostate . This achieve 10-cm vertical incision start umbilicus reach pubic area . Patients hospitalize 3-4 day : one criterion safe discharge include Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) pain 3 rest . For postoperative pain control , patient receive patient-controlled opioid analgesia ( PCA ) morphine . The average amount morphine use first 24 h varies 30 50 mg . Although technique widely use , side effect ( sedation , ileus , pruritus ) commonly encounter opioid administration . Thus alternative analgesic technique epidural analgesia wound infiltration use success . However adverse event also report technique ( low limb motor block epidural ; infection wound infiltration ) . In last 10 year , new technique , transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block , anesthetize thoracolumbar nerve ( intercostal , subcostal first lumbar nerve ) , describe . The thoracolumbar nerve provide sensory innervation anterolateral abdominal wall . The traditional technique TAP block perform blunt needle Triangle Petit . The latter delineate caudally iliac crest , posteriorly latissimus muscle anteriorly external oblique . Two distinct pop felt needle cross fascial extension external oblique internal oblique muscle , respectively . Thus second pop usually signify needle tip reach TAP . Although traditional technique use provide postoperatively analgesia bowel surgery , hysterectomy Cesarian Section , position Triangle Petit vary greatly thus make difficult palpate obese patient . In 2007 , study describe ultrasound-guided technique TAP block : author advocate use ultrasonography locate TAP along mid-axillary line iliac crest . This ultrasound-guided technique subsequently use provide postoperative analgesia laparoscopic cholecystectomy , appendicectomy Cesarian Section . This technique show spare opioids postoperative period therefore facilitate accelerated discharge superior pain relief . In institution , TAP block , either single shot continuous catheter infusion , use abdominal urological surgery epidural blockade feasible .</detailed_description>
