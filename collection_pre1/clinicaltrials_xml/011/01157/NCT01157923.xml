The objective feasibility study evaluate efficacy safety automate determined Insulin pump setting ( i.e. , basal plan , correction factor , carbohydrate ration insulin activity time ) use MD-Logic Pump Advisor individual type 1 diabetes.The study consist two segment : ( I ) pilot study , 30-78 day trial evaluate MD-Logic pump advisor ( II ) randomize control 30-78 day trial compare MD-Logic pump algorithm standard care.In segment 1 , pilot study , aim enroll 15-30 subject without control group . In segment 2 , randomize control segment , aim enroll 92 subject , enrol 105 eligible subject allow dropout . The randomized control study segment initiate pilot segment.Each segment study consist 6 clinic visit take place interval 1-3 week , sum 30-78 day study duration segment . Before clinic visit , subject wear continuous glucose sensor 6 day ; intervention group 4 iteration ( e.g pump set review adjust 4 time study period accord MD-Logic Pump Advisor ) .For control group ( segment 2 ) , insulin pump setting change study period ( patient 's usual standard care ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MD-Logic Pump Advisor design Diabetes Technology Center , Institute Endocrinology Diabetes , National Center Childhood Diabetes , Schneider Children 's Medical Center Israel . The MD-Logic Pump Advisor learn adapts patient 's insulin pump setting order optimize glucose control . The MD-Logic Pump Advisor need , input , sensor reading , insulin delivery record meal home care . During collection data , patient ask continue daily routine ( need special consideration ) . The present study design test automatic algorithm evaluate change , necessary , patient 's insulin pump setting base prior sensor reading , insulin delivery , meal data collect patient regular treatment home . The objective feasibility study evaluate efficacy safety automate determined Insulin pump setting ( i.e. , basal plan , correction factor , carbohydrate ration insulin activity time ) use MD-Logic Pump Advisor individual type 1 diabetes . The study consist two segment : ( I ) pilot study , 30-78 day trial evaluate MD-Logic pump advisor ( II ) randomize control 30-78 day trial compare MD-Logic pump algorithm standard care.In segment 1 , pilot study , aim enroll 15-30 subject without control group . In segment 2 , randomize control segment , aim enroll 92 subject , enrol 105 eligible subject allow dropout . The randomized control study segment initiate pilot segment.Each segment study consist 6 clinic visit take place interval 1-3 week , sum 30-78 day study duration segment . Before clinic visit , subject wear continuous glucose sensor 6 day ; intervention group 4 iteration ( e.g pump set review adjust 4 time study period accord MD-Logic Pump Advisor ) .For control group ( segment 2 ) , insulin pump setting change study period ( patient 's usual standard care ) . Endpoints : - Primary endpoint Increase time spend normal range , define sensor glucose level within 70 180 mg/dl - Secondary endpoint Reduced time spend 180 mg/dl , reduce time spend 70 mg/dl , reduce number hypoglycemic event 63 mg/dl , reduce glucose variability , quality life measurement subject treatment satisfaction . Inclusion Criteria : - Subject Type 1 diabetes ( &gt; 1yr since diagnosis ) - Medtronic ( MiniMed Paradigm 522 , 512 , 722 712 ) insulin infusion pump CSII ( continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ) therapy least 3 month - Age ≥ 18 year - HbA1c inclusion ≥ 6.0 % - No concomitant diseases influence metabolic control - No current use CGM - Subjects participate interventional study</detailed_description>
