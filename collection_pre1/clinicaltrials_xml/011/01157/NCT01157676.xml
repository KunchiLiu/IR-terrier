	<brief_summary>This multi-institutional , randomized trial evaluate oncologic , perioperative , functional outcome follow two standard care procedure radical cystectomy . The participant one standard care procedure part care . The two procedure follow open radical cystectomy robotic assist radical cystectomy ( RARC ) . Open cystectomy consider traditional approach . While new , RARC consider equivalent open surgery perform trained robotics surgeon . The reported complication rate RARC appear comparable open surgery . This mean significant difference risk two standard procedure . However , despite potential advantage , true comparison open robotic technique regard long term cancer relate functional outcome accomplish previous study compare patient equal health status . The researcher hope learn whether patient undergo RARC recover quickly rate patient undergo open radical cystectomy non inferior cancer relate outcomes . This study fund National Institutes Health ( NIH ) .</brief_summary>
