	<brief_title>Community-based Follow-up Severely Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design . A prospective , randomize , intervention trial . Study site . The study conduct Dhaka , Bangladesh . The child recruit discharge Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B treatment acute illness , follow visit conduct HNFU CMFU ( establish ) four PHC community clinic Demra , Gulshan , Sabujbagh Mirpur thanas Dhaka city . The rationale choose four thanas high proportion child severe malnutrition come four thanas nearby area ( unpublished data ; Ahmed et al. , ICDDR , B , 2001 ) . Initial hospital-based treatment protocol . At ICDDRB , severely malnourished child treat either general ward special care unit Dhaka Hospital , accord standardize protocol [ 50 ] , similar recommend WHO [ 5 ] . Implementation protocol result 47 % reduction case-fatality rate ( CFR ) among severely malnourish child [ 51 ] accord recent observation reduction case-fatality rate 68 % ( current CFR 5.4 % ) . Criteria enrollment . Once child complete initial phase management acute problem associate severe malnutrition , consider recruitment , accord follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Age 6 - 24 month 2 . Either sex 3 . Severely malnourished [ weight age ( WA ) &lt; -3 Z score ] 4 . Resolution acute illnesses 5 . Not plan leave current residence within next six month ( purpose follow-up ) 6 . Informed consent grant guardian . Exclusion Criteria . Children follow clinical problem limitation exclude study : 1 . Persistent anorexia , fever , severe wasting ( WH &lt; -3 Z score ) edema 2 . Clinically apparent congenital/acquired disorder may affect growth 3 . Other acute chronic disease require hospitalization and/or affect growth 4 . Lack fixed address ( avoid difficulty trace follow examination ) 5 . Caregiver 's condition : child accompany caregiver able give time child care unable give stimulation due condition e.g . old age , disease , physical mental handicap . Randomization . Once child fulfill criterion entry study write consent participate grant parents/guardian , child randomly assign one five treatment package ( control interventions A , B , C D ) . Four set randomization do separately ( one set child come four thanas- Demra , Gulshan , Sabujbagh Mirpur respective nearby thanas ) accord computer-generated random number use permuted block block length five ten . The assigned treatment package keep closed opaque envelop serial number assign enrolled child . Intervention : On day recruitment ( i.e. , day discharge ICDDR , B hospital completion acute phase management ) health worker ( HW ) accompany child mother home identification home future home visit require , next day HW research assistant go home collect data quality stimulation home . At begin study , importance bring child clinical/nutritional follow follow unit ( HNFU CNFU assign ) set interval ( accord assignment ) enrollment explain mothers/caregivers . Among scheduled follow-up visit , two visit i.e . end third sixth month HNFU mothers/caregivers group advise bring child HNFU two visit . The specific component treatment package describe follow section . Standard therapy : Standard therapy include growth monitoring , health education , multiple micronutrient supplementation , clinical check . In addition , self-referral encourage entertained hour day intercurrent illness ; child suspect serious illness , ( e.g . dehydrate diarrhea , pneumonia , ear throat infection , fever , loss appetite ) admit hospital , standard treatment provide . Growth monitor promotion : During follow visit , child 's nutritional status general condition assess . Anthropometrics include weight , length/height , mid-upper arm head circumference , measure record standardized form . The health worker discuss child 's overall condition , change weight height diet respective mothers/caretakers . Health education mothers/caregivers : The major component process education provide information , show example , practice check understanding . During follow-up , mother caregiver give structured lesson ( standardize previously ) health worker cause prevention malnutrition , importance breast feeding , preparation nutritious low-cost diet locally available food item , home management diarrhea , recognition referral sign/symptoms common illness , pneumonia , seek help , use safe water hygienic practice , counsel birth space . Micronutrient Supplementation . On recruitment follow visit first three moth study , multivitamin drop , folic acid ( iron tablet ) zinc ( standard practice ICDDR , B ) provide oral administration . Iron provide week 2-12 dose 3 mg elemental iron/kg/d . Caregivers ask bring back leftover micronutrient/medicine time follow visit check compliance . Other service : Other component treatment package offer child study group include : immunization accord Expanded Programme Immunization guideline , deworming child &gt; 1 year age treatment provide last six month , counsel parent birth-spacing contraceptive , provide free cost mother . At end six month , child still WH &lt; 90 % ( &lt; -1 Z score ) , he/she invite continue attend nutrition follow clinic ( regular service component ) ICDDR , B . Follow community-based clinic : Available data 2001 show good proportion ( ~ 70 % ) under-5 severely malnourished child come four thanas ( Demra , Gulshan , Sabujbagh Mirpur ) nearby area Dhaka city . One CNFU establish thanas within already function PHC NGO clinic . One health worker contract study conduct CNFUs specify time day week . Provision supplementary food ( SF ) : Children assign treatment group B D additionally receive SF packet first three month study take-home supplementary food addition usual meal . The SF packet distribute recruitment i.e . time discharge hospital follow visit CNFU respective group . A sufficient supply packet provide ensure 1 2 packets/day 6 -11 12-24 month old child respectively next plan follow-up , consider effective base previous experience . The composition packet SF ( base supplement commonly available national supplementary feed program rural area ) : 1 ) toast rice powder 20g ; 2 ) toast lentil powder 10g ; 3 ) molasses 5g ; 4 ) soy bean oil 3g , total energy per packet ~ 150 kcal ( ~ 630 k joule ) 11 % energy protein . The ingredient buy local market prepare HNFU-kitchen . The health worker measure appropriate amount polythene packet guidance research assistant ( rice powder lentil powder one compartment , molasses soybean oil two separate compartment packet ) . Previous test reveal locally package supplement stable least two month . Caregivers ask offer packet mixed ( ) 30 ml ( ~ 6 teaspoonful ) water , bring back leftover food and/or empty packet time follow visit check compliance . Under-five sibling index child also receive SF ( accord age , state ) 1st three month ( minimize share SF assign study subject ) . Mothers/caregivers treatment group receive education prepare SF home encourage give child . Psychosocial stimulation ( PS ) : The intervention program comprise child stimulation parental counseling , conduct female health worker train give psychosocial stimulation child parental counseling , attract group attend mothers/caregivers , interact child attract play material , etc . Data collection : At begin study information seek family ' wealth , standard housing , family structure parental characteristic . At time follow-up visit child evaluate regard physical growth ( anthropometry ) , morbidity infection cognitive development behavior . The data collection method time assessment describe . Anthropometry : At baseline subsequent schedule follow-up visit health worker record child 's nude weight , use digital scale ( Seca , model-345 ) 10g precision , length use calibrate length board , head mid upper-arm circumference near mm ( non-stretch insertion tape ) , triceps skinfold thickness Harpenden caliper nearest 0.2mm . All anthropometrics take twice ; vary , third measurement do , average near two measure record . The visit end three six month hold HNFU anthropometric measurement take . Morbidity : At follow-up , health worker record child 's morbidity since previous visit pre-coded form . Diarrhea define passage three watery liquid stool per day . An episode consider new least two diarrhea-free day intervene current previous episode . Acute low respiratory infection/pneumonia define cough + rapid respiratory rate ( &gt; 50/min 6-12 month group &gt; 40/min old 12 month group ) . Fever note mother think child 's temperature elevate , cough register report result least discomfort child . Although definition somewhat subjective , plan accept definition consider constraint field situation . Children admit hospital serious illness require hospital-based treatment . Lactulose : Mannitol test : The test do randomly select sub-sample 15 child four intervention group ( A , B , C D ) . Four set randomization do separately ( one set child receive intervention A , B , C D ) . There 100 opaque envelope serial number intervention group indication Lactulose : Mannitol test mention inside envelope randomly 15 100 . Incase mother refuse immediate next mother group ask test . Three ml sugar solution per kg body weight ( 3 ml contain 400 mg Lactulose + 100 mg Mannitol + 3 ml water ) ingest morning day enrolment . After 30 minute , allow consume usual meal breast milk . A urine collection bag place child consume test dose sugar , urine collect next 5 hour . Every time child voides , urine volume measure record . One drop 20 % ( wt/vol ) chlorhexidine gluconate add sample prevent bacterial growth , approximately 3 ml pool urine sample store -20OC analysis . The procedure do end 3 month child come HNFU follow-up visit . Urinary Lactulose Mannitol ( L : M ) concentration measure Clinical Biochemistry Lab ICDDR , B use automate enzyme assay [ 55 , 56 ] . For sake comparison also collect L : M data 20 non-malnourished child ( one time ) community . Outcome Measures : Main outcome : - Rate follow - Rate weight gain - Urinary Lactulose : Mannitol ( ratio ) Other outcome : - Psychomotor development behavior - Maternal depression self esteem - Child rearing practice mothers/caregivers - Morbidities : episode percent time report diarrhea , pneumonia , fever , cough , illnesses - Changes length height , head circumference mid upper arm circumference - Mortality rate , % child remain &lt; -3Z score WA</detailed_description>
