	<brief_summary>Patients chronic hepatitis C viral infection ( HCV ) BMI great 25Kg/m2 refractory medical treatment . Also , HCV replication seem affected model insulin resistance replicon cell culture system . PPARg -agonist ( Pioglitazone ) effective control liver inflammation obese subject non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) also improve insulin sensitivity . Therefore , hypothesize improve insulin resistance /or inflammation may affect HCV replication viral kinetics . Independently PPARg pathway , Prednisone may increase HCV viral kinetics . .</brief_summary>
