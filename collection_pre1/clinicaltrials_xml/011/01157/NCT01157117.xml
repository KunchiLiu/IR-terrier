	<brief_summary>Food allergy affect 4 % U.S. population common young child . Milk allergy common cause food allergy infant young child , usually develop first year life . There treatment food allergy current standard care milk-allergic individual avoidance milk-containing product . Research underway identify potential therapeutic strategy reduce eliminate adverse effect experience milk-allergic individual consume milk-containing product . Several study suggest milk-allergic child receive milk protein oral immunotherapy ( OIT ) may become desensitized milk , result short term protection accidental ingestion milk product . However , child develop `` tolerance , '' long term protection even milk immunotherapy stop . A potential strategy induce tolerance milk use milk combination Xolair® ( omalizumab ) . Xolair consist anti-IgE molecule attach IgE , major antibody involve allergic reaction . The goal clinical trial see whether Xolair® combination milk protein OIT safer effective OIT alone induce tolerance milk milk product . Participants administer double blind , placebo control milk challenge various time point study . If desensitization achieve participant test tolerance certain time point stop treatment .</brief_summary>
