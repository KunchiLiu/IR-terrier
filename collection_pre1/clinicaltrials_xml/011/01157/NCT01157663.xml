	<brief_summary>Ankle sprain occur sport related injury . In addition , 40 % people sustain injury display residual symptoms general denominator functional ankle instability ( FAI ) . In literature , already give lot attention extrinsic intrinsic risk factor FAI . Furthermore , major focus possible intervention may able reduce chance develop chronic instability . At moment lack unequivocality . In study investigator address question effect balance training programme movement strategy . Therefore kinematics , kinetics , plantar pressure measurement muscle activity take consideration The purpose study well insight effect treatment residual symptom relate FAI .</brief_summary>
