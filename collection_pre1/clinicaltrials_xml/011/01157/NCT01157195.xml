	<brief_summary>Constraint-Induced Movement therapy , also know CI therapy , approach physical rehabilitation derive basic behavioral neuroscience research . It show efficacious rehabilitate use more-affected arm individual one year stroke mild moderate motor impairment . The first component therapy intensive training use more-affected arm functional task 3 hour daily 10 consecutive weekday . The second wearing protective safety mitt less-affected hand waking hour approximately 2-week treatment period safe . The purpose mitt discourage use less-affected arm . The third group behavioral technique design transfer gain treatment set real world , take therapist , average , 30 minute implement treatment day . The purpose project develop test method automate delivery efficacious treatment way therapy provide stroke patient ' home . After develop automate CI therapy workstation tele-health capability , investigator conduct randomize controlled trial evaluate whether CI therapy deliver home use workstation remote supervision therapist via Internet-based audiovisual link provide outcomes good CI therapy deliver `` live '' therapist .</brief_summary>
