	<brief_summary>- The Martinique island ( French West-Indies ) area high prevalence incidence Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) , respectively 64,2/ 100000 4,7/ 100000 . In many case , disease concern Afro Caribbean woman , whose auto-antibodies excessively high ; also , organic damage frequent . The disease fatal . - Studies show cytotoxic auto-antibodies may responsibility hydrolyse DNA . This study focus DNA activity also overwhelm hydrolase activity deal Lupus disease order measure link disease activity catalytic activity . Patients concerned study Martinique people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct case-control survey . - The first group patient : 60 SLE patient , 30 patient quiescent lupus 30 patient active lupus . Patients include followed University hospital Fort-de-France . - The second group control group : subject recruit French organisation responsible donation blood . Test do UMRS 872 laboratory INSERM - Laboratory Immunopathology Therapeutic immunointervention - Paris ; two catalytic activity test : DNase activity hydrolase activity . Means analyse two activity : digestion plasmid Affinity-linked Oligonucleotide Nuclease Assay DNase activity hydrolysis peptide PFR-MCA hydrolase activity .</detailed_description>
