	<brief_summary>Cholestatic liver disease common complication associate long term parenteral nutrition ( PN ) . PN associate liver disease ( PNALD ) much common premature infant incidence increase duration PN . The use intravenous omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( ω3PUFA ) fish oil recently show promise treatment PNALD . We hypothesize early marker PNALD precede increase total direct bilirubin . We hypothesize patient PNALD receive enteral ω3PUFA supplementation improvement PNALD reversal PNALD . These hypothesis test two part study include initial observation period marker PNALD evaluate , follow randomize , control trial enteral ω3PUFA supplementation treatment PNALD . Infants expect PN 4 week longer eligible enrollment study . The observational part study entail periodic assessment potential marker PNALD . Markers evaluate inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) , oxidative stress ( 8-isoprostane , 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , glutathione peroxidase ) , liver fibrosis ( TIMP-1 ) , endogenous steroid production ( glucagon ACTH ) , total serum bile acid , essential fatty acid profile , calprotectin , novel marker gut inflammation . Patients observe 6 month duration . Patients enrol study develop PNALD randomize either current standard care ( control group ) enteral ω3PUFA supplementation ( treatment group ) . Once able take oral medication , treatment group patient receive enteral ω3PUFA 1 g/kg/day 12 week . At end 12 week , protocol open label patient continue PNALD either group receive enteral ω3PUFA . All patient enrol study ( whether develop PNALD receive ω3PUFA supplementation ) follow total 6 month . The result study increase knowledge pathogenesis PNALD , well potentially confirm effectiveness novel therapy costly debilitate disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods Study Design . This two part study include initial observation period marker PNALD evaluate , follow randomize , control trial enteral ω3PUFA supplementation treatment PNALD . Patients develop PNALD eligible first part study evaluate early marker continue part two study PNALD develop . If patient transfer study site already developed PNALD , patient eligible part one , may include part two study . The investigator responsible receive informed consent enrollment study protocol patient 's parent legal guardian . The first part study observational ass early marker lead PNALD . As part research study , subject baseline serial evaluation ( every 2 week first month follow monthly evaluation 6 month ) inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) , oxidative stress marker ( 8-isoprostane , 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine , glutathione peroxidase ) , marker liver fibrosis ( TIMP-1 ) , marker endogenous steroid production ( glucagon ACTH ) , total serum bile acid , essential fatty acid profile , calprotectin ( see Appendix III ) . Other laboratory result draw per standard care PN patient , include chemistry panel , complete blood count , c-reactive protein , direct bilirubin , also record . All blood sample collect study schedule standard care blood draw , additional needle stick study participant . Nutrition data include amount protein , lipid , dextrose provide PN , amount enteral feeding record weekly duration study . When subject develop PNALD ( three consecutive direct bilirubin concentration &gt; 2 mg/dL ) , able tolerate least trophic feed ( 1 mL Q12h ) , subject randomize either control group ( current hospital practice include advancement enteral feeding , ursodiol , cyclic PN , ω3PUFA ) active treatment group ( current hospital practice plus addition enteral ω3PUFA supplementation 1 g/kg/day maximum dose 4 g/day 12 week period ) . All patient start 1 g/kg/day maximum dose 4 g/day . The dose 1 g/kg/day dose use investigator Children 's Hospital Boston investigation intravenous ω3PUFA . They also use maximum dose 4 g/day patient weigh ≥4 kg . There dose titration . Doses may divide patient receive 1 g per dose . Therefore patient weigh 3 kg receive 1 g three time daily . The maximum frequency 4 time daily . All ω3PUFA supply Lovaza ( give specific manufacturer ) 1 g liquid fill capsule . Therefore patient dose 1 capsule per kg weight maximum 4 capsule per day . As patient grow , Lovaza maintain 1 g/kg/day round near capsule exceed 4 g/day . In order administer dose nurse withdraw liquid Lovaza l g capsule give child via feed tube orally child feed tube place . Randomization take place Le Bonheur Pharmacy Department base block list random number ( i.e. , patient receive odd enrollment number randomize one group even number randomize alternative group ) . At end 12 week period , study become open label , whereby control group subject continue PNALD receive enteral ω3PUFA supplementation 1 g/kg/day . These patient also maximum dose 4 g/day weigh ≥ 4 kg . There dose titration . ω3PUFA supplementation continue PNALD resolve ( direct bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dL ) determine investigator patient receive benefit ω3PUFA supplementation . There additional blood draw phase study . All patient follow study 6 month discontinuation PN , discharge hospital without development PNALD . If study patient PNALD discharge hospital study period , patient encourage continue study receive Lovaza home remain monthly study evaluation affiliate Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic . Each study evaluation include laboratory monitoring additional 2 mL blood drawn conjunction routine clinically necessary laboratory test . This blood draw take less 5 minute . All study information gather clinically need patient assessment ( i.e . weight , feed history , medication , PN formulation ) require additional time study involvement .</detailed_description>
