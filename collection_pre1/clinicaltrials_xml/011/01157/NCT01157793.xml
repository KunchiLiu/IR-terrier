Some trial already publish subject , mainly focus bone density .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multicentre , Randomised , Open-label , Controlled Study Evaluate Effects Saizen® Cardiac Function Growth Hormone Deficient ( GHD ) Subjects During Transition Phase From Childhood Adulthood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone 191 amino acid polypeptide hormone ( MW 22,000 ) normally synthesise secrete somatotrophic cell anterior lobe pituitary gland . In normal development , growth hormone somatomedins responsible many manifestation normal growth GHD manifest mark short stature . Growth hormone deficiency treat human growth hormone many year . Serono 's r-hGH ( Saizen ) produce genetically engineer mammalian cell . The finding previous clinical study GH treatment GH-deficient adult , collectively indicate majority adult long-standing GH deficiency , whether date childhood acquire adult life , compromise physically psychologically derive clinical benefit GH replacement . Based observation clinical trial date , GH dose 0.01 mg/kg/day ( 50 % dose use child ) , likely satisfactory many subject . Moreover , possible minimise early side effect , particularly fluid retention , initiate treatment half dose increase final dose 4 week well tolerate . In study , propose enroll group childhood onset GHD subject treat r-hGH . Half study population start treatment six month whilst half remained r-hGH treatment . After six month group already r-hGH therapy continue treatment six month second group presently r-hGH treatment start r hGH treatment remain six month study . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To compare effect Saizen cardiac function ( assessed percentage ejection fraction ) subject 50 % study population start r-hGH treatment 24 week remain r-hGH treatment 24 week subject continue r-hGH 24 week start r-hGH 24 week transition phase childhood adulthood . Secondary objective : - To assess safety tolerability r-hGH subject transition childhood adulthood , assess change body composition lean body mass . Subsidiary analysis echocardiography parameter also perform . After entry trial , subject randomise one two group 48-week period : - Group 1 : Saizen ( r-hGH ) , 0.15-1.00 mg/day 48 week , subcutaneous ( s.c. ) - Group 2 : No treatment first 24 week follow Saizen ( r-hGH ) 0.15-1.00 mg/day next 24 week , s.c . Subjects ' visit study site schedule follow : - Group 1 - Baseline ( study day 1 ) , week 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 &amp; 48 . - Group 2 - Baseline ( study day 1 ) , week 12 , 24 , 28 , 36 &amp; 48 . The study drug administer subcutaneously daily evening active treatment period . The dose adjust stepwise , control Insulin-Growth Factor-I ( IGF-I ) value . The recommended final r-hGH dose exceed 1.00mg/day</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects diagnosis childhood onset GH deficiency previously treat GH Subjects attain final height Male female subject , age 14 25 year age inclusively baseline Subjects GH deficiency &lt; 5μg/L ( acquire idiopathic ) , establish 1 type GH secretion test within 3 year prior Study Day 1 If hypopituitary , subject must adequate replacement therapy ( require ) glucocorticosteroids , thyroid &amp; sex hormone ( hormone level replacement normal/mildly elevate range ) least 6 month prior study entry Subjects willing able comply protocol duration study . Subjects give write informed consent studyrelated procedure part subject 's normal medical care , understand subject might withdraw consent time without prejudice future medical care Female subject must neither pregnant breastfeeding , use hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide condom spermicide duration study . Confirmation female subject pregnant establish negative urinary human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) pregnancy test baseline . Subject know allergy hypersensitivity growth hormone diluent Subject treat rhGH previous six month Subject chronic severe kidney disease Subject chronic severe liver disease Subject acute severe illness previous 6 month Subject significant concomitant illness would interfere his/her participation assessment study Subject active malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin malignancy ) Subjects unstable hypertension ( supine systolic blood pressure persistently 160 mmHg diastolic blood pressure persistently 100 mmHg ) Subjects benign cranial hypertension Subjects history carpal tunnel syndrome , unless surgically release Subjects know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) and/or Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) serology base past medical history Subjects know active drug addiction , include alcoholism , use drug nontherapeutic purpose Subject previously participate study Subject take investigational drug enrol another clinical study</criteria>
