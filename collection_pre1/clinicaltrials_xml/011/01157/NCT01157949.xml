	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis administer Thymoglobulin® induction therapy early transplant prevents development cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) . CAV account significant number death cardiac recipient first year transplant . At 5 year post-transplant 30 % death due CAV . With exception re-transplantation available treatment CAV effective inhibiting progression . CAV involve allograft spare native artery , suggest immunologic basis disease . However , immunological non-immunological factor contribute development CAV . The established immunological risk factor recurrent rejection humoral/antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) . Non-immunological risk factor identify include preservation injury , cause donor death , donor graft ischemic time , cytomegalovirus infection1 . It hypothesize factor increase risk develop CAV cause early endothelial damage graft , could promote increase lymphocyte-endothelial interaction production anti-endothelial antibodies2 . The investigator hypothesize Thymoglobulin induction therapy would prevent development CAV polyclonal nature allow Thymoglobulin target potential mechanism contribute development CAV—T-cell activation , B-cell activation , antibody formation , induction tolerance , modulation lymphocyte-endothelium interactions3 . Because mechanism Thymoglobulin affect immune system still poorly understood , investigator also study Thymoglobulin change immune system time heart transplant recipient secondary objective .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must undergo first allograft transplant Men nonpregnant woman must 18 70 year old Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior transplantation . The sensitivity must equal least 50 mIU/mL . ( Urine test allow addition serum test patient serum result delay ) . Women childbearing potential must use two reliable form contraception simultaneously . Effective contraception must use begin study drug therapy , 4 month follow discontinuation study drug therapy . Subjects must willing capable understand purpose risk study must sign statement informed consent . Previous organ transplant Patients receive multiple organ Patients &gt; 250 lbs 114 kg Patients require VAD upon completion transplantation surgery . [ Patients require LVADs prior surgery may enrol long presurgery immunosuppressive ( see list Appendix B ) administer . ] Women lactating , pregnant , childbearing potential , use , unwilling use two reliable form contraception simultaneously study . Men use reliable contraceptive method History psychological illness condition would interfere patient 's ability understand requirement study White blood cell count ≤ 2500/mm3 , platelet ≤ 50,000/mm3 , hemoglobin ≤ 6g/dL HIV1 , HTLV1 , chronic Hepatitis B , chronic Hepatitis C infection Documented strong suspicion preoperative active infection yet adequately treat recommended course antimicrobial therapy Presence chronic myelosuppressive disease agent result either chronic leucopenia chronic thrombocytopenia Active peptic ulcer disease Patients receive within past 30 day require concomitant treatment investigational drug ( except list section 8.6 `` Concomitant treatment '' ) immunosuppressive medication prohibit study ( Appendix B )</criteria>
