	<brief_summary>The purpose study : 1 ) To assess feasibility implement clinical trial compare two potentially analgesic dietary intervention patient chronic daily headache ( CDH ) 2 ) To assess preliminary efficacy dietary intervention headache frequency severity 3 ) ass impact diet percentage omega-6 highly unsaturated fatty acid ( HUFA ) total HUFA whole blood . During 6-week baseline phase , eligible individual CDH complete web-based daily diary , self-report questionnaire , nutrient intake assessment . Before randomization one two intervention group , blood collect measure baseline nutritional biomarkers . Targeted dietary advice administer food provide throughout 12-week intervention phase . Samples biomarkers collect every 4 week intervention . Participants continue record headache characteristic daily headache diary . At conclusion intervention , participant provide complete follow-up assessment blood nutritional biomarker measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CDH characterize structural functional immune nervous system derangement . Specifically , disturbed regulation follow critically important biochemical process demonstrate : 1 ) inflammation ; 2 ) neuronal membrane excitability ; 3 ) monoamine neurotransmitter signal . Accordingly , major class medication use chronic pain ( anti-inflammatory , anticonvulsant , antidepressant ) target process . Foods consist combination nutrient molecule incorporate human tissue , enter regulate highly leveraged human biochemical pathway . By alter structure function nervous system immune system , regulate biochemical process believe play causal role development maintenance chronic pain , dietary choice may play critical role initiation and/or perpetuation CDH . Multifaceted , target dietary manipulation , direct towards correct underlie biochemical derangement , represent novel therapeutic approach management chronic pain . Improved understanding relationship dietary selection chronic pain promise benefit estimate 10 million Americans CDH possibly even large population chronic pain origin . For detailed description , please refer complete rationale literature review accompany grant application . Major research question proposal include : A . Is possible implement control dietary trial compare two analgesic dietary intervention subject CDH ? B . What preliminary estimate impact target analgesic dietary intervention headache frequency compare one another baseline headache frequency patient CDH ? C. What rate extent change % n6 HUFA two target intervention ? There also exploratory portion study gather information potential relationship nutrient pain inform intend future trial . The study need assess potential utility dietary approach chronic pain , may major public health implication .</detailed_description>
