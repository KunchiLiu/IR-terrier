	<brief_title>Study VMP001 AS01B Healthy Malaria-Naïve Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1/2a , non-randomized , open label , dose escalation study healthy , malaria-naïve adult age 18 55 year ( inclusive ) . The vaccine administer GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals ' adjuvant system AS01B . This first-in-human study VMP001 ; therefore study design incorporate dose-escalation phase evaluate 15 µg , 30 µg , 60 µg dos VMP001 500 µL AS01B . A total 30 volunteer , divide 3 group ( 10 group ) , receive 3 dos VMP001/AS01B vaccine . Group 1 receive 15 µg VMP001 , Group 2 receive 30 µg VMP001 , Group 3 receive 60 µg VMP001 immunization . The dose AS01B 500 µL group . The first second dose group separate 28 day . The third dose three group give interval schedule normalize time challenge last immunization challenge . The second third dose Group 1 separate 56 day , Group 2 42 day Group 3 28 day . The challenge occur 2 week follow third immunization . A group 6-12 infectivity control begin participation study challenge stage . They receive immunization placebos prior challenge . All volunteer receive standard treatment regimen consist chloroquine primaquine day parasitemia detect . Volunteers become parasitemic also begin treatment regimen day 28 follow challenge ( study day 126 ) . Safety immunogenicity evaluate study final study visit 6 month challenge ( study day 280 ) .</detailed_description>
