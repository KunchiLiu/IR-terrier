	<brief_summary>Background : - Laboratory investigator study common childhood cancer interested develop tissue repository collect store blood , serum , tissue , urine , tumor child cancer adult common childhood cancer . To develop repository , additional sample collect child adult diagnose common childhood cancer leukemia tumor central nervous system . Objectives : - To collect store blood , serum , tissue , urine , tumor sample child cancer adult common childhood cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals diagnose common childhood cancer ( e.g. , leukemia ) regardless patient age . - Children , adolescent , adult diagnose type cancer commonly find adult . Design : - Extra blood , serum ( liquid part blood ) , tissue , urine , tumor sample collect participant time sample require medical care part research study . - No additional procedure perform sole purpose obtain additional tumor tissue , aside require clinical care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : -Laboratory-based investigation contribute improved understanding biology cancer development new therapy pediatric malignancy . Objectives : - Systematic Molecular , Genomic , Proteomic , Metabolomic ( Omic ) profile consent patient enrol Pediatric Oncology Branch , Children National Medical Center ( CNMC ) , Carolinas Medical Center/Levine Children Hospital , collaborative institution . - Establish sample acquisition protocol collection bank pediatric solid tumor pair normal tissue support research conduct collaborative study NIH , Children National Medical Center ( CNMC ) , Carolinas Medical Center/Levine Children Hospital , extramural institution . Human sample , specimens data collect IRB approve protocol terminate may transfer continue analysis new research study . - Investigate growth factor cellular profile different pediatric adult malignancy correlate disease course measure circulating level growth factor , microvesicles bone marrow-derived cell include hematopoietic progenitor cell ( HPCs ) , endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , mesenchymal progenitor cell ( MPCs ) matrix metalloproteases ( MMPs ) blood urine pediatric adult patient without malignancy , well patient pediatric adult malignancy , determine level predict development metastasis , change treatment , undergo surgery , chemotherapy treatment immunotherapy . - Identify caregiver attitude toward use next generation sequencing ( NGS ) NIH diagnose manage pediatric cancer return NGS genetic test result incidental findings caregiver . - Evaluate anticipate short- long-term impact return NGS genetic test result cancer incidental finding quality life related bioethical outcome among NIH patient , caregiver , family system . Eligibility : - Subjects diagnosis tumor malignancy regardless age , without malignancy undergo surgery , treatment normal well visit . - Suspicion familial premalignant condition . - Biological relative subject pediatric tumor malignancy suspect familial cancer syndrome . - Biological relative subject adult tumor malignancy suspect familial cancer syndrome . - Blood and/or tissue specimens previously collect available study collect minimal additional risk subject sampling require routine patient care . Design : - This study allow collection specimen Tissue Repository , designate sample investigation include systematic molecular , genomic proteomic ( Omic ) profiling , growth factor cellular profile investigation . - Specimens collect store Advanced Technology Center , Gaithersburg , MD - Linked clinical demographic data store HIPAA compliant , secure web-based database ( Labmatrix ) . - Testing activity may include : - DNA , RNA protein extract section tumor sample , remainder store . - Germ line DNA RNA extract lymphocyte normal uninvolved tissue - Germ line DNA extract lymphocyte normal uninvolved tissue biological relative subject . - Xenografts cell line establish tumor sample - Blood and/or Bone Marrow send Coriell Institute Medical Research establishment EBV transform cell line . - Tumor sample send Molecular Response establishment Xenografts single cell suspension tumor drug test - Omics ( Genomics Proteomic ) study perform - Growth factor cellular profile investigation bone marrow-derived cell population include quantification hematopietic progenitor cell ( HPCs ) , endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) , mesenchymal progenitor cell ( MPCs ) , level matrix metalloprotease 2 9 ( MMP2 ) ( MMP9 ) , gene expression , growth factor microvesicle analysis bone marrow analysis progenitor cell blood tissue . - Research test describe IRB approve protocol ( terminate ) ( include 97-C-0050,97-C-0052 , 00-C-0092 , 02-C-0259 , 07-C-0040 , 08-C-0007 , 13-C-0152 . - Establishing oversight committee oversee receipt distribution unlinked tissue investigator . - Qualitative methodology use ascertain knowledge , attitude , belief , behavior 25-35 parents/caregivers NIH concern anticipate use NGS diagnose direct therapy pediatric cancer incidental finding might return . - Expected accrual 50-100 patient per year per center equal approximately 150 patient enrol per year . Total protocol accrual goal 2,000 patient 4000 biologic relative , 35 caregiver , total 6035 participant .</detailed_description>
