	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate child adolescent idiopathic scoliosis undergo spinal fusion use motion analysis , balance , outcome questionnaire . Little research do evaluate different fusion level impact walk pattern , range motion , posture balance follow spine instrumentation child idiopathic scoliosis . Debate still continue whether posterior spinal instrumentation last instrumented vertebra Lumbar 3 ( L3 ) provide sufficient spine correction , great motion , good posture balance compare child instrumentation Lumbar 4 ( L4 ) . Furthermore , spine fusion endpoint ( last instrument vertebra ) impact quality life , participation , impairment child adolescent idiopathic scoliosis compare healthy age-matched peer . The goal study compare two end point use gait analysis , postural stability , outcome tool hop provide well clinical care child idiopathic scoliosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population include sixty ( 60 ) child idiopathic scoliosis undergo spine surgery sixty ( 60 ) develop child `` Control Group '' . Scoliosis patient undergo period test require three visit : pre-operative evaluation , one-year post-operative evaluation , two-year post-operative evaluation . The Control Group require one initial assessment . A total 240 evaluation perform three-year period . We evaluate correlation among outcome tool quantitative measure order determine instrument use effectively well treatment . Subjects parent fully inform nature study well potential risk involve sign appropriate consent form . The study review IRB include HIPAA compliance . This accomplished test Shriners Hospital Children- Chicago Motion Analysis Lab . All possible step take assure safety convenience study participant . All subject evaluate use clinical outcome tool ( PODCI , SF-36 ) undergo quantitative 3-D motion analysis postural stability assessment . Quantitative 3-D gait analysis do 14-camera Motion Capture system passive reflective marker ( Figure 3 ) . Motion analysis perform subject walk comfortable natural speed laboratory walkway . Passive marker attach anatomic landmark standardize location use double-backed tape . Marker coordinate data use determine range motion joint angle . Four forceplates use measure kinetic data static balance . Postural stability test perform subject ( Figure 4 ) . We evaluate response dynamic stability challenge investigates motor sensory control adaptation perturbation . Static ( quiet standing ) postural stability test do subject . A licensed physical therapist ( PT ) perform exam follow protocol Shriners Hospital Children 's motion lab .</detailed_description>
