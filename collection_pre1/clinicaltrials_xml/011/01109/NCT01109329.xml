	<detailed_description>Human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) , virus cause respiratory illness , first discovered 2001 , although human infect least 50 year . HMPV may cause upper respiratory illness symptom healthy adult , old adult , adult asthma , child may risk serious illness . HMPV lead cause viral low respiratory infection ( LRI ) child , find vaccine virus could substantially reduce instance childhood respiratory illness . The National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) develop vaccine HMPV use infant , start clinical trial potential HMPV vaccine , researcher need study wild HMPV affect healthy adult . This study expose healthy adult dose HMPV virus ass ability infect , cause disease , create immune system response . Participation study last approximately 6 month . Participants admit inpatient unit , stay 10 full day . On second day unit , participant receive single dose virus , deliver via nose drop . Twice day participant inpatient , undergo physical exam vital sign record . Nasal wash blood sample collect participant receive virus , daily nasal wash collect discharged inpatient unit . Participants discharge unit 9th day receive virus nasal wash Day 8 free virus . Follow-up visit occur 28 , 120 , 180 day participant receive virus . During follow-up visit nasal wash blood sample collect .</detailed_description>
