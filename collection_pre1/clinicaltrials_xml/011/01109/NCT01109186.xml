	<brief_summary>BK virus infection frequent month follow kidney transplantation : viral reactivation observe almost 50 % patient first year . This reactivation lead viremia 10 15 % patient period . The frequent complication interstitial nephritis 2 8 % patient ( 27 patient represent 2.7 % 6 year Nantes ) . An intensive et persist viral replication , assess detection high blood viral load , could evolve viral nephropathy lead pejorative functional issue graft . Biological follow-up infection lay measure viral load . Their positivity must alert physician lead modulate immunosuppressive treatment . Actually , real consensus modality pharmacological immunosuppression decrease ( decrease dose change molecule ) . Specific lymphocytic anti-BKv evaluate several cohort patient permit prove : - weakness immune cellular response patient high viremia - increase response viral load decrease These study lay detection INFg synthesis Elispot stimulation viral antigens vitro cellular expansion . New prospective longitudinal data compare immune cellular response ( systematic early ) graft patient control BKv infection necessary improve comprehension illness natural history . The investigator propose enlarge investigation anti-BKv immune cellular response function IFNg synthesis aim detect eventual role polyfunctional lymphocytes infection control . Furthermore , investigator propose identify well diagnostic prognostic maker .</brief_summary>
