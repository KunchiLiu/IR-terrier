	<detailed_description>Two previous trial HIV preventive vaccine , refer MRK rAd5 vaccine , halt people receive vaccine great risk HIV infection . The MRK rAd5 vaccine deliver part HIV inside recombinant Ad5 ( rAd5 ) virus vector , modify version common virus usually cause serious disease . Analyses trial find increase risk HIV infection see male participant already detectable antibody Adenovirus type 5 ( Ad5 ) . A different HIV preventive vaccine develop Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) U.S. National Institutes Health ( NIH ) also use rAd5 virus vector . Although vaccine , refer VRC Ad5 , use rAd5 virus vector , structure deliver differently MRK rAd5 vaccine . In two trial Uganda show serious side effect . This study perform safety follow-ups participant two trial , RV 156A/WRAIR 1078A RV 172/WRAIR 1218 . Participants receive either vaccine placebo recruit order compare health HIV status . Participants study complete eight clinic visit 1 year 2 week . Four visit complete baseline 4 , 8 , 12 month . During visit , participant check health change complete blood draw .
