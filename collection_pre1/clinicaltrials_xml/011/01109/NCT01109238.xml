	<brief_summary>The investigator study new way make treatment decision type cancer . Technologies Van Andel Research Institute ( VARI ) available determine tumor 's molecular makeup ( gene expression profile ) . This technology ( call `` Xenobase '' ) use discover new way understand cancer potentially predict best treatment patient cancer . The researcher VARI file patent Xenobase specific network analysis method investigator use part study . A specimen obtain tumor recent surgical , biopsy , bone marrow procedure send Van Andel Research Institute . Researchers attempt identify molecular makeup within specimen , well blood urine sample patient aggressive and/or refractory cancer . This additional testing different routine test currently perform hospital evaluation cancer . The goal part study : To determine investigator tumor board committee ( minimum panel 3 oncologist 1 pharmacist ) use patient specific cancer cell make real-time treatment decision use patient specific genetic information , predict therapy generate Xenobase report .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove neuroblastoma confirmation refractory recurrent disease histologic confirmation diagnosis time recurrence/progression Patients must age &gt; 12 month diagnose age 21 Life expectancy must 3 month If measurable disease , must demonstrate residual abnormal tissue primary metastatic site measure 1 cm dimension standardize imaging ( CT MRI ) . For patient skeletal site disease , must least one persist focus increase activity pretreatment metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) scan . Current disease state must one currently know curative therapy Lansky Play Score must 30 Patients without bone marrow metastases must ANC &gt; 750/μl platelet count &gt; 50,000/μl Adequate liver function must demonstrate , define : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age AND SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 10 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age No significant organ toxicity define &gt; Grade 2 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 3 ( NCICTCAE V3.0 ( http : //ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf ) ) A negative serum pregnancy test require female participant child bear potential ( ≥13 year age onset menses ) Both male female postpubertal study subject need agree use one effective birth control method treatment six month treatment stop . These method include total abstinence ( sex ) , oral contraceptive ( `` pill '' ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , levonorgestrol implant ( Norplant ) , medroxyprogesterone acetate injection ( Depoprovera shot ) . If one use , contraceptive foam condom recommend . Informed Consent : All patient and/or legal guardian must sign informed write consent . Assent , appropriate , obtain accord institutional guideline . Voluntary consent optional biology study include . Patients receive chemotherapy within last 21 day . Patients receive antitumor therapy disease investigational drug concurrently Patients serious infection lifethreatening illness ( unrelated tumor ) &gt; Grade 2 ( NCI CTCAE V3.0 ) , active , serious infection require parenteral antibiotic therapy within 2 week prior screen Patients medical condition , include malabsorption syndrome , mental illness substance abuse , deem Investigator likely interfere interpretation result would interfere patient 's ability sign legal guardian 's ability sign inform consent , patient 's ability cooperate participate study</criteria>
