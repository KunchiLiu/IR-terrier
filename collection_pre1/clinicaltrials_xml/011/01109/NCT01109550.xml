	<detailed_description>Background : Biliary obstruction cholangitis common problem gastroenterology need specific therapeutic intervention . Besides variety potential cause , infection biliary tract Candida fungal specie increasingly report last year [ 1-6 ] . Fungal infection even lead common bile duct ( CBD ) obstruction , previously report [ 7 ] . Because difficulty gain bile sample , little know microbial flora bile . In first prospective , observational study , 123 consecutive patient undergo ERCP various indication screen fungal specie [ 8 ] . According data Candida specie may frequently detect bile ( 54/123 patient , 44 % case ) . As significant risk factor immunosuppression long-term antibiotic therapy identify . The main issue context whether positive diagnostic finding represent fungal infection fungal colonization . Especially interesting question , patient positive fungal culture bile sample treat circumstance . Study Aim : The primary aim present study evaluate wether positive fungal culture bile sample indicate fungal infection biliary tract , rather colonization simply contamination ERCP procedure . In addition mycological analysis bile sample , tissue sample common bile duct collect confirm fungal invasion . Study design : The study design single-center , non-randomized , observational study . The conducting center University Hospital Muenster , Department Medicine B , Gastroenterology . The examination perform two experienced gastroenterologist ( D. D. , H . U. ) . Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) procedure : ERCP perform use conventional duodenoscope describe literature . To exclude contamination artefact , smear endoscope work channel ( elevator ) take examination . Furthermore buccal smear stool sample take get impression individual transient flora . Endoscopic transpapillary bile duct biopsy diagnose invasive fungal infection perform . Transpapillary biopsy confirm present literature cause increase risk post-interventional bleeding infection [ 9-12 ] . Additionally routinely take blood sample ( hemoglobin lipase ) , candida-antigen-serology blood-cultures gain . Ethics : The study protocol conform ethical guideline 1975 Declaration Helsinki priori approve local ethic committee University Muenster . Statistical method : The data analyze use standard statistical method . As observational study , power-analysis reasonable - nevertheless data show confidence interval . All statistical analysis perform cooperation Department Medical Informatics Biomathematics .</detailed_description>
