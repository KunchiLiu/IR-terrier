	<detailed_description>This study compare usual follow patient see visit three month follow CVA , optimise follow include tensional auto-measure , education patient information generalist appeal AHT multidisciplinary visit resistant patient , compliance guideline . All hypertended patient able realise course tensional automeasures invite realise course tensional auto-measures three day precede visit neurology department . The tensional measure perform accord methodology recommend HAS . This strategy care conform HAS ESH recommendation regard follow hypertended patient . The hospitalised patient neurology CVA case convocated follow visit three month hospitalisation . The patient train use TAM nurse neurology depratment dropout neurology department end hospitalisation . The systematic use TAM allow identify patient present AHT `` white blouse '' , patient present masked AHT . The visit neurology department perform investigator neurology department . At end visit , two group patient identify : patient control AHT ( NI ) , patient mask non control AHT ( MASC + NC ) . Patients present control AHT `` white blouse '' AHT ( NI ) randomise . But propose sign consent acquire agreement realise exploitation data . This allow caracterise well population patient . Patients present mask non control AHT invite participate study sign consent . The collection consent do investigator neurology department .</detailed_description>
