	<brief_summary>This study patient type brain cancer call glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight cancer : antibody T cell . Antibodies type protein protect body infectious diseases possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include cell infected virus tumor cell . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , strong enough cure patient . The antibody use study call anti-HER2 ( Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ) . This antibody stick GBM cell substance outside cell call HER2 . Up 80 % GBMs positive HER2 . HER2 antibody use treat people HER2-positive cancer . For study , HER2 antibody change instead float free blood attach T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . These chimeric receptor-T cell seem able kill tumor like GBM , n't last long chance fight cancer limit . Therefore , develop way prolong life T cell help fight cancer . We find T cell work well also attach protein call CD28 HER2 chimeric receptor ( HER2-CAR ) . In study place HER2-CAR T cell pre-selected ability recognize Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . This virus exist people . These CMV-specific cytotoxic T cell ( CMV-T cell ) active since react virus well tumor cell . These HER2-CD28 CMV-T cell investigational product approve Food Drug Administration . The purpose study find large safe dose HER2-CD28 CMV-T cell , learn side effect , see whether therapy might help patient GBM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When patient enrolls study , assign dose HER2-CAR CMV-T cell . The patient give single injection cell vein IV line assign dose . The injection take 1 10 minute . The patient follow clinic injection 1 4 hour . If later subject seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological study , physical exam and/or symptom ) , s/he may able receive six additional dos T cell wish . These additional infusion would least 6 12 week apart dose level receive first time . Medical test treatment -- Before treat , patient receive series standard medical test follow : Physical exam , Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function , Routine heart function test ( Echocardiogram ) , Measurements tumor routine image study Medical test treatment -- The patient receive standard medical test get infusion : Physical exam , Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function , Routine heart function test ( Echocardiogram ) 6 week infusion , Measurements tumor routine image study 6 week infusion To learn way HER2-CAR CMV-T cell work long last body , blood take day T-cell infusion , , 1 hour 4 hour T-cell infusion , 1 , 2 , 4 6 week T-cell infusion every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 4 year , yearly total 15 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Histopathological verification glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM : WHO grade IV ) recurrent progressive disease front line therapy . HER2 positive GBM CMV seropositive Normal ECHO ( Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) normal , institutional limit ) Life expectancy 6 week great Karnofsky/Lansky score 50 great Patient parent/guardian capable providing inform consent Bilirubin 3x less normal , AST 5x less normal , creatinine 2x normal less age Hgb 9.0 g/dl ; WBC great 2,000/ul ; ANC great 1,000/ul ; platelet great 100,000/ul Pulse oximetry 90 % room air Sexually active patient must willing utilize one effective birth control method 6 month CTL infusion . The male partner use condom . Available autologous HER2.CARtransduced CMVspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes 15 % great expression HER2.CAR determine flowcytometry kill HER2positive target 20 % cytotoxicity assay . Recovered acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy least 4 week enter study . One exception Temozolomide ( TMZ ) , alkylation agent use radiosensitizer adjuvant chemotherapeutic agent GBM . Due extremely short half life TMZ , patient allow continue receive two day prior cell infusion restart six week infusion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Severe intercurrent infection Known HIV positivity Pregnant lactate History hypersensitivity reaction murine proteincontaining product</criteria>
