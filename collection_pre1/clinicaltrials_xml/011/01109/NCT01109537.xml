	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand brain chemistry people Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) . The primary hypothesis patient RLS reduce GABA level Thalamus elevate Glutamate level Anterior Cingulate Cortex . The study use MRS image examine regional level neurochemical , GABA Glutamate , brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study involve screen visit , washout period take RLS medication , night actigraphy , overnight polysomnogram , MRI scan , MRS scan . The polysomnography MR scan visit occur consecutive day . Visit 1 : Screening Visit The informed consent process study complete sign informed consent form obtain . All subject RLS undergo clinical interview order confirm exclude RLS diagnosis consistent International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group criterion determine presence psychiatric medical disorder . The follow study assessment complete : - International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale ( IRLS ) ( RLS subject ) - Clinical Global Impression-Severity ( CGI ) ( RLS subject ) - Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) - Beck Depression Inventory - Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) - Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAM-A ) - Sleep Health Centers Questionnaire - Metal implant questionnaire All woman urine pregnancy test subject urine sample drug screening collect . Washout Period Subjects RLS group require discontinue RLS medication least 48 hour prior PSG . Actigraphy An actigraph use record limb movement legs night PSG . The actigraph worn subject ' bedtime subject ' final wake time Subjects also record bedtime wake time Actigraphy Data Form . Data night actigraphy use monitor subject ' sleep . Visit 2 : Polysomnography ( PSG ) The PSG occur night prior MRS visit . The time light PSG session determine subject base self report usual bedtime . Channels include electroencephalograph ( EEG ) , electro-oculogram ( EOG ) , submental electromyography ( EMG ) , EMG anterior tibialis muscle ( separate channel leg ) , oral/nasal airflow , pulse oximetry , respiratory effort . The PSG analyze traditional sleep staging . Measures PSG include Sleep Onset Latency ( SOL ) , Wake After Sleep Onset ( WASO ) , Sleep Efficiency ( SE ) , N-REM REM percentage , Periodic Limb Movement Index ( PLMI ) PLMs associate arousal per hour sleep ( PLMAI ) . Visit 3 : MR scan Following visit 1 2 , qualify subject undergo Magnetic Resonance brain scan Brain Imaging Center McLean Hospital Belmont , MA . Prior MR scanning , subject question second time presence metallic implant fragment contraindication MR image . They ask recent alcohol , drug ( licit illicit ) , caffeine use . They also ask provide urine sample drug screening . Women take urine pregnancy test . Also , since brain GABA level affect menstrual cycle , woman schedule MR scan first portion menstrual cycle . Subjects also ask complete follow assessment MR scan : - IRLS ( modify ) - Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale ( modify ) ( MOS ) - Profile Mood States ( POMS ) - Patient Global Impression-Severity ( PGI-S ) - State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) Subjects undergo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) 4T . In addition , accordance McLean Hospital Neuroimaging center guideline , subject additionally MR screen scan either 1.5T 3T . All MR recording obtain use parameter within FDA safety guideline exposure static magnetic field , radio-frequency energy deposition , magnetic field switch rate acoustic noise level . GABA glutamate level derive MRS Scan 4T . Subjects scanner approximately one hour . At conclusion scan , subject query regard adverse effect relate MR scan . The subject complete study conclusion MR scan . During MRS 4T , patient complete modify Suggested Immobilization Test ( SIT ) . During SIT , subject ask study staff verbally rate level discomfort legs scale 1 ( discomfort ) 10 ( extreme discomfort ) . Subjects asked make rating five minute interval one hour . In case MR scan 1.5T/3T 4T MR scanner coordinate visit day McLean Brain Imaging center due schedule conflict , subject offer opportunity return McLean remain scan separate day . Subjects still offer $ 50 completion scan . Also , case data collect MR image usable ( due technical problem scanner , excessive noise measurement , etc . ) , subject may contact offer repeat MRS scan separate date . Subjects compensate additional $ 100 completion repeat MRS scan . The Primary Endpoints protocol regional GABA glutamate level derive 4T MRS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects least 18 year age Subjects diagnosis RLS use International RLS Study Group ( IRLSSG ) criteria Subjects history RLS symptoms least 15 night prior month , , treatment , frequency symptom treatment start Subjects unable discontinue prohibit medication prior sleep study 1HMRS . These include CNSactive medication . For RLS subject , RLSrelated medication ( e.g . dopaminergic agent alpha 2delta agent ) must discontinue minimum 48 hour prior PSG . In RLS group , benzodiazepine must discontinue minimum one week prior PSG . For normal control regular treatment ( &gt; 1 time/wk ) CNS active agent within 1 month screen visit also exclude . Subjects active unstable major psychiatric disorder require treatment ( e.g. , major depressive disorder ) . Subjects clinically significant depression , clinically significant anxiety , , investigator 's judgment might require intervention either pharmacological nonpharmacological therapy course study . Subjects clinical evidence untreated moderate severe sleep disorder RLS ( forRLS group ) ( e.g . obstructive sleep apnea , insomnia , narcolepsy , delayed sleep phase syndrome , etc . ) within precede year Subjects apneahypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 15 polysomnography visit Subjects consume beverage contain 400mg caffeine per day Subjects consume 14 alcoholic unit week , 5 alcoholic unit single day , month precede screen visit . Females pregnant lactating Subjects history neurologic illness ( e.g . brain neoplasm , multiple sclerosis ) , significant unstable medical illness ( e.g . congestive heart failure , diabetes mellitus ) , history significant head trauma loss consciousness &gt; 30 minute Subjects positive urine drug screening ( phencyclidine , cocaine , amphetamine , tetrahydrocannabinol , opiates ) screen visit MRS visit . Contraindications MRS scan , include : Cardiac pacemaker Aneurysm clip vascular stent , filter , clip device Prosthetic heart value Other prosthesis Neurostimulator device Implanted infusion pump Cochlear ( ear ) implant Ocular ( eye ) implant know metal fragment eye Exposure shrapnel metal filing ( sheetmetal worker , welder , others ) Other metallic surgical hardware vital area Severe claustrophobia</criteria>
