	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study type thyroid cancer seem cluster family . Non-medullary thyroid cancer account vast majority type thyroid cancer , little know possible gene may cause cancer . More research need develop best way screen familial non-medullary thyroid cancer ( FNMTC ) diagnose treat early stage . Objectives : - To evaluate natural history FNMTC . - To determine best screen strategy FNMTC . - To identify gene may indicate susceptibility FNMTC . Eligibility : - Individuals least 7 year age two first-degree relative ( e.g. , parent , child , sibling ) non-medullary thyroid cancer document diagnosis non-medullary thyroid cancer one living relative document non-medullary thyroid cancer . Design : - Participants evaluate family history pedigree , physical examination , image ( include possible neck ultrasound radioactive iodine scan ) , laboratory testing . - Participants agree blood biological sample collect ask enroll additional study provide appropriate sample tissue . - After initial study evaluation , participant find malignant thyroid tumor re-screened every year non-invasive imaging study . Participants find malignant thyroid tumor inform possible treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Thyroid cancer one fast grow cancer diagnosis United States . - Non-medullary thyroid cancer account 95 % thyroid cancer case . - Up 8 % non-medullary thyroid cancer hereditary . - Familial non-medullary thyroid cancer ( FNMTC ) aggressive sporadic disease . - No susceptibility gene FNMTC identify . - The best approach screen risk family member FNMTC unknown . - This protocol design determine natural history best screening strategy FNMTC , identify susceptibility gene ( ) FNMTC . Objectives : - To evaluate natural history FNMTC . - To determine best screen strategy FNMTC . - To identify susceptibility gene ( ) FNMTC . Eligibility : - An individual 2 first-degree relative non-medullary thyroid cancer document diagnosis non-medullary thyroid cancer one living relative document non-medullary thyroid cancer ( Note : familial study , subject need present disease ) Or Any member affect family . - Age great 7 year - Adults must able understand sign inform consent document - Adults must able complete family history questionnaire Design : - Prospective observational study . - Demographic , clinical pathologic data collect medical record patient interview patient participant family member . Data securely store computerized database . When possible , pathology slide block obtain case family verification diagnosis . - Patients evaluate family history pedigree , physical examination , imaging , laboratory test indicate . - Participants agree biospecimens collect co-enrolled endocrine tissue procurement protocol 09-C-0242 . These would include peripheral blood buccal cell sample thyroid tissue participant surgery . - After initial on-study evaluation , patient find malignant thyroid tumor re-screened every year non-invasive imaging study . - Treatment patient thyroid neoplasm perform base establish clinical guideline . - Projected accrual 20 patient per year total 15 year . Thus , anticipate accrue 300 patient protocol .</detailed_description>
