	<brief_summary>This single-center study subject undergo clinically indicate heart scan evaluation know suspected heart disease . We also include 10 healthy subject without know heart disease . We would like study stress test heart use exercise medication call regadenoson . Imaging heart perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Integrated Dual Exercise Lexiscan Positron Emission Tomography : IDEALPET</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regadenoson stress agent approve FDA use myocardial perfusion image technetium-99m single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) patient unable exercise adequately . We would like study Regadenoson conjunction Exercise Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging ( PET MPI ) . Regadenoson approve FDA use Rubidium-82 PET MPI . Also , would like study novel stress protocol Regadenoson combine symptom limited exercise stress ( FDA approve ) . The objective study assess tolerability safety combine symptom limited exercise stress test Lexiscan ( Lexercise PET ) compare Lexiscan alone ( Lexiscan PET ) , assess image quality Lexercise compare Lexiscan PET compare relative absolute myocardial perfusion image Lexercise compare Lexiscan PET identify CAD .</detailed_description>
