	<brief_summary>Previous NIH fund Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) trial child find daily stimulant therapy produce sustained growth deficit . However , federally funded study examine growth suppression associate modern day stimulant medication . Therefore , study precisely estimate risk stimulant induced growth suppression ( SIGS ) , examine underlie mechanism develop treatment . While drug holiday caloric supplementation two common treatment SIGS , little systematic investigation either . It unknown effective feasible . Therefore , use randomize adaptive design , evaluate efficacy feasibility two practice vs. routine monitoring growth 180 prepubertal child ADHD . An additional 50 subject treat solely behavioral therapy evaluate growth abnormality associate ADHD . The study ass risk SIGS ER stimulant underlie mechanism provide evidenced-based treatment management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study consist 4 part : 1 . Screening assessment determine child ADHD would good candidate ADHD treat extended release ( ER ) stimulant medication . If answer step one yes , child randomly assign receive either medication treatment extend release MPH product ( OROS MPH ) . 78 % child start option 22 % assigned behavioral therapy/counseling treatment ADHD . There placebo treatment use study . All child must age 5 12 never take stimulant medication ADHD one week eligible study . 2 . Initial Treatment Phase : The dose assign treatment option gradually adjust course first 3 month child 's ADHD well control . If child assign medication , he/she start low dose ER MPH product , gradually increase his/her ADHD good control . Children assign medication ask take every day week least first 6 month . Children assign behavior therapy ask avoid use medication first 6 month study . After month 3 medication month 6 behavior therapy ( take long behavior therapy work ) , first treatment effective , child give chance try option . If treatment cause concern side effect , he/she stop taking time provide him/her treatment option part study . 3 . Ongoing Treatment Phase : We continue provide ADHD treatment total 30 month ( 2 1/2 year ) . The dose type therapy may adjust need . The child monitor every 1-3 month time span . Monitoring include doctor visit assess growth side effect medication , regular contact his/her teacher ass function school ass function home . In total , child receive study treatment approximately 30 month require come center minimum 18 follow visit time . The average visit take 30 minute less . 4 . Weight Recovery Phase : Any child whose body mass index BMI decline concern amount randomly assign receive 1 3 weight promotion treatment stabilize his/her BMI order see prevents suppression height ( keep grow tall ) . We expect child assign behavior therapy arm need treatment , identical weight promotion treatment available child group need arises . A ) Extra monitoring : A doctor check child 's growth every month ( instead every 3 month ) his/her BMI return normal.The child stay current daily dose medication behavior therapy . B ) Caloric supplementation : Parents provide flavored calorie drink give child every night continue daily dose frequency medication behavior therapy . The child growth monitor monthly study doctor . C ) Drug Holiday : Participants take medication school day . Children assign behavior therapy participate treatment take study medication . The child growth monitor monthly study doctor . Once child 's weight recovers , extra treatment end he/she return prior medication treatment ( medication7 day week behavior therapy ) step 3 every 3 month growth assessment . Any time child 's BMI decline , extra treatment restart .</detailed_description>
