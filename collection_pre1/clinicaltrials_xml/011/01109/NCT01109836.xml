	<brief_title>Austrian Polyintervention Study Prevent Cognitive Decline After Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke second frequent cause death cognitive deficit include dementia occur frequently follow stroke . The frequency cognitive disturbance report 30 % thus occur three time frequent recurrent stroke ( 10 % ) . Major attempt make prevent occurrence new stroke mean effective strategy include preventive drug . In contrast , hardly study perform address prevention deteriorate cognitive function follow stroke . In spite high prevalence therapeutic possibility extremely limited . It must expect cognitive deficit become even frequent disability follow stroke . This cause increased age population lead increase incidence , furthermore people survive acute stroke due increase possibility acute treatment , frequent risk factor ( e.g . hypertension , diabetes ) increasingly control , thus lead less severe stroke less severe permanent motor deficit , increase potentially disable cognitive disturbance . The aim randomize control study test intensive multiple intervention therapy first time stroke add life style modification target modifiable risk factor cognitive deterioration . It hypothesize risk post-stroke cognitive decline significantly reduce compare control group standard care use polyintervention . These intervention focus nutrition , exercise , cognitive social activity monitoring management metabolic vascular risk factor . Regular contact subject shall increase motivation adherence study protocol .</detailed_description>
