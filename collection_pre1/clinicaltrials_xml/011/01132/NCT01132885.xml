	<brief_summary>Background : - Little known brain change childhood adolescence , gene affect process , brain people Williams syndrome change period . Genetic feature Williams syndrome affect brain development , detail process study time . Researchers interested use magnetic resonance imaging study brain change healthy child child Williams syndrome relate genetic disorder . Objectives : - To study developmental change brain healthy child child diagnose Williams syndrome relate genetic disorder . Eligibility : - Healthy child adolescents 5 17 year age . - Children adolescent 5 17 year age diagnose Williams syndrome genetic characteristic overlap Williams syndrome . Design : - Participants brief physical examination test memory , attention , concentration , think . Parents ask child personality , behavior characteristic , social interaction communication skill . - Both participant parent may ask complete additional questionnaire take various test require study . - Participants approximately 10 hour magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanning , usually 4 5 day , within one month period . Some test require participant specific task inside MRI scanner . - Participants ask return National Institutes Health clinical center repeat procedure every 2 year thereafter age 18 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Williams syndrome ( WS ) rare disorder cause hemizygous microdeletion approximately 1.6 megabases chromosomal band 7q11.23 , typically spontaneous mutation . The disorder characterize collection unique neuropsychiatric manifestation , include mark visuospatial construction deficit hypersociability . Because gene involve WS know , study neural mechanism WS affords privilege set investigate genetic influence complex brain function bottom-up way . Previous neuroimaging study adult WS result clear delineation WS brain phenotype . Underlying syndrome cognitive hallmark , visuospatial construction impairment , neurostructural anomaly ( decreased gray matter volume ) adjacent abnormal neural function parietal sulcus region dorsal visual processing stream . Subtle structural hippocampal alteration , along abnormality regional cerebral blood flow , neurofunctional activation , N-acetyl aspartate concentration also contribute visuospatial phenotype . Underlying syndrome social cognition feature structural functional abnormality orbitofrontal cortex , important affect social regulatory region participate fronto-amygdala regulatory network find dysfunctional WS . The finding adult WS patient create paradigm identify brain phenotype link specific gene guide research aim understanding mechanism gene effect translate brain clinical phenomenon . However , clear cognitive behavioral disturbance WS emerge course childhood adolescence complex interplay alter neural system , must study developmental translational perspective . To meet imperative , propose cross-sectional longitudinal neuroimaging study child WS track emergence modification alter neural circuitry observe adult population . With non-invasive multimodal magnetic resonance image include structural MRI , functional MRI ( fMRI ) , diffusion tensor MRI-we propose target neural system associate key clinical feature ( e.g . visuospatial construction impairment abnormal social cognition ) . We employ experimental method previously successful assess cognitive emotional processing adult population . For neurofunctional study , task paradigm optimize provide adequate statistical power single subject mapping , amenable young child . Additionally , structural MRI study allow depth track structural change , include change gray-white matter ratio integrity white matter tract throughout brain . Fifty child classic WS deletion , small deletion , duplication , along 50 unaffected sibling , study NIH Clinical Center two-year interval repeat neuroimaging study . Additionally , approximately 65 unrelated , healthy child also study . fMRI task pilot fifteen latter . We continue study child enrol protocol turn 18 order determine developmental trajectory brain structure function childhood adulthood . Additionally , fifty adult classic WS deletion , small deletion , duplication study NIH Clinical Center two-year interval repeat neuroimaging study order establish good adult end-points image protocol . Studying adult WS abnormality WS genetic region task scanner used child allow u establish adult WS comparison group child directly compare also allow u good determine maturation neural structure function WS adulthood . Typically develop child continue study turn 18 serve control comparison group adult WS . Our prior success delineate brain phenotype adult WS patient provide crucial context within view emergence modification neural circuit abnormality developmental perspective child WS launch translational study specific gene effect brain behavioral phenotype .</detailed_description>
