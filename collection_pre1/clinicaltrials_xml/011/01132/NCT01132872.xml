	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study new treatment major depressive disorder look medication treat depression act brain chemical serotonin , interact specific serotonin receptor brain cell . New method study serotonin receptor brain may help provide good understand depression treatment option . - A new radioactive chemical call [ 11C ] CUMI may useful study serotonin receptor brain . By use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan see [ 11C ] CUMI bond serotonin receptor , researcher investigate whether [ 11C ] CUMI use study depression antidepressant medication work . Objectives : - To determine usefulness [ 11C ] CUMI method study serotonin receptor brain . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 65 history psychiatric illness . Design : - This study require 8 outpatient visit NIH clinic . - Visit 1 : Participants full physical examination medical history , well psychiatric evaluation question alcohol drug use . Other test include blood urine sample electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Testing take approximately 3 hour . - Visit 2 : Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan evaluate brain function activity . - Visit 3 : Participants PET scan , small amount radioactive chemical [ 11C ] CUMI inject intravenous ( IV ) catheter , another IV line put place draw regular blood sample scan . The scan last approximately 4 hour . - Visits 4-8 : Participants regular blood test scan day 1-3 week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The blood test check muscle , heart , liver function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eighteen million people United States currently suffer Major Depressive Disorder , characterize episode low mood , poor self attitude poor vitality . Of suffer Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , one third completely improve , even among case , wait period several week antidepressant take effect . Our inability adequately treat MDD evident rank number one Disability Adjusted Life Years ( DALY ) among person age 15-44 . Given profound burden , improve understanding molecular basis MDD utmost importance development novel antidepressant medication . Serotoninergic neurotransmission implicate MDD , demonstrate relative success selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) . SSRIs block reuptake serotonin serotonin transporter , increase serotonin synaptic cleft . Serotonin bind 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor , G-protein couple receptor present presynaptically postsynaptically . Presynaptically , receptor act autoinhibitory receptor , trigger decreased firing rate decrease serotonin release . This autoinhibitory mechanism believe reason patient experience delay symptomatic improvement initiation SSRIs . Serotonin bind postsynaptic receptor mediate symptomatic improvement depression . Multiple positron emission tomography ( PET ) study 5-HT ( 1A ) publish . However , none study use 5-HT ( 1A ) agonist , specific high affinity , G-protein couple active state 5-HT ( 1A ) receptor . We would therefore like establish use 5-HT ( 1A ) radiolabelled agonist , [ ( 11 ) C ] CUMI , NIH . The purpose study perform whole body PET study healthy volunteer order estimate radiation absorb dos [ ( 11 ) C ] CUMI . Future experiment include study Major Depressive Disorder .</detailed_description>
