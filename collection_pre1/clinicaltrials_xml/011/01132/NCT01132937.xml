	<brief_summary>Background : - Traumatic brain injury may range effect , severe permanent disability subtle functional cognitive deficit often go undetected initial treatment . To improve treatment therapy provide uniform quality care , researcher interested develop standardized criterion diagnose classify different type traumatic brain injury . By identify image indicator immediately injury initial treatment phrase , researcher hope good understand nature effect acute traumatic brain injury . Objectives : - To study MRI result individual recently head injury suspect traumatic brain injury . - To study natural evolution traumatic brain injury 3 month head injury . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age admit hospital diagnose suspect traumatic brain injury within past 48 hour . Design : - Participants two 3-hour study visit : initial visit ( within 48 hour head injury ) follow-up visit 4 day later . Participants may ask optional 90-day follow-up . - Each visit involve blood sample , MRI scan ( approximately 30 minute ) , series test evaluate brain function . - At optional follow-up visit , participant blood sample , MRI scan , general traumatic brain injury assessment . - This study provide treatment replace current therapy . However , participant eligible National Institutes Health study may refer study researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective To generate natural history data cohort-based comparison serve basis future hypothesis-driven protocol contribute clinical physiological understanding traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) description manifestation injury relationship among radiological , hematological , clinical variable standard functional outcome measure . Study Population One thousand male female adult subject history recent head injury suspect non-penetrating acute TBI , enrol . Subjects vary degree TBI severity recruit collaborative program NIH non-NIH hospital . We anticipate approximately 80 % subject classify mild TBI , concussion , injury , approximately two third subject enrol discharge directly emergency department . Design This prospective cohort study subject know suspected non-penetrating acute traumatic brain injury . Subjects present emergency department trauma service participate hospital history recent head injury study course hospital stay discharge use radiological , hematological , clinical functional outcome measure . Subjects stratify accord finding cohort comparison . The design intentionally broad scope allow acquisition initial data development future hypothesis-driven protocol . Research perform protocol interfere standard care subject treat experimental therapy part research study . Data collect research study may share without personal identifier researcher subject approve option inform consent . Outcome Measures A variety outcome measure use include diagnosis , evidence injury magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) , functional impairment , quality life ( QOL ) assessment . The initial research question focus positive diagnosis brain injury monitor natural history . Statistical analysis plan develop specific research question hypotheses generate .</detailed_description>
