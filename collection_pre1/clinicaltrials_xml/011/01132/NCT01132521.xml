	<detailed_description>About 20 % patient acute pancreatitis severe course , 10-15 % severe acute pancreatitis ( SAP ) die . Despite improvement intensive care treatment past decade , effective therapy acute pancreatitis still limit . Early death ( within first week ) due severe acute pancreatitis generally cause massive inflammatory response result multiple organ failure . Although exact mechanism trigger inflammatory process completely understood , generally accept autodigestion activate leukocyte play important role pathogenesis acute pancreatitis . Activation digestive enzyme cause pancreatic injury result inflammatory response proportion response organs similar insult . The acute inflammatory response cause substantial tissue damage may progress beyond pancreas systemic inflammatory response syndrome , multi organ failure , death . UTI multivalent Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor find human urine blood , stabilize lysosome membrane inhibit lysosome function , inhibit various enzyme inflammatory response . Previous study prove protects SIRS pathophysiology subsequent organ damage induce via modulation proinflammatory mediator , well chemokines . UTI widely use treatment prevention multiple organ failure China , randomize , placebo control trial ulinastatin . A large multicenter , randomize study warrant . In study , aim evaluate effect ulinastatin treatment prevention organ failure severe acute pancreatitis regular treatment add-on trial .</detailed_description>
