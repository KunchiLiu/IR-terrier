	<brief_summary>Dental procedure wisdom tooth removal evoke high level patient ' anxiety , therefore , common practice provide concomitant pharmacologic sedation . Sedative agent administer oral , rectal , intra muscular intravenous route . The old , safe convenient route present oral route . However , Uygur-Bayramicli et al . mention administer drug orally result problem like delayed effect . Intranasal administration straightforward procedure . It simple relatively painless . Although may objectionable , less patient cooperation require oral administration , especially child must swallow medication . Many study dental sedation carry anesthesiologist ideal drug offer effect sedation analgesia . Some drug offer one effect others safe enough clinical use . Midazolam , benzodiazepine drug , traditional choice sedation , property relatively slow onset analgesia . Propofol alkylphenol sedative hypnotic agent rapid onset offset . It use patient control sedation . But analgesic property . It provide antegrade amnesia , reliable amnestic benzodiazepine drug . Because characteristic , propofol often supplement narcotic benzodiazepine . Although irritant , cause pain intravenous infusion . A new drug , alpha agonist relatively high ratio α2/α1-activity ( 1620:1 compare 220:1 clonidine ) theα2 receptor dexmedetomidine . This property may lead potent effect sedation analgesia without unwanted cardiovascular effect fromα1 receptor activation . Most data evaluate use dexmedetomidine intensive care unit ( ICU ) obtain immediate postoperative period , mainly patient underwent open-heart surgery . Currently , clinicians await study broader patient population . In study complete date , sedation attain easily maintenance respiratory function . Patients readily arousable . There minimal increase blood pressure initially , follow slight decrease blood pressure . Lower dose range , avoidance rapid bolus injection , slow rate administration tend decrease circulatory side effect . So many clinical study show well safely use intravenously , intramuscularly transdermally . Although officially technique , also report intranasal administration result fairly predictable onset adult child . The investigator propose intranasal help improve postoperative pain relief good sedation .</brief_summary>
