	<brief_summary>Patients cutaneous T cell lymphoma experience refractory progressive disease despite current treatment , necessitate chronic disease management . In addition , need great emphasis combination treatment , correlate increase response rate , rapid onset response , decreased side effect profile compare monotherapy . The goal use Lenalidomide adjuvant treatment patient refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma increase response rate , maintain durable long-term response , relieve associate symptom , minimize toxic side effect .</brief_summary>
