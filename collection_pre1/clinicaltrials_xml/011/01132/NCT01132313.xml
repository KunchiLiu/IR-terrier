	<brief_summary>The substance BI 201335 BI 207127 develop treatment chronic hepatitis C virus infection . BI 201335 BI 207127 work prevent virus replicating . The currently available medication pegylated interferon alfa ribavirin hepatitis C ca considerable adverse event patient many case sufficiently effective . This particularly case treatment patient infect genotype 1 HCV . A combination therapy new substance without pegylated interferon alfa may associate few adverse event currently available ( pegylated interferon-alfa-based ) medication may also provide treatment option large number patient contraindication intolerance pegylated interferon alfa . This clinical trial ( 1241.21 ) currently consist 3 distinct study : Part 1 , Part 2 Part 3 . Part 1 ( SOUND-C1 ) 2 arm study describe experimental arm 1 2 ( actual enrollment : 56 patient ; randomize treat : 32 ) Part 2 ( SOUND-C2 ) 5 arm study describe experimental arm 3 7 ( actual enrollment : 465 ; randomize treat : 362 ) Part 3 ( SOUND-C3 ) include 3 arm describe experimental arm 8 10 ( 83 patient randomize treat )</brief_summary>
