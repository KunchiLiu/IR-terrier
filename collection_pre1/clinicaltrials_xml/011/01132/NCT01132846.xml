	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine benefit safety intravenous administration low dose nesiritide low dose dopamine patient congestive heart failure kidney dysfunction . There substudy subset subject use determine whether Provocative Dyspnea Severity Score ( pDSS ) sensitive index variability clinical status dyspnea VAS assess without standardization condition assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute heart failure ( AHF ) common cause hospital admission patient age 65 , account 1,000,000 admission , 6 million hospital day , $ 12 billion cost annually . The prognosis patient admit AHF dismal , 20-30 % readmission rate 20-30 % mortality rate within six month admission . Recent study establish prognostic importance renal function patient heart failure . In patient hospitalize decompensated congestive heart failure , worsen renal function also associate bad outcome , Various study estimate 25-30 % patient hospitalize decompensated CHF worsen renal function lead prolonged hospitalization , increase morbidity mortality . Although FDA approve renal adjuvant therapy AHF , several novel adjuvant therapy use AHF investigate randomized clinical trial . Additionally , currently available strategy , potential improve renal function AHF low dose dopamine low dose nesiritide . However , strategy investigate . Participation study last 6 month . All potential participant undergo initial screening , wil include medical history , physical exam , blood draw , measurement fluid intake output , questionnaire . The evaluation procedure repeat various point study . Eligible participant randomly assign receive low dose nesiritide placebo optimal diuretic dosing low dose dopamine placebo optimal diuretic dosing . Follow-up assessment occur Baseline , 24 hour , 48 hour , 72 hour , day 7 discharge , day 60 6 month . Follow-up assessment include medical history , physical exam , blood draw , measurement fluid intake output , questionnaires question medication change health . The RED ROSE substudy involve subset ROSE patient look dyspnea assessment . The dyspnea visual analog scale ( dyspnea VAS ) suggest superior ordinal ( Likert ) scale assessment dyspnea acute heart failure syndrome ( AHFS ) 1 . However , standardization condition ( oxygen supplementation , position , activity ) time VAS assessment thus , may optimally reflect variability dyspnea severity AHFS patient . This insensitivity variability baseline subsequent assessment may limit ability reflect variation response time alternate treatment strategy . A standardized sequentially provocative assessment dyspnea ( provocative dyspnea severity score , pDSS ) may better reflect variation dyspnea severity variation response time alternate treatment strategy . Substudy subject ask complete provocative dyspnea assessment baseline , 24 , 48 72 hour . The subject ask complete 6 minute walk assessment 72 hour visit .</detailed_description>
