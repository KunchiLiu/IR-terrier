	<brief_summary>This study seek investigate role pimecrolimus restore disturbed skin barrier function reverse epidermal abnormality find atopic dermatitis ( AD ) . The project base finding investigator present recent SID meeting Providence publish J Invest Dermatol ( 122 : 1423-31 , 2004 ) . The investigator research show AD characterize impaired skin barrier function , reduce stratum corneum hydration , impaired epidermal lipid composition epidermal differentiation . In proposed project , investigator wish examine influence pimecrolimus betamethasone valerate transepidermal water loss ( TEWL ) marker skin barrier function , stratum corneum hydration , stratum corneum lipid content epidermal differentiation regard keratin cornified envelope protein AD patient . The study involve biophysical measurement TEWL skin hydration , lipid analysis , immuno-histochemistry , Western blot micro array technique . This study shall clarify whether pimecrolimus restores epidermal barrier whether contributes beneficial effect pimecrolimus AD . Objectives : To explore stratum corneum hydration , transepidermal water loss , capacity barrier repair integrity stratum corneum patient treat 1 % pimecrolimus cream apply twice day atopic dermatitis upper limb , access substance 's influence epidermis histological , ultra-structural , biochemical analysis use punch biopsy day 1 one arm day 22 treat arm . 0.1 % betamethasone valerate cream b.i.d use control treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects may include follow apply baseline visit ( day 0 , first application study medication ) . Patients include : Males female race . &gt; = 18 year old . Have atopic dermatitis define Hanifin Rajka criterion . History mild moderate atopic dermatitis At least 10 % upper limb affect atopic dermatitis exclude surface area hand , treat order avoid crosscontamination . As reference : one hand ( palm finger ) correspond 10 % patient 's upper limb surface . One specific , representative area disease upper limb similar size severity upper limb . These consider target lesion . A target lesion score least 3 8 ( scale 012 ) right leave target lesion differ 1 score point right leave side . able suspended treatment atopic dermatitis therapy duration study ( 46 week ) . Must inform study procedure sign informed consent form approve study . Females : Who pregnant breastfeed . Who menstruate , capable become pregnant practice medically approve method contraception . `` Medically approve '' contraceptive may , discretion investigator , include abstinence . ( If patient oral contraceptive , must begin treatment least one month prior baseline continue least four week last treatment ) . Other therapies/medications : Prior phototherapy systemic therapy know suspected effect atopic dermatitis within 14 day prior first application study medication . Patients low stable dose inhaled steroid ( dose know negligible systemic absorption ) systemic antihistamine may participate . Topical therapy know suspected effect atopic dermatitis ( include topical steroid , topical tacrolimus ointment topical pimecrolimus cream ) upper limb within 7 day prior first application study medication . Topical therapy know suspected effect atopic dermatitis area upper limbs total body surface treat high 20 % ( due high risk systemic absorption affect lesion upper limb ) within 7 day prior first application study medication Concurrent diseases / condition history diseases / condition : Patients sign skin atrophy corticoid damage target area Patients immunocompromised ( e.g . lymphoma , AIDS , WiskottAldrich Syndrome ) Patients concurrent skin disease ( e.g . impetigo ) near study area could interfere study evaluation Patients acute viral skin infection ( e.g . herpes simplex , varicella zoster ) Investigational drug / therapy use . Patients use investigational drug within 8 week prior first application study medication intend use investigational drug course study Ingredient hypersensitivity Patients know hypersensitivity ingredient study medication ( see technical information sheet ) Compliance / reliability / investigator judgment Patients , opinion investigator , know unreliable noncompliant medical treatment , know miss appointment ( accord patient record ) Patients drug abuse problem , mental dysfunction factor limit ability cooperate fully Patients condition prior/present treatment , opinion investigator , render patient ineligible study</criteria>
