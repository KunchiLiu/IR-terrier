Participants complete daily diary collect first morning urine specimens allow identification menstrual cycle . Thus woman time pregnancy prospectively measure . We intend trace woman ask complete questionnaire include recall time pregnancy study . This allow u address two major question , one regard recall time-to-pregnancy , regard natural length gestation . In addition , investigate association bisphenal A ( BPA ) , phthalate metabolite , 2,4- 2,5-dichlorophenols , Triclosan , benzophenone-3 , methyl- , propyl- butyl-parabens reproductive outcome . This described separate section end protocol involve recontacting participant , assay store urine sample purpose within goal original study . 1 . Recall time-to-pregnancy Time pregnancy commonly study estimate fecundability . This outcome use study reproductive effect environmental toxin , cigarette smoking , obesity numerous exposure . Prospective study time pregnancy require enrollment woman start attempt pregnancy follow pregnancy conceive . This type study time-consuming costly . It also difficult identify population woman begin attempt pregnancy . A efficient design ask woman recall time pregnancy . This design limit however , unknown well woman recall time pregnancy . Only two study examine question population prospective retrospectively recalled time pregnancy . One study involve woman Netherlands , recall period short ( 3-20 month ) , part woman time pregnancy prospectively observe . The second study longer recall period ( 1-10 year ) include 43 woman . 2 . Length gestation Gestational length time conception delivery . The EPS good data first data point , know date delivery . However , data delivery limited fact know delivery induce product natural onset labor delivery . We plan collect information mother . Such information allow u consider natural variability gestational age ( measure exist present ) also estimate association event early pregnancy subsequent duration pregnancy . The EPS detail measurement time ovulation implantation , rate increase human chorionic gonadotropin corpus luteum rescue . To knowledge , early pregnancy characteristic investigated association length gestation .</detailed_description>
