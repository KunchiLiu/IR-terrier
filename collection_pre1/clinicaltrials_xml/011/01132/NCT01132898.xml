	<brief_summary>Background : - Traumatic brain injury may range effect , severe permanent disability subtle functional cognitive deficit often go undetected initial treatment . To improve treatment therapy provide uniform quality care , researcher interested develop standardized criterion diagnose classify different type traumatic brain injury . By identify image indicator immediately injury initial treatment phrase , researcher hope good understand nature effect acute traumatic brain injury . Objectives : - To study natural history traumatic brain injury examine change brain scan , blood sample , brain function 5 year injury . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 70 year age traumatic brain injury within past 6 month . Design : - This study include eight visit NIH Clinical Center 5 year . Participants four visit first year , one visit year follow 4 year . Each visit take 1 4 day , participant outpatient clinic 8 hour day visit . - At study visit , participant follow test : - Medical history physical examination - Blood urine test - Questionnaires assessment think memory , may speak aloud , write , enter computer - Imaging scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) . - This study provide treatment replace current therapy . However , participant eligible National Institutes Health study may refer study researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The primary objective contribute understand non-penetrating traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) description relationship neuroimaging , hematological , extensive functional/cognitive phenotyping measure . We generate natural history data cohort-based comparison serve basis future hypothesis-driven protocol . In addition , create test series new taxonomy describe TBI severity predict outcome . Study Population Three hundred adult subject clinical diagnosis non-penetrating TBI ( mild , moderate severe ) enrol . Subjects recruit NIH , affiliate hospitals/clinics , community . Additionally , fifty adult healthy volunteer without history TBI see comparison . Design This natural history study follow prospective cohort subject clinical diagnosis non-penetrating acute traumatic brain injury cross-sectional sub-study . Subjects enrol prospective cohort within one year head injury follow periodically five year , neuroimaging , include Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography ( PET-CT ) , hematological , extensive functional/cognitive phenotyping measure . Subjects enrol cross-sectional sub-study within five year head injury evaluate MRI , hematological , functional/cognitive measure within single visit . Subjects stratify accord finding cohort comparison . Subjects treat experimental therapy part research study . This study provide direct benefit subject receive sensitive neuro-imaging clinical test diagnostic value would ordinarily provide community . In addition TBI patient group , longitudinal control group comprise healthy volunteer collect . The control group participant may complete Neuroimaging ( MRI without gadolinium ) , hematological functional/cognitive phenotyping measure TBI patient population . Outcome Measures A variety outcome measure use include MRI , include Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) , Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast ( DSC ) , functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , high field 7T MRI PET-MR . In addition , extensive sensitive clinical phenotyping perform assess functional cognitive impairment , quality life assessment . Blood saliva ( buccal cell may collect lieu whole blood subject unwilling unable provide blood draw ) may also collect sent biorepository future analysis subject agree participation sample collection .</detailed_description>
