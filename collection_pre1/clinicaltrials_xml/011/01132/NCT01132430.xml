	<brief_summary>The high burden asthma appear related poor asthma control , associate frequent asthma symptom , great bronchodilator use functional impairment , bad pulmonary function . Despite availability effective treatment , 58 % asthmatic poorly control . Daily adherence inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) regimens consider expert one important behavioral factor link achieve optimal asthma control . However , paucity research intervention specifically design improve ICS adherence among adult asthmatic . The vast majority intervention study date use atheoretical intervention target behavior change , rely mainly upon educational approach criticise `` fail translate knowledge action . '' This may due fact education-based approach specifically address help patient overcome ambivalence behavior change , necessary ensure daily adherence . Motivational interviewing ( MI ) client-centred intervention focus enhance intrinsic motivation change particular behavior , explore resolve ambivalence behavior change . Brief MI session ( e.g. , 1-5 x 15-30 minute session ) show improve variety health behavior ( e.g. , reduce alcohol consumption , improve dietary habit , increase exercise behaviour , improve medication adherence ) health outcome ( reduce blood pressure , body mass index , cholesterol level ) . However , study date assess efficacy use MI improve ICS adherence asthmatic . This study aim assess efficacy use MI improve daily medication ( ICS ) adherence sample poorly control , non-adherent asthmatic . It hypothesize patient randomize MI condition exhibit significantly improve ICS adherence 6 12-months post-intervention , independent baseline level covariates , relative patient randomize usual care control condition .</brief_summary>
