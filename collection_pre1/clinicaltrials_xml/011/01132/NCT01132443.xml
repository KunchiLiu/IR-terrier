	<brief_title>W0261-101 : A Phase 1 , Single Center , Randomized , Open-Label Study Evaluate Bioavailability Clindamycin From Clindamycin 1 % -Benzoyl Peroxide 3 % Gel , Topical Gel ( Clindamycin 1 % - Benzoyl Peroxide 5 % ) , Once Daily Gel ( Clindamycin 1 % -Benzoyl Peroxide 5 % ) Subjects With Acne</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clindamycin benzoyl peroxide ( BPO ) well-known treatment acne vulgaris ( acne ) available single-entity fixed-dose combination product . The excipients use gel vehicle formulation , except inclusion preservative methylparaben vehicle dependent geographic region . While product show well tolerate , effective combination therapy acne , concentration-dependent cutaneous irritation associate use BPO . Clindamycin 1 % -benzoyl peroxide 3 % gel ( CLN 1 % -BPO 3 % ) topical treatment acne develop . CLN 1 % -BPO 3 % contain concentration clindamycin low concentration BPO currently-marketed product , CLN 1 % -BPO 3 % formulate without methylparaben . A study evaluate plasma concentration clindamycin metabolite topical gel apply daily 4 week subject moderate-to-severe acne show absorption clindamycin metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide comparable Topical Gel representative single entity product clindamycin concentration . An vitro skin penetration study demonstrate significant difference delivery clindamycin skin follow application either CLN 1 % -BPO 3 % topical gel ; therefore , presence BPO formulation either 3 % 5 % effect percutaneous absorption clindamycin . Benzoyl peroxide show absorbed skin convert benzoic acid . Following topical application , le 2 % dose enters systemic circulation benzoic acid . The transepidermal delivery BPO dependent concentration systemic toxicity expect due rapid renal clearance benzoic acid . Benzoic acid frequently utilized preservative adjust pH food , cosmetic , medicinal product ; therefore , limited systemic absorption CLN 1 % -BPO 3 % expect notably increase exposure benzoic acid . Due low potential systemic toxicity limited utility assess plasma concentration benzoic acid , systemic exposure evaluate study . Systemic exposure clindamycin associate severe case diarrhea , bloody diarrhea colitis ( include pseudomembranous colitis ) , could fatal . Several study conduct single-entity fixed-combination topical clindamycin-containing product determine systemic absorption clindamycin low ; however , documented case colitis topical administration clindamycin phosphate . Clindamycin phosphate rapidly hydrolyze vivo clindamycin , active parent compound . Topical application Clindagel ( clindamycin phosphate 1 % gel ) equivalent 3 12 gram daily 5 day result peak plasma clindamycin concentration less 5.5ng/mL . Multiple topical application Cleocin T ( clindamycin phosphate concentration equivalent 10mg/mL ) result clindamycin serum level range 0 3 ng/mL . The mean systemic bioavailability clindamycin le 1 % . As exists potential different topical formulation great systemic exposure active ingredient currently market product , study conduct determine bioavailability clindamycin metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide alter concentration BPO absence methylparaben . This study compare investigational study product 2 marketed product : - CLN 1 % -BPO 3 % Gel ( clindamycin 1 % -BPO 3 % ) , methylparaben-free - Topical Gel ( clindamycin 1 % -BPO 5 % ) , methylparaben-preserved ( Topical Gel-MP ) - Once Daily Gel ( ( clindamycin 1 % -BPO 5 % ) , methylparaben-free ( Topical Gel-MPF )</detailed_description>
