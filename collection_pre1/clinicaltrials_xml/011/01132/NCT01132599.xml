	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) imaging , may help find diagnose metastatic prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect C-11 choline 18F-fluoromethylcholine see well work use PET CT image patient metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing PET-CT Using C-11 Choline 18F-Fluoromethylcholine Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare C-11 choline 18F-fluoromethylcholine use positron emission tomography compute tomography image ability detect metastatic prostate cancer . - To compare best early-phase ( immediate ) scan two agent late-phase ( one-hour delay ) 18F-fluoromethylcholine scan ability detect metastatic prostate cancer . - To assess safety C-11 choline 18F-fluoromethylcholine patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive C-11 choline IV follow 10-minute dynamic positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan pelvis 5-minute scan bed position , pelvis base skull , ( maximum 7 additional bed position ) last 45 minute day 1 . Beginning 3 hour later , patient receive 18F-fluoromethylcholine IV follow scan protocol last approximately 45 minute . An additional 1-hour delay PET-computed tomography ( CT ) scanning perform , involve 5-minute scan bed position pelvis base skull ( maximum 7 bed position ) 18F-fluoromethylcholine , last approximately 35 minute . Patients undergo treatment per normal standard care follow participation trial . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3-7 day .
