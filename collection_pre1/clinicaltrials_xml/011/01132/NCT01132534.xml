	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Comparing Autofluorescence Imaging ( AFI ) Followed Narrow Band Imaging ( NBI ) With Videoendoscopy Detection High Risk Lesions Stomach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer remain one leading cause cancer death worldwide . Early detection diagnosis gastric cancer improve outcomes treatment . However , gastric cancer detect Singapore late advance stage . Videoendoscopy standard tool examination gastrointestinal tract . Despite improvement technology , early gastric cancer easily miss routine examination , morphological change . Therefore , functional imaging modality , distinguish abnormal lesion surround normal mucosa may complement current videoendoscopy . Autofluorescence Imaging ( AFI ) base presence natural tissue fluorescence gastrointestinal tract . When mucosa expose excitation light , certain endogenous molecule ( fluorophores ) emit fluorescence light longer wavelength . The fluorescent light detect spectrally analyze . By computation difference reflect image , system specify lesion , include malignancy adjacent mucosa , reveal early cancer detectable standard endoscopy . Narrow band imaging ( NBI ) another novel optical imaging technique base high resolution imaging , aim enhance fine structure mucosa . In NBI , band width red , blue , green component excitation light narrow certain wavelength range , allow good contrast superficial mucosa vascular structure . NBI maximum zoom capacity 115 time . Abnormal lesion detect presence abnormal mucosal vascular pattern . Recent study suggest AFI NBI system complementary . The resolution AFI low use 'red flag ' technique screen suspicious lesion normal mucosa . On hand , NBI produce high resolution image allow detailed examination subsequent target biopsy suspicious lesion base AFI . Preliminary report Japan Netherlands suggest combined image method improve detection early esophageal gastric cancer . Recently , new endoscopy system develop incorporates standard videoendoscopy system AFI NBI mode . By press switch , endoscopy system switch normal white light either narrow band light autofluorescence mode . This novel system reduces convenience discomfort patient avoid repeat intubation . The purpose study prospectively evaluate combine image modality detection high risk gastric lesion early cancer compare standard videoendoscopy randomize fashion .</detailed_description>
