	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood laboratory patient receive chemotherapy may help doctor learn effect chemotherapy cell . It may also help doctor understand patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study study biomarkers related thrombosis patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Related Thrombosis Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To measure level circulate tissue factor ( TF ) patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma several time point , , administration chemotherapy and/or antiangiogenic agent . Secondary - To measure correlation TF two marker coagulation activation ( i.e. , D-dimer , thrombin-antithrombin [ TAT ] complex ) two marker endothelial activation ( i.e. , soluble E-selectin , soluble thrombomodulin ) patient . - To measure compare ( descriptively ) microparticle-associated TF procoagulant activity assay two assay use sample patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically treatment . Circulating tissue factor ( TF ) activity level coagulation endothelial activation ( ELISA ) measure . Medical chart review sociodemographic medical information . After completion study , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
