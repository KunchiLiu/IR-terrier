	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) patient either persistent recurrent endometrial carcinoma . II . To determine frequency degree toxicity cediranib assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v. ) 4.0 cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . II . To estimate probability response without restriction duration response documentation since study enrollment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response cediranib correlate high-expression receptor target ( e.g. , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [ VEGFR ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] platelet derive growth factor receptor [ PDGFR ] ) . II . To determine response cediranib correlate high endogenous circulate plasma level VEGFA , low-levels endogenous inhibitor , soluble fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ( sFlt-1 ) ( truncate , circulate portion VEGFR-1 ) , circulate tissue factor ( TF ) circulate prostate apoptosis response-4 ( Par-4 ) , potential marker tumor progression . III . To determine high-expression VEGFA pre-treatment tumor specimen correlate response cediranib . IV . To determine expression phosphorylated mitogen activate protein kinase ( ERK ) 1 2 , c-Jun , signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( Stat3 ) , protein kinase C ( PKC ) , phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 ( p70S6 ) kinase correlate resistance sensitivity cediranib . OUTLINE : Patients receive cediranib maleate orally ( PO ) daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
