	<brief_summary>Allergic rhinitis asthma common respiratory disease , often coexist . The prevalence allergic rhinitis subject asthma 80 % , prevalence asthma 3-5 time great subject rhinitis healthy control . The mechanisms allergen response diseases parallel , similar mediator cellular response similar allergen . These observation lead suggestion disease different expression one airway disease.We wish evaluate effect low dose theophylline patient asthma , give effect subtherapeutic concentration propensity develop adverse event higher dos .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The disease modify treatment asthma rhinitis mirror . The first line therapy topical corticosteroid , good evidence superiority therapy . They work alter transcription gene involve inflammatory process , thereby favourably influence synthesis inflammatory proteins cytokine . They show reduce number inflammatory cell inflammatory action . Other disease modify therapy anti-IgE antibody improve allergic symptom asthma rhinitis . Theophylline use many year treatment asthma use help patient rhinitis . Theophylline consider weak bronchodilator many year . However relatively recently , show anti-inflammatory effect patient asthma . It reduce eosinophil count eosinophilic cationic protein ( ECP ) concentration induce sputum asthmatic patient . The combination low dose theophylline great effect lung function asthma severity high dose inhale corticosteroid . Aubier el al show , use nasal allergen challenge model rhinitis , 3 week treatment slow release oral theophylline reduce increase concentration eosinophilic cationic protein ( ECP ) percentage eosinophils nasal lavage follow challenge . Furthermore significant reduction nasal symptoms patient treated theophylline . However theophylline previously evaluate therapeutic option patient chronic rhinitis clinic setting . Cigarette smoke major cause morbidity patient asthma show independently associate impaired quality life asthmatic child . Recent evidence suggest patient asthma smoke relatively resistant inhaled oral corticosteroid therapy , large dos require clinical benefit . The actual mechanism observation unknown however one hypothesis smoking effect histone deacetylase . It known theophylline active histone deacetylase therefore improve efficacy corticosteroid . Theophylline cause significant adverse effect high dos . Unfortunately bronchodilator effect occur dos close cause adverse effect . This low therapeutic index bronchodilation mean therapeutic monitoring require . However anti-inflammatory effect theophylline effect theophylline histone deacetylase activity occur concentration lower therapeutic level bronchodilation . Why choose dose 200mg twice daily ? In study Evans et al compare low dose inhale budesonide plus theophylline high dose inhale budesonide , great effect theophylline combination see term pulmonary function hyperresponsiveness serum concentration theophylline sub therapeutic ( 8.7mg/ml ) . Anti-inflammatory effect see patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease theophylline concentration subtherapeutic . There study patient asthma show anti-inflammatory effect patient asthma dose 250mg twice daily 200mg twice daily . We wish therefore evaluate effect low dose theophylline patient asthma , give effect subtherapeutic concentration propensity develop adverse event higher dos .</detailed_description>
