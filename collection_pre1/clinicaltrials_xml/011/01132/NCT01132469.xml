	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Early Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traditionally open-gastrectomy standard treatment gastric cancer without distant metastasis , high mortality morbidity , intense weight loss , food intake difficulty surgery fraught , include problem drawback significantly degrade quality life . Therefore , lot effort seek simple treatment open gastrectomy make , recently endoscopic treatment early gastric cancer widely use treatment . This single-arm , multi-center study enroll early gastric cancer patient ESD compare retrospective control ( surgical treatment ) group consider unreality randomize clinical trial . In addition , quality life assessment EORTC C30/STO22 tool ESD procedure enrol patient perform direct cost analysis also conduct .</detailed_description>
