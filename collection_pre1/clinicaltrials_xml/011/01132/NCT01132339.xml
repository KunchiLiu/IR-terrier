	<brief_summary>Rationale : Contrast agent important tool MR/CT- examination , come diagnose disease . But despite frequent use Denmark , free serious potentially fatal adverse reaction . Examples contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) . Therefore , extremely important clarify adverse reaction actually directly relate use contrast agent MR/CT- examination . Objective : To prospectively assess incidence adverse reaction iodine-containing CT gadolinium- base MR contrast agent prospective design . A control group examine without use contrast agent include , study illuminate report adverse event relate contrast agent CT/MR- examination . This project long term mean , significant life-threatening delayed adverse reaction discover early hence likely treat patient good time adverse reaction . The following series hypothesis investigate study : 1 . Renal well non-renal adverse reaction occur relate use contrast agent MR-/CT-examination . 2 . CIN occur patient undergo MR-/CT-examination contrast agent . Methods : Approvals obtain The Copenhagen County Committee Biomedical Research Ethics Danish Data Protection Agency . A total 1600 patient include Department Radiology Herlev Hospital , MR- CT examination perform . Patients divide four group ( , b , c ) 400 patient group . Group c ( case group ) undergo respectively MR CT examination contrast agent While group b ( control group ) undergo respectively MR CT examination without use contrast agent . For patient follow record : Risk factor , renal function ( eGFR ) 72 hour MR/CT- examination well incidence immediate reaction ( within 30 min. ) . Furthermore , patient answer questionnaire 72 hour 1 month MR/CT- examination severity frequency adverse reaction contrast medium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale objective : Contrast agent continue cause concern among patient doctor widespread use rare potentially important adverse reaction associate . Intravenous ( vein ) contrast agent use daily Computed Tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) examination aid detection characterization disease . Despite use million examination year , contrast agent entirely free serious potentially life-threatening adverse reaction . Therefore , application iodine-containing gadolinium-based contrast agent , respectively CT MR- examination raise safety concern , especially patient certain risk group , e.g . patient previous allergic reaction gadolinium iodine-containing contrast agent , patient pre-existing renal impairment diabetes patient . Adverse reaction contrast agent divide non-renal renal adverse reaction . The non-renal adverse reaction may acute delayed . The acute adverse reaction occur within one hour contrast agent administer patient , delayed adverse reaction occur one hour within week.Some reaction Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) may occur even later classify late adverse reaction . Patients high risk group identify contrast agent administration avoid adverse reaction . Adverse reaction use iodine-containing contrast agent know 20 year . They mostly mild moderate skin reaction occur period 1 hour 7 day contrast agent administration , usually disappear within 3-7 day . Nevertheless , serious life-threatening adverse reaction occur , one serious effect Contrast Induced Nephropathy ( CIN ) , renal adverse reaction . CIN refers reduction renal function induce contrast agent . This imply deterioration renal function ( increase serum creatinine 25 % 44Î¼mol / L ) occur within three day intravascular administration iodine-containing contrast agent . CIN well know complication come radiological study use iodine-containing contrast agent . The rapid development frequent use CT- examination simultaneous administration relatively large dos iodine-containing contrast agent contribute grow number case CIN recent year . For many year , gadolinium-based contrast agent consider safe , 2006 first report patient develop new rare potentially fatal disease call NSF week exposure gadolinium-based contrast agent begin . However , 2006 NSF link gadolinium contrast agent propose free gadolinium contrast agent could trigger NSF . NSF connective tissue disease usually manifest skin disease swell arm leg , also affect internal organ . NSF occur combination chronic kidney disease recently particularly investigate . Therefore , essential clarify reaction actually directly related application contrast agent MR/CT-examinations . Most major study conduct gadolinium-based iodine-containing contrast agent retrospective , far similar large scale study perform independently pharmaceutical company . Thus , lack independent study , investigate severity adverse reaction well delayed adverse reaction one month patient expose contrast agent.The study aim investigate safety profile respectively iodine-containing gadolinium-based contrast agent CT MR- examination prospective design . A control group examine without use contrast agent include , study illuminate report adverse reaction relate contrast agent CT/MR-examinations . This apply renal , non-renal , late adverse reaction . This project ultimately illuminate significant life-threatening late effect therefore , detect earlier , become likely treat patient good time event . The following series hypothesis investigate study : 1 . Renal well non-renal adverse reaction occur relate use contrast agent MR-/CT-examination . 2 . CIN occur patient undergo MR-/CT-examination contrast agent . Methods : Approvals The Copenhagen County Committee Biomedical Research Ethics The Danish Data Protection Agency obtain . The study conduct prospective study Herlev Hospital , Department Radiology . Patients refer MR/CT-examination offer participation study . Since patient refer MR-/CT-examination part patient diagnostic evaluation , distribution different group without influence study officials.The study include total 1600 patient period approximately 2 year . The patient distribute four group ( , b , c ) 400 patient group . Group c ( case group ) undergo respectively MR- CT- examination respectively gadolinium-based contrast agent iodine-containing contrast agent . Group b ( control group ) undergo MR/CT-examination without use contrast agent . Informed consent obtain patient . Data collect continuously . For participate patient follow register : risk factor ( patient allergic gadolinium-based iodine-containing contrast agent , patient renal impairment diabetes ) , estimate kidney function ( eGFR ) finger stick blood test immediately 72 hour MR/CT-examination . The blood test quick , easy require small stick side finger tip finger stick . The blood drop place test strip renal function meter , whereupon eGFR read . The test strip destroy immediately completion test/ measurement . To detect occurrence acute adverse reaction administration contrast agent , patient observe 30 min . Patients control group also observe 30 minute start MR/CT-examination . All patient supply two questionnaire regard occurrence adverse reaction possible delayed reaction , must complete 72 hour one month MR/CT-examination . Results group compare result group b , result group c compare result group d. This study statistically randomize , since observational study . Furthermore , necessary major control group . Adverse reaction , risk disadvantage : There know adverse reaction study , exclusion criterion meet . Patients already refer MR/CT- examination , contrast agent already approve health authority use tools MR/CT-examinations . Therefore , study pose great risk inconvenience participant . Moreover , adverse reaction associate blood test measurement . Economic condition : Study official financial tie private firm pharmaceutical company interest study . Since majority research contrast agent make pharmaceutical company , project important great interest since independent pharmaceutical industry . Therefore , project 's conclusion influence strategic economic interest . Ethical consideration : This study unique sense far , major prospective study follow patient one month completion MR/CT-examination . The study primarily intend method clarify extent late adverse reaction may occur patient left examination room . For precisely contrast agent , advantageous study provide comprehensive systematic overview acute late adverse reaction , many severe life-threatening late adverse reaction occur day even week contrast agent administration . We hope study result improve documentation whether incidence acute delay severe adverse reaction directly relate use contrast agent MR/CT-examinations . This increase patient safety ; help clarify whether adverse reaction relate contrast agent MR/CT-examination . For individual participant benefit participation study mean , future significant delay adverse reaction discover time . Furthermore , detection presence mild or/and moderate adverse reaction lead , earlier treatment adverse reaction .</detailed_description>
