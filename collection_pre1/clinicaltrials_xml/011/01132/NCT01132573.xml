	<brief_title>Entinostat Clofarabine Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed , Relapsed , Refractory Poor-Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Bilineage/Biphenotypic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility , tolerability , toxicity , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) entinostat plus clofarabine : adult patient age 40 newly diagnose , poor-risk Philadelphia chromosome negative ( Ph- ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) bilineage/biphenotypic leukemia ( ABL ) prior traditional cyclical multi-agent chemotherapy , adult age 21 relapse refractory ALL/ABL . II . To determine entinostat plus clofarabine induce clinical response adult newly diagnose , poor-risk ALL/ABL adult relapsed/refractory ALL/ABL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) entinostat alone combination clofarabine . II . To obtain descriptive preliminary pharmacodynamic ( PD ) data regard effect entinostat alone combination clofarabine histone acetylation global gene specific methylation leukemic blast . III . To obtain descriptive preliminary data regard effect entinostat alone combination clofarabine deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage apoptosis leukemic blast residual disease monitor 6-color flow cytometry . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study entinostat . Patients receive entinostat orally ( PO ) day 1 8 clofarabine intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 3-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( patient least 60 year age newly diagnose ALL ABL unable unwilling tolerate standard multi-agent chemotherapy patient relapse refractory ALL ABL ) . Patients 40-59 year age newly diagnose ALL receive standard multi-agent induction chemotherapy begin day 11 . Patients least 21 year age first relapse sensitive disease begin initiation allogeneic transplant one course entinostat clofarabine . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 , 360 day .</detailed_description>
