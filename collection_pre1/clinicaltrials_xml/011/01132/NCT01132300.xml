	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Initial evaluation clinical effectiveness Image Guided Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation ( TENS ) device treatment non-specific low back pain . - To assess tolerability acceptability device caregiver ( `` User Friendly '' ) . - To evaluate patient ' tolerance monitoring side effect tolerability treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Image Guided , Auto-Targeted Neurostimulation Treatment Non-Specific Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) device drug-free alternative managing pain . For past thirty year , doctor prescribe FDA approve TENS worldwide effective way relieve pain . TENS device currently utilized include variety type device pulse modulation . Most device apply large surface area , design block pain signal ( gate mechanism ) brain . Others manual TENS device apply small surface area stimulate peripheral nerve end , cause release endorphins significantly superior clinical outcome . Such treatment time consume cumbersome require previous knowledge location nerve end . A novel device capable scan large skin surface area , automatically locate nerve end responsible pain relief utilizing skin impedance measurement image process anatomical matching test stimulating peripheral nerve end ( NeMa-st , Nervomatrix Ltd. , Netanya , Israel ) . For purpose open study initially evaluate safety efficacy intervention design . 20 patient undergo 2 treatment session per week period 4 week , maintain pain relief medication treatment regime .</detailed_description>
