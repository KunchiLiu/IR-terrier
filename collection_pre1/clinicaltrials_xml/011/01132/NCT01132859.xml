	<brief_summary>Background : - The Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) dedicate understand immune response associate prevention treatment infectious disease . To study immune response , researcher need collect specimen image individual recently vaccination recover infection . These specimen image use study different disease immune response , use investigate way prevent treat different medical condition . Objectives : - To evaluate blood tissue sample immune response vaccine natural infection . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age agree donate specimen research purpose . Design : - Participants clinical evaluation ask provide follow sample , depend research question address . All procedure sample donation optional voluntary : - Blood sample regular blood draw ( whole blood ) apheresis ( collect specific part blood plasma white blood cell ) - Urine , semen , saliva , vaginal swab sample - Tissue sample biopsy specimens - Undergo procedure bronchoscopy ( lung respiratory tract ) , gastrointestinal endoscopy ( stomach upper intestinal tract ) , colonoscopy ( low intestinal tract ) obtain tissue sample - Undergo image study positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan Duration participation variable depend research question usually last 1 year . - Participants compensate participation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VRC 900 : Evaluation Tissue-Specific Immune Responses Adults 18 Years Age Older</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Design : This specimen , image data collection protocol design purpose understand immune response vaccine infection adult subject collection tissue specimens medical history data , radiographic imaging . The information gain enhance knowledge immune correlate protection help laboratory work relate development validation immunological assay . This protocol allow Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) investigator collaborator evaluate tissue level immune response subject recipient Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -licensed vaccine , recipient VRC clinical trial vaccine , control subject , naturally infected subject examples naturally acquire immunity . Immune response evaluate use blood , body fluid , mucosal tissue sample , radiographic image clinical evaluation . The underlying hypothesis protocol detailed study immune response blood diversity tissue type , include variety mucosal surface , understand immune response follow vaccination recovery infectious disease advance development vaccine exist , new , re-emerging pathogen . Subjects : Volunteers 18 year age old agree donate specimen research purpose enrol . A maximum 500 subject enrol protocol . Study Plan : Subjects receive information study procedure , willing participate , sign study inform consent . FDA-licensed vaccine may administer study subject part study participation . As per NIH Clinical Center ( CC ) policy , appropriate , subject provide additional informed consent study procedure . Duration : Individual subject may donate sample often permit protocol NIH CC guideline . The CC guidance volume blood drawn inpatient/outpatient procedure follow . The protocol undergo continue review Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) annually .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 year age old . Able provide proof identity satisfaction study clinician complete enrollment process . Able willing complete inform consent process . Willing donate specimen storage use research genetic test perform research purpose . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnancy breast feed Any medical , psychiatric , occupational condition condition , judgment investigator , contraindication protocol participation impairs subject ability give inform consent . Bleeding disorder diagnose doctor ( e.g. , factor deficiency , coagulopathy , platelet disorder require special precaution ) , use anticoagulant medication ongoing medical condition , significant bruise bleed difficulty IM injection blood draw . [ Note : Subjects take anticoagulant , aspirin , prophylactically may consider case case basis . ]</criteria>
