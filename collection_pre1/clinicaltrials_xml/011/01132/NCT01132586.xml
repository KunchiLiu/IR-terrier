	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together cytarabine idarubicin treat patient acute myeloid leukemia . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine idarubicin , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lenalidomide together cytarabine idarubicin may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combination conventional chemotherapy two separate cohort patient 1 ) relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) 2 ) age &gt; = 60 untreated AML recommend start dos phase II study combination agent . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define qualitative quantitative toxicity combination agent regard organ specificity , time course , predictability , reversibility . II . To document therapeutic response combination agent patient poor risk AML . III . To conduct pharmacodynamic study investigate potential mechanism lenalidomide activity trial . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . INDUCTION : COHORT I : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously 96 hour day 5-8 , idarubicin IV 1 hour day 5-7 . COHORT II : Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 , cytarabine IV continuously 24 hour day 5-11 , idarubicin . Patients residual disease day 18 undergo second course induction therapy . CONSOLIDATION : COHORT I : Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD day 1-14 , idarubicin IV 1 hour day 5-6 , cytarabine IV continuously day 5-7 . Treatment continue 1 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT II : Patients 2 receive 4 course consolidation therapy comprise lenalidomide PO QD day 1-14 cytarabine IV every 12 hour day 5 , 7 , 9 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
