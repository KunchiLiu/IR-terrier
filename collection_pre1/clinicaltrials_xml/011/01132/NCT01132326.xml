	<brief_summary>Symptomatic NOH patient primary autonomic failure think consequence norepinephrine depletion lead diminish capacity effect appropriate cardiovascular response orthostatic challenge result symptomatic cerebral-hypoperfusion . Droxidopa augments norepinephrine level lead improve cerebral perfusion follow orthostatic challenge thereby reduce symptom NOH . The present study evaluate long-term safety droxidopa .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Droxidopa Patients With Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension ( NOH ) ( Droxi-304 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , multi-center , open-label study design evaluate long-term safety droxidopa subject neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( NOH ) associate Primary Autonomic Failure , Dopamine Beta Hydroxylase Deficiency Non-Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy . Patients initially treat droxidopa individualize dose identify titration phase Protocol 301 . Patients require adjustment dose , unless physician feel dose change benefit symptom , side effect . At point study patient 's physician may elect titrate subject high low dose feel additional benefit safely derive deal unwanted side-effect . Patients return clinic study visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month ( ± 1 week allow 1 month visit , ± 2 week allow subsequent study visit ) . Patients prematurely withdraw study ask attend study center final assessment At conclusion 12 month treatment period , patient benefit treatment droxidopa offer option continue receive open-label droxidopa separate access program . At time study , patient schedule visit study physician experience worsen symptom wish dose adjust remove trial . Patients decide terminate participation study receive phone call 1 month leave trial follow-up new ongoing adverse event ( AEs ) . It recognize best practice patient neurogenic orthostatic hypotension advise lay fully supine associate increased risk supine hypertension inherent condition . Patients participate study advise sleep semi-recumbent position . . Patients attend study center out-patients . Patients identify use unique identification number assign Protocol 301 .</detailed_description>
