	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) reduce insulin resistance non-diabetic subject rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . The investigator conduct double-blind randomize crossover trial subject RA test hypothesis HCQ improve insulin sensitivity . The investigator also use data trial identify determinant insulin resistance RA . The investigator hypothesize RA associate increase risk insulin resistance independent risk factor increase insulin resistance RA include high BMI , elevate acute phase reactant , great fat muscle ratio , less physical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our ability well control pain disability rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) focus attention reduce impact RA-associated comorbidities . The common cause death RA cardiovascular ( CV ) disease , risk myocardial infarction stroke approximately doubled RA . The determinant CV risk RA include traditional CV risk factor well aspects inflammatory process define RA . It likely RA-associated inflammation accelerate atherosclerosis direct effect endothelium well indirect effect insulin metabolism . Several study report increase prevalence insulin resistance among person RA . However , clear whether inflammation RA cause insulin resistance . Corticosteroids abnormalities hypothalamic-pituitary axis may also contribute abnormal glucose metabolism . Little information available guide management pre-diabetic insulin resistance state RA . Hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , commonly use medicine early RA , may play role improve insulin resistance . Several previous trial demonstrate ability HCQ reduce blood glucose level diabetic , large epidemiologic study find subject RA use HCQ less likely develop diabetes . In animal model , anti-malarials low blood glucose slow insulin metabolism . With CV disease major comorbidity RA insulin resistance possibly major determinant CV risk , intervention study need begin translate prior work clinical therapeutic . Relevance : If study demonstrate beneficial effect HCQ insulin resistance among randomized subject , would provide strong evidence HCQ benefit beyond RA SLE disease activity . Currently , HCQ stop many patient `` step-up '' aggressive DMARD treatment , HCQ may never try patient present RA carry poor prognosis . If HCQ improve insulin sensitivity , may rationale continue HCQ chronically patient RA . As well , large clinical endpoint study would strongly consider .</detailed_description>
