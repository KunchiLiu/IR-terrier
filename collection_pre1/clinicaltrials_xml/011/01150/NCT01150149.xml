	<brief_summary>Most country world , include USA make preparation possible influenza pandemic . Such event constitute global public health emergency , impossible predict happen . Up 80 million people could die worldwide , much possible need do advance find way impact reduce . Although investigator know medical intervention anti-influenza drug antibiotic important , even well resourced country might short supply . Vaccines also important available least 4-5 month pandemic start . This mean non-pharmaceutical measure could well important social distancing , school closure use face mask . Guidance also need developed family care whilst minimize spread infection . To thing , investigator need know influenza transmit person-to person . This poorly understood present . The investigator also need know face mask work recommendation public use make . The best way study influenza transmission effectiveness mask perform study use healthy adult volunteer . The investigator give volunteer normal influenza via nasal drop . When get symptom investigator create 'experimental household ' get live non-infected volunteer 48 hour , specially design quarantine isolation unit . Some non-infected volunteer unprotected ; others select randomly wear either face mask special plastic 'cloak ' touch face ; another group wear . The investigator measure rate different group get 'flu ' . From data investigator work whether touch face cough sneeze spread flu whether important ; investigator also deduce well face mask work prevent spread . The investigator need almost 2000 volunteer study , take least 2 year complete costly , however , result global importance . If study successful , investigator tell government around world whether face mask work prevent influenza clearer guidance give family .</brief_summary>

Willingness provide write consent participation read Subject Information Sheet Informed Consent Form adequate opportunity discus study Investigator qualify deputy . H3N2 antibody titre level record &lt; 1:10 Good general health status determine screen evaluation great 160 day prior quarantine challenge phase . Subjects shall register general practitioner confirm subject ' past medical history suitability participate base . Consent obtain receive information . For female subject , provision history reliable contraceptive practice [ hysterectomy bilateral tubal ligation , oral implant contraceptive use , intrauterine device , barrier method plus spermicide , history single male partner vasectomy documentary evidence confirm sterility ( negative sperm count recommend postoperative interval ) history abstinence deem credible Investigator ] . The provision history NOT replace requirement perform , obtain negative result , pregnancy test . Presence significant acute chronic , uncontrolled medical psychiatric illness , include exclusive condition list Appendix 7 , view Investigator associate increase risk complication respiratory viral illness [ subject uncomplicated chronic diagnosis stable treat 3 month ( e.g . mild hypertension wellcontrolled medication may enrol ) provide condition therapy know associate immunocompromised state increase risk complication respiratory viral illness ] . Health care worker ( include doctor , nurse , medical student ally healthcare professional ) anticipate patient contact within two week viral challenge . Healthcare worker volunteer work patient 14 day challenge symptom fully resolve ( whichever longer ) . Health care worker work unit housing severely immunocompromised patient ( e.g . bone marrow transplant unit ) exclude study . Venous access deem inadequate phlebotomy demand study . Positive serologic test HIV , Hepatitis B surface antigen , Hepatitis C antibody . Evidence drug abuse positive urine Class A drug alcohol screen . Female subject , know pregnant positive urine pregnancy test prior challenge . Acute ( within 7 day challenge/exposure ) chronic use medication product ( prescription overthecounter ) , symptoms rhinitis nasal congestion nasopharyngeal complaint , use intranasal medication indication ( include corticosteroid beta agonist contain nasal spray ) . Any history adulthood asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease condition require bronchodilator therapy . A history childhood asthma include age 12 acceptable . Smokers unwilling/unable desist quarantine phase duration study smoker &gt; 10 pack year history smoking . A nicotine test do study specific screen must negative prior admission quarantine unit . Subjects type I type II Diabetes Mellitus . Body Mass Index &gt; 30 . An Abnormal ECG deem clinically relevant Investigator . Any anatomic neurologic abnormality impair gag reflex conducive aspiration , history suggestive problem abnormality significantly alter anatomy nose nasopharynx . Receipt systemic glucocorticoid ( dose 5 mg prednisone daily equivalent ) within one month , cytotoxic immunosuppressive drug within six month prior challenge . Receipt investigational drug within 6 month prior challenge , prior participation clinical trial Influenza vaccine , investigational vaccine experimental Influenza viral challenge deliver directly respiratory tract within 1 year prior challenge . History adverse reaction neuraminidase inhibitor e.g . oseltamivir Presence febrile illness symptom upper viral respiratory infection : . On day challenge/exposure admission Influenza challenge/exposure administration challenge inoculum ( Donors ) exposure event ( Recipients ) . Such subject may reevaluate enrollment later study resolution illness ; ii . Within 2 week prior challenge challenge set occur November , December , January , February , March symptoms suggestive viral respiratory infection occur screen challenge .
