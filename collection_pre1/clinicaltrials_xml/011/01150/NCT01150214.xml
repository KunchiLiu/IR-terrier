	<brief_summary>This multi-center , observational , 1-year prospective cohort study ( 1 year follow-up , 3 , 6 12 month ) approximately 675 participant . We conduct thorough outcome assessment utilize data Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan , well pre-procedure follow-up data . Scans blind location participate site . MRI scan sequence analyzed arrive database . Imaging Protocol : All patient undergo Delayed-Enhancement MRI ( DE-MRI ) within 30 day prior atrial fibrillation ( AF ) ablation procedure . The purpose initial MRI quantify degree atrial structural remodel fibrosis pre-ablation . Following ablation , DE-MRI obtain 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up detect quantify ablation-related scar formation . Clinical Follow-up : The institution ablation perform continue post-procedural care follow standard care procedure . Atrial arrhythmia recurrence catalogue one year post-ablation predictor recurrence AF determine statistical analysis . The specific mechanism electrophysiological characteristic atrial arrhythmia recurrence also analyze . Our hypothesis ( 1 ) DE-MRI reproducibly stage progression leave atrium fibrosis AF ; ( 2 ) DE-MRI reproducibly aid quantify identify distribution catheter ablation-related scarring leave atrium ; ( 3 ) stage leave atrium fibrosis pre-ablation amount location scar predict success catheter ablation therapy AF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) electrophysiological condition characterize disorganized electrical activity atrium heart . AF associate structural heart disease include hypertension , systolic diastolic ventricular dysfunction valvular heart disease . It represent significant public health problem increase longevity general population . A major determinant progression AF structural remodel fibrosis occur left atrium . A extensively remodeled atrium represent substrate need arrhythmia persist . Structural remodel also major determinant success rhythm control strategies AF . While catheter ablation reproducibly show superior anti-arrhythmic drug therapy rhythm control AF , success procedure significantly affect extent structural remodel present time catheter ablation . Delayed-Enhancement Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DE-MRI ) demonstrate effective modality identify fibrotic scarred cardiac tissue excellent correlation autopsy finding . This related characteristic Gadolinium , extracellular contrast agent effective identifying region fibrotic non-viable myocardium . DE-MRI technology powerful , non-invasive method , identify extent distribution structural remodel fibrosis associate AF . Applying DE-MRI technology atrium cause significant technical challenge . The atrial wall often millimeters thick require high spatial resolution obtain adequate useful image . In addition , image acquisition gate diastolic phase atrial contraction cycle , may difficult patient AF . The ongoing research University Utah show significant progress promise result overcome challenge mention . Specific image acquisition sequence allow reproducible identification high pixel intensity region within 2-dimensional image atrial wall . Three-dimensional reconstruction entire leave atrium provide quantification overall volume occupy hyper-enhanced region relative entire leave atrial wall volume . Used prior catheter ablation , DE-MRI therefore identify region significant structural remodel fibrosis . The technology also show useful examine amount distribution ablation relate scarring . Clinical patient characteristic collect study clinic visit chart review . Imaging Protocol : All patient undergo DE-MRI within 30 day prior AF ablation procedure use DE-MRI protocol . The purpose initial MRI quantify degree atrial structural remodel fibrosis pre-ablation . Following ablation , DE-MRI obtain 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up detect quantify ablation-related scar formation ( Figs . 4-5 ) . Clinical Follow-up : The institution ablation perform continue post-procedural care follow standard care procedure . Monitoring definition atrial arrhythmia AF recurrence guide HRS consensus document ablation atrial fibrillation . Clinical MRI data store use IRB-approved University Utah database . De-identified clinical data MRI image participate institution also submit database , process University Utah pre- post-ablation fibrosis scar quantification . The ablation strategy utilized procedural endpoint leave discretion operator participate site . This data also collect include final analysis . MRI image processor University Utah blind ablation technique mother institution use unique de-identified study participant ID number . Atrial arrhythmia recurrence catalogue one year post-ablation predictor recurrence determine multivariate/survival analysis . The specific mechanism electrophysiological characteristic atrial arrhythmia recurrence also analyze .</detailed_description>
