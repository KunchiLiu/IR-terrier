	<brief_title>Paired Marrow Aspirations Assess Assays Sensitized Renal Allograft Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim risk protocol determine variability AlloElispot Allospecificities assay . Our group develop two novel assay determine : 1 ) number donor-specific alloantibody ( DSA ) secrete bone marrow derive plasma cell ( AlloELISPOT assay ) ; 2 ) function DSA-secreting Plasma cell ( Allospecificities assay ) . These assay develop past 3 year already provide important mean test new therapeutic protocol aim control DSA production . It important note repeat attempt isolate PCs peripheral blood unsuccessful ( PCs extremely rare peripheral blood ) bone marrow accessible source PCs . It clear reach point must validate assay ( coefficient variation , etc ) , order appropriately evaluate data derive assay . Inter-assay variability assess perform two paired assay patient . This could do two ways—paired bone marrow aspiration separate time two bone marrow aspiration perform time . We decide pursue latter approach . We marrows either time transplantation subject general anesthesia Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) use conscious sedation.. We believe safe well-tolerated provide data need validate assay .</detailed_description>
