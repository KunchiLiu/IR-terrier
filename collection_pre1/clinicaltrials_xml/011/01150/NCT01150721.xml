	<brief_summary>Background : - Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection respiratory infection sometimes difficult diagnose . Proper diagnosis depend accurate collection respiratory secretion , secretion may contaminate bacteria present mouth time collection . In addition , individual may difficulty provide respiratory secretion , infection affect lung function sputum production . By collect new sample individual already diagnose infection , compare method collection , researcher hope good understand improve ability accurately diagnose treat infection early stage . Objectives : - To compare throat culture coughed-up induced phlegm sputum individual pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection inflammation . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 79 year age diagnose pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection currently participate select NIH protocols infection . Design : - The study require single 90-minute visit provide research specimen . - Participants must eat drink 2 hour prior collection early morning respiratory specimen . Blood pressure , temperature , pulse , breathe rate , oxygen saturation level reading take day collection ensure participant may safely provide specimen . - Participants provide follow sample : - Blood sample : Participants provide blood sample measure indicator inflammation blood . - Throat swab : Participants brush teeth thoroughly allow researcher swab inside throat sterile swab . - Sputum collection ( regular induce ) : Participants brush teeth thoroughly provide regular sputum sample ( produce normally ) induce sputum sample ( produce use nebulizer stimulate sputum production ) . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In protocol , repeat measure design use examine microbial molecular result subject diagnosis pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infection . Patients often experience difficulty spontaneous expectoration sputum free contamination oral flora contributes poor quality respiratory specimens sent laboratory . At present , know induced sputum , expectorate sputum , pharyngeal swab compare acid fast bacillus ( AFB ) smear culture result . Appropriate specimen need clinical set optimum diagnosis . In study , procedures non-invasive collection respiratory secretion use decrease risk specimen contamination . Subjects produce respiratory secretion compare patient successful . It known factor prevent production respiratory secretion test . Airway inflammation may contribute difficulty produce sputum along dyspnea , phase illness ( newly diagnose chronic infection ) , treatment status , respiratory condition severity . Subjects characterize phase illness determine health history inflammation use common laboratory test inflammation . Respiratory specimens blood collect microbial test portion store tested analysis pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha , &amp; IFN-gamma ) . Clinical , demographic , laboratory , patient subjective variable test use regression statistical method determine predictor specimen production success . Clinical variable test include forced expiratory volume one minute ( FEV1 ) pulmonary function test ( PFT ) , phase illness treatment , age . The laboratory test indicate inflammation include erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Beta-2-Microglobulin ( Beta-2M ) . Patient assessment dyspnea evaluate use Borg questionnaire .</detailed_description>

Healthy volunteer must meet follow criterion participate study : Ages 1880 year Healthy Willing blood test CRP , Beta2 M , ESR , cytokine assessment respiratory secretion blood Willing donate respiratory secretion blood use future research EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects PNTM : Inability unwillingness provide specimen : blood respiratory ( subject able provide blood least one type respiratory secretion withdraw study ) Current medication colony stimulate factor , IFNgamma , TNFalpha monoclonal antibody Rituximab within three month study Vital sign fall beyond follow parameter prior specimen collection procedure : 1 . Temperature ( tympanic ) great 101degrees Fahrenheit ( 38.3 degree Celsius ) pulse less 51 per minute great 124 per minute 2 . Respiratory rate le 12 per minute great 40 per minute . 3 . Oxygen saturation le 92 percent New ( less equal 30 day ) tracheostomy tube , chest tube , major surgery . Current infection TB HIV Any condition judgment investigator would place subject risk would jeopardize study . HEALTHY VOLUNTEER PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Inability unwillingness provide specimen : blood respiratory ( subject able provide blood least one type respiratory secretion withdraw study ) 2 . Current use specific biological medication : colony stimulate factor , IFN &gt; = , IFN monoclonal antibody Rituximab within three month study 3 . Vital sign fall beyond follow parameter prior specimen collection procedure : 1 . Temperature ( tympanic ) great 101degrees Fahrenheit ( 38.3 Celsius ) 2 .

Recent ( less equal 30 day ) tracheostomy tube , chest tube , major surgery . 5 . Current infection tuberculosis 6 . History chronic lung disease associate increased inflammation include : asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary fibrosis , lung condition , opinion investigator , may potentially associate increased pulmonary inflammatory response . 7 . Any condition judgment investigator would place subject risk would jeopardize study . Participation Women : Contraception : The protocol requirement contraception restriction due contraception choice study intervention ( blood draw collection respiratory secretion restriction relative contraception ) . Pregnancy : The protocol requirement restriction due pregnancy . Study intervention ( blood draw collection respiratory secretion restriction relative pregnancy . Participation Minorities : There restriction minority participation study . Participation Children : Children include study since benefit versus procedural burden protocol support inclusion . Asking child produce three respiratory specimen protocol visit think burdensome . Infants young child spontaneously expectorate . The main protocol upon protocol recruit include adult .</criteria>
