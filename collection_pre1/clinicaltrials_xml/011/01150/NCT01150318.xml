	<detailed_description>Papillary cancer may affect patient age , good prognosis . Most young patient may hence procreate often general population . 131iodine essential tool treatment thyroid cancer , concern ablation orthotopic thyroid remnant and/or distant metastasis . According literature data , 131iodine give patient may experience exocrine testicular dysfunction transient azoospermia , significant grow number DNA damage may concern patient offspring . No high malformation risk describe child fathered patient receive 131iodine thyroid cancer . But animal study show genomic instability lead major cancer risk offspring male mouse receive isotopic radiotherapy . The deduced hypothesis genetic toxicity radiation exist germ cell , acquire mutation may transmit next generation , major risk somatic mutation accumulation . So described TCHERNOBYL expose patient child . Unfortunately , little known trans-generational genomic instability . The primary outcome study genomic instability within germinal line , base significant mutation rate analysis minisatellite region 100 mCi 131 iodine irradiation compare baseline spermogram patient , thus control case cross-over study . Literature report risk ratio rise 1,4 1,6 comparable exposition dose . Under 2,5 % spontaneous mutation rate hypothesis 1000 minisatellites study per subject , mutation rate rise 50 % ( RR=1,5 ) , inter-individual variability expect high : inclusion 50 patient treat surgery prior to131iodine would result statistically significant result . Secondary outcome look deleterious endpoint spermatogenesis , : apparition low number spermatozoid , low vitality , low mobility , elevate apoptosis aneuploidy rate find sperm treated subject vs iodine treatment . Therefore , kinetics spermogram parameter alteration available . Testosterone/LH ratio assess 131iodine . Direct measure testis irradiation obtain scrotal dosimeter permit calculation deliver irradiation dose dose/effect relation different parameter . This multicentric cross-over study multidisciplinary approach act direct benefit testis function patient age 18-45 treat 131iodine thyroid cancer . Samples measurement timing : surgery , 2 12 month 131iodine administration . Therefore , endpoint medical examination , exocrine endocrine testis function blood spem sample assessed order obtain spermogram , Sperm Cytogram , aneuploidy/apoptosis , minisatellites region mutation rate . Medical examination take place local site , either endocrinology , oncology , nuclear medicine department . The sperm sample spermogram , Sperm Cytogram , irradiation- induced abnormalises study centralize CECOS ( Tenon Hospital , Paris , France ) . Hormonal dosage process Bicetre Hospital ( Kremlin-Bicetre , France ) . Minisatellites mutation study process frozen sperm sample take place Genetic Radiosensibility Department ( Commissionership energy atomic , SACLAY , France ) . This study would permit measure minisatellites region mutation rate frequency , aneuploidy DNA damage frequency , finally kinetics alteration 131iodine irradiation human thyroid cancer . At clinical level , practitioner would precisely advise patient potential fertility risk help choose appropriate practice order preserve thyroid cancer treatment . Knowing result , may redefine iodine indication . The knowledge irradiation-induced genomic abnormalises critical , regard grow number examination ( Computed Tomography Positron Emission Tomography-scans ) , know deliver amount irradiation .</detailed_description>
