	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare 2 experimental vaccine could provide protection disease , tularemia . This research compare ability vaccine cause body develop immune ( protective ) response obtain information side effect vaccine . About 220 male non-pregnant female volunteer 18 45 year participate . Volunteers assign 1 2 vaccine group chance . About half volunteer place DVC-LVS vaccine group half volunteer place USAMRIID-LVS vaccine group . Additionally , group receive injection placebo ( inactive salt water ) . Study procedure include physical exam blood urine sample . Evaluation vaccination site perform well blood sample measure body 's response vaccine . Participants involve study 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Tularemia Vaccine Comparison</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Francisella ( F. ) tularensis organism responsible tularemia . The organism infect many different vertebrate invertebrate host , mostly rodents lagomorph . Transmission human generally via insect vector , tick , mosquito , bite fly , handle contaminate animal product carcass . F. tularensis highly infectious bacterium , human infection disease occur 10 organism , mortality rate approach 30 percent untreated . Clinical presentation tularemia varies severity depend virulence organism , route entry , extent system involvement , immune status host . Following incubation period 3 5 day , individual abrupt onset fever , chill , headache , malaise , anorexia , fatigue . The clinical presentation disease include one follow form : ulceroglandular ( common form disease ) , glandular , oculoglandular , pharyngeal , gastrointestinal , pneumonic typhoidal . This study Phase II , multi-center , double-blind , randomize , trial compare safety immunogenicity Francisella tularensis live vaccine strain ( LVS ) vaccine produce DynPort Vaccine Company ( DVC-LVS ) LVS vaccine use United States Army Medical Research Institute Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID-LVS ) . Study Group A include 110 volunteer vaccinate single dose DVC LVS product one arm normal saline ( NS ) control arm Day 0 . Group B include 110 volunteer vaccinate single dose USAMRIID-LVS product one arm normal saline ( NS ) control arm Day 0 . Both vaccine administer scarification . Approximately 100 microliters aliquot withdrawn place skin , bifurcate needle used puncture skin 15 time droplet . The primary objective : ( Safety ) : assess frequency serious adverse event ( SAEs ) Grade 3 4 laboratory value follow vaccination either DVC-LVS USAMRIID-LVS vaccine ; ( Take ) : assess frequency `` take '' ( define development erythematous papule , vesicle , and/or eschar without underlie induration ) follow vaccination either DVC-LVS USAMRIID-LVS vaccine ; ( Immunogenicity ) : ass rate seroconversion follow vaccination either DVC-LVS USAMRIID-LVS vaccine measure tularemia-specific microagglutination assay . The secondary objective : ( Safety ) : assess incidence adverse event ( AEs ) follow vaccination either DVC-LVS USAMRIID-LVS vaccine ; ( Take ) : assess `` take '' frequency difference vaccine group assess independent committee follow vaccination either DVC-LVS USAMRIID- LVS vaccine ; ( Immunogenicity ) : ass antibody response group follow vaccination DVC-LVS USAMRIID-LVS vaccine measure tularemia-specific microagglutination assay . Parent protocol sub-study 10-0019 .</detailed_description>
