	<brief_summary>Background : - Syringomyelia disorder cyst ( syrinx ) form within spinal cord cause spinal cord injury , symptom worsen many year , include paralysis , loss sensation , chronic pain . Researchers interested obtain knowledge syrinx form order develop safer effective treatment syringomyelia related condition . - The goal surgical treatment syringomyelia eliminate syrinx prevent spinal cord injury . In patient , surgery result syrinx become small , effect surgery patient muscle strength , pain level , overall function study time . In addition , individual syringomyelia relate condition consider good candidate surgery , information need potential alternative treatment individual . - By record 5 year symptom , muscle strength , general level functioning , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan finding individual receive standard treatment syringomyelia , researcher obtain information factor influence development , progression , relief symptom . Objectives : - To conduct 5-year natural history study individual syringomyelia related condition . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age syringomyelia related condition ( include pre-syringomyelia Chiari I malformation without syringomyelia ) . Design : - This study require 7 outpatient visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center : initial visit ; visit 3 month later ; visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 year initial visit . An additional 10 day inpatient treatment test require surgery need study . - The following test perform study : - Medical history physical examination , may also determine eligibility surgery - Detailed neurological history examination - Blood urine sample - MRI scan : Participants 2 scan initial evaluation , 2 scan 3-month visit , 1 scan every year follow 5 year . - Additional neurological imaging test need , include lumbar puncture collect spinal fluid , myelogram ( image study ) spinal fluid , compute tomography scan skull spine . - Participants surgical candidate additional test along surgery , include diagnostic study ( electrocardiogram chest X-ray ) surgery MRI scan 1 week surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Natural History Study Patients With Syringomyelia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE The natural history patient syringomyelia addressed prospective study . Present surgical treatment patient syringomyelia neurologic deficit result disease stabilization many patient , although objective improvement less common . Delayed deterioration uncommon . The natural history patient syringomyelia without neurologic deficit associate lesion also uncertain . By identify factor influence syringomyelia progression affect response surgical treatment , acquire knowledge enable u provide accurate recommendation future patient syringomyelia regard optimal surgical non-surgical treatment condition . STUDY POPULATION This study enroll patient syringomyelia patient risk develop syringomyelia , include patient Chiari I malformation patient presyringomyelia . DESIGN Prospective radiological clinical data collect 5-year period patient syringomyelia patient risk develop syringomyelia . Patients syringomyelia neurological deficit consider surgical candidate . In group , neurologic radiographic outcome patient undergo surgery compare patient refuse surgical treatment . Patients syringomyelia without neurological deficit consider surgical candidate . In group , initial neurologic radiographic finding compare find one year entrance study . Any patient syringomyelia develop progressive neurological deficit offer surgical treatment his/her condition . In study also prospectively collect information process may influence development progression syringomyelia , trauma inflammatory disease . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure change motor strength , measure American Spinal Injury ( ASIA ) Grading Scale , 1 year . The secondary outcome measure change maximal syrinx diameter 1 year surgical candidate ( surgically-treated vs. surgically untreated ) non-surgical candidate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible participate research study , subject must : 1 . Be 18 year age old . 2 . Have syringomyelia , presyringomyelia , Chiari I malformation without syringomyelia . 3 . Be able give inform consent . SPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS THAT MAY UNDERGO SURGERY 1. new increase impairment sensation , strength , walk within previous 2 year ; 2. MRIscan show syrinx presence abnormal fluid swell spinal cord ; abnormality spinal cord must locate part spinal cord could produce patient symptom ; 3. evidence abnormality base skull within spine often associate syringomyelia , abnormality CSF circulation increase pressure cerebrospinal fluid ; 4. medical health sufficient allow subject withstand major surgical procedure remain active recovery period surgery . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject eligible participate research study subject : 1 . Is pregnant ( multiple MRI scan might injure fetus ) . 2 . Can MRI scan determine radiologist ( see risk ) . 3 . Has problem bleeding correct . Note : Prior surgery syringomyelia result exclusion study radiographic evidence recurrent persistent syringomyelia surgery condition ( fail previous surgery ) .</criteria>
