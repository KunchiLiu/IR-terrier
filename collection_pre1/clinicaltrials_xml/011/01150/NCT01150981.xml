	<brief_summary>Insulin resistance common condition lead type 2 diabetes . One commonly prescribe diabetes medication , call rosiglitazone , work decrease insulin resistance . Rosiglitazone appear work fat cell . Animal study suggest rosiglitazone may work increase blood vessel growth fat cell . The purpose research see rosiglitazone also increase blood vessel growth human fat cell . The investigator compare result rosiglitazone 6 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adipocytes play crucial role control metabolic homeostasis , sequester excess calorie form triglyceride , secrete cytokine control systemic fuel utilization . Sustained excess calorie consumption result adipocyte hypertrophy hyperplasia , like expand tissue , require increased capillary expansion nourish enlarge adipose tissue mass . Recent report indicate decrease capillary density adipose tissue obese individual correlate insulin resistance , suggest imbalance angiogenesis adipogenesis may underlie condition . To determine whether improvement insulin sensitivity relate change adipose tissue capillary development , conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine capillary density , angiogenic growth potential , metabolic parameter healthy human volunteer treatment rosiglitazone , potent insulin sensitizer .</detailed_description>
