	<brief_title>A Safety Pharmacokinetic Study Paliperidone Palmitate Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity dose study drug know patient ) , safety pharmacokinetic study high dose ( 150 mg equivalent ) paliperidone palmitate ( refer study drug ) administer intramuscular ( IM ) injection ( injection muscle ) patient schizophrenia . A total least 200 adult patient schizophrenia participate study . The study consist 2 phase : up-to-21-day screening period 53-week open-label treatment period include end study/withdrawal visit . The total duration study approximately 56 week . At screen visit , patient treat antipsychotic medication study entry , medication may continue study except protocol-specified medication permit . If patient receive previous treatment least 2 oral ( mouth ) dose antipsychotic agent risperidone paliperidone 1 dose injectable RISPERDAL CONSTA paliperidone palmitate , undergo 4-day evaluation period receive 6 mg/day oral dose extended-release ( ER ) formulation paliperidone evaluate ability tolerate study drug . Patients able tolerate study drug meet entry criterion study administer single IM injection deltoid muscle ( upper arm ) paliperidone palmitate 150 mg equivalent ( eq ) Day 1 ( Treatment A ) . Patients tolerate Treatment A receive 2nd IM injection deltoid muscle 150 mg eq Day 8 follow 150 mg eq administer IM injection deltoid gluteal ( buttock ) muscle every 4 week remainder 53-week treatment period . Patients tolerate Treatment A wish multiple blood sample collect pharmacokinetic testing assign Treatment B . Patients tolerate Treatment A receive single IM injection study drug 100 mg eq next scheduled visit follow flexible dose schedule study drug range 50 150 mg eq administer IM injection deltoid gluteal muscle every 4 week remainder 53-week treatment period . Blood sample pharmacokinetics ( ie , test concentration study drug blood ) collect specify time dose study drug patient ; additional blood sample pharmacokinetic test collected patient receive Treatment A . An additional blood sample may also collect time screen first day IM administration study drug patient agree participate optional part study call pharmacogenomic evaluation ( genetic testing ) possible use characterize safety and/or efficacy study drug relation pharmacogenic ( genetic ) profile patient . Periodically study , patient assess presence psychiatric symptom severity symptom . The safety tolerability paliperidone evaluate monitoring adverse event ( side effect ) relevant change laboratory value , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign measurement , physical examination , extrapyramidal symptom ( ie , symptom associate take antipsychotic drug ) score report time screen end study ( Day 372 time patient 's early termination study ) . The concentration paliperidone plasma ( colorless portion blood ) blood sample collect Day 1 end study also determine . Since limited information exist regard repeat administration dose paliperidone palmitate , internal review board meet 2 time study review safety data collect . The first review safety data perform approximately 30 patient complete 99 day treatment second review safety data make approximately 75 patient complete 176 day treatment . After review safety data , safety review board make recommendation continue study , modify protocol , terminate study . Patients receive 1 injection deltoid muscle Treatment ( Tx ) A ( study drug 150mg eq ) Day 1 . Patients receive 1 injection deltoid muscle Tx A Day 8 follow 1 injection every 4 week deltoid gluteal muscle OR patient assign Txt B receive 1 injection deltoid gluteal muscle study drug 100mg eq next visit follow 1 injection every 4 week study drug 50 150mg eq deltoid gluteal muscle .</detailed_description>
