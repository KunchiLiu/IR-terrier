	<brief_summary>The central aim study improve understand metabolic pathway contribute adiposity also amplify risk kidney disease progression cardiovascular disease subject moderate severe CKD . In order achieve goal , propose follow aim randomize 2x2 factorial design trial subject moderate severe CKD : ( ) To assess feasibility implement aerobic exercise caloric restriction intervention , ( b ) To examine effect aerobic exercise caloric restriction metabolic risk profile , include systemic measure oxidative stress , inflammation , insulin resistance , endothelial dysfunction . Hypothesis : We hypothesize implementation caloric restriction aerobic exercise feasible improve metabolic milieu ( assessed measure oxidative stress , inflammation , insulin resistance , endothelial dysfunction ) subject moderate severe CKD . Interim analysis may perform ( specific plan time ) .</brief_summary>
