	<brief_summary>Hearing impairment common disorder affect least 7 % individual country . Even cause hear impairment numerous , genetic cause represent main factor sensorineural deafness . Among hereditary non-syndromic deafness autosomal-dominant inheritance observe 10-20 % case . These form deafness usually post-lingual progressive . To date 41 chromosomal localisation 21 gene associate non syndromic dominant deafness describe . It represent extreme genetic heterogeneity make difficult study form hear impairment . But , genetic diagnostic test crucial case . Indeed , therapeutic research way prevent progression disorder . The aim work establish prevalence different gene involve form deafness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The protocol consist first recruitment 150 family non syndromic dominant hearing impairment . The family recruit clinical investigator . The clinic radiological characteristic hear impairment collect clinical investigator . Samples patient healthy relative send referral center . A linkage study whole genome SNP study progress cohort large family affect autosomal dominant deafness . This work enable u select locus may frequently implicate population screen gene 150 family include protocol .</detailed_description>
