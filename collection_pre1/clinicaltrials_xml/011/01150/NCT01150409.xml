	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate potential benefit taper course hydrocortisone compare abrupt cessation patient initiate hydrocortisone septic shock . The study include adult patient medical intensive care unit ( MICU ) meet criterion corticosteroid therapy septic shock accord current MICU protocol.All patient receive 7 day hydrocortisone ( 50mg/Q6hrs ) part routine management septic shock , randomly assign receive hydrocortisone taper versus taper . The primary study endpoint incidence hypotension within 7 day randomization . Secondary endpoint include incidence adrenal insufficiency , change inflammatory status ( assessed cytokine measurement ) , , corticosteroid discontinuation . The cytokine measure include IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-9 , IL-10 , TNF . Since randomized clinical trial investigate potential benefit wean septic patient low-dose hydrocortisone oppose stop abruptly , study potential change clinical practice lead consistent approach corticosteroid discontinuation well understanding impact inflammatory modulation septic shock .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current therapy septic shock include antimicrobial , fluid resuscitation , catecholamine , measure improve tissue oxygen delivery . The use corticosteroid adjunctive treatment septic shock area intensive research past decade . A handful study suggest patient septic shock benefit low-dose glucocorticoids.Low-dose corticosteroid may improve hemodynamics , decrease vasopressor requirement , reduce 28-day mortality patient vasopressor-refractory septic shock . A meta-analysis 2004 also suggest use low-dose corticosteroid significantly increase risk superimposed infection , gastrointestinal bleeding , hyperglycemia . The exact mechanism beneficial effect completely establish , although direct vascular effect anti-inflammatory effect corticosteroid propose . While ongoing debate subpopulation patient derive benefit corticosteroid , much controversy regard appropriate duration therapy . The current Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggest intravenous IV hydrocortisone 200-300mg/day give adult septic shock patient confirm blood pressure poorly responsive fluid resuscitation vasopressor therapy . The duration therapy specify . There also clear evidence suggest patient benefit taper steroid oppose stop abruptly ; strategy employ . Annane show mortality benefit short duration vasopressor therapy abrupt end 7-day course hydrocortisone fludrocortisone patient septic shock compare placebo ; others show similar benefit taper.Keh demonstrate reversal hemodynamic immunologic effect three-day treatment `` low-dose '' hydrocortisone , suggest beneficial effect steroid disappear less 24 hour . Interestingly , 30 % patient restart vasopressor therapy discontinuation corticosteroid one Keh 's study arm .</detailed_description>
