	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) remain single large killer American men woman ( 45 ) . Hyper¬triglyceridemia ( elevate triglyceride [ TG ] concentration blood ) show significant independent risk factor CHD ( 7 ; 8 ; 25 ) , accordingly , treatment hypertriglyceridemia include Adult Treatment Panel III ( ATP III ) National Cholesterol Education Program ( 36 ) . In meta-analysis 21 population-based prospective study include total 65,863 men 11,089 woman , increase 89 mg/dl ( 1 mmol/l ) TG concentration associate 32 % increase CHD risk men 76 % increase woman ( 3 ) . Thus , hypertriglyceridemia even strong risk factor CHD woman men . The prevalence hypertriglyceridemia high . It common find aging , also associate overweight , obesity , diabetes , renal disease ( 39 ) . With age US population ongoing epidemic obesity type 2-diabetes , number individual condition associate elevated TG level likely grow . 4.1.2 Effect Amino Acids Plasma Triglyceride Concentration In effort clarify potential independent effect protein plasma tissue lipid , supplement normal weight-maintaining diet relatively small amount amino acid ( ~90 kcal/day ) meal . We measure tissue lipid addition plasma lipid since increase insulin resistance age link increased fat accumulation muscle liver tissue ( 20 ; 63 ) . Also , repeatedly show amino acid intake stimulates muscle protein synthesis improve muscle protein net balance ( 86 ) . Our hypothesis supplementation normal diet mixture amino acid reduce circulate tissue TG concentration improve insulin sensitivity elderly subject impair glucose tolerance . Twelve impaired glucose tolerant elderly ingest 11 g essential amino acid ( EAA ) + arginine twice day 16 week , 7 week control run . Diet activity otherwise modify . We find individual consume EAA supplement improve physical function . Further , individual low plasma liver TG concentration supplementation , total cholesterol VLDL-cholesterol concentration also low supplementation ( 12 ) . In present study , investigate supplement diet old subject show hypertriglyceridemia .</detailed_description>
