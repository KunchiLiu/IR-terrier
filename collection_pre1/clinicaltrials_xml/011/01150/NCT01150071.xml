	<brief_summary>Background : In national Norwegian cohort child bear 28 week gestation birth weight less 1000 g bear 1999 2000 , 372 survive . Compared early study survival increased immature infant , cost early complication high rate impairment , less immature child few early complication less impairment detectable within 5 year . These change show importance monitoring outcome treatment modality change . Large brain haemorrhage highly predictive severe disability , find good predictive factor milder impairment cognitive , behavioural motor difficulty . However , 5 year later function may difficult predict , child 's potential well understood complete several year school . Objectives : The child re-examined age 11 order ass physical mental health , cognitive , motor social function , determine early life event development 2 5 year predictive long term health function . MRI-studies , include functional MRI perform examine different outcome related brain function explain difference brain development . Methods : For , data collect compulsory national test 5th grade questionnaire child , parent teacher . For child Western Norway ( n=87 ) extensive examination lung brain function , include clinical diagnostic test MRI , add . For aspect study investigator appropriate current historic reference population comparison . Implications : Knowledge cause early prediction outcome need give appropriate advice family , professional society , develop preventive program .</brief_summary>
