Resveratrol polyphenol antioxidant identify 70 specie suggest constituent red wine responsible cardioprotective effect . The potential health benefit resveratrol supplement highly extol alternative medicine industry daily dose 5 gram study . While potential health benefit high dos resveratrol , patient take drug metabolize CYP3A4 , transplant medication , chemotherapy HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor , may clinically significant herb-drug interaction . We , investigator , show vitro resveratrol mechanism-based inhibitor cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) . Based vitro evidence literature report pharmacokinetics resveratrol , hypothesize resveratrol potent vivo mechanism-based inhibitor intestinal CYP3A4 enzyme . To date , clinical study address potential resveratrol-drug interaction . We propose test whether single multiple dos resveratrol alter pharmacokinetics midazolam , prototypic CYP3A4 probe drug .</brief_summary>
