	<detailed_description>Influenza significant cause morbidity mortality United States . Pregnant woman infant increase risk complication influenza . Pregnant woman consider high risk population . In United States , routine vaccination inactivate trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) woman pregnant deliver influenza season recommend . However , study exist safety immunogenicity administration seasonal inactivated TIV . Although influenza vaccination recommend pregnancy , rate immunization remain low , 13 percent , partly reflect concern safety among pregnant woman provider . It important gather prospective data safety immunogenicity inactivate TIV vaccine pregnant woman . This multi-site randomized , double-blinded clinical trial 180 healthy 18-39 year old , pregnant woman second third trimester pregnancy ( 14 week gestation 33 weeks/6 day gestation , inclusive ) 60 healthy 18-39 year old non-pregnant control .

The study begin enrollment least 2 4 study product available . Once enrol , blood sample collect subject receive single 0.5 mL dose assign vaccine . Subjects observe least 15 minute immunization , subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 8 day immunization . Subjects phone call Day 2 8 review memory aid , concomitant medication assessment , assessment AEs . At approximately Day 28 post-vaccination , subject return clinic blood sample collection , AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) . Pregnant subject also schedule phone call Day 28 time delivery Day 180 , whichever later , assess new-onset chronic medical condition , pregnancy-related problem miscarriage serious adverse event ( SAEs ) since last visit . At approximately Day 180 post-vaccination , subject return clinic blood sample collection assessment receipt vaccine since last visit .
