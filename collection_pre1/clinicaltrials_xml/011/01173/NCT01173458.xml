	<brief_title>Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTCs ) Blood-based Tumor Marker Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) characterize early dissemination blood system majority patient succumb disease 9-11 month . Despite evaluation multiple new agent platinum doublet remain standard care 25 year . We believe lack understanding biology SCLC contribute failure advance treatment prolong survival . Tumor blood biomarkers show powerful tool increase understanding complex biology cancer determine prognosis response therapy . Currently , validate biomarkers response follow disease activity SCLC . Detection Circulating Tumor Cells ( CTCs ) laboratory technique become available last decade . Newer , sensitive technology isolation characterization CTCs use rare event image system automate fluorescence microscopy know CellSearch demonstrate value several cancer . CTCs detection system approve prognostic biomarker metastatic breast cancer , tool monitor disease metastatic colorectal cancer castrate resistant prostate cancer . To date , one publication report presence CTCs SCLC . These investigator use RT-PCR amplify CK19 cDNA . CTCs detect 27 % patient . In preliminary study use CellSearch system detect 1 CTCs 11/13 ( 84 % ) patient sample various stage disease . Thus CTCs may promise biomarker need study . Thus , first goal determine CTCs SCLC predict response chemotherapy , predict early relapse function prognostic marker . In addition , explore feasibility extract genetic material CTCs genomic profile could immensely help u unravel complex molecular pathway gene expression SCLC , ultimately lead novel drug development . Other investigator show gene expression profile CTCs may use distinguish normal donor advance cancer patient differentiate among different type cancer . In summary , SCLC kill 45,000 Americans year . The treatment SCLC change since introduction cisplatin etoposide 1970s . Research cancer biology identify several genetic alteration could therapeutic importance . Novel agent target genetic alteration currently development . Patient selection key order determine activity agent . Understanding biology disease key successful intervention personalize therapy .</detailed_description>
