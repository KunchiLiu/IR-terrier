	<brief_summary>The investigator hope learn effect soy nuts marker health . When people eat soy food , gut bacteria make equol . Equol soy metabolite ( small molecule make metabolism ) . The investigator test blood sample determine marker health different people make equol versus people make equol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study investigate metabolomic response consumption soy protein contain polyphenolic phytochemical ( isoflavones ) . The aim pilot study demonstrate proof concept ability detect metabolomic change responsive soy . This preliminary data use design future research project . Food phytochemical polyphenolic flavonoid wide variety food beverage associate cardiovascular protective effect epidemiologic study . Significant controversy exist literature regard efficacy mechanism cardiovascular protection soy food . The soy hypothesis cardiovascular risk reduction focus mainly isoflavone content soy , uncertainty still exist regard bioactive component ( ) . In particular , consumption soy protein food associate favorable cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk profile population base study . Controlled clinical trial meta-analyses however , result conclusion soy protein associate isoflavones modest hypocholesterolemic effect range 3-5 % reduction LDL-cholesterol . Additional cardioprotective effect demonstrate clinical trial , promote small significant change vascular endothelial function antioxidant protection . An important observation animal study show reduction atherosclerotic lesion size without decrease blood lipid level . These result take together suggest soy soy phytochemical promote positive risk factor outcomes mechanisms addition , lower serum cholesterol level . There need great understand cellular molecular mechanism underlie physiologic response isoflavones vascular compartment . Increasing evidence emerge biologically relevant concentration isoflavones may impact cell signal process vascular tissue . The large body literature human clinical trial soy protein isoflavones focus primarily traditional lipid lipoprotein parameter , biomarkers CVD risk , functional change endothelial function , platelet activation total blood antioxidant capacity describe . It possible likely effect soy consumption CVD risk net result multiple subtle change metabolic pathway , vascular inflammatory response cell-signaling pathway readily detect healthy individual . Since individual metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) present many metabolic aberration purport improved soy food ingestion , individual may excellent study population order investigate effect soy food intervention metabolic marker health . Equol end-product daidzein biotransformation , produce human , result phenotypic characteristic response dietary soy . It hypothesize researcher `` equol producer '' may additional metabolic phenotypic response soy may help explain variance literature . Few investigator examine question exist study , two report association outcomes one association . A recent study use microarray analysis lymphocytes postmenopausal woman demonstrate differential gene expression woman form equol compare , suggest equol status may important modulator response soy isoflavones . No study examine question metabolomic investigation . This demonstrate gap literature provide opportunity contribute significant novel data use cutting-edge approach .</detailed_description>
