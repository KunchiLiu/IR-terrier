	<brief_summary>The primary objective study estimate 5 year locoregional control rate External Beam Radiotherapy ( EBRT ) patient locally advance differentiated thyroid cancer . In prior retrospective trial group patient , 5 year locoregional control rate 85 % EBRT group 70 % EBRT group . For total number patient detect minimum 20 % improvement 5 year locoregional control rate 80 % statistical power 5 % significance level , table sample size planning give Makuch Simon chosen . Forty-three patient require regimen regard worthy investigation . Considering 15 % follow loss , 50 eligible patient enrol .</brief_summary>
