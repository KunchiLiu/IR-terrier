	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Pre-hospital cardiac arrest common associate poor prognosis 8 % patient good outcome . For patient initially successfully resuscitate ambulance paramedic transport hospital , considerable mortality morbidity . This largely due anoxic brain injury sustain cardiac arrest . One current therapy severe anoxic brain injury follow out-of-hospital cardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia ( TH ) induce resuscitation . This treatment show improve outcome two clinical trial . The International Liaison Committee Resuscitation recommend TH ( 33°C 12-24 hour ) patient remain comatose resuscitation cardiac arrest . However , optimal timing TH still uncertain . The clinical study use surface cool delay TH arrival hospital . On hand , laboratory data suggest significantly decrease neurological injury cool initiate CPR . The current ideal technique induction TH CPR rapid intravenous infusion large volume ice-cold fluid . This technique become established cool method choice pre-hospital setting , Emergency Department ( 14 ) Intensive Care Unit . Previously , conduct randomise , control trial paramedic cool CPR compare cool emergency department ( ED ) ( NHMRC study number 236879 ) . This study enrol 396 patient 2005 late 2007 . There 234 patient initial cardiac rhythm ventricular fibrillation ( VF ) 163 patient initial cardiac rhythm non-VF ( asystole pulseless electrical activity ) . In post-VF arrest patient , good outcome ( discharge home rehabilitation ) group 50 % . In post-non-VF arrest patient , good outcome hospital discharge 12 % paramedic cool group compare 9 % standard care group . The study stop interim analysis due lack difference primary outcome measure ( outcome hospital discharge ) two group ( futility ) . Further analysis data reveal paramedic infuse 1000mL ambient temperature fluid CPR prior enrolment part standard paramedic treatment . In addition , rapid infusion cold fluid commence en-route hospital . Thus , cool commence approximately 30 minute paramedic arrival prior hospital cooling . Although decrease core temperature patient allocate pre-hospital cooling arrival ED , transient effect last approximately 20 minute . Subsequently , cool curve patient group identical . Thus , consider unlikely transient difference core temperature could measurable effect outcome . Laboratory data suggest rapid intravenous infusion cold fluid CPR effectively decrease core temperature . Nordmark et al . study induction hypothermia large volume intravenous ice-cold fluid cardiac arrest CPR anaesthetise piglet subject eight minute VF . The mean temperature reduction 1.6°C hypothermic group 1.1°C control group ( p=0.009 ) . There also laboratory data cool CPR may increase rate successful defibrillation . Boddicker et al . examined success rate defibrillation swine cool different temperature . After 8 minute VF ( CPR ) , animal defibrillate successive shock need underwent CPR resumption spontaneous circulation response . First-shock defibrillation success high hypothermia ( 33°C ) group ( 6/8 hypothermia versus 1/8 normothermia ; P=0.04 ) . None 8 animal normothermia group achieve resumption spontaneous circulation compare 7/8 moderate hypothermia ( P=0.001 ) . Coronary perfusion pressure CPR different group , thus beneficial effect hypothermia due alteration coronary perfusion pressure likely due change electrophysiological property myocardium . Thus , appear mild hypothermia may beneficial anti-arrhythmic effect , well neuroprotective effect . More recently , pilot clinical trial undertaken Europe suggest cool CPR paramedic feasible . For example , Bruel et al studied feasibility safety rapid infusion 2000mL normal saline 4°C CPR . A total 33 patient include study eight patient present VF initial cardiac rhythm . After intravenous cooling , temperature patient decrease mean 2.1°C . In similar pilot study , Kämäräinen et al . cool seventeen adult patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest CPR . A return circulation achieve 13 patient ( 76 % ) . The temperature patient hospital admission mean 33.8°C mean infused volume cold fluid 1571mL . The author conclude induction therapeutic hypothermia prehospital CPR feasible apparently well tolerate . More recent data specifically examine respiratory function 52 patient treated large volume , ice cold saline indicate adverse effect respiratory function . Given supportive laboratory preliminary clinical data , previous experience run large pre-hospital trial cardiac arrest patient , propose conduct definitive randomize , control trial paramedic cool CPR compare standard care include cool arrival hospital . In treatment arm , paramedic undertake immediate cooling cardiac arrest , use large volume ( 20mL/kg , follow 10mL/kg ) intravenous bolus ice-cold saline . This strategy overcome delay treatment find previous study . Thus , cool commence significantly earlier , possibly result significantly improve rate resuscitation well neurological outcome . In control arm , patient resuscitate use current protocol cool arrival hospital ( current standard care ) . The trial run two parallel clinical trial mark difference outcome patient VF initial cardiac rhythm patient non-VF initial cardiac rhythm . STUDY DETAILS HYPOTHESIS : That paramedic core cooling CPR use rapid infusion ice-cold ( 4 degree C ) large volume ( 30mL/kg total ) normal saline improve outcome hospital discharge compare standard care patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
