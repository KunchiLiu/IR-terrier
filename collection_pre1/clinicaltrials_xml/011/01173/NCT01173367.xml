	<detailed_description>The impact fever management different medical surgical population critically ill patient explain date . Clinical trial critically ill surgical patient demonstrate null potentially harmful effect treatment moderate degree fever . However , pathophysiological effect fever treatment well define accord different patient population , clinical trial result questionably generalize medical ICU patient . This may relate different mechanism fever population merit investigation . There also little know exact time expression diverse pro anti-inflammatory mediator involve inducing , maintain eventually abrogate fever response . Treating sole basis elevate temperature may lead detrimental effect anti-inflammatory cascade naturally regulate response active , demonstrate importance understand normal pattern regulation diverse mediator . The current study aim ass safety efficacy treatment critically ill patient permissive versus aggressive fever treatment strategy . In addition , effect anti-pyretic therapy marker inflammation neurologically intact critically ill adult evaluate . The study population neurologically intact febrile adult ( ≥18 year ) admit Peter Lougheed Center ( PLC ) Foothills Medical Center ( FMC ) ICU 12-month period Calgary , Alberta , Canada . Consenting patient fulfill enrolment criterion randomly allocate either permissive aggressive treatment group ( see Interventions section detail ) . Randomization conceal use consecutively number seal opaque envelope technique . Samples blood collect study patient enrolment subsequently 12 , 24 48 hour assessment inflammatory mediator . Markers feasibility include rate enrolment , adherence patient assign treatment regimen/protocol violation , acceptance protocol staff , facility maintenance random allocation technique . Markers safety include potential adverse event 28-day survival , nosocomial infection rate , evidence myocardial ischemia , hepatocellular inflammation febrile episode .</detailed_description>
