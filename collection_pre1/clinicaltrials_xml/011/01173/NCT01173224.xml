	<brief_summary>Influenza ( flu ) common respiratory infection often cause severe illness . Few drug currently approve treat influenza . This research test safety experimental anti-influenza drug call DAS181 give inhaler . The purpose study evaluate safety new medication body reacts . Any side effect measure symptom , physical examination laboratory study . About 27 healthy men woman age 18-45 , meet screening requirement , participate . Three separate group enrol , approximately 9 subject group . Cohort 1:20 mg DAS181 placebo 1 day ( total dose 20 mg ) . Cohort 2 : 20 mg DAS181 placebo 10 consecutive day ( total dose 200 mg ) . Cohort 3 : 30 mg DAS 181 placebo 1 day ( total dose 30 mg. ) Procedures include blood sample , electrocardiogram ( measure heart activity ) breathing test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza typically cause infection two type virus , influenza virus A influenza virus B . The host cell receptor influenza A B virus cell surface sialic acid ( SA ) . The Actinomyces viscosus sialidase Catalytic Domain ( AvCD ) sialidase domain DAS181 selectively cleave sialic acid host cell , thereby render inaccessible influenza viral particle require sialic acid receptor . By bind negatively charge glycosaminoglycans surface airway epithelial cell , cationic C-terminal Amphiregulin ( AR ) tag anchor DAS181 respiratory epithelium , thereby improve treatment potency retention investigational drug airway surface . DAS181 first candidate new class influenza therapeutic , viral receptor inactivator . The primary objective determine safety tolerability DAS181 encapsulate dry powder compare placebo administer oral inhalation use dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) healthy adult . The secondary objective study investigate pharmacokinetic immunologic profile DAS181 encapsulate dry powder dose dose compare placebo administer oral inhalation use DPI healthy adult . A total 27 normal healthy male female subject ( 9 per cohort ) 18 45 year age time screen include study . This study double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study three cohort . Cohort 1:20 mg DAS181 placebo 1 day ( total dose 20 mg ) . Cohort 2 : 20 mg DAS181 placebo 10 consecutive day ( total dose 200 mg ) . Cohort 3 : 30 mg DAS 181 placebo 1 day ( total dose 30 mg. ) The study proceed next stage multiple daily dos base meeting study define criterion . Within dose cohort nine , subject randomly assign DAS181 placebo 2:1 ratio . Subjects admit inpatient clinic day prior first dose ( Day -1 ) . The subject single dose cohort ( Cohort 1 3 ) stay inpatient unit dosing ( Day 0 ) one day dosing ( Day 1 ) . Subjects Cohort 1 come back follow-up visit Study Days 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 30 . Subjects Cohort 3 return Days 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 . 10 , 16 , 30 . The subject 10-day , multiple-dose cohort ( Cohort 2 ) stay inpatient clinic Day -1 1 require come back follow-up visit Days 2 - 7 . They see ( optionally readmitted ) Days 8 - 10 see outpatient Days 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 27 . All subject ask return additional blood draw conduct immunogenicity test 90 day post final dosing . Subjects train proper inhalation technique prior dose use low range inspiratory flow measurement device .</detailed_description>
