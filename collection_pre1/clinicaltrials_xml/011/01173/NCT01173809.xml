	<brief_title>Effect Amiodarone Procedure Outcome Long-standing Persistent Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Pulmonary Vein Antral Isolation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) prevalent sustain clinical arrhythmia encounter clinical practice . Its prevalence 0.4-1 % general population great 8 % individual &gt; 80 year age . An estimated 2.5million individual North America 4.5 million Europe affect AF ( 1 ) . There two fundamental principle management AF ; 1 ) anticoagulation reduce risk thromboembolism , 2 ) ablation therapy drug control arrhythmia ( 2 ) . Amiodarone , potent antiarrhythmic drug , recommend atrial ventricular arrhythmia . It combination Beta-blockade , calcium- , sodium- potassium-channel blockade effect . Most importantly , potassium-channel blockade slow repolarization , cause increase action-potential duration refractoriness cardiac musculature ( 3 ) . As myocardium remain unresponsive , premature depolarization previously cause AF prevent propagation . During ablation procedure , map electrograms use circular mapping catheter provocative maneuver administration isoproterenol incremental dos commonly use aid identification pulmonary vein ( PV ) non-PV trigger . In addition , area complex fractionate atrial electrograms ( CFAE ) identify eliminate ablation . In patient LSP , inclusion PV non-PV trigger ablation target , improve procedure outcome . As Amiodarone increase refractoriness myocardium , possible effect Amiodarone focal trigger could mask remain unidentified map isoproterenol-provocation . These unrecognized trigger could cause recurrence AF post-ablation period . In word , discontinuation Amiodarone least 5-months ablation could result unmasking focal trigger would otherwise stay unrecognized eliminate trigger would significantly improve success rate procedure . Our study aim investigate role Amiodarone influencing procedure outcome LSP-AF patient undergoing catheter ablation . Hypothesis : Withdrawal Amiodarone 4 month procedure result unmask additional focal trigger , ablation lead improved procedure outcome LSP_AF patient . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . History LSP AF 2 . Age &gt; 18 year 3 . Willing ability understand sign inform consent 4 . Patients chronic Amiodarone therapy ( ≥ 3 month ) Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Unstable angina 2 . Concomitant treatment class I III antiarrhythmic drug 3 . Myocardial infarction within past 3 month ) 4 . Presence disease likely shorten life expectancy &lt; 1 year 5 . Symptomatic heart failure , NYHA III IV 6 . Contraindications Amiodarone 7 . Chronic liver diseases 8 . Pregnant breast-feeding mother Primary Outcome Measure : Recurrence AF , atrial flutter atrial tachycardia Secondary Outcome Measures : Difference occurrence relapse control study group Study design : This multi-center , prospective study consecutively enrol patient treat Amiodarone long stand persistent AF randomize either study control group . Study group : Amiodarone therapy stop least 4-months ablation procedure ablation perform Amiodarone . Patients take Amiodarone blanking period ( 8 week post-ablation ) . Control group : Patient continue take Amiodarone , ablation ( 8 week post-ablation ) . After blank period , everybody would Amiodarone unless recurrence . Anti-arrhythmic drug Amiodarone would try patient develops recurrence repeat ablation would consider . Follow-Up : Patients follow 3 year post-ablation . An ECG telemetry transmission monitor report obtain patient follow-up examination . Patients supply Event Recorder trans-telephonic rhythm transmission ( telemetry ) 5 month ablation , ask transmit rhythm data every time symptom compatible arrhythmia ; least week , even asymptomatic . Holter monitoring perform 6-month post-ablation . The arrhythmic episode document base ECG , Holter data , Event Recorder data and/or implanted device data ( available ) . In case recurrence , patient undergo repeat ablation , procedure happen amiodarone . After redo , patient follow 1 year recurrence way describe .</detailed_description>
