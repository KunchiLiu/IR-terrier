	<brief_title>Ablation Perimitral Flutter Following Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation : Impact Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : In recent year , catheter ablation accept treatment-of-choice drug-refractory atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . It center around isolate pulmonary vein ( PVs ) success rate cure AF high ( 56 % -85 % ) ( 1 ) . However , despite isolation dominant source trigger , recurrent tachyarrhythmia major complication procedure peri-mitral atrial flutter ( PMFL ) common macro-reentrant arrhythmia context AF ablation ( 2 ) . These often drug-refractory arrhythmia frequently associate severe symptom original AF ( 3 ) warrant necessity redo-ablation . This study aim compare impact two different redo-ablation strategy procedure outcome ; ( 1 ) ablation perimitral flutter ( 2 ) cardioversion repeat isolation pulmonary vein ( PV ) ablation additional trigger . Study method : A total number 65 AF patient present redo-ablation PMFL randomize perimitral flutter ablation cardioversion re-isolation ( PVI ) plus ablation additional trigger . Additional trigger identify help post-ablation drug provocation isoproterenol . Patients enter follow-up period 12 month ablation procedure , monitor recurrence arrhythmia detect either in-clinic remote device interrogation 1 , 3 , 6 12 month post-procedure .</detailed_description>
