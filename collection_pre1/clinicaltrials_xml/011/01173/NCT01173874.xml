	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW &amp; SPECIFIC AIMS Marked cognitive impairment underlies much social &amp; occupational dysfunction associate schizophrenia . Currently available antipsychotic medication primarily effective treat psychotic symptom &amp; demonstrate limited potential ameliorate cognitive deficit schizophrenia patient . Lurasidone novel compound synthesize SEPRACOR , Inc.for treatment patient schizophrenia &amp; bipolar disorder . It possess high affinity dopamine D2 , serotonin 5-HT2A , 5-HT7 , 5-HT1A &amp; noradrenaline α2C receptor . Compared atypical antipsychotic , lurasidone demonstrate similar bind affinity D2 &amp; 5-HT2A receptor , great affinity serotonin 5-HT1A receptor . Lurasidone display affinity histamine H1 acetylcholine M1 receptor . In animal study , lurasidone significantly reverse memory impairment induce MK-801 , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , rat step-through type passive avoidance task . The maximum inhibitory effect lurasidone great observed risperidone , quetiapine , &amp; olanzapine , aripiprazole effective reverse impairment induce MK-801 . Additionally , lurasidone significantly reverse memory impairment induce anticholinergic drug scopolamine passive avoidance task . The reversal pharmacologically induce cognitive deficit rat lurasidone promising &amp; warrant specific investigation subject schizophrenia , give prominence cognitive deficit disorder . From different therapeutic perspective , utility cognitive remediation ameliorate cognitive deficit &amp; improve functional outcome schizophrenia recently evaluate several study . A meta-analysis trial find effect size improvement cognitive &amp; psychosocial functioning low moderate range ( McGurck 2007 ) . The best outcomes psychosocial function evident cognitive remediation combine teach psychosocial skill . Given recalcitrant nature cognitive deficit schizophrenia &amp; impact functional capacity felt design study test effectiveness cognitive remediation maximize likelihood therapeutic benefit administer cognitive remediation context pharmacotherapy may potential precognitive effect . By could possibly boost effect size see cognitive remediation alone . In study transition patient schizophrenia ( change antipsychotic therapy clinically warrant ) current antipsychotic lurasidone - clinician eight week complete switch . Subjects successfully switch lurasidone randomize receive either cognitive remediation non-specific mental activity control condition two times/week total 30 session 4-6 month period . Our goal 140 patient complete cognitive remediation phase . A subset sample participate 2 biomarker study . Event related potential &amp; fMRI do subject baseline &amp; study completion . This study do Investigator initiated trial ( J. Lieberman , M.D . - PI ) separate IND . Primary Aim : We hypothesize cognitive remediation superior active control group change baseline study end point cognitive remediation phase co-primary outcome measure ( standardize composite MATRICS score &amp; Cognitive Assessment Interview ) . Additional aim 1 . To compare cognitive remediation active control functional outcome assess change UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment ( UPSA-Brief ) baseline end point cognitive remediation phase . 2 . To compare cognitive remediation active control change lurasidone stabilize baseline end point index functional brain activation ( ERP &amp; fMRI ) cognitive activation task . 3 . Evaluate effect 8 week lurasidone treatment cognitive &amp; functional outcome assess change baseline MATRICS composite score , CAI , &amp; UPSA-Brief . 4 . Evaluate effect cognitive remediation compare nonspecific mental activity cognitive &amp; functional outcome assess change lurasidone stabilize baseline end cognitive remediation phase MATRICS composite score , CAI , &amp; UPSA-Brief . 5 . Evaluate efficacy , safety , &amp; tolerability lurasidone patient schizophrenia assessed change baseline week 8 &amp; end cognitive remediation phase PANSS total score , Side Effect Checklist , AIMS , SAS , BAS , &amp; frequency abnormal laboratory value . BACKGROUND &amp; SIGNIFICANCE A broad range neurocognitive abnormality characterize patient schizophrenia . These include impairment attention ( include abnormality sensory gate ) , visual &amp; verbal learning &amp; memory , work memory , process speed , social cognition , &amp; executive function , ( Nuechterlein et al , 2004 ) , &amp; major determinant poor functional outcome ( Green , 1996 ; Green et al , 2004 ) . Conventional antipsychotic limited effect impairment . Second generation antipsychotic may modest benefit cognitive function although recent literature support advantage first generation antipsychotic ( Davidson et al , 2009 ) . Regardless , patient continue exhibit pronounced cognitive impairment despite adequate antipsychotic treatment &amp; deficit result much social &amp; occupational dysfunction associate schizophrenia . A number investigation examine impact cognitive remediation cognition schizophrenia subject . A recent meta-analysis cognitive remediation trial ( McGurck et al . 2007 ) find low moderate effect size improvement cognitive performance ( effect size 0.41 ) , &amp; psychosocial functioning ( effect size 0.36 ) . Interestingly , effect cognitive remediation psychosocial functioning significantly great study provide adjunctive psychiatric rehabilitation ( effect size 0.47 ) provide cognitive remediation alone ( effect size 0.05 ) . In word , basic cognition-enhancing strategy combine teach psychosocial skill &amp; strategy see clinically meaningful effect psychosocial functioning ( ultimate goal cognitive remediation intervention ) . Of cognitive deficit schizophrenia , verbal learning &amp; memory among abnormal . Abnormalities present early stage auditory processing evidence abnormally low amplitude mismatch negativity response obtain pre-attentive detection auditory stimulus . Reduced mismatch negativity responses significantly associate impaired verbal memory , inability decode semantic &amp; emotional aspect speech , &amp; poor functional status . These finding suggest efficient auditory process crucial successful encode &amp; retrieval verbal information &amp; disturbance elemental process relate higher-order cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia ( Fisher et al 2009 ) . Based body evidence &amp; data animal experiment basic neuroscience learning-induced neuroplasticity , cognitive training program target early auditory process &amp; work memory operation develop Posit Science goal improve verbal memory performance patient schizophrenia . Interim finding ongoing study evaluate effectiveness approach recently publish ( Fisher et al 2009 ) . 55 patient schizophrenia clinically stable various antipsychotic assign either cognitive training program develop Posit Science ( 50 session administer 5X/week 10 week ) , computerized game control condition mimic time &amp; concentration computer require cognitive training program . Primary outcome change baseline Measurement &amp; Treatment Research Improve Cognition Schizophrenia ( MATRICS ) test battery . The group receive cognitive training show impressive &amp; significantly large improvement control group global cognition , verbal work memory , &amp; verbal learning &amp; memory effect size medium large range ( .56 .86 ) . Important question address study optimal dose &amp; duration cognitive remediation intervention , tolerability &amp; efficacy intervention average IQ schizophrenia population , persistence ( lack thereof ) improvement cognitive function cessation cognitive remediation , functional significance gain cognitive function , &amp; contribution , , type antipsychotic therapy . Additionally , unlikely patient typical clinical setting would able comply rigorous daily cognitive remediation program without financial incentive provide subject study . As noted , study cognitive remediation thus far included subject whatever antipsychotic take study entry . It well know antihistaminergic &amp; antimuscarinic property antipsychotic may impair cognitive process schizophrenia patient . Additionally , antipsychotic vary considerably EPS liability , affect cognitive processing &amp; motor speed . Thus , choice antipsychotic therapy would appear important consideration design cognitive remediation trial schizophrenia patient although study thus far attempt control important variable . Lurasidone novel compound synthesize Sepracor treatment patient schizophrenia &amp; bipolar disorder . It possess high affinity dopamine D2 , serotonin 5-HT2A , 5-HT7 , 5-HT1A &amp; noradrenaline α2C receptor . Compared atypical antipsychotic , lurasidone demonstrate similar bind affinity D2 &amp; 5-HT2A receptor , great affinity serotonin 5-HT1A receptor . Lurasidone display affinity histamine H1 acetylcholine M1 receptor . As September 02 , 2008 , approximately 1560 people receive lurasidone various type clinical study ( e.g. , single dos range 0.1-100 mg , repeat dos 600 mg/day less one week , &amp; repeat dos 120 mg/day 6 week treatment &amp; 80 mg/day 12 month treatment ) . This include approximately 263 healthy volunteer &amp; 1309 schizophrenic schizoaffective disorder subject . Another 600 subject currently enrol ongoing , placebo- , &amp; active comparator control Phase 3 study . Double-blind placebo-controlled &amp; open label study last 6-8 week patient acute exacerbation schizophrenia , suggestive therapeutic dose range lurasidone 40mg/day to120 mg/day give daily . Of special interest animal study observation lurasidone significantly reversed memory impairment induce MK-801 , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , rat step-through type passive avoidance task . The maximum inhibitory effect lurasidone great risperidone , quetiapine , &amp; olanzapine , aripiprazole effective reverse impairment induce MK-801 . Additionally , lurasidone significantly reverse memory impairment induce anticholinergic drug scopolamine passive avoidance task . The reversal pharmacologically induce cognitive deficit rat lurasidone &amp; difference observe antipsychotic promise &amp; warrant specific investigation subject schizophrenia . In study propose build important work do thus far cognitive remediation schizophrenia address limitation previous study . All subject stabilize lurasidone prior initiation cognitive remediation . This provide uniform foundation antipsychotic therapy agent might pro-cognitive effect . Cognitive remediation initiate schizophrenia patient stabilize lurasidone treatment could potentially provide synergistic benefit cognition &amp; functioning . At minimum , lurasidone would expect worsen cognitive functioning , M1 H1 antagonist activity . The cognitive remediation intervention administer small group setting twice weekly 30 session &amp; utilize computerized &amp; verbal group training exercise address basic skill auditory processing , attention , process speed , &amp; verbal work memory &amp; learning , well intermediate &amp; complex skill deductive reasoning , plan &amp; sequence , set shifting , &amp; complex problem solve . Software exercise Posit Science use address deficit basic cognitive skill . Cognitive remediation session include 55 minute session subject engage cognitive exercise computer follow 20 minute `` bridging '' component participant gather circle discus skill practice , might use skill real world task , &amp; learn non-computer base technique enhance cognitive &amp; psychosocial skill order meet overall recovery goal . Outcome measure include improvement cognition assess MATRICS &amp; CAI , &amp; functional outcome use UPSA-B . Two biomarker assessment ( ERP &amp; fMRI ) also conduct subset subject baseline &amp; study completion . Our goal study conduct scientifically rigorous clinical trial optimizes likelihood meaningful improvement cognitive &amp; psychosocial functioning patient schizophrenia . An important consideration study design intervention practical &amp; implemented regular clinical setting . Biomarker assessment provide valuable information neuroanatomical &amp; pathophysiological substrate cognitive impairment &amp; effect therapeutic intervention . PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS The daily dose lurasidone flexibly dose 40 , 80 120 mg base solely clinical consideration &amp; investigator judgment . All dos demonstrate large double-blind placebo-controlled trial effective management acute exacerbation well maintenance treatment schizophrenia . COGNITIVE REMEDIATION The Cognitive Remediation program two principal part : ( 1 ) individualize computer-based cognitive training allow participant hone cognitive skill repeat exercise gradually increase difficulty &amp; complexity ( 2 ) `` bridge '' group therapy session facilitate transfer &amp; application newly learn cognitive skill everyday situation &amp; recovery goal . A building block approach session planning use , learn block increase complexity Basic Intermediate Complex . Three dimension determine complexity task : - Cognitive skill emphasize activity ( one versus multiple skill ) - Cognitive load activity ( difficulty task ) - Goal property task ( proximal versus distal , highly specific versus complex ) Within learn block session introduce assortment computerized cognitive exercise , build upon previous skill learn , reliant achieve 100 % accuracy progress . Thus foundation skill need completely mastered progress onto complicate task . The overarch training model introduce basic cognitive skill begin block , task target one two cognitive skill , proximal goal , &amp; low cognitive load . In addition exercise requisite basic cognitive skill , facilitate self-efficacy &amp; task valuation , turn enhances motivation . Increasingly task become complex &amp; touch upon various cognitive domain . In manner , multiple domain engage simultaneously - case participant must navigate everyday life outside laboratory setting . The `` building block '' approach allow participant gradually train cognitive skill necessary high order executive functioning . The ultimate goal teach memory technique &amp; problem-solving skill successfully steer task computer everyday life Non-specific mental activity Active Control Group ( ACG ) . Participants enrol twice weekly group work various computerized puzzle &amp; mentally stimulating exercise total 30 hour within 6 month timeframe . Commercially available puzzle game provide engage non-specific mental stimulation use active control training exercise . Participants follow similar session timeframe CR group follow healthy lifestyle group . Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV-Clinical Trial ( SCID-CT ) The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Clinical Trial Version ( SCID-CT ) use confirm diagnosis schizophrenia . The SCID-CT semi-structured interview design evaluate DSM-IV Axis I diagnose . It enable trained clinical raters reliably determine Axis I diagnose diverse patient population . Clinician-Rated Side-Effect Scales Patients assess extrapyramidal symptom bradykinesia , rigidity , tremor , hyperkinesias , dystonia , akathisia , involuntary muscle contraction , athetosis , &amp; chorea . EPS-related side effect evaluate standardized scale AIMS , SAS &amp; BAS . Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) The AIMS consist 12 item , 10 rat 4-point scale severity &amp; 2 rat yes . Simpson-Angus Scale ( SAS ) The SAS rating scale use measure EPS &amp; consist list 10 symptom , rat 5-point scale severity . Barnes-Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARNES ) The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale use assess presence &amp; severity akathisia treatment ( baseline ) &amp; schedule visit . This scale consist 4 item ( objective observation akathisia investigator , subjective feeling restlessness patient , patient distress due akathisia , global evaluation akathisia ) . To complete scale , subject observe seated &amp; standing ( minimum two minute position ) . Symptoms observe situation ( e.g. , engage neutral conversation , engage activity ) may also rat . Subjective phenomenon elicit direct questioning . The Positive &amp; Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) The Positive &amp; Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) primary assessment instrument psychopathology . The PANSS contain 30 item assess symptom psychotic disorder include positive , negative &amp; general psychopathology . The PANSS chosen widespread use clinical study psychosis , &amp; demonstrate reliability assess psychopathology across diverse patient population . The PANSS include item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) , additional item Psychopathology Rating Schedule . Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale ( CGI-S ) The Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Severity Scale use repeat evaluation global psychopathology . The CGI-S scale widely use schizophrenia research &amp; single Likert scale rating severity psychopathology scale 1 ( normal , ill ) 7 ( severely ill ) . Calgary Depression Scale Schizophrenia ( CDSS ) The CDSS nine-item scale specifically develop assessment depression patient schizophrenia . Compared HAM-D , less overlap positive &amp; negative psychopathology . Items focus weight change &amp; initial insomnia , confound drug treatment schizophrenia . All item rat four-point scale : 0=absent ; 1=mild ; 2=moderate ; 3=severe . Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) The CSSRS low-burden , clinician-administered tool cover wide spectrum suicidality ideation behavior . With suicide attempt infrequent serve outcome parameter , suicide assessment scale provide validated measure relate variable impulsivity , poor frustration tolerance , sadness , &amp; hopelessness . Service Utilization &amp; Resources Form -Short Form ( SURFs ) The Service Use &amp; Resources Form Schizophrenia ( SURFs ) multi-item self-report form comprehensively document use mental health &amp; non-mental health service use , include number &amp; duration contact &amp; specific type agency service obtain . BIOMARKER STUDIES A total 72 subject ( 36 per group ) participate biomarker study ( ERP &amp; fMRI ) . However still anticipate 50 % total attrition baseline end point &amp; therefore conduct baseline biomarker assessments 144 subject yield 72 completers &amp; 58 subject good data . EVENT RELATED POTENTIALS Verbal episodic memory processing examine measure event-related brain potential ( ERPs ) continuous word recognition test , &amp; behavioral measure verbal work memory obtain use word serial position test ( WSPT ) , extensively used study schizophrenia ( Bruder et al. , 2004 ; Kayser et al. , 1999 ; Kayser et al. , 2006 ; Kayser et al. , 2009 ) . We choose use auditory version test ERP deficit find particularly evident speak word ( Kayser et al. , 2009 ) &amp; enable assessment change auditory process follow cognitive remediation Posit Science auditory training . ERP &amp; behavioral assessment conduct baseline ( previous antipsychotic prior switch lurasidone ) &amp; study end point upon completion cognitive remediation . ERPs During Verbal Episodic Memory : Studies use neuropsychological test find patient schizophrenia display selective deficit verbal learn &amp; memory ( Saykin et al. , 1991 ) . Neuroimaging study link verbal episodic memory deficit schizophrenia leave inferior frontal &amp; medial temporal lobe structure ( Gur et al. , 1994 ; Mozley et al. , 1996 ) . PET study indicate leave inferior frontal cortex involve encode &amp; retrieval word recognition memory task , &amp; schizophrenic patient show reduced activation region stage episodic memory ( Ragl &amp; et al. , 2001 ) . Episodic memory process also examine measure brain ERPs continuous word recognition memory task ( Friedman , 1990b ) . Subjects view hear series word , repeat number intervening word , &amp; task decide whether word new ( previously present ) old ( previously present ) . A robust , replicable find healthy adult great ERP positivity `` old '' compare `` new '' word 250 800 m word onset , refer 'old-new effect . ' The old-new effect interpret neurophysiologic representation retrieval process involve consciously discriminate old new word . Intracranial ERP recording &amp; around medial temporal lobe structure epilepsy patient reveal similar old-new effect , suggest hippocampus , parahippocampal gyrus amygdala may contribute scalp record effect ( Elger et al. , 1997 ) . We use continuous word recognition paradigm ass neurophysiologic correlate episodic memory deficit schizophrenic patient &amp; healthy control ( Kayser et al. , 1999 ) . In recent study ( Kayser et al. , 2009 ) , schizophrenic patient show poor accuracy word recognition , consistent finding impair verbal memory schizophrenia . Patients show marked reduction ERP old-new effect lateral-parietal site . Patients also lack left-greater-than-right hemispheric asymmetry typically observe healthy adult . Impairments electrophysiologic correlate episodic memory robust auditory stimulus , suggest left-lateralized deficit encode &amp; /or retrieval phonological information . Patients also show reduced left-parietal P3 &amp; response-related mid-frontal negativity , likely associate performance monitoring &amp; anterior cingulate cortex . We propose record ERPs use essentially auditory word recognition task prior study ( Kayser et al. , 2009 ) . Words synthesize male voice ( 484 m median duration ) present binaurally headphone comfortable level 70 dB SPL . A constant 2.5 stimulus onset asynchrony &amp; fixation cross minimize eye movement use . The word select dictionary 925 noun . Words arrange two list 80 item , pseudo-randomly assign item list constraint item feature ( e.g. , concreteness imagery norm word ) balance across list . For list , item sequence construct equal number word ( n = 17 ) repeat follow either short lag ( 8 intervene item ) long lag ( 24 intervene item ) . Thus , sequence 34 word repeat , 17 lag , &amp; 46 filler word repeat , yield total 114 item per sequence . Items repeat consider new item first presentation , &amp; old item second presentation , &amp; repeat item would form basis subsequent data analysis . In contrast , never-repeated word consider filler item &amp; include data analysis . Word presentation order pseudo-randomized within sequence yield equal distribution short &amp; long lag . Participants instruct respond every word quickly &amp; accurately possible press one two button response pad indicate whether word `` new '' ( never present series ) `` old '' ( previously present ) . Prior first block , practice trial administer stimulus use test ensure subject understand task &amp; respond appropriately . Each session consist two block 114 trial 5 min rest interval block . The retest session also consist two block , different word . Each session take one hour include electrode preparation . ERP &amp; behavioral data acquire site &amp; send NYSPI processing &amp; analysis . Verbal Working Memory &amp; Tone Discrimination Tests : There considerable evidence work memory impair schizophrenia ( Goldman-Rakic , 1991 ; Park &amp; Holzman , 1992 ; Carter et al. , 1998 ) . We find schizophrenic patient , perform well healthy control tone discrimination test perception &amp; attention , show poor performance control auditory verbal WM test , i.e. , Word Serial Position Test ( WSPT ) , require short-term storage serial position series four word ( Bruder et al. , 2004 ; Wexler et al. , 1998 ) . Moreover , record ERPs work memory test find patient schizophrenia reduce amplitude P3 source leave inferior parietotemporal region ( Kayser et al. , 2006 ) . The WSPT &amp; tone discrimination screen test administer behaviorally ERP measure &amp; take 30 min . In WSPT ( Wexler et al. , 1998 ) , trial begin series four noun speak male voice follow delay interval 9 sec one word . The subject 's task remember four word order present &amp; indicate position probe word sequence . There total 36 trial . Schizophrenic patient show poor performance healthy control verbal work memory test ( Bruder et al. , 2004 ; Wexler et al. , 1998 ) . Moreover , patient perform poorly tone screen test auditory discrimination &amp; attention particularly mark deficit WSPT &amp; episodic memory test , &amp; may benefit auditory training approach cognitive remediation ( Posit Science ) . The tone discrimination task simply judge whether two pure tone separate 100 m different pitch . There 10 practice trial &amp; 60 test trial consist 30 trial tone pair pitch &amp; 30 trial tone different , 6 trial five frequency ratio . The auditory ERP , WSPT , &amp; tone discrimination test may particular value predictor improvement cognitive function follow auditory training &amp; also monitoring change cognitive remediation . fMRI OF WORKING MEMORY &amp; EPISODIC MEMORY Rationale : Working memory ( WM ) , ability hold information `` line '' short period time &amp; often ( always ) manipulate information ( Baddeley 1992 ) , consider one fundamental cognitive impairment schizophrenia . It closely related construct executive dysfunction . Deficits work memory &amp; executive processing relate particularly dysfunction prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) ( Goldman-Rakic 1999 ; Weinberger 2001 ) . The exemplar executive WM task , `` N-back '' task ( Cohen 1994 ) . The `` N-Back '' task require `` continuous updating &amp; order memory . '' It use assess WM function schizophrenia several neuroimaging study &amp; show sensitivity change function pharmacological challenge healthy control ( Mattay 2003 ) &amp; cognitive rehabilitation individual schizophrenia ( Wykes , 2002 ) . Because relative simplicity N-back paradigm , activation measure short time period &amp; few complexity Sternberg type task , &amp; likely yield robust data `` block '' design format substantially short time period storage task . Episodic ( Declarative ) Memory Assessment Rationale : Episodic ( declarative ) memory assess use intentional word encoding follow yes/no recognition test . Tests type robustly activate range brain region know involved pathophysiology schizophrenia , include inferior frontal cortex , parahippocampus , thalamus , parietal cortex &amp; hippocampus . Individuals schizophrenia impaired episodic memory task , &amp; task nature specifically . The paradigm choose task straightforward , easy almost individual schizophrenia complete , relatively easy implement multisite study , &amp; allow assessment basic component episodic encode &amp; retrieval , well proactive interference effect secondary analysis .</detailed_description>
