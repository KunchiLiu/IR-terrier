	<brief_summary>Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( SLL ) similar disease white blood cell typically treated way . Recent research show key enzyme CLL cell responsible cell survival . This enzyme call LYN kinase . Laboratory study show inhibition LYN kinase CLL cell result death CLL cell . Dasatinib ability inhibit LYN kinase , therefore , effect CLL cell . The purpose study see study drug dasatinib , combination fludarabine rituximab , safe effective use people relapse refractory CLL/SLL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib With Fludarabine Rituximab Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) /Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma ( SLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since purpose study determine response rate 3 drug regimen , everyone participates receive dose study drug , dasatinib 2 standard drug , fludarabine rituximab . - Participants receive drug dasatinib , fludarabine , rituximab follow time point cycle treatment . A cycle study treatment 28 day . Dasatinib pills take orally day first 2 week cycle . Fludarabine give intravenously three day cycle ( Days 3-5 first cycle , day 1-3 ) . Rituximab give intravenously total dose 375 mg/m2 cycle ( split Days 3+4 first cycle discretion treat physician Days 1-3 ) . - The following procedure repeat throughout study : medical history review ; physical exam ; performance status test ; blood test EKG . They occur daily first week treatment , weekly rest cycle 1 . After cycle 1 procedure do week 4 week month 6 month . - Tumor assessment repeat every 2 month first six month study , every 6 month . - Blood sample obtain first 5 day treatment pharmacokinetic study pharmacodynamic study . - Participants benefit study treatment first cycle continue receive additional 6 cycle study treatment .</detailed_description>
