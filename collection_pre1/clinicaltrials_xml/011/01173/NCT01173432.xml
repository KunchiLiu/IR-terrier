	<brief_summary>Adipocyte fatty acid bind protein ( A-FABP ) member FABP super family , abundant adipocytes macrophage . Regulatory function A-FABP lipid glucose metabolism describe , suggest play important role pathogenesis metabolic syndrome.We hypothesize obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) may upregulate A-FABP production thus causally contribute metabolic dysfunction . Our group recently demonstrate A-FABP , express secrete adipocytes , present blood stream .The level A-FABP correlate various metabolic variate metabolic syndrome . Furthermore , obtain novel data men range sleep disorder breathing show duration oxygen desaturation correlate circulating level A-FABP , independent age waist/body mass index . The current proposal aim pursue find explore role A-FABP association OSA metabolic dysfunction .</brief_summary>
