	<brief_summary>STA-9090 block Heat Shock Protein-09 ( Hsp90 ) , think involve regulate apoptosis cell death small cell lung cancer . In research study , investigator look see STA-9090 therapeutic effect small cell lung cancer . The investigator also study safety STA-9090 whether measure circulate tumor cell may help assess response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hsp90 Inhibitor , STA-9090 Relapsed Refractory Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) chemotherapy radiotherapy sensitive tumor , high rate relapse metastasis , result poor outcome . Among limited-stage patient , relapse rate least 80 % among extensive-stage patient , relapse rate 95-98 % . The impetus develop effective therapy novel target SCLC therefore high . Hsp-90 inhibitor new class drug important anti-malignant potential variety tumor type reliance multiple oncoproteins Hsp90 function . Although small cell neuroendocrine tumor generally carry many mutated oncoproteins , without clearly define client Hsp90 mediate inhibitor effect cell , recent study demonstrate Hsp90 inhibition cause massive apoptosis activate intrinsic apoptotic pathway number SCLC cell line . SCLC particularly attractive target apoptosis induce drug high growth rate evidence molecular alteration affect apoptotic mechanism . STA-9090 novel , small-molecule inhibitor Hsp90 . Unlike early generation Hsp90 inhibitor , STA-9090 show potent inducer apoptosis variety cell line anti-tumor activity multiple type human xenograft . As see Hsp90 inhibitor , STA-9090 also induce apoptosis number SCLC cell line ( T. Shimamura G. Shapiro , personal communication ) . Based anti-tumor potential see pre-clinically Hsp90 inhibition , potent effect STA-9090 see pre-clinically compare inhibitor class , well early data suggest safety tolerability drug Phase I set , evaluate single-agent activity STA-9090 Phase II trial patient relapse refractory small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>
