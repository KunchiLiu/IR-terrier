	<brief_summary>This pilot study investigate effect acute peanut consumption marker inflammation , triglyceride glucose . The hypothesis high glucose/SFA meal increase postprandial production inflammatory marker , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , addition peanut control meal reduce production CRP , well triglyceride glucose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Peanut Consumption Postprandial Inflammation , Glucose Triglycerides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research demonstrate single meal high saturate fatty acid ( SFA ) glucose induce increase IL-6 , TNF-Î± CRP abdominally obese diabetic subject . As two-thirds U.S. population overweight obese , important identify food attenuate postprandial increase lipid , glucose inflammation population . Therefore , purpose pilot study determine whether high SFA / high glucose control meal induce acute inflammatory response overweight individual , whether addition peanut meal ameliorate response . To ensure effect due peanut , increase total fat , compare response another test meal include oil blend similar fatty acid composition peanut .</detailed_description>
