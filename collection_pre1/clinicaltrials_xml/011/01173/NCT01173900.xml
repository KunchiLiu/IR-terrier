Selected school randomly assign one two delivery strategy ( age-based class-based ) coverage acceptability vaccine delivery strategy compare . Qualitative research conduct , vaccination examine barrier vaccination reason failure complete vaccination well general community perception . To determine factor associate refusal case control study conduct 1:1 sample 350 vaccine refusers 350 accepters . The cost introduce scale HPV vaccine school estimate use establish cost method .</detailed_description>
