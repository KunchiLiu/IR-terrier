	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occur patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Loss muscle protein generally central component weight loss COPD patient . Attempts reverse muscle loss COPD supply large amount protein calorie patient unsuccessful . Gains muscle mass difficult achieve COPD unless specific metabolic abnormality target . The investigator recently observe alteration protein metabolism present normal weight COPD patient . Elevated level protein synthesis breakdown rate find COPD group indicate alteration already present muscle wasting occur . Furthermore , reduce plasma essential amino acid ( EAA ) level observe COPD patient . These reduce EAA plasma level significantly relate presence muscle waste COPD . Until , limit research do examine protein metabolism response feed patient COPD . Previous study support concept essential amino acid ( EAA ) anabolic stimulus young elderly insulin resistant state . Until yet information present anabolic effect EAA elderly COPD patient . It therefore hypothesis high-leucine essential amino acid mixture specifically design stimulate protein anabolism target metabolic alteration COPD patient . In present study , acute effect EAA nutritional supplement whole body , muscle liver protein metabolism examine COPD patient compare supplement consist balanced mixture total amino acid . The principal endpoint extent stimulation whole body protein synthesis principal mechanism either amino acid protein intake cause muscle anabolism , reduction endogenous protein breakdown . Both endpoint assess isotope methodology think reference method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study investigator test follow hypothesis : A high-leucine essential amino acid mixture ( dose 7.0 g EAA + 15 g carbohydrate ) stimulate protein anabolism great extent standard balance mixture total ( essential non-essential ) amino acid ( dose 6.7 g total AA + 15 g carbohydrate ) COPD patient . The principal endpoint extent stimulation protein synthesis rate reduction endogenous protein breakdown . The current project provide information enable u good understand underlie metabolic mechanism regulate protein metabolism patient COPD .</detailed_description>
