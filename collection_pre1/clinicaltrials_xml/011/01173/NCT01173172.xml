	<brief_summary>This boron neutron capture ( BNCT ) therapy patient previously irradiate locally recurrent head neck cancer . The primary end point treatment toxicity response rate . The secondary endpoint time tumor progression , progression-free survival , overall survival change quality life . Head neck carcinoma recur locally conventional irradiation pose therapeutic challenge . Boron neutron capture therapy ( BNCT ) base nuclear capture reaction occur non-radioactive boron irradiate neutron thermal energy yield high energy alpha particle recoil lithium nucleus . The effect alpha 7Li primarily limit boron- containing cell . Preferential uptake boron cancerous tissue achieve use boron carrier derivative phenylalanine , boronophenylalanine ( BPA ) . After administration BPA intra-arterial intravenous infusion , tumor site irradiated neutron , source currently nuclear reactor . A uncontrolled clinical trial evaluate BNCT treatment glioblastoma brain surgery . In study , median survival time 13-15 month BNCT . However , efficacy tolerability BNCT treatment limit number head neck cancer patient show promising result . Though many basic research BNCT do use Tsing Hua Open-pool Reactor ( THOR ) National Tsing Hua University , clinical trial utilize BNCT perform country . This study first BNCT trial treat head neck cancer Taiwan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Boron Neutron Capture Therapy ( BNCT ) Locally Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single arm , open label phase I/II trial boron neutron capture ( BNCT ) therapy patient previously irradiate locally recurrent head neck cancer . The eligibility criterion patient locoregionally recurrent head neck cancer ; good performance status ; inoperable , clinical measurable tumor size ; good organ function good compliance . No systemic treatment use . Once enter study , patient receive angiography evaluate bloody supply tumor PET scan 18F-fluoro-L-BPA tracer . Tumor-to- normal tissue ratio evaluate static emission scan . Boron concentration normal tissue derive measurement BPA concentration blood . Treatment planning THORplan do Computerized Tomography ( CT ) simulation . After treatment plan approve day treatment , intravenous intra-arterial L-BPA- Fructose complex 500 mg/kg administer constant rate 3 hour neutron irradiation . Neutron beam irradiation give THOR prescription dose 20 25 Gy ( Eq ) tumor one fraction day 1 repeat day 30 . Patients regularly follow OPD toxicity ( NCI Common Terminology Criteria ) response evaluation ( RECIST criterion ) MRI PET , time progression measurement , survival status change quality life . Maximally 27 patient enrol . After first 10 patient , preliminary result review patient ' enrollment .</detailed_description>
