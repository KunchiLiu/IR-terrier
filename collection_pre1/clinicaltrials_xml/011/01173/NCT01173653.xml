A background statistical analysis literature review already conduct . A literature review attach reference ( see Appendix A ) . We discuss topic biostatistical liaison believe study show statistical significance appropriate power base target enrollment 150 patient . Following anticipated IRB approval , expect study ready enrollment . Mr. Pelster lead enrollee within Adult Emergency Department full support ED faculty staff work . He supervise directly Dr. Benjamin Heavrin , Assistant Professor Emergency Medicine , function faculty sponsor VUSM emphasis program .
