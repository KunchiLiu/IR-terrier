	<brief_title>A Study 28431754 ( Canagliflozin ) Gastrointestinal Glucose Absorption Metabolism Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center study conduct two Parts ( Part 1 Part 2 ) evaluate effect single-dose canagliflozin absorption glucose healthy volunteer . Part 1 pilot ( small ) study response key pharmocodynamic ( PD ) parameter ( ie , specific test blood sample evaluate effect treatment body ) measure confirm study design number volunteer plan Part 2 . Part 2 main study volunteer randomize ( assign study drug placebo chance ) receive double-blind ( neither volunteer study physician know identity treatment assign ) treatment canagliflozin placebo ( treatment identical appearance canagliflozin contain active drug ) evaluate effect canagliflozin compare placebo gastrointestinal glucose absorption use radiolabeled glucose tracer approach ( ie , radioactive substance combine glucose allow movement glucose body trace detect ) . Blood urine sample collect volunteer pre-defined time study PD analysis . Safety monitor study evaluate adverse event result clinical laboratory test , vital sign measurement , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination perform . Volunteers Part 1 receive 240 ml water 10 minute start MMTT period ( Periods 1 2 ) . Volunteers Part 2 receive study drug 20 minute prior start MMTT treatment sequence 1 ( single 300-mg dose canagliflozin Period 1 follow matching placebo Period 2 ) treatment Sequence 2 ( match placebo Period 1 follow single 300-mg dose canagliflozin Period 2 ) . Periods 1 2 separate 7 21 day .</detailed_description>
