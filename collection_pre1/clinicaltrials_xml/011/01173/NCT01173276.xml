	<detailed_description>This study aim assess feasibility novel standard care technique intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) HIV-discordant couple United States . This study involve couple male partner HIV positive , female partner negative . The investigator institute protocol similar use presently throughout Europe good success . To date , HIV seroconversions occur 4000 insemination perform HIV serodiscordant couple . All male subject stable HAART undetectable serum viral load prior insemination . For semen sample , seminal fluid separate sperm use density gradient/swim-up separation technique . The purified sperm sample wash , screen HIV RNA use sensitive real-time RT-PCR . Samples detectable trace HIV RNA use insemination . Samples detectable trace HIV RNA use standard intrauterine insemination female partner . Female subject follow post-insemination seroconversion pregnancy . Infants follow seroconversion birth 3 month age . The data collect pilot feasibility study mostly descriptive , lack sample size achieve statistical power testing . However , investigator use case-control analysis compare couple achieve pregnancy across demographic marker HIV disease progression . Additionally , investigator develop 14 item , 5-point Likert scale assess psychosocial impact reproductive health issue stem HIV-discordance female male participant . The expected duration unique subject couple 3 12 month , depend pregnancy . It expect interventional portion study continue 2 year , depend pregnancy .</detailed_description>
