	<detailed_description>The overall study objective : 1 . To determine longitudinal relationship circulate NRG-1β level incident risk adverse cardiovascular outcome patient exposed anthracycline , trastuzumab , combination two agent . We hypothesize sustained increase NRG-1β , indicative enhance cardiac stress exposure chemotherapeutic agent , predictive increase risk cardiac dysfunction heart failure . 2 . To study SNP/haplotype variation Neuregulin/ErbB signal pathway incident risk adverse cardiovascular outcome . We hypothesize SNP/haplotypes variation associate incident cardiovascular outcome . 3 . To determine longitudinal relationship echocardiographic measure strain strain rate incident cardiac dysfunction patient expose anthracycline , trastuzumab , combination two agent . We hypothesize early decline strain strain rate predictive increase risk future cardiac dysfunction heart failure . 4 . To explore change NRG-1β level relationship novel echocardiographic measure cardiac function . 5 . To create biobank future resource additional question novel biomarkers genetics . 6 . To determine long-term effect cancer therapy cardiotoxicity follow patient yearly total 5 year exposure cancer therapy .</detailed_description>
