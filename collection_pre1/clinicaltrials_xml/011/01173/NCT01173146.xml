	<brief_summary>Prostate Cancer common cancer men , affect many men woman diagnose breast cancer , kill many men per year breast cancer kill woman . The common surgical treatment prostatectomy , removal prostate . During prostate surgery , tumor remain edge surgery , call residual tumor , 30 % prostatectomy . Such patient significantly high risk local recurrence cancer , high rate death . In contrast , even patient cancer outside prostate , still nearby prostate , good margin make clean tumor surgery . The investigator propose reduce number patient residual tumor surgery . The investigator test patient fluorescent molecule allow cancer detect surgery . If trial work design , investigator reduce number patient receive additional treatment , high dos radiation low abdomen , amount residual tumor leave behind minimized . This may also lead high rate survival . This type detection cancer investigator employ call Molecular imaging . The investigator believe molecular imaging key improve diagnosis , individualize treatment selection , treatment monitoring . If successful , large human trial conduct study corporate imaging partner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Residual Tumor During Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 5 year academic-industrial partnership FDA approval , experience team partner include Cornell , Vanderbilt , Intuitive Surgical , LI-COR , Sand Hill Institute , move prostate-targeted fluorescent contrast agent , demonstrate animal prior project allow real-time detection residual tumor , FDA approval human use . The unmet need prostate tumor surgical margin undetectable real time , residual tumor margin occur 30 % prostatectomy . Such patient significantly high risk local recurrence , metastasis , death , also require radiation therapy . In contrast , even patient extra-prostatic extension tumor well margin make clean tumor surgery . We propose leverage experience animal-proven agent synthesize , receive FDA IND approval , Phase I/II test target fluorescent conjugate pilot study 96 human subject . Our agent make commercial LI-COR fluorescent dye , humanize antibody Cornell Millennium Pharmaceuticals ( huJ-591 ) . The targeted antibody tags Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen ( PSMA ) present outside prostate cell luminal ( prostate duct ) origin , demonstrate prior funding produce 4-12 fold contrast prostate cell nearby tissue animal . The device test site use fluorescence-sensitive surgery system Intuitive Surgical , $ 10 billion robotic surgery company . The PI grant previously develop commercialized fundamental optical technology -- ( 1 ) co-developed first vivo luciferase image system Stanford co-founded Xenogen , ( 2 ) develop T-StatÂ® , first FDA-approved detection system insufficient blood flow tissue . Other team member synthesize dye conjugate commercial use , manage antibody-based drug formulation FDA approval . The corporate partner , LiCor ( world-leader automate sequence instrument reagent use near infrared device dye ) Sand Hill Institute ( experience antibody formulation ) , Intuitive Surgical , provide proven commercial translational experience contrast agent FDA approval . These group formulate synthesize agent , lead FDA IND file human clinical testing . Alternative path minimize risk stage . If successful , commercial dye readied Phase III multi-center trial major surgical tool partner , costly require path market introduction . Major image company ( Siemens , Phillips , GE , others ) also molecular image program , contract agent fit . A successful imaging agent would likely adopt . Extensions ovarian cancer use folate type II receptor , target , envision , include use target antibody develop group . We anticipate among first many real-time surgery-targeting optical contrast agent human subject . Areas immediate application detection lymphatic spread intraoperatively prostate cancer , well ovarian cancer use Folate . We expect market device cancer could reasonably hundred million dollars/year .</detailed_description>
