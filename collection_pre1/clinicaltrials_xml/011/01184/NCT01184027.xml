	<brief_summary>Weight loss result poor food intake common head neck cancer patient . Currently , feed tube place start treatment provide nutrition prevent weight loss . However , study always show feeding tube prevent weight loss . Also , limit food intake mouth may lead swallow problem . The aim study compare effect diet swallow therapy feed tube placement . In study , weight , food intake , swallow ability , side-effects treatment monitor , , 3 6 month treatment see difference therapy group . The investigator hope addition diet swallow therapy treatment improve food intake swallowing ability still maintain weight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Nutrition Swallowing Function Head Neck Cancer Patients During Course Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Multimodal treatment advance head neck cancer ( HNC ) associate acute toxicity include mucositis , xerostomia , dysphagia high prevalence weight loss , require nutritional intervention . Currently , ongoing debate best way provide nutrition support undergo chemoradiation ( CRT ) therapy surgery advance head neck cancer ( HNC ) . Randomized controlled trial compare nutritional benefit feed tube dietary counseling and/or supplementation conclusively demonstrate reduction weight loss , unplanned hospitalization , treatment toxicity , tumour control . Additionally , relative benefit feed tubes controversial . Studies evaluate efficacy feed tubes report patient feed tube increase risk aspiration , feed tube dependence , small finite risk tumour seeding , importantly long term functional swallowing impairment . However , emerge data report swallow exercise program design strengthen musculature throughout course treatment may lead improved return functional swallowing . Thus , preservation functional swallowing may potentially improve return oral nutrition . Purpose : Our purpose study compare efficacy nutritional swallow intervention with/out percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube ad lib nutrition swallow counsel with/out PEG tube advance HNC patient . Weight , caloric intake , instrumental swallowing function , xerostomia , mucositis , pain , unplanned treatment interruption , unplanned hospital admission , complication , duration feed tube , tumour control , performance status , quality life ( QOL ) assess , , 3 6 month CRT therapy determine difference intervention group . Study Design : A randomize controlled longitudinal design entire course treatment include surgery CRT therapy conduct investigate efficacy nutritional swallowing intervention HNC patient baseline , course consecutive course treatment 3 6 month follow-up . Patients demonstrate safe functional swallow follow surgery randomly assign one four group : Group 1 - patient receive PEG tube/in-depth nutrition swallow intervention ; Group 2 - patient receive PEG tube/ad lib nutrition swallow counseling ; Group 3 - patient receive in-depth nutrition swallow intervention ; Group 4 - patient receive ad lib nutrition/Kaofeed tube nutrition swallow counseling . Study Sample : Patients diagnosis HNC oral cavity , pharynx , larynx undergoing surgery CRT therapy University Alberta Hospital ( UAH ) Cross Cancer Institute ( CCI ) eligible participation study . Inclusion criterion : ≥ 18 year age ; diagnose HNC sit oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx ; histologic type cancer ; advance tumour stage ; form radiation therapy ( RT ) include standard investigational HNC ; form chemotherapy ( CT ) include standard investigational HNC ; alert mentally competent ; English-speaking . Exclusion criterion : unable safe swallow follow surgical intervention ; allergy intolerance enteral nutritional supplement current use ; renal insufficiency . There approximately 3-4 HNC patient schedule surgery , CRT therapy per week UAH/CCI . With significance level 0.01 group power 0.85 ( effect size 0.9 ) minimum sample size 41 patient require study . As pilot study 20 degree freedom , adequate reasonable sample size would require 24 patient recruited participate . Data Collection : Patients inform study consent obtain . Demographic clinical data collect time recruitment . Patient 's height weight record . Patients ask complete Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment , Head Neck Symptom Checklist , Edmonton Symptom Assessment Score University Washington Quality Life Revised Questionnaire . Patients give instruction complete 24h dietary recall , assessment mucositis xerostomia appointment modify barium swallow . After surgery , patient 's verified safe swallow speech-language pathologist ( SLP ) MBS randomize 1 4 group . Patient randomize Group 1 2 percutaneous gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube insert per gastroenterology PEG tube insertion protocol . Patients randomize Group 1 3 additional nutrition swallow intervention . Patients randomize Group 3 4 symptom prevent swallow &gt; 5 % weight loss treatment offer Kaofeed tube nutrition supplementation . Nutritional intervention outline study Ravasco et al . ( 2005 ) Goncalves Dias et al ( 2005 ) include individualized nutrition orientation therapeutic diet aid patient achieve caloric protein intake promotes approximately 40 kcal/kg/day . The nurse practitioner together patient meet daily basis review therapeutic diet resolve issue symptom management prevent dietary intake . Swallowing intervention include evaluation functional swallowing SLP . The SLP together patient meet daily basis review functional swallowing teach/aid patient adjust swallow meet change safe swallow need . All parameter study measurement outline Table 1 . Data Analysis : Descriptive statistic use generate profile nutrition status , caloric intake , nutrition impact symptom , swallow function , quality life , unplanned treatment interruption , unplanned hospital admission , complication HNC patient baseline , course consecutive course treatment 3 month follow-up . Changes , well difference nutrition status , caloric intake , nutrition impact symptom , quality life swallow function course treatment , 3 month follow-up examine use t-tests analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Significance Study : The high prevalence negative consequence weight loss , primarily stem dysphagia advance HNC patient use current multimodal treatment regime support need determine effective nutritional management patient group . Additionally , pilot study may establish foundation future protocols guideline nutritional care HNC patient .</detailed_description>
