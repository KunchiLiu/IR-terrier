	<brief_summary>Although drug therapy greatly improve blood pressure ( BP ) control reduction cardiovascular event , many 50 % hypertensive drug treatment inadequately control BP due poor adherence , insufficiently aggressive treatment , aversion part many patient drug treatment . Device-guided breathe behavioral intervention guide breathe 6 per minute range , induce respiratory sinus arrythmia ( RSA ) , natural cycle arrythmia occur influence breathe flow sympathetic vagus impulses sinoatrial node heart . It show several small trial substantial effect BP reduction , know side-effects , may represent cost-effective adjunctive treatment hypertension . important consideration , often , behavioral intervention give brief amount time , expect long-term effect . This hold true medication ; one would give anti-hypertensive medication eight week expect effect BP several month later . The development behavioral intervention need take account method sustain long-term effect . Our aim conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) test efficacy guide breathe intervention ambulatory BP ( ABP ) hypertensives draw primary care specialty hypertension practice , use sample size power detect effect 8 week 4-month follow-up . We also propose study physiological mechanism , baroreflex sensitivity , may mediate effect intervention BP . The design call two control group : Usual Care ( UC ) relaxation placebo condition ( use device give type feedback sound guided breathe feedback device , modify pace breathe approximately 13 breath per minute , normal rest rate . ) There two intervention condition use RESPeRate device guide breath 6 breaths/minute range . In , initial intervention last eight week , follow participant randomize either : 1 ) end intervention ; 2 ) continue intervention next 8 week . The main outcome change systolic diastolic BP ( measure Ambulatory BP monitoring ) waking hour . Outcomes measure baseline , 8 week , 16 week</brief_summary>
