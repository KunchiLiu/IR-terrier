	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate sound stimulation could improve pure-tone hearing threshold . In late 1990s , researcher discover acoustic stimulus slow progressive sensorineural hearing loss exposure moderately augment acoustic environment delay loss auditory function . In addition , prolonged exposure augment acoustic environment could improve age-related auditory change . These ameliorative effect show several type mouse strain , long acoustic environment provide prior occurrence severe hearing loss . In addition delay progressive hearing loss , acoustic stimulus could also protect hear ability damage traumatic noise . In particular , method call forward sound conditioning ( i.e. , prior exposure moderate level sound ) show reduce noise-induced hearing impairment number mammalian specie , include human . Interestingly , recent report suggest low-level sound conditioning also reduce free radical-induced damage hair cell , increase antioxidant enzyme activity , reduce Cox-2 expression cochlea , enhance cochlear sensitivity . Specifically , increase cochlear sensitivity observe distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) compound action potential ( CAPs ) measure . In addition forward sound conditioning , backward sound conditioning ( i.e. , use acoustic stimulus exposure traumatic noise ) show protect hearing ability acoustic trauma prevent cortical map reorganization induce traumatic noise . Based result animal study , investigator conduct human study 2007 observe sound stimulation could improve hear ability . On average , pure-tone hearing threshold decrease 8.91 dB sound stimulation 2 week . In study , however , investigator observe hear threshold change sound stimulation . To verify previous ameliorative effect sound stimulation , investigator include control period study .</brief_summary>
