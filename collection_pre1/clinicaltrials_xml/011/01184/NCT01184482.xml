	<brief_summary>This trial patient colon cancer , head neck cancer lung cancer respond standard therapy . Cetuximab target receptor cancer cell call Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor EGFR . It think receptor turn `` '' cancer , enable cancer cell divide grow . Blocking receptor turn signal . Cetuximab block receptor outside cancer cell . It think cancer cell turn signal back EGFR joining related receptor call ErbB2 . Lapatinib block EGFR ErbB2 inside cancer cell . In laboratory experiment find combine drug target EGFR ErbB2 might work well turn signal back . The purpose study determine maximum dosage patient tolerate two medicine give time . In addition , order trial , patient must agree tumor biopsy start treatment study 21 day start treatment . These biopsy require part study . Patients must also agree blood draw research test see whether genetic difference patient explain different reaction side effect , medicine .</brief_summary>
