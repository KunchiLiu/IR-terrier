	<brief_title>A Phase I Study SB939 Pediatric Patients With Refractory Solid Tumours Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part A study , SB939 give child solid tumour . The purpose Part A study ind high dose new drug SB939 giben child without cause severe side effect tolerable . In Part B study , SB939 give child leukemia . The purpose Part B , see whether dose determine best dose patient solid tumour also best dose child leukemia . In Part C study , SB939 give together 13-cis-retinoic acid . The purpose Part C , see whether SB939 dose determine best dose Part A also best dose give combination 13-cis-retinoic acid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients part study must histological verification malignancy either original diagnosis relapse . For Part A , patient must recurrent refractory solid tumour , lymphoma CNS tumour ( exclude diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ) . For Part B , patient must recurrent refractory leukemia . For Part C , patient must one follow diagnosis : neuroblastoma , medulloblastoma / CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumour ( PNET ) . Disease Status Patients solid tumour must either measurable evaluable disease ( define positive nuclear scan bone scan metaiodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) scan . For part C , case neuroblastoma , lesion isolate /or previously irradiate stable , proven positive biopsy require eligible . Patients refractory relapse leukemia must great 25 % blast bone marrow ( M3 bone marrow ) ; active extramedullary disease may also present . Patients leptomeningeal disease eligible . Therapeutic Options : The patient 's current disease state must one know curative therapy therapy proven prolong survival acceptable quality life . Prior Systemic Therapy Patients must recover acute effect prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy radiotherapy prior study entry follow : At least 3 week completion myelosuppressive chemotherapy , biologic agent investigational cancer treatment At least 7 day completion therapy growth factor At least 6 week hematopoietic stem cell rescue follow myeloablative therapy Post allogeneic hematopoietic transplant patient eligible , must evidence active graft vs. host disease At least 2 week completion local palliative XRT ( small port ) At least 3 month must elapse prior total body irradiation , craniospinal XRT ≥ 50 % radiation pelvis At least 6 week must elapse substantial bone marrow irradiation At least 6 week prior MIBG therapy Age &gt; 12 month ≤ 18 year time study entry . Performance Status : Karnofsky ≥ 60 % patient &gt; 10 year ; Lansky ≥ 50 patient ≤ 10 year . For Patients Solid Tumours ( Parts A C ) : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10 ( power 9 ) /L Platelets ≥100 x 10 ( power 9 ) /L Hemoglobin ≥ 80 g/L For Patients Leukemia ( Part B ) No minimum absolute neutrophil count Platelet count ≥ 20 x 10 ( power 9 ) /L ( may receive transfusion ) Hemoglobin ≥ 80 g/L ( may receive transfusion ) serum creatinine ≤ 1 . 5 x upper limit normal age measure GFR ≥ 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 LVEF ECHO MUGA Scan within normal institutional limit QTc ≤ 450 msec AST ALT ≤ 5.0 x upper limit normal age bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal age Additional Criteria For Part C Of The Study Skin toxicity ( exclude alopecia ) ≤ Grade 1 Serum triglyceride ( fast ) &lt; 3.4 mmol/L Negative urine dipstick protein OR &lt; 1000 mg protein/24 hour urine collection No evidence gross hematuria Patient guardian consent must obtain patient accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . Protocol treatment begin within five working day patient registration . Cardiac Exclusions . Patients pathologic cardiac arrhythmia require active treatment . Patients history arrhythmia must &gt; 12 month since last treatment recurrence arrhythmia interval . Inability To Take Oral Medication . Patients must able take oral medication gastrointestinal abnormality ( e.g . bowel obstruction previous gastric resection ) would lead inadequate absorption SB939 . Known HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Current treatment agent know risk Torsades de Pointes http : //torsades.org ( list # 1 ) . Preexisting peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 3 . There available information regard human fetal teratogenic toxicity relate SB939 . 13cisretinoic acid know teratogenic . Pregnancy test must obtain girl post menarchal . Males female reproductive potential may participate unless agreed effective contraceptive method . Pregnant breast feeding female enter study due potential fetal teratogenic adverse event .</criteria>
