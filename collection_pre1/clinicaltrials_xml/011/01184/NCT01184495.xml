	<criteria>We include adult patient chronic renal failure hemodialysis three month Dialysis Unit Department Nephrology , HCPA Center Dialysis Transplant ( CDT ) , characterize patient chronic regular dialysis procedure . Patients already use EPO least three month , take drug subcutaneous agree participate study . Patients use different dos EPO include , distribute across treatment group randomization stratum dose EPO , ensure even distribution patient group . It consider patient HIV AIDS treatment disease proper clinical management would eligible study ( exemplified patient HIV AIDS approve inclusion wait list cadaveric kidney transplantation ) . Patients history cancer already treat oncological standpoint , sign disease activity could include . Patients cause anemia defined maintenance , example , patient liver cirrhosis , history gastrointestinal bleeding , patient chronic Gastro Intestinal , Genital Urinary bleeding site exclude . Similarly patient AIDS without treatment , hemolytic anemia , pancytopenia , thalassemia , sickle cell anemia , myelodysplasia , multiple myeloma cancer inflammatory arthritis . There also inclusion patient intolerance allergy iron parenterally , patient without adherence dialysis chronic inadequate dialysis blood flow vascular access persistently 250 mL / min , kt / v , measure efficiency hemodialysis , persistently &lt; 1.2 ) frequent hospitalization consider possible cause inadequate response erythropoietin . We exclude patient mental illness condition prevents free consent signature inform consent , well previous report serious adverse effect drug study . Criteria withdrawal clinical trial : view high morbidity hemodialysis patient , express frequent hospital clinic , find patient study would withdraw study due hospitalization , provide : hospital involve surgery ( except vascular access surgery hospitalization intensive care unit equivalent , represent otherwise , loss patient followup cointerventions treatment anemia ) . Were withdrawn study patient require blood transfusion severe anemia intervention unrelated usual treatment anemia hemodialysis patient .</criteria>
