	<criteria>IVIGuntreated subject : Either subject newly diagnose CIDP ( develop least 2 month ) subject IVIG treatment interruption least 1 year progressive disease ( deteriorate last 2 month ) prior enrolment . Actual diagnosis ( include electrophysiology ) CIDP progressive relapse dysfunction motor sensory symmetric motor nerve least 1 limb result neuropathy . Criteria definite probable CIDP accord EFNS/PNS guideline . Age ≥18 year . Male female . Written inform consent study participation obtain undergo study specific procedure . IVIGpretreated subject : Being treat regularly IVIG fixed cycle length 2 6 week ± 5 day last 6 month , fix dosage ± 20 % last 6 month deteriorate least 1 INCAT score point Washout Period 10 week ( except increase 0 1 solely due upper limb score ) . Historic diagnosis CIDP progressive relapse dysfunction motor sensory symmetric motor nerve least 1 limb result neuropathy . Criteria definite probable CIDP accord EFNS/PNS guideline . Age ≥18 year . Male female . Written inform consent study participation obtain undergo study specific procedure . A motor syndrome fulfils criteria multifocal motor neuropathy ( MMN ) conduction block ( i.e. , upper limb motor weakness without sensory deficit 50 % decrease action potential amplitude area proximal compare distal stimulation motor nerve ) . CIDP monoclonal gammopathy uncertain significance ( CIDPMGUS ) antiMGUS antibody patient distal acquire demyelinate symmetric ( DADS ) neuropathy . Any disease ( mainly neurological chronic orthopedic ) may cause symptom may interfere treatment outcome assessment INCAT ( e.g. , diphtheria , drug toxin exposure diabetes mellitus likely cause neuropathy , IgM paraproteinemia , familial neuropathy , borreliosis radiculopathy , postpoliosyndrome , M . Parkinson , stroke ) . Current malignancy . History cardiac insufficiency ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] III/IV ) , cardiomyopathy , significant cardiac dysrhythmia require treatment , unstable advanced ischemic heart disease , congestive heart failure severe hypertension . History thrombotic episode ( deep vein thrombosis , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ) . Migraine associate IVIG infusion last 3 month prior enrolment . Known allergic severe reaction blood product include intolerability previous IVIG ( i.e . severe headache , hypersensitivity , intravascular hemolysis ) . Subjects serum IgA level le 50 % low normal limit . Known hyperprolinemia . Any condition ( include alcohol , drug medication abuse ) likely interfere evaluation study product satisfactory conduct study . Plasma exchange 3 month prior enrolment . Treatment immunomodulatory agent others steroid , methotrexate azathioprine ( e.g . interferon , TNFα inhibitor ) within 6 month enrolment . Treatment rituximab 12 month enrolment . Abnormal laboratory parameter : creatinine &gt; 1.5 time upper normal limit ( UNL ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) &gt; 1.5 time UNL , Creactive protein ( CRP ) &gt; 1.5 time UNL , hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 10 g/dL . Ongoing HIV , hepatitis C hepatitis B infection . Participation another clinical study ( use another investigational medicinal product [ IMP ] ) within 3 month prior enrolment Not able comply study procedure treatment regimen . Employee study site , spouse/partner relative study staff ( e.g. , investigator , subinvestigators , study nurse ) . Pregnancy nurse mother . Intention become pregnant course study . Female subject childbearing potential either use , willing use , medically reliable method contraception entire duration study , sexually abstinent entire duration study , surgically sterile .</criteria>
