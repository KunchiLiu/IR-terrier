	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect pioglitazone versus drug soluble profinflammatory marker peritoneal fluid woman endometriosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endometriosis : Immunomodulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal assess modulation immune mechanisms endometriosis . Endometriosis common ailment affect approximately five million reproductive-aged American woman . We test efficacy novel immunomodulatory drug ( peroxisome proliferator activate receptor gamma , PPAR-gamma , agonist ) , pioglitazone , reduce peritoneal fluid cytokine concentration woman endometriosis compare non-treated control ( randomize control trial ) . Based prior study do investigator highlight major role cytokine immune system genesis propagation endometriosis , experiment could lead improved translational treatment strategy well understanding endometriosis . Acting PPAR-gamma , TZDs inhibit proinflammatory cytokine well NF-kB , important nuclear transcription factor production many cytokine . Accordingly , since human endometrial epithelial stromal cell contain PPAR-gamma , felt would useful evaluate influence PPAR-gamma ligand , pioglitazone , concentration specific peritoneal fluid cytokine . Comparison : After pre-trial screening , eligible subject presume endometriosis age 18-45 consent randomly assign receive either pioglitazone ( 30 mg , daily ) drug 2 week . Peritoneal fluid collect time surgery volume measure . All patient enrol study surgery follicular phase cycle order minimize difference volume cytokine concentration due cyclical change . The primary measure peritoneal fluid concentration comparison two group assess six different cytokine .</detailed_description>
