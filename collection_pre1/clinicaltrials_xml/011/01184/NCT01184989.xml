Written inform consent 4 . Caucasian patient Exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients weigh less 40 kg . 2 . Patients require chronic treatment anticoagulant ( e.g . vitamin K antagonists ; e.g . patient atrial fibrillation , patient artificial heart valve , etc. ) . 3 . Patients investigator 's judgment perceive excessive risk bleeding , example : Constitutional acquire coagulation disorder History bleed diathesis Clinically relevant bleeding ( gastrointestinal , pulmonary , intraocular urogenital bleeding ) within 3 month enrolment Major surgery trauma ( e.g . hip fracture ) within 3 month enrolment History thrombocytopenia , include heparininduced thrombocytopenia , platelet count &lt; 100 000 cells/microliter randomization Any history hemorrhagic stroke follow intracranial pathology : bleeding , neoplasm Any arteriovenous malformation , vascular aneurysm major intraspinal intracerebral vascular abnormality Presence malignant neoplasm high risk bleed Known suspect oesophageal varix Symptomatic endoscopically document gastroduodenal ulcer disease previous 30 day Treatment anticoagulant , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , abciximab , aspirin &gt; 162.5 mg/day nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) t1/2 &gt; 12 hour within 7 day prior hip knee replacement surgery OR anticipate need patient receive study medication prior 24 hour last administration study medication ( COX2 selective inhibitor allow ) anticipate need quinidine , verapamil restrict medication treatment period 4 .
