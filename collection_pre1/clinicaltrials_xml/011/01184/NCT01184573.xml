	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate feasibility use non-invasive , non-radioactive Pancreatic Breath Test ( PBT ) diagnostic tool detect early stage chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) . If successful , method could important advantage exist diagnostic test detect early stage CP . This diagnostic breath test may clinical impact lead early detection CP intervention mitigate disease progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disorders pancreas affect one million person country nearly $ 3 billion health care cost . The incidence rate chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) rapidly increase may relate expand alcohol abuse . Advanced CP easily detect image technique . However , mild moderate CP present difficult challenge clinician . Imaging technique fail recognize less advanced CP case 40 % time . The gold standard monitor early stage CP secretin stimulation test . However , secretin stimulation test do US center . The investigator develop Pancreatic Breath Test ( PBT ) alternative secretin stimulation test . The breath test use tracer dose sodium 13C-bicarbonate detect amount bicarbonate release stimulation pancreatitis meal ( liquid Ensure ) . A normal pancreas release unlabeled bicarbonate upon stimulation , decrease ratio 13C/12C exhaled carbon dioxide . This ratio change much less diseased pancreas . A case-control study 25 mild moderate CP patient 25 healthy control utilized show feasibility new breath test .</detailed_description>
