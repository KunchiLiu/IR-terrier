	<detailed_description>Effective medical treatment follow acute coronary syndrome percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) consist dual anti-platelet therapy aspirin clopidogrel . Despite treatment approach , substantial portion patient continue experience increase rate subsequent adverse cardiovascular event include death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis . This persistent vulnerability associate inadequate platelet inhibition response clopidogrel administration , phenomenon refer clopidogrel resistance . Although multiple variable implicate clopidogrel resistance , mount evidence suggest crucial role loss-of-function CYP2C19*2 genetic variant . Presence *2 allele associate 1.5- 6-fold increase risk cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , stent thrombosis follow PCI patient treat clopidogrel . These finding , recently bolster meta-analysis , lead American Food Drug Administration issue box warn clopidogrel state poor metabolizers may receive full benefit drug . Consequently , expert begin advocate routine genotyping context dual anti-platelet therapy follow PCI . A personalized approach dual anti-platelet therapy follow PCI feasible give presence treatment alternative prasugrel capable overcome clopidogrel resistance . Selective administration prasugrel patient increase risk clopidogrel resistance potential successfully minimize adverse ischemic event , simultaneously minimize associate bleed event health care cost . A prospective pharmacogenomic approach anti-platelet therapy previously hamper limited access time-delay associate genetic testing . The development point-of-care CYP2C19*2 genetic test require minimal train operate carry potential overcome obstacle may facilitate incorporation pharmacogenomic strategy routine clinical practice . Patients receive percutaneous coronary intervention context non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome stable coronary artery disease randomize either rapid genotyping strategy standard therapy . Patients Rapid Genotyping arm screen presence CYP2C19*2 allele use point-of-care genetic test . Carriers *2 allele receive prasugrel 10 mg daily 1 week . Non-*2 carrier Rapid Genotyping arm patient Standard Therapy arm receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily . At end 1 week period , efficacy treatment strategy evaluate use VerifyNow platelet function testing .</detailed_description>
