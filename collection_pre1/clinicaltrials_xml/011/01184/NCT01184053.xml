	<brief_title>Trisenox® Women With Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single arm , single institution , phase II trial design assess response rate safety Trisenox® woman recurrent endometrial carcinoma . Trisenox® administer dose 0.25 mg/kg/day 5 consecutive day ( D1-5 ) every 4 week . A 4-week period define cycle treatment . Marker non-marker lesion assess every 2 cycle ( every 8 week ) response assign accord Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) RECIST guideline . Safety assess routine physical , laboratory ECG evaluation . Up 10 patient enrol study . Patients expect ( exclude unforeseen toxicity ) receive minimum 2 maximum 6 cycle Trisenox® . ( Patients least documented stable disease may eligible &gt; 6 cycle ) . Patients follow 6 month last dose Trisenox® . For trial would allow one prior cytotoxic regimen since time recurrence patient may one prior regimen part induction chemotherapy . Patients treat 0.25 mg/kg/day day 1-5 every 28 day patient may remain trial progression disease .</detailed_description>
