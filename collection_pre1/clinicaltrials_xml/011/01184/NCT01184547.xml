	<brief_summary>The purpose proposal ass efficacy implement 12-week structured supervise community-based exercise program ( COMBEX ) hospital discharge . The investigator assess effect exercise mental health physical function , along effect amelioration burn-induced catabolic response . The central hypothesis proposal exercise-induced physical psychosocial benefit obtain supervise structured COMBEX program severely burn adult improve physical function , quality life relative Standard Care ( SOC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Community Based Exercise Program Adults With Severe Burns</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current Standard Care physical rehabilitation burn individual discharge home prescribed write , physical occupational therapy rehabilitation activity . We believe supervise structured COMBEX program early recovery phase increase physical function , translate improvement QOL , produce result far superior current Standard Care . We intend study eliminate physical inactivity occur present standard care connect burn victim COMBEX . This also important since inactive lifestyle health risk factor even physically-able individual . Thus , fitter burn individual readily meet physical demand activity daily live . Activities daily live , whether occupational leisure , integrate function require cardiovascular muscle endurance muscle strength . Therefore , successful rehabilitation program need also optimize cardiopulmonary muscle endurance , strength function ; need exercise fulfill . Additionally , successful rehabilitation program improve QOL community engagement . Accordingly , present grant application , propose use exercise integral central interventional tool counteract physical dysfunction burn individual , thereby improve overall functional physical capacity , also prevent secondary condition result prolong maintain physical inactivity disability . Finally , increase physical capacity allow improvement QOL burn individual , evidence increase psychosocial response measure increased self-esteem , social interaction , return work , decrease anxiety depression . We propose improve current Standard Care incorporation community-based , supervise , structure aerobic resistive exercise rehabilitation program ( COMBEX ) . In addition , present grant proposal attempt bypass exercise train burn center translate community base facility . To knowledge , study prospective , randomized study exercise physiological psychosocial response aerobic resistance training quality life burn adult .</detailed_description>
