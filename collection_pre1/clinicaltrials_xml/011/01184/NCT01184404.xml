	<detailed_description>Rationale : Cardiac surgery relieve symptom increase life expectancy cardiac patient , without congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . However , cardiac surgery involve many risk complication , bleeding , arrhythmia , death . Right ventricular failure another complication , contribute poor clinical outcome . This clinical syndrome often difficult treat characterize edema , elevate jugular venous pressure , oliguria , hypotension , severe case shock , multi organ failure death . Patients increase risk develop post operative right ventricular failure CHD mitral valve lesion , elevate afterload . Other clinical factor contribute right ventricular failure mechanical pulmonary ventilation , pre-existing pulmonary hypertension cardiac surgery . Right ventricular failure due cardiac surgery cause cardiopulmonary bypass , reperfusion high partial pressure oxygen , air embolism , release cytokine . The endothelin-1 cytokine release cardiac surgery induces vasoconstriction pulmonary arteriole result right ventricular afterload elevation . Therefore , hypothesize treat patient endothelin-1 receptor antagonist improve clinical outcome , measure aerobic capacity ( peak V'O2 ) , decrease right ventricular afterload peri-operatively . Objective : To investigate whether endothelin-1 receptor antagonist improve aerobic capacity ( peak V'O2 ) adult CHD mitral valve lesion undergo cardiac surgery . Study design : A prospective randomize open label assessment blind end-points ( PROBE-design ) . Total duration study 18 week 6 week pre-operative 12 week post-operative treatment bosentan . Study population : Adults CHD undergo cardiac surgery patient undergo mitral valve surgery Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam . Patients randomize six week surgery . The study continue 12 week postoperatively . Intervention : The treatment group receive start dose 62.5 mg tablet bosentan twice daily four week follow 125 mg tablet bosentan twice daily two week prior 12 week surgery . The group receive study medication . Main study parameters/endpoints : 1 ) intensive care unit ) hemodynamics b ) Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) score c ) hour hospitalization 2 ) discharge right ventricular function ( assessed transthoracic echocardiography ) 3 ) six week post-operatively ) clinical condition exercise capacity ( peak V'O2 ) b ) right ventricular function ( assessed transthoracic echocardiography ) c ) quality life 4 ) twelve week post-operatively ) right ventricular function ( assessed transthoracic echocardiography ) b ) differences clinical status symptom</detailed_description>
