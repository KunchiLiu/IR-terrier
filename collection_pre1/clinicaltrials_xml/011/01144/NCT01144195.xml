	<brief_summary>First line chemotherapy treatment regimens metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) present disease-free survival 10 month , much 12 15 month many patient . It evident 2 group patient metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) : progress first line treatment 6 month follow last chemotherapy infusion progress first 6-month period . There currently study evaluate efficacy second line chemotherapy regimens accord duration response first line treatment . It seem logical patient less aggressive tumour benefit treatment target specific protein , panitumumab , due short duration tumour cell cycle , make less sensitive chemotherapy . This study therefore justify determine increase activity control disease patient progress 6 month last first line chemotherapy infusion metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) subject express wild-type KRAS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Panitumumab Combination With FOLFIRI Chemotherapy Second Line Treatment Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Expressing Wild-type KRAS Who Had Progressed ≥ 6 Months After Last Dose First Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , single-arm , multi-centre study . Patients metastatic colorectal cancer express wild type KRAS screen trial . KRAS mutation status assess inclusion WILD-TYPE-KRAS subject include . Eligible subject enrol treated combination therapy consist Panitumumab FOLFIRI second line treatment . Eligible patient must progress within 6 month receive first line chemotherapy base fluoropyrimidines oxaliplatin ( prior adjuvant chemotherapy base fluoropyrimidine permit ) . Only one previous chemotherapy regimen permit . Progression 6 month receive first line chemotherapy regimen , imaging-based . Tumor response assessment perform investigator per modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( m-RECIST ) . Subjects evaluate tumor response every 6 week ± 1 week first 24 week every 8 week thereafter ( per modified-RECIST criterion ) progression disease ( PD ) withdrawal trial . Responding disease confirm less 28 day criterion response first meet . Subjects symptoms suggestive progression disease ( PD ) evaluate tumor progression time symptom occur . All subject permanently discontinue treatment reason , undergo safety follow-up assessment 30 day ± 7 day last treatment dose Subjects follow disease status subsequent cancer therapy . All subject discontinue treatment disease progression ( eg , due unacceptable toxicity ) follow progression free survival ( PFS ) ( eg , radiographic tumor assessment ) every 12 week ± 14 day disease progression end study ( unless reason study discontinuation fully withdrawn consent ) . After disease progression , subject follow every 12 week ± 14 day safety follow-up visit end study ( approximately 52 week last subject enrol ) .</detailed_description>
