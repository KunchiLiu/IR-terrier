	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) common neurological disorder cause disability young adult . The management MS-patients require treatment disease-modifying agent , monoclonal antibody natalizumab immunosuppressant . Natalizumab show good efficacy approve treatment relapse MS number restriction due safety issue . Cognitive data related natalizumab treatment still scarce . Interferon-beta-1b approve high-frequency , subcutaneous ( sc ) administration treatment multiple sclerosis . It reduce relapse rate , severity , hospitalisation disease activity see MRI . This pilot study explore concept de-escalating natalizumab treatment interferon-beta-1b e.o.d compare continuous treatment natalizumab patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis previously treat natalizumab 12 month . The study design prospective , control , randomize , rater-blinded , parallel-group , two arm , mono-centric include patient Ticino Cohort . One arm treat Interferon-beta 1b 250mcg give subcutaneously every day , Natalizumab 300 mg give intravenously ( i.v . ) , every four week . The treatment duration 12 month , follow-up period 12 month . The time first on-study relapse compare treatment arm ( primary outcome ) . Other efficacy parameter include clinical radiological parameter , patient report outcome quality life fatigue . Safety assess report adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present , cure multiple sclerosis management MS-patients require treatment disease-modifying agent interferon-beta glatiramer acetate , monoclonal antibody natalizumab immunsuppressants mitoxantrone , azathioprine methotrexate . Acute relapse usually treat corticosteroid . Natalizumab humanize monoclonal antibody direct α4-integrin , component VLA-4 ( late antigen-4 ) present leukocyte . Following submission additional safety data , agency Swissmedic EMEA issue approval natalizumab treatment relapse MS number restriction . The preparation available Switzerland since 2006 . According current scientific information , natalizumab ( Tysabri® ) indicate `` disease-modifying monotherapy highly active relapse MS '' follow patient group : 1 ) patient show high level disease activity despite treatment IFN-β preparation , 2 ) untreated/treatment-naive patient rapidly progress relapsing-remitting MS ( least two serious relapse per year ) . The primary objective pilot study generate first data hypothesis concept de-escalating natalizumab-treated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patient interferon-beta-1b e.o.d compare continuous treatment natalizumab plan clinical study regard safety efficacy . As secondary objective , clinical , neuropsychological parameter , MRI laboratory parameter safety aspect assess accordance protocol available management patient natalizumab service . This prospective , control , randomize , rater-blinded , parallel-group , monocentric , two arm , phase IV pilot study . Patients relapsing-remitting form MS , respect inclusion/exclusion criterion , randomize two equal-size parallel arm de-escalation interferon beta-1b ( month wash-out ) continue treatment natalizumab . plan enrol 20 patient ( 1/2 natalizumab group , 1/2 interferon beta-1b group . Patients provide write informed consent treat 12 month ; pre-planned follow-up 12 month</detailed_description>
