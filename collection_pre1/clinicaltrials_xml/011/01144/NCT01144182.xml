	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) greatly increase mortality lower quality life ( QOL ) . HF common indication readmission old adult frequent reason 30-day readmission . Medications restriction dietary sodium constitute crucial therapy lower HF recurrence . However , adherence medication dietary recommendation low HF patient . Nonadherence often due interaction among environment , patient provider . In VALOR Heart Failure Study , ass novel quality improvement program ( QIP ) improve HF care use pretest-posttest design . This interdisciplinary theory-based prospective experimental study target improve HF treatment use patient-based behavioral checklist intervention , well provider system-targeted checklist treatment default ( posttest intervention phase ) ; compare current best practice ( CBP ) evaluate pretest ( pretest pre-intervention ) phase . It hypothesize QIP , intervenes patient , provider system level , improve QOL low HF recurrence compare CBP . The primary specific aim 1 ) To test effect QIP HF-specific quality life compare CBP group , 2 ) To evaluate impact QIP group general quality life compare CBP group . Secondary specific aim : 1 ) ass effect QIP medication adherence 3 month , 2 ) examine effect QIP diet adherence 3 month , 3 ) evaluate effect QIP satisfaction , 4 ) ass effect QIP intervention acceptability . We also examine impact QIP 3 month keep routine outpatient visit , health-care utilization , exercise capacity , weight , perceive stress , depression , cardiovascular event death . Exploratory aim examine effect QIP 30 day post-discharge HF readmission rate compare CBP . We enrol 136 veteran discharge hospital diagnosis HF . Patients enrol pretest phase receive HF management base current best practice ( CBP ) . Patients enrol posttest phase receive comprehensive quality improvement program ( QIP ) intervene patient , provider system level . The QIP consist 3 monthly phone call promote diet medication adherence use transtheoretical model behavioral framework checklist facilitate patient ' self-monitoring diet , physical activity , weight medication take . Further , provider posttest phase use checklists inpatient outpatient care HF patient . Data , include quality life ( QOL ) , medication adherence , dietary adherence , collect patient baseline ( prior hospital discharge ) 3 month . Hospital readmission , emergency room visit , healthcare utilization track 6 month . If , expect , difference demographic confounders ( EF , comorbidities , etc ) , pretest posttest group compare Fisher 's Exact test discrete outcome ( 30-day readmission ER visit ) . We use Student 's ttest ( two-tailed ) normally distribute outcome Wilcoxon rank-sum test categorical variable continuous variable normally distribute . This study inform enhance quality improvement effort heart failure care VA New York Harbor elsewhere . It also provide data rigorous effectiveness trial test promising intervention could reduce HF recurrence improve QOL HF . If promising theory-driven approach work clinical setting improvement HF care urgent , important scientific contribution .</detailed_description>
