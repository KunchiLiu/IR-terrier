	<brief_summary>The annual incidence neck pain report 14.6 % . Other study outline wide disparity lifetime incidence neck pain range 22 % 70 % . Numerous treatment option exist management neck pain however , limited evidence support intervention effective . Exercise base intervention commonly use treatment patient neck pain however ; clear patient likely benefit type treatment . The purpose project develop clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) identify patient neck pain great probability benefit standardized program education exercise . Ninety ( 90 ) patient refer physical therapy undergo standardize examination ass potential predictor variable . Upon completion examination standardize treatment program education exercise administer regardless examination finding . Self report measure administer initial examination follow visit 2 , 4 , 6 week . A questionnaire outcome measure also mail 6 month initiation treatment assess long-term change . Once treatment plan complete , patient classify either successful non-successful response . Subjects rat perceived recovery Global Rating Chance ( GROC ) `` great deal well '' , `` great deal well '' , `` quite bit well '' , `` moderately well '' ( i.e. , score +4 great ) categorize successful outcome . The primary endpoint determine outcome analyze 6 week 6 month . The result study assist physical therapist identify sub-groups patient likely benefit program education exercise . The categorization patient group base beneficial treatment may help provide improved outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sample size consist 90 subject age 18 primary complaint neck pain . The subject must able read communicate English order complete require documentation . No specific condition include would make protected population . Patients recruit one two way . First , flyer send local referral announce study request subject . Should patient interested participate call PI phone number list flyer . The PI inquire patient location coordinate convenient location . Second , patient present participate clinic primary complaint neck pain hand flyer ask front office would interest hear study . If patient express interest participate meet clinician train study review inclusion exclusion criterion . Should patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion , informed consent form review patient trained clinician . Once patient agree participate sign informed consent formally enrol study . All information obtain study strictly confidential unless disclosure require law . Federal Privacy Regulations provide safeguard privacy , security , authorized access . Except required law , patient identify name , social security number , address , telephone number , direct personal identifier . All record pertain patient 's involvement research study store lock file cabinet . A case number indicate patient 's identity record . This information accessible investigator list first page document research study staff . Methods Procedures This study follow standardized examination treatment protocol . All intervention technique proven effective patient population . Once patient deem eligible study inform consent review investigator . If patient agrees participate study sign inform consent . The patient complete self report measure take approximately 20 minute . Self report measure complete include neck disability index ( NDI ) , fear avoidance belief questionnaire ( FABQ ) , global rating change ( GROC ) , numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) . An investigator perform standardized examination take approximately 1 hour . Examination finding record cervical examination form . The patient give opportunity undergo second examination blind examiner reliability purpose . This second examination optional must perform within 48 hour treatment initiate . Upon completion examination patient issue home care guide include educational material standardize exercise program . The patient ask review educational information . When patient return follow visit standardize treatment program education exercise initiate progressed . Each subsequent treatment session last approximately one hour . The patient ask perform exercise program 2 time per week 6 week perform stretch independently . In order monitor progress self report measure complete every two week . When applicable , portion research cost associate physical therapy procedure bill patient 's insurance provider . The patient 's co-payments part research study . The procedure document medical/Research record . There additional cost patient outside normal delivery care payment offer patient participation study . Participants reimburse nominal amount time necessary complete research documentation . Subject reimbursement follow : Data Analysis Reliability examination variable assess blinded examiner second examination . Descriptive statistic calculate include frequency count categorical data calculation mean standard deviation ( SD ) continuous variable . Cohen k use calculate inter-rater reliability categorical data 2 response option possible . A weighted k use calculate reliability categorical data 3 response option . The weight k calculate use linear weight method . Intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) model 2,1 95 % confidence interval calculate determine inter-rater reliability continuous variable . The standard error measurement ( SEM ) calculate SD√ ( 1-r ) , SD standard deviation observe score r reliability coefficient measurement . The minimal detectable change ( MDC ) continuous variable calculate 1.96X SEM X √2 . The total measure error calculate continuous data mean difference raters ( rater A - rater B ) +/- 1.96 X SD . The total measure error represent value within 95 % measurement raters lie . Reliability categorical variable interpret follow ; value &lt; 0.10 agreement ; 0.11 0.40 slight agreement ; 0.41 0.60 fair agreement ; 0.61 0.80 moderate agreement value &gt; 0.81 substantial agreement . Reliability continuous variable interpret follow : &lt; 0.10 agreement ; 0.11 0.40 slight agreement ; 0.61 0.80 moderate agreement ; value &gt; 0.81 substantial agreement . Dependent t-tests use analyze primary outcome variable include Numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire - Physical Activity ( FABQ-PA ) Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire - Work ( FABQ-W ) . The alpha level set 0.05 . Multiple comparison conduct ( baseline - 2 week ; baseline - 4 week ; baseline - 6 week baseline - 6 month ) pair time frame dependent t-test . Bonferroni correction use establish significance level 0.0125 ( .05/4 ) . Potential predictor variable come outcome measure , demographic form , history physical assessment . Analysis implement use independent t-tests continuous variable X2 test categorical variable determine difference successful non-success outcome . Variables significance p &lt; .10 retain potential prediction variable group . This p value use decrease likelihood potential predictor variable miss . Sensitivity specificity value calculate continuous variable significant univariate relationship plot receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve . The point curve close upper leave corner represent value great diagnostic accuracy . This point select cutoff define positive test . Sensitivity , specificity likelihood ratio calculate retained variable successful non-successful group . Potential predictor variable group enter separate backward stepwise logistic regression model identify prudent group variable treatment outcome . Those variable preserve regression model use develop multivariate CPR classifying patient likely successful non-successful outcome complete program education exercise sample .</detailed_description>
