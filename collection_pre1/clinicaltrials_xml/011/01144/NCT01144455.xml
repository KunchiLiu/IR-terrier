	<brief_title>Study Safety Efficacy TH-302 Combination With Gemcitabine Compared With Gemcitabine Alone Previously Untreated Patients With Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A hypoxic microenvironment characteristic many solid tumor include pancreatic cancer . The presence hypoxia solid tumor associate malignant phenotype resistance chemotherapy . The hypoxia-activated prodrug , TH-302 , design selectively physiologically target hypoxic microenvironment . There absence therapeutic option subject metastatic pancreatic cancer . Gemcitabine provide clinical benefit single agent , median survival 6 month . Combining gemcitabine TH-302 may enable target normoxic hypoxic region pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
