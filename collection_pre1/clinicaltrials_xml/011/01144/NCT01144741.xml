	<brief_summary>Freeman-Sheldon syndrome ( FSS ) rare muscle disorder present birth , involve primarily problem face skull hand foot . This study problem , experience , helpful treatment , quality life focus patient FSS include patient Sheldon-Hall syndrome ( SHS ) , distal arthrogryposis type 1 ( DA1 ) , distal arthrogryposis type 3 ( DA3 ) , also call Gorden syndrome . These related disorder challenge treat , partly big difference individual patient lack information previous clinical experience treatment option . It hop study identify area research physiology therapy . This study cover type treatment [ medical ( non-surgical ) , include psychiatric , surgical treatment ] , even unconventional . It also include question effect patient 's thought , feeling , quality life , relationship sibling , family , parent ' intervention require advise . This study also look similarity difference patient meet head face part diagnostic criterion meet part patient meet full diagnostic criterion . There question problem experience investigate group patient may syndrome . Treatment success depend get correct diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study initiate research assistant ( Mikaela I. Poling ) assist another research assistant ( J. Andr√©s Morales ) , part academic project syndrome , supervision Principal Investigator ( Robert L Chamberlain ) . Classic FSS , SHS , DA1 , DA3 poorly understand pathological entity share similar physical finding FSS . Stevenson et al . ( 2006 ) provide study date FSS feature history . They , however , focus therapeutic outcome , limited anecdotal outcome data single multiple case report . The objective STOP-FSS follow : evaluate ( 1 ) physical finding , possible frequency cluster , complication physical finding amongst patient FSS ; ( 2 ) posttraumatic stress depressive symptom associate therapeutic outcome patient FSS , use single-disease specific ( i.e. , posttraumatic stress symptom , chronic depression ) measure ; ( 3 ) document treatment type outcomes ; ( 4 ) evaluate quality life patient FSS , use general quality life self-report measure syndrome-specific semi-structured quality life interview ; ( 5 ) educational attainment service use ; ( 6 ) evaluate diagnostic accuracy FSS SHS , use Stevenson criterion ; ( 7 ) evaluate possible difference patient meet full Stevenson criterion fulfil craniofacial part Stevenson criterion , without additional malformation . The following hypothesis thus propose . First , suggest physical finding frequency cluster similar previously report , complication physical finding amongst patient FSS , receive little attention literature , pronounce result nearly significant disease burden patient primary physical finding , e.g. , intercostal myopathy eventually lead right heart failure patient . Second , suggest FSS associate high rate posttraumatic stress symptom , depressive symptom observe general population . Third , suggest physiotherapy alone surgery expect superior surgery alone , especially patient FSS , treat problem , surgery may important role , especially treat blepharophimosis combination intensive pre- post-operative physiotherapy treat selective tendon lengthen hand foot . Fourth , suggest FSS associate reduce quality life observe general population . Fifth , suggest patient FSS neurocognitive feature receive appropriate academic service , frequently excel beyond family peer , also suggest patient FSS receive educational service responsive unique need ability , e.g. , placement 'special ' class school base patient 's appearance poorly conduct intelligence test . Sixth , suggest , base systematic review meta-analysis preliminary result , two-thirds patient state diagnosis FSS meet Stevenson criterion rediagnosed , mostly DA1 . Seventh , suggest , base systematic review meta-analysis preliminary result , two-thirds patient state diagnosis FSS meet Stevenson criterion , one-third meet craniofacial stipulates Stevenson criterion , without additional malformation , share natural history meet full Stevenson criterion .</detailed_description>
