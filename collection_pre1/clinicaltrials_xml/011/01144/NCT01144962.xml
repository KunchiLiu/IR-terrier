	<brief_title>Dose-escalating Therapeutic Study Allogeneic Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treatment Fistulas Patients With Refractory Perianal Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite introduction anti-TNFa ( tumor necrosis factor alpha ) therapy , perianal disease still account high rate morbidity patient diagnosed CD . Recently , phase II multicenter randomize study report show expand adipose tissue derive mesenchymal stem cell ( atMSCs ) combination fibrin glue effective safe treatment complex perianal fistula . However , dose escalation allogeneic bone marrow ( bm ) MSCs local treatment perianal fistula study . In study , three escalate dos test total three cohort . MSC implantation precede surgical localization , curettage fistulous tract closure internal opening . Per cohort , patient randomize 5:2 fashion receive either 10x10^6 ( cohort 1 ) , 30x10^6 ( cohort 2 ) 90x10^6 ( cohort 3 ) bmMSCs cell ( control group ) . The primary endpoint assess week 12 : ) number adverse serious adverse event ii ) reduction number drain fistula , define absence discharge absence collection â‰¥2 cm directly relate treat fistulas tract measure MRI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman &gt; 18 year age Patient must CD ( least 3 month time initial diagnosis ) . The diagnosis CD must confirm endoscopic histologic evidence CDAI score &lt; 250 screen baseline Perianal fistula must refractory conventional medical therapy Which mean time course disease , patient must receive steroid immunosuppressive agent ( example , azathioprine , 6mercaptopurine ( 6MP ) , methotrexate , infliximab ) result adequate response treatment Patients previous surgical attempt eradicate perianal fistula eligible inclusion patient seton situ . Setons remove surgical procedure Patients include study might receive 5aminosalicylic acid ( 5ASA ) , steroid , azathioprine , 6MP , methotrexate , similar drug time enrolment allow history infliximab treatment , provide following condition fulfil screening : The dose 5ASA ( oral rectal ) must stable least 4 week prior enrollment The dose steroid must stable least 4 week prior enrollment The dose immunosuppressant ( example azathioprine , 6MP , methotrexate ) must stable least 8 week prior enrollment patient therapy least three month prior enrollment The last dose infliximab antiTNF drug &gt; 8 week prior enrollment No need immediate surgery ( obstruction , strictures abscess ) If female childbearing age , patient must nonpregnant nonbreastfeeding , use adequate contraception Patient willing participate study sign informed consent . Consent must obtain prior study procedure Patients evidence acute perianal infection , presence perianal abscess large 2 cm , anal rectal stricture Patients evidence infection need antibiotic treatment Rectovaginal fistula , complex perianal fistula two internal opening Patients suffer renal hepatic failure Use investigational drug within 1 month prior screen within 5 halflives investigational agent , whichever longer Patient allergic gadolinium ( MRI contrast agent ) Patient severe renal insufficiency define patient glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 . GFR = 186.3 x ( serum creatinine ) 1.154 x ( age year ) 0.203 x 1.212 ( patient black ) x 0.742 ( female ) Due high strength electromagnetic field use MRI risk interference metallic implant body . The following condition disqualify patient MRI exclude study : Electronically , magnetically , mechanically activated implant Ferromagnetic electronically operate stapedial implant Cardiac pacemakers/carotid sinus pacemaker implant Hemostatic clip Metallic splinter orbit Insulin pump nerve stimulators Lead wire similar wire Metal intrauterine device Change concomitant medication : Steroids must stable least 4 week prior enrollment 5ASA stable dose &gt; 4 week prior enrollment Immunosuppressants ( e.g . azathioprine , 6MP methotrexate ) stable dose &gt; 8 week prior enrolment Infliximab antiTNF antibody therapy administer &lt; 8 week prior enrollment Claustrophobia Documented HIV ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus ) infection . Active hepatitis B , hepatitis C TB Patients currently opportunistic infection ( e.g. , herpes zoster [ shingle ] , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis carinii , aspergillosis , histoplasmosis , mycobacteria TB ) within 6 month prior screen Serious infection ( pneumonia pyelonephritis ) previous 3 month . Less serious infection ( acute upper respiratory tract infection [ cold ] simple urinary tract infection ) need consider exclusion discretion investigator Malignancy within past 5 year ( except squamous basal cell carcinoma skin treat evidence recurrence ) History lymphoproliferative disease include lymphoma Patient unwilling unable comply study procedure</criteria>
