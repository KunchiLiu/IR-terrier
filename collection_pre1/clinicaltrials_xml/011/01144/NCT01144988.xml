	<brief_summary>Malignant glioma common aggressive primary brain tumor adult . Despite advance multimodal treatment include surgery , radiation chemotherapy , patient dismal prognosis 9-15 month ( Stupp et al. , NEJM 2005 ) . A major reason aggressiveness malignant glioma pronounce tumor neovascularization , mainly drive vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor . The therapeutic monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) inhibit VEGF pathway bind VEGF ligand . In Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) treatment reduces contrast enhancement restoring , blood-brain-barrier destabilized vessel integrity . Furthermore , raise sensitivity co-administered chemotherapeutics Irinotecan . In conclusion , anti-angiogenic therapy lead problem routinely use MRI technique distinguish anti-vascular effect true anti-tumor effect . The study hypothesis clinical trial part 35 % malignant glioma patient Avastin / Irinotecan chemotherapy result objective tumor response assess standard / functional MRI FET- /FLT-PET neuroimaging . The study hypothesis translational study part expression molecular target Avastin Irinotecan malignant glioma tissue ( = tumor vascular cell ) predictive Avastin / Irinotecan therapy induce treatment response measure functional MRI FET- / FLT-PET imaging .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients present first second tumor recurrence / progression histological confirm supratentorial malignant glioma WHO Grade IIIIV ( Classification follow WHO criterion ) . 2 . Patients surgical resection tumor recurrence / progression : Following standard therapy ( first recurrence ) standard therapy / second line chemotherapy ( second recurrence , except antiangiogenic approach ) patient must evidence tumor progression measure standard MRI sequence ( MacDonald criterion ) . If possible , patient may prior surgical resection tumor progression eligible follow condition apply : Patients must recover effect surgery To adequately asses malignant glioma surgery extent residual disease postoperatively , two MRIs scan perform : A first standard MRI scan do within 1 week surgery document progress recurrent malignant glioma . A second standard / functional MRI scan do 24 48 hour surgery document postoperative malignant glioma ( Baseline MRI scan ) . FET / FLTPET scan do within 2 week surgery document postoperative malignant glioma ( Baseline PET scan ) . Patients without surgical resection tumor recurrence / progression : Patients must evidence tumor progression measure standard MRI sequence ( MacDonald criterion ) . Additional functional MRI sequence do within 1 week prior study enrollment . FET / FLTPET scan do within 2 week surgery document postoperative malignant glioma ( Baseline PET scan ) . 3 . Resolution acute toxic effect prior therapy grade ≤ 1 ( except alopecia ) 4 . Patients must ECOG performance status 02 5 . Patients must ≥ 18 year ≤ 80 year age , life expectancy great 8 week 6 . Patients must adequate organ function define follow criterion : Bone Marrow Reserve Platelets ≥ 75.000/μL Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1500/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dL Blood Coagulation aPTT ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Hepatic Function ASAT ALAT ≤ 2.5 time ULN ALP ≤ 2.5 time ULN Total SERUM Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time ULN Renal Function SERUM Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN Metabolism SERUM Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL All test must perform ≤ 3 day prior study enrollment . Eligibility hemoglobin count may reach transfusion . 7 . Signed date informed consent document patient , indicate patient inform pertinent aspect trial prior study enrollment . 8 . Willingness ability patient comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 9 . The patient active participant another clinical trial , investigate substance antiangiogenic effectiveness 10 . Exclusion patient event surgery recurrent / progress malignant glioma within 2 week prior study enrollment chemotherapy ( Standard therapy Second Line Chemotherapy ) within 2 week prior study enrollment radiation therapy ( Standard therapy ) within4 week study enrollment evidence baseline MRI intratumoral peritumoral hemorrhage deem clinically significant treat physician ( area hemorrhage &gt; 25 % tumor area ) 11 . Significant CoMorbidities within 12 month prior study enrollment myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina pectoris , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , congestive heart failure cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack 12 . Significant CoMorbidities Baseline Evaluation Hypertension control medication ( &gt; 150/100 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy ) Pulmonary embolism within 4 week study enrollment A known HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) Hepatitis B/C infection severe acute infection 13 . Anticoagulation : Current treatment therapeutic dos Marcoumar / Sintrom exclude thrombosis prophylaxis low dose Heparin 14 . Pregnancy , Breastfeeding NonContraception Female patient pregnant nursing Patients sexually active unwilling unable use medically acceptable method contraception trial 15 . Evidence increase intracranial pressure midline shift &gt; 5 mm headache , distinct nausea vomit 16 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality would impart excess risk associate study participation study drug administration , would make patient inappropriate entry study .
