	<brief_title>Study Hydroxychloroquine Before Surgery Patients With Primary Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autophagy cellular survival mechanism protect stress-induced programmed death . Autophagy may enable renal cancer escape cytokine therapy , cytotoxic chemotherapy target agent . Hydroxychloroquine prevent autophagy block acidification lysosome , study clinical trial mean enhance cancer therapy . This phase Ib clinical trial test hypothesis pre-operative exposure HC reduce biologic marker autophagy peripheral blood , normal kidney renal cancer specimen obtain time nephrectomy . These data use design pharmacodynamic monitoring future therapeutic trial HC combination high dose interleukin-2 systemic therapy advance RCC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects suspect primary metastatic RCC ( stage 1IV ) plan nephrectomy partial nephrectomy . ECOG performance status ≤1 Normal renal , hepatic , hematologic function time enrollment evidence : Serum creatinine level ≤1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum total bilirubin level ≤1.5 X ULN White blood cell count &gt; = 3.5x109/ml per ml platelet count ≥ 100x109 per ml Age &gt; 18 year . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Subjects receive chemotherapy diagnosis within 12 month prior study entry . Prior use radiotherapy investigational agent RCC . Concurrent malignancy evidence active measurable disease except nonmelanoma skin cancer Inability adhere study and/or followup procedure History allergic reaction hypersensitivity study drug ( hydroxychloroquine ) current therapy study drug reason . Other concurrent experimental therapy . The effect HC develop human fetus unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . All female childbearing potential must blood test urine study within two week prior registration rule pregnancy . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . If man impregnate woman participate study , inform treat physician immediately well . HIVpositive patient exclude study . However , patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy , potential impact pharmacokinetic interaction HC unknown . Therefore , HIVpositive patient actively receive antiretroviral therapy exclude study . Patients psoriasis ineligible unless disease well control care specialist agree monitor patient exacerbation . Patients require use enzymeinducing antiepileptic medication include : phenytoin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , primidone oxcarbazepine exclude . Hydroxychloroquine know affect CYP2D6 metabolic pathway . A list drug potential interaction include Appendix H. Patients previously document macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy exclude . Patients know glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase ( GP6D ) deficiency EKG QTc &gt; 500 msec baseline ( average 3 determination 10 minute interval ) . Subjects ventricular pacemaker QT interval measurable eligible casebycase basis .</criteria>
