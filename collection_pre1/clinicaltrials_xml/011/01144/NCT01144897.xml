	<brief_summary>One purpose research study examine special type image test , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan use radioactive material [ C-11 ] acetate , helpful detect prostate cancer lesion subject castrate-resistant prostate cancer . This PET scan combine compute tomography ( CT ) scan take imaging session . The purpose PET-CT scan use [ C-11 ] acetate ( PET Acetate Scan ) assist identify respond treatment ( docetaxel chemotherapy ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Ability understand willingness sign write consent document . 2 . Patients must histologically document adenocarcinoma prostate time past . 3 . At time enrollment : Patients must evidence castrate resistant metastatic prostate cancer ( patient rise PSA radiographic evidence metastatic prostate cancer eligible ) . In addition , progressive disease require per # 5 . 4 . Two category eligible patient exist : Measurable disease level serum prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) OR Nonmeasurable disease ( positive bone scan ) PSA equal great 2 ng/ml Definition Measurable Disease/Target Lesions Any lesion &gt; /= 1 cm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) believe represent metastatic prostate cancer accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter ) . However , lesion lymph node , need equal great 20 mm ( long diameter ) base CT scan physical exam ( palpable lymph node ) . Chest Xray clearly define lung lesion surround aerated lung parenchymal lung lesion measure 10 mm great spiral CT also eligible . Definition Nonmeasurable Disease/Nontarget Lesions Nontarget lesion include lesion include , include bone lesion . Previously irradiated lesion use eligibility unless progression document radiation therapy . 5 . In order eligible , patient must demonstrate evidence progressive disease prior enrollment . Progressive disease define one following : Measurable Disease Progression : Objective evidence increase 20 % sum long diameter ( LD ) target lesion time maximal regression prior therapy ; appearance one new lesion . Bone Scan Progression : Appearance two new lesion bone scan . If prior bone scan exists , presence 2 lesion need eligibility . PSA Progression : An elevated PSA ( 2 ng/mL high ) rise serially least two occasion least 1 week apart . Note : If patient antiandrogens last therapy , 6 week need elapse discontinuation antiandrogen . For prior ketoconazole , 4 week need elapse . If confirmatory PSA ( # 2 ) value less first rise PSA value , additional rising PSA ( # 3 ) require document progression . For purpose study , last PSA value record prior initiation treatment consider baseline PSA . 6 . Progression despite standard androgen deprivation therapy . 7 . At least 4 week since systemic steroid ( dose ; unless use chronically another illness equal le 10 mg prednisone daily , conjunction prior ketoconazole result slow steroid taper ) hormonal therapy . 8 . No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy prostate cancer . 9 . Four week longer since major surgery fully recover . 10 . Four week longer since prior radiation ( include palliative ) fully recover . 11 . No prior strontium samarium . 12 . Concurrent bisphosphonate use allow . However , patient previously bisphosphonate , first dose occur baseline positron emission tomography ( PET ) acetate scan obtain . 13 . ECOG performance status : 02 14 . Age ≥ 18 15 . Required Initial Laboratory Values ( within 14 day registration ) : ANC ≥1500/microL ; Platelet count ≥ 100,000/microL ; Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ; AST ALT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ; PSA level requirement : see # 4 ; Serum Testosterone ≤ 50 ng/ dL ( patient bilateral orchiectomy ) ; Estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 30 mL/min 1 . No known brain metastasis ( brain image MRI/CT require unless clinical symptom ) . 2 . No current congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) . 3 . No serious nonhealing wound , ulcer bone fracture . 4 . No peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2 . 5 . Patients know hypersensitivity Chinese hamster ovary cell product recombinant human antibody eligible . 6 . Patients receive prior docetaxel reason eligible . 7 . PCSpes , Saw Palmetto , St. John 's Wort must discontinue registration . The discontinuation herbal medication food supplement strongly encourage . Patients may continue daily vitamin calcium supplement . 8 . No known allergy acetate . 9 . No severe claustrophobia 10 . Concurrent use statins allow study use start 30 day prior entry study</criteria>
