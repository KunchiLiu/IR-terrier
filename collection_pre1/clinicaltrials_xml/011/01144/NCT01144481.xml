	<detailed_description>Bone common site distant breast cancer recurrence , 65-75 % woman advance breast cancer develop bone metastasis course disease . Bone metastases significantly adversely impact quality life cause pain skeletal related event ( SREs ) pathological fracture , surgery/radiotherapy pain/prevention fracture , hypercalcemia , spinal cord compression . These complication bone metastasis may necessitate multiple medical , surgical , radiation intervention . Indeed , prior widespread use bisphosphonates , two third ( 2/3 ) woman bone metastasis develop least one SRE . Despite prolonged bisphosphonate use , many patient continue progression bone metastases develop SREs . The pressing problem management bony metastasis today , inability reliably identify patient high risk SREs despite standard bisphosphonate use . Using prospective , observational trial design , develop prognostic model baseline serum C-telopeptide ( sCTx ) predictor variable SREs outcome variable . 60 breast cancer patient metastases site approached participation prospective single center study . Baseline characteristic ( potential risk factor ) record upon study enrollment , include clinical factor ( prior fragility fracture , use corticosteroid , age ) , bone mineral density , performance status , measure quality life pain . Novel marker sCTx bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( bALP ) also assess . The WHO fracture risk assessment tool ( http : //www.shef.ac.uk ) use estimate baseline fracture risk accord osteoporosis guideline calcium intake diet history take . In addition , assessment vertebral fracture take place use two novel technique , bone densitometric vertebral fracture assessment ( VFA ) high resolution quantitative CT ( HR-pQCT ) . Bone mineral density along VFA perform baseline one year treatment . Patients assess every twelve week twenty-four month regard : symptom related SREs , ECOG status , pain ( use BPI , 7-point scale analgesic use ) , quality life ( use FACT-BP , FACT-BTSQ ) . In addition measure baseline , sCTx bALP measure every twelve week twenty-four month . Calcium 25-hydroxy vitamin D measure annually part regular clinical practice , CT scan thorax abdomen well bone scan preform least yearly part regular clinical practice patient metastatic breast cancer . Using late innovation image medical biomarkers , novel pilot project develop prospective risk model predict bone metastasis , able identify patient would benefit novel treatment , multikinase inhibitor Zactima Src inhibitor , AZD0530 .</detailed_description>
