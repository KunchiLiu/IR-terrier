	<brief_title>Hair Cortisol Testosterone Levels Patients With Without Acute Myocardial Infarction ( MI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently grow interest measure hair cortisol testosterone level . Hair grow approximately 1 centimeter per month , hair analysis accurately reflect long-term endogenous production hormone . The association elevate hair cortisol level chronic stress report several study . Furthermore , recently demonstrate high hair cortisol level patient admit acute myocardial infarction compare patient admit indication ( manuscript recently submit publication ) . Nevertheless still clear whether hair cortisol level risk factor acute coronary event chronic cardiovascular disease . In order address issue , comparison hair cortisol level patient acute MI control group patient chronic cardiovascular disease need . Several study report endogenous testosterone concentration inversely associate cardiovascular mortality progression atherosclerosis coronary peripheral artery . However study use single serum testosterone level therefore may accurately represent chronic endogenous production hormone . It may association testosterone level cardiovascular disease may well evaluate use hair technique . Nevertheless association study yet . Aim study : To compare hair cortisol testosterone level patient admit acute MI stable patient prior cardiovascular disease diabetes patient history cardiovascular disease . Secondary endpoint : To evaluate association hair cortisol testosterone burden coronary atherosclerosis . The latter quantified AMI patient undergo coronary angiography assess non culprit coronary artery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>General : Males Age &gt; 30 Cases : Patients acute MI ( elevate cardiac enzyme + chest pain typical ECG change ) Control group 1 : Will include patient least 1 following : Prior cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . CVD define history hospital admission due acute coronary artery occlusion , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , coronary artery bypass grafting , aortic peripheral vascular disease either symptomatic require intervention , ischemic hemorrhagic stroke transient ischemic attack . Diabetes mellitus . ( Defined report patient appear medical record , patient receive regular treatment oral hypoglycemic agent insulin ) Control group 2 : Patients without prior cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus ( see definition ) . Corticosteroid treatment last 12 month . Diagnosis Cushing 's Addison 's disease . Diagnosed hypogonadism treat testosterone Dyed hair . Inability sign inform consent . Any hospital admission 6 month prior enrolment Morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 )</criteria>
