	<brief_title>The Influence Local Bone Status Complications After Surgical Treatment Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite fracture wrist widely regard `` fragility fracture '' , good evidence cause diminished Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) low BMD value predict high fracture risk distal radius . Both measurement areal BMD DXA volumetric BMD peripheral Quantitative Computer Tomography ( pQCT ) show low BMD woman Colles ' fracture . Thus , Colles ' fracture recognize good indication underlie osteoporosis . High resolution peripheral Quantitative Computer Tomography distal radius evaluate subset patient . Clinical expert concerned osteoporosis increase risk poor outcome complication rate surgical patient osteoporosis . However , yet confirm clinical study . It important investigate question order correctly advise clinicians patient possibly develop tailored approach treatment osteoporotic patient distal radius fracture .</detailed_description>
