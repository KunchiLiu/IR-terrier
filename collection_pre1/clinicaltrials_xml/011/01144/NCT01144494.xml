	<brief_title>Aqueous Humor Dynamics Brimonidine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , investigator-masked , crossover study design investigate circadian rhythm aqueous humor dynamic human subject ocular hypertension ( OHT ) intervention commonly use ocular hypotensive medication , brimonidine . Thirty volunteer ocular hypertension ( intraocular pressure great 20mmHg ) enrol . The subject undergo baseline phase medication phase use brimonidine . At phase , attend daytime nighttime study visit fluorophotometry use calculate aqueous flow ( production ) , trabecular outflow facility , uveoscleral outflow . At completion study , subject return previous ophthalmic clinic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must 19 year age old Subjects must exhibit history untreated IOPs 21 35 mmHg ( inclusive ) Age less nineteen year old Women pregnant , lactate childbearing potential use birth control measure . Aphakia pseudophakia Best correct visual acuity worse 20/60 either eye Chronic recurrent severe ocular inflammatory disease Ocular infection inflammation within ( 3 ) month screen visit . History clinically significant progressive retinal disease retinal degeneration , diabetic retinopathy retinal detachment . Any abnormality prevent reliable tonometry either eye . Previous exposure : betaadrenergic antagonist , topical prostaglandin analogue within six ( 6 ) week baseline visit ; Î±adrenergic agonist within two ( 2 ) week baseline visit ; cholinergic agonist carbonic anhydrase inhibitor within five ( 5 ) day treatment initiation visit . History severe ocular pathology ( include severe dry eye ) would prelude administration topical beta blocker , carbonic anhydrase inhibitor , topical prostaglandin . Any eye cuptodisc ratio great 0.8 . History intraocular surgery History ocular laser surgery History severe serious hypersensitivity brimonidine vehicle .
