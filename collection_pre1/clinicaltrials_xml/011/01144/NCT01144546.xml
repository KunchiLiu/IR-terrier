	<brief_summary>Hypotension frequently occur anesthesia induction . Preload decrease anesthetic often consider one main cause hypotension . However , study topic lack . Dynamic preload index suitable static preload index predict effect preload change . And , recently , passive leg raise test show successful result predict fluid responsiveness patient spontaneous ventilation . The investigator hypothesize hypotension induction anesthesia cause decrease preload anesthetic passive leg raise test could predict hypotension . In study , investigator try evaluate whether passive leg raise induced hemodynamic change could predict hypotension anesthesia induction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Passive Leg Raising Test Predict Hypotension During Induction Anesthesia Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In randomize controlled clinical trial , investigator hypothesize passive leg raise induced change hemodynamic parameter could predict hypotension anesthesia induction . To evaluate , anesthesia , investigator conduct passive leg raise test . At first , patient 's trunk elevate 45 degree first set measurement . Then , low limb raise 45Â° angle patient 's trunk lower supine position measure peak CO ( usually within 1-2 min ) . Hemodynamic profile plan measure mean arterial pressure , heart rate , cardiac index , stoke volume stroke volume variation . After , occurrence hypotension ( systolic blood pressure &lt; 90mmHg mean arterial pressure decrease &gt; 30 % baseline ) record time anesthesia induction surgical skin incision . Hypotension treat standardized method . If heart rate ( HR ) less 70 beats/min , 5mg ephedrine administer HR great 70 beats/min , 30 mcg phenylephrine administer . This repeated hypotension subside . Refractory hypotension define continuous hypotension despite total infused dose ephedrine &gt; 0.5 mg/kg phenylephrine &gt; 4 mcg/kg . The ability predict hypotension refractory hypotension anesthesia induction passive leg raise test evaluate receiver operate characteristic curve analysis .</detailed_description>
