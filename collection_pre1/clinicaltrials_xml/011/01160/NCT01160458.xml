	<brief_summary>Background : Background : - IMC-A12 , new cancer treatment yet approve U.S. Food Drug Administration , antibody design block effect protein call Type I Insulin-Like Growth Factor ( IGF-1R ) . IMC-A12 block receptor cell respond IGF-1R , think play important role help cancer cell grow divide . Researchers interested determine whether IMC-A12 effective treatment individual mesothelioma respond standard chemotherapy . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness IMC-A12 treatment individual mesothelioma previously chemotherapy . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose mesothelioma respond chemotherapy . Design : - Eligible participant screen full physical examination medical history , blood urine sample , image study . - Participants receive IMC-A12 every 3 week ( 21-day cycle ) , evaluate start new cycle blood test image study need . - Treatment cycle continue long need , unless severe side effect develop disease progress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study IMC-A12 Patients With Mesothelioma Who Have Been Previously Treated With Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Platinum-based chemotherapy standard care advance unresectable malignant mesothelioma . New option treatment necessary patient advanced disease progress platinum-based therapy . The insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) pathway study various malignancy include mesothelioma . IMC-A12 anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody show activity patient various malignancy . Objectives : Primary Objective : - To determine clinical response rate ( partial response ( PR ) +complete response ( CR ) ) IMC-A12 monotherapy patient advance mesothelioma . Secondary Objectives : - To determine response duration , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . - To assess safety IMC-A12 patient mesothelioma Exploratory Objectives : - To evaluate tumor IGF-1R expression correlation response - To correlate response therapy change fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) imaging . - To monitor serum mesothelin cancer antigen 125 carbohydrate antigen 125 ( CA-125 ) level prior therapy . Eligibility : - Patients histologically confirm malignant pleural peritoneal mesothelioma previously treat least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen progressive disease document prior study entry , refuse cytotoxic chemotherapy . - Measurable disease modify Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria pleural mesothelioma RECIST criterion peritoneal mesothelioma . - Adequate renal , hepatic hematopoietic function . - No major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy biologic therapy within 28 day IMC-A12 therapy Design : - Patients receive IMC-A12 dose 20 mg/kg intravenously every three week . - Treatment IMC-A12 alone continue disease progression . - Toxicity assess every cycle Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) Version 4.0 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . - Tumor response assessment perform every 2 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects must histologically confirm pleural peritoneal mesothelioma amenable potentially curative surgical resection . The diagnosis confirm pathology department / Center Cancer Research ( CCR ) / National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . 2 . Patients must least one prior platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . 3 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . 4 . Patients must major surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , biologic therapy ( include investigational agent ) , hormonal therapy ( replacement ) , within 4 week prior enter study must evidence stable progressive disease eligible . 5 . Age great equal 18 year . Since mesothelioma extremely rare child exclude study . 6 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 7 . Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) less equal 2 . 8 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function ( define ) . leukocytes great equal 3,000/mm^3 absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mm^3 hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL platelet great equal 100,000/ mm^3 total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 3 time institutional ULN ( 5 time liver function test ( LFT ) elevation due liver metastasis ) creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Patients may transfuse obtain hemoglobin great equal 9 g/Dl . 9 . The patient must fast serum glucose &lt; 160 mg/dL 10 . The effect IMCA12 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study therapy 3 month last dose IMCA12 . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . While hormonal method birth control effective , ask female patient participate study cease hormonal form birth control , method birth control ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) may affect study drug . Patients must hormonal form birth control least 4 week prior initiate study . 11 . Ability comply intravenous administration schedule , ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial . Every effort make recruit woman minority study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 3 month without steroid may enrol discretion principal investigator . 2 . Patients poorly control diabetes mellitus . Patients history diabetes mellitus allow participate , provide blood glucose 160 mg/dL fast stable dietary therapeutic regimen condition HbA1C le 7 % . 3 . Uncontrolled medical illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( American Heart Association ( AHA ) Class II worse ) , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 4 . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient poorly control viral load ( viral load &gt; 50 copy HIV/ml ) , and/or acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define illness exclude due possibility IMCA12 may worsen condition likelihood underlying condition may obscure attribution adverse event respect IMCA12 . HIV positive patient mesothelioma meet criterion consider inclusion study . 5 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 6 . History another invasive malignancy last five year . Adequately treated noninvasive , nonmelanoma skin cancer well situ carcinoma cervix allow . 7 . Prior treatment drug IGF1R inhibitor class . 8 . Patients tumor amenable potentially curative therapy assess investigator . In patient peritoneal mesothelioma prior surgery , surgical consultation obtain see patient candidate debulking surgery . 9 . Pregnant woman exclude study IMCA12 monoclonal antibody IGF1R potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibody may also potentially secrete milk therefore breastfeeding woman exclude . Because potential teratogenic abortifacient effect woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method ) , study period 3 month last dose investigational agent . 10 . Patients must hormonal form birth control hormone replacement therapy , may affect study drug . Patients must hormonal form birth control hormone replacement therapy least 4 week prior initiate study . 11 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition IMCA12 .</criteria>
