	<brief_title>A Study Compare Safety Efficacy Aromatase Inhibitor Combination With Lapatinib , Trastuzumab Both Treatment Hormone Receptor Positive , HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , open-label , multi-center , three arm study lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) , trastuzumab plus AI , lapatinib plus AI evaluate efficacy safety regimens first- second-line therapy postmenopausal subject hormone receptor positive ( HR+ ) , HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) receive prior trastuzumab endocrine therapy . Eligible subject postmenopausal ; tumor ER and/or PgR positive HER2-positive ; Stage IV metastatic breast cancer . The primary objective demonstrate superiority lapatinib/trastuzumab/AI combination versus ( vs. ) trastuzumab/AI combination progression free survival . The secondary objective evaluate progression free survival trastuzumab/AI vs. lapatinib/AI trastuzumab/lapatinib/AI vs. lapatinib/AI , overall survival , overall response rate , clinical benefit rate , safety tolerability three treatment group ( lapatinib plus trastuzumab plus AI , trastuzumab plus AI , lapatinib plus AI ) , quality life status relative baseline .</detailed_description>

Subject must receive least one prior regimen contain trastuzumab combination chemotherapy breast cancer : . Subject ONLY receive prior trastuzumab combination chemotherapy neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment . OR Subject receive ONE prior trastuzumabcontaining regimen metastatic disease ( progress ) , may may receive prior trastuzumab combination chemotherapy neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment . 7 . Subject must receive prior endocrine therapy ( aromatase inhibitor selective estrogen receptor modulators ) . 8 . Subjects life expectancy &gt; 6 month assess treat investigator 9 .
