	<brief_title>Plerixafor Clofarabine Frontline Treatment Elderly Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Plerixafor design block protein cancer cell attach cell bone marrow . This may allow cell bone marrow effectively treat chemotherapy . Clofarabine design interfere growth development cancer cell . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 3 group 6 participant enrol Part 1 portion study , 48 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose plerixafor receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level plerixafor . Each new group receive high dose plerixafor group , intolerable side effect see . If enrol Part 2 , receive plerixafor high dose tolerate Part 1 . All participant receive dos clofarabine . Study Drug Administration : Cycles study 28 day long , possibly longer depend blood count , side effect , status disease . On Days 1-5 cycle , receive plerixafor needle skin abdomen . On Days 1-5 cycle , receive clofarabine vein 1 hour . The dose begin 4 6 hour plerixafor injection . You watch side effect receive clofarabine . If doctor think best interest , dose level plerixafor may lower . Cycle 1 call Induction . If disease go remission ( respond well ) Induction cycle , start Consolidation part study . In Consolidation cycle , schedule administration drug Induction cycle , dose clofarabine lower . If disease go remission Induction cycle , Reinduction cycle begin Consolidation part study . The goal Induction cycle possible Reinduction cycle affect bone marrow certain way may help control disease . The goal Consolidation also help control disease . Study Visits : Induction ( Cycle 1 ) : On Day 1 Induction , blood ( ½ tablespoon time ) drawn routine test plerixafor injection 3 time 8 hour injection . On Days 2-5 Induction , blood ( ½ tablespoon time ) drawn routine test plerixafor injection 8 hour injection . Starting Week 2 Induction , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw least 2 time week routine test . You bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease Day 21 Induction every 2 week , Induction cycle . Reinduction : If Reinduction cycle , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw least 2 time week Reinduction routine test . You bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease Day 21 Reinduction every 2 week , Reinduction cycle . Consolidation : Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw 1 time day routine test Days 1-5 Consolidation . Starting Week 2 Consolidation cycle , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test every week rest Consolidation cycle . You bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease anytime Consolidation doctor decides need . Induction , Reinduction , Consolidation : The blood test and/or bone marrow aspirations/biopsies may perform often list doctor think need . Also , ECG anytime study doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug 5 Consolidation cycle , doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visits : At 1 3 month stop take study drug : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor decides need , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . If disease responds ( go complete partial remission ) , follow-up visit every 3 month 2 year stop take study drug . The follow-up visit stop disease get bad , start new cancer therapy disease gotten bad . The following test procedure perform follow-up visit : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor decides need , bone marrow aspiration check status disease . This investigational study . Clofarabine FDA approve commercially available treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) child disease gotten bad second time . Plerixafor FDA approve give G-CSF commercially available use move stem cell bloodstream stem cell transplant treat non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma multiple myeloma . The combination clofarabine plerixafor investigational . Up 66 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
