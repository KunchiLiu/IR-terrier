	<brief_summary>High mammographic density ( HMD ) strong risk factor non-familial breast cancer apart age gender . Studies sister twin suggest approximately 67 % variation density attributable common genetic factor . However , date , effort identify genetic determinant HMD achieve limited success . We others ( Boyd et al Lancet Oncol 2009 ) postulate lack progress identify genetic determinant density relate failure study young woman misclassification density . As woman age , breast tissue undergo atrophy , manifest radiologically decrease mammographic density , result convergence density value mask inter-person variation . This protocol intend demonstrate feasibility method plan use full-scale analysis mammographic density among woman age 50 year receive care University Vermont , Fletcher Allen Health Care ( FAHC ) follow Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System ( VBCSS ) . The Hormonal Reproductive Epidemiology Branch ( HREB ) currently conduct cross-sectional study entitle , Breast Radiology Evaluation Study Tissues ( BREAST ) Stamp Project aim understand mammographically dense tissue relate elevate breast cancer risk . This project conduct within VBCSS use breast cancer awareness Stamp Act fund . The BREAST Stamp project focus woman age 40-65 year refer radiologically-guided biopsy evaluate abnormality identify screen mammogram . The study successfully enrol 400 woman collection questionnaire , buccal blood sample , tissue . The study continue recruit May 2010 , target enrollment 450-500 woman . Through infrastructure develop BREAST Stamp Project , mammographic volumetric density data , assess use novel method density phantom develop UCSF , collect approximately 25,000 screen woman age February 2008-present . The current protocol describes study propose capitalize infrastructure establish BREAST Stamp Project . We propose perform study two phase : Phase one feasibility study : specifically , propose demonstrate use mail collect Oragene tube format saliva collection kit source germline DNA short self-administered questionnaire . This collection specimens data use inform launch phase two , full-scale study identify determinant mammographic volumetric density among approximately 10,000 woman less 50 year age raw image density data already collect . During first phase hope demonstrate feasibility achieve least 60 % participation unbiased representation subject regard demographic volumetric density measurement . Once feasibility approach establish , propose launch full-scale study contact remain ( approximately 10,000 ) woman exist volumetric density data collect questionnaires DNA sample necessary delineate genetic determinant mammographic density , well investigate hypothesize risk factor mammographic density breast cancer risk , alcohol intake , cigarette smoking , breastfeed history .</brief_summary>

We complete phase one feasibility portion protocol , target 200 woman mail . As January 25 , 2011 , 200 mail invitation , 195 woman contact ( 5 subject form return bad address ) , 106 woman enrol . We currently analyze data feasibility study determine participation rate , quality complete questionnaire saliva sample , frequency distribution key risk factor demographics participant .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women undergo screen Vermont ask willingness participate research VBCSS . The phase one feasibility study enroll woman agree participate research age 50 year time screen mammogram two time period : February 1 , 2008 February 29 , 2008 February 1 , 2009 February 28 , 2009 . These period choose mammogram perform interval perform use Hologic machine equip density phantom require method time period represent first second year density data collection . If feasibility study prove successful , phase two study enroll woman agree participate research age 50 year time screen mammogram : February 1 , 2008present time . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We exclude woman time mammogram : prior history breast cancer , excisional breast biopsy within prior year , implant place , receive nonsurgical treatment ( i.e. , systemic therapy radiation ) cancer organ . We also exclude woman participant current BREAST Stamp Project .</criteria>
