	<brief_title>A Study Demonstrate Efficacy Tolerability Ferrous Bisglycinate Chelate Iron Deficiency Anaemia Compare These With Those Ferrous Ascorbate .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Iron deficiency common form malnutrition globally . In India , nearly 70 % woman estimate iron deficient . Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA , Hb &lt; 12gm/dl ) late manifestation iron deficiency . IDA consequence decrease iron intake , increase iron loss body increase iron requirement Blood loss menstruation predispose woman poor iron store presence excess menstrual bleed contribute development IDA woman . Patients IDA usually present fatigue , headache , bodyache , paraesthesia lack concentration . IDA cause menorrhagia , turn aggravate IDA . With severe anemia , may amenorrhoea well . Iron deficiency anaemia often treat iron tablet ferrous sulphate , ferrous fumarate ferrous gluconate . It usually take 6-10 week Hb return normal initiation oral iron therapy . Although efficacious haematological point view , therapy associate limit gastrointestinal side effect ( e.g . nausea , vomit , constipation , diarrhoea abdominal pain ) , eventually reduce patient compliance . Among recent alternative , iron bisglycine chelate use successfully treat iron deficiency anaemia also well tolerated therapy . Use ferrous bisglycinate chelate ( tablet contain 60mg elemental iron ferrous bisglycinate chelate , 1 mg folic acid , 5 mcg cyanocobalamin 15 mg zinc bis-glycinate ) , 1 tablet daily well establish nutritional supplement India . However , treatment iron deficiency anaemia , woman may need 1 tablet/day , may need 2 tablet /day . In India , ferrous ascorbate tablet ( tablet contain 100 mg elemental iron ferrous ascorbate , 1 mg folic acid ) recommend dose 1 tablet daily widely accepted form treatment iron deficiency anaemia . The primary purpose study demonstrate efficacy tolerability profile ferrous bisglycinate chelate support registration product 'drug ' India . Comparative data ferrous bisglycinate chelate ferrous ascorbate also augment exist knowledge , support use ferrous bisglycinate chelate treatment iron deficiency anaemia . Objective ( ) Primary : To estimate mean rise haemoglobin level patient iron deficiency anaemia 8 week treatment ( vs. baseline ) ferrous bisglycinate chelate ( 1 tablet 2 tablet daily ) . Secondary : 1 . To compare mean rise haemoglobin patient iron deficiency anaemia 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate , 1 tablet 2 tablet daily vs. ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . 2 . To compare average rate rise haemoglobin 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablet daily ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . 3 . To compare proportion patient achieve target Hb ≥ 12gm/dl 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablet daily ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . 4 . To compare % incidence gastrointestinal side effect 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablet daily ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . Study Design This multicentre , randomize , laboratory-blinded , parallel-group study . It project study randomize 270 woman ( 90 subject treatment arm ) iron deficiency anaemia ( Hb 6-9 gm/dl + serum Ferritin &lt; 15 μg/l ) either ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet/day , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablets/day ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet/day 8 week . At fortnightly visit , blood collect Hb ( evaluate efficacy ) , adverse event document ( evaluate tolerability ) , investigational drug dispense reason non compliance record . The total study duration consist 8-week treatment period involve 6 clinic visit . Study Endpoints/Assessments Primary Endpoint ( ) Rise haemoglobin baseline 8 week ferrous bisglycinate chelate group ( 1 tablet daily 2 tablet daily ) . Secondary Endpoint ( ) 1 . The difference average change Hb baseline 8 week ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 2 tablet daily , ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . 2 . The difference average rate rise Hb 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablet daily , ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . 3 . The difference proportion patient achieve target Hb ≥12gm/dl 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablet daily , ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily . 4 . The difference % incidence gastrointestinal side effect 8 week treatment ferrous bisglycinate chelate 1 tablet daily , ferrous bisglycinate chelate 2 tablet daily ferrous ascorbate 1 tablet daily .</detailed_description>
