	<brief_title>A Study Effectiveness Armodafinil Treat Cancer-Related Fatigue Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , multi-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover study evaluate efficacy armodafinil dosage 150 mg/day treatment cancer-related fatigue ( CRF ) adult patient multiple myeloma . The study consist screen period , follow 56 day treatment phase , final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment . The screening period occur within 14 day baseline , `` baseline '' refers day 1 assessment make drug administration . During period , medical history obtain along complete physical examination include vital sign measurement Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status . Clinical laboratory test include hematology , clinical chemistry ( blood urea nitrogen [ BUN ] , serum creatinine , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ) , electrolytes ( potassium , sodium , chloride calcium ) , random glucose , total protein , albumin , urinalysis also perform screening period well serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . During screen period , patient also assess presence cancer-related fatigue use International Classification Disease Tenth Edition ( ICD-10 ) diagnostic criterion Brief Fatigue Inventory ( BFI ) . Only patient show evidence cancer-related fatigue enrol study . The criteria inclusion give patient consist meeting International Classification Disease Tenth Edition ( ICD-10 ) criteria cancer-related fatigue score â‰¥ 4 BFI . ICD-10 CRF classification establish use standard interview guide . Patients eligible study randomize either receive armodafinil initial fix dosage 150 mg/day ( Group A ) placebo ( Group B ) first 28 day treatment phase . On day 29 , patient randomize receive placebo cross receive armodafinil dosage 150 mg/day day 56 . Group A patient randomized receive armodafinil continue current treatment drug day 56 . The duration treatment phase 56 day . Assessments CRF conduct day 1 ( baseline ) prior drug treatment , drug administration day 15 , 28 , 43 , 56 . These assessment conduct verbal interview , paper-and-pencil survey , paper-and-pencil test , electronic test appropriate per assessment . During treatment phase , patient also clinical laboratory test perform day 1 , 15 , 28 , 43 56 monitor potential toxicity . Additional procedure perform visit include monitoring adverse event , review concomitant medication support therapy ( e.g. , growth factor transfusion ) , ECOG performance status , vital sign measurement , physical examination . Twenty-eight day last dose study drug , patient complete final assessment ( herein refer end-of-treatment visit ) . Procedures conduct visit include measurement vital sign , complete physical examination , assessment adverse event , review concomitant medication , assessment ECOG performance status , hematology clinical chemistry laboratory test include electrolyte , total protein albumin . Patients withdraw study completion 56 day cycle still end-of-treatment assessment perform 28 day last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
