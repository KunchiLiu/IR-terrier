	<brief_summary>It conduct international multicenter prospective observational cohort study population ErbB2 positive metastatic breast cancer patient , whose disease progress trastuzumab-containing regimen , compare outcome two group : Group 1 : patient receive Lapatinib-capecitabine immediately 1st Trastuzumab progression ( second line treatment ) , Group 2 : patient receive Lapatinib-capecitabine 2 line treatment 1st trastuzumab progression ( third line great ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Early Versus Late Switch Lapatinib-Capecitabine ( TYCO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lapatinib combination capecitabine standard care treatment ErbB2+ metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) patient progress anthracyclines , taxanes trastuzumab treatment . Results lapatinib pivotal trial show addition lapatinib capecitabine increase median time progression ( TTP ) even among heavily pre-treated patient ( median 4 prior line therapy ) . A recent ad hoc subset analysis trial suggest early administration lapatinib-capecitabine MBC patient progress trastuzumab may produce good clinical outcome . The TYCO study design evaluate early switch lapatinib-capecitabine patient ErbB2+ MBC progress trastuzumab-containing regimen improve TTP comparison later start ( several line therapy ) . Secondary objective include Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) , 1 year Overall Survival ( OS ) , description report serious adverse event . This international , multicenter , prospective , observational ( non-interventional ) study 269 ErbB2+MBC patient whose disease progress treatment trastuzumab . Two cohort compare ; Group 1 : patient receive lapatinib-capecitabine immediately first trastuzumab progression , Group 2 : patient receive lapatinib-capecitabine two line treatment first trastuzumab progression . Eligibility criterion include female age 18 confirm ErbB2+ MBC progress previous trastuzumab-containing regimen , eligible start standard therapy lapatinib-capecitabine approve conventional dos , per local label approval . The study duration 12 month data collection baseline approximately every 3 month thereafter . Patient evaluation conduct per standard patient care center TTP determine treat physician ( clinically radiologically ) . Enrollment start February 2010 completion accrual estimate December 2011 .</detailed_description>
