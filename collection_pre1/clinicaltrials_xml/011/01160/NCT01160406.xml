	<brief_summary>The aim study assess incidence patient suffer ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack underlie asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation . Patients suffer ischemic stroke transient ischemic attack , without history atrial fibrillation , plan include . Starting within 14 day ischemic stroke , participate patient ask perform 10 second ECG recording use handheld ECG device twice daily ( morning evening ) 30 day . These recording transmit via telephone secure encrypt Internet site . Within 30 day participant also perform ambulatory 24 hour Holter recording . Handheld ECG recording evaluate continuously . In case atrial fibrillation patient inform offer treatment anti coagulant medication ( Warfarin ) . The investigation comparison 24 hour continuous ECG recording short intermittent ECG recording twice daily long time period determine method best detect atrial fibrillation patient group . Hypothesis : Short Intermittent ECG recording long time period efficient , compare continuous 24 hour ECG recording , detect silent paroxysmal AF patient ischemic stroke without history atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
