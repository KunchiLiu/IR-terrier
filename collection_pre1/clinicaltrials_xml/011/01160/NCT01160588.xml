	<brief_title>Brain Markers Anxiety Disorders SSRI/CBT Treatment Children Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anxiety disorder common highly disable condition child adolescence often remit , increase risk depression , anxiety , substance abuse , suicide adulthood . Available treatment modestly successful . When effective , however , early treatment anxiety disorder reduce subsequent morbidity . This study examine variation genetics brain reactivity among child adolescent respond SSRIs Cognitive Behavioral Therapy . Through , study identify neurological genetic biomarkers predict responsiveness SSRI/CBT treatment anxiety disorder . For SSRI/medication treatment arm : Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) medication widely prescribe child adolescent anxiety disorder , little known neurobiological factor predict patient respond treatment . Current theory suggest neurological function genetics may influence patient 's response treatment . Participation study last approximately 14 week . Both healthy participant participant anxiety disorder recruit participate . All participant complete similar study visit entry , within 2 week entry , 12 week . The first visit , occur study entry , include screen questionnaire , interview research staff , medical screening , collection saliva sample genotyping . The second visit last visit , separate 12 week , involve MRI scan behavioral task conduct inside outside MRI scanner . Over 12 week MRI scan session , participant anxiety disorder take sertraline , common SSRI , daily basis . They also attend nine additional visit time complete assessment symptom . These visit occur 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 week first scan . Participants anxiety disorder therefore complete symptom assessment , MRI scan , behavioral task final visit , 12 week second visit . In addition , participant complete task connect Electroencephalography ( EEG ) machine 12 week treatment , option additional EEG 's week 2 , 4 , 8 . For CBT arm : Participation study last 16 week . All participant complete similar study visit entry , within 2 week entry , approximately 16 week . The first visit , occur study entry , include screen questionnaire , interview research staff , medical screening , collection saliva sample genotyping . The second visit last visit , separate approximately 16 week , involve MRI scan behavioral task conduct inside outside MRI scanner . Over 16 week MRI scan session , participant anxiety disorder participate type talk therapy -- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy -- weekly basis . In addition , participant complete task connect Electroencephalography ( EEG ) machine 16 week treatment , option additional EEG 's week 2 , 4 , 8 .</detailed_description>
