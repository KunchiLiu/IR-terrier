	<detailed_description>This phase II study multicenter , open label trial design determine whether association Revlimid Prednisone ( RP ) induction treatment follow Revlimid , Melphalan Prednisone ( MPR ) consolidation treatment safe induce significant rate PR ( CR ) newly diagnose elderly MM patient . This study consist 3 phase study subject : Pre-treatment , Treatment , long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) . Pre-treatment period : providing write informed consent , patient undergo screen protocol eligibility outline Schedule Study Assessments . Treatment period : include induction , consolidation maintenance . Induction regimen : Patients start induction treatment association Lenalidomide Prednisone ( RP ) . Consolidation regimen After completion 4 RP cycle therapy continue MPR association : · According result first stage decision follow : 1 . The study may continue second stage , dose lenalidomide MPR cycle , grade 3-4 adverse event 25-50 % PR &gt; 50 % ; 2 . The study may stop ( PR &lt; 40 % grade 3-4 adverse event &gt; 25-30 % ) 3 . A new first stage may start : - At increase dose Lenalidomide administer advanced MPR cycle grade 3-4 adverse event &lt; 25-30 % , independently efficacy ; - At reduce dose Lenalidomide administer advanced MPR cycle grade 3-4 adverse event &gt; 50 % PR rate &gt; 50 % Maintenance : Within 3 month last MPR cycle , therapy continue RP maintenance .
