	<brief_summary>This phase II , multicenter , open label , nonrandomized study evaluate efficacy safety lenalidomide dose 10 mg/dose combination bortezomib 1.0 mg/m2/dose , pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ( PLD ) 4.0 mg/m2/dose , intravenous ( IV ) dexamethasone 40 mg/dose adult patient relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma ( MM ) . The study consist screen period , follow eight 28 day open label treatment cycle , final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment cycle , follow-up period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin , Bortezomib , Dexamethasone Lenalidomide Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show combination PLD bortezomib strike synergy preclinical study impressive response rate ( 73 &amp; 89 % ) early clinical trial MM patient relapsed/refractory disease well first-line therapy . In addition , efficacy PLD bortezomib anthracycline-insensitive patient great single-agent bortezomib compare across study . The immunomodulatory drug , thalidomide lenalidomide , target tumor cell microenvironment , antiangiogenic , immune activation effect also exert direct cytotoxic effect myeloma cell . A phase 1 clinical study group also demonstrate low dose PLD , administer frequent dosing schedule , combination bortezomib , dexamethasone ( DVD regimen ) well tolerate associate high response rate durable response . In phase II prospective trial , evaluate regimen show change enhances DVD-R regimen 's safety efficacy patient relapsed/refractory MM .</detailed_description>
