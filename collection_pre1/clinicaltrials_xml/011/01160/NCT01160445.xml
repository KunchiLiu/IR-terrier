	<brief_summary>Background : - Aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) drug help shrink tumor patient metastatic renal cancer metastatic melanoma . It possible remove certain white blood cell ( know CD4 cell ) IL-2 treatment may improve treatment effect . - Zanolimumab antibody work destroy CD4 cell blood . Researchers interested determine whether zanolimumab improve result IL-2 treatment give , , IL-2 treatment . In addition , research zanolimumab may provide information IL-2 treatment cause tumor stop grow shrink . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness IL-2 treatment conjunction zanolimumab individual metastatic cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose metastatic melanoma metastatic kidney cancer . Design : - Eligible participant screen full physical examination medical history , image study , blood sample , include leukapheresis , remove sample white blood cell test purpose . Participants may also colonoscopy biopsy receive previous treatment know cause colon damage . - Participants treat zanolimumab IL-2 treatment 9 week . - Zanolimumab give outpatient basis week 1 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 . In week 5 7 , participant receive zanolimumab inpatient addition IL-2 therapy . - Inpatient IL-2 treatment give week 5 7 . Up 15 dos IL-2 treatment give maximum 5 day , follow inpatient recovery time . - During week 5 , participant tumor image study prior receive zanolimumab IL-2 treatment . - About 2 week treatment period , participant return clinical center 2-day evaluation physical examination , image study , blood sample . - Participants whose tumor respond treatment offer two additional course treatment , start 6 8 week last IL-2 dose . Subsequent course give exactly describe initial course treatment . Participants whose tumor respond treatment follow-up evaluation require study researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) Following Administration Zanolimumab ( Anti-CD4mAb ) Metastatic Melanoma Metastatic Renal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Zanolimumab human monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) specifically recognize CD4 protein express subset T lymphocytes monocyte human , non-human primate . Ongoing clinical study identify 14 mg/kg dose zanolimumab weekly safe efficacious dose . Toxicities zanolimumab include headache , influenza-like illness , injection/infusion site reaction , nasopharyngitis , pyrexia , diarrhea , fatigue , cytokine release syndrome time infusion . The current protocol base hypothesis transient elimination CD4+ T-regulatory cell zanolimumab enhance clinical effectiveness aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) administration decrease T-regulatory cell generation . Objectives : Primary objective : Determine ability combination aldesleukin zanolimumab ( anti-CD4 mAb ) administration mediate tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma metastatic kidney cancer . Secondary objective : Determine rate depletion repopulation CD4+ cell . Determine toxicity treatment . Determine potential pharmacokinetic interaction zanolimumab aldesleukin . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must : measurable metastatic melanoma metastatic kidney cancer ; clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 . Patients may : previously receive high dose aldesleukin . Design : Patients receive zanolimumab dose 14 mg/kg intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion weekly 9 week . After fifth seventh dose zanolimumab , aldesleukin administer i.v . bolus dose 720,000 IU/kg every 8 hour maximum 15 dos . Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , compute tomography ( CT ) clinical laboratory evaluation 2 week zanolimumab administration . If patient stable disease ( SD ) tumor shrinkage , repeat complete evaluation perform every 1-3 month . After first year , patient continue respond follow evaluation every 3-4 month study criterion meet . If patient stable disease partial response treatment initial evaluation , patient recurs progress clinical response , may eligible re-treatment . Patients enter one two stratum : metastatic melanoma metastatic renal cancer . Each stratum conduct use optimal two-stage phase II design rule unacceptably low 15 % clinical response rate , favor modestly high response rate 35 % ( p1=0.35 ) .</detailed_description>
