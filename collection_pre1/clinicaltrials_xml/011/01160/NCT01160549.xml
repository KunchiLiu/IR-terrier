	<brief_summary>International variation breast cancer rate data migrant animal study support possibility exposure early development , include utero period , play role breast carcinogenesis . One strike prenatal influence breast cancer risk whether woman bear country low high breast cancer incidence . This observation lead interest degree utero exposure vary maternal environment , hypothesis alteration prenatal concentration steroid hormone , particularly estrogen , biologic parameter fetus expose mediate difference subsequent breast cancer risk . There strike difference breast cancer incidence rate Asian North American Western European population , variation within Asia also wide . Incidence Mongolia one low world ( 6.6/100,000 ) China , neighbor south , three time rate ( 18.7/100,000 ) . Furthermore , rate appear high urban rural area . Over last decade half Mongolia experience profound economic change result mass migration nomadic semi-nomadic existence western lifestyle capital city Ulaanbaatar . Together contrast exposure traditional urban setting , migration present opportunity study woman acculturate western lifestyle . We propose collect maternal cord blood sample pregnant Mongolian woman offspring live rural urban area describe concentration several steroid hormone growth factor . The purpose study ass whether utero environment differs woman live traditional lifestyle compare urban lifestyle , degree western acculturation among recently migrate capital . Maternal cord blood sample ongoing cohort study conduct University Pittsburgh provide comparison group US woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The National Cancer Institute conduct research country around world purpose document international difference hormone growth factor level intent try understand relate health . In particular , recent evidence suggest hormone growth factor early life may affect late disease risk . Dr. Ganmaa , native Mongolian physician Harvard-trained scientist suggest include Mongolia one research settings NCI multi-centered study since country offer distinct population unique lifestyle tradition . Over last decade half Mongolia experience profound economic change result mass migration nomadic semi-nomadic existence western lifestyle capital city Ulaanbaatar . Together contrast exposure traditional urban setting , migration present opportunity study woman acculturate western lifestyle . Mongolia provide unique opportunity ass whether difference urban rural lifestyle behavior influence health . The purpose study ass whether pregnancy environment differs woman live traditional lifestyle compare urban lifestyle , degree western acculturation among recently migrate capital . We plan compare steroid hormone growth factor maternal cord blood sample pregnant Mongolian woman live rural urban area pregnant woman US ( Brigham Women 's Hospital Boston ) , UK ( Avon Longitudinal Study Parents Children ) , Norway ( Norwegian Mother Child Cohort ) outside Beijing , China ( CDC 's randomized trial pregnancy supplement ) .</detailed_description>
