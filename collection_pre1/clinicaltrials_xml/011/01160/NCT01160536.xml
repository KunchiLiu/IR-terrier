	<brief_summary>This study propose describe child hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) risk status affect family functioning , behavior , relationship . HCM common inherit cardiovascular single-gene disorder . Individuals HCM may experience shortness breath , chest pain , palpitation , dizziness , syncope , heart failure , arrhythmias predispose sudden cardiac death age . Notably , HCM common cause sudden cardiac death people 30 year age . Genetic test identify at-risk individual ; however , impact potentially life-altering genetic information family remain largely unexplored . Increasingly , health care provider provide test child condition like HCM life-threatening medically manageable without benefit understanding psychological consequence . The study conduct suggest genetic test child may result change family relationship , parental emotional wellbeing , parent behavior , child function subset child . One synthesis study suggest child group show little evidence maladjustment risk information , parent affect carrier status child . The propose study intend body knowledge explore impact child risk status family HCM . Health care provider researcher inform work HCM family well understand potential impact genetic risk important component family adaptation life-threatening information child . The family target exploratory study purposively sample aware child risk status at-risk status HCM least 3 month . The cross-sectional design compose semi-structured interview parent , separately , his/her 13 23 year-old child either carrier HCM , non-carrier , 50 % risk carrier . The interview target issue relate perceived impact child risk status family functioning , parent behavior relationship . Data parent-child dyad analyze concordance/discordance along parallel theme . The result study may facilitate understand perceived impact learn child HCM risk status , inform clinical care future research .
