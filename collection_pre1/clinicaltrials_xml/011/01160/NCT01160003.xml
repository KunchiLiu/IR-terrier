	<detailed_description>GW870086X potent glucocorticoid agonist human vitro functional assay development inhale treatment asthma child . This study determine PK characteristic assess safety tolerability nebule formulation GW870086X healthy volunteer 14 day dose . This first clinical study assess nebule formulation . The purpose study ensure dos select good safety profile line find previous DPI formulation study , assess PK profile single ( Day 1 ) repeat dose ( Day 14 ) select appropriate dos future study nebule formulation . This study also provide additional safety cover nebules formulation give long duration study previously DPI formulation move paediatric programme . This study design give least 5-fold cover high dose studied future paediatric programme . During study cortisol production assess measure 24 hour cortisol profile serum urine well perform ACTH stimulation test . Two dos ( 5mg 8.75mg ) select . These dose 5 10 time higher anticipated maximum clinical dose . The dos select ensure sufficient safety cover future paediatric study well confirm absence significant adrenal inhibition dos would expect cause complete inhibition cortisol production traditional steroid .</detailed_description>
