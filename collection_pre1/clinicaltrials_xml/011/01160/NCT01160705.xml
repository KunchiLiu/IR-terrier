	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor learn change occur DNA identify biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study blood sample predict patient prostate cancer respond treatment docetaxel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarkers Response Taxotere HRPC . ICORG 08-08 , V2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine mRNA present circulate tumor cell help predict response patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer treat docetaxel . - In parallel , base discovery make since protocol initially submit ICORG , also propose analyse serum specimen consent patient presence EC miRNA , mRNA protein predictive response Taxotere . Secondary - To develop predictive model base accurate sensitive combination biomarkers . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Treatment Plan : All patient treat Docetaxel weekly , biweekly three weekly schedule , dose schedule discretion treat physician . Blood sample collect biomarker laboratory study baseline , every 3-4 week study , disease progression every 12 week completion study . Samples analyze mRNA via RT-PCR .</detailed_description>
