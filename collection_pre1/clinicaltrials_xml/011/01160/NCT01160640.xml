	<detailed_description>This study randomize placebo-controlled trial compare two antibiotic treatment regimen acute PID . Women acute PID randomize one two treatment regimen . One group woman receive single intramuscular dose ceftriaxone 250 mg , doxycycline 100 mg orally twice day 14 day , along placebo tablet orally twice day 14 day . The second group woman receive dos ceftriaxone doxycycline , metronidazole 500 mg orally twice day 14 day . The primary objective compare eradication anaerobic organism upper genital tract woman acute PID receive standard outpatient antibiotic treatment eradication organism upper genital tract woman receive standard outpatient treatment along two-week course metronidazole . Women follow one month clinical outcome , undergo assessment clearance microorganism upper genital tract . Our hypothesis antibiotic treatment regimen include anaerobic coverage effectively clear anaerobic organism endometrium woman acute PID compare standard antibiotic treatment regimen lack effective antibiotic coverage anaerobe .</detailed_description>
