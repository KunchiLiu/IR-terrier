	<brief_summary>Background : Podoconiosis debilitate condition affect one million people Ethiopia . Podoconiosis preventable genetically high risk consistently protect foot exposure silica nanoparticles present clay soil . Despite effort local Non-Government Organization ( NGO ) Mossy Foot Prevention &amp; Treatment Association ( MFTPA ) distribute shoe podoconiosis patient child , use footwear intermittent . This protocol propose collaboration among faculty NHGRI , Addis Ababa University , MFTPA develop test intervention approach potential sustain community , motivate child family affect podoconiosis consistently wear shoe . Objective : The three primary aim : ( 1 ) use qualitative assessment strategy explore factor influence shoe use among high-risk child ; ( 2 ) use finding develop culturally-tailored intervention module ; ( 3 ) evaluate randomize trial individual joint effect intervention module encourage high-risk child consistently wear shoe . Population : Children ( age 9 -15 ) family affect podoconiosis participate shoe distribution one 13 community Wolaita zone Ethiopia serve MFTPA . Methods : Guided PRECEDE-PROCEED approach planning , implement evaluate public health program , two-phase study propose . Phase 1 employ qualitative method include participant observation , extend case study , key-informant interview focus group discussion sample 4 community gain understanding factor influence shoe wear among high-risk child . Informed result , content two module ( enhanced education module role model support module ) develop aim motivate consistent use footwear . Phase 2 evaluate individual joint effectiveness two intervention module randomize 2 x 2 factorial design community assign randomly one 4 intervention condition : ( GP1 ) enhance health education role model support ( usual care ) , ( GP2 ) enhance health education without role model support , ( GP3 ) enhance health education role model support , ( GP4 ) enhance health education role model support . All child receive shoe . Children survey baseline , 3-5 day shoe distribution , , 3- 6- month post baseline . Outcomes : The primary outcome composite direct observation shoe use , self-reported shoe use , baseline-to-follow-up change child foot appearance base visual foot exam .</brief_summary>
