	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . AZD6244 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether fulvestrant effective without AZD6244 treat patient advance breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well fulvestrant work without AZD6244 treat patient advance breast cancer progress aromatase inhibitor therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant With Without AZD6244 Treating Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer That Progressed After Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess efficacy fulvestrant versus without MEK inhibitor AZD6244 patient advanced stage , endocrine-sensitive breast cancer progress aromatase inhibitor therapy . Secondary - To assess safety tolerability regimen patient . - To examine outcome parameter . - To develop virtual tissue bank future translational research . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center , prior treatment tamoxifen citrate ( yes v ) , set prior aromatase inhibitor give ( adjuvant treatment v advance stage treatment ) , HER-2 disease ( positive v negative ) , visceral metastasis ( present v absent ) , performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) , disease ( measurable disease vs bone-only disease small unequivocal liver lung metastasis ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( experimental ) : Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 15 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Patients also receive oral AZD6244 twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( control ) : Patients receive fulvestrant arm I . Patients also receive oral placebo twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
