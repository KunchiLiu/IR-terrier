	<detailed_description>Design population The design pair-matched community intervention trial . Village cluster high level malnutrition select rural area ten sub-Saharan African country reflect diverse range agro-ecological zone , farm system , disease profile , infrastructure challenge . MVP sit represent 80 village 14 cluster across 10 country , cover nearly 500,000 people . For intervention cluster , match comparison cluster select random participate evaluation . Outcomes The primary outcome under-5 mortality rate . Secondary outcome level coverage essential maternal-child health intervention related MDG indicator poverty , nutrition , education , environmental health . Sample size calculation The assessment follow 6000 household across intervention match comparison village baseline , 3 5 year intervention exposure . With 10 paired cluster , study power detect 40 % difference U5MR two group . Analysis plan The analysis use two-staged pair-matched cluster level analysis , complement multilevel modeling . Reporting adhere Transparent Reporting Evaluations Non-randomized Designs ( TREND ) guideline . Implementation science A portfolio qualitative implementation science ( process evaluation ) complement quantitative assessment , involve interview implementers , partner , project beneficiary . This analysis address question : feasibility intervention ; time sequence introduction ; key contextual barrier facilitator implementation ; potential synergy achieve integrated multisector approach . Economic costing study One project hypothesis annual per capita investment $ 110 require achieve MDGs . The aim economic costing study document absolute relative contribution project partner ( MVP , government , donor , community ) price non-priced cluster-level activity , well sector-specific breakdown input .</detailed_description>
