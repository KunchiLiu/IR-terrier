	<brief_title>Posterior Capsule Opacification ( PCO ) With Single Piece Hydrophobic Versus Hydrophillic Intraocular Lens ( IOL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amongst several surgical technique IOL technology influence opacification posterior capsule , role IOL material optic design remain crucial determining development . The single-piece Acrylic IOLs hydrophobic surface widely use practice . The single-piece Acrylic IOLs hydrophilic surface become commercially available recently . Although study compare single piece hydrophobic single piece hydrophilic IOL , conduct old generation hydrophilic IOL . Moreover , experimental clinical study perform evaluate posterior capsule opacification Hydrophilic acrylic IOL sharp optic edge design exclude optic-haptic junction , versus new generation hydrophilic IOL design improve 360-degree sharp edge , result favour latter design . There little data compare single-piece Acrylic IOLs hydrophobic surface new generation single-piece Acrylic IOLs hydrophilic surface . Because IOL characteristic play crucial role prevent posterior capsule opacification ( PCO ) , clinical importance , well investigational interest ass PCO follow implantation IOLs . We conduct prospective , randomised , intra-individual study compare 3 year postoperative PCO result single-piece hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs versus new generation single-piece hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs patient undergo bilateral cataract surgery .</detailed_description>
