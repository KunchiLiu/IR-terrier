	<brief_summary>In recent year , social network garner attention academic journal lay press strong association demonstrate retrospective study social network incidence major health problem obesity smoke . Financial incentives also demonstrate improve health behavior obesity , smoking , medication adherence . We propose conduct randomize controlled trial among predominantly African American population persistently poor diabetes mellitus ( DM ) control examine whether two novel intervention , lottery base financial incentive telephone base one-on-one peer mentoring ( 'buddy system ' ) , significantly ameliorate disparity poor DM control . The intervention base epidemiologic evidence , randomize controlled trial , pilot study demonstrate : 1 ) Lottery base financial incentive powerful motivator behavior change ; 2 ) One-on-one peer mentor flexible , cost-efficient mean increase DM specific social support may particularly salient minority community ; 3 ) Matching patient poorly control DM similar individual community gain control DM draw exist community asset create inherently culturally competent intervention . DM patient poor DM control randomize 1 4 arm : usual care ; telephone base one-on-one peer mentoring ; lottery base financial incentive ; peer mentor plus financial incentive . The Specific Aims test : 1 ) The effectiveness telephone base one-on-one peer mentor improve glycemic control relative usual care ; 2 ) The effectiveness lottery base financial incentive improve glycemic control relative usual care ; 3 ) The effectiveness combine peer mentor financial incentive relative control ; 4 ) The relative cost effectiveness four approach . In exploratory analysis , examine whether African American patient enrol intervention arm great improvement glycemic control white patient , whether intervention group patient experience great improvement blood pressure ( BP ) lipid control , whether peer mentor experience improvement health . We pair mentor mentees base race , gender , age , disease severity . The active intervention run 6-month time period , participant follow additional 6 month determine effect persist post intervention . The proposed intervention address multiple barrier effective disease management common among patient DM . If effective , intervention could provide important model improve glycemic control general , particular , address racial disparity DM outcome .</brief_summary>
