	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness MIST Therapy combination standard care ( SOC ) compare SOC alone reduce bacteria wound prepare wound bed surgical closure patient chronic , non-healing wound . The MIST Therapy System deliver therapeutic ultrasound wound bed without direct contact . Saline solution convert fine particle release towards wound sound pressure wave remove dead damage tissue . The MIST Therapy System currently FDA clear non-contact ultrasound device promote wound heal . Standard care procedure include surgical debridement wound operating room remove infect , dead tissue bone . This research do investigator know commonly-used treatment well , investigator would like evaluate bacteria present wound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MIST Therapy 's Effectiveness Wound Bed Preparation Role Bacterial Biofilm Chronic , Non-healing Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial design investigator-initiated prospective , randomize , control single blind study , single study center , person present chronic , non-healing wound knee potential rapid deterioration , lead limb loss . Chronic wound define , present longer 30 day fail demonstrate great 50 % reduction surface area previous 30 day despite administration appropriate standard wound care well case present acute gangrene massive tissue loss meet 30 day criterion include . All wound must least 5 cm2 . A SOC Doppler assessment perform ensure wound adequately vascularize . For subject present multiple chronic , non-healing wound , large wound meeting entrance criterion enrol study . This refer patient 's `` index wound . '' Once wind designate `` index wound , '' wind remain index wound duration patient 's study participation . Adult patient ESRD chronic , non-healing wound consent study screen eligibility subject meet inclusion none exclusion criterion , enrol study participation . Enrolled patient randomize receive one two treatment course : ) MIST Therapy conjunction Standard Care ( SOC ) ( treatment group ) , b ) SOC use Sham device ( control group ) . The Sham device nebulizer compressor design deliver continuous saline mist MIST Therapy System , without ultrasound wave . Both group primary closure ( ie . split thickness skin graft delay primary closure ) part eventual treatment plan . Both group undergo 5 SOC surgical debridement OR setting , debridement immediately follow subject 's assign study treatment . Prior initiate assign study treatment , randomize patient require undergo Baseline Evaluation . The Baseline Evaluation include : wound area measurement , wound bed evaluation , digital photograph . Following Baseline Evaluation , study patient undergo surgical debridement index wind operating room set . During time , tissue sample obtain prior debridement study group . A second tissue sample obtain study group immediately follow debridement ( either SOC debridement MIST therapy , depend group patient randomize ) . These tissue sample utilized assess presence biofilm wound prior follow assigned study treatment . A tissue sample take form 2mm punch biopsy obtain center wound well wound margin study group prior debridement immediately follow debridement ( either SOC debridement MIST therapy , depend group patient randomize ) . Along SOC wound culture , swab wound take treatment first OR visit send Georgetown University lab quantitative analysis bacteria present . Following Baseline evaluation surgical debridement , study subject undergo 4 subsequent Interim Study Evaluations . The Interim Study Evaluations include wound assessment , wound measurement , digital photograph , adverse event assessment , conduct frequency determine appropriate Principal Investigator wind bed appear appropriate primary closure . As part Interim Study Evaluation , study subject undergo subsequent surgical debridement OR setting , immediately follow assigned study treatment , ( i.e. , sham device saline rinse MIST therapy ) . Prior subsequent surgical debridement , SOC wound culture quantitative wound culture obtain analysis . Final tissue biopsy , wound center wound margin , obtain prior primary closure procedure . Following definitive wound closure procedure , split thickness skin graft delay primary wound closure , subject undergo Bi-Monthly Wound Assessment , follow maximum 20 week date his/her first surgical debridement . A Bi-Monthly Wound Assessment include assessment maintain wound closure adverse event assessment . SOC post-operative dressing may include Moist Wound Therapy use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy . NOTE : No impregnated dressing allow study period . No topical antibiotic antibiotic dressing , topical antiseptic ( silver , iodine , etc . ) , antimicrobial allow . The use EMLA Cream allow .</detailed_description>
