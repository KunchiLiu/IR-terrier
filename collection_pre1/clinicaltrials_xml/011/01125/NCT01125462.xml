	<brief_summary>The development recombinant DNA technology , culminate introduction first recombinant human follicle stimulate hormone ( r hFSH ) , Gonal-f , develop become Gonal-f Filled-by-Mass ( FbM ) pen use fertility treatment since many year . It find subject use pen find less stressful , easy use convenient conventional syringe would recommend prefilled pen another woman consider gonadotropin treatment . However , use Gonal-f ( FbM ) pen Serbian subject low level though Gonal f vial 75 IU follitropin alfa present Serbian market since 2003 . On contrary clinical practice European country , Serbian subject usually receive daily dose injectable gonadotropin IVF clinic partner/family member . This open-label , multicentric , observational non-interventional study design aim know reason Serbian subject inject Gonal f quality life ( QoL ) Serbian women/couples infertility problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fertility ability conceive induce conception . A normal fertile couple 20 % chance achieve pregnancy one month unprotected intercourse . Infertility define failure conceive 12 month unprotected intercourse . It generally estimate 10 % 15 % couple classify conception difficulty . About 30 % result female factor , 30 % result male factor 30 % due combination male female factor . In 10 % case , underlie cause find ( unexplained fertility ) . Follicle-stimulating hormone one key hormone regulate reproductive function female male . In female , stimulates development ovarian follicle carry oocyte , male promote spermatogenesis . Follicle-stimulating hormone bind receptor trigger intracellular mechanism regulate steroidogenesis , cell replication expression specific proteins growth modulate gametogenesis . Complete partial deficiency FSH secretion common cause infertility woman men . Administration FSH , either alone combination luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , use successfully treat infertility problem . Nearly 40 % woman infertile ovulatory problem . These disorder may originate pituitary , hypothalamus , ovary , anatomy reproductive system . Over last 50 year quality FSH use fertility treatment induce follicular development improve via several distinguishable step . For many year human menopausal gonadotropin ( hMG ) , mixture human LH FSH extract urine post-menopausal woman , available treatment infertility . However , Merck Serono develop recombinant human FSH ( r-hFSH ) clinical use , market several year . This development guide quest control variability urinary derive drug . The recombinant system well-defined control manufacturing process , mean content recombinant gonadotropin consistent batch-to-batch , accurately measure filled-by-mass ( i.e . term weight microgram ) . This allow precise dose control ovulation induction ( OI ) assist reproduction technique ( ART ) . Recombinant human fertility hormone consider consistency source material active product , purity specific activity protein , good efficacy , safety tolerability . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To evaluate ease-of-use Gonal-f ( FbM ) prefilled pen normal clinical practice condition different protocol follicular stimulation Secondary objective : - To evaluate local tolerability ( incidence local reaction injection site ) drug administration . This study plan conduct 3 IVF/ART clinic Serbia recruit approximately 20 subject per centre ( 10 group ) give total 60 subject . Subjects previous stimulation treatment use injectable gonadotropin stimulation clomiphene citrate enrol study . Depending kind gonadotropin use previous stimulation treatment subject treat ( mean either Gonal-f ampule urinary derive drug ) , subject stratify two group . The first group include subject undergone least one treatment cycle Gonal f powder solvent solution injection within past 12 month ( equivalent 75 IU/ml , 450 IU/0.75ml 1050 IU/1.75 ml ) . The second group include subject undergone least one treatment cycle urine-derived FSH therapy vial within past 12 month . Subjects group include study treat accord Summary Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) accord clinical practice site . These subject also answer question first internationally validate QoL questionnaire call FertiQoL . The FertiQoL instrument survey infertile subject assess QoL . Each every subject undergo one stimulation treatment cycle subject follow approximately 2 week chemically proven pregnancy . After treatment , subject satisfaction Gonal f ( FbM ) prefilled pen measure use post-treatment questionnaire participant ask compare treatment experience choose preferred injection method .</detailed_description>
