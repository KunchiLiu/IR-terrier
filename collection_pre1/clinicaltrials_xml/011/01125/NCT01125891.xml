	<brief_summary>Treatment cancer often effective two drug use together . For example , gemcitabine , approve drug , ON 01910.Na , new investigational anti-cancer drug , use together treat cancer cell laboratory animal , inhibition growth cancer cell compare either drug use . These result offer promise gemcitabine ON 01910.Na could use treat cancer patient . However , study seek find gemcitabine ON 01910.Na effective combination patient do , doctor must first know large , safe dose ON 01910.Na use combination gemcitabine . This study design answer question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Study Gemcitabine ON 01910.Na Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The order infusion Days 1 , 8 , 15 gemcitabine first , immediately follow ON 01910.Na . The dose gemcitabine fix 1000 mg/m2 i.v . 30 minute infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day . The start dose ON 01910.Na 600 mg/m2 2 hour intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 18 28-day course . The dose ON 01910.Na escalate increment successive cohort ( dose level ( DL ) 1 = 600 mg/m2 , DL 2 = 1200 mg/m2 , DL 3 = 1800 mg/m2 ) new patient . A course define 4 week length . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE v3.0 ) . A minimum three new patient treat dose level minimum 1 week stagger dose first remain patient new dose cohort . In exceptional circumstance ( e.g . one slot available cohort two eligible patient screen ) , Sponsor may allow four patient enter cohort ( seven patient enter expanded cohort ) . A DL -1A ( ON 01910.Na = 400 mg/m2 ) set case dose de-escalation require start dose due ON 01910.Na-related toxicity . A DL -1A gemcitabine = 750 mg/m2 DL - 1B 500 mg/m2 set case dose de-escalation require starting subsequent dos due gemcitabine-related toxicity . If DLT observe first three patient , dose ON 01910.Na increase next level ( see Section 4.2 definition DLT ) . If DLT occur first three new patient first course , least three additional new patient treat . If DLT encounter , dose escalation proceed . Alternately , DLT note one three additional patient , dose escalation terminate MTD define high dose level none first three patient one six patient experienced DLT course 1 . All patient receive dos exceed confirm MTD dose reduce MTD ; even apparently tolerate current dose . Intra-patient dose escalation ON 01910.Na permit . There limit number course could administer patient tolerate benefit therapy . A patient consider evaluable purpose dose escalation decision patient complete first course therapy without miss 1 dose ON 01910.Na reason unrelated toxicity , patient withdrawn due DLT . Non-evaluable patient replace . Escalation next dose level occur third evaluable patient ( sixth , expand cohort ) , previous dose level observe 4 week . Dose escalation decision make Cohort Review Committee ( CRC ) . Intra-patient dose escalation ON 01910.Na allow third evaluable patient next dose level observe 4 week acceptable tolerability ( ie , MTD exceed per criterion ) . Once MTD define , expand cohort 20 23 additional patient ( depend 3 6 patient enrol previous cohort ) enrol MTD dose level order define safety tolerability regimen , characterize pharmacokinetics ON 01910.Na alone gemcitabine , perform tumor biomarker study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically confirm solid malignancy standard curative palliative measure exist longer effective ; patient clinical rationale gemcitabinebased therapy . The last radiotherapy/chemotherapy dose must give â‰¥4 week prior study drug initiation ; acute chronic adverse event prior radiotherapy chemotherapy resolve &lt; Grade 2 determine CTCAE v3.0 . Patients must life expectancy least 12 week ECOG performance status &lt; 1 . Patients must &gt; 18 year age . Patients must evaluable disease , either informative tumor marker , measurable disease imaging , RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) criterion ( Appendix II ) . Patients must adequate liver renal function define serum creatinine great 2.0 time institution 's upper normal limit ( 24 hour creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ) total bilirubin level great 2.0 time institution 's upper normal limit transaminase level higher 3.0 time institution 's upper normal limit . ( Note patient primary liver cancer hepatic metastasis may total bilirubin value 1.5 mg/dl transaminase level 5.0 time limit normal ) . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define granulocyte count &gt; 1,500/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl .

For patient expanded phase MTD , tumor amenable single tumor biopsy , willingness undergo baseline tumor biopsy . Patients must sign informed consent form indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy institution . Patients exclude : They evidence active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month ; symptomatic coronary insufficiency heart block ; uncontrolled congestive heart failure ; moderate severe pulmonary dysfunction . They active infectious process . They active central nervous system metastasis . They receive prior radiotherapy administer 30 % marrowbearing bone mass . They ascites require active medical management include paracentesis twice month hyponatremia ( define serum sodium value &lt; 134 Meq/L ) . Women pregnant lactating . Male patient female sexual partner unwilling follow strict contraception requirement describe protocol ( see Section 5.4 ) . Patients major surgery without full recovery major surgery within 3 week ON 01910.Na treatment start .</criteria>
