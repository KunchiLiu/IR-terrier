	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient recurrent progression meningioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Meningiomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy bevacizumab patient recurrent progressive benign atypical/malignant meningioma , despite prior therapy , measure six-month progression-free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe response rate overall-survival patient population . II . To evaluate safety profile bevacizumab patient recurrent meningioma . III . To perform exploratory study patient hemangioblastoma hemangiopericytoma . IV . To assess tissue VEGF VEGFR correlate response . An exploratory analysis HER-2 perform . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week 6 month . Patients may receive bevacizumab IV every 3 week 12 month . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
