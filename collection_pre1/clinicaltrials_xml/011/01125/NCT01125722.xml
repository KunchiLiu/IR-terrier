	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether non-invasive neurostimulation patch effective treatment urgency , frequency urge ( urinary ) incontinence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Study Non-invasive Neurostimulation Device Urgency ( Urinary ) Incontinence Overactive Bladder ( OAB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While precise cause OAB symptom ( urge , frequency , incontinence ) clear , physicians researcher accept theory problem communication central nervous system bladder factor . Research show process call neuromodulation nerve control bladder overcome communication problem . In patient symptom cause communication problem , neuromodulation clinically proven eliminate significantly reduce symptom . While neuromodulation previously achieve implant electrode near sacral nerve spine , new concept investigation within protocol believe achieve similar effect adhesive electrode place skin spinal nerve low back .</detailed_description>
