	<brief_summary>The aim propose research compare two commonly use pediatric strength test measure : handheld myometry ( HHM ) CINRG Quantitative Measurement System ( CQMS ) , goal identify sensitive valid tool measure muscle strength child DMD . The data obtain study use make recommendation strength measurement endpoint prospective muscular dystrophy trial provide reliable accurate recommendation clinic strength assessment . This study perform six participate site Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group ( CINRG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Clinical Endpoint DMD : Handheld Myometry ( HHM ) Versus CINRG Quantitative Measurement System ( CQMS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose compare reliability CQMS vs. HHM DMD population . The importance study able compare result clinical trial do different network use distinct strength endpoint . If result indicate distinct difference reliability one tool , standardized tool could establish research group throughout world interpret strength context clinical trial . If result indicate minor difference would possible interpret compare/contrast strength measurement use different study . Understanding relationship HHM v CQMS help u examine surrogate measure capable predict functionality base strength measurement .</detailed_description>
