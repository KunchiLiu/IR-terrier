	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare level matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) , MMP-8 , MMP-13 tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) keloid skin tissue normal skin patient normal discard skin tissue ( control ) . The investigator aim correlate level MMPs patient keloid scar comparison normal discard tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Case-control Study Matrix Metalloproteinase Levels Tissue Patients With Keloid Scar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator anticipate enrol 20 patient study . The COST excision relate procedure WILL NOT cover research study . Patient patient 's health insurance provider responsible cost treatment related procedure . 1 . Patients must least 18 year old keloid agree biopsied . 2 . During screen visit obtain determine patient fulfills inclusion/exclusion criterion , obtain informed visit HIPAA authorization . Demographic information pertinent medical history obtain risk factor explain patient . 3 . A focused dermatological exam perform assess severity location keloid well skin phototype patient . 4 . A Henry Ford Hospital Dermatosurgeon excise biopsy keloid tissue normal tissue enrol patient specimens send lab workup . Discarded skin sample also collect Henry Ford Plastic Surgery Dermatology department analyze additional control normal skin . The discarded skin sample ( control ) region specific match keloid sample area body biopsy sample . 5 . Levels MMP 's measure keloid , normal tissue sample discard skin sample . 6 . Levels TIMPs measure keloid , normal tissue discard tissue sample</detailed_description>
