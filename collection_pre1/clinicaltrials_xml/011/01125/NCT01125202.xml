	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease single common cause death hemodialysis ( HD ) patient . Most HD patient leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , significant predictor death population . LVH related extracellular volume expansion hypertension , amenable dietary sodium restriction . However , dietary change widely know difficult achieve sustain . Controlling dietary sodium particularly difficult HD many food naturally high sodium , prepared/prepackaged food significant amount sodium add enhance taste shelf-life . Research behavioral method effective reduce dietary sodium intake HD limit . The purpose study test , randomize clinical trial 200 HD patient , behavioral intervention , pair PDA-based dietary self-monitoring , enhance adherence dietary sodium restriction . Specifically investigator : ( ) Assess impact intervention average daily interdialytic weight gain ( IDWG-A ) . ( b ) Examine impact intervention self-reported dietary sodium intake . The study hypotheses compare control group , intervention group : ( 1 ) demonstrate statistically significant decline IDWGA 4-month intervention period , ( 2 ) experience great decline dietary sodium intake . Secondarily , investigator explore impact intervention : ( ) pre-dialysis pulse pressure mean arterial blood pressure , ( b ) hemodialysis dietary self-efficacy , ( c ) intradialytic postdialytic symptom general health-related quality life . In addition , investigator characterize barriers/facilitators adherence HD dietary regimen patient experience intervention use qualitative method . The intervention base Social Cognitive Theory . Self-monitoring within context intervention operationalized PDA-based dietary record use BalanceLog software . Participants randomized attention control receive computerize dietary education . Attention control participant offer abbreviated version intervention 4-month study period concludes . Differences IDWG-A , pulse pressure , mean arterial pressure examine use random intercept linear regression model . Self-reported dietary sodium , self-efficacy , symptom , quality life assess baseline , 6 week , 4 month difference examine use repeat measure model use GEE . Qualitative analysis narrative data perform .</detailed_description>
