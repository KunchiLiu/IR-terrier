	<brief_title>Safety Study Tenofovir-containing Drug Regimen Prevention Mother-to-child Transmission HIV HBV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Great progress make prevent mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV resource-rich setting use combination antiretroviral regimen pregnancy peripartum . In resource-limited world simple inexpensive regimen administer peripartum , single dose nevirapine mother infant , effective reduce transmission cost development resistance . Strategies allow woman preserve antiretroviral option need therapy HIV disease improve efficacy urgently need . Moreover , co-infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) problem substantial proportion HIV-infected pregnant woman . HIV alters course HBV disease increase level HBV DNA replication thus risk transmission newborn . HBV immunization infant first dose start soon birth decrease bulk transmission , risk remains , particularly mother HBe antigen positivity . Ideally antiviral regimen administer pregnancy activity virus would minimize transmission HIV HBV infant . The investigator propose study combination tenofovir/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir start 14 28 week pregnancy HIV HBV co-infected woman . This regimen provide potent antiviral activity prevention MTCT . In addition , tenofovir lamivudine activity HBV , could play role decrease transmission HBV infant . This regimen compare WHO-recommended locally practice standard care , consist zidovudine/lamivudine/lopinavir-ritonavir , also start 14-28 week pregnancy . This phase II study evaluate safety test regimen pregnant woman newborn , particular renal , bone mineral density hepatic toxicity ( include hepatic flare post discontinuation therapy ) . The study recruit 80 pregnant woman least 20 year age China follow infant 12 month post-delivery . The investigator recruit prenatal clinic district heavily affect HIV Guangxi province China . China select study hyperendemic hepatitis B rise HIV epidemic . Although powered examine efficacy , preliminary estimate transmission HIV HBV infant rate resistance development obtain . The study do collaboration CDC-GAP China Chinese Ministry Health-National Center AIDS , coordinate recruitment , study visit data collection local HIV/AIDS coordinator .</detailed_description>
