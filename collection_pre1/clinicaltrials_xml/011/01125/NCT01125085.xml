	<brief_summary>The aim Proof Concept study determine therapeutic potential L19SIP antibody , label radionuclide 131I combination external beam radiation , treatment patient multiple brain metastasis follow promising result agent previous clinical study . The L19SIP antibody fully human antibody , capable preferential localization around tumor blood vessel spar normal tissue . The formation new blood vessel rare event adult ( exception make female reproductive cycle ) , pathological feature aggressive type cancer . The presented study follow Phase I subsequent Phase I/II dose find efficacy study agent patient variety cancer 131I-L19SIP show excellent tolerability therapeutic benefit patient enrol study .</brief_summary>
