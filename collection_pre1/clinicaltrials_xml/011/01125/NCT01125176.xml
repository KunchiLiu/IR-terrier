	<brief_summary>Our hypothesis treatment CLL alternate daily dose schedule thalidomide lenalidomide may result good tolerability decrease agent 's individual toxicity , preserve efficacy , therefore lead long duration therapy improved response . Additionally , combination 2 agent may additive synergistic effect therapeutically . In Cycle -1 , odd numbered patient receive oral thalidomide daily day 1-14 followed treatment day 15-28 . Even numbered patient receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-14 treatment day 15-28 . Starting cycle 1 , patient alternate daily thalidomide ( every odd day ) daily lenalidomide ( every even day ) day 1-28 . Rituximab give day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 start Cycle 1 , every 6th cycle thereafter ( cycle 7 , 13 , 19 , etc . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternating Thalidomide Lenalidomide Therapy Plus Rituximab ( THRiL ) Initial Treatment Patients With CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , phase II , single arm , single institution study investigate daily alternate therapy IMiD™ compound , thalidomide lenalidomide , plus rituximab untreated CLL patient require treatment . In order obtain correlative sample , patient receive two week course single agent thalidomide lenalidomide begin treatment combination regimen . Half patient ( odd number subject ) start two week course single agent thalidomide half patient ( even number subject ) start two week course single agent lenalidomide . This allow study correlative sample monotherapy either IMiD™ agent . In Cycle -1 half patient ( odd number subject ) receive thalidomide 50mg PO daily day 1-14 , follow treatment day 15-28 half patient ( even number subject ) receive lenalidomide PO daily day 1-14 , follow treatment day 15-28 . Starting cycle 1 : Patients receive thalidomide 50 mg every day ( every odd day day 1-28 : Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 &amp; 27 28 day cycle ) alternate lenalidomide alternate every day , dose base upon current level stepwise incremental dosing ( every even day day 1-28 : Days 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 22 , 24 , 26 &amp; 28 28 day cycle ) . The start dose lenalidomide base calculated creatinine clearance dose lenalidomide may escalate tolerate maximal dose 25 mg ( see Section 5 detail ) . Rituximab 375 mg/m2 administer day 1 , 8 , 15 22 start Cycle 1 weekly x 4 schedule every 6th cycle thereafter ( Cycles 7 , 13 , 19 , etc ) .</detailed_description>
