	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test safety combination everolimus , rituximab bortezomib . Everolimus drug work prevent cell body grow divide . Information basic clinical research suggest everolimus may also inhibit tumor growth people relapse refractory lymphoma . The FDA approve everolimus treatment multiple myeloma , cancer closely relate Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia . Rituximab approve FDA treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , include Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia . Funding Source - FDA OOPD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus , Bortezomib and/or Rituximab Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose combination study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participants Waldenstrom 's Macroglobulinemia , everyone participates research study receive combination study drug dose study drug . - In research study every 4 week ( 28 day ) period call cycle . While study , participant receive 6 cycle combination treatment follow everolimus alone 2 year . - Participants take everolimus mouth everyday , receive rituximab intravenously day 1 , 8 , 15 22 Cycle 1 Cycle 4 . If participant receives bortezomib , give intravenously day 1 , 8 15 every cycle . - After third cycle , test do see disease respond study treatment . If disease stay , help , participant continue get combination study treatment another 3 cycle .</detailed_description>
