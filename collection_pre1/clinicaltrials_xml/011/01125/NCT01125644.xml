	<criteria>The follow include study : Patients prove fungal etiology confirm mycological culture test hystopathological exam ( `` patient definite diagnosis '' ) , patient fungal infection difficult determine etiological agent diagnosis deep mycosis base blood test fungal infection and/or clinical radiological examination , and/or endoscopic clinical examination , clinical symptomatology ( `` patient clinical diagnosis '' ) . Patients treat antifungal drug ( ) show poor response treatment least 5 day administration antifungal drug , ( ii ) adverse reaction drug prejudicing use , determine risk/benefit ratio unfavorable patient . Patients 18 75 year age . Patients able understand content Informed Consent willing participate study . Male female patient . Patients initially admit hospital identify clinical study . Informed Consent . Patients treat antifungal drug improve clinical symptom unclear clinical course . Patients intravenous catheter hospitalize diagnosis fungemia without clinical symptomatology twelve hour removal catheter . Patients serious deep mycosis low change clinical efficacy ( high probability death event ) , serious concomitant illness complication , may make difficult safety evaluation treatment object study . Patients history allergy drug like AMPHB serious allergic reaction drug ( shock administration drug different antifungal ) . Patients serious hepatic , and/or renal , and/or cardiac failure basic lung disease functionality organs follow criterion : AST ( GOT ) ALT ( GPT ) high five ( 5 ) time high normal value 200 UI/L ; Blood creatinine high 2,0 mg/dl ; Proteinuira ( qualitative test ) 3+ great , total urinary excretion protein ( quantitative test ) 3,5 g/day high ; Hyperkalemia hypokalemia basic level sodium 6,0 mEq/L great less 2,5 mEq/L ; Hyperlipidemia basic value total cholesterol great 1,5 time high normal value 300 mg/dl , triglycerides high twice high normal value 300 mg/dl ; Patients require infusion leucocyte ; Patients arterial thrombosis serious coagulative dysfunction ; Patients diabetes mellitus associate ketosis ; Pregnant woman woman intend become pregnant , woman purperium , breast feeding ; Patients participate clinical study ( type drug , include anticancer drug ) recruit observational clinical study pharmaceutical agent month begin treatment SPK843 ; Patients , accord doctor , consider fit recruit study .</criteria>
