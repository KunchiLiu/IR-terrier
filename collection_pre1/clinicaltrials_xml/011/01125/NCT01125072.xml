	<brief_summary>Chest pain one common complaint bring patient emergency department ( ED ) . The differential diagnosis chest pain broad include cardiac well non-cardiac disease . One initial goal ED evaluation patient present chest pain rapidly accurately diagnose presence absence acute coronary syndrome . The diagnostic accuracy initial routine evaluation often limited result frequent admission patient present chest pain diagnostic testing . Echocardiography high sensitivity specificity diagnosis acute myocardial infarction . Tissue Doppler image strain strain rate ( SR ) measurement new echocardiographic technique , enable accurate assessment regional leave ventricular systolic diastolic function . Prior study show abnormal strain SR highly sensitive marker ischemia . Acute ischemia induces early systolic thin delay onset systolic thickening , progressive decrease rate degree maximal systolic thickening , abnormal ischemia-related thickening occur aortic valve closure . A major obstacle routine use echocardiography ED need portable study , use heavy , bulky portable echo machine . There currently available portable hand-held echo machine ( GE-Vivid I ) produce high quality image offer opportunity incorporate echocardiography routine practice ED . We propose study use early , portable echocardiography , detailed assessment wall motion leave ventricular function strain strain rate measurement , evaluation chest pain ED . We hypothesize early detailed leave ventricular function assessment highly sensitive specific diagnosis myocardial ischemia , enable rapid triage patient present ED chest pain .</brief_summary>
