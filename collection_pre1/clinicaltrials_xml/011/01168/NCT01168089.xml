	<detailed_description>Maintenance tight glycemic control critically ill patient demonstrate significantly reduce morbidity mortality critical care patient OR ICU setting . Numerous ( &gt; 20 ) peer-reviewed publication demonstrate benefit tight glycemic control . For example , tight glycemic control show reduce surgical site infection 60 % cardiothoracic surgery patient ( Furnary et al. , 1999 ) , show reduce overall ICU mortality 40 % significant reduction ICU morbidity length stay ( Van den Berghe , 2001 ) . Historically , caregiver treat hyperglycemia ( high blood glucose ) glucose level exceed 220 mg/dL . However , base upon recent clinical finding , expert recommend control blood glucose within normoglycemic range ( 80-110 mg/dL ) . Adherence strict glucose control regimens require near-continuous monitoring blood glucose frequent adjustment insulin infusion achieve normoglycemia avoid risk hypoglycemia ( low blood glucose ) . Surveys indicate , response demonstrate clinical need , 50 % US hospital adopt tight glycemic control protocols critical care patient , additional 23 % expect adopt protocol within next 12 month . Currently , TGC protocols require intravenous administration insulin achieve manage glucose control within normoglycemic range . The protocol also mandate frequent monitoring patient blood glucose level nurse staff . With exist technology , test involve removal blood sample test handheld meter blood gas analyzer . This process cumbersome , labor intensive , often disruptive patient . Although hospital respond identified clinical need , current technology limited adoption due two principal reason : 1 . Fear hypoglycemia : administering insulin maintain patient target glucose range 80-110 mg/dL expose patient increase risk clinical hypoglycemia ( blood glucose less 50 mg/dL ) . Critical care patient often sedate exhibit typical sign hypoglycemia , exacerbate risk hypoglycemia . The need frequent monitoring concern risk hypoglycemia increase caregiver stress limit adherence tight glycemic control protocol . 2 . Glucose monitoring conventional method represent burdensome procedure : tight glycemic control protocols require frequent glucose monitoring insulin adjustment 30 minute 2 hour interval ( typically hourly ) avoid hypoglycemia maintain normoglycemia . Glucose determination current technology ( include instrument preparation , blood sample acquisition instrument analysis ) typically take 5 minute per measurement . The Sponsor develop automate patient-attached blood glucose monitor automatically make frequent blood glucose measurement . Frequent measurement allow well track patient glucose status provide blood glucose trend information . The system alert caregiver impend actual hypoglycemia condition . Automation reduce labor burden associate exist technology . The device intend help caregiver well manage tight glycemic control patient . The device measure glucose whole blood flow patient blood sample optical flow cell transmit near infrared light sample . The blood constituent , include glucose , absorb portion near-infrared energy characteristic fashion . The instrument measure result transmission spectrum analyze spectrum determine concentration glucose blood sample . Though propose study represent initial measurement make device ICU patient , Sponsor collect data volunteer study conduct InLight 's facility . In one study , collect blood volunteer donor create individual blood sample variable glucose ( glucose range 50-550 mg/dL ) spiking sample concentrate glucose solution . We also induce hematocrit variation 30-50 % sample control red cell plasma ratio . Spectral measurement collect prototype device mathematically correlate simultaneous blood glucose measurement sample obtain Yellow Springs Instruments YSI 2700 Select glucose analyzer ( industry-standard laboratory glucose analyzer ) generate spectral glucose model provide baseline near-infrared glucose measurement result . This evaluation demonstrate device 's glucose measurement track YSI 2700 glucose measurement accuracy 8.9 mg/dL ( 1 s.d. ) . See Figure 1 . In another study , collect serial blood sample 5 volunteer subject diabetes undergoing dynamic glucose change induce carbohydrate ingestion insulin administration . We obtain spectral glucose measurement blood sample use prototype near-infrared device compare simultaneous blood glucose measurement sample obtain YSI 2700 Select glucose analyzer . The Sponsor 's result compare favorably YSI 2700 result , demonstrate root-mean-squared error ( 1 standard deviation ) 5.9 mg/dL ( Figure 2 ) . This accuracy level comparable current handheld meter technology . We anticipate OR ICU environment present new physiological pharmacological challenge instrument . The propose study essentially screen study give Sponsor insight challenge . Access de-identified ICU chart allow Sponsor correlate glucose measurement measurement error specific pharmacologic therapy physiological event . In manner , propose study effect screen study .</detailed_description>
