	<brief_title>Progression Renal Amyloidosis FMF Relation Serum SAA Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FMF inherit inflammatory disorder typically presented cause recurrent episode fever serositis . Phenotype II , another kind disorder , atypical course , inflammation proceeds without clinical sign . Each FMF attack accompany sharp elevation inflammatory marker serum , serum amyloid A ( SAA ) one . The level inflammatory marker return normal termination attack . The SAA main component amyloid fibrils constantly high level SAA attack ( occurs undiagnosed undertreated disease ) significant risk factor responsible development amyloidosis . On hand , patient phenotype II amyloidosis occur despite absolute absence attack . The kidney one first organ suffers amyloid deposit . The spectrum kidney damage spread wildly mild proteinuria obvious nephrotic syndrome disturbance renal function progression end stage renal failure . It well know deterioration renal disease AA amyloidosis link level SAA serum . The permanently high SAA level major factor responsible progression renal disease . Occasionally , however , decline renal function occur despite normal near normal level SAA . Renal impairment case may explain mechanism exist kidney disease uncontrolled proteinuria aggravates renal dysfunction . The purpose study find whether cohort patient follow clinic receive colchicine FMF- amyloidosis accord SAA level , monitor periodically , good prognosis historical cohort receive colchicine accord attack status</detailed_description>
