	<brief_summary>This observational study non-interventional multi-centre , prospective study . The aim study evaluate Sorin Group new passive- active- fixation pace lead . We plan assess acute short term lead dislodgment rate ( within first three month follow implantation ) correlate type lead ( active- passive- fixation ) . Further , collect data related lead handle lead electrical performance</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study Sorin Group New Brady Leads XFine Beflex</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective observational study ass acute rate dislodgment new Sorin group range active- passive- fixation lead 3 month follow implant . Assessment electrical performance ( pace threshold , sense amplitude , impedance ) lead implant follow-up .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The implanted lead must allow measurement pace threshold 0.5ms , Rwave Pwave amplitude impedance lead . Included patient may receive one lead evaluation . Any contraindication endocavitary lead implantation ; Inability understand purpose study refusal cooperate . Geographically unstable unavailability schedule M1M3 followup implant centre define investigational plan . Patient minor age ( &lt; 18 ) Pregnancy .</criteria>
