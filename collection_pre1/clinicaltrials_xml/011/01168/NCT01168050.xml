	<detailed_description>NILOMEL phase II multicentric uncontrolled open national trial assess efficacy Nilotinib first second line treatment primary melanoma , stage III unresectable melanoma , Stage IV melanomas c-KIT mutation amplification ( case c-KIT amplification , B-RAF N-Ras mutation detect ) . The primary objective overall response rate ( partial complete response ) accord RECIST 1.1 criterion , assess use CT-SCAN ( stage IV melanoma ) MRI ( unresectable melanoma ) 6 month therapy Nilotinib 800 mg/d . Secondary objective include : - Disease control rate ( complete , partial response stable disease ) accord RECIST - Metabolic response rate ( TEP-SCAN ) - Tolerance NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 - Biomarkers associate response disease control ( evaluate M0 , M1 M6 ) . Protein analysis c-KIT , PI3K , MAPK STAT signal pathway well PDGFR Ephrin signal pathway . Patients progressive disease 3 month therapy withdrawn . Patient stable disease 3 month continue Nilotinib evaluation 6 month . Patients stable disease progressive disease 6 month continue Nilotinib progression . The trial plan use one-stage design ( Fleming TR ) . We consider response rate 7.5 % would define null hypothesis efficacy . To detect response rate 30 % power 90 % use one-sided test 0.05 level , 25 patient recruit . Accrual 2.5 year total study duration : 3 year</detailed_description>
