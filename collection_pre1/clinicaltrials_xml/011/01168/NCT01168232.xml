	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Uterine Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate patient persistent recurrent carcinosarcoma uterus treat ixabepilone . II . To determine nature degree toxicity regimen patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient treat regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine expression class III beta-tubulin carcinosarcoma uterus . II . To explore association class III beta-tubulin expression response , progression-free survival , overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue sample prior surgery may collect class III beta-tubulin analysis IHC . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
