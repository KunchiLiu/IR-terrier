	<brief_summary>Background : - Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) common condition people diabetes . DME occur blood vessel eye leak fluid , result swell inside back eye progressive vision loss . Research show good blood sugar control reduce risk severity DME . However , diabetic patient poor blood sugar control develop DME , patient develop DME despite excellent blood sugar control . This suggest factor , gene inherit trait , may predispose protect diabetic patient develop DME . Objectives : - To investigate genetic factor may influence development diabetic macular edema . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age type 2 diabetes , without diabetic macular edema . Design : - The study require one visit National Institutes Health eye clinic . - Participants screen medical history basic eye examination . Individuals certain eye disease DME may allow enroll study . - Participants provide blood sample , receive fluorescein angiography ( injection fluorescein dye , camera take picture dye flow blood vessel eye ) . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study test hypothesis genetic polymorphism vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , erythropoietin ( EPO ) , endothelin-1 ( EDN1 ) receptor advance glycation end product ( RAGE ) gene associate development diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . Study Population : Two hundred case participant DME 200 diabetic control without DME enrol . Design : This longitudinal , genetic association study evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) VEGF , EPO , EDN1 RAGE gene affect development progression DME . All participant provide blood sample , undergo eye examination , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) fluorescein angiography ( FA ) discuss medical , family social history . Case participants DME diabetic control participant without DME allow receive standard-of-care treatment NEI protocol . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome variable genotype frequency SNPs specific gene DME control participant . Secondary outcome serum level VEGF , EPO , EDN1 AGE , plasma biomarkers mRNA ophthalmic measurement ( visual acuity image result FA OCT result ) . The longitudinal outcome measure include investigate association study genetic polymorphism long-term response standard-of-care therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant must meet following criterion : Participant diagnose type 2 diabetes prior enrollment . Participant must understand sign protocol inform consent document agree provide blood sample analysis . Participant must 18 year age older. &lt; TAB &gt; DME Participants ( case ) : Participant diagnose active DME define fluorescein leakage associate either central retinal thickness great 260 micron spectral domain OCT cystic change present OCT. OR Participant evidence focal laser scar indicative prior DME Investigators verify laser therapy perform DME via medical record , fluorescein angiogram photograph . NonDME Participants ( control ) Participant evidence DME define fluorescein leakage associate either central retinal thickness great 260 micron spectral domain OCT cystic change present OCT . Participant evidence focal laser scar indicative prior DME . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participant another retinal disease may confound evaluation DME . Examples include vein occlusion , uveitic macular edema neovascular agerelated macular degeneration . Participant opacity ocular medium , limitation pupillary dilation problem sufficient preclude adequate dilate examination .</criteria>
