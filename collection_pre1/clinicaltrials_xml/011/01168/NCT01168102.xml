	<brief_title>Noninvasive Blood Ethanol Measurement With Infrared Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use abuse alcohol workplace , highway , public place significant national problem affect put risk almost Americans . Alcohol-related accident , crime , incident continue rise United States across world . Each year , alcohol-associated fatality , injury , property loss cost nation billion dollar medical insurance cost , lose wage productivity . Current technology detect screen alcohol use impairment , workplace operating vehicle , raise number concern related accuracy , ease use , reliability field . This technology offer low-cost , non-invasive method measure blood alcohol . The device rely human fluid couple ability verify identity . This greatly preferable current standard , require lengthy procedure costly disposable . InLight Solutions TruTouch Technologies develop compact , robust alcohol sensor derive miniature home glucose meter . Initial conceptual testing , use synthetic data , demonstrate system well 0.01 % BAC error without require costly disposable expose test administrator biohazard . The system offer potential untrained minimally trained operator achieve clinically legally accurate measurement le 30 second . Additionally , autonomous instrument could configure allow identification monitoring alcohol offender without judicial involvement . InLight Solutions technology employ advanced optical tissue sample technique sophisticated multivariate analysis technique ( also know `` chemometrics '' ) quantitative near-infrared spectroscopy . These optical measurement technique employ painless use light direct human tissue measure chemical constituency blood tissue . These technique measure variety blood analytes , include alcohol . An additional capability device able identify subject base upon unique skin spectrum . This capability could use technology use ignition interlock device . Currently , breath alcohol detection device use start ignition interlock . This pose problem due fact user able different `` sober '' person blow device . Our technology could bypass problem use device identify user current blood alcohol level .</detailed_description>
