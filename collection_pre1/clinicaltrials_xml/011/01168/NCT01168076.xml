	<brief_title>Noninvasive Transcutaneous Glucometer Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The feasibility measure blood glucose concentration patient diabetes mellitus use near infrared ( NIR ) spectroscopy multivariate data analysis technique establish use general purpose , scientific-grade infrared spectrophotometer 90-049 UNM HRRC protocol . Now concept painless , bloodless , reagent-less clinical laboratory test show viable , challenge bring technology patient need . We must develop device portable , affordable , rugged - improve accuracy . We must also improve understanding nature glucose whole , intact skin . Since light beam discriminate plasma glucose skin blood vessel glucose large skin interstitial fluid space , exact nature glucose tissue compartment contribute light-beam signal must elucidate . The noninvasive measurement accurate reference measurement base . Finally , find accuracy noninvasive measurement also worsen function time initial measurement . This effect independent instrumentation drift due physical change patient 's skin variation hydration , collagen , vascularity , glycation end-products , etc . To account source physiologic interference must evaluate independently compare error noninvasive prediction time .</detailed_description>
