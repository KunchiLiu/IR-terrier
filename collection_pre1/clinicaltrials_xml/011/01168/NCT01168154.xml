	<brief_title>Role Of Lactobacillus Reuteri DSM 17938 In The Non-Complicated Diverticular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The gastrointestinal apparatus host bacterial population quantifies around 1011 microorganism per gram content 400 different specie . Its principal function : metabolic , trophic , protective . The Lactobacillus reuteri ( ReuterinÂ® ) consider one native specie human intestinal tract . It able modulate immune response CD4+ T-Helper ileum level . Lactobacillus reuteri isolate first time 1980 heterofermantative specie . Its probiotic activity attribute ability exercise inhibitive effect pathogenic micro-organisms combination mechanism include production lactic acid , hydrogen peroxide , antimicrobic substance bactericide . Moreover , Lactobacillus reuteri position produce various short chain-like fat acid acetic acid fermentation carbohydrate . At last , position produce powerful antimicrob substance know Reuterina capable inhibit growth many bacterial specie include Escherichia , Salmonella , Shigella , Proteus , Pseudomonas , Clostridium Sfafilococcus well fungi protozoa , many pathogen man . Among pathology hypothesize probiotic could possible therapeutic role , diverticulosis disease . Approximately 20 % patient colonic diverticula intestinal disturbance reduction quality life . Moreover approximately 20 % patient diverticulosis colon least 1 acute diverticulitis attack , characterize pain , fever , abdominal defence , increment VES neutrophil leucocytosis . Usually acute diverticulitis episode control medical therapy , repeat episode time often lead great complication perforation , abdominal abscess , fistulas stenosis . The prevention acute diverticulitis episodes therefore important prevent great complication pathology . Until , scientific evidence suggest use fibre non-absorbable antibiotic ( rifaximine ) treatment non-complicated diverticular disease prophylaxis fear complication . The extended use antibiotic expose risk select resistant strain long-term study outcome patient suffer diverticulosis continuous therapy rifaximine fibre . The therapy Lactobacillus reuteri could effective control symptom diverticular disease trophic action coloncytes ( thanks SCFA production ) , modulation activity immune system intestinal permeability . Moreover antibacterial activity Lactobacillus reuteri pathogenic bacteria could useful prevention treatment acute diverticulitis episode . Finally , thanks trophic role intestinal epithelium , Lactobacillus reuteri could help mucosal cure acute diverticulitis episode .</detailed_description>
