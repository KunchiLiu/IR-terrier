	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety combination regimen bortezomib-bendamustine-dexamethasone patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Plus Bortezomib Plus Dexamethasone Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After relapse early progression first-line treatment prognosis multiple myeloma patient unfavourable , remain chance cure . Therefore search new treatment regimen , include drug novel , different , mechanisms action mandatory . Both bendamustine bortezomib yet establish part standard first-line regimen , show high activity chemo-naïve pre-treated patient . The novel mechanism action proteasome inhibitor non-cross resistance bendamustine alkylating agent establish first-line treatment multiple myeloma seem recommend combination two drug salvage therapy . The promising response data series relapse MM patient treat bendamustine , bortezomib prednisone support assumption , well feasibility tolerability combination . In summary , evidence favourable risk/benefit ratio combination bendamustine , bortezomib glucocorticoid drug , warrant exploration large , prospectively design multicenter phase II study .</detailed_description>
