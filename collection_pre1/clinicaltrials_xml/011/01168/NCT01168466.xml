	<detailed_description>Objectives Significance 1 . What ( ) primary goal ( ) study The purpose study evaluate efficacy biofeedback training increase regional cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) peak alpha frequency ( PAF ) cognitive behavioral symptom frontotemporal dementia ( FTD ) . We also measure effect EEG driven photostimulation PAF neurofeedback learn high PAF state related clinical outcome . 2 . What ( ) secondary goal ( ) study A diversity clinical , neuropsychological , physiological variable collect study . For instance , full 19-channel quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) assessment perform intake . The relationship EEG power coherence symptom disorder could potentially provide important contribution literature usefulness QEEG differential diagnosis . An additional goal study contribute understand neurofeedback work . For instance , take measurement determine learn control PAF involve awareness internal subjective state relate PAF . Also , effect reward signal brainwave call P300 may show importance reward tone sound majority time neurofeedback session . Finally , measure whether blood flow change EEG biofeedback whether EEG affect blood flow biofeedback . We propose several measurement contribute understand mechanism action neurofeedback . Frontotemporal Dementia Cerebral Hyperperfusion Single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) study show cerebral blood flow significantly reduce frontal temporal region FTD patient ( Miller et al. , 1997 ; Read et al. , 1995 ) . The anatomical distribution reduce CBF corresponds pattern neuropsychological deficit ( McMurtray et al. , 2006 ) . Not surprisingly , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) FTD patient show atrophy frontal temporal region ( Mendez et al. , 1996 ; Neary Snowden , 1996 ) . However , Spilt et al . ( 2005 ) hypothesize neurodegeneration dementia largely secondary pathology cerebral blood flow . When compare elderly control optimal cognitive function , patient DSM-IV dementia differ significantly elderly control respect number cerebral infarction . Demented patient show significantly white matter lesion ( p=.028 ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ; p=.016 ) , reduction cerebral blood flow large effect size ( p &lt; .001 ) . An attempt build logistic regression model show significant residual variance could explain cerebral blood flow include model . Another argument central role blood flow dementia Alzheimer 's patient brain damage ( region MRI signal hyperintensity ) increase oxygen extraction per mL/min . That , blood supply rather demand seem problem . Oxygen extraction would expect unaltered reduce blood flow secondary tissue damage ( Spilt et al. , 2005 ; Yamaji et al , 1997 ) . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image FTD patient reveals reduce glucose metabolism frontal anterior temporal lobe , also cingulate gyrus , insula , uncus , subcortical structure ( Jeong et al. , 2005 ; Garraux et al. , 1999 ; Ishi et al. , 1998 ) . Grimmer et al . ( 2003 ) perform longitudinal study ten patient diagnosed FTD . At initial assessment , FTD patient reduce metabolic activity compare control frontal cortical area , caudate nucleus , thalamus . On 1-2 year follow-up , significant progression original deficit observe orbitofrontal cortex subcortical structure . Given substantial evidence link dementia FTD particular reduce cerebral blood flow , hypothesize train FTD patient increase cerebral blood flow alleviate FTD symptom slow progress disease . Recent study suggest individual learn increase CBF biofeedback . Yoo et al . ( 2006 ) show participant give feedback fMRI activity auditory cortex listen music able significantly increase mean blood oxygenation well number significant voxels . Another study ( deCharms et al. , 2005 ) train participant change fMRI activity rostral anterior cingulate gyrus ( RACG ) , region implicate pain perception . Control condition include sham feedback feedback different brain region . When noxious thermal stimulus apply , participant decrease pain sensation train decrease RACG activity increase pain sensation train increase RACG activity . In another phase study , eight chronic pain patient report decreased pain down-training fMRI region . fMRI cost $ 1000 per session , place form therapy beyond reach patient . However , possible provide CBF neurofeedback outermost 1.5 cm cerebral cortex relatively inexpensive device us refractive property oxygenate hemogoblin red infrared light ( Toomim et al. , 2004 ) . A light source attach scalp ( typically forehead ) headband , 3 cm away infrared sensor , detect relative absorption oxygenate blood . This procedure know hemoencephalography HEG . Toomim et al . ( 2004 ) show ten session improve impulsivity score Test Of Variables Attention ( TOVA ) 28 patient diverse psychopathology . Carmen ( 2004 ) provide frontal HEG 100 migraine patient , find 90 % complete least six session report significant improvement migraine symptom . In single case study , Mize ( 2004 ) report child ADHD show significant improvement IVA , improvement persist 18-month follow-up . Frontotemporal Dementia Peak Alpha Frequency The PAF health adult average 10-11 Hz . Higher PAF associate high memory performance ( Klimesch , 1997 ) , read ability ( Suldo , 2000 ) , vocabulary , response control ( Angelakis et al. , 2004a ) . After series cognitive task , PAF reduce traumatic brain injury patient compare normal control , weakly nonsignificantly reduce compare control task baseline condition . Thus , Angelakis et al . ( 2004b ) argue PAF trait state marker cognitive preparedness . Passant et al ( 2005 ) , Chan et al . ( 2004 ) Yenner et al . ( 1996 ) observe reduction PAF FTD patient . We hypothesize EEG biofeedback reward high PAF result improvement symptom FTD patient . In EEG biofeedback neurofeedback , individual 's real-time EEG present continuously visual auditory signal , desire variation reward . A recent double-blind control study ( Angelakis et al. , 2007 ) show neurofeedback rewarding increase PAF improve cognitive processing speed executive function normal elderly adult . The efficacy neurofeedback therapy demonstrate attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , epilepsy , anxiety , addictive disorder . Other disorder schizophrenia , depression , learn disability ( LD ) , traumatic brain injury investigation candidate neurofeedback therapy ( Monastra , 2003 ) . Frontotemporal Dementia EEG-Driven AVS Like EEG neurofeedback , EEG-dependent auditory visual stimulation ( AVS ) , show promise improve cognitive function modify PAF . A substantial body research demonstrate rhythmic AVS induce EEG rhythm correspond frequency stimulation ( Frederick et al. , 2004 ) . Russell ( 1997 ) report study continuously vary PAF LD ADHD child use signal produce AVS alternately 5 % 5 % PAF 30 second interval , 20 minute session . While theoretical aim study improve flexibility PAF ( change mean frequency ) , show treat PAF effectively treat cognitive dysfunction . These child show significant gain cognitive behavioral measure persist 16-month follow-up . We hypothesize concurrent EEG-Driven photostimulation PAF enhancement neurofeedback ( reward present auditory tone , eye close ) increase rate learn PAF enhancement , increase therapeutic efficacy compare PAF neurofeedback alone . In addition help induce high PAF , rhythmic photostimulation benefit increase CBF induce repetitive wave activation throughout brain . It may therefore also enhance effect HEG training describe part I . Understanding mechanism action neurofeedback could potentially lead refined method treatment improve efficacy . We propose three measurement would contribute improved understanding neurofeedback work . 1 . A common practice EEG neurofeedback reward signal adjusted client spend majority time reward tone . This believe improve motivation compliance , might another reason . When reward tone go , amount rare event require behavioral change . This situation similar design many study show absence expect stimulus evokes positive deflection EEG call P300 wave . The P300 associate orientation reflex , phase-resetting background EEG rhythm . If great P300 reward tone offset observe reward tone onset , would suggest brain responds loss reward electrical signal disrupts reset ongoing EEG activity . This would provide independent physiological support conventional clinical wisdom provide frequent reward . 2 . Some theorist argue efficacy neurofeedback depend normalization abnormal physiology ( e.g. , PAF CBF ) correlate disorder ( Duff , 2004 ) . Others ( Othmer , Othmer Kaiser , 1999 ) argue efficacy neurofeedback result brain 's adaptive response alter brain state induce training . This model similar explain efficacy antidepressant drug , could explain importance multiple session week month train . Thus , measure whether change clinical neuropsychological test variable relate change PAF CBF ( average variance per session ) . The relationship ( lack thereof ) physiological psychological variable study contribute field 's understanding neurofeedback work . 3 . A criticism raise HEG train favor EEG biofeedback blood flow change typically secondary metabolic demand create neuronal activity . Thus , unclear whether HEG feedback train nonspecific EEG activation mechanism involve . We propose measure EEG adjacent HEG training site determine HEG change correlate EEG activation ( enhanced 14-21 Hz reduce 4-7 Hz amplitude , increase PAF ) . It similar interest see HEG blood flow intensity measure increase PAF training .</detailed_description>
