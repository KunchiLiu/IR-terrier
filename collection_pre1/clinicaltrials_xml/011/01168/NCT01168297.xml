	<brief_summary>In 1995 conduct cross-sectional study identify effect traditional western environment prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) obesity Pima Indians Mexico United States . The Mexican Pimas live remote mountainous region time experience little change traditional lifestyle . Nothing know T2DM prevalence . A similar number non-Pima Mexicans live village . In contrast Mexican Pimas , U.S. Pimas live westernize society high prevalence diabetes . We find although T2DM obesity prevalent Mexican Pimas non-Pimas , Mexican group significantly low prevalence disorder U.S. Pimas . The lifestyle Mexican population study include dramatically high level physical activity diet high fiber low calorie derive fat compare U.S. Pimas . Since U.S. Mexican Pimas share similar gene pool conclude even population genetically prone T2DM obesity , development determine largely environmental circumstance . Since 1995 environmental circumstance Mexican Pimas non-Pimas change . The electrical supply region increase , car become prevalent grocery store appear . The impact change T2DM obesity examine . In light event , propose : 1 ) compare current prevalence T2DM obesity Mexican Pimas non-Pima Mexicans present 1995 measure use previously , include height , weight , waist circumference , body composition bioelectrical impedance , oral glucose tolerance HbA1c ; 2 ) compare current diet , physical activity total energy expenditure Mexican Pimas . non-Pima Mexicans use method 1995 study previous result 3 ) document frequency T2DM obesity-associated genetic variant Mexican Pimas compare U.S. Pimas non-Pima Mexicans .</brief_summary>
