	<brief_summary>VHL patient may benefit sunitinib . This study investigate follow objective : PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - To determine objective response rate accord RECIST criterion , VHL patient advance tumor tumor untreatable mean , treat sunitinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - To evaluate safety tolerability sunitinib VHL patient accord NCI-CTC criterion Version 3.0 . - To determine follow time-to-event endpoint : overall survival , time disease progression , progression free survival , time response duration response . - To evaluate quality life VHL patient receive sunitinib .</brief_summary>
