	<brief_summary>Left atrial volume ( LAV ) provide significant prognostic information general population patient heart disease , include acute myocardial infarction , leave ventricular dysfunction , mitral regurgitation , cardiomyopathy atrial fibrillation . Large leave atrial volume , represent chronic diastolic dysfunction , associate poor outcome , regardless systolic function . Thereby , LAV provide long-term view whether patient disease diastolic dysfunction , regardless whatever load condition present time examination , hemoglobin A1C diabetes . However , whether leave atrial ( LA ) parameter could correlate LVFP reflect short-term change leave ventricular filling pressure ( LVFP ) remain unknown . Only one article team confirm relationship LAV LVFP patient severe mitral regurgitation simultaneous echocardiography-catheterization . The prior report propose new parameter , LA distensibility , disclose logarithmic relationship LVFP . The LA distensibility precisely indicate rapid change LVFP patient acute severe mitral regurgitation , even superior mitral E/Em ( early-diastolic mitral inflow velocity divide early-diastolic mitral annular velocity ) . As left atrial pressure rise maintain adequate leave ventricular diastolic filling , increase atrial wall tension tend dilate chamber stretch atrial myocardium . Therefore , small leave atrial stretchability , pressure leave atrium ( LA ) face . The first objective study test value LA distensibility assess LVFP , particularly patient acute myocardial infarction . The second objective ass prognostic value LA distensibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study population : Between December 2007 March 2009 , study enrol AMI patient receive cardiac catheterization potential coronary intervention . AMI define use European Society Cardiology / American College Cardiology guideline . Exclusion criterion follow : 1 ) presence mitral stenosis prosthetic valve , 2 ) mild severity aortic/mitral valvular problem , 3 ) abnormality atrial septum ( e.g. , atrial septal defect aneurysm ) , 4 ) rhythm sinus rhythm 5 ) lack informed consent . Finally , 521 patient participate study final analysis . All patient control give write informed consent participate study , study approve institutional review board Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital . Cardiac catheterization : Before catheterization , patient receive 300 mg aspirin 300 mg clopidogrel . After detail explanation inform consent , patient subject diagnostic coronary angiography via femoral approach follow intravenous injection unfractionated 7500 U heparin . There 46 case require coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) with/without repair procedure due fail percutaneous coronary intervention procedure , severe multiple vessel disease , leave main lesion , cardiac rupture , severe mitral regurgitation post-MI ventricular septal defect . All patient treat successfully primary PCI stenting . Eight patient initially receive primary PCI later treat CABG due failure procedure , severe multiple vessel disease complication ( 46 CABG patient cite included eight patient ) . Coronary angioplasty stenting perform culprit lesion use standard technique bare-metal stent patient . The decision use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor leave discretion treat physician . The measurement LVFP perform via fluid-filled pig-tail catheter place LV coronary angiography PCI indicate primary PCI . The LVFP continuously record ( 50 mm/s ) 6-F pigtail catheter place apex left ventricle take 3 5 end-respiratory cycle patient could tolerate breath hold . The LVFP value calculate mean least 3 consecutive cardiac cycle . Echocardiographic myocardial tissue Doppler measurement : Echocardiography perform immediately LVFP measurement . All study perform experienced sonographers result review staff cardiologist advance echocardiography training . Left ventricular ejection fraction calculate use Simpson 's method biplane image . Pulsed-wave tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) perform use spectral pulse Doppler signal filter , adjust Nyquist limit 15 - 20 cm/s ( approximate myocardial velocity ) use minimum optimal gain . In apical view , 3-mm , pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume place level mitral annulus septal , lateral inferior border . Pulsed-wave TDI result characterize myocardial systolic wave ( Sm ) 2 diastolic wave : early ( Em ) atrial contraction ( Am ) . The pulsed-wave TDI tracing record 5 cardiac cycle sweep speed 100 mm/s use offline calculation . Average Em septal lateral mitral annulus chose estimate LVFP method mitral E/Em . Measurement LA volume : All volume measurement calculate apical four- two-chamber view use biplane area-length method . The LA volume measure three point : 1 ) immediately mitral valve open ( maximal LV volume Volmax ) ; 2 ) onset P-wave electrocardiography ( pre-atrial contraction volume Volp ) ; 3 ) mitral valve closure ( minimal LV volume Volmin ) . The LA distensibility calculate ( Volmax - Volmin ) / Volmin . The LA ejection fraction calculate ( Volp - Volmin ) / Volp . In patient , LA volumes indexed body surface area ( BSA ) . Follow-up : During index hospitalization , cardiovascular death deem event . A follow-up survey assess inhospital mortality hard event carry discharge index hospitalization . Sudden cardiac death , death relate cardiovascular problem , hospitalization related heart define hard event . Death within 1 hour onset acute illness sudden collapse unknown cause diagnose sudden cardiac death . Follow-up perform December 2007 February 2010 telephone interview , medical record review , home visit . Interobserver variability : In first fifty enrol case , Volmax , Volmin , Volp measure two independent observer . Interobserver variability calculate difference value obtain two observer divide mean . Interobserver difference variability Volmax 4.1±5.4 ml 6.6±8.7 % , respectively . Interobserver variability difference , 8.1±8.9 % 2.9±3.2 ml Volmin , 6.7±7.4 % 3.1±3.4 Volp , respectively . Therefore , interobserver variability LA distensibility LA ejection fraction measurement 7.8±6.6 % 3.1±3.2 % , respectively . Statistical analysis : The SPSS software use statistical analysis . Baseline characteristic study patient group accord quartile LA distensibility . All continuous variable present mean ± standard deviation . Analysis variance post hoc test unpaired data use evaluate significance difference group . A p vale &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Comparison clinical characteristic perform chi-square analysis categorical variable . Event-free survival curve generate mean Kaplan-Meier estimate , difference survival compare use log-rank test . To evaluate effect different level LA distensibility in-hospital mortality , hard event , relative risk 95 % confidence interval calculate hazard ratio derive Cox proportional-hazards model . Multivariate model fit use available clinical covariates . The relationship curve LA distensibility LVFP estimate use SPSS software . Bivariate analysis , simple correlation linear regression use appropriate . Receiver-Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis also perform assess sensitivity specificity predict elevate LVFP ( &gt; 15 mmHg ) .</detailed_description>
