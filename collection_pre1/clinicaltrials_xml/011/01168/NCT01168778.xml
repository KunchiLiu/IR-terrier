	<brief_summary>The excessive use outpatient antibiotic pediatric population contribute rapid development resistance many strain Streptococcus pneumoniae . Research show community-based intervention may modest impact reduce injudicious use antibiotic child . However , since actual prescribing antibiotic do physician research show physician-parent communication pattern pediatric visit acute respiratory tract infection ( ARTI ) strongly influence antibiotic prescription rate , crucial develop effective intervention aim specifically . The overall goal study improve physician-parent communication pattern visit pediatric ARTI , ultimately , decrease rate antibiotic prescribing illness child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Communication During Pediatric Visits Acute Respiratory Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal study test novel communication-based intervention aim decrease rate prescribe antibiotic ARTI child . We propose randomize controlled trial involve sample 34 primary care pediatrician draw 8 practice Puget Sound Pediatric Research Network ( PSPRN ) . Our research design incorporate novel physician intervention teach importance specific physician communication behavior . The primary physician outcome study change utilization communication behavior report parent , antibiotic prescribing rate child present ARTI symptom . The primary parent outcome measure study satisfaction care . Changes primary outcome intervention physician compare change outcome control physician . The trial five specific aim five major hypothesis . 1 . To evaluate effectiveness propose intervention achieve state goal change physician communication behavior . - We hypothesize physician intervention group increase report use desirable communication behavior decrease report use undesirable communication behavior relative control group physician . 2 . To determine antibiotic prescribing rate child age 6 month 10 year present ARTI symptom assess rate change function intervention . - We hypothesize physician intervention group decrease antibiotic prescribing rate ARTI relative control group physician . 3 . To determine visit-specific satisfaction level parent child see study physician assess satisfaction level change function intervention . - We hypothesize parent take child physicians intervention group report increase satisfaction care , relative control group physician . 4 . To identify factor ( e.g. , physician communication behavior ) mediate relationship physician intervention group , decrease antibiotic prescribing , increase parent satisfaction care . - We hypothesize increase use desirable communication behavior decrease use undesirable communication behavior partially mediate relationship intervention group physician , decrease inappropriate prescribing , increase parent satisfaction care . 5 . To perform validation study Physician Communication Behavior Inventory ( PCBI ) survey item . Using standardized approach , specific physician communication behavior cod review 100 video tap physician-parent encounter . The behavior cod compare parent response PCBI survey encounter . - We hypothesize parent report physician communication behavior PCBI highly correlate actual physician communication behavior cod video tape data .</detailed_description>
