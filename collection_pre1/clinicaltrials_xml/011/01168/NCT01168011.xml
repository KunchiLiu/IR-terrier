	<brief_summary>This phase 1 study 2 72 patient advanced cancer receive oral dos rigosertib , new investigational ( unapproved ) anti-cancer drug . The objective study determine high dose drug give safely . The study start test low dose . If dose safe , , high high dos test long previous low dose safe . Safety determine look side effect unusual laboratory value . It important know high safe dose additional study do . The drug give form capsule twice three time day 21 consecutive day 21-day cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients initially enrol two-patient cohort start 70 mg bid dose . - In absence drug-related grade 2 high toxicity two patient treat entire 21-day first cycle , next two patient receive dose escalate 100 % prior dose . - If drug-related grade 2 high toxicity observe least one two patient treat full 21-day cycle , cohort expand order obtain 3 evaluable ( treated entire 21-day first cycle ) patient . - If dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) observe first three patient treat entire 21-day first cycle , next three patient enrol dose level increase approximately 50 % prior dose . - If one DLT observe first three patient treat entire 21-day first cycle , three next patient enrol dose level . - If one DLT observe six patient treated entire 21-day cycle , next six patient administer dose level increase approximately 25 % prior dose . - If two patient cohort experience DLT , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) exceed dose escalation occur . The MTD establish immediate prior dose level - Identical rule apply cohort patient recruit study . - A total 24 patient may treat MTD dose level order obtain data onset severity dysuria symptom approximately 12 patient include 6 patient treated oral sodium bicarbonate time treatment initiation ( early treatment ) ~6 patient treat oral sodium bicarbonate time symptom onset ( late treatment ) . Alternating patient 1-to-1 basis enrollment date receive oral sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tablet give twice daily two 8-ounce glass water 1 hour rigosertib administration , either time study initiation ( early treatment ) time urinary symptom onset ( late treatment ) . Three additional cohort treat multiple escalating dos administer orally three time daily ( TID ) ( 140 mg , 280 mg 420 mg ) 21 consecutive day 21-day cycle use identical rule describe ( ie , start 2-patient cohort 140 mg dose expand 3-6 patient cohort least 1 Grade 2 high drug-related toxicity observe 2-patient cohort ) . Up 12 patient may treat MTD level identify TID dosing . Prior escalate next plan dose level , designate Cohort Review Committee ( CRC ) consist Principal Investigators ( representative ) , Medical Monitor Sponsor 's Medical Representative review available safety data 21 day duration Course 1 previous cohort . Additional input may provide study monitor , pharmacokinetic toxicology specialist require . The CRC also ability recommend dose de-escalation ON 01910.Na warrant observed toxicity profile .</detailed_description>
