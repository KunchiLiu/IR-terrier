	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn eltrombopag help increase number platelet patient CLL . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Eltrombopag Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : When number platelet body get low , cause bleeding , may cause serious health problem and/or prevent receiving chemotherapy . Eltrombopag design act like protein body help make platelet . This may help increase platelet count . Study Drug Administration : You take pill study drug mouth 1 time day empty stomach ( 1 hour 2 hour meal ) . You take pill 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You wait least 4 hour take eltrombopag eat food calcium ( dairy product and/or juice add calcium ) take drugs/supplements iron , calcium , aluminum , magnesium , selenium and/or zinc . Other drug may also affect eltrombopag . Be sure tell doctor drug and/or supplement may take . During study visit , doctor check platelet count see improve . If improve , dose study drug may increase . Your doctor instruct dose eltrombopag take . Do take 1 dose eltrombopag one day . If forget take dose , skip miss dose continue regular dosing schedule . Do take double dose make miss one . Study Visits : Each study `` cycle '' 28 day . Each week Cycle 1 , every 2 week Cycles 2 3 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask bleed may occur since last study visit . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 ( +/- 7 day ) Cycles 4 beyond : - You physical exam . - You ask bleed may occur since last study visit . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You also bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease check platelet count . This test perform every 3 cycle . Length Study Participation : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug require treatment CLL intolerable side effect occur . Follow-Up : After stop taking eltrombopag reason , platelet count may drop . This may increase risk bleed . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn week 4 week check platelet count . This investigational study . Eltrombopag FDA approve commercially available use chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP - severe bleeding due platelet destruction immune system ) . The use drug patient CLL investigational . Up 36 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

For patient ITP corticosteroid cyclosporine , dose corticosteroid cyclosporine must stable 2 week prior enrollment plan taper patient respond eltrombopag 10 . Able provide inform consent 1 . Concurrent chemotherapy CLL 2 . Diagnosis Richter 's transformation 3 . Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia i.e . patient AIHA control treatment corticosteroid cyclosporine . This would include patient require PBRC transfusion stable hemoglobin ( HGB ) due ongoing hemolysis . 4 . Concurrent treatment ITP ( except corticosteroid cyclosporine ) 5 . Diagnosis myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia 6 . Active infection significant medical illness determine treat physician 7 .
