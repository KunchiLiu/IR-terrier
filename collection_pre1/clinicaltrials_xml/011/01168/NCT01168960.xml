	<brief_summary>Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) effective treatment alcohol dependence , little known CBT work achieve effect . Although several possible mechanism propose explain effect CBT , rare one mechanism study . However , may case similar outcome ( e.g. , abstinence ) may reach multiple path . Therefore , essential conducting work behavioral change mechanism distinguish different course path moderate influence ( Kazdin , 2007 ) . In present study , focus 2 key mechanism posit underlie effectiveness CBT specifically , increase self-efficacy self-confidence reduce positive outcome expectancy alcohol use , 2 key mechanism posit underlie effectiveness wide range therapeutic intervention , increase therapeutic alliance reducing/regulating negative emotional state . For present study , participant 72 alcohol dependent men woman agree participate 12-week trial CBT alcohol dependence . In addition , comprehensive research assessment conduct patient baseline , end treatment , 3-months posttreatment . Specific Aim 1 . To examine within-treatment week-to-week relationship rating 4 key therapeutic mechanism alcohol involvement ( operationalized percent day abstinent { PDA } drink per drinking day { DDD } ) treatment . It hypothesize self-efficacy , outcome expectancy , therapeutic alliance ( rat patient therapist ) , negative affect assess give treatment session predict alcohol involvement follow week . Exploratory analysis also investigate relationship give week 's alcohol involvement four key variable assess follow week . Specific Aim 2 . To examine profile four key mechanism course treatment relation alcohol involvement treatment 3-month follow-up period . These analysis descriptive/exploratory . It expect profile emerge key mechanism associate decreased alcohol involvement ( example , alliance relatively strong throughout treatment alliance grow strong course treatment , positive outcome expectancy grow weak course treatment , etc. ) . Similarly , hypothesize profile emerge associate little improvement alcohol involvement ( example , negative affect relatively high throughout treatment self-efficacy weaken course treatment ) .</brief_summary>
