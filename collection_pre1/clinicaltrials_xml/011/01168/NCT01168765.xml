Participants assign TSSC medium campaign-only arm study receive welcome TSSC newsletter upon enrollment study , receive exposure TSSC medium campaign community member enrol behavioral intervention trial . This include exposure campaign Clinical Research Unit CCHC data collection via possible view TSSC television segment wait area , availability TSSC newsletter . Other possible TSSC campaign exposure occur general public via radio , television website , use walk trial , go farmer market , etc . Participants assign Promotora plus arm study also receive initial welcome TSSC newsletter , medium campaign material assure aware various medium outlet program campaign .

High Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol determine use precipitation method . Low Density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol calculate Friedewald equation modify use factor triglycerides/5 adult . In case LDL estimate triglyceride less equal 400 mg/dl . Insulin measure use radioimmunoassay ( Diagnostic Products , Inc. , Los Angeles , CA ) insulin resistance calculate use HOMA equation . Total glycosylated hemoglobin Hemoglobin A1c measure use principle boronate affinity high-performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) perform clinical laboratory Valley Baptist Medical Center ( Harlingen , TX ) . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) measure UTSPH-B field research laboratory use ELISA ( Alpha Diagnostics Intl . Inc. San Antonio , TX ) external quality control perform randomly select sample Section Atherosclerosis Lipoprotein Research locate Baylor College Medicine ( Houston , TX ) .
