	<brief_summary>Multivessel disease report occur 40 60 % patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) associate bad prognosis . Multivessel revascularization offer myriad potential advantage enhance collateral blood flow , great myocardial salvage , stabilization lesion potentially vulnerable , achievement complete revascularization , factor associate well prognosis . On hand , prolongation procedural duration , hazard contrast induce nephropathy peri-procedural complication limit widespread practice . To date , observational study focus multivessel revascularization disparity result . Whereas one observe increase adverse cardiovascular event thus recommend , others show neutral result . Stress echocardiography show adequate technique diagnosis coronary artery disease could appropriate tool select lesion need revascularized induce large area ischemia . However , technique also limitation like high operator-dependence . Therefore , investigator seek study complete multivessel revascularization patient STEMI treat mean primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) impact prognosis compare strategy treat non-culprit lesion produce large area ischemia stress test .</brief_summary>
