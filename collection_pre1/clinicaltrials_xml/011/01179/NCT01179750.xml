	<brief_summary>Ultrasonic coagulating shear make perform cut hemostasis operation . It prove laparoscopic gastric resection show significantly shorter operative time less work load distribution , stability bleed introduction ultrasonic coagulating shear . In open gastric cancer surgery , ultrasonic coagulating shear often use lymph node dissection cut small vessel hospital Korea . However usefulness effectiveness fully prove . There one report use ultrasonic coagulating shear open gastrectomy . The report contain small number subject surgical procedure different investigator . The investigator expect reduce operative time blood loss ultrasonic coagulating shear . Ultrasonic coagulating shear also enable u dissect lymph node closure lymphatics . This may reduce amount drainage fluid peritoneal cavity shorten removal time drain , also shorten hospital stay . The objective study evaluate safety benefit ultrasonic coagulating shear open gastrectomy include usefulness effectiveness randomize control , prospective study .</brief_summary>
