	<brief_summary>The investigator take part development simple muscle function test study physical training energy turnover patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , COPD . The investigator find muscle waste COPD related poor prognosis physical training might lead improve , less energy-demanding muscle function . Elderly subject also suffer muscle waste lead frailty , poor autonomy , secondarily , fracture . In planned study investigator validate simple muscle function test ( hand grip strength , heel rise test , voluntary quadriceps muscle strength , 30 walk test balance test ) group relate involuntary , magnet stimulate , test quadriceps force , HRQL , test body composition ( impedance , DXA ) record physical activity . The relation food intake , systemic inflammation , muscle mass function analyse . The study ethically approve started COPD patient expand representative sample elderly . Simple , evaluate muscle function test apply primary care may use early detection muscle dysfunction COPD patient elderly early intervention impair muscle function start . Analyses food intake inflammatory marker might identify factor special importance muscle dysfunction , eventually might lead improved dietary therapy pharmacological intervention .</brief_summary>
