In fact , 12 % 17 % patient adverse drug event within 30 day discharge hospital , 14.3 % readmitted . - A major contributor preventable ADEs failure reconcile pre-admission medication drug prescribe discharge . To avoid preventable ADEs , medication reconciliation require organizational practice hospital accreditation Canada United States . - However , substantial challenge implement medication reconciliation , 87 % patient know drug take , 63 % time staff access outside record community pharmacy primary care physician . As result , 60-70 % medication history contain least one error . - The time resource require obtain community drug profile far outstrip capacity deliver essential service patient . Goal : - Providing medical team capacity electronically retrieve up-to-date community drug list pharmacy optimize accuracy medication history reduce time require reconcile community hospital drug list discharge . - This strategy also identify advise community pharmacy physician change make hospitalization , prescription drug discontinue adverse effect ineffective treatment continue fill .

The primary outcome ADEs , measure follow-up interview 30 day post-discharge , secondary outcomeâ€”re-admission/ ER visit 30 day , assess retrieve complete service utilization file RAMQ . GEE multivariate logistic regression use assess impact discharge medication reconciliation .</detailed_description>
