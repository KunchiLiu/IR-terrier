	<detailed_description>A grow body evidence suggest vitamin D status important biologic process involved maintenance physical function . However , whether remediation vitamin D insufficiency improve physical function potential mechanism involve unclear . Previous vitamin D supplementation trial produce mixed result respect physical function ; however , trial specifically recruit individual vitamin D insufficient potential mechanism action understood well enough appropriately select individual likely benefit . To advance understanding role vitamin D physical function , investigator conduct feasibility pilot study collect key information help design full-scale randomized trial determine whether vitamin D supplementation delay decline physical function . The primary goal pilot study determine cost-effective strategy identify person high risk functional decline insufficient vitamin D level , determine serum vitamin D response vitamin D supplementation regimen design attain sufficient vitamin D level , provide preliminary data key functional measure ( balance , short physical performance battery ( SBBP ) muscle power ) future large study design . A secondary goal begin examine potential mechanism vitamin D supplementation may enhance physical performance muscle contractility explore effect vitamin D supplementation change skeletal muscle gene expression use microarrays .</detailed_description>
