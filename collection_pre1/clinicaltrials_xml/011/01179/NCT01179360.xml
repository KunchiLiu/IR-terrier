	<brief_title>Combined FDG PET/CT Imaging Response Evaluation After Radiochemotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( HNSCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients locally advance , N2 N3 head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) recruit . All subject receive induction chemotherapy undergo baseline integrate [ 18F ] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) scan start concurrent chemoradiation . This baseline assessment optional patient receive neo-adjuvant treatment . All patient undergo dedicate FDG PET/CT protocol 12 week end chemoradiation ( primary endpoint ) . In PET/CT negative patient , 2 monthly control visit perform complemented additional imaging require . All patient undergo PET/CT 1 year complete chemoradiation unless recurrent/residual disease already proven pathologically . Patients PET/CT suspect residual nodal disease must pathological proof nodal involvement ( fine needle aspiration non-operable patient neck dissection others ) salvage chemotherapy start . In subset patient receive induction chemotherapy prior concurrent chemoradiation , additional FDG PET/CT scan perform baseline 1 cycle chemotherapy evaluate metabolic response treatment ( secondary endpoint ) .</detailed_description>
