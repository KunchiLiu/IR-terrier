	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer worldwide approximately 1.2 million new case year . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account great 80 % lung carcinoma Western country . Surgical resection treatment choice patient early stage disease ( Stage I II ) , least 50 % patient relapse locally and/or develop distant metastasis . Furthermore , 70 % patient NSCLC non-resectable time diagnosis due either locally advanced metastatic disease . The long-term prognosis patient NSCLC remain poor overall 5-year survival rate le 15 % . The low survival rate may attribute high incidence unresectable disease presentation inability systemic therapy cure metastatic disease . There clear need improvement treatment NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate objective response rate pazopanib combination paclitaxel treatment subject advance NSCLC . Tumor response assess accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion ( version 1.1 ) . A subject define responder he/she sustain complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) least 4 week time treatment . A subject without post-baseline assessment response consider non-responder . A secondary objective study evaluate safety tolerability pazopanib combination paclitaxel treatment subject advance NSCLC . Safety tolerability endpoint consist evaluation adverse event ( AEs ) , exposure , withdrawal due AEs , dose reduction interruption , change baseline vital sign clinical laboratory parameter .</detailed_description>
