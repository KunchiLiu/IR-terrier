	<brief_title>Bard® LifeStent® Vascular Stent Delivery System Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-arm , non-randomized , prospective , multi-center study use Bard® LifeStent® Vascular Stent Delivery System subject lifestyle-limiting claudication ischemic rest pain candidate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) stenting lesion ( ) infra-inguinal segment ( superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) and/or proximal popliteal artery ) . Subjects treat PTA follow implantation Bard® LifeStent® Vascular Stent . Clinical follow-up subject perform prior hospital discharge , 30-days , 12- , 24- , 36-months post-index procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The subject legal representative inform nature evaluation , agree provision , sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . 2 . Subject agree comply protocolmandated followup procedure visit . 3 . The subject ≥ 21 year old . 4 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative urine serum pregnancy test within seven day prior index procedure . Female subject surgically sterile postmenopausal exempt pregnancy test . 5 . The subject lifestylelimiting claudication ischemic rest pain define : Rutherford Category1 24 ( moderate claudication ischemic rest pain ) . 6 . The target lesion ( ) angiographic evidence stenosis restenosis ≥50 % occlusion ( visual estimate ) amenable PTA stenting . 7 . The total treated segment ( ) must ≤ 240 mm . 8 . The target vessel reference diameter ≥4.0 mm ≤6.5 mm ( visual estimate ) therefore appropriate treatment available stent diameter 6.0 mm 7.0 mm . 9 . There angiographic evidence least one vessel runoff foot ( level malleolus ) . 1 . The subject unable unwilling provide inform consent unable unwilling comply study followup procedure visit . 2 . The subject claudication critical limb ischemia describe Rutherford Category1 1 ( mild claudication ) , 5 ( minor tissue loss ) 6 ( major tissue loss ) . 3 . The subject know contraindication ( include allergic reaction ) sensitivity antiplatelet/anticoagulant medication , nickel , titanium tantalum . 4 . The subject know sensitivity contrast medium amenable pretreatment steroid or/and antihistamine . 5 . The subject history bleeding diatheses coagulopathy . 6 . The subject concomitant renal failure creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL . 7 . The subject concomitant hepatic insufficiency , thrombophlebitis , uremia , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) time study procedure . 8 . The subject receive dialysis immunosuppressive therapy . 9 . The subject participate investigational drug another investigational device study . 10 . The subject another medical condition , , opinion investigator , may cause him/her noncompliant protocol , confound data interpretation , associate limited life expectancy less two year . 11 . The subject extensive peripheral vascular disease , , opinion investigator , preclude safe insertion introducer sheath . 12 . The target lesion ( ) locate within aneurysm associate aneurysm vessel segment either proximal distal target lesion ( ) . 13 . The subject angiographic evidence poor inflow , would deem inadequate support vascular bypass graft . 14 . The subject diagnose septicemia time study procedure . 15 . Patients stent previously implant target vessel . 16 . Bilateral disease native SFA and/or proximal popliteal artery limbs meet inclusion/exclusion criterion plan treat limb within 30 day . Note : One limb may enrol study , second limb plan treat 30day followup visit take place . The limb may enrol limb severe lesion reason treat specific limb need state CRF .</criteria>
