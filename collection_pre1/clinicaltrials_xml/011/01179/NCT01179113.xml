	<brief_title>Esmolol Infusion During Laminectomy : Effect Quality Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A common practice use control autonomic response surgery administer beta-blockers intraoperatively . This practice show effectively blunt autonomic response intraoperative event . Several study show administration beta-blockers decrease intraoperative anesthetic requirement . Additionally , demonstrate several study intraoperative beta-blocker administration may actually decrease postoperative pain score opioid requirement , although result entirely consistent . The mechanism decrease postoperative pain narcotic requirement occurs unclear . It postulate esmolol may possess analgesic-like property , suggest study perform rodent model . It also postulate perioperative beta-blockade may attenuate neuroendocrine stress response surgery , thereby decrease inflammatory response tissue ; however , theory support study stress hormone level measure patient receive beta-blockers compare control group . Several study investigate effect beta-blockade postoperative pain opioid requirement compare beta-blocker treatment group opioid treatment group , include true control group treatment give . Therefore , unclear whether decrease postoperative pain opioid requirement study due true effect beta-blockers whether due effect opioids . Therefore , investigator propose randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study investigator compare esmolol infusion treatment group normal saline infusion control group regard effect postoperative pain opioid requirement . By set study manner , investigator able clearly evaluate effect beta-blockers postoperative pain score opioid requirement . The investigator choose use esmolol short half-life , easy titrate administer infusion , also selective beta-1 receptor , deleterious effect intraoperative hypotension minimize . The investigator choose perform study patient undergo single-level double-level laminectomy prior study investigate effect intraoperative beta-blockers patient chronic pain patient , investigator would like research whether result suggest prior study also applicable patient may chronic pain , patient population likely experience high pain level follow surgery , may benefit reduction postoperative pain level .</detailed_description>
