	<brief_summary>Bone tumor near articular cartilage hard remove sufficiently without damage adjacent joint . The purpose study evaluate feasibility navigation-assisted surgery save joint bone tumor resection curettage . In study , investigator hypothesize computer-assisted surgery feasible method get enough margin joint salvage . Each important intermediate factor either oncologic outcome functional outcome respectively . The investigator design study find proportion patient underwent computer-assisted resection could get enough margin use criterion obtain overlap preoperative postoperative image . The investigator also evaluate whether computer-assisted surgery feasible joint save use criterion include functional outcome .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . First condition benign tumor locate deeply bones extremity , pelvis , anticipate difficulty find tumor ass adequacy resection without aid computerassisted navigation operation . 2 . Second condition violation joint growth plate expect removal tumor due close proximity joint growth plate . In case malignant bone tumor , sufficient preservation joint anatomy require even resection margin 1.5 cm away reactive zone tumor . The sufficient preservation joint define least 1 cm subchondral bone remain tumor resection , 1 cm subchondral bone require fixation allograft subsequent reconstruction . The sufficient preservation joint also define articular surface remove , 50 % articular surface save . Exclusion criteria 1 . Patients deny perform navigation surgery explanation navigation surgery protocol 2 . Medically highrisk patient could withstand long surgical time joint reconstruction 3 . Patients whose feasibility joint preservation fulfill inclusion criterion initial presentation , although tumor size decrease enough fulfill inclusion criterion MRI completion neoadjuvant chemotherapy .</criteria>
