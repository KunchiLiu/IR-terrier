	<brief_summary>Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH ) severe progressive disease high mortality . Although several drug available treatment PAH none offer cure , therefore still high medical need new treatment . Soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) one chemical involve pathway control vascular tone , impaired patient PAH . This cause constriction thicken blood vessel wall lung increase blood pressure lung . This lead debilitating symptom PAH tiredness , shortness breath exertion , collapse often inability patient perform daily life activity . Inhalation Nitric Oxide , activate sGC use treat PAH , effect wear soon inhalation stop . Direct stimulation sGC use new compound Riociguat may new approach treatment PAH . The phosphodiesterase 5 ( PDE5 ) -inhibitor Sildenafil one license treatment PAH . The Patent Plus double-blind , placebo-controlled safety study , design investigate effect Riociguat blood pressure patient PAH give combination Sildenafil .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Main objective : Evaluation pharmacodynamic effect combination Sildenafil Riociguat blood pressure safety parameter patient symptomatic PAH Secondary objective : To investigate safety riociguat/sildenafil combination change 6-minute walk test , World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class , N terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide , variable obtain right-heart catheterization 12 week treatment ; pharmacokinetics riociguat sildenafil . The study consist one part . In study Part 1 subject ( 18 ) stable sildenafil treatment 20 mg tid enrol . Study Part 2 start .</detailed_description>
