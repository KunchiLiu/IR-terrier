	<brief_summary>Until assume regular endurance training positive influence cardiac function positive effect increase increase intensity . However , little known effect intense endurance stress heart . According current knowledge repeat exposure strenuous endurance activity may lead minor possibly irreversible damage heart resultant scar heart 's muscle . Within study attempt find different analytical method - particular magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound heart - extent heart muscle affect intense endurance exercise , i.e . `` Jungfrau-Marathon '' , change possibly find . Due repeat measurement obtain information short-term course possible change . Hypotheses : A single bout prolong strenuous exercise ( PSE ) lead transient alteration cardiac function accompany appearance biomarkers myocardial damage .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Despite well document cardio-protective effect aerobic exercise moderate intensity , short- long-term consequence strenuous exercise less clear . There increase evidence maintain high cardiac workload prolong duration may result transient impairment cardiac function . Recent study also report transient increase cardiac biomarkers prolong strenuous exercise . While patient cardiac disease presence cardiac dysfunction increase cardiac biomarkers generally reflect myocardial damage , impact observation athlete ill define . It matter concern whether athlete finding simply reflect reversible response whether repetitive event may lead accumulative cardiac damage . Traditional echocardiographic method use determine potential cardiac change morphology function investigator-dependent may subject interference cardiac pre- afterload . Cardiac magnetic resonance image provide investigator-independent objective method quantify cardiac dimension function . Delayed contrast enhancement MR image highly reproducible cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging technique directly visualize myocardial edema , necrosis fibrosis . Objective To use cardiac delay contrast enhancement magnetic resonance image combination echocardiographic method quantify cardiac dysfunction single competitive PSE event study post-exercise change morphology function well post-exercise dynamic specific marker myocardial damage . Methods Cardiac delay contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging use combination echocardiographic method repetitively investigate post-exercise cardiac function morphology 10 elite athlete finish `` Jungfrau Marathon '' . Biomarkers myocardial damage assess simultaneously . Post-exercise dynamic outcome parameter follow minimum 7 day exercise .</detailed_description>
