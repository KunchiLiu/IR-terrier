	<brief_summary>Treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) major public health problem . Current therapeutic option patient population remain limited . With available treatment , sub-set patient achieve antidepressant response likely achieve treatment-induced remission . The need antidepressant medication provide rapid long lasting relief TRD symptom widely recognize . There new evidence drug block NMDA glutamate receptor ( NMDA antagonist ) promise candidate meet need . Existing study TRD use low-dose , brief infusion ketamine would expect re-sensitize NMDA receptor ; agreement theory , prior study find temporary improvement depression . Our key hypothesis higher-dose , longer-term ketamine infusion , use chronic pain study , would provide robust last improvement depression . Accordingly , test whether 100-hour ketamine infusion would effective standard 40-minute ketamine infusion currently use TRD study . We randomize subject one 2 arm : ( 1 ) 100-hour ( +/- 4 hour ) ketamine infusion plus clonidine entire infusion ( 2 ) 40-minute ketamine infusion ( plus clonidine ) follow 100+/- hour saline infusion . All subject receive clonidine , alpha-2 agonist , minimize side effect ketamine ( namely , brief/mild psychotic cognitive symptom ) . A subset 20 patient TRD receive 100-hour ( +/- 4-hours ) ketamine infusion head MRIs pre ( 2 ) post ( 1 ) infusion . Little research do mechanism ketamine 's putative antidepressant action . There consensus , early stage novel treatment development depression , clinical study pair mechanistic study ( neuroimaging ) understand underlie mechanism validate treatment target . Ketamine think antidepressant effect increase synaptic connection therefore increase connectivity critical cognitive/emotional circuit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This experiment pilot study involve 20 healthy male female age 18-65 test whether 100-hour ketamine infusion plus clonidine would effective , longer last result , standard 40-minute ketamine infusion ( plus clonidine ) . Each 2 arm , evaluate use subject , double-blind , randomized design . An additional subset 20 non-randomized patient , separate original randomize clinical trial ( RTC ) , receive MRI pre post ketamine infusion . 1. . Controlled 100-hour IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior infusion 2. . Controlled 40-minute IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior infusion c. 100-hour ( +/- ) IV placebo ( saline ) infusion 3. . Controlled 100-hour IV ketamine infusion b. clonidine safener PO prior infusion c. MRI pre post ketamine infusion In condition neuroimaging subset , participant admit Washington University School Medicine Clinical Research Unit Barnes-Jewish Hospital approximately 108-hours ( Monday morning-Friday evening ) . Pulse , blood pressure , pulse-oximetry , electrocardiogram strip routinely monitor . Serial labs clinical/safety rating do pre- , , post-infusion , last assessment use assure subject return `` baseline '' prior discharge research unit . Participants continue see primary psychiatrist throughout study .</detailed_description>
