	<brief_title>Incidence Bacteremia Following Argon Plasma Coagulation Patients With Endobronchial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacteremia well-recognized invasive medical condition . In case , transient phenomenon without clinical consequence . In certain patient , structural cardiac abnormality , may lead development infectious endocarditis . According American Heart Association statement , routine endocarditis prophylaxis indicate prior invasive procedure relatively high bacteremia rate , dental care , certain type catheterization rigid bronchoscopy [ 1 ] .Fibreoptic bronchoscopy , without biopsy include list due low bacteremia rate [ 1 ] .This even apply particularly high risk patient prosthetic valve previous endocarditis . Yigla et al . assess incidence bacteremia follow bronchoscopy find 6.5 % bacteremia rate . ( 2 ) Recently , Steinfort et al . assess bacteremia rate follow endobronchial ultrasound find 7 % bacteremia rate following procedure . All bacterial isolates typical oropharyngeal commensal organism . The transbronchial needle aspiration wash culture positive 35 % patient . However , none bacteremic patient clinical feature suggestive infection complication see among cohort . ( 3 ) No data available , however bacteremic rate follow interventional bronchoscopy endobronchial obstruction advance lung carcinoma . In case , palliative set alleviate central airway obstruction , laser resection , electrocautery , argon plasma coagulation stenting technique provide immediate relief . Argon plasma coagulation ( APC ) use ionize argon gas jet flow conduct electron allow noncontact mode treatment ( lightning effect ) . ( 4 , 5 ) APC popular gastrointestinal endoscopy superficial coagulation large mucosal surface . The argon gas quite flexibly flow around bend corner . Coagulated tissue high resistance automatically drive argon gas flow away nearby untreated tissue . An immediate effect really see electrocautery treatment , correspond well histological effect coagulative necrosis . We therefore conduct prospective study assess bacteremic rate follow APC patient endobronchial involvement .</detailed_description>
