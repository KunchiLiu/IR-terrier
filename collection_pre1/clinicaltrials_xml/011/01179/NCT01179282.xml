	<brief_title>Repeated Nasal Challenge Skin Prick-puncture Negative Intradermal Positive Dust Mite Allergic Rhinitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient see outpatient setting . After skin testing , subject meet establish criterion place study . Subjects use dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extract placebo nasal spray home 2 week , 1 month washout period follow 2 week nasal spray . Both patient investigator blind spray use . Subjects monitor symptom use symptom score card return research unit first second week challenge review symptom clinical assessment . If symptoms increase sufficiently make subject uncomfortable , return earlier . Testing consist peak nasal inspiratory flow rate nasal lavage PGD2 ECP . Subjects test perform begin study , end week 1 2 . One group subject clinical history perennial rhinitis symptom associate dust exposure associate perennial allergen . These subject ppt negative intradermal skin test positive Dp . The group subject control group . They healthy history rhinitis rhinitis symptom . They skin test negative . This group also perform nasal challenge placebo Dp extract three time daily 2 week . This group also perform test rhinitis group . In study research design prospective randomize double blind placebo control study . One addition experimental control group use type nasal spray , Dp extract placebo nasal challenge . Each group use one type spray crossover spray . Study Population Inclusion Criteria Gender : Male female Females eligible participate currently non-pregnant non-lactating . Female subject enrol plan become pregnant time study . Age : 18-65 year age enrollment Literacy : The subject must able read , comprehend , record information English . Consent : The subject must ability give informed consent . Type subject : The subject must see outpatient setting . Skin test : The subject must ppt negative intradermal positive Dp dust mite allergen define orthogonal wheal 6 mm great saline negative control . Rhinitis : The subject must history consistent allergic rhinitis symptom least 1 year . Exclusion Criteria Ppt positive major seasonal allergen ; oak , cypress , cedar , Australian pine , bayberry tree pollen . Respiratory Instability : Hospitalization respiratory disease within last 6 month prior entry study . Respiratory Disease : Current diagnosis asthma , cystic fibrosis , pneumonia , pneumothorax , atelectasis , pulmonary fibrotic disease , chronic bronchitis , low respiratory abnormalities.Respiratory Tract Infections : Confirmed suspect infection nose , sinus , middle ear , oropharynx , upper respiratory tract , low respiratory tract within 28 day prior test . Other Concurrent Conditions/Diseases : Any clinically significant , uncontrolled condition disease state , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation result condition/disease exacerbate study . The list conditions/diseases result exclusion determine clinically significant include , limited : cardiac arrhythmia ; congestive heart failure ; coronary artery disease ; Addison 's disease ; diabetes mellitus ; dyspnea ; uncontrolled hypertension ; hematological , hepatic , neurological , thyroid , peptic ulcer , renal disease ; immunologic compromise ; current malignancy ; tuberculosis . Physical Exam : Subjects nasal polyp , sinusitis , significant anatomic abnormality infection upper airway exclude . Recruitment Plan Screening occur participate clinical center . Screening include subject list exist registry , refer healthcare professional , respond IRB approve advertisement . Nasal symptom score demographic information verify , subject 's interest participating study discuss . Screening may take place person telephone . Summary visit subject Visit 1 Subjects give symptom score card calculate baseline symptom score home every night bed 7 day . ( Table 2 ) Skin test DP dust mite allergen perform . Subjects ppt negative intradermal positive proceed . Subjects complete physical exam . ( Table 1 ) Visit 2 subject average baseline symptom score less 7 15 total point proceed . Subjects complete physical exam . ( Table 1 ) Baseline PNIF nasal secretion collection perform order . Subjects assign nasal spray ( placebo dust ) use home three time daily morning , afternoon , even 2 week instruction give use . Subjects self-administer nasal spray placebo start dose Dp 500 AU/mL nostril observation . If challenge positive increase symptom score great equal 3 baseline ; PNIF nasal secretion collection repeat 15 minute . Subjects assign score card record nasal symptom bed study day base previous 24 hour . Visit 3 After 2 week nasal spray usage subject return clinical research unit test consist PNIF nasal secretion collection . Subjects return test weekday 2 week symptoms increase sufficiently make uncomfortable . Nasal spray bottle weigh symptom score card review monitor compliance . Subjects complete physical exam . ( Table 1 ) Visit 4 After 4 week ( washout period ) ; subject calculate baseline symptom score home every night bed 7 day . On 5th week subject return clinical research unit physical exam , baseline PNIF nasal secretion collection . Subjects assign ( crossover ) nasal spray ( placebo Dp ) use three time daily 2 week instruction give proper use . Subjects self-administer nasal spray placebo start dose D500 AU/mL nostril observation . If challenge positive increase symptom score great equal 3 baseline ; PNIF nasal secretion collection repeat 15 minute . Subjects assign score card record nasal symptom last 24 hour bed study day Subjects complete physical exam . ( Table 1 ) Visit 5 After 2 week assign nasal spray usage subject return clinical research unit PNIF nasal secretion collection . Subjects return test weekday 2 week symptoms increase sufficiently make uncomfortable . Nasal spray bottle weigh symptom score card review monitor compliance . Subjects complete physical exam . ( Table 1 ) Methods Skin Testing Medications know affect skin test response withhold prior testing . Ppt intradermal test do Dp dust mite allergen , saline , histamine control . Criterion positive ppt result wheal diameter 3 mm great saline negative control . Criterion positive intradermal skin test result wheal 6 mm great saline negative control . Allergen control skin test read 15 minute . Ppt use standardize Dp ( 10,000 AU/mL ; Greer Laboratories , Lenore , NC ) , glycerinated phenol saline ( negative ) histamine ( positive ) control ( histamine base= 1.8 mg/mL ) upper back . The minimum positive control 3mm wheal diameter . Intradermal test upper arm use standardize Dp ( 1,000 AU/mL ; Greer Laboratories , Lenore , NC ) , glycerinated phenol saline ( negative ) histamine ( positive ) control ( histamine base= 0.1 mg/mL ; Greer Laboratories , Lenore , NC ) Testing technique Ppt : The GreerPickâ„¢ load extract inspected ensure small droplet extract present tip device . While hold 45 degree angle skin test site , tip bring contact skin . The tine press make contact superficial skin , withdraw slight lift skin . A properly apply prick test result small pricking epidermis , result bleeding . The device discard suitable biohazard container . Intradermal testing : The volume solution inject 0.05mL . The disposable 0.5mL syringe 27 gauge needle tip insert 30 degree angle superficial skin layer . The solution inject maintain steady pressure plunger volume completely inject needle withdrawn . A distinct injection bleb observe . If leakage around needle , indistinct bleb subcutaneous injection occur , test repeat different site . A tiny drop extract injection site common affect test result . Peak nasal inspiratory flow rate ( PNIF ) PNIF measure use method describe package insert In-Check Nasal Inspiratory Flow Meter ( Clement Clarke , Harlow , England Issue 2 , 05/2000 ) . The subject exhale fully , hold device horizontally , ensure face mask form air tight seal around nose , inhale forcibly nose . This maneuver short , sharp inspiratory action one-second duration . The test repeat 3 time high result record . The clinical research unit staff observe possible obstruction call nasal valve . This occur inspiration nostril ( ) close obstruct inspiration . The test repeat occurs .</detailed_description>
