	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand cause chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) determine around secondhand cigarette smoke cause swell sinus . To answer question , invite healthy volunteer , volunteer chronic sinusitis , volunteer chronic sinusitis nasal polyposis complete questionnaire undergo series test . These test measure allergy , exposure cigarette smoke swell sinus . We ask take part one group . About 166 people take part research study . All subject enrol Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) . The Flight Attendants Medical Research Institute ( FAMRI ) Harvard Clinical Translational Science Center Harvard Catalyst ) pay study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pathogenesis Chronic Sinusitis Relationship Tobacco Smoke Exposure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic sinusitis one prevalent chronic illness United States significant health concern term public health care expenditure . We wish learn pathogenic factor cause contribute chronic sinusitis . One factor secondhand smoke ( SS ) exposure . However , several factor involve , include allergic , environmental , genetic microbiologic factor give patient , several factor may contribute disease . One goal see whether specific pattern inflammatory cell , cytokine chemokines exist differentiate causative factor help u good understand individual contribution disease . Several inflammatory cell , cytokine chemokines present chronically inflamed sinus tissue , believe form basis disease process . At present , know little drive sinus tissue . We believe type inflammatory cell , cytokine chemokines elicit disease depend incite stimulus . Cigarette smoke well-documented deleterious effect respiratory mucosa could promote development chronic sinusitis . These include reduction normal mucociliary function ; increase nasal airway resistance ; induction mucin gene expression induction chronic inflammation . In proposed study , extend previous finding investigate relationship SS exposure inflammatory marker also examine relationship cytokine expression particular mucin . Extracts cigarette smoke show induce numerous proinflammatory effect respiratory epithelial cell either vivo vitro . In study analyze gene expression inflammatory marker nasal mucosal biopsy . Our intent study sinusitis rather rhinitis . Nonetheless , examine nasal rather sinus mucosa largely owe difficulty pose obtain sample directly sinuses . Furthermore , recent consensus report emphasize importance view sinusitis continuum nasal sinus mucosal inflammation . These argument put forward term concept `` one airway , one disease '' emphasize commonality mucosal inflammation see upper airway ( rhinitis , sinusitis ) low airway ( asthma ) . The biopsy come middle turbinate . The latter structure pseudostratified columnar epithelium virtually identical appearance maxillary ethmoid sinus mucosa . We use biopsy middle turbinate several previous study chronic sinusitis , primarily comparative tissue represent `` healthy '' sinus mucosa .</detailed_description>
