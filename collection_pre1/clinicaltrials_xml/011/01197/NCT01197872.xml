	<brief_title>Clinical Use Parental Support To Detect Single Gene Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study follow previous IRB approve study IVF008 : Clinical Use Parental Support To Detect Single Gene Mutations , refer `` Phase I '' . The purpose Phase I validate clinical use PS detect specific genetic mutation ( ) know cause severe inheritable disease embryos produce at-risk couple , simultaneously test embryos aneuploidy . The Phase I study consist first kind PGS/D test detect disease-associated genetic mutation together aneuploidy screen . This study , call `` Phase II '' , allow patient continue access test clinical data collect Phase I . Phase I study near enrollment target ( 40+ participate couple ) Phase I enrollment closed subject complete test study data collect pregnancy livebirths . Phase II allow : 1 ) additional data collection prior commercial test launch , 2 ) eligible patient participate receive testing .</detailed_description>
