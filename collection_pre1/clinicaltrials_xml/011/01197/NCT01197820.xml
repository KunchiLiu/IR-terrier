	<detailed_description>Liver kidney tumor represent major health problem patient unsuitable curative treatment surgery . Thus , percutaneous ablation , use radio frequency ( RF ) , prefer : interstitial electrode delivers alternative current place tissue . Consequently , development accurate completely non-invasive method base MR guide HIFU treatment particular interest since energy source locate outside body . There incision . For patient , provide treatment option reduce trauma improve quality life , society , provide reduced hospitalization time reduce cost . MRgHIFU already test clinically tumor immobilize tissue uterine leiomyoma . However , several technological challenge exist apply treatment liver kidney especially challenge related motion organ . In order improve therapeutic efficiency safety intervention , real time map temperature thermal dose appear offer best strategy optimize intervention provide clinical therapy endpoint . Among image modality , MRI Proton Resonance Frequency base method appear ideal tool temperature mapping . One major drawback PRF thermometry high sensitivity motion . Therefore motion correction necessary use PRF thermometry mobile organ liver kidney . To correct artefact generated temperature map periodical organ motion , new technique develop IMF lab Bordeaux University Hospital . The primary outcome study evaluate precision multiplanar MR image real time motion compensation hepatic renal tumour patient . Secondary outcome : - Characterization 3d movement tumour test image improve imaging plan contain main axis movement . - Ballistic : need identify anatomical structure way HIFU beam order define type tumour suitable future treatment - Another outcome define modification need order treat patient depth treatment , power level . We also need see target , rib , transducer order evaluate number transducer element turn treatment .</detailed_description>
