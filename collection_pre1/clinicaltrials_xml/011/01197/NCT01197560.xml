	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Patients With Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study patient diagnose Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) respond ( refractory ) come back chemotherapy treatment ( relapse ) . Lymphoma cancer type blood cell call lymphocyte . DLBCL one type lymphoma . Within DLBCL two different subtypes call Germinal Center B-cell ( GCB ) non-GCB determine cell surface marker test gene expression test . Scientists look cell gene laboratory see two kind different , n't know yet difference mean . To patient doctor two kind seem . Right doctor n't usually test find kind patient treatment . This study two stage , 1 2 . The main purpose Stage 1 separate patient subtype test whether patient take lenalidomide one four drug well response . It possible lenalidomide work well one drug zero , one , subtypes . Stage 2 test subtype ( ) Stage 1 show good response lenalidomide . The main purpose Stage 2 test long patient disease free lenalidomide compare one four drug . On 29 January 2013 enrolment goal Stage 1 portion study meet enrollment stop . The final analysis Stage 1 perform 04 Jul 2013 data cutoff date . According Stage 1 result assess independent response adjudication committee ( IRAC ) , neither subtype met pre specify requirement study Stage 2 . Additionally , suitable assay selection participant Stage 2 study available . Therefore , 6 January 2014 , Celgene decide open Stage 2 .</detailed_description>
