	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Cystocele Plication Risks ( `` CPR Trial '' ) : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaginal prolapse common problem woman . Approximately 11 % woman undergo pelvic reconstructive surgery either pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence [ 1 ] . Several surgical technique correction prolapse evolve scientifically evaluate . However , many basic surgical gynecological principle technique pass generation without scientific evaluation . The technique transvaginal repair cystocele due anterior midline defect traditionally include four step : 1. mobilization defect ( i.e . separation vagina bladder ) ; 2. reduction defect ( i.e . placement plicate suture pubocervical fascia ) ; 3. trim redundant vaginal tissue ; 4. reapproximating vaginal mucosa [ 2 , 3 ] . Although surgeon may modify step ( ex . Depth dissection , location number suture ) , principles consistent . The existence pubocervical fascia need placement plicating suture bladder question , vaginal surgeon omit step [ 4-6 ] . The cited benefit bladder plication great cure cystocele . Some potential risk plication include ureteric obstruction , suture near ureteric orifice , void dysfunction suture near urethrovesical junction [ 3 , 7 ] . A chart review patient Mount Sinai Hospital , underwent typical pelvic floor repair , include transvaginal cystocele repair mid-urethral sling , show approximately 50 % patient experience short-term postoperative voiding dysfunction ( non-published data ) , increase length hospitalization , cost anxiety among patient . This pilot trial assess short-term risk cystocele plication , assess trial feasibility . Ideally large subsequent trial ass cure cystocele one year surgery . To best knowledge , first study assess short-term post-operative outcome woman undergo procedure . 3- Research Question In woman cystocele due anterior midline defect , cystocele plication ( independent variable ) result less patient require catheterization beyond postoperative day 2 ( dependent variable ) compare plication ? Hypothesis The hypothesis may short-term void dysfunction ureteric obstruction follow cystocele repair plication follow cystocele repair without plication . 4- Population Interest Sampling Methods Inclusion criterion : Patients 18 75 year , undergo surgery Mount Sinai Hospital include cystocele repair , eligible . Exclusion criterion : Patients exclude surgeon place anterior vaginal mesh mid-urethral sling , and/or prior surgery anterior vaginal wall prolapse and/or stress urinary incontinence . Recruitment strategy : The patient recruit Mount Sinai Hospital Urogynecology Department . Approximately 4 6 eligible patient see per week estimate least one patient recruit per week . The study complete approximately two year . This single centre study conduct Mount Sinai Hospital , Toronto , Canada . 5- Manoeuvre Study Design This study double blind , randomize controlled trial patient undergoing transvaginal repair midline cystocele , without concomitant correction prolapse vaginal compartment , without correction stress incontinence . All patient provide write informed consent participation . At baseline , participant undergo standardized evaluation , include urogynecologic history , pelvic organ prolapse quantification examination , urodynamic evaluation . The urodynamic evaluation include measurement post-void residual urine volume catheter and/or ultrasound bladder scan , uroflowmetry , fill cystometrogram urethral pressure profilometry . Patients randomize intraoperatively use computer-based randomization . At time surgical step bladder plication , computer program use , indicate whether suture place omit . Trimming redundant vaginal mucosa perform randomization avoid bias result amount mucosa remove . Standardized surgical technique - Midline vaginal mucosal incision - Sharp surgical dissection vagina pubocervical fascia . - Completion prolapse repair vault , rectocele , uterine prolapse . - Manual reduction prolapse trim redundant vaginal mucosa . - Open envelope determine group allocation . - If randomization plication , place midline interrupt suture 0 2-0 polyglycolic acid suture . - Administer indigo carmine 5 ml IV . - Cystoscopy 70º telescope . - Close vaginal mucosa run interlock 0 2-0 polyglycolic suture . Protocol On postoperative day 1 , patient Foley catheter remove measurement post-void residual urine volume do ( either catheterization , suprapubic ultrasound via Bonnano suprapubic catheter ) . Catheterization continue residual volumes less 200 ml twice row . Registered nurse mask treatment assignment perform post-operative assessment examination . 6- Outcomes Primary Outcome Measures The primary outcome variable requirement catheterization beyond postoperative day 2 . This chosen primary outcome since would delay usual hospital discharge postoperative day 2 , thus present practical problem patient ( important base patient value expectative pelvic organ prolapse surgery ) , physician , hospital ( cost ) . Other Outcome Measures A secondary outcome intraoperative ureteric obstruction . All patient , regardless study arm , undergo intraoperative cystoscopy follow intravenous administration indigo carmine order identify complication . If complication occur suspect plicating suture ( ) remove , replace centrally , cystoscopy repeat ensure ureteric permeability . Analysis Sample Size A chart review patient Mount Sinai Hospital , underwent typical pelvic floor repair , include transvaginal cystocele repair mid-urethral sling , show approximately 50 % patient experience short-term postoperative voiding dysfunction . In order provide convince evidence may benefit omit plicate suture , study power detect substantial difference void dysfunction - 50 % patient 25 % patient . Using chi-square distribution alpha error 0.05 , require sample size 58 patient per group . ( SAS 9.2 ) Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis perform use SAS 9.2 Windows™ . Chi-square analysis use evaluate categorical variable T-Tests continuous variable . Data Management The data collect database . Statistical analysis conduct use SAS 9.2 . All data keep confidential protect . Ethical Issues Written consent obtain participant . All data anonymous cod participant identification number . An ethics proposal submit Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board prior begin recruitment . Patients question concern free contact research assistant representative ethic board clarification . The contact information note consent form .</detailed_description>
