	<brief_summary>We hypothesize delay graft function ITBS event may relate small blood clot ( microthrombi ) collect kidney liver cardiac death . Treatment DCD organs thrombolytic agent prior implantation may reduce post-transplant morbidity mortality , may ultimately result great number transplantable liver kidney .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Donated After Cardiac Death ( DCD ) Utilization With Thrombolytic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The wait list kidney liver transplantation continue increase United States , therefore need grow additional donor organ . Utilization organ donate cardiac death ( DCD ) could one way increase organ availability , however risk associate poorer clinical outcome , include delay graft function liver specifically , ischemic-type biliary stricture ( ITBS ) . We hypothesize delay graft function ITBS event may relate small blood clot ( microthrombi ) collect kidney liver cardiac death . Treatment DCD organs thrombolytic agent prior implantation may reduce post-transplant morbidity mortality , may ultimately result great number transplantable liver kidney .</detailed_description>
