	<brief_title>Pain Modulation Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) - Influence Adalimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) RA characterize joint inflammation cause peripheral pain , however relation peripheral pathology pain intensity weak . There substantial evidence also pain modulation mechanism dysregulated RA . For example , generalize pain frequency high RA normal population , 15 % compare 3 % . Earlier data group show change pattern pain-modulation establish RA compare early RA control ( Keystone 2004 ) . There several treatment RA direct relieve symptom ( NSAIDs ) well modify disease ( DMARDs biologics ) . One establish biologics Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -blocking agent adalimumab proven efficacious decrease disease activity retardation joint destruction RA ( Keystone 2004 , Weinblatt 2006 ) . In addition , adalimumab proven efficient reduction fatigue RA ( Yount 2007 ) Pain mechanisms rheumatoid arthritis Pain RA traditionally regard nociceptive pain due peripheral inflammation joint ( arthritis ) . However , although affected joint typically inflamed swollen , peripheral pathology fully explain amount pain patient experience ( Thompson 1997 ) . Central nervous system ( CNS ) mechanism implicate pain experience RA patient previously able demonstrate generalise increase pain sensitivity RA patient ( Leffler 2002 ) . The importance CNS change endogenous pain modulation ( i.e , facilitation , central sensitisation/disinhibition ) underscore high co-morbidity RA generalise pain syndrome fibromyalgia ( FM ) ( Neumann Buskila 2003 ) , specific dysfunction endogenous pain modulation document . The pronounced co-morbidity FM rheumatic inflammatory disease , fact generalise increase pain sensitivity report patient long ( &gt; 5 year ) short ( &lt; 1 year ) duration RA ( Leffler 2002 ) suggest disturbance pain modulation also important pain perception many patient RA . Endogenous pain inhibitory mechanism physiologically closely link autonomic nervous system activity . The type autonomic nervous system dysfunction ( i.e. , basal sympathetic hyperactivity hyporeactivity ) report RA patient ( Evrengul 2004 , Goldstein 2007 ) FM patient ( Cohen 2001 ) . Besides pain regulation , recent study focus involvement autonomic tone also systemic inflammatory response . A major breakthrough characterization cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway . Efferent activity vagus nerve lead systemic release acetylcholine ( ACh ) . Specific bind alfa 7 nicotinic ACh receptor tissue macrophages efficiently inhibits release proinflammatory substance TNF , IL-1 , IL-6 IL-8 ( Tracey 2002 ) . This inflammatory reflex pathway rapid , localize integrate contrast well define humoral regulation inflammation . Dysfunction autonomic regulation , relative reduction vagal tone feature RA proven correlate systemic level inflammatory cytokine ( Goldstein 2007 ) . The importance interaction autonomic pain regulation neural anti-inflammatory pathway indicate several finding . Flight-or-fight response activate pain result increase epinephrine norepinephrine , inhibit macrophage activation regulate TNF secretion ( Tracey 2002 ) . Moreover , reduction antiinflammatory cytokine ( IL-4 IL-10 ) ( Uceyler 2006 ) increase pro-inflammatory cytokine ( TNF , IL-1 , IL6 , IL-8 ) show syndrome characterize generalized pain ( Salemi 2003 , Bazzichi 2007 ) . Thus , data indicate modulation systemic chronic inflammation may significant effect pain processing . In recent year increase focus place upon interaction immune system CNS recognition immune - brain pathway activate sickness response . In addition blood-borne signalling , neural pathway via sensory vagus glossopharyngeal nerve identify ( Watkins 2005 ) . Recent animal study reveal peripheral inflammation , nociceptive input well pronounced mental stress activate microglia cell throughout CNS stimulate microglia cell start produce pro-inflammatory substance ( TNF , IL- 1 , IL-6 ) . These substance initiate central inflammatory change increase pain sensitivity ( allodynia , hyperalgesia likely spontaneously ongoing pain ) result ( Milligan 2009 , Beattie 2002 ) . Moreover , intrathecal administration substance potentiate release antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 , proven efficiently analgesic ( Johnston 2004 ) . These data accordance recent result collagen induce arthritis result decrease threshold thermal mechanical stimulus , begin day onset . This accompany increased inflammatory response spinal cord astrocytes , treatment anti-TNF profoundly analgesic also restore inflammatory change astrocyte ( Inglis JJ 2007 ) . These result thus indicate pain regulation may influence peripheral inflammation also reverse potent anti-inflammatory therapy . Altogether , understand relationship peripheral nociceptive input ( due inflame joint ) , autonomic NS activity , endogenous pain modulatory system CNS inflammation symptom patient RA important lead improve strategy treatment pain mechanisms well fatigue . Imaging Pain conceptualise primarily motivational state induce behavioural drive purpose restore homeostasis . The multidimensionality pain perception support study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ass cerebral activation stimulus-evoked pain human subject . These study document activation brain area traditionally associate perception sensory feature ( e.g . somatosensory cortex ) region associate emotional motivational aspect pain ( prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) insular cortex ( IC ) ) . In addition , brain area involve regulation autonomic nervous system endogenous pain modulation also activate . In recent fMRI study patient chronic low back pain ( LBP ) activation somatosensory cortex see brief period spontaneously increase pain intensity . During period ongoing LBP brain region importance emotional cognitive aspect pain ( i.e . prefrontal cortex cingulate ) activate ( Baliki 2006 ) . These finding indicate perception chronic , ongoing pain require limited involvement pure somatosensory area . These result accordance two recent positron emission tomography ( PET ) study joint pain . In patient pain due knee osteoarthritis , increase activity report prefrontal cortex , cingulate insula arthritic pain compare experimental heat pain ( Kulkarni 2007 ) . Accordingly , another PET study , Schweinhardt et al . ( Schweinhardt 2008 ) report strong activation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex response provoke joint pain RA patient compare experimental heat pain . The result interpret increased activation area implicate emotional cognitive processing noxious stimulus , reflect great emotional salience clinical pain compare experimental pain importance cop strategy potentially influence perception chronic pain . In healthy volunteer , activation prefrontal cortex relate degree anxiety experience experimental pain ( Ochsner 2006 ) prefrontal cortex report consistently activate study clinical pain compare study experimental pain ( Apkarian 2005 ) . Little known relation cerebral pain related activity , clinical symptom , degree systemic inflammation various cop strategy . The aim study We hypothesise RA patient generalised increase pain sensitivity ( i.e. , restrict inflamed joint ) increase pain sensitivity mediate increased central nervous system inflammation affect ability recruit endogenous pain modulatory mechanism negative way . Furthermore , hypothesise treatment TNF antagonist , addition reduction peripheral inflammation , also affect central nervous system inflammation improve ability activate endogenous pain modulatory mechanism thus reduce pain symptom ( i.e. , fatigue ) . The study adresses follow question : 1 . Do patient RA exhibit increase sensitivity randomize painful stimulation inflame joint neutral painfree area , resp. , compare healthy control ? 2 . Does cerebral activation pattern assess fMRI differ patient control experimental painful stimulation painful ( inflamed joint ) non-painful ( thumbnail ) area ? 3 . Can disturbances autonomic nervous system activity link pain sensitivity , cerebral processing noxious stimulus and/or degree inflammation RA patient ? 4 . Can subjective perception fatigue relate follow ; pain sensitivity , abnormalities cerebral pain processing , inflammatory parameter autonomic activity ? 5 . How parameter affect treatment TNF antagonist ( adalimumab ) compare placebo ? Patients active RA incomplete response methotrexate ( MTX ) recruit study well healthy clinical subject . RA patient control compare concern pain pressure threshold , pain processing use brain fMRI , activity autonomous nerve system inflammatory marker blood sample well assessment pain , fatigue use standardized assessment . Following inclusion , patient RA randomize active treatment ( A ) placebo control group ( B ) use standardized procedure randomize , double blind , placebo control study . The treatment group receive adalimumab directly follow baseline assessment subsequently eow study . The placebo control group receive placebo injection baseline , two week four week subsequently adalimumab . The overall aim study obtain increased knowledge concern pain processing fatigue RA , condition influence treatment TNF blockade adalimumab .</detailed_description>
