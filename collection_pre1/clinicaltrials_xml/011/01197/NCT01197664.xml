	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study side effect give paricalcitol together fluorouracil radiation therapy treat patient rectal cancer remove surgery . Paricalcitol may help rectal cancer cell become like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . It yet know chemotherapy radiation therapy effective without paricalcitol treat rectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paricalcitol , Fluorouracil , Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Rectal Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity tolerability oral paricalcitol 2 Î¼g/day co-administered oral 5-fluorouracil ( fluorouracil ) -based chemoradiation patient histologically confirm , resectable T3-T4 adenocarcinoma rectal mucosal origin node-positive disease know distant metastasis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study biologic effect oral paricalcitol addition oral 5-fluorouracil chemoradiation Vitamin D receptor staining , MIB-1 , Caspase 3 , P 21 , Bax protein expression patient . II . To identify pattern gene expression tumor sample patient receive chemo radiation without Paricalcitol supplementation use gene microarray technology . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paricalcitol orally ( PO ) daily . Patients also receive standard care chemoradiotherapy fluorouracil PO . ARM II : Patients receive standard care chemoradiotherapy Arm I . In arm , treatment continue surgical resection absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month surgery .</detailed_description>
