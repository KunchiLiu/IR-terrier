	<brief_title>Association Between Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide Asthma Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From many previous study , fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) many benefit non-invasive , easily perform , less time consume , direct association severity inflammation bronchial tree sputum eosinophil , benefit diagnosis monitoring treatment asthmatic patient . In Thailand , field study less extend , especially child population . We hypothesize uncontrolled partly control group may high level fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) control group . It therefore desirable examine association fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) level asthma control among atopic asthmatic Thai child main objective research .</detailed_description>
