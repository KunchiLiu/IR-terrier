	<brief_summary>In study investigator include patient high risk PSA relapse schedule receive curative surgical treatment . This include patient high Gleason score ( 9-10 ) micrometastatic disease ( tumor cell detect specimen obtain bone marrow ) . They schedule regular follow-up PSA measurement . We previously publish patient metastatic prostate cancer may respond DC-vaccination tumor mRNA , decrease PSA . PSA response relate immunological response . Patients receive DC-vaccination may reduce risk PSA relapse increase time PSA relapse . Previous experience different DC-vaccine protocol hospital result minor side-effects ( grade 1-2 fever , rubor , fatigue , local swell pain ) .</brief_summary>
