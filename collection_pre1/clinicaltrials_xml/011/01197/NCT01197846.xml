Depressive subsyndromal symptom associate functional impairment bipolar disorder ( Vojta et al , 2001 ; Altshuler et al , 2002 ; Yatham et al , 2004 ) The addition olanzapine valproate lithium provide superior efficacy valproate lithium plus placebo non completely remit manic mixed bipolar episode , mainly control depressive symptom ( Tohen et al , 2002 ) Quetiapine demonstrate efficacious control depressive symptom Bipolar Disorder ( BOLDER , EMBOLDEN study ) prevention recurrence , maintain patient YMRS MADRS score cut-off point asymptomatic subsyndromal state ( Studies 126 , 127 144 ) Thus 's expectable add quetiapine previous mood stabilizer bipolar patient subsyndromal symptom probably would improve symptom , mainly depressive , level syndromic symptomatic remission , drive well functional status Quetiapine extend release would use advantage quetiapine immediate release regard easier comfortable posology potential good adherence</detailed_description>
