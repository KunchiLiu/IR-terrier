	<detailed_description>Background : Manual wheelchair propulsion primary source mobility many individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Propelling manual wheelchair extend period often lead arm pain , subsequently , secondary disability . Over 50 % manual wheelchair user SCI experience arm pain limit activity daily live . The prevalence shoulder pain carpal tunnel syndrome among manual wheelchair user 31 % 73 % , 49 % 73 % respectively . A circuit training protocol develop strengthen protect muscle people SCI , show improve muscle strength endurance , reduce HDLcholesterol level . Purpose : The purpose study use ultrasound analyze effect bout circuit training upper extremity person SCI able-bodied control . Hypotheses : All subject show increase nerve cross-sectional area participation circuit training protocol . Nerves tendon become less echogenic participation circuit training protocol . These change pronounce person SCI . Methods : Data collect include history pain , physical exam , ultrasound image nondominant upper extremity bout circuit training , include exercise lift weight use arm cycle . Before circuit training , ultrasound image collect . After circuit training , ultrasound image collect every 10 minute hour . These image use measure health property ( size ) nerve , muscle , tendon arm . Changes property bout circuit training related history physical exam information .</detailed_description>
