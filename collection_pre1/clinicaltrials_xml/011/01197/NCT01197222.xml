The goal study focus one particular type interruption unique laparoscopic surgery - lens cleaning . It quite common course procedure laparoscopic scope lens become obscured bodily fluid steam cautery device . This necessitate remove camera patient , clean outside body , apply de-fog solution , reinserting body , reacquire original camera position image . This quite dangerous particularly middle operative step , ongoing bleeding , sharp hot instrument within body . Pilot data group demonstrate camera may clean 20 time case add upwards 10-15 minute operation .</detailed_description>
