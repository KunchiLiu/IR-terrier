	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerate dose anastrozole alone combination either everolimus ( Afinitor ) , sorafenib ( Nexavar ) , erlotinib ( Tarceva ) , fulvestrant ( Faslodex ) , bevacizumab ( Avastin ) give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hormone Receptor Positive Disease Across Solid Tumor Types : A Phase I Study Single-Agent Hormone Blockade Combination Approaches With Targeted Agents Provide Synergy Overcome Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Anastrozole design block last step estrogen ( hormone ) production . In estrogen-dependent tumor , anastrozole may block tumor growth . Sorafenib design block function cancer protein well tumor blood-vessel forming protein . It may stop growth blood vessel tumor . Bevacizumab design block slow growth cancer cell block growth blood vessel supply nutrient tumor growth . Everolimus design block cancer protein may block tumor growth . Erlotinib design block activity protein find surface many tumor cell may control tumor growth survival . This may stop tumor grow . Fulvestrant design block estrogen action . In estrogen-dependent tumor , fulvestrant may block tumor growth . Study Drug Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group . The study staff tell group . Anastrozole Alone : If receive earlier hormonal treatment , may receive anastrozole alone . Anastrozole Combination Groups : If benefit hormonal treatment past , may receive anastrozole combine either bevacizumab , everolimus , sorafenib , erlotinib . If receive treatment combination drug , assign dose level base join study . Every group receive dose level anastrozole . The first group participant receive low dose level second study drug ( bevacizumab , everolimus , sorafenib , erlotinib ) . Each new group receive high dose second study drug group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose drug combination find . Once high tolerate dose drug combination find , 10 extra participant enrol dose level combination . This called expansion group . In addition expansion , particular tumor type respond study drug ( ) , 14 participant tumor type enrol high safe dose level find . If tumor start grow initial response combination 2 drug , third drug may add combination take . Depending current treatment one follow drug may add : bevacizumab , everolimus , sorafenib , fulvestrant , erlotinib . Study Drug Administration : If take anastrozole alone combination sorafenib erlotinib everolimus , study `` cycle '' 28 day . If take anastrozole combination bevacizumab , study `` cycle '' 21 day . You take anastrozole mouth 1 time every day . You take without food . If assign take sorafenib , take mouth 1 2 time every day . Your doctor tell often take sorafenib . You take sorafenib empty stomach either 1 hour meal 2 hour meal . If assign take bevacizumab , receive vein Day 1 every cycle . During Day 1 Cycle 1 , receive 90 minute . The infusion time may lower tolerate drug well . If assign take everolimus , take mouth 1 time every day food . If assign take erlotinib , take mouth 1 time every day . You take erlotinib empty stomach either 1 hour eat 2 hour eat . If assign receive fulvestrant , receive injection one time every month . Depending study drug combination , may receive 2 injection first month . For first Cycle assign combination receive medication MD Anderson . After first cycle may receive medication home physician study doctor feel safe . Study Visits : At every visit , ask side effect . If take anastrozole combination 28 day cycle , follow test procedure : During Weeks 1 3 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - If study doctor feel safe , may follow-up visit home physician . Every 3 cycle , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think scan need , perform often . If take anastrozole combination 21 day cycle , follow test procedure : During Week 1 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 1 Cycle 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - If study doctor feel safe , may follow-up visit home physician . Every 3 cycle , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . If study doctor think scan need , perform often . Length Study : You may take study drug ( ) long doctor think best interest . You take study intolerable side effect cancer get bad . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug ( ) , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure may perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or PET/CT check status disease . If serious side effect last End-of-Study visit , follow long doctor think best interest . This investigational study . Anastrozole , bevacizumab , everolimus , erlotinib , sorafenib commercially available . Anastrozole FDA approve treat postmenopausal woman hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer . Bevacizumab FDA approve treat non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , colorectal cancer , breast cancer , glioblastoma . Everolimus FDA approve treat advance renal cell carcinoma . Sorafenib FDA approve treat advance renal cell carcinoma , well hepatocellular carcinoma remove surgery . Erlotinib FDA approve treat NSCLC pancreatic cancer . Fulvestrant approve treat breast cancer postmenopausal woman estrogen receptor positive cancer . The combination drug consider investigational . Up 281 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
