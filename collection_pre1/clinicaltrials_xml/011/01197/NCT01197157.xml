	<brief_title>Study Impact Nitazoxanide Chronic Hepatitis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( CHC ) infect approximately 170 million individual worldwide . Egypt high hepatitis C virus prevalence world ( overall prevalence 12 % among general population , 40 % person 40 year age rural area . Approximately , 90 % hepatitis C patient Egypt infect HCV genotype 4 . The main objective antiviral therapy patient chronic hepatitis C sustain elimination hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . The standard care treatment chronic hepatitis C 24- 48- week course peginterferon plus ribavirin , depend genotype . Overall , approximately , half patient cure SOC . For patient genotype 4 , sustain virologic response ( SVR ) rate 48 week therapy range 50 60 % . Based baseline viral load speed virologic response treatment , individualization treatment duration possible . However , approach sufficient substantially improve sustain virologic response ( SVR ) rate . A significant proportion treat patient thus either fail respond relapse follow initial response substantial number patient unable tolerate treatment . There present alternative therapy patient thus need new drug treatment chronic hepatitis C. Nitazoxanide , first member thiazolidide anti-infective class compound , oral anti-parasitic agent major side effect develop licensed US ( Alinia ; Romark Laboratories , L.C. , Tampa FL , USA ) treatment cryptosporidium parvum Giardia lamblia , recently show unexpected antiviral activity HCV replicon system chronically infected patient . A serendipitous observation drug development reveal patient cryptosporidiosis acquire immunodeficiency syndrome co-infected hepatitis C B virus , reduction serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level therapy . This observation lead study anti-viral activity nitazoxanide active metabolite tizoxanide HCV genotype 1a 1b replicons genotype 2 infectious clone , show potent inhibition HCV replication compound submicromolar concentration . In addition , pretreatment HCV replicon-containing cell nitazoxanide show enhance antiviral effect subsequent treatment nitazoxanide plus interferon . The mechanism action nitazoxanide protozoa anaerobic bacteria show result direct inhibition pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme-dependent electron transfer reaction essential anaerobic energy metabolism . However , antiviral mechanism action nitazoxanide appear different . Recent study mechanism action nitazoxanide HCV show induces double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase ( PKR ) phosphorylation , result increase intracellular concentration phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α , naturally occur antiviral intracellular protein key mediator host cell defenses viral infection , mechanism action trigger cell infect HCV , whereas nitazoxanide effect uninfected cell , provide potential explanation low rate toxicity . It worth mention resistance nitazoxanide unlikely exerts antiviral activity modulate cell signal , interferon-like mechanism , rather target virus directly nitazoxanide induce mutation confer viral resistance , suggest genetic barrier development resistance nitazoxanide high . These clinical laboratory observation prompt study potential effect nitazoxanide patient chronic hepatitis C. Rossingol JF et al , demonstrate treatment nitazoxanide monotherapy dose 500 mg twice daily orally , associate ETR 7 23 ( 30.4 % ) patient chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 , virologic response occur 4 20 week therapy ( three week 4 , three week 8 one week 20 ) continue end treatment virological breakthrough . A low serum HCV RNA ≤ 400,000 IU/ml , significant predictor virological response ( p=0.009 ) . In addition , none patient cirrhosis , poorly control diabetes , one patient HBV coinfection respond treatment . Four 7 patient ETR ( 17.4 % 23 treated patient ) SVR , 24 week end treatment . This preliminary data prompt study efficacy safety Nitazoxanide triple therapy combination peginterferon ribavirin patient chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 aim improve rate sustain virological response ( SVR ) . A recent study Rossignol JF et al , conduct total 97 treatment -naïve patient conduct 2 center Egypt demonstrate , significantly patient receive triple therapy peginterferon alfa-2a , ribavirin nitazoxanide experienced SVR compare standard care ( 79 % vs 50 % ; p=0-023 ) . The SVR rate peginterferon plus nitazoxanide group higher standard care ( 61 % vs 50 % ) although difference statistically significant . The percentage rapid virologic response ( RVR ) , define undetectable HCV RNA week 4 combination therapy , SVR significantly high patient give triple ( Nitazoxanide/ peginterferon/ ribavirin ) therapy compare standard care ( 64 % vs 38 % , P = .048 ; 79 % vs 50 % , P = .023 ; respectively ) . Patients give nitazoxanide plus peginterferon alfa-2a intermediate rate RVR ( 54 % ) . There added side effect associate use nitazoxanide . Mean reduction serum HCV RNA baseline RVR visit -2.86 , -3.74 , -4.5 log10 IU/ml peginterferon plus ribavirin , dual therapy peginterferon plus nitazoxanide , triple therapy peginterferon , ribavirin nitazoxanide group , respectively ( p=0.008 ) . Changes ALT level baseline week 72 patient achieve SVR evaluate , nearly patient normalization ALT level ( 15/16 patient group 1 3 , patient group 2 ) , parallel loss detectable serum HCV RNA . Interestingly , use nitazoxanide dual- triple-treatment arm associate reduced relapse rate ( 3/20 patient 1/23 patient , respectively ) compare standard care arm ( 10/30 patient ) . The rationale nitazoxanide lead-in phase combine therapy peginterferon , without ribavirin , base initial pilot experience show great antiviral efficacy nitazoxanide administer peginterferon rather simultaneously . The required duration nitazoxanide lead-in phase unknown , 12 week select initial conservative estimate optimize potential benefit nitazoxanide pretreatment . A subsequent study show 4-week lead-in phase may satisfactory , study also provide confirmation antiviral efficacy nitazoxanide combine peginterferon . In open-labeled study , 44 treatment-naïve patient chronic hepatitis C treat 4 week nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily follow combination dual therapy peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg weekly plus nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily additional 36 week . Interestingly , SVR rate dual therapy ( 80 % ) , similar SVR rate triple therapy ( 79 % ) see previous study use 12-week lead-in phase . This short lead-in period might adequate . In preliminary experience interferon nonresponders , small number patient chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 fail prior interferon-based therapy re-treated use triple therapy nitazoxanide , peginterferon ribavirin achieve SVR rate 25 % ( 3/12 patient ) compare 8 % ( 1/12 patient ) retreat standard care use peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin . All data show nitazoxanide , novel protein kinase inducer , potential increase SVR rate patient chronic hepatitis C , however , study test hypothesis large number naïve nonresponder patient still require .</detailed_description>
