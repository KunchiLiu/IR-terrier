	<brief_title>Efficacy Study TEPSO® Socks Improving Palmoplantar Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical manifestation palmoplantar psoriasis important impact well quality life . The manifestation disease often exacerbate factor significant physical mechanical stress result repeat prolonged pressure affect area everyday clothing . These problem lead textile industry Lenzi Egisto S.p.A. conduct preliminary analysis find fabric meet specific need psoriatic patient relation everyday clothing . This preliminary study lead creation particular fabric , TEPSO® , feature specific identified need . This material consist essentially PTFE ( commercially know Teflon® ) thus present interesting characteristic make suitable create garment patient psoriasis : - Excellent flow property low surface friction - non-stick - Complete biocompatibility chemical inertness We therefore speculate palmoplantar psoriasis high smoothness fabric low coefficient friction may translate less discomfort felt patient normal physical activity , improve clinical course disease . In end , expect reduced mechanical compression friction , would result partial complete clinical remission within week use . Therefore propose conduct randomize control , double-blind , left-right clinical trial ass hypothesis palmoplantar psoriasis use TEPSO® could induce improvement disease overall quality life . To good assess effect treatment , use clothing study limit symmetrical psoriatic lesion feets order include area comparable relevant functional point view .</detailed_description>
