	<brief_title>Evaluation Low Dose Corticosteroids Efficiency , Associated With Myfortic Â® Treatment Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment minimal change nephrotic syndrome ( MCNS ) empirically base high dose steroid . However , side effect adult patient often significant induce lot complication . This prospective study aim compare low dose steroid combine mycophenolic acid ( MyforticR ) versus high dose steroid treatment first episode MCNS . Patients method : two hundred patient include study . They randomly assign double blind treatment Treatment Plan After baseline evaluation include clinical biological histological analysis , eligible patient double-blind assigned two group : Group A : patient receive prednisone 1 mg/kg/day 4 week . Then , dose progressively tapered remission achieve . For patient exhibit incomplete remission time , high dose steroid continue 4 week taper . Group B : patient receive prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day combine mycophenolic acid ( MyforticR ) 1440 mg/day . The management steroid therapy identical group , MyforticR continue six month . In group , patient achieve remission 8 week steroid therapy full dose exclude study . Statistical Analysis In multicenter , randomize trial , primary secondary end point rate complete remission within 4 8 week start induction therapy , respectively .</detailed_description>
