	<brief_summary>Establishing new biochemical marker differential diagnostics risk stratification heterogeneous patient collective become important . The marker objective , reliable , reproducible , quick cost effective well specific sensitive . Concerning differential diagnostics `` dyspnea '' , NT-pro-BNP play important role evaluation cardiac origin . However , correspond biochemical marker pulmonary stress lacking . The aim study hand therefore evaluation surfactant protein B differential diagnostics pulmonary cardiac disease .</brief_summary>
