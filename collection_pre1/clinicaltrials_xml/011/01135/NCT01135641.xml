	<criteria>Adult patient ( ≥18 year ) receive first allogeneic stem cell transplantation hematological disease Confirmed diagnosis first episode chronic GVHD require systemic immunosuppressive therapy . Chronic GVHD diagnosis define accord NIH Working Group Consensus . Chronic GVHD diagnosis base evaluation severity different clinical manifestation include : 1 . Ocular , oral mucosal symptom , 2 . Performance status evaluation , 3 . Pulmonary function evaluation , 4 . Cutaneous evaluation measure percentage extension manifestation lichenoid sclerodermatous aspect , eventually confirm biopsy whenever possible , 5 . Evaluation musculoskeletal manifestation , especially amplitude relevant articulation , 6 . Evaluation liver involvement ( Total bilirubin , Transaminases , Phosphatase alcalines Gamma GT ) . Any source hematopoietic stem cell authorize . Any category conditioning regimen prior alloSCT authorize . Any type stem cell donor authorize . Signed informed consent . Any prior GVHD prophylaxis previously use accept . Absence contraindication use Rituximab . Subjects affiliated appropriate social security system . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test agree use medically acceptable method contraception throughout study 3 month follow end study . Patient develop acute GVHD ( whether early `` late onset '' form ) A `` limited '' form chronic GVHD require systemic immunosuppressive therapy Treatment prednisone ( equivalent ) dose high 1 mg/kg/day time enrollment . GVHD occur follow donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) Not first episode chronic GVHD need systemic immunosuppressive therapy Neutropenia &lt; 500/µL Second allogeneic stem cell transplant Uncontrolled systemic infection opinion investigator associate increase risk patient 's death within 1 month start therapy Severe neurological psychiatric disorder Denied informed consent Pregnancy</criteria>
