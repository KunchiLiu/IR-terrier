	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , generally consider motor disorder , know accompany many instance variety cognitive defect . This explain consider PD neurodegenerative progressive disorder basal ganglion system , work modulate motor , also cognitive emotional behaviour . Concerning , study suggest non-demented PD patient may suffer voluntary selective visual attention orient deficit , show reduce skill focus upon one target , may easily distract irrelevant salient stimulus , consequent negative impact physical health , social interaction quality life . Up , evidence role basal-ganglia system modulate visual attention function poor indirect effect dopaminergic subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) stimulation ( two usual effective treatment PD ) attention performances controversial . The main objective project : 1 ) ass visual selective attention well distractibility PD patient ; 2 ) study effect patient 's usual antiparkinsonian treatment , dopaminergic STN stimulation , visual attention performance . Secondly , clinical neurophysiologic point view , investigator want study respective role dopaminergic pathway sensorimotor associative/limbic cortico-basal ganglion loop pass across STN visual attention performance . To precisely answer objective protocol , investigator record performances participant administration 3 computerized test , suitable study visual attention , decision make motor performance . The investigator compare performance computerized test two group PD patient , one evaluate different set electrical ( without stimulation , selective stimulation sensorimotor associative/limbic part STN ) stimulation , different condition medication ( without dopaminergic treatment ) group healthy subject .</brief_summary>
