	<brief_title>Assessment Sympathetic Nervous System Blockade Upper Limb After Brachial Plexus Block Patients With End Stage Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim To quantify degree sympathetic blockade upper limb patient end stage renal failure produce regional anaesthetic technique , use laser Doppler flowmetry . Hypothesis Regional anaesthesia upper limb result blockade motor sensory nerve , provide surgical post-operative analgesia . Sympathetic nerve also block result local vasodilatation . This may benefit surgery enhance blood flow beneficial arterio-venous fistula creation . The degree duration sympathetic blockade produce regional block however , never quantify . This study aim quantify sympathetic blockade measuring change skin blood flow skin temperature placement brachial plexus block .</detailed_description>
