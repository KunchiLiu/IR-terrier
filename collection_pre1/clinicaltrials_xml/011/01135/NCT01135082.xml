	<brief_title>Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine ( PCV ) HIV- Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>S. pneumoniae important cause severe invasive bacterial disease human immunodeficiency disease ( HIV ) infect child . The incidence pneumococcal bacteremia case require hospitalization among Thai child age &lt; 5 year range 10.6-28.9 case per 100,000 person . [ 1 ] Children infect HIV markedly increase risk pneumococcal infection compare HIV-infected . HIV-infected child rate invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) 2.8 12.6 time rate among HIV-negative child age &lt; 5 &lt; 3 year , respectively . Incidence IPD 6.1 cases/100 patient-years among HIV-infected child age 7 year [ 2 ] Recent important strategy prevention invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) implementation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) , induce immunity start 2 month age . In small study 5-valent PCV among child &lt; 2 year age , serotype-specific IgG antibody ( ELISA ) response 3 dos find immunogenic among group . [ 3 ] The Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 292 show immunologic responses 7- valent PCV similar serotypes among asymptomatic symptomatic HIV - infected child . [ 4 ] The study quantitative qualitative antibody responses 9 - valent PCV HIV-infected child South Africa show similar quantitative antibody response poorer qualitative antibody responses pneumococcal conjugate vaccine compare HIV-negative children. [ 5 ] . In Thailand , 7 - valent PCV ( PrevnarÂ® ) available 2003 . It recommend young child highly recommend high risk child HIV-infected child , congenital heart disease premature infant . However , one major obstacle large scale implementation cost issue . There previous study immunogenicity , safety efficacy 7 - valent PCV HIV -infected Thai child , objective study ass safety immunogenicity 7 - valent PCV vaccine among HIV - infect compare HIV - expose child .</detailed_description>
