	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety CEP-33457 Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 2-week screening period ( visit 1 ) , 20-week treatment period begin baseline visit randomization complete study drug treatment begin ( visit 2 7 ) , final assessment perform 4 week last dose study drug ( visit 8 [ week 24 early termination ] ) . Patients randomize receive either CEP-33457 placebo subcutaneously every 4 week . Plasma sample measurement study drug concentration collect subset patient study drug administer study visit final visit . The dose background steroid medication may increase , need , treat patient minor fluctuation lupus disease activity . One interim analysis conduct least 80 patient complete week 12 withdrawn study . Patients complete treatment period return study center 4 week last dose administer final procedure assessment . Final procedure assessments patient withdraw study 20 week treatment perform last visit . Final procedure assessments patient participate study beyond week 24 perform next regularly schedule visit . Patients complete study eligible participation 12-month open-label study ( study C33457/3075 ; herein refer study 3075 ) ass continue effectiveness safety CEP-33457 treatment .</detailed_description>
