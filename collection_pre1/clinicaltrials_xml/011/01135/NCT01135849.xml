	<brief_summary>We hope determine importance different gene ( include B receptor ) anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy . This important benefit patient expose anthracyclines , could help determine whether certain individual increase susceptibility cardiac injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>B-Receptor Signaling Cardiomyopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong correlation total doxorubicin dose anti-tumor efficacy , however , clinical utility doxorubicin severely limited cardiotoxicity . With improved method detect subtle change cardiac function , e.g . alteration leave ventricular wall stress ( 1 ) , incidence doxorubicin cardiotoxicity appreciate much high previously suspect , document 65 % long-term survivor childhood cancer , even dose low 228 mg/m2 . This cardiotoxicity dose-related , high dos relate high incidence clinical heart failure ( 2 ) . Doxorubicin 's cardiotoxicity think mediate generation free radical mitochondrial membrane damage . We wish determine whether beta-receptor genotype affect anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy . We correlate beta-receptor genotype difference wall stress post-anthracycline exposure , difference shorten fraction . We plan recruit 300 patient two-year period . Inclusion criterion include past exposure anthracycline cancer treatment echocardiogram 6 - 48 month exposure anthracyclines . The mean difference 1 . ) wall stress 2 . ) shorten fraction minor allele subgroup wild type subgroup , beta-1 beta-2 assess use unpaired t-test analysis . We assess multivariate linear regression whether interaction difference wall stress fractional shortening variable age , gender , dose anthracycline , type anthracycline give , time anthracycline exposure echocardiogram . Those receive cardiotoxic drug ( trastuzumab breast cancer ) analyze separately .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . ) Past exposure anthracycline chemotherapy cancer 2 . ) Echocardiogram least six month exposure anthracyclines ( patient age 40 , echocardiogram must obtain within 6 48 month anthracycline exposure ) 3 . ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . We age , gender , ethnic background limitation . Due increase frequency cardiovascular disease cause adults 40 year , limit enrollment patient echocardiogram 6 48 month completion anthracycline exposure . Children include eligible echocardiogram least 6 month completion anthracycline treatment.. 1 . ) Congenital heart disease ( patent foramen ovale ) 2 . ) Preexisting cardiomyopathy anthracycline administration 3 . ) Patients Down syndrome 4 . ) Patients receive Bblocker therapy time anthracycline exposure 5 . ) Pregnant patient ( echocardiogram obtain either pregnancy within three month pregnancy ) All participant cancer survivor . To minimize bias postpartum cardiomyopathy , pregnant patient exclude echocardiogram obtain pregnancy within three month pregnancy . HIVpositive person exclude study . Of note , patient receive MUGA ( multigated acquisition ) study evaluate leave ventricular ejection fraction . Patients receive MUGA scan NOT include study echocardiogram necessary</criteria>
