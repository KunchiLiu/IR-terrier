	<brief_summary>This study design demonstrate accuracy OptiScanner glucose measurement . The accuracy test device determine use plasma sample collect directly Type 1 Type 2 Diabetics use OptiScanner . Blood sample simultaneously collect measure YSI 2300 STAT PLUS ( YSI ) make YSI Incorporated . These result compare OptiScanner 's glucose measurement .</brief_summary>
