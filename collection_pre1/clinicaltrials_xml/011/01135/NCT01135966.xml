	<brief_summary>Pulmonary rehabilitation emerge recommended standard care patient chronic lung disease base grow body scientific evidence . A set evidence-based guideline publish American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) American Association Cardiovascular Pulmonary Rehabilitation ( AACVPR ) . Since , publish literature pulmonary rehabilitation increase substantially , society publish important statement pulmonary rehabilitation ( eg , American Thoracic Society European Respiratory Society ) . In patient COPD , strong scientific basis implement conventional resistance training ( CRT ) addition endurance training . Endurance training , walking , key component pulmonary rehabilitation improve exercise tolerance muscular endurance . However , type training may reverse muscle weakness atrophy . For reason , strength training seem optimum training modality increase muscle mass strength . Recently , Whole-Body-Vibration ( WBV ) training promote alternative resistance training multigym equipment . In WBV training , subject stand platform generates vertical sinusoidal vibration , static dynamic exercise perform . The present study conduct provide answer follow question : resistance training program , whole body vibration , even effective conventional resistance training program patient COPD .</brief_summary>
