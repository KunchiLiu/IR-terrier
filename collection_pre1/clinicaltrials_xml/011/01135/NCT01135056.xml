	<brief_title>Study Compare Selective Internal Radiation Therapy ( SIRT ) Versus Sorafenib Locally Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 5th common cancer worldwide unfortunately 70 - 80 % HCC Asia-Pacific prevalence chronic viral hepatitis region . The increase prevalence chronic hepatitis C Western world however predict HCC similarly important cause death next 20 year . Only 15-20 % HCC today potentially curable surgery time diagnosis . Another 10-15 % patient may benefit potentially curative locally ablative therapy radio-frequency ablation . Prognosis majority patient dismal conventional systemic therapy largely inefficacious . The first successfully trialed systemic targeted therapy , sorafenib ( 2007 ) prolong survival modest average 3 month patient good underlying liver function . While liver radio-sensitive , external beam radiation cause significant radio-toxicity . To overcome , selective internal radiation therapy ( SIRT ) develop deliver radiation source directly liver cancer via arterial route . Sir-sphere radioactive yttrium 90 micro-meter diameter resin carrier establish therapy colorectal metastasis . Sir-sphere report cause significantly tumour regression HCC . This study evaluate efficacy SIRT use SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres compare sorafenib treatment patient locally advance primary HCC .</detailed_description>

Any concurrent malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree least 5 year . Presence clinical sign CNS metastasis due poor prognosis progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( except viral hepatitis ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any following contraindication angiography selective visceral catheterization : Bleeding diathesis , correctable standard form therapy .
