	<brief_summary>Hypnotic trance mindfulness meditation show benefit physical health . The current study seek determine distinct pattern brain activity correlate hypnotic trance , mindfulness meditation , relate pattern measurable marker physical well-being . Precise neuroimaging heighten attentional state guide future researcher practitioner toward effective technique mind/body control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Hypnosis Mindfulness Meditation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our goal determine functional brain network define distinguish two induced state sustain attention -- hypnosis mindfulness -- may substantial relevance medicine . Defining neural underpinnings state would broad implication understand cognitive state emerge functional network , affect peripheral autonomic nervous system activity , therapeutic efficacy optimize . We propose functional MRI study use rest state methodology study 20-40 subject four follow group : 1 . Highly hypnotizable subject 2 . Minimally hypnotizable subject 3 . Experienced mindfulness meditators 4 . Novice mindfulness meditators . The ability hypnotize stable measurable trait pre-screened quantified . Dr. Spiegel select subject accord ability hypnotize prior MRI visit ( see ? recruit ? ) . We seek great contrast group enrol high ( 8-10 ) low ( 0-2 ) score Hypnotic Induction Profile . The presence poorly hypnotizable group allow control condition undergone identical induction routine without achieve hypnotic trance . Similarly , novice meditators serve control group experience mindfulness meditation . Prior study show difference brain activation grey matter volume associate longer practice meditation ( &gt; 4 year ) compare novice meditators . As , experience meditators define regular meditation practice four year longer . Novice meditators new practitioner interested mindfulness meditation practice , complete one-hour meditation training week study participation .</detailed_description>
