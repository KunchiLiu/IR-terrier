Using Care Transition conceptual model , investigator propose develop evaluating , randomize control trial , `` e-Coach , '' Interactive-Voice-Response-supported ( IVR ) Care Transition coach intervention , focus initially patient hospitalize heart failure obstructive lung disease . This trial test primary hypothesis proportion patient one re-hospitalizations 90-day post-discharge follow-up period less IVRsupported care transition intervention ( e-Coach ) compare `` usual care '' comparison group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For complex medical patient , transition hospital home-based care vulnerable period , place patient high risk adverse event , include experience medical error loss community tenure . Recent successful study use Care Transition Intervention ( CTI ) , use nurse conduct home visit , telephone follow-up , provide assistance discharge . Although successful , model costly feasible setting serve geographically disperse population . We propose cost-efficient technological solution problem present traditional CTI `` e-Coach , '' Interactive-Voice-Response-supported ( IVR ) Care Transition coach intervention . We propose develop evaluate `` e-Coach , '' perform randomize control trial intervention versus usual care comparison group . Our Specific Aims : 1 ) Randomize 720 patient high risk transition-related error ( complex adult patient discharge alive hospitalization congestive heart failure ( CHF ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , geographically diverse area include many rural area across Alabama South ) IVR-supported care transition program ( `` e-Coach '' ) versus usual care comparison group . The IVR system actively call patient multiple interval discharge . In stepped-care approach , IVR support Care Transition nurse monitor patient symptom e-Coach IVR support patient self management telephone-based interaction need , 3 month discharge ; 2 ) Evaluate use e-Coach patient healthcare provider ; 3 ) Evaluate impact e-Coach patient outcome , include 90 day rehospitalizations , successful community tenure 3 month period , medication discrepancy , patient self-efficacy base previously validate Care Transition Measure ; 4 ) Quantify cost associate e-Coach .</detailed_description>
