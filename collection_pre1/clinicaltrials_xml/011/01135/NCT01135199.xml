	<brief_title>Pomalidomide Cough Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic cough one debilitating symptom patient IPF . It estimate 80 % patient IPF experience clinically significant cough . The impact chronic cough QOL include fatigue , embarrassment , anxiety , sleep disturbance , hoarseness , incontinence , dizziness , vomit , rib fracture , severe dyspnea . There also evidence chronic cough may contribute increase airway inflammation . In IPF patient , significant oxygen desaturation often accompany cough episode lead increased dyspnea , anxiety , panic . Studies examine alternative therapeutic agent cough IPF patient scarce . Cough patient IPF typically refractory traditional antitussive agent corticosteroid . Unfortunately , side effect corticosteroid combine lack efficacy prevention disease progression IPF make less desired treatment option . Although opiate effective controlling cough , issue sedation , respiratory depression narcotic dependence significant . This open label , safety efficacy pilot study pomalidomide 20 patient IPF . This study determine tolerability feasibility pomalidomide treatment cough patient population . Eligible patient select Interstitial Lung Disease Clinic database consist patient ILD see clinic since 2004 sign inform consent ( previously approve Administrative Panel Human Subjects Medical Research , protocol 14054 ) . Those patient IPF describe severity cough decreasing , adversely affect , quality life invite participate study . SCREENING VISIT During visit , study fully review patient , already receive consent form discuss phone , previous clinic visit study coordinator possibly PI Sub PI . At visit pt . undergo Informed Consent , bloodwork include Chem Panel LFTs , CBC , History Physical Exam - MD , Vital Signs , Spirometry without Bronchodilator , Diffusion Capacity , 6 Minute Walk , EKG , Adverse Events , Cough Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Leicester Cough Questionaire ( LCQ ) , Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire ( CQLQ ) , St. George Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) , dispensation Cough Symptom Diary ( CSD ) . If patient continue meet eligibility criterion , current cough suppressive agent discontinue day 1-14 . STUDY DAY 1 , VISIT 1 History Physical Exam - MD , Vital Signs , Adverse Events , Cough Visual Analog Scale , LCQ , CQLQ SGRQ . The patient give 30 day supply 2mg capsule pomalidomide write instruction dose instruction call study center adverse reaction . WEEK 1 , Visit 2 Pt . come study site safety lab , assessment adverse event change medication . WEEK 2 , VISIT 3 The patient return clinic assess potential adverse reaction safety laboratory work do . WEEKS 4 , 8 , 12 ( Visits 4 , 6 , 8 ) The participant return study center undergo physical exam , vital sign , assessment adverse event , self-completion VAS , LCQ , CQLQ . Every two week ( Visits 2 , 4 , 6 ) patient also undergo safety laboratory test either do Stanford local lab . As part routine care , obtain spirometry 6MWT start end study . If abnormality patient 's labs week 2 either withdraw patient study down-titrate dose depend severity lab abnormality . A 30 day supply 2mg capsule pomalidomide dispense Week 4 8 . The patient undergo 2 week taper 1 mg/day study drug week 12 drug wk . 14 , return follow visit week 18 assessment adverse event , history physical exam , lab work include pregnancy test , completion four questionnaire . Patients respond meeting establish minimally clinically important difference CQLQ well demonstrate safety tolerance laboratory test physician exam wish remain study may additional 9 month discretion Protocol Director . These participant undergo taper week 12 re-supplied monthly basis week 48 time taper drug 2 week . The Visit Schedule extension study initial 3 month exception safety laboratory blood work do monthly instead every two week .</detailed_description>
