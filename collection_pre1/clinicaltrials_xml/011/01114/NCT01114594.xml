	<brief_title>Pilot Study RNA Biomarker Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proteins small molecule urine ( biomarkers ) use probe kidney systemic disease hundred year . Urine reportedly contain type molecule call microRNA ( miRNAs ) regulate large number biological process . Impaired function miRNAs recognize increase number disease process . In search new biomarkers , regulatory function miRNAs relative simplicity precision characterize miRNAs , potential advantage compare traditional biomarkers . The aim pilot project ass potential urine miRNAs biomarkers characterize patient autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) , prevalent inherit cause kidney failure . Individuals cause chronic kidney disease ( e.g. , diabetes , glomerulonephritis ) , match key characteristic ( e.g . age , sex , level kidney function ) serve control population . A technique isolation miRNAs urine sample tailor specific need project . Biochemical computational analysis small RNAs sample provide urine miRNA profile key variability statistic use design follow-up project involve patient kidney disease .</detailed_description>
