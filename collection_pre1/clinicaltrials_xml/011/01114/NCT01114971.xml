	<brief_title>Labetalol Esmolol : Vital Signs Post Operative Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Finding optimal combination anesthetic adjuvant drug maintain hemodynamic stability surgery challenge ( 1-3 ) . Traditionally , potent opioid analgesic like fentanyl newer analog use purpose . However , use opioid compound associate well-known side effect ( e.g. , ventilatory depression , postoperative nausea vomiting , constipation , ileus , bladder dysfunction , urinary retention , pruritus , drowsiness sedation ) . All common side effect interfere early recovery process contribute delay resumption normal activity ( 4 , 5 ) . Increasingly , non-opioid analgesic ( e.g . β-blockers local anesthetic ) utilized adjuvant drug surgery treatment acute hyperdynamic response ( increase catecholamine release ) surgery , well , facilitation recovery process surgery anesthetic analgesic-sparing effect . The β-blocking drug , esmolol labetalol use alternative short-acting opioid analgesic control transient , acute autonomic response surgery ( 5-8 ) , They show reduce anesthetic requirement intravenous ( propofol ) volatile-based anesthesia ( 6,7,10-13 ) decrease opioid consumption intraoperatively PACU ( 8 ) . They may also improve hemodynamic stability induction emergence anesthesia perioperative early postoperative period facilitate resumption normal activity major surgical procedure . The anesthetic analgesic-sparing effect β -blockers also lead fast emergence anesthesia reduce postoperative opioid side effect ( e.g. , PONV ) ( 14-18 ) . Perioperative intravenous esmolol show improvement perioperative outcome , decrease acute hemodynamic response , reduces anesthetic opioids use anesthesia , facilitate fast emergence anesthesia , reduces intraoperative postoperative opioid requirement , reduces side effect pruritus , constipation , ileus , nausea vomiting ( PONV ) thereby shorten hospital stay . ( 3 , 7 , 13 , 18 ) Local anesthetic like lidocaine posse analgesic , antihyperalgesic anti-inflammatory property . Perioperative intravenous lidocaine show improvement perioperative outcome patient undergo abdominal surgery decrease intraoperative requirement Inhalants/Intravenous agent , opioid consumption , postoperative pain , fatigue , nausea vomiting score , maintain hemodynamic stability , facilitate rapid recovery gastrointestinal function , improve postoperative recovery , fast resumption normal activity daily live shorten length hospital stay , administer adjuvant surgery . ( 19,23-29,33 ) Theoretically , would extremely beneficial administer adjuvant ( patient undergo abdominal surgery ) capable effectively control autonomic response surgery , provide faster recovery few side effect . Preliminary data suggest perioperative effect systemic administration lidocaine esmolol effective facilitating bowel recovery , decrease opioid consumption intra/postoperative period , shorten length hospital stay early recovery . Therefore , design prospective , randomize , double-blinded , active-controlled study test hypothesis systemic administration lidocaine esmolol combination ( vs. either drug alone ) maintenance hemodynamic stability surgery result improve postoperative outcome patient undergo abdominal surgery ( e.g. , less pain postoperative nausea vomiting , fast return bowel function resumption normal activity daily live ) ; lead shorten length hospital stay .</detailed_description>
