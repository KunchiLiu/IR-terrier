	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate safety tolerability otelixizumab patient Graves ' ophthalmopathy ( thyroid eye disease ) . There currently alternative therapy available condition treatment steroid , radiotherapy surgery . The study also include comparison current steroid treatment , methylprednisolone , propose new otelixizumab treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Otelixizumab Thyroid Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study otelixizumab , monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) direct human lymphocyte antigen CD3 ( protein find certain type white blood cell ) . This open-label , comparator-controlled , two part study evaluate safety tolerability otelixizumab patient Graves ' ophthalmopathy ( GO ) . It also look see otelixizumab affect GO work compare methylprednisolone ( standard treatment active GO ) . In Part A , one four group 5 patient receive dos otelixizumab administer 8 day . The first dose level provide low cumulative dose , low dose level safely administer previous study . Safety clinical response data review 8 week , clinical response see safety concern , dose otelixizumab increase new group subject enter Part A . In subsequent group cumulative medium low , medium high , high dos otelixizumab may investigate . However clinical response see low dose study move directly Part B . In Part B , patient receive either otelixizumab dose set Part A , 8 day ( 5 patient ) methylprednisolone weekly 12 week ( 5 patient ) . All dose intravenous infusion . All participant undergo long term safety evaluation 48 month . Key assessment include vital sign , 12-lead ECG , liver function test , thyroid function , viral monitoring , monitor cortisol ACTH level , laboratory safety test adverse event ( side effect ) data . Assessment GO severity evaluate use recommended assessment include clinical activity assessment quality life questionnaire . Measurements exploratory biomarkers ( protein find naturally blood ) also include study .</detailed_description>
