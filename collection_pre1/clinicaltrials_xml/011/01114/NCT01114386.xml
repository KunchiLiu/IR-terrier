	<detailed_description>We recruit 100 patient old 50 year diagnosis COPD and/or CHF . COPD define presence fix airflow obstruction ( post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC le 70 % ) accord Global Initiative Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline . Each patient characterize medical history physical examination . Patients diagnosis COPD must : 1 ) history chronic respiratory symptom , i.e. , cough sputum and/or breathlessness occasional wheezing ( SGRQ MMRC Questionnaire ) ; 2 ) smoker ex-smokers 10 pack-years , 3 ) document absence history variable airflow obstruction and/or diagnosis asthma . Each patient perform pulmonary function test , include reversibility inhale bronchodilator ( 400 Âµg albuterol ) ; arterial blood gas , routine blood test . In addition , patient undergo regular PA/LL chest x-ray . The diagnosis CHF establish accord criterion European Society Cardiology . At time entry study , patient clinically stable condition ( ie , change medication dosage frequency , exacerbation disease hospital admission precede 6 week ) . Clinical biological follow-up patient prospectively follow 2 year , 2009 2011 .</detailed_description>
