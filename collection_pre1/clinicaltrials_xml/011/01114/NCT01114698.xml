	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study JNJ26489112 Patients With Treatment-Resistant Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign treatment group chance ) , double-blind ( neither study physician patient know identification treatment assign ) , active- placebo-controlled study ass efficacy safety JNJ26489112 adult patient treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . The active control use study venlafaxine extended-release [ XR ] , antidepressant drug use treat patient MDD . A target 150 patient randomly assign ( like flip coin ) 1 3 treatment group approximately 50 patient plan per treatment group . This study consist screen phase 4 week , 6-week double-blind treatment phase , safety follow-up period include 1-week taper phase ( describe ) . During screen phase , patient meet entry criterion study taper current psychotropic medication ( medication affect mind mood mental process ) prior randomization double-blind treatment phase study . In double-blind treatment phase , patient randomly assign receive either 2 capsule JNJ26489112 , venlafaxine XR ( active comparator ) , placebo ( sugar pill ) daily 6 week . Upon completion double-blind treatment phase patient discontinue study drug time point double-blind treatment phase , study medication taper and/or discontinue blinded manner 1-week period . A Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) make individual involve conduct study monitor safety study . The primary outcome measure change baseline end point ( 6 week treatment time early withdrawal study ) total score Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS , scale physician use measure severity depression patient change depression due antidepressant treatment ) . Patient safety monitor study evaluate adverse event ( side effect ) report findings clinical laboratory test result , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement , body weight measurement physical , neurologic , ophthalmologic examination perform . Blood sample assess pre- post dose level JNJ26489112 venlafaxine obtain protocol-specified time point study . In addition , blood sample obtain enrolled patient Visit 2 pharmacogenomics research ( research help identify genetic marker response , explain variability data , address emerge clinical issue ) . Patients receive double-blind treatment 2 capsule JNJ26489112 ( 500 mg/day first 3 week may increase 1000 mg/day week 4 ) , venlafaxine XR ( 75 mg/day week 1 increase 150 mg/day week 2-6 ] ) , placebo orally ( mouth ) food daily 6 week . After 6 week , venlafaxine XR 150 mg/day taper one 75 mg/day capsule 1 week patient receive JNJ26489112 placebo switch 1 capsule placebo 1 week .</detailed_description>
