	<criteria>ALL Patients : 1 . Patient must lymphoma , squamous cell carcinoma head neck , HER2+ breast adenocarcinoma , colorectal adenocarcinoma , solid tumor . 2 . Patients must receive immunosuppressive anti cancer agent within 2 week prior first plan FNA biopsy . 3 . The patient 's therapeutic plan must include standard therapeutic monoclonal antibody ( rituximab , cetuximab/panitumumab trastuzumab ) investigational monoclonal antibody ) administer schedule FNA biopsy do within one week prior , and/or peripheral blood drawn immediately prior first dose therapeutic mAb immediately 24336 hour post dose . Patients receive anti cancer immunosuppressive ( steroid ) modality within time frame preferred , though use agent exclude study . 4 . Patients receive immunosuppressive anticancer agent within 2 week prior first plan FNA biopsy prefer . 5 . Informed consent must occur documented per institutional rule prior first plan FNA biopsy blood draw . Patients Providing FNA addition Blood Samples : Criteria applicable FNA , require patient provide PBMCs without FNA . Patients without tumor amenable FNA candidate blood sample . If patient meet inclusion criterion , exclude participate study . 1 . Patients must normal WBC platelet count , must evidence coagulopathy must receive irreversible platelet inhibitor ( aspirin ) 2 week reversible platelet inhibitor ( NSAIDS ) one week prior initial FNA biopsy . 2 . Patients may take therapeutic anticoagulation ( target INR &gt; =2 ) ( warfarin heparin ) . 3 . Patients must tumor mass amenable minimally invasive fine needle aspiration direct visualization and/ palpation tumor . Generally biopsy primary tumor site superficial regional lymph node .</criteria>
