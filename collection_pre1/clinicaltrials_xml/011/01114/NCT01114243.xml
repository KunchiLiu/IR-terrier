	<brief_summary>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) serious autoimmune childhood disease encompass several type chronic arthritis . It common rheumatic disease child cause significant short-term long-term disability , include permanent joint damage . Management JIA base combination pharmacologic intervention , physical occupational therapy , psychosocial support . Intra-articular steroid ( IAS ) injection , injection steroid medication arthritic joint , routine therapeutic procedure clinical rheumatology . Most pediatric rheumatologist currently perform injection base knowledge anatomy feel anatomical landmark , result adult study ultrasound ( US ) -guided technique suggest role use US treat manage JIA . The overall goal project determine feasibility multicenter study compare US-guided IAS injection usual technique use external anatomic feature improve arthritis symptom JIA . The key issue pilot project determine : 1 ) ability use US successfully image detect abnormalities joint child JIA 2 ) image inject medication joint space surroundings immediately injection 3 ) determine method measure clinical response injection 4 ) evaluate feasibility use save US scan localize injected medication around joint determine abnormality concern arthritis . These result use establish protocol necessary design multicenter study determine effect US-guided IAS injection treatment juvenile arthritis . Studies regard applicability feasibility musculoskeletal US outpatient pediatric rheumatology set important order establish utility new technology guide diagnosis therapy JIA . Results study may significant impact pediatric rheumatology way pediatric rheumatologist currently assess sign arthritis perform routine therapeutic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIM 1 : The first aim two-part cross-sectional study compare US image active joint 55 subject JIA standardize clinical functional measure , assume subject least 1 active joint . Subjects less 21 year diagnose JIA per classification describe International League Against Rheumatism ( ILAR ) large medium joint synovitis eligible . - Phase 1 . A pediatric rheumatologist examine 25 subject spectrum arthritis severity inform consent obtain . Large medium joint , knee , ankle , wrist , elbow , assess active arthritis , define swell limitation motion pain warmth . Grading clinical severity derive ACR Pediatric 30 ass swell scale 0-3 limitation motion warmth pain motion scale 0-3 . Based grading , Clinical Severity Score inactive , mild , moderate , severe arthritis obtain joint . Following clinical evaluation , pediatric rheumatologist receive training musculoskeletal US ( PI ) image joint . A portable US machine high frequency probe ( 6-18 MHz ) power Doppler capability use image target joint identify anatomical sign suggestive arthritis . At least 2 view , coronal transverse , joint obtain record per musculoskeletal US specification describe European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) . US image save subject code US machine hard drive . These image review consult rheumatologist expertise musculoskeletal US ( J. Nishio , MD ) . US determination synovitis ( synovial thickness Doppler enhancement ) , effusion , erosion , tenosynovitis base definition establish Outcome Measures Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials ( OMERACT ) 7 consensus group adults rheumatologic disease . An US score arthritis develop base gold standard clinical exam . The US score ass active arthritis define synovitis scale 0-3 and/or effusion scale 0-3 . In addition , significant abnormality joint evaluate , include absence presence erosion tenosynovitis . The result phase Aim 1 creation US Severity Score inactive , mild , moderate , severe arthritis single large medium joint consistent Clinical Severity Score . - Phase II . The US Severity Score develop describe test correlation Clinical Severity Score . An additional 30 subject meet inclusion criterion enrol assessed arthritis physical exam perform pediatric rheumatologist follow US exam perform PI . If subject 1 large medium joint arthritis , single joint choose random selection . Based finding , clinician assign clinical score , PI consult rheumatologist assign US score base standardize US Severity Score obtain Phase I . The PI consult rheumatologist mask physical exam finding Clinical Severity Score . The US score compare clinical score ass US score relates standardize clinical measure . AIM 2 : The second aim study use US image placement IAS response therapy 20 subject receive IAS treatment active arthritis large medium joint . Patients le 21 year old diagnosis JIA per ILAR classification receive IAS injection knee , wrist , elbow , ankle part standard medical care eligible . Non-eligible patient include subject non-inflammatory diagnosis , mechanical joint disease , large joint effusion require additional therapeutic procedure , arthrocentesis . Informed consent assent child 7 obtain . The targeted joint score rheumatologist PI use Clinical Severity Score describe . Sedation may provide per routine joint injection . Routine process joint injection follow . The pediatric rheumatologist perform injection use standard external clinical landmark palpation identify appropriate injection site . Triamcinolone hexacetonide 1 % unbuffered lidocaine shake allow introduction air per GAS-graphy technique describe Koski et al . inject target joint . The PI , perform injection study , obtain US image prior immediately follow joint injection . The rheumatologist perform injection mask US image . Each image obtain record use EULAR specification , save subject code US machine hard drive , score PI consult rheumatologist use US Severity Score describe . For second aim , I also determine presence absence steroid within target joint capsule . The physician performing physical exam , subject , subject 's guardian ( ) mask regard US result , include location steroid within around joint space sonographic recording joint pathology . Patient outcomes determine 1 week , 4-6 week 3-6 month Clinical Severity Score US use US Severity Score describe developed Aim 1 . The clinician performing physical exam sonographer mask 's score . Other variable also collect part aim , include pain assess standardized pain scale , physician assessment global disease activity , functional status determine childhood health assessment questionnaire ( CHAQ ) , validate , reliable measure functional status JIA . These last assessment 3 6 measure ACR Pediatric 30 , validate measure use clinical trial JIA ( Giannini et al. , 1997 ) . Other patient data collect include JIA subtype , duration disease , age onset , age procedure , race/ethnicity , concurrent medication , whether procedure require use general anesthesia .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The first aim twopart crosssectional study compare US image active joint 55 subject JIA standardize clinical functional measure , assume subject least 1 active joint . All subject must meet follow criterion Less 21 year old Have diagnosis JIA per ILAR classification Have large and/ medium joint synovitis The second aim study use US image placement IAS response therapy 20 subject receive IAS treatment active arthritis large medium joint . Subjects must meet following criterion : Less 21 year old Have diagnosis JIA per ILAR classification Will receive IAS injection knee , wrist , elbow , and/or ankle part standard medical care Subjects noninflammatory diagnosis , mechanical joint disease Subjects large joint effusion require additional therapeutic procedure , arthrocentesis Subjects 21 year old old Subjects without diagnosis JIA per ILAR classification Subjects without large and/or medium joint synovitis Subjects require IAS injection knee , wrist , elbow , and/or ankle part standard medical care ( Aim 2 subject )</criteria>
