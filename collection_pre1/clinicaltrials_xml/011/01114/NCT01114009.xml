	<brief_title>Effects Recruitment Maneuvers Early Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) first describe medical literature 1967 . Patients ARDS mostly require mechanical ventilatory support due hypoxic respiratory failure . Mechanical ventilation induce lung injury ( ventilator-induced lung injury , VILI ) cause overdistention repetitive opening closing unstable lung unit . Data number randomize controlled trial indicate lung protective ventilatory strategy small tidal volume low plateau pressure reduce mortality acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome . Lung recruitment maneuver use management ALI ARDS , recruitment maneuver still controversial . Lung recruitment maneuver aim open collapse lung keep lung open . The maneuver briefly increase alveolar pressure open recruitable lung , sustain adequate positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) lung recruitment , avoid derecruitment . We want enroll 120 patient early ALI/ARDS randomize control study . The study group use recruitment maneuver lung protective ventilatory strategy , control group use lung protective ventilatory strategy . Concerning safety efficacy , design modify recruitment maneuver protocol never publish previous medical literature . The primary outcome ventilator-free day ICU-free day , secondary outcome include ventilator wean rate , 28-day mortality cost effectiveness analysis . Since randomize control trial clearly establish benefit recruitment maneuver , hope study would able provide evidence whether lung recruitment use routine management ALI/ARDS .</detailed_description>
