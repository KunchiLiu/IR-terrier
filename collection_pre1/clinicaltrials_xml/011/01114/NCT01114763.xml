	<brief_summary>Mechanisms link metabolic syndrome atherosclerosis incompletely understood . As part Hämeenlinna Metabolic Syndrome Research Program ( HMS ) , 40 men metabolic syndrome 40 physically active control ( age : 30 65 year ) compare cross-sectional study . Except routine laboratory parameter , arterial elasticity level oxidize LDL determine . Study hypothesis : Levels oxidize LDL finding arterial elasticity may differ subject metabolic syndrome control explain elevate risk cardiovascular disease among patient metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Accumulation oxidize low-density lipoprotein intimae artery together risk factor know enhance atherosclerosis , damage endothelium arterial wall . Dysfunction endothelium lead loss elasticity artery . Especially reduction elasticity small artery find prominent atherosclerosis believe serve marker early stage atherosclerosis . In study , investigate whether level oxidize LDL arterial elasticity differ patient metabolic syndrome physically active control . Oxidized LDL assess two-site ELISA immunoassay ( Mercodia , Uppsala , Sweden ) . The capacitive elasticity large artery ( C1 ) reflective elasticity small artery ( C2 ) automatically assess CR-2000 mean five similar pulse wave appear measurement . C1 identify elastic property aorta large artery , C2 endothelial function microvascular circulation . Proper statistical method use reveal possible difference significance patient control .</detailed_description>
