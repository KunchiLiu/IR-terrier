These technique - patient positioning , continuous sub-glottic suction secretion , selective decontamination digestive tract etc… - aim prevent inhalation oro-pharyngeal contaminated secretion around cuff tracheal tube use connect patient machine . Their efficacy regularly challenge still unable suppress totally occurrence VAP . The cuff tracheal tube use long-term MV ICU often low pressure high volume polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) cuff order adhere large surface tracheal wall without induce ischemic lesion . Recent advance allow industrial company provide u 1 ) polyurethane cuff 2 ) cuff conic shape , potentially offer good tightness inhalation least VITRO animal model . The effect reduction VAP incidence suggest several pilot series . The aim present project ass efficacy four type cuff ( PVC conic cylinder shape polyurethane conic cylinder shape ) prevent tracheal colonisation .

	<brief_title>Prevention Inhalation Bacterial Using Endotracheal Tube Balloon Polyvinyl Chloride Polyurethane</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Long-term mechanical ventilation ( MV ) risk factor acquisition bacterial pneumonia tracheal tube by-passes natural mechanism airway protection , particularly epiglottis trachea-bronchial mucosa . Acute respiratory failure potential associate organ dysfunction require MV patient sedate sometimes strict horizontal supine position . Sedation conscience alteration permit swallow oro-pharyngeal secretion , horizontal position favor bacterial colonization secretion stagnation posterior part pharynx . These aspect favor iterative inhalation oro-pharyngeal secretion around cuff tracheal tube . The cuff , principal objective permit pressurization low respiratory tract inspiratory phase prevent air leak around tracheal tube , allow certain degree protection tracheal tree micro-inhalations . Using diagnostic criterion Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) base distal protected sample , incidence around 10 per 1,000 MV-days medical-surgical ICUs . These VAP associate attributable mortality around 25 % . A number recommendation establish prevent VAP occurrence . The 45° semi-recumbent position patient 's reduces gastro-esophageal reflux VAP incidence . This result limit fact 45° inclination routinely obtain every patient ( 30° would give result ) several study show conflict result . The continuous suction secretion cuff logical efficacy challenge , partly technical failure due occlusion aspiration system gravity prevents tracheal secretion clearance . The selective decontamination digestive tract effective particularly prevent early VAP , limit potential role global increase resistance antibiotic . Oral decontamination Chlorhexidine iodine polyvidon reduce VAP . Using drug increase gastric pH prevent stress ulcer favor gastric bacterial growth VAP . Using gastric pro-kinetics post-pyloric enteral nutrition reduce VAP . Alternate prone positioning , proven improve outcome ARDS patient reduce incidence VAP , potentially favor pharyngeal drainage mouth . The use heat moisture exchanger limit airway dry ventilation , seem good heat humidifiers reduce VAP . Recently , use positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) show reduce volume inhalation around cuff . Finally , mask ventilation , preserve upper airway integrity , case allow sufficient ventilation replacement , associate substantial reduction VAP . In patient ventilate oro-tracheal tube , rational use mention technique allow reach low VAP incidence rate , completely eradicate infection . The cuff tracheal tube currently recommend routinely use long-term ( 2 day ) ventilation make polyvinyl chloride high volume cylindrical shape , allow low pressure inflation , design cover tracheal wall without induce ischemic lesion tracheal mucosa . Such lesion responsible laryngeal edema - clinical stridor extubation occur around 12 % patient - , rarely granuloma stenosis induce sequela disable and/or difficult repair surgery . The use tube coat antiseptic currently investigation . Protection tracheal lesion induce tracheal tube require regular frequent assessment cuff pressure day night time . Recent experimental study show cuff bad protector micro-inhalations around cuff . Several company provide u new polyurethane cuff tube , physical characteristic associate - VITRO , animal trachea , general anesthesia well tightness polyvinyl chloride cuff . They also provide u conic shape cuff , make either PVC polyurethane . Authors find Hi-Lo SEALGUARD cuff similar capability prevent methylene blue leakage , others find preventive effect pressure control Hi-Lo cuff VAP . A reduction early VAP observe one series cardiac surgery . Our hypothesis tracheal tube polyurethane and/or conic shape cuff associate low colonization tracheal tree day follow tracheal intubation , tubes cylindrical polyvinyl chloride cuff . The patient allocate randomized cluster four group : 1 ) cylindrical PVC cuff , 2 ) cylindrical polyurethane cuff , 3 ) conic PVC cuff 4 ) conic polyurethane cuff . In four group , tube insert conventional technique tracheal intubation general anesthesia direct laryngoscopy , inside ICU . The tube cuff immediately inflate 25 cm water plateau pressure level ventilator case high 25 cm water accord current recommendation . The tracheal tube connect ventilator , set volume pressure control mode minimal PEEP 5 cm water . The research conduct accord protocol , follow good clinical practice current recommendation MV Intensive Care practice propose French Society Intensive Care Medicine ( www.srlf.org ) European Society Intensive Care Medicine ( www.ESICM.org ) . Principal endpoint ( ) : quantitative assessment bacterial colonization oro-pharyngeal ( cuff ) tracheal ( cuff ) secretions 2 hour ( H2 ) , 1 day ( D1 ) , D2 D3 intubation . The collection secretion cuff allow document origin tracheal bacteria . The bacterial quantity sample compare patient group establish role cuff antibacterial protection lower airway . The oro-pharyngeal tracheal sample perform 2 hour oro-pharyngeal application Chlorhexidine tracheal aspiration . Bacterial culture do standard medium quantitative culture carry serial dilution sample . Secondary endpoint : VAP occurrence : diagnosis VAP base positive result protect specimen brush ( 103 cfu/mL ) broncho-alveolar lavage ( 2 % infected cell 104 cfu/mL ) . Distal bronchial sample perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy several follow criterion suggestive VAP present , correspond CPIS score least equal 6 : fever , new chest X-ray opacity , hyper-leucocytosis , arterial oxygenation alteration . Cross-over cluster randomization : individual randomization almost impossible achieve , emergency set decision tracheal intubation ICU . Therefore choose ascribe random period every tracheal tube ICU study protocol give period . The random plan different participate ICU . Each ICU perform period 10 patient . Each ICU intend recruit 10 patient period around 2 month . The physician charge patient keep blind bacteriological sample result . This prevent modify clinical practice accord result particularly influence clinical suspicion VAP and/or stridor .</detailed_description>
