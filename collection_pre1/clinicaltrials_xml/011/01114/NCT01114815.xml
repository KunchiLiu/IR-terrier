	<brief_summary>The purpose study delineate early neurological feature progression patient cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy subcortical infarct leukoencephalopathy ( CADASIL ) order facilitate early diagnosis , prevent erroneous diagnosis mistreatment improve physician education relatively common yet under-recognized dementing disorder . Patients CADASIL suffer variant migraine differs wild type migraine term severity , progressive nature underlie pathophysiology . Recurrent stereotypic acute confusional state associate headache episodes patient CADASIL distinctive phenomenon , recognize lead earlier accurate diagnosis condition . Specific Aims : - Characterize nature , frequency severity migraine patient CADASIL . - Delineate phenomenon acute confusional migraine distinct subgroup migraine establish prevalence patient CADASIL . - Determine latency onset neurological symptom include migraine , diagnosis CADASIL prevalence misdiagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Research Study Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy With Subcortical Infarcts Leukoencephalopathy ( CADASIL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New York University School Medicine , Division Neurogenetics conduct new research study patient CADASIL ( cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy subcortical infarct leukoencephalopathy ) . We invite anyone age 18 old confirm diagnosis CADASIL participate . We greatly appreciate help regard . Please assure participate , information , relatives physician provide hold strict confidence . CADASIL often misdiagnosed due lack awareness condition among health care provider disease closely mimic neurological condition . People CADASIL struggle find doctor knowledge condition . The purpose study well understand early symptom CADASIL doctor may learn diagnose early . This research study base review medical information provide health care giver . If interested , please contact u telephone . We mail questionnaire fill return u , request copy brain MRI , test result office note doctor . We contact people detail telephone interview . Your response questionnaire still valuable even get record . The estimated time complete questionnaire two hour . The telephone interview ( applicable ) expect last 30 45 minute . It may helpful involve family member friend complete questionnaire . If wish participate study , please call research office.We tell project , wish participate , mail questionnaire return envelope .
