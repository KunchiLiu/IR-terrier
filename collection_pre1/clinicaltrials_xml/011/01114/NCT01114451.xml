	<brief_summary>Whenever person cesarean section risk problem heal wound . The common type wound heal problem separation open skin fatty tissue beneath skin . This type wound heal problem happens often patient high body weight . In case , metal staple use bring skin together close wound . Usually , staple leave place long time woman heavy , hop decrease chance wound heal problem . But known leaving staple long time actually helpful . In case , leave staple longer may cause pain require see doctor get staple take . The purpose study see difference wound heals heavy woman cesarean section skin staple remove short period time versus long period time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Delayed Skin Staple Removal Following Cesarean Delivery Obese Patient</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cesarean delivery obese gravida associate numerous perioperative risk , frequent postoperative wound disruption , mean incidence 15 % . With exception closure subcutaneous adipose layer , useful measure decrease wound complication obese gravida either studied lack sufficient evidence upon base recommendation . One intervention delay removal surgical skin staple . Skin stapler , first introduce 1980 's , `` grandfathered '' United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval process , since become widely utilized technique skin closure . Although neither FDA device manufacturer make specific recommendation , skin staple commonly leave situ anywhere 3 - 10 day . The physiologic rationale delay staple removal unclear . Wound heal involves four main stage include hemostasis , inflammation , granulation , remodel . Each phase break overlapping step . Reapproximation skin edge staple enables epithelialization , result wound closure thin layer cell 48 hour post-operatively . Although overall wound healing appear delayed set obesity , whether specific process epithelialization affect unknown . Therefore , may physiologic basis delay staple removal obese woman . Furthermore , delay staple removal potentially negative effect patient care may balance clinical benefit . Delayed staple removal may associate prolongation patient discomfort , additional clinical visit increase associated cost . These issue cause u question whether practice delay skin staple removal obese woman warrant . Therefore , clinical trial design compare wound heal outcome cesarean follow early ( postoperative day # 3 ) versus delay ( postoperative day # 7 - 10 ) skin staple removal obese patient .</detailed_description>
