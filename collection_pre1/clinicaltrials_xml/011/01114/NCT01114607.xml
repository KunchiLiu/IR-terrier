	<brief_title>A Study Assess Relative Bioavailability Four New Formulations GSK1605786 Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , single-dose , five-period , crossover study healthy volunteer compare relative bioavailability 5 oral GSK1605786 formulation . Recruitment/screening occur within approximately 30 day first schedule dose study medication . Each subject participate five dose session - dose separate least seven day . The total duration subject 's participation study , Screening Follow-up , approximately 10 week . All subject receive single 500mg dos follow five GSK1605786 formulation : A. ChemoCentryx formulation GSK1605786 ; 2 x 250mg capsule [ Formulation A ] B. GSK formulation GSK1605786 ; 2 x 250mg capsule [ Formulation B ] C. GSK direct-fill formulation GSK1605786 ; 2 x 250mg capsule [ Formulation C ] D. GSK modify formulation GSK1605786 ; 2 x 250mg capsule [ Formulation D ] E. GSK tablet formulation GSK1605786 ; 500mg tablet [ Formulation E ] Formulations A B administer period 1 2 random order , formulation C , D E administer period 3 , 4 , 5 random order . Subjects check clinical research unit ( CRU ) 1 day prior dose ( Day -1 ) . The study medication administer morning Day 1 240 mL water 30 minute standard breakfast ( i.e. , fed state ) . For treatment period , subject stay CRU 48-hour PK sample morning Day 3 . Subjects may release clinic Day 3 ( require study procedure complete ) return CRU even next morning collection 60- 72-hour PK sample . Upon completion last dosing period early withdrawal , subject return clinic approximately seven day last dose study medication follow visit subsequently discharge study . The study conduct one center .</detailed_description>
