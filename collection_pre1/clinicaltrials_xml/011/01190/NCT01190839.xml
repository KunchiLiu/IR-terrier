	<brief_title>A Multicenter Trial Comparing REMICADE ( Infliximab ) Placebo Prevention Recurrence Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) Patients Undergoing Surgical Resection Who Are Increased Risk Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess effect REMICADE ( infliximab ) prevent relapse Crohn 's disease surgical resection . Patients assign group initially receive either infliximab placebo . Each patient allow join study put group chance ( randomly ) , like flip coin . There possibility patient receive study drug placebo different time study . If patient initially randomize receive placebo , study doctor confirm return active Crohn 's Disease symptom , receive infliximab . If patient initially randomize receive infliximab , study doctor confirm experience symptom Crohn 's Disease , may receive increase infliximab dose . Infusions administer Week 0 every 8 week thereafter Week 200 . The study use measure Crohn 's Disease activity evaluate visit time patient symptom suggestive disease get bad order capture recurrence . During study , patient meet study definition clinical recurrence eligible blind infliximab dose increase 5 mg/kg . In word , patient receive placebo would receive infliximab 5 mg/kg , patient receive infliximab 5 mg/kg would dose increase 10 mg/kg . Approximately 175 site utilized , approximately 290 patient enrol . The interval first last dose study agent 200 week . The planned duration study participation maximum 209 week ( 1-week screening period , 200-week treatment period , final study visit Week 208 ) . Group I ( infliximab infusion ) : infliximab ( 5 mg/kg ) administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion Week 0 every 8 week thereafter Week 200 . Group II ( placebo infusion ) : placebo administer IV infusion Week 0 every 8 week thereafter Week 200</detailed_description>
