	<detailed_description>This protocol single-arm , three-cohort , phase II multicenter study design ass safety efficacy VMP VCP VP up-front treatment elderly MM patient . The combination weekly subcutaneous administration Velcade continuous low-dose melphalan prednisone ( VMP ) continuous low-dose cyclophosphamide prednisone ( VCP ) Velcade low-dose prednisone could effective well tolerate ( VP ) . Patients evaluate scheduled visit 3 study period : pre-treatment , treatment long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) . The pre-treatment period include screen visit , perform study entry . After provide write informed consent participate study , patient evaluate study eligibility . The screening period include availability inclusion criterion describe . The treatment period include induction maintenance . Subjects receive : 1 . Induction therapy : nine 4-week course Velcade/Melphalan/Prednisone ( VMP ) nine 4-week course Velcade/Cyclophosphamide/Prednisone ( VCP ) Nine 4-week course Velcade/Prednisone ( VP ) . 2 . Maintenance therapy : Velcade alone During induction period patient attend periodic study centre visit schedule Velcade administration order ass toxicity efficacy treatment . During maintenance period , patient attend study centre visit every 4 week , development confirm PD . The response assess cycle . During LTFU period , development confirm PD , patient follow survival LTFU period every 3 month via telephone office visit . The duration treatment period , include maintenance treatment approximately 3 year . The duration LTFU approximately 2 year , total 5 year . occurance PD determine duration progression-free survival patient ( secondary objective ) . The occurrence death determine duration overall survival ( secondary objective ) .</detailed_description>
