	<brief_title>Targeted Therapy Selection Based Tumor Tissue Kinase Activity Profiles Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies , Exploratory Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific signal protein important tumor growth target agent . These call target agent targeted treatment . Thus far , unclear patient respond targeted agent . It assume response agent depend specific receptor protein signal activity tumor tissue . The investigator propose kinase activity profiling may potential clinical diagnostic tool predict tumor response target treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor . The investigator determine ex vivo kinase activity inhibition profile tumor tissue different target agent . Tumor tissue patient advance cancer standard treatment available use . Patients treat select targeted agent clinical benefit determine .</detailed_description>
