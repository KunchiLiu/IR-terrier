	<brief_summary>Successful treatment non-small cell lung cancer radiation therapy require physician determine exactly tumor body , protect normal tissue . This study design apply functional imaging , Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) treatment , treatment see procedure help predict well treatment work cancer well lung function treatment . FDG-PET modern technology use small amount radioactive glucose ( FDG ) make image whole body area active cancer . A Computerized Tomography ( CT ) also perform along procedure help researcher see clearly cancer healthy lung locate . The study help investigator determine whether adaptive plan apply base repeat PET-CT imaging course radiation therapy ( RT ) , show improvement treatment outcome compare treated standard radiation therapy . This adaptive plan may allow doctor escalate dose per treatment total dose treatment base risk damage healthy lung tissue . While increase radiation dose , limit toxicity normal lung tissue , researcher hope improve tumor control .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must FDGavid pathologically proven nonsmall cell lung cancer . If pathology definitive , patient need clinically diagnose nonsmall cell lung cancer , also FDGavid . Patients must 18 year age old . Patients must Karnofsky performance score &gt; 60 . Patients must clinical AJCC ( American Joint Committee Cancer ) Stage IIIIB , unresectable inoperable disease . Patients must evidence malignant pleural pericardial effusion Patients must hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm/dl . Transfusions medication may use achieve criterion . Patients must reasonable organ marrow function define chemotherapy consider : WBC ( White Blood Cell ) &gt; 3,000/mm3 . absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm3 . platelet &gt; 100,000/mm3 total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dl .
