	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Assess Effects Lacosamide Sleep Wake Adults With Focal Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.1 . Background Epilepsy common disorder affect approximately 1 % population include nearly 2 million people United States . Excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) common complaint people epilepsy , report many 50 % case . EDS long attribute effect antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) seizures , assumption adequately test . In recent year , primary sleep disorder , sleep apnea , identify potential contributor . A recent questionnaire-based study 486 adult epilepsy find 2-fold high prevalence sleep disturbance patient compare age- matched control ( 39 % vs.18 % ) . The presence sleep disturbance adversely affect quality life ( QOL ) people epilepsy . Despite frequency EDS people epilepsy , surprisingly attempted measure complaint objectively . In study present 2007 Annual Meeting American Academy Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) investigator proposal , prevalence EDS among 92 epilepsy patient assess use three measure : self-reported EDS , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , subjective screening tool use sleep clinic , multiple sleep latency test ( MSLT ) , gold standard objective measurement daytime sleepiness . Seventy-two percent subject endorse EDS ( feel excessively sleepy least day per week last 6 month ) , 37 % abnormal ESS score ( &gt; 10 ) , 62 % abnormal MSLTs ( mean sleep latency [ MSL ] &lt; 8 min ) . The MSL le 5 minute , comparable patient narcolepsy , 36 % case . The correlation self-reported EDS MSL poor . However , find previous study sleep population , good correlation ESS MSL find . Among large epilepsy series use ESS , 11-28 % patient score great 10 , suggest presence EDS . Excessive daytime sleepiness negative predictor QOL sleep disorder patient likely important , overlooked complaint people epilepsy . To date , well-designed trial explore impact specific AED therapy wakefulness , although sedating effect currently available agent demonstrate small series clinical experience . The current study propose objectively measure effect lacosamide ( LCM ) sleep wakefulness adult patient focal epilepsy . 1.2 . Investigational Agent Lacosamide ( [ R ] -2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide ) belong novel class functionalized amino acid . It show animal model antiepileptic property possibly two distinct novel mechanism action . Like many AEDs , LCM effect voltage-gated sodium channel . But unlike AEDs , LCM enhance slow inactivation channel . LCM also interact collapsin-response mediator protein-2 ( CRMP-2 ) may represent novel mechanism , previously recognize AED development . Lacosamide 200-400 mg/day approve US Europe oral IV formulation adjunctive therapy adult focal seizure . 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective To determine effect LCM wakefulness adult focal epilepsy compare change Visit 4 baseline ESS subject randomize LCM versus placebo . Secondary Objectives 1 . To determine effect LCM wakefulness adult focal epilepsy compare change Visit 4 baseline MSL Maintenance Wakefulness Test ( MWT ) subject randomize LCM versus placebo . 2 . To determine impact LCM sleep use ambulatory polysomnography ( PSG ) compare sleep efficiency ( SE ; total sleep time/total record time ) Visit 4 baseline subject randomize LCM versus placebo . 3 . To compare change fatigue use Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) Visit 4 baseline subject randomize LCM versus placebo . 4 . To compare change health- sleep-related QOL Visit 4 baseline subject randomize LCM versus placebo . 3.0 STUDY DESIGN This Phase IV , randomize , single center trial LCM adult subject focal epilepsy . Subjects meet inclusion criterion take stable dos 1 2 marketed AEDs least 4 week randomize double-blind , 4:1 scheme LCM 400 mg/day placebo , respectively . At end Treatment Phase , subject option enter Extension Phase whereby receive LCM titrate 400 mg/day . 4.0 STUDY DRUG Subjects randomize LCM identically package placebo . A 1-step , back-titration LCM 100 mg/day placebo allow case intolerable adverse event ( AE ) end Treatment Phase . A blocked randomization scheme develop used allocate subject active treatment placebo 4:1 ratio . Blocks random size , exceed 10 , ensure appropriate balance treatment group midpoint enrollment study completion . 5.0 STUDY PROCEDURES 5.1 Study Assessments 5.1.1 Sleep Apnea Scale Sleep Disorders Questionnaire ( SA/SDQ ) As part screen process , subject complete SA/SDQ , validate instrument ass likelihood obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) base variable include loud snoring , age , body mass index , tobacco use , hypertension . In original validation , cutoff 32 high woman 36 high men correlate well diagnosis OSA PSG . The following procedure ( subjective assessment , blood sample sleep testing perform baseline ( Visit 2- 2 week window ) Visits 3 ( LCM 200 mg/day ) 4 ( 400 mg/day ) least 11 day longer 21 day prior visit ( least 11 day previous dose adjustment ensure steady state ) . 5.1.2 Ambulatory PSG Overnight ambulatory PSG perform use Sapphire PSG ™ , Cleveland Medical Devices , Inc . The system record electroencephalography ( EEG ; F3/4 , C3/4 , O1/2 ) , electro-oculography ( EOG ; E1 , E2 ) , chin electromyography ( EMG ; 3 channel ) , leg EMG ( 4 channel ) , thermister pressure transducer , respiratory effort ( RIP ) , snore , EKG , pulse oximetry , body position . Remote PSG monitoring video perform use DreamPort™ , Cleveland Medical Devices , Inc. 5.1.3 Maintenance Wakefulness Test ( MWT ) The MWT modification popular MSLT , gold standard objective measurement daytime sleepiness . The MSLT intend measure physiological sleep tendency standardize condition . It base premise degree sleepiness reflect sleep latency . The MWT intend measure one 's ability maintain wakefulness standardize , relatively sedentary condition . 5.1.4 Subjective Sleep Assessments Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) : The ESS self-administered eight-item questionnaire measure subject 's subjective daytime sleep propensity . Subjects ask likely doze fall asleep 8 specific situation watch television rid car ( never , slight , moderate , high : 0-3 ) , total score range 0-24 . It high test-retest reliability high level internal consistency . An ESS score great 10 consider indicative EDS . Self-reported EDS categorize response Yes No question : Have feel excessively sleepy least day per week last 2 week ? Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) : The FSS validate method assess fatigue . It comprise 9 item rat accord Likert-type scale 1 7 , 1 indicate impairment 7 indicates severe impairment . Responses individual item tally produce total score . 5.1.5 Seizure Sleep Log Subjects record sleep wake time quantify characterize seizure log develop trial . Mean daily seizure frequency , exclude aura , Baseline Visit 4 calculate . 5.1.6 Adverse Events Assessments Adverse Event Profile ( AEP ) : The AEP epilepsy-specific , 19-item questionnaire design monitor frequency common AEs associate AEDs . Subjects rate frequency problem side effect scale 1 ( Never ) 4 ( Always often ) . Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) : The PHQ-9 9-item depression scale base diagnostic criterion major depressive disorder Diagnostic Statistical Manual Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) . It use diagnosis depression monitoring treatment impact depression . A score 10 high indicative moderate severe depression . The PHQ-9 discriminates well individual without depressive disorder . 5.1.7 Quality Life Assessments Quality Life Epilepsy ( QOLIE-31 ) : The QOLIE-31 31-item survey health-related quality life adult epilepsy . The survey derive long , 89-item instrument . Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory ( PSQI ) : The PSQI self-rating questionnaire measure subjective sleep quality . A global score produce represent sum seven component score , address specific aspect subjective sleep quality . Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ( FOSQ ) : The FOSQ self-administered 30-item questionnaire offer measurement functional status relate impact daytime sleepiness daily activity . It measure effect activity level , vigilance , intimacy sexual relationship , general productivity social outcome . 5.2 Subjects 5 6 visit Visit 1 ( Baseline Phase - 2 week ) Visit 2 ( Randomization , Start Treatment Phase - least 2 week Visit 1 exceed 8 week ) Visit 3 ( Treatment Phase , LCM 200 mg/day - 11 -21 day Visit 2 ) Visit 4 ( Treatment Phase , LCM 400 mg/day - 11-21 day Visit 3 ) At completion study procedure , subject offer option enter 4-week Extension Phase 2-week Taper Phase . In Extension Phase , investigator subject remain blinded initial group assignment subject treat LCM . Subjects LCM arm continue 400 mg/day . Those placebo arm undergo 4-week titration schedule . All subject continue maintain seizure sleep diary . Subjects decline participation Extension Phase undergo 2-week Taper Phase whereby LCM taper 200 mg/day per week . Visit 5 ( Final Visit Nonextenders , begin Extension Phase - 0-21 day Visit 4 ) For subject opt enter Extension Phase , subjective assessment perform least 4 day initiation LCM 200mg/day ensure test complete achieve steady state .
