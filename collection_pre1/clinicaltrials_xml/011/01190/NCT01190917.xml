	<detailed_description>Despite fact social skill impairment persistent pervasive symptom affect individual ASD , treatment target social skill subject control investigation . The available literature suggest cognitive behavioral technique commonly use may improve target social skill individual ASD . However , draw firm conclusion efficacy social skill treatment remain difficult , particularly respect maintenance skill generalization natural setting , owe methodological limitation extant study ( e.g. , small sample size , lack manual-based curriculum , minimal assessment generalization maintenance ) . Several neuroimaging study find individual ASD underactivate key brain region involve social cognition . However , also evidence suggest factor increase attention interest social stimuli associate normal brain activity . The purpose investigation examine acute sustain effect social skill treatment social cognition neural architecture support . High-functioning child ASD randomly assign 12-week cognitive behavioral social skill group social play-based therapy group . For type group , parent session hold concurrently . Functional MRI scan well behavioral assessment social cognition , adaptive functioning , symptom severity acquire baseline , immediately follow treatment , 3-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
