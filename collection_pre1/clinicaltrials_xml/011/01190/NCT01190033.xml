	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . In initial phase , 100 patient chronic low back pain include study . The patient recruit magazine newspaper take part screen treatment low back pain . This screen involve evaluation data history physical examination classify patient group nonspecific low back pain , exclude patient neurological alteration so-called Red-Flags . Procedures After initial screening patient undergo diagnostic block medial branch lumbar vertebra L2 , L3 , L4 , L5 first sacral vertebra ( S1 ) lidocaine control distilled water . The patient present 50 % pain improvement , evaluate Likert scale 30 minute form study group , patient present pain improvement lidocaine present pain improvement distil water exclude . The medial branch block consist insertion 90mm , 25-gauge needle skin radioscopic control medial branch topography . Infusion 1ml 2 % lidocaine perform medial branch abovementioned vertebrae . Control execute manner yet infusion 1ml distilled water . Through use diagnostic block 40 patient select second phase study . Once defined study group evaluate procedure Oswestry , Roland Morris , SF-36 VAS questionnaire . In second phase study patient randomize . The random division two group perform computerized program random number . The randomization result keep matt seal envelope guarantee secrecy allocation . The neurolysis procedure carry first group , consist 20 patient , placebo sham procedure second group , also 20 patient . The neurolysis procedure carry sterile condition , patient lie prone neurotome insertion site anesthetize 2ml 1 % lidocaine . The neurotome ( Smith &amp; Nephew - RF ) use procedure . The neurotome radiofrequency apparatus mount 10cm electrode type 22 needle 5mm exposure tip . The neurotome introduce percutaneously manner similar adopt medial branch block radioscopic control . The temperature electrode placement correct position raise 80 Â°C 90 second . Two neurotomies perform facet , one proximally distally , due double innervation facet . In patient placebo group procedure temperature neurotome raise . This perform blind manner , start procedure , surgeon show assistant turn device envelope contain patient 's group ( placebo neurotomy ) , yet surgeon inform whether device turn , perform procedure manner group . The patient reevaluate first month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month procedure . The assessor inform group patient belongs , scale perform preoperative period use .</brief_summary>
