	<brief_summary>Only medication approve treatment alcohol dependence exist substantial need discover way provide effective treatment . Accordingly , identify new potential neuropharmacological target treatment alcohol dependence represent high priority public health . Ghrelin 28-amino acid peptide act endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) . Ghrelin first isolate stomach , central hypothalamic production ghrelin also demonstrate . Ghrelin play key role regulation appetite . Consistent common neurobiological substrate control food alcohol consumption , preclinical investigation suggest ghrelin play role neurobiology alcohol dependence , thus represent new potential neuropharmacology target . In keep preclinical study , human investigation show alcohol consumption affect blood ghrelin level blood ghrelin level significantly positively correlate crave measurement alcohol-dependent individual . The effect exogenous ghrelin inject intravenous ( i.v . ) alcohol-dependent individual , however , never investigate . The current project propose randomize double-blind placebo-controlled 3-group between-subject laboratory study aim investigating effect exogenous ghrelin i.v . non-treatment seek alcohol-dependent subject term urge drink , attention cue related psychophysiological measure . This project goal : ) conduct alcohol laboratory study test role ghrelin i.v. , therefore demonstrate feasibility study safety ghrelin i.v . administer alcohol-dependent individual ; ii ) explore effect ghrelin i.v . alcohol crave assess controlled condition , cue-reactivity ( CR ) experiment . This study address whether alcohol craving affect ghrelin level modify acutely via ghrelin i.v . injection . Given crucial need expand understand underlie neurobiology alcoholism , study potentially lead identify new target development pharmacological treatment may improve intervention alcohol dependent individual .</brief_summary>
