	<brief_summary>This evaluation aim investigate cost-effective way build capacity care prevention infectious disease among mid-level practitioner ( MLP ) sub-Saharan Africa . Classroom base training continue dominant form training , despite evidence suggest on-site support ( OSS ) beneficial . Definitive evidence on-site support effective way deliver require output related outcome still lack . IDCAP provide two intervention integrate training TB , HIV/AIDS malaria well infectious disease , effect study : 1 ) Integrated Management Infectious Disease ( IMID ) training program individual MLP , 2 ) On-site support ( OSS ) team health professional . This study employ mixed design pre/post cluster randomize trial component . Interventions level individual participant IMID level site ( health facility ) OSS . All participant attend 3-week course , follow two 1-week booster course six month period . After 3-week course , randomize arm half sample facility also receive OSS every month 9 month bi-monthly 6 additional month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There four major component evaluation design describe : 1 ) Site Assessment , 2 ) Competence practice individual MLP participate IDT , 3 ) Facility cost performance indicator , 4 ) Mortality survey . The site assessment guide curriculum development site selection . As show Figure 1 , occur Year 1 . The effect IMID OSS competence individual MLP evaluate write case scenario vignette . Data case scenario collect three time : ) training , b ) three-week course , c ) nine-month program include two , one-week booster course distance learning . To estimate effect IMID , aggregate change test score across 3 time point arm analyze jointly . To estimate effect OSS , difference change test score start three-week course end nine-month program compare across 2 arm . The effect practice individual trainee evaluate clinical assessment mobile team faculty five outpatient visit five HIV clinic visit individual MLP . Data clinical assessment collect two time : ) training , b ) nine-month program . Facility performance indicator collect monthly basis site . Sites randomly assign begin OSS either Phase 1 Phase 2 facility indicator two sample site compare . The principal investigator IDCAP actively consider collect data mortality among child five , final decision make . At request act chairperson SOMREC , include information potential activity . Mortality survey would conduct OSS .</detailed_description>
