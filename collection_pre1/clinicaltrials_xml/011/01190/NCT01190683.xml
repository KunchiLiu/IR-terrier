	<brief_summary>Vitamin D deficiency widely prevalent India . Serum 25 ( OH ) D level &lt; 20 ng /ml 90 % . Recently , randomize control trial , investigator show dual cholecalciferol calcium supplementation lead significant improvement hand grip strength distance cover six minute walk test . Present study take understand functional significance 25 ( OH ) D term effect Skeletal muscle strength include surface electromyography ( EMG ) large cohort involve approximately 200 subject . The impact calcium vitamin D supplementation would assess supplement alone combination . Besides , investigator would also assess impact supplementation Th1/Th2 cytokines expression peripheral mononuclear cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vitamin D essential nutrient play important role calcium metabolism bone health . In recent year , biomarkers like PTH , calcium absorption use define relevant biological index vitamin D nutritional status . Several study India show wide prevalence vitamin D deficiency ( VDD ) India . Goswami et al study serum 25 ( OH ) D level functional significance apparently healthy subject reside Delhi show low serum 25 ( OH ) D value group ( Am J Clin Nutr 2000 ) . Its functional significance currently evaluation . Relevant study assess functional significance VDD Asian Indians summarize ( Am J Clin Nutr 2000 ) . A ) Goswami et al report low serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration healthy subject Delhi , show high serum PTH level &amp; significant inverse relation serum 25 ( OH ) D PTH level ( r = -0.6303 , p &lt; 0.001 ) three group ( soldier , physician &amp; nurse , depigmented person ) study winter ( Am J Clin Nutr 2006 ) B ) Effects BMD Recently , analyze relationship BMD serum 25 ( OH ) D 105 apparently healthy Asian Indian . The cohort 105 subject split 2 group serum 25 ( OH ) D cutoff 9.0 ng/mL . The mean serum iPTH significantly high group 1 ( &lt; 9.0 ng/ml ) group 2 subject ( 53.1±31.3 39.3±17.5 pg/mL , respectively ; P=0.012 ) .The mean BMD value total hip , include femoral neck , trochanter , intertrochanter , significantly ( P = 0.001 ) low group 1 group 2 . C ) Effect VDD intestinal calcium absorption Asian Indians chronic hypovitaminosis D change cholecalciferol supplementation study recently Department Endocrinology Metabolism . Study subject 29 apparently healthy volunteer [ 17 M , 12 F , mean ( SD ) age = 28.4 ± 6.4 year ] low serum 25 ( OH ) D level [ mean ( SD ) = 7.6 ± 4.8 ng/ml ] . Intestinal calcium absorption assess 'calcium load test ' ( PAK test ) ( 10 ) use 1 gm oral elemental calcium load ( n = 26 ) supplementation oral cholecalciferol ( 60,000 IU/week eight week ) . This study show vitamin D Deficiency physiologically relevant term intestinal calcium absorption Asian Indians ( Journal Human Nutrition dietetics 2010 ) . Recently randomize control trial show significant improvement muscle strength walk distance dual supplementation cholecalciferol calcium ( Clin Endocrinol 2010 ) . In current study plan study aspect recruit four group study effect calcium vitamin D supplementation alone combination dual supplementation . Baseline evaluation ( Before vitamin D supplementation ) would include serum total calcium , inorganic phosphorus , alkaline phosphatase , intact PTH 25 ( OH ) D assay , hand grip muscle strength surface EMG testing . Hand grip would do do use computerized dynamometer Department Physical Medicine Rehabilitation guidance Professor U Singh , Head , Department Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation , AIIMS . Handgrip strength measure right hand dynamometer . The average two measurement grip strength use analysis ( kg ) . The physical performance test perform 6 - minute walk test use standard protocol result interpret term 6 minute walk distance meter degree shortness breath use modify Borg dyspnea scale . The mRNA expression Th1 Th2 cytokine would assess PBMC draw 5 ml peripheral blood use real time PCR . Vitamin D supplementation All subject randomize three treatment group one placebo group double blind manner . Random code would generate investigator , involve distribution medicine assessment muscle strength Active drug would calcium ( two tablet calcium carbonate contain 500 mg elemental calcium/day , 60,000 IU cholecalciferol/week obtain commercial source . The inactive drug would lactose contain identical placebo obtain source . All study subject provide packet contain four sachet cholecalciferol ( contain 60000 IU vitamin D3 ; Cadila Pharmaceutical , India ) /placebo ; sixty tablet calcium carbonate ( 500mg elemental calcium &amp; 250 IU vitamin D3 ; Elder Pharmaceutical , India ) /placebo . First dose supervise . Subjects counsel daily intake two tablet calcium carbonate weekly intake cholecalciferol sachet follow completion 4 week . Similar packet give 4 week follow . Drug compliance assess count empty sachet . After eight week subject provide daily two tablet calcium carbonate contain 500 mg elemental calcium two sachet cholecalciferol every month four month . Assessment 8 week 6 month would include serum intact PTH &amp; 25 ( OH ) D level estimation , skeletal muscle strength testing , 6 minute walk test Th1/Th2 analysis Safety Proposed Interventions Cholecalciferol dose 60000 IU/week × 8 week consider safe use healthy subject , show recent study .</detailed_description>
