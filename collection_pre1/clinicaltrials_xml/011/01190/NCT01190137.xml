	<brief_summary>There two different type vitamin D - vitamin D3 ( animal source ) vitamin D2 ( plant source ) . Almost usual vitamin D preparation infant available Canadian pharmacy contain vitamin D3 may suitable family avoid animal product social religious reason . The purpose study learn two form vitamin D blood level vitamin D similar infant take . Forty-eight breastfed infant randomly assign 400 IU either vitamin D2 D3 supplement 3 month start 1 month age . The difference blood vitamin D level , 3 month supplementation , two group help determine two supplement equal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Two Isoforms Vitamin D Supplements Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D important develop strong bone teeth well prevent rickets , childhood bone disease bone get soft bend . investigator know vitamin D produce cell skin sunny month year concern safety sun exposure infant . As well breast milk contains little vitamin D. It reason Health Canada recommend breast fed baby receive 400 IU vitamin D per day . There two different type vitamin D - vitamin D3 ( animal source ) vitamin D2 ( plant source ) . Standard infant preparation Canada tend vitamin D3 form . To date , insufficient information judge equivalency 400 IU vitamin D2 D3 give daily young Canadian infant . In view 1 million Canadian family practice vegetarianism , would appear important yet answer question . The investigator extrapolate adult data infant physiology immature relative adult absorption , especially fat soluble vitamin differs . This area need well evaluate emphasize optimal isoform vitamin D infancy necessary development adequate bone mass . This study aim compare relative ability equal daily intake vitamin D2 D3 , amount ( 400 IU/d ) currently recommend Health Canada , support circulate 25 ( OH ) D concentration 3 month supplementation breastfed newborn . In particular , whether supplement equally effective ability achieve sustain optimal plasma 25 ( OH ) D concentration , define 25 ( OH ) D value 75-225 nmol/L . Design : Randomized clinical trial 48 , 1 month old infant , randomize either vitamin D2 D3 isoform standard care dosage ( 400 IU daily ) 3 month ; sufficient time observe change vitamin D status ascribe supplement . Infant physiology immature evolve time stabilize 25-hydroxy vitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) approximately 3 week ( half-life ) . Supplements double blind participant , investigator staff . Recruitment : Infants recruit 1 large primary care center locate great Montreal area . The goal infant begin study 4 week age range +/- 2 week . Rolling recruitment 9 month period 3 month follow-up beginning May 2010 . This cover synthesize non synthesize period vitamin D. This age group select ( first month life ) since vitamin D store transfer mother begin decrease owe 15 30 day half life 25 ( OH ) D. After point , infant need source vitamin D breast milk sunshine . Because majority Canadian infant breastfed least 3-6 month age first 4 month life appear important time frame examine relative potency 2 isoforms . Frequency duration follow : Infants follow 3 month 2 visit , baseline ( ~1 month ) end study ( ~4 month ) . Visits include anthropometric assessment blood collection assessment 25 ( OH ) D parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) concentration . Bottles supplement weigh upon receipt return compliance . As well , parent ask self-report compliance visit . In order encourage continue supplementation 3 month intervention , investigator plan schedule reminder phone call approximately 1½ month post baseline visit . Vitamin D supplementation infant prior initial visit ( birth visit 1 ) document , consider systematic error . Maternal baseline information collect first visit include demographic , ethnicity , pregnancy history sun exposure pregnancy . This data use characterize study population . At visit , health status sun exposure sunscreen use infant assess . A computerized narrow band reflectometer utilized measure skin pigmentation unexposed skin inner upper arm forehead . Procedures perform use guideline establish European Society Contact Dermatitis . This test estimate melanin content skin influence vitamin D status . Sample procurement : At visit , blood collect infant use capillary blood sample mother venipuncture . All sample take 8 10 control diurnal variation . Approximately 1 ml heparinized blood collect infant via heel/finger prick 5 ml mother . Plasma 25 ( OH ) D PTH concentration : Response supplementation evaluate change plasma 25 ( OH ) D PTH . Mothers 25 ( OH ) D status also obtain determine group similar mother 's vitamin D status affect infant 's vitamin store risk hypovitaminosis . Mother 's vitamin D status also allow u good establish total infant vitamin D exposure maternal placental transfer vitamin D. If change , proportion 25 ( OH ) D target examine . Both vitamin D PTH measure use automate chemiluminescent assay system ( Liaison , Diasorin ) . All analysis complete laboratory meeting performance target set Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme ( DEQAS ) . Anthropometry : Infant 's weight , length head circumference take visit . Gestational age document vaccination booklet . Growth assess use triplicate measurement weight ( near g without clothing/diaper use digital infant scale ) head circumference ( near 0.1 cm use non-stretchable tape ) . Data express absolute unit z-scores use data World Health Organization growth chart age . Mother 's weight , height body composition ( % body fat use bioelectrical impendence measure accurately describe population . Infant nutrition : Information infant feeding status ( exclusively , predominately breastfed formula fed ) collect visit well reminder telephone call ( approximately 1½ post supplementation ) . If formula consume , information specific amount consume , frequency , brand well additional multivitamins/minerals also collect . Mother 's nutrition : Mother 's vitamin D intake diet supplement assess lactation use 24 hour recall , use US Department Agriculture 5-step multiple-pass method dietary recall , conduct register dietitian visit . The correct assessment 25 ( OH ) D dietary food record limit current food source vitamin D ( fish ) consume weekly times/month . 24-hours recall likely miss important food source thus , Canadian adapt Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire complete assess last 3 month usual food intake . Safety : Participants find optimal range vitamin D [ 25 ( OH ) D ≤ 75 nmol/L , 30 ng/ml ] value exceed 225 nmol/L [ 90 ng/ml ] 3-month supplementation period , upon participant consent , contact refer pediatrician appropriate treatment . If permit participant , physician contact directly result . Both maternal infant 25 ( OH ) D value collect visit 2 make available participant .</detailed_description>
