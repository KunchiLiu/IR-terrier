	<brief_summary>Procedural pain neonate recently acknowledge entity many study use pharmacological well non pharmacological intervention alleviation pain do . Of , sucrose without non nutritive suck widely study accepted form pain relief . Its analgesic effect think mediate endogenous opioid pathway activate sweet taste ( orogustatory effect ) . Although , guideline base systematic review meta-analysis pain management recommend use sucrose solution pain relief procedure , use repeat dos sucrose preterm neonate require investigation . Pain may profound consequence preterm neonate critical time brain development . Data derive animal model suggest repeat painful stimulus may result structural functional reorganization nervous system alteration future pain response . Early pain experience critical period development think immediate long term consequence could influence physiological , behavioral developmental outcome . Early repetitive procedural pain related stress preterm neonate associate poor neurobehaviour first 2 year life.1 This study aim assess effect repeat painful stimulus short term neurobehaviour preterm infant efficacy repeat dos sucrose use pain relief .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DEFINITION OF PAIN - unpleasant sensory emotional experience actual potential damage describe term damage ( note inability communicate verbally non verbally negate possibility individual pain need appropriate pain relieve treatment ) HISTORICAL BACKGROUND- clinician emerge period relative neglect neonatal pain recognize immediate long term impact pain neonatal development well need alleviate pain effectively . Neonatal pain acknowledge Paediatric society American Academy Paediatrics Canadian paediatric society ( 2000 ) adopt specific guideline pain relief neonate . LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CHRONIC PAIN -Early repeat procedural pain NICU propose one factor may contribute alter development cognition , motor function behaviour infant child bear preterm.The vulnerability preterms well establish due low pain threshold , sensitization repeat pain immature system maintain homeostasis .For infant extremely immature physiological neurobehavioural system , continual adaptation repeat challenge induces long term alteration pain sensitivity , might affect generalized stress arousal system potentially affect develop cytotexture brain . The physiologic perturbation associate early prolong exposure episodic pain appear contribute alter rapidly develop stress system .Exposure painful procedure early neonatal period affect long term neurobehavioural outcome . SCALE USED TO ASSESS SHORT TERM NEUROBEHAVIOUR NAPI ( NEUROBEHAVIOURAL ASSESSMENT OF PRETERM INFANT ) -The NAPI appropriate infant 32 week post conceptional age term . It assess relative maturity function preterm infant , high score reflect high maturity , differentiate 2 week PCA . The clinical validity sensitivity NAPI establish use index medical complication base 1-5 classification range degree complications21 The item motor development cluster include ventral suspension , prone head raising , crawl reflex , forearm recoil , power active movement , vigor spontaneous movement .The alertness orientation item include percent time alert state , duration quality alertness , quantitative response inanimate animate visual auditory stimulation qualitative rating express nature response . LACUNAE IN KNOWLEDGE -Preterm infants prone undergo multiple painful procedure due prolong stay neonatal intensive care unit typical vulnerable clinical profile.It prove painful procedure lead long term change pain reactivity also affect long term neurobehavioural outcome preterm infants.When medline search carry subject return result.Currently study try explore short term neurobehavioural outcome preterm baby &gt; 32 week - &lt; 37 week gestation undergo multiple painful procedure NICU stay.The present study thus plan evaluate role sucrose analgesia alleviate pain cause routine NICU procedure period 7 day assess early neurobehavioural outcome baby help well design double blind randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
