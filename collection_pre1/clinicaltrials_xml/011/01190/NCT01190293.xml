	<brief_title>PK Switch Efavirenz Maraviroc Patients Initially Suppressed Efavirenz-containing Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Maraviroc ( MVC ) CCR5 antagonist prevents virus entry block bind R5-tropic HIV cell surface CCR5 co-receptor . The MERIT Study compare MVC EFV , Combivir backbone , initial therapy . Using non-inferiority margin 10 % MVC non-inferior EFV use &lt; 400 copies/ml viral load cut-off fail reach non-inferiority &lt; 50 copies/ml analysis use . Since study perform sensitive tropism assay become routinely available re-analysis MERIT result show patient apparent R5-tropic virus actually non-R5 virus . When patient exclude analysis , MVC achieve non-inferiority compare efavirenz . Of note , subanalysis original MERIT Study individual baseline viral load 100,000 copies/ml demonstrate small numerical difference MVC EFV recipients 69.6 % 71.6 % respectively achieve viral load le 50 copies/ml 48 week . Recent data MOTIVATE Study ( comparison maraviroc placebo optimise background regimen treatment-experienced patient ) show geno2pheno ( genotypic algorithm tropism estimation ) accurate Trofile ( phenotypic assay ) predict response maraviroc . In situation genotypic phenotypic test show discordant result virological response similar demonstrate concordant R5-tropism . Importantly MVC well-tolerated treatment-na√Øve treatment-experienced patient . Overall similar proportion subject experience grade 3/4 adverse event ; importantly , malignancy rate similar two arm ( 4.4 % EFV 2.8 % MVC ) . Broadly , individual adverse event occur similar frequency two arm although abnormal dream , dizziness rash less common MVC . In addition median lipid change great EFV arm , correlate lower predict risk cardiovascular disease MVC recipient . Maraviroc substrate CYP3A4 enzyme ; therefore , metabolism reduce pure CYP3A4 inhibitor ( protease inhibitor ) increase CYP3A4 inducer ( EFV ) . Dose adjustment require MVC co-administered certain protease inhibitor ( reduce 300mg BD 150mg BD ) EFV ( increase 300mg BD 600mg BD ) . When switch protease inhibitor ( PI ) , PI clear rapidly interim dose adjustment would require . EFV , however , clear slowly remain detectable concentration several day continue induce CYP3A4 time stop drug . Therefore , switch EFV MVC , expect EFV may affect MVC concentration period time switch . The length time induce effect EFV persist stop drug unclear . Crucially , induce effect EFV could result sub-therapeutic MVC concentration ( MVC start immediately efavirenz ) initial therapy . Sub-therapeutic drug concentration associate virological failure development resistance . In addition , maintain elevate dose MVC induction effect EFV worn could result adverse event ( hypotension ) hence fact , study , increase dose maintain 2 week period . In conclusion , MVC dose adjustment require co-administration EFV clear , correct dose MVC switch EFV-containing regimen remain unknown .</detailed_description>
