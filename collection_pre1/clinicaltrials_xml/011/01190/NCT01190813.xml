	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety oral levodopa patch versus oral placebo patch treatment residual amblyopia child 7 &lt; 13 year old visual acuity 20/50 20/400 amblyopic eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levodopa Treatment Residual Amblyopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amblyopia common cause monocular visual impairment child young middle-aged adult . Both patch atropine accept treatment modality management moderate amblyopia child . Despite best effort conventional amblyopia treatment , many old child teenager amblyopia fail achieve normal visual acuity amblyopic eye . In previous PEDIG study child 7 12 year old treat atropine patching , 36 % child moderate amblyopia 23 % child severe amblyopia achieve 20/40 good acuity . Many clinician recognize conventional therapy patch atropine universally successful sought alternative . PEDIG discuss several year problem residual amblyopia remain visual acuity deficit could reduce . A number research group evaluate short term use oral levodopa-carbidopa adjunct patch therapy old child .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 7 12 2 . Amblyopia associate strabismus , anisometropia , Criteria strabismus : One follow criterion must meet : Heterotropia distance and/or near fixation examination ( without spectacle ) ; History strabismus surgery ; Documented history strabismus longer present ( judgment investigator could cause amblyopia ) Criteria anisometropia : One follow criterion must meet : ≥0.50 D difference eye spherical equivalent ; ≥1.50 D difference eye astigmatism meridian 3 . Visual acuity , measure eye ( amblyopic eye without cycloplegia ) within 7 day prior enrollment use EETDRS protocol study certify visual acuity tester follow : Visual acuity amblyopic eye 18 67 letter inclusive ( 20/50 20/400 ) Visual acuity fellow eye ≥78 letter ( 20/25 well ) 4 . Current amblyopia treatment ( spectacle ) 12 week least 2 hour occlusion per day prescribe fellow eye immediate preenrollment period . While current treatment , visual acuity improve one line ( 5 letter ) since nonstudy visit least 6 week ago . Both acuity measurement define improvement must do use test method . Treatment atropine time preenrollment period allow . Any treatment prior current patch episode stable acuity acceptable . 5 . Spectacle correction ( applicable ) measurement enrollment visual acuity must meet follow criterion base cycloplegic refraction 6 month old : 1 . Requirements spectacle correction : Spherical equivalent must within 0.50 D fully correct anisometropia . Hypermetropia 3.00D must correct . Hypermetropia must correct 1.50 D spherical equivalent , reduction plus sphere must symmetric two eye . Cylinder power eye must within 0.50 D fully correct astigmatism . Cylinder axis eye within 6 degree axis spectacle cylinder power ≥1.00 D. Myopia amblyopic eye great 0.50 D spherical equivalent must correct , glass must correct myopia 0.25 D overcorrect 0.50 D. 2 . Spectacles meet criterion must wear : visual acuity amblyopic eye stable ( defined 2 consecutive visual acuity measurement test method least 4 week apart improvement one line ( 5 letter ) . 6 . Eye examination within 6 month prior enrollment 7 . Parent available least one year followup , access phone ) , willing contact clinical site Jaeb Center staff 8 . In investigator 's judgment , subject likely comply prescribe treatment ( e.g. , history poor compliance patch treatment ) unlikely continue improve use 2 hour patch per day alone . 1 . Myopia 6.00 D ( spherical equivalent ) either eye . 2 . Current vision therapy orthoptics 3 . Ocular cause reduce visual acuity nystagmus per se exclude subject visual acuity criterion meet 4 . Prior intraocular refractive surgery 5 . History narrowangle glaucoma 6 . Bronchial asthma severe pulmonary disease 7 . Strabismus surgery plan within 26 week 8 . Known allergy levodopa carbidopa 9 . History dystonic reaction 10 . Current use oral iron supplement include multivitamin contain iron treatment levodopacarbidopa 11 . Current use antihypertensive , antidepressant medication , phenothiazine , butyrophenones , risperidone isoniazid , nonspecific monoamine oxidase inhibitor , medication treatment attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 12 .
