	<brief_summary>LEP-ETU novel , proprietary delivery system paclitaxel develop NeoPharm , Inc. Paclitaxel ( currently market Taxol ) anti-microtubular network agent active broad spectrum malignancy . Paclitaxel poor solubility . In order enhance solubility , drug formulate polyoxyethylated castor oil , lead infusion-related hypersensitivity reaction . The NeoPharm LEP-ETU formulate mixture well characterize , synthetic phospholipid cholesterol . This design eliminate need oil . The LEP-ETU formulation improve safety profile necessary administer high dos would commonly use Taxol . The clinical evidence obtain NeoPharm Phase I study show LEP-ETU well tolerate Taxol , indicate high maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) . The current Phase II study design accomplish follow objective : 1 . Assess Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) patient metastatic breast cancer administer 90 minute dose 275 mg/m2 LEP-ETU 2 . To evaluate Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) 3 . To evaluate safety LEP-ETU 275 mg/m2 level , particular peripheral neuropathy 4 . To evaluate Overall Survival ( OS )</brief_summary>
