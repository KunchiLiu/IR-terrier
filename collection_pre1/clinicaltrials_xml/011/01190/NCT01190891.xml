	<brief_title>Physical Therapy Versus Steroid Injection Shoulder Impingement Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dysfunction shoulder report affect 33 % general population generate 5 % consultation general practitioner . Shoulder problem report second high musculoskeletal complaint seek care physical therapist deploy environment . Impingement syndromes occur nearly anyone repeatedly forcefully use upper extremity elevate position , common active duty population , often characterize pain motion . Managed improperly , lead disruption work performance prolong disability . Corticosteroid analgesic injection common procedure orthopedist , rheumatologist , general practitioner use management shoulder pain . Conflicting report systematic review question efficacy corticosteroid injection intervention , include oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Additionally without potential risk infection deleterious effect prolong corticosteroid use include tissue degeneration report animal study well region human body . Manual physical therapy offer non-invasive approach negligible risk three six session show improve strength function patient population . The purpose study evaluate compare effectiveness two intervention commonly use management shoulder impingement syndrome . 1 . Evaluate effect subacromial corticosteroid injection subject 's function pain measure Shoulder Pain Disability Index ( SPADI ) . 2 . Evaluate effect manual physical therapy subject 's function pain measure Shoulder Pain Disability Index ( SPADI ) . 3 . Compare effect size two different intervention patient population shoulder impingement syndrome .</detailed_description>
