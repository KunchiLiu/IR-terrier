	<brief_title>FOLFIRI Alone Versus FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab Versus FOLFIRI Plus E7820 Second-Line Therapy Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , randomize study consist Phase Ib portion : safety run-in period 3 ascending dos E7820 ; Phase II portion : randomize 3-arm design . Approximately 135 patient measurable , nonresectable locally advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma , fail first-line chemotherapy , enrol study ( approximately 15 patient Phase Ib portion 120 patient Phase II portion ) . Patients participate either Phase Ib Phase II portion study . Patients receive plan total 6 cycle study treatment unless occurrence progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , withdrawal Investigator , lose follow-up , death , whichever occur first . After 6 cycle , patient Arm 3 ( FOLFIRI + E7820 ) demonstrate clinical benefit may continue single agent E7820 long clinical benefit sustain treatment well tolerate . If treat physician feel comfortable discontinue chemotherapy 6 cycle , chemotherapy may consider follow discussion medical monitor sponsor .</detailed_description>
