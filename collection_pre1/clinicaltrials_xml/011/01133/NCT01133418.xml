	<brief_summary>Currently , two treatment modality pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) consider evidence-based : ( 1 ) pharmacological ( 2 ) behavioral treatment . Recently , several study show promising result suggest efficacy cognitive training intervention child ADHD . These intervention directly train cognitive function ( i.e. , attention , work memory ) child practice cognitive skill use computerized task . In study , improvement related cognitive training intervention document neuropsychological test , academic task , parent rating child 's ADHD behavior . Given ubiquitous find increased reaction time ( RT ) variability among child ADHD , candidate work group developer modify cognitive training intervention target RT variability . That , train child less variable respond . Initial clinical data intervention suggest intervention exposure improve behavioral outcome . However , appropriate power randomized clinical trial necessary experimentally demonstrate intervention efficacy.Sixty-four ( 64 ) child diagnose ADHD ( either Predominantly Inattentive Type Combined Type ) randomly assign intervention control condition . Children intervention group receive 8 week Computerized Progressive Attention Training ( CPAT ) intervention . Children control group receive CPAT intervention progression difficulty base performance intervention group . Children group assess pre-intervention immediately 8-week training neuropsychological , behavioral , academic outcome measure . Hypothesis-driven data analysis assess intervention efficacy . Hypothesis # 1 : Children experimental group expose CPAT intervention show great improvement pre- post-intervention neuropsychological test compare child control group . Hypothesis # 2 : Children experimental group expose CPAT intervention show great improvement pre- post-intervention parent teacher behavioral rating ADHD behavior compare child control group . Hypothesis # 3 : Children experimental group expose CPAT intervention show great improvement pre- post-intervention academic outcome compare child control group .</brief_summary>
