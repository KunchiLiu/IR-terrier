	<brief_title>Dairy Proteins Postprandial Appetite Regulation Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study show high protein intake associate increased loss body weight body fat compare diet normal low protein content . The effect seem due high diet induce thermogenesis increase satiety . Milk high content protein . It contain two different type protein : whey casein . Whey soluble protein whereas casein clot stomach , delay gastric empty thus probably result slow release amino acid . It therefore likely two type protein affect thermogenesis appetite regulation differently . The aim present study examine effect dairy protein ( whey casein ) postprandial energy expenditure , substrate oxidation appetite regulation . The study cross-over design include four meal include test drink ( milk , casein drink , whey drink water ) .</detailed_description>
