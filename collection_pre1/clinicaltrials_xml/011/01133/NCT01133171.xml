	<detailed_description>Background : Personalized risk communication method use educate patient high risk develop cardiovascular event . These method include personalized counseling , print brochure individualize graph describe status risk factor . Very study provide interactive tool patient use compare relative change risk might result modify risk factor . Objectives : The goal pilot study : ( ) develop prototype personalize dynamic dashboard educate veteran help make informed decision modify vascular risk factor ( hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hyperlipidemia , tobacco use ) reduce probability vascular event ; ( b ) test usability tool patient 's perspective ; ( c ) provide preliminary data regard effectiveness tool term change lifestyle risk factor control compare nurse-education . Methods : This three-arm randomized control study . Veterans panel one experience general internist randomly assign one three group : ( 1 ) dashboard nurse-education , ( 2 ) nurse-education alone , ( 3 ) usual care . To eligible , patient must least two follow : body mass index &gt; 30 kg/m2 ; current tobacco use ; systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg diastolic &gt; 90 mm Hg ; LDL-cholesterol &gt; 130 mg/dL , hemoglobin Hb1Ac &gt; 8 % . We develop dashboard Human Computer Interface/Information Technology laboratory . Patients dashboard group receive two in-person counseling session regard method control risk factor , ask use dashboard tool enter value risk factor observe relative effect vary risk factor control overall vascular risk . The nurse-education consisted two in-person counseling session regard method control risk factor . Both intervention session last approximately 30 minute ; therefore , majority time use interact tool dashboard group whereas entire time use personalize risk factor discussion nurse-education group . For usual care group , data retrospectively collect primary care visit laboratory test take place period visit intervention patient . Status : Completed .</detailed_description>
