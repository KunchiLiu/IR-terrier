	<criteria>Age 1880 able give inform consent , likely able participate full 28 day study . Previously diagnose diabetes mellitus , require use insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agent glycemic control . The presence infection one foot ( define distal superiormost point lateral malleolus ) , drainage , abscess fluid collection culture , yet treat great 24 hour prior oral antibiotic therapy within last 48 hour , wand include either quinolone linezolid . The foot lesion , opinion initial treat physician , severe enough ( either lesion subject 's diabetic control , vasculopathy , etc ) require intravenous antibiotic . A culture wound , either time screen within 72 hour prior screen , yield Gram positive organism show sensitive ( likely sensitive ) vancomycin daptomycin . This include Staphylococcus aureus , ( include MSSA MRSA , exclude VRSA ) , Enterococcus faecalis enterococcus faecium ( exclude VRE ) , streptococci , include Groups A B , well betahemolytic streptococci , viridans streptococci , Group D. A culture coagulase negative staphylococci Gram positive isolate consider participation . Cultures may obtain swab fluid submit culture . Able read write English proficiency suitable complete pharmacoeconomic quality life questionnaires diary . No Gram positive bacteria identify infected foot , infection Gram positive organism resistant one two study drug , infection coagulase negative staphylococci Gram positive organism isolate . Known hypersensitivity either two propose study agent , ciprofloxacin , second antimicrobial agent necessary . Renal dysfunction , study subject require dialysis . The presence active osteomyelitis foot . The presence concomitant infection would require antibiotic therapy addition prescribe foot infection . The presence pneumonitis require antimicrobial therapy , regardless suspect etiologic organism . A history drug induce ototoxicity ( either auditory vestibular ) .
