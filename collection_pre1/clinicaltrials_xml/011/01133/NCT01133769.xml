	<brief_summary>About 90 % chest injury America due blunt force , mostly result motor vehicle collision fall . Severity varies minor bruise severe chest injury . For several year , clavicle ( `` collarbone '' ) fracture treat without surgery ( non-operatively ) , even fracture place ( displace ) . Over last year , however , treatment change towards surgical fixation ( operative ) , sometimes difficult heal clavicle fracture displace . Several research study show case clavicle fracture never heals completely ( non-union ) frequent nonoperative treatment , compare operative fixation . In case , surgery still require , later ( secondary surgery ) . Further , clavicle malunion , fracture heals still place ) show high nonoperative treatment . Recent publish research study show good function , high patient satisfaction , early return activity ( use arm ) decrease nonunion malunion follow surgery , also call open reduction/internal fixation . Despite recent publish research , still lack agreement surgical fixation perform clavicle fracture . Patients chest injury often clavicle fracture . Chest injury restrict patient ' ability breathe , cough , stand , walk leave hospital . Although unusual chest injury improve surgery , patient clavicle fracture chest injury might recover fast clavicle fracture repair . Patients ask take part study sustain clavicle fracture associate chest injury without injury abdomen , arm legs . The aim study determine difference hospital length stay , intensive care unit length stay , respiratory rehabilitation ( recovery good respiratory function ) , functional outcome , ability become mobile , complication risk die trauma patient chest injury clavicle fracture treat operatively versus non-operatively .</brief_summary>
