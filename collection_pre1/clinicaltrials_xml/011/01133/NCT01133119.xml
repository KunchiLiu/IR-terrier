	<brief_summary>In Cardiac Diagnostic Interventional Unit ( CDIU ) Hospital Sick Children ( SickKids ) , minimally invasive procedure perform diagnose treat variety congenital heart defect . Procedures perform general anesthetic involve insert catheter skin femoral vein artery groin . In addition , use local anesthetic pain control regimen prior removal femoral artery vein sheath use cardiac interventionalists . Local anesthetic infiltrate near sheath insertion site , end procedure child general anesthetic , goal decrease pain insertion site promote comfort post-operative period . The use local anesthetic depends choice individual practitioner currently routine practice patient . The investigator propose research seek investigate whether use subcutaneous bupivacaine reduces pain level post-operative period child cardiac catheterization procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Local Anesthetic ( 0.25 % Bupivacaine ) Pain Control Pediatric Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A number difference pediatric cardiac catheterization procedure exist limit transferability research finding adult literature . For example , majority pediatric cardiac catheterization perform general anesthetic , femoral sheath remove general anesthetic end procedure . In contrast adult clinical practice , procedure perform general anesthetic , femoral sheath remove patient awake often 4 6 hour end procedure . These difference limit ability apply research finding adult pediatrics , warrant study effect local anesthetic femoral site pain child . As well , study adult examine pain 20 minute sheath removal . We seek investigate impact bupivacaine 6 hour cardiac catheterization child .</detailed_description>
