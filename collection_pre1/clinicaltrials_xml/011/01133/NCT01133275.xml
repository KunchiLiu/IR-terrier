	<brief_summary>The purpose research evaluate use lenalidomide prednisone people Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) . Lenalidomide drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone people multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . As use study consider investigational use . An `` investigational use '' use test approved FDA . Prednisone approve FDA treat numerous condition . In addition , prednisone approve FDA treat Low Intermediate-1 IPSS Risk , non-del ( 5q ) MDS . `` Study drug '' refers combination lenalidomide prednisone .</brief_summary>
