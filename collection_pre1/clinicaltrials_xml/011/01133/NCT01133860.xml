	<brief_summary>The term MYH9-related disease ( MYH9RD ) include four genetic disorder : May-Hegglin anomaly , Sebastian syndrome , Fechtner syndrome , Epstein syndrome . All disorder derive mutation unique gene , name MYH9 , recognize different clinical presentation single illness name MYH9RD . All patient affect MYH9RD present since birth thrombocytopenia , result variable degree bleed diathesis ; subsequently develop additional clinical manifestation , renal damage , sensorineural hearing loss , and/or presenile cataract . Eltrombopag oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist stimulate proliferation differentiation megakaryocyte , bone marrow cell produce blood platelet . This drug effective increase platelet count healthy volunteer , well patient affect acquired thrombocytopenia , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura HCV relate thrombocytopenia . The purpose study determine eltrombopag , administer orally dose 50 75 mg/daily 6 week , effective increase platelet count patient affect MYH9RD . Further aim study test eltrombopag effective reduce bleeding tendency MYH9RD patient ; evaluate safety tolerability eltrombopag patient MYH9RD ; evaluate vitro function platelet produce therapy patient respond drug .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 16 year Confirmed diagnosis MYH9related disease Average platelet count previous year less 50x10e9/L Written inform consent Diseases know involve risk thromboembolic event ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) History thrombosis within 1 year Use drug affect platelet function ( include limit , aspirin , clopidogrel NSAIDS ) anticoagulants Females pregnant nursing ( negative pregnancy test require enrollment fertile woman ) Formal refusal recommendation safe contraception Alcohol drug addiction Altered renal function define creatinine 20 mg/L Any disease condition advise responsible physician would make treatment dangerous patient would make patient ineligible study , include physical , psychiatric , social behavioral problem . HCV positivity liver disease consider exclusion criterion since phase II study show eltrombopag effective safe patient population .</criteria>
