	<brief_summary>This study look good way define rectal tumor undergo pre-operative radiation . MRI scan generally result clear definition tumor CT scanning . Insertion radio opaque clip tumor site could also help visualize tumor well radiotherapy treatment planning . The investigator believe technique would help physician define cancer well use CT scan alone . The investigator also compare technique define good way define tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Compare Benefits Endoscopic Tumor Clip Placement 3T-MRI Simulation Accurate Target Volume Definition Rectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Pre-operative Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . The use endoscopically place mucosal metal clip define superior inferior extent rectal tumor improve accuracy tumor localization patient undergo non-contrast CT simulation . 2 . A 3T-MRI provide good localization rectal tumor pelvic node compare non-contrast CT simulation radiotherapy treatment planning . 3 . By compare two novel method standard procedure , would able define difference three method obtain estimate accuracy reliability method localization rectal tumor .</detailed_description>
