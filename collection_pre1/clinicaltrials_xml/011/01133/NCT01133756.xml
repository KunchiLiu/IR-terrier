	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended Phase II dose lenvatinib administer combination carboplatin gemcitabine ( Phase IB ) evaluate safety tolerability E7080 administer combination carboplatin gemcitabine compare carboplatin gemcitabine alone ( Phase II ) participants platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>E7080 Combination With Carboplatin + Gemcitabine Versus Carboplatin + Gemcitabine Alone Second Line Therapy Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer CA125</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , randomize study consist Phase 1b portion : safety run-in period 3 dos lenvatinib administer combination carboplatin + gemcitabine ; Phase II portion : randomize 2-arm period . Approximately 100 participant ovarian cancer enrol study ( 10 20 participant Phase 1b portion 80 participant Phase II portion ) . Participants participate either Phase 1b Phase II portion . Participants receive study treatment ( lenvatinib plus carboplatin + gemcitabine carboplatin + gemcitabine ) six 21-day cycle ( 18 week ) . Participants receive E7080 experience evidence clinical benefit ( CR , PR , SD ) may continue single agent E7080 beyond 18 week , occurrence progressive disease ( PD ) , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , withdrawal investigator , whichever occur first . Initially , ascend dose schedule start lenvatinib 16 mg daily Day 1 Day 21 chosen Phase 1b portion determine MTD lenvatinib administer daily combination carboplatin + gemcitabine ; however , due hematologic toxicity observe first cohort , lenvatinib administration schedule change Days 2 21 Protocol Amendment 2 . Continued hematologic toxicity prompt third protocol amendment , design evaluate lower range dos start lenvatinib 8 mg daily Protocol Amendment 3 . After three protocol amendment , recruitment Phase 1b portion study limit , one evaluable participant enrol last 5 month recruitment . Due limit enrollment despite significant diligence boost enrollment complex study design require manage hematologic toxicity , study terminate initiation Phase II . Safety assess monitor record adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) ; vital sign ; Gynecological Oncology Group performance status ; clinical laboratory evaluation ; physical examination ; 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) .</detailed_description>
