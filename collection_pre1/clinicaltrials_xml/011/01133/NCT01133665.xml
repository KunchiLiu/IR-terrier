	<brief_title>Cetuximab Lenalidomide Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To study specific FcRIIIa polymorphism correlation clinical outcome subject treat cetuximab lenalidomide . There evidence cetuximab CRC , trastuzumab breast cancer rituximab follicular lymphoma , FcRIIIa polymorphisms correlate clinical response antibody therapy clinical outcome . It hypothesis patient SCCHN clinical outcome cetuximab lenalidomide correlate patient FcRIIIa genotype . Secondary : To evaluate safety toxicity profile combination cetuximab lenalidomide give treat subject SCCHN . To study FcRIIIa polymorphisms correlation ability NK cell mediate ADCC SCCHN . It hypothesis NK cell patient advance SCCHN mediate ADCC SCCHN cell line presence cetuximab lenalidomide efficiency ADCC correlate FcRIIIa polymorphism . To evaluate ability NK cell induce ADCC expression specific activation marker NK cell surface . It hypothesis NK cell induce ADCC express specific activation marker predictive efficiency ADCC .</detailed_description>
