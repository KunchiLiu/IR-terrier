	<brief_summary>Several novel image technology currently use detection differentiation colonic polyp colonoscopy , NBI ( Olympus ) , FICE ( Fujinon ) , i-Scan ( Pentax ) . Several previous study indicate NBI without magnification useful real-time differentiation diminutive colonic neoplasia . To date , however , study compare NBI image system ( FICE i-Scan ) differentiation diminutive colonic polyp . The study objective compare diagnostic efficacy NBI i-Scan real-time prediction diminutive colonic polyp . In prospective pilot study , diminutive colonic polyp detect colonoscopy observe conventional colonoscopy , thereafter observe new image system . Sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic accuracy NBI i-Scan assess reference histological result obtain endoscopic biopsy polypectomy .</brief_summary>
