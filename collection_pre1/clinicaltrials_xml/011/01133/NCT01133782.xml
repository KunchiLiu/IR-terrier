	<brief_summary>Viral respiratory infection common worldwide . It suggest nucleic acid amplification test , enable rapid etiologic diagnosis , may useful reduce antibiotic prescription rate . The objective study evaluate access multiplex real-time PCR method would impact antibiotic prescription acute respiratory tract infection ( ARTIs ) , primary care . Adult patient respiratory tract infection prospectively include . Nasopharyngeal throat swab analyze multiplex real-time PCR method , target 13 virus two bacteria . Samples collect winter season ( October-April ) . Patients open-label randomised receive rapid result ( follow day ) delay result ( 10+/-2 day ) . The investigator plan include approximately 400 patient . Prescription antibiotic measure initial visit well follow-up visit 10+/-2 day later . Primary endpoint antibiotic prescription acute phase ( initial visit ) secondary endpoint antibiotic treatment ( ongoing initiate ) follow-up visit . The hypohesis access method ability provide rapid etiologic diagnosis respiratory infection affect use antibiotic outpatient care adult patient ARTI .</brief_summary>
