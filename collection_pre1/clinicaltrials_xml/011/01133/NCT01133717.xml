	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalent sleep breathing disorder general population recurrent collapse upper airway occur sleep . OSA prevalent subject stroke associated 3 fold increase risk stroke . This make serious public health problem . Approximately 50 % subject OSA asymptomatic often detect follow investigation cause heart disease stroke . In subject treat OSA many intolerant poorly compliant treatment . Therefore , identification subject OSA risk adverse consequence stroke important , treatment compliance improve . Therfore , investigator want determine compare subject without OSA , subject OSA evidence increase stroke risk assessment change cerebral blood flow ( cerebrovascular reactivity ) measure Doppler ultrasound middle cerebral artery ( TCD ) blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging pattern cerebral blood flow ( BOLD MRI ) two stimulus . These stimuli include increase carbon dioxide concentration ( cause increase cerebral blood flow ) reduce oxygen concentration ( cause decrease cerebral blood flow ) . In order deliver stimulus investigator use special machine ( RespiractTM ) allow precise control carbon dioxide oxygen concentration lung blood . The precise control carbon dioxide oxygen conjunction BOLD MRI enable production detail map brain identify area healthy abnormal blood supply .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSA associate increase risk cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease compare general population . The mechanism increase stroke risk OSA unknown . However , constellation adverse pathophysiological consequence , include intermittent hypoxia carbon-dioxide retention result OSA may detrimental CVR predispose brain ischemia . Previous study OSA subject measure CVR use TCD . Therefore , study examine CVR two method ( TCD BOLD-MRI ) reliable reproducible hypercapnia independent control oxygen saturation ( RespiractTM ) . Patterns see CVR may eventually allow identification OSA patient great risk stroke therefore , require aggressive risk reduction and/or treatment irrespective symptom .</detailed_description>
