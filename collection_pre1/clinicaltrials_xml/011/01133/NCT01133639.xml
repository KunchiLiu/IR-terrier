	<brief_summary>This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial accept eligible consecutive patient undergo elective Kalish bunionectomies . Patients randomize either receive ketorolac ( 30 mg IV dose intra-operatively followed 10 mg orally every 8 hour five day ) plus standard care placebo plus standard care . The purpose study evaluate effect ketorolac plus standard care post-operative pain control radiographic osseous healing . Patients assess pain via validated pain questionnaire delay union via radiographic score system show high inter- intra-observer reliability blind board certify radiologist . Additional outcomes bunionectomy procedure also evaluate include adverse event time regular shoe gear activity .</brief_summary>
