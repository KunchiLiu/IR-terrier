	<brief_summary>Glycocyamine ( guanidinoacetic acid - GAA ) biochemical precursor creatine , phosphorylated play important role high-energy carrier muscle . Since GAA administer liquid solution , sport drink , could hypothesise GAA could easily enhance creatine biosynthesis clear physiological effect yet determine . No single study examine influence GAA health , human performance body composition indicator healthy human subject . Moreover , effective dose GAA yet find . Finally , adverse effect GAA supplementation human determine . The main aim present study identify 6-weeks GAA supplementation improve human performance body composition , determine effective dose regimen GAA , analyze adverse effect GAA supplementation . Forty eight healthy , trained ( &gt; 2 yr train experience ) male female subject ( age 20 25 year ) give inform consent volunteer participate study , obtain approval University 's Ethical Advisory Commission . The subject allocate four randomly assign trial : ingesting GAA ( 1.2 , 2.4 , 4.8 g GAA single dose ) placebo ( PLA ) 6 week double-blind design . All test include blood urine sample , body composition muscle strength exercise performance ( aerobic anaerobic ) conduct presupplementation ( baseline ) , 1 week , 2 week , 4 week , 6 week supplementation 8 10 week ( 2 4 week end supplementation ) analyze wash-out period . According previous investigation , investigator expect ingestion GAA significantly increase serum creatine total homocystein . The investigator expect ingestion GAA significantly improve muscle strength parameter exercise performance result compare placebo long term . The investigator also expect find prevalence side-effects ( i.e . gastrointestinal distress , retention fluid ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For last two decade , top athlete first , sport professional amateur sport participant use oral creatine supplementation regular basis ergogenic aid improve performance ( Poortmans &amp; Francaux 2000 ) . Up 90 % team-game athlete regular consumer creatine ( Striegel et al . 2006 ) , nearly 60 % recreational athlete try creatine ( Froiland et al . 2004 ) . Supplementation oral creatine , currently view safe , augments skeletal muscle creatine concentration individual , show promote gain lean body mass use conjunction resistance training , enhance power strength , improve performance intense exercise , especially repeat bout ( Racette 2003 ; Ostojic 2004 ) . Yet , creatine stable solution offer variety non-liquid form include powder , tablet , gel , chew gum , candy ( Benzi &amp; Ceci 2001 ) . Although creatine synthesis proprietary process among manufacturer , quite common use another muscle-related compound ( i.e . sarcosine , cyanamide ) , principal start material commercial synthesis creatine ( Williams &amp; Branch 1998 ) . Glycocyamine ( guanidinoacetic acid - GAA ) along L-ornithine form arginine glycine kidney , reaction believe regulated step creatine biosynthesis ( Edison et al . 2007 ) . The second enzyme pathway GAA N-methyltransferaze catalyze transfer methyl group S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) GAA form S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) creatine ( Walker 1979 ) . It estimate 75 % labile methyl group use synthetize creatine reaction catalyze GAA N-methyltransferaze ( Mudd et al . 1975 ) . It seem creatine synthesis interorgan process whereby GAA , produce kindey , release circulation methylated creatine liver . Creatine release liver circulation take , via specific transporter , various tissue . According previous study animal ( da Silva et al . 2009 ) preliminary research human ( AlzChem 2009 ) , short-term oral intake GAA increase serum level creatine , level increase interrelate GAA dose supplement . GAA biochemical presursor creatine , phosphorylated play important role high-energy carrier muscle ( Edison et al . 2007 ) . Since GAA administred liquid solution , sport drink , could hypothesise GAA could easily enhance creatine biosynthesis clear physiological effect yet determine . Moreover , seem GAA significantly good bioavailability creatine , develop maximal activity dosage creatine lead observable effect ( AlzChem 2009 ) . Several human study ( Borsook &amp; Borsook 1951 ; Graybiel &amp; Patterson 1951 ; Higgins et al . 1952 ; Dixon et al . 1954 ) find beneficial effect creatine precursor oral administration cardiac decompensation , arthritis , anxiety depression patient . Authors speculate benefical effect GAA intake could due boost energy level and/or increase availability dimethylglycine incorporation tissue protein , provide repair damage muscle cell . Yet , single study examine influence additive-free GAA ( e.g . without betaine choline ) health , human performance body composition index . The amount take supplementation range typically grams ten gram per day week month previous research human . Although , effective dose yet find . Finally , adverse effect GAA supplementation animal human yet determine . Several study show moderate hyperhomocysteinemia ( Stead et al . 2001 ; Fukada et al . 2006 ; Setoue et al . 2008 ; AlzChem 2009 ) , disturbances antioxidant system ( Zugno et al . 2008 ) , modulation inflammatory response ( Glorieux et al . 2004 ) GAA supplementation . If GAA ergogenic property could become new effective performance-enhancing substance professional recreational athlete , stable water solution , creatine neutral slightly acidic pH-values rapidly metabolise creatinine , meaningless energy production ( AlzChem 2009 ) .</detailed_description>
