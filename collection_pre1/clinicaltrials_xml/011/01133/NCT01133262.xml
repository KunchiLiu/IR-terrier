	<brief_summary>We develop prototype PET insert device integrate clinical PET/computed tomography ( CT ) scanner improve image resolution approximately 2.5 mm 3 dimension within reduced imaging field view ( FOV ) . This zoom-in imaging capability provide 6-fold improvement volumetric image resolution current state-of-the-art clinical PET scanner , offer tremendous opportunity cancer image application , particular case lymph node involvement drastically alter patient management plan . Accurate diagnosis stag head-and-neck cancer know challenge complex anatomy large number lymph node involve region . As result , head neck cancer image ideal candidate evaluate clinical usefulness novel image device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Head Neck Cancer Detection Using Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Insert Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In project , propose conduct exploratory clinical trial investigate effectiveness novel image device detect small lesion lymph node involvement head neck region , compare result obtain clinical PET/CT scanner . More specifically , propose ( 1 ) recruit 5 patient confirm head neck cancer schedule receive whole-body PET/CT scan follow surgical operation remove primary tumor regional lymph node . These patient image state-of-the-art PET/CT scanner use standard whole-body PET/CT image protocol standard care initial staging . On another day , follow consent participate research protocol , A patient undergo image head neck region use type scanner without novel PET insert device attach ; ( 2 ) The image obtain PET insert device review experienced nuclear medicine physician identify extent lymph node involvement . The PET insert image compare standard clinical PET/CT image . A detailed image obtain purpose research , center level head neck , acquire approximately 3 time length time standard clinical image obtain also compare PET insert image . Images also compare pathology report surgically remove specimen . ( 3 ) Estimate performance lesion detection different size tumor use standard PET/CT scanner well PET insert device .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma head neck suspect lymph node metastasis . Subjects histological confirmation squamous cell carcinoma lymph node biopsy head neck region carcinoma unknown primary would also eligible . 2 . Patient must schedule receive ( already receive ) clinical whole body PET/CT scan Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner standard care stag . 3 . Patient must schedule receive surgical removal primary tumor regional lymph node . It prefer surgery occur within 21 day research PET imaging . 4 . Age &gt; 18 year , head neck cancer extremely rare child . 5 . Ability patient ( legally authorize representative applicable ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 6 . Not currently pregnant nursing : Female subject must either surgically sterile ( documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or document hysterectomy ) , post menopausal ( cessation menses 1 year ) . If childbearing potential , urine pregnancy test must perform within 24 hour period immediately prior administration 18FDG determine negative 1 . The subject weight limit 250 lb due size limitation prototype PET insert device . 2 . Subjects claustrophobic 3 . Subjects poorly control diabetes ( fast blood glucose &gt; 200mg/dL ) 4 . Subjects prior head/neck surgery radiation may disturb natural architecture tissue impede image analysis</criteria>
