	<brief_summary>Impaired activity Natural Killer ( NK ) cell propose mechanism contribute viral persistence Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) infection . NK cell display anti-fibrotic activity kill activate hepatic stellate cell ( HSCs ) lose self-recognition marker ; Major Histocompatibility ( MHC ) class I . Determining down-expressed gene NK cell necessary anti-fibrotic activity never study previously . This allow u study role fully phagocytosis process well interaction HSCs therefore manipulate gene use molecular technique . Exploring cellular function gene highlight involvement progression liver fibrosis could use therapeutic tool prevent disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lymphocyte/Hepatic stellate cell ( HSCs ) interaction via adhesion phagocytosis mediate well affect among others Leptin , Endocannabinoids ( CB ) receptor , adiponectin , progesterone well number CD8 NK related adhesion/phagocytosis candidate gene . Those pathway may explain impaired activity NK cell Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) cirrhotic case . In perspective , propose follow specific aim : 1 . To confirm repeat gene array pro/anti-fibrotic gene express NK CD8 lymphocyte-subsets human healthy volunteer patient HCV cirrhosis . Then explore issue lymphocyte gene array ( NK CD8 cell ) na√Øve carbon tetrachloride fibrosis model mouse . Then support result Real Time PCR conduct bio-informatics assessment result . 2 . Evaluate role Leptin , CB receptor adiponectin lymphocyte/HSCs phagocytosis process . This would test in-vitro in-vivo setting use cell culture knock-out mouse ( CB2-/- , Adiponectin-/- leptin-/-Ob/Ob ) . The use lymphocyte adoptive transfer model immune manipulation guide u specific functional role target gene specific lymphocyte subset . 3 . To evaluate lymphocyte/HSC phagocytosis process affect CD8 NK related gene candidate extrapolate result earlier aim ( see preliminary data ) . Suggested gene include : Immune synapse gene ( CHST13 NLGN4X ) obtain expected anti-fibrotic response . Genes HSCs phagocytotic activity provide possible pathway HCV relate escape expect anti-fibrotic response eventually pro- fibrotic consequence ( AIF1 , CHST13 , hnRPL ) . Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C , member 2 ( NKG2C ; CD159c ) express HCV relate CD8 cell suggest decrease HSCs kill CD8 cell . Progestin &amp; adipoQ receptor family member IV ( PAQR4 ) : Progesterone adipoQ receptor down-expressed HCV relate CD8 cell . Adiponectin anti-fibrogenic mediator candidate PAQR4 ligand . When PAQR4 receptor down- regulate CD8 cell , suggest would mechanism immune impairment . Also , Moreover , Progesterone adipoQ receptor down- expression support mouse animal model result pregnancy cause progression hepatic fibrogenesis associate increase CD8 subset NK-T cell . We go evaluate specific effect phagocytosis process . 4 . To evaluate HCV HCV related protein directly responsible NK related impairment . Transgenic mouse HCV envelop protein use assess alteration lymphocyte subset phagocytosis ability . The expected result extend knowledge hepatic fibrogenesis particular may provide application general immunology . Therefore , expect result potentially new target anti-fibrotic design possibly medical condition . Not liver cirrhosis potentially prevent follow anti-fibrotic therapy also hepatocellular carcinoma</detailed_description>
