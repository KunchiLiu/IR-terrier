	<brief_summary>PCOS common endocrine disorder reproductive woman . It estimate 5 10 % woman reproductive age PCOS . One major diagnostic criterion PCOS chronic anovulation lead irregular menstruation , amenorrhea , infertility ; diagnostic criterion hyperandrogenism lead hirsutism , acne alopecia . Furthermore , PCOS think metabolic disorder , long-term consequence PCOS diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease , potentially dangerous woman health . Early diagnosis prevention important PCOS patient . Obesity potential risk threat health population . There major impact obesity PCOS relate disorder . Insulin resistance distribution adipose tissue think important risk factor cardiovascular metabolic syndrome . To treat PCOS patient properly , Wan-Fang hospital establish specific medical team . The investigator recently publish `` Fertility Sterility '' clinical presentation androgen excess Taiwanese woman . Hirsutism much less prevalence Taiwanese PCOS woman previous report Western woman . It important know clinical presentation PCOS might ethic variance . Insulin resistance report another candidate might ethic variance.The investigator report 40 % woman PCOS woman obese , similar previous literature report .
