	<brief_title>Comparing Non-fixation Mesh Mesh Fixation Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hernia repair one common surgery perform world . The true India . With billion population , number hernia patient India perhaps run million . The laparoscopic repair increasingly become popular India . Decreased post operative pain less morbidity main advantage Total Extra Peritoneal Repair ( TEP ) open hernia repair . Laparoscopic hernia repair recommend method choice bilateral recurrent inguinal hernia . The disadvantage TEP requirement general anesthesia ( GA ) , need fix mesh , seroma formation difficult learn curve . Fixation mesh metal staple , apart increase cost , may lead new post operative groin pain even become chronic small percentage patient . This lead various study show non-fixation mesh safe , cost effective lead increase risk hernia recurrence compare conventional open hernia repair . Requirement GA TEP repair also several disadvantage compare regional anesthesia significant hemodynamic change , delayed recovery , post operative nausea vomiting , increase cost inability give anesthesia high cardio-pulmonary risk patient . Several study recent past demonstrate TEP feasible safe regional anesthesia ( epidural spinal ) well . We earlier report TEP repair could do without fixation mesh regional anesthesia . This study Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) compare outcome non-fixation mesh laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair fixation mesh spinal anesthesia . The end point measure would recurrence hernia pain post operative period .</detailed_description>
