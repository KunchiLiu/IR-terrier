	<brief_summary>Pulsed RadioFrequency ( PRF ) relatively new technique derive well establish prove intervention , thermal radiofrequency ( RF ) . Both procedure use treatment chronic pain . Unlike RF treatment , PRF direct damage nerve . During PRF treatment , electrical energy apply small needle affect nerve use pulsed time cycle delivers short burst RF current . This study interested look efficacy PRF chronic lumbar radicular pain ( CLR ) ass whether large scale clinical study method use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assess Effectiveness Pulse RadioFrequency Patients With Chronic Lumbar Radicular Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology Techniques : Patients would screen St Joseph-East End Pain Clinic Chronic Lumbar Radiculopathy ( CLR ) least 4 month duration . Based history clinical examination , diagnosis CLR involve one spinal segment make note . The patient consider eligible study CT MRI lumbar spine do within last 4 month demonstrate pathology concordant patient 's clinical symptom . The spinal level ( ) target treatment base clinical finding , e.g . patient exhibit sign symptom right L4 radiculopathy , MRI demonstrate right paracentral disc herniation L4-5 L5-S1 , L4 DRG target . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion fully explain nature study , intervention involve possible complication inform consent take . Enrolled patient would randomized-according method chosen include study accord previously randomize order . He/she also meet ASSESSOR ( blind intervention ) -who would note baseline parameter patient also collect baseline Oswestry Score chart , along note parameter . A patient bilateral radiculopathy treat affected side trial . A patient CLR one segment one side shall treat involved segment technique count single procedure intervention study . All OR ( operate room ) personnel , include physician perform intervention patient shall blind randomization treatment . The grouping code , hence actual treatment know person operate RF machine . Only RF technician shall view work detail RF machine noise machine cut . This ensure blind involve except RF technician . After check informed consent safety checklist , patient reveal belong group A B . All intervention do day care procedure OR . Patients would continue use medication . If pain relief obtain necessitates decrease usage medication shall record . Similarly unsatisfactory pain relief obtain necessitating increase dose change medication shall record . The parameter use statistical analysis collect mention data analysis paragraph . The patient establish IV access . He would put prone position . The involved area back would make sterile use chlorohexidine 2 % draped . The patient would connect continuous monitor 3 lead ECG , NIBP ( Non-Invasive Blood Pressure ) pulse oximetry . Sedation , use minimal ( Grade I II ) obtain necessary response patient . Under fluoroscopy guidance- particular spinal segment ( ) affect ( ) identify confirm . LA use 2 % lidocaine infiltrate skin entry site . For group RF needle ( Bayliss : 22-G needle , 5-mm curve active tip 10 cm ) use . With appropriate fluoroscopy view needle insert target location group . Target location : DRG enlargement form dorsal nerve root proximal junction spinal nerve lie within dural sleeve occupies upper , medial part intervertebral foramen ( 22 ) . It confirm anteroposterior fluoroscopy view advance , require , tip locate one-third halfway pedicle column ( 18 ) . Target Confirmation ( Malik et al ) : Appropriate fluoroscopic placement needle-near DRG lumbar area note ; anteroposterior x-ray projection , DRG describe lie immediately behind lateral aspect facet column spinal level lateral x-ray projection , localize dorsocranial quadrant IVF ( intervertebral foramen ) Proximity needle DRG determine appropriate sensory stimulation 50 Hz , 0.4 V ( avoids intraganglionic placement ) less equal 0.6 V ; motor stimulation 2 Hz threshold 1.5-2 time great sensory threshold avoid placement near anterior nerve root . A radiculogram do also confirm appropriate placement help recognise intradural placement needle . Both group respective DRG stimulate sensory confirmation . Treatment : Once position physician shall indicate RF technician `` treatment '' , time either PRF placebo ( continue sensory stimulation low frequency apply ) , without reveal . Application Intervention : In Group A-PRF ; PRF would apply 120 second 42 degree centigrade . Group B-placebo ; needle would continuously stimulate low voltage give sensation PRF application also obtain necessary noise blind patient . Only lidocaine 1 % 0.5 ml shall give group carry treatment . In group procedure do involved spinal segmental level . After procedure patient shift recovery area monitor , observe manage side effect . The observer , blind intervention , record pain score also check side effect observe patient discharge home . Blinding Bias control In study plan blind patient , treat physician assessor actual intervention do . The randomization code , hence actual treatment know administer person operate RF machine . The randomization conceal sealed envelope Blinding patient achieve : Randomization : Patients randomly allocate group use 1:1 ratio . The allocation block use block size 2 , 4 , 6 . Both intervention similarly , include use fluoroscopy . Both intervention do use kind needle technique stimulation . Patients belong placebo group continuous low voltage stimulation mask effect `` intervention '' . Blinding assessor achieve : Will know randomization order , Will present intervention , Will able access write dictate note regard intervention . Blinding treat Physician achieve : Will know randomization order group patient , Will reveal treatment apply . Duration treatment period Treatment intervention period involve approximately 30 min 60 min actual intervention do OR . Duration Frequency follow The duration follow 3 month intervention . The frequency follow follow , The patient would assess post-intervention follow day : 1 . 30 minute post-procedure recovery 2 . 24 hrs after-by phone call ( VAS side effect ) 3 . At 1 week post-procedure-Visit Observer ( VAS , ODI , medication , side effect ) 4 . At 4 week post-procedure-Visit Observer -assessment success ( VAS , ODI , medication , side effect ) . 5 . At 2 month post-procedure-Visit Observer ( VAS , ODI , medication , side effect ) 6 . At 3 month post -procedure-Visit Observer-last follow visit ( VAS , ODI , medication , side effect ) Sample Size , Recruitment Rate : Sample size determine base feasibility consideration . Total duration recruitment plan 8 month The propose target recruitment 8 month , expectation 4 patients/month , make total 32 patient study . Potential recruit patient , 4 patient every month calculate base TransForaminal Steroid Injections ( TFESI ) perform last 3-6 month also book next 3-6 month ( calculate monthly ) St Joseph 's Healthcare ; data obtain St Joseph 's Healthcare Department Anesthesia Pain Dept Secretary Office . TFESI represent well accept , presently perform intervention patient CLR patient suitable potential recruit study . Statistical Tests The Characteristics trial participant describe use mean ( standard deviation ) count appropriate . We use flow diagram summarize flow patient trial . Feasibility outcomes report count ( proportion ) . Duration The Trial The propose study would recruit patient 8 month compare expect estimation recruitment .</detailed_description>
