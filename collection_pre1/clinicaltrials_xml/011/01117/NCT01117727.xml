	<brief_summary>The purpose research develop tool help people paralyze . These tool call brain-computer interface ( BCIs ) . BCIs would allow person use brain signal operate technology . Specifically project 's goal design BCI operate switch .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensorimotor Rhythm Brain-Computer Interface Switch Operate Assistive Technology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator want make BCI use operate commercially available technology communication , environmental control computer access . The BCI would replace switch let people operate technology without move . However , investigator need people test BCI determine effective replacing switch .</detailed_description>
