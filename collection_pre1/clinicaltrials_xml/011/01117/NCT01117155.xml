	<brief_summary>Background : - Children brain tumor often magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan see tumor respond therapy see tumor grown . Sometimes , difficult tell scan abnormal tumor size shape , swell , scar tissue , dead tissue . Because brain tumor biopsy require surgery , researcher look noninvasive way evaluate brain tumor . - Positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan use radioactive sugar know 18F-FDG try determine tumor active . Active tumor generally take sugar surround tissue , normal brain tissue use sugar brain tumor , difficult tell tumor tissue take sugar . A different radioactive agent , 18F-FLT , studied adult different kind tumor . Researchers interested determine whether possible use agent marker tumor activity child . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness 18F-FLT pediatric glioma scan . - To compare result 18F-FLT study study use radioactive agent 18F-FDG 1H-MRSI . Eligibility : - Children le 18 year age radiation therapy treat malignant glioma . Design : - Participants scan test radiation therapy , 1 3 week radiation therapy , researcher suspect tumor growing . - This study involve three separate image test ( 1H-MRSI , 18F-FDG PET , 18F-FLT PET ) . - Proton spectroscopy ( 1H-MRSI ) procedure similar MRI perform scanner MRI . Because scan long ( 2-3 hour ) , child receive medication anesthesiologist sleep procedure . - Within 2 week 1H-MRSI scan , participant PET scan standard contrast agent ( 18F-FDG ) experimental agent ( 18F-FLT ) . These scan last approximately 1 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluating 18F-L-Thymidine ( FLT ) PET Imaging Children With Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - A limitation current investigational therapy patient brain tumor assessment response . - ( 18 ) F-FDG PET commonly use assess tumor metabolism . However , normal brain us glucose energy source , result increase background FDG uptake , confound result make difficult distinguish normal neoplastic activity . - Newer image technique noninvasively assess metabolic physiologic characteristic brain tumor tissue develop identify biomarkers clinical efficacy trial new molecularly target agent . - ( 18 ) F-fluorothymidine ( FLT ) PET radiopharmaceutical take proliferate cell may therefore serve surrogate marker early response lack response treatment . - This study prospectively evaluate ( 18 ) F-FLT child undergo radiation therapy glioma . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective : - Determine feasibility ( 18 ) F-FLT PET image pediatric patient malignant glioma - Determine ability ( 18 ) F-FLT PET image detect treatment change pediatric patient malignant gliomas undergo radiation therapy Secondary objective : - Determine safety toxicity profile PET image use ( 18 ) F-FLT pediatric patient malignant gliomas - To correlate change ( 18 ) F-FLT PET radiation outcome ( 12 month PFS ) - To compare performance ( 18 ) F-FLT-PET MR perfusion , proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-MRSI ) ( 18 ) F-FDG PET prediction tumor response , time progression overall survival time . ELIGIBILITY : - Children le 18 year age malignant glioma radiation therapy prescribed . - Adequate organ function define : - Hepatic : SGOT , SGPT le 5 time ULN ; total direct bilirubin less equal 2 time ULN - Renal : Serum creatinine must within upper limit normal value - Fasting serum glucose le 150 mg/dL - Negative serum urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential DESIGN : -Patients undergo MRI ( 1H-MRSI perfusion ) , ( 18 ) F-FLT PET ( 18 ) F-FDG PET within 2 week follow time point : pre-radiation therapy , 1-3 week post-radiation therapy , time suspect progression .</detailed_description>
