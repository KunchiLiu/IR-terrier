	<brief_summary>We look test novel device treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) . Rather use positive pressure open airway , test device delivers auditory tone affect neuromodulation . We test efficacy treat OSA minimize sleep disturbance . As device much less cumbersome wear , hope therapy device also improve compliance treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuromodulation Therapy Device Treatment Sleep Apnea Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common public health problem severe health consequence substantially raise risk cardiovascular cerebrovascular death . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) currently effective treatment option , yet half patient fail tolerate CPAP require approach . Novel treatment offer alternative CPAP thus sorely need suffering OSA . The Neuromodulation Therapy Device ( NMTD ) novel potential therapy OSA . The main goal project evaluate efficacy , tolerability , safety NMTD patient OSA . Hypothesis 1 - The NMTD device capable reduce AHI . OSA severity index apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , number apnea/hypopnea event occur hourly sleep . Our first aim determine NMTD 's operating characteristic treatment OSA . The optimal duration detect apnea/hypopnea event NMTD respond must first determine . Additional adjustable feature include sensitivity respiratory event sensor , well pulse duration , frequency , intensity deliver auditory tone . Since independent adjustment 4 parameter feasible , screen analysis test two variable time identify variable effectively reduce AHI . This allow practical titration therapeutic sleep study generalizable application device . Hypothesis 2 - Modified NMTD effective tolerable CPAP OSA treatment . Once Aim 1 complete effective NMTD setting identify , initiate Phase II NMTD trial ass efficacy tolerability . The primary outcome variable AHI reduction NMTD compare CPAP repeat polysomnogram ( PSG ) . We randomly assign previously titrate CPAP vs. NMTD subject compare resultant AHI two device . Tolerability also assess sleep efficiency , arousal index , sleep architecture . While auditory stimulus 90 dB threshold adversely affect sleep architecture quality,1 intermittent stimuli give different sleep stage previously assess . Therefore , monitor NMTD 's influence sleep architecture , arousal index , sleep efficiency compare variable CPAP use , allow u examine whether NMTD affect sleep quality . We also assess patient preference use CPAP versus NMTD . Hypothesis 3 - NMTD maintain efficacy repeat use . Given brain 's plasticity , unknown whether brain may adapt repeated auditory stimulus . Constant auditory stimulus may lead adaptation , result stimuli `` ignore . '' NMTD 's stimulus , however , less likely lead significant adaptation since intermittent somewhat random , dependent apneic hypopneic event . Subjects undergo two sequential night PSG NMTD evaluate stimulus-response extinction time . In future , device available , plan long-term evaluation . We propose test novel device treatment OSA . This device , successful , substantially expand treatment option OSA offer effective alternative CPAP potential improve treatment compliance . Plan : This prospective study evaluate efficacy NMTD treatment OSA . The study divide three consecutive phase , represent three aim . If eligible , participant assign phase currently study . - One PSG , use NMTD night ( 32 participant ) - One PSG , split NMTD standard CPAP therapy , randomize first ( 20 participant ) - Two consecutive PSGs use NMTD night ( 20 participant ) ass stimulus-response extinction time ( 20 participant ) All participant complete questionnaire experience device .</detailed_description>
