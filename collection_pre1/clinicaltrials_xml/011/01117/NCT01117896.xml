	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomized experimental trial determine whether quality healthcare provider/rescuer chest compression ( CC ) deteriorate rate pediatric model compare adult model . To determine relationship physiologic/metabolic marker work rescuer chest compression deterioration , determine effect stepstool use quality chest compression metabolic demand .

	<detailed_description>Context : Pediatric cardiac arrest result poor outcome . Effective chest compression improve survival patient . Unfortunately , compression generally inadequately perform quality compression give deteriorates rapidly time . Current American Heart Association ( AHA ) guideline call fast deep chest compression minimization interruption . The effect fatigue operational performance adhere strictly AHA guideline unknown . In addition , little pediatric data rescuer fatigue chest compression deterioration . Also , use stepstool may affect quality chest compression may also impact fatigue rescuer . Understanding biomechanics optimal chest compression performance may prove useful recommendation condition equipment execution effective chest compression cardiac arrest . We aim observe understand biomechanical quality allow effective compression . Objectives : 1 . To determine whether quality chest compression deteriorates rate pediatric model compare adult model . To determine relationship physiologic/metabolic marker work rescuer chest compression deterioration . 2 . To determine effect stepstool use quality chest compression metabolic demand . To determine whether quality chest compression deteriorates rate participant use stepstool compare use stepstool . Study Design/Setting/Participants : This prospective , randomized experimental trial perform Children 's Hospital Philadelphia . Participants healthcare practitioner routinely provide chest compression course work . Lay practitioner exclude . Study Measures : Participants ask perform continuous chest compression pediatric adult size manikin . Compression rate , depth , apply force well participant physiologic work efficiency anaerobic threshold record . To evaluate second objective , new cohort participant perform continuous chest compression adult size manikin without stepstool.. Compression rate , depth , apply force well participant physiologic work efficiency anaerobic threshold also record . Videotaping subject also use comparison subjective assessment chest compression quality objective chest compression quality data .</detailed_description>
