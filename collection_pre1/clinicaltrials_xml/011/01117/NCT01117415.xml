	<detailed_description>The enticement scarless surgery create unprecedented wave enthusiasm collaboration amongst surgeon , gastroenterologist , industry , lay public . However , major hurdle remain current minimally invasive practice ultimate goal safe , effective Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) . In ideal world , procedure incur equivalent ( less ) morbidity current laparoscopic approach offer benefit incisionless surgery . This idealism quickly temper potential create new devastate complication minimal potential benefit patient . Several critical question need answer . What probability complication ( ) accept ? How potential benefit NOTES weigh new complication ? What factor unique NOTES contribute cost effectiveness ? The propose study seek answer question occur . These result give clinician investigator necessary information compare outcomes NOTES potentially alter technique safer , effective intervention .</detailed_description>
