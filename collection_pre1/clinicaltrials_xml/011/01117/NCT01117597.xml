	<brief_title>Terrestrial Trunked Radio ( TETRA ) Cognitive Functions Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Several international study influence electromagnetic field mobile communication cognitive performance brain function wake sleep perform last year . No health relevant effect find maximum exposure 2 Watt per kilogram ( W/kg ) , applies use mobile device public . In Germany new digital radio communication network security authority organisation base TETRA standard set present . TETRA ( Terrestrial Trunked Radio ) use frequency band around 400 MHz much less investigated public mobile communication . The result German Mobile Telecommunication Research Programme show high temperature increase expose tissue 400 MHz frequency use mobile phone . For occupational group use mobile TETRA device ( example policeman fireman ) , local exposure 10 W/kg permit . Possible effect electromagnetic field mobile TETRA device investigate human reduce scientific uncertainty concern impact digital radio security authority . Objective In present study , possible effect exposure TETRA signal ( sham , SAR value 1.5 W/kg 6 W/kg ) brain activity human investigate . A volunteer study perform healthy young men , preferentially group potential user occupationally expose . Tests perform allow conclusion reaction speed accuracy , process acoustic visual information , ability concentrate , memory resilience . In parallel , wake EEG ( electroencephalogram , examination brain activity ) different condition ( rest , process test ) record evaluate . Furthermore , influence TETRA exposure sleep quality sleep EEG , well performance well follow day investigate . The result evaluate relation health relevance occupationally expose user . Volunteers For study participation , young male subject professionally engage TETRA age 18 - 30 year recruit , preferentially active night service , right hand non-smokers . 1 . Scientific knowledge In European country , security authority use TETRA radio network time . Similar Germany , European country actually set nationwide network . Some country accompany introduction TETRA standard scientific research . At begin present study , scientist Charité Berlin perform literature review health effect digital radio bring together data publication report various national scientific result . Overall much less data TETRA mobile communication . The result publish previously prove health effect TETRA.In one study slight influence memory find , could chance result large amount test perform . Therefore result verify . Literature study ( PDF , German , 398 kB , barrier-free ) 2 . Exposure setup In study , volunteer expose head region TETRA signal SAR value 1.5 Watt per kilogram 6 Watt per kilogram . A corresponding exposure setup construct characterised IMST GmbH ( Kamp Lintfort ) . It flat antenna worn leave side head simulate far possible exposure TETRA mobile device . It wear comfortably eight hour , even sleep . The true exposure individual brain region calculate detail Seibersdorf Laboratories GmbH . Description exposure setup ( PDF , German , 1,7 MB , barrier-free ) 3 . Perception warm An exposure SAR value 6 W/kg cause temperature increase head region almost 1 ° C use exposure setup describe . Since study perform blinded way ( neither volunteer directly involved scientist know actual exposure situation ) important prove volunteer able perceive warming . Therefore pilot study perform . It could show , volunteer able recognize actual temperature increase . Therefore , risk unblinding ( volunteer able discover specific exposure situation ) . Report pilot study ( PDF , 1,7 MB , German , barrier-free )</detailed_description>
