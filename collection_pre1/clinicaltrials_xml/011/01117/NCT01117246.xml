	<detailed_description>Bone third common site metastasis spread liver lung , great incidence breast , prostate , lung , kidney thyroid cancer . For example , 90 % patient die breast cancer patient advanced prostate cancer suffer bone metastasis , frequently responsible chronic pain lead increase morbidity mortality pathological fracture , compression syndrome hypercalcemia..Moreover , increase longevity patient cancer result improvement effectiveness treatment lead high incidence prevalence metastating bone lesion . Palliative treatment management pain improvement quality life remain first goal therapy . Current treatment option include systemic drug therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , analgesic bi-phosphonates ) , local invasive treatment ( surgery ) , local mini-invasive treatment interventional radiological technique ( cimentoplasty , cryotherapy radiofrequency ablation ) radiation therapy . External-beam radiation therapy remain current standard care patient bone metastasis first intention . However , 20-30 % patient treat experience pain relief recurrence pain appear 27 % treatment . Moreover radiation treatment limit due accumulation dose . Since year , cryotherapy percutaneous radiofrequency ablation show good result management pain bone metastasis , however technique still invasive . In MRI-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) , ultrasound generate transducer focus small focal tissue volume specific target location . During treatment , beam focus ultrasound energy penetrates soft tissue cause localized temperature elevation 55-70°C second within target produce well define region irreversible protein denaturation , cell damage , coagulative necrosis . A single exposure focus ultrasound energy call `` sonication . '' Multiple sonications necessary ablate target tissue . Tight focus design limit ablation target location . Applying HIFU energy patient 's lesion require treatment planning , target ultrasound ( US ) beam desire location monitor energy delivery . In application perform use diagnostic ultrasound image combination HIFU . While diagnostic US provide anatomical detail help procedure planning treatment target , provide 3D planning , mean measuring temperature increase generate HIFU , metric quantify energy/dose deliver treatment zone . Currently , MR image provide validate non-invasive temperature measurement thermal dose quantification treat tissue . Furthermore , real-time MR temperature measurement use control HIFU system deliver optimal temperature target location . The Philips MR-guided focus ultrasound system provide real-time tissue temperature map multiple plane control temperature deliver dose target location . Recent advance MR temperature map make possible achieve temperature accuracy 1°C stationary soft tissue .</detailed_description>
