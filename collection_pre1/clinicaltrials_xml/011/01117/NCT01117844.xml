	<brief_summary>This Feasibility/Phase II study patient diagnosis WHO Grade I - III Meningioma &amp; Hemangiopericytoma brain cancer give standard dose Proton radiotherapy . The study perform two phase : first , feasibility enrollment 12 patient Phase Page 8 20 II , enrollment additional 38 patient . All patient also give quality life ( QOL ) instrument pretreatment , weekly treatment , q 3 month year 1 post treatment , q6 month year 2 &amp; 3 yearly year 4 &amp; 5 . Comparisons make enrolled subject receive proton therapy know literature photon radiation . See section 2 full objective . The second phase begin early 60 day last patient initial phase complete treatment safety feasibility verify . The secondary objective serve objective second phase study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton Radiation For Meningiomas Hemangiopericytomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : The primary objective study feasibility safety . The study deem infeasible great 10 % pt experience one following : - Patient give treatment anatomy dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan devise . ( 95 % target volume cover 95 % dose ) - Patient unable tolerate 20 % treatment ( reason unable set patient within acceptable limit tolerance , patient unable tolerate treatment position immobilization duration treatment ) use proton radiotherapy ( 80 % treatment could deliver use photon ) . - Patient unable complete his/her treatment within 7 day estimate date treatment completion require treatment break great 5 day . Toxicity deem unacceptable great 20 % patient experience acute toxicity , define Section 7.12 . Secondary Objectives : - To assess acute side effect irradiation use proton beam therapy place conventional photon beam therapy treatment meningioma . - To assess quality life outcome , focus rate severe fatigue 6 12 month end treatment . - To assess late complication irradiation use proton beam therapy place conventional photon beam therapy treatment meningioma . - To compare dose distribution tumor surround normal structure use DVHs ( Dose Volume Histograms ) generate proton plan use treat patient photon plan generate comparison purpose . - To determine 1-yr local control progression-free overall survival use proton radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
