	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray type radiation kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy , intensity-modulated radiation therapy , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study intensity-modulated external beam radiation therapy treat patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated External Beam Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate patient safely receive IMRT teletherapy use propose IMRT fractionation schedule without experience treatment limit toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess treatment efficacy surrogate measure PSA nadir biochemical failure-free survival . OUTLINE : Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity modulate radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients intermediate- high-risk disease may also receive concurrent adjuvant long-term androgen deprivation therapy 36 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , every 4 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually year 5 .</detailed_description>
