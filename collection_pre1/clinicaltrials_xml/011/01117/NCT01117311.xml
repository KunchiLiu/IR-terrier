	<brief_title>Vagal Nerve Stimulation Glucose Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall aim application determine mechanism ( ) common bariatric surgical procedure alter carbohydrate metabolism . Very often , resolution diabetes occur early post-operative period prior development significant weight loss . It suggest bariatric surgery alters insulin action study examine insulin secretion postprandial glucose fluxes patient . At present time , little know various bariatric surgical procedure alter glucose homeostasis . It essential effect bariatric surgery meal size parameter understand accurately measure . Enteroendocrine secretion affect rate intestinal delivery calorie may also modulate enteric nervous system rate direct delivery nutrient enteroendocrine cell . Direct measurement intestinal transit also important part understand bariatric surgery alters intestinal secretion hormone may alter glucose metabolism . The Oral C-peptide Minimal Models apply C-peptide , glucose insulin concentration ingestion standard label mixed meal accurately measure insulin secretion action . Subsequently , disposition index provide measurement appropriateness insulin secretion prevail insulin action . When couple establish triple-tracer methodology , mixed meal use measure fast postprandial glucose flux . Though vagal trunk preserve bariatric surgery , gastric transection formation gastric pouch Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , sleeve gastrectomy duodenal switch procedure , may denervate post-gastric organ include pancreas intestine . Reversible vagal block result weight loss , decrease caloric intake , early satiation reduce hunger . The effect form vagal denervation glycemic control unclear . There evidence hepatic parasympathetic input regulates insulin action rodent . Vagal afferent also important hepatoportal glucose sensing . Subjects enrol study would stable Vagal Nerve Stimulation Blocker ( VNB ) intervention excess 12 month , take part prior observational study examine long-term effect vagal inhibition . All subject study three time use mixed meal . Participants admit Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Unit 17.00 hour even study . Following ingestion standardize low calorie mixed meal ( 400 Kcal : 55 % carbohydrate , 30 % fat , 15 % protein ) subject fast overnight . During experiment subject undergo mixed meal study outline ( Lead-in Mixed Meal 1 ) . On day study , subject randomize one 2 intervention : either discontinue use VNB continue use . Subjects restudied ( Mixed Meal 2 ) day admission Clinical Research Unit 17.00 hour 13th day randomization . To determine metabolic effect , , start VNB therapy , day study , VNB use resume discontinue depend prior activation inactivation . Subjects restudied ( Mixed Meal 3 ) day admission Clinical Research Unit 17.00 hour 13th day completion Mixed Meal 2 . Following completion study , VNB use resume subject .</detailed_description>
