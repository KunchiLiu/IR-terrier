	<brief_summary>About half lung cancer catch spread nearby lymph node . Lymph node small gland find throughout body remove bacteria foreign particle ( part immune system ) . A biopsy ( tissue sample ) send sent laboratory test . Biopsy result determine cancer spread ( metastasis ) determine best treatment patient lung cancer . The purpose study develop good way detect lung cancer earlier spread . This study compare traditional mediastinoscopy/thoracoscopy surgery newer combine Endobronchial Ultrasound ( EBUS ) Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) see either well purpose . Traditional medical practice surgically open chest biopsy suspicious lymph node ( call mediastinoscopy/thoracoscopy ) . Some medical center already start combine use EUS plus EBUS standard practice perform needle biopsy lymph nod chest stage treat lung cancer . Volunteers study diagnose know suspected lung cancer , receive one two choice determine cancer spread : 1 . Traditional Surgical Mediastinoscopy/Thoracoscopy Mediastinoscopy surgical procedure allow physician view area chest ( include heart , vessel , lymph node , trachea , esophagus , thymus ) . An endotracheal ( within trachea ) tube insert follow small incision ( cut ) chest . A mediastinoscope insert incision see organ inside mediastinum collect tissue sample . Mediastinoscopy use detect stage cancer . Thoracoscopy surgical procedure involve insertion thorascope small incision chest wall . A thorascope thin , tube-like instrument light lens usually tool remove tissue . This make possible examine lung structure chest cavity , without make large incision . 2 . EBUS combine EUS-guided FNA EUS involve use special endoscope fit ultrasound processor tip . During EUS , image surround lymph node obtain small needle guide esophagus suspicious node biopsy lymph node chest . Other research study show use EUS guide needle biopsy lymph node chest equally accurate surgical biopsy . However , use EUS needle biopsy limit see physician also limit sample lymph node front trachea . EBUS involve use small ultrasound scope pass open trachea airway . EBUS combine EUS less invasive procedure provide full view lymph node chest area .</brief_summary>
