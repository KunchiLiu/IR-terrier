	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To demonstrate superiority insulin glargine liraglutide term percentage patient reach Glycosylated Haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) &lt; 7 % end comparative period ( 24 week ) Type 2 diabetic patient fail lifestyle management oral agent Secondary objective comparative period ( 24 week ) : &gt; To assess effect insulin glargine comparison liraglutide : - HbA1c level - Percentage patient whose HbA1c decrease remain &gt; = 7 % end comparative period - Percentage patient whose HbA1c increase end comparative period - Fasting Plasma Glucose ( FPG ) - 7-point Plasma Glucose ( PG ) profile - Hypoglycemia occurrence - Body weight - Adverse event Objectives extension period ( 24 week ) : &gt; To assess effect insulin glargine patient adequately control liraglutide : - HbA1c level - FPG - 7-point PG profile - Hypoglycemia occurrence - Body weight - Adverse event</brief_summary>
