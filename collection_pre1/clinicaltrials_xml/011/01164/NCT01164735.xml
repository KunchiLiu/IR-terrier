	<brief_title>Biomarkers Tumor Tissue Samples From Patients With Stage III , Stage IV , Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency topoisomerase 2-alpha ( TOPO2A ) gene copy number alteration ( include deletion , gain , amplification ) , immunohistochemical expression , chromosome 17 polysomy tumor tissue sample patient advanced recurrent endometrial carcinoma treat anthracycline-based therapy Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) -0177 . II . To assess relationship TOPO2A gene copy number alteration , TOPO2A protein expression , chromosome 17 polysomy , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status tumor tissue sample patient . III . To assess association TOPO2A status ( TOPO2A gene copy number alteration TOPO2A protein expression ) , chromosome 17 polysomy clinical covariates ( e.g. , age , race/ethnicity , cell type , histologic grade , disease stage , regimen type ) . IV . To assess association TOPO2A status chromosome 17 polysomy measure clinical outcome include response , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . V. To evaluate potential identification cut point TOPO2A protein expression potential prognostic value patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Archived tumor tissue sample analyze topoisomerase 2-alpha gene alteration expression chromosome 17 polysomy fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Clinical information associate endometrial carcinoma sample ( e.g. , age , race/ethnicity , cell type , histologic grade , disease stage , regimen type ) also collect .</detailed_description>
