	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate maximum-tolerated dose and/or recommend phase II dose oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424 administer continuously , twice daily pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor . - To define describe toxicity treatment administer schedule pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor , leukemia , myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPNs ) . - To characterize pharmacokinetics treatment pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor , leukemia , MPNs . Secondary - To preliminarily define antitumor activity treatment within confines phase I study . - To assess biologic activity oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424 upon JAK-STAT signal pediatric patient relapse refractory solid tumor , leukemia , MPNs . - To assess cytotoxicity biologic activity oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424 upon phosphosignaling mutation burden pediatric patient whose leukemias MPNs know CRLF2 and/or JAK mutation . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral JAK inhibitor INCB18424 twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients relapse refractory leukemia may receive intrathecal chemotherapy course 2 subsequent course discretion treat physician . Plasma , bone marrow , blood sample may collect baseline , course 1 , subsequent course pharmacokinetic analysis correlative biology study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
