	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoembolization kill tumor cell block blood flow tumor keep anticancer drug near tumor . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether chemoembolization effective without sunitinib malate treat patient liver cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II/III trial study side effect chemoembolization liver see well work give together without sunitinib malate treat patient liver cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoembolization Liver With Without Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate unacceptable bleed hepatic failure 10 week post-treatment patient unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma treat transarterial chemoembolization combination sunitinib malate versus transarterial chemoembolization alone . - To evaluate overall survival patient . Secondary - To evaluate tumor stabilization rate patient . - To evaluate safety regimen patient . - To evaluate disease-free survival patient . - To evaluate relapse-free survival patient . - To evaluate quality life patient . - To evaluate overall survival rate 2 year patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Pilot : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Beginning 7-10 day later , patient undergo 1-3 course transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) . Treatment repeat every 6 week 1 year . Randomization : Patients stratify accord main tumor diameter ( &lt; 5 cm v ≥ 5 cm ) , nodular involvement ( uninodular v multinodular ) , center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive sunitinib malate TACE pilot phase . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily day 1-28 TACE pilot phase . Quality life assess periodically .</detailed_description>
