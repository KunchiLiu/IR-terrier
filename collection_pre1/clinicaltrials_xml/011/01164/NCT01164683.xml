	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) highly prevalent condition veteran estimate high 47 % . Poor adherence primary treatment OSA -- continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy - associate increased risk heart attack , stroke even death . The investigator plan improve CPAP adherence veteran interaction peer successfully adopt CPAP therapy . Such `` peer-buddies '' may promote well-being veteran remain highly cost-effective compare healthcare provider . Our strategy ground rationale veteran group ecoculturally homogenous expect give level difference age , gender , ethnicity , socioeconomic stratum . Our long-term objective initiate large , multi-site , research study enhance CPAP adherence veteran OSA . The ultimate goal research develop cheap , effective exportable system care promote CPAP adherence patient OSA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study CPAP Adherence Promotion Peer Buddies With Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project background : Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalent condition frequently treat continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy . Non-adherence therapy , however , afflict high proportion adult sleep apnea ( 46-83 % ) . Moreover , non-adherence CPAP associate increase risk fatal non-fatal cardiovascular event . There remain paucity reliable cost-effective intervention could promote CPAP adherence . Promoting adherence therapy peer-driven intervention cheap meet modest success chronic condition HIV , heart failure diabetes mellitus . Whether peer-driven ( `` buddy '' ) system improve adherence CPAP therapy unknown . Project Objectives : Our overall aim ass feasibility acceptability CPAP adherence program drive train `` peer-buddies '' sleep apnea . Specific Objective # 1 : To evaluate patient rating acceptability peer buddy system ( PBS ) veterans receive CPAP therapy OSA . Specific Objective # 2 : To obtain preliminary data effectiveness PBS sleep-specific HR-QOL ( Functional outcomes sleep questionnaire [ FOSQ ] ) veterans receive CPAP therapy OSA . Specific Objective # 3 : To obtain preliminary data effect PBS CPAP adherence , vigilance , patient activation , self-efficacy veteran receive CPAP therapy OSA . Project Methods : In order address aim , recruit recently diagnose patient OSA initiate CPAP therapy randomly assign peer-buddy system promote adherence CPAP therapy ( intervention group ) assign usual care ( control group ) . In PBS intervention group , train peer sleep apnea pair newly diagnose patient 3- month period . During time train peer share experience cop strategy CPAP device equipment ( promote self efficacy ) , share positive experience ( motivational effect outcome expectancy ) , share knowledge perceive vulnerability due untreated sleep apnea ( promote risk perception ) , share method improve efficacy CPAP equipment interface ( patient education ) prepare subject upcoming physician respiratory therapist appointment ( patient activation ) . The interaction occur supervise `` in-person '' session telephonic conversation 3-month period . Subjects group reassess end 3 month order determine objective measure CPAP adherence , sleep-specific HRQOL Functional outcomes sleep questionnaire [ FOSQ ] ) , vigilance ( psychomotor vigilance test ) , measure self-efficacy ( outcome expectancy , treatment self-efficacy , risk perception [ SEMSA questionnaire ] ) patient activation ( Patient Activation Measure [ PAM ] ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( define Apneahypopnea index [ AHI ] &gt; 5 per hour ; hypopnea define great 30 % reduction airflow 4 great drop oxygen saturation ) . AHI determine full night splitnight polysomnography . 2 . Age range 21 85 year old . 3 . Stable medical history change medication , include antihypertensive thyroid replacement , previous 4 month . 4 . No regular use ( &gt; 3 times/week ) sedative hypnotic medication last 4 month . 1 . Central sleep apnea ( central apnea index &gt; 5 per hour &gt; 50 % Apneahypopnea index constitute central apnea nonobstructive hypopnea ) . 2 . Complex sleep apnea CPAP emergent central apnea ( Central apnea index &gt; 5 per hour CPAP titration &gt; 50 % Apneahypopnea index constitute central apnea nonobstructive hypopnea ) . 3 . Requiring oxygen bilevel positive airway pressure treatment OSA hypoventilation . 4 . Decompensated cardiac ( heart failure angina ) pulmonary ( severe COPD uncontrolled asthma ) disease 5 . Chronic narcotic use 6 . Nasal obstruction ( nasal congestion score &gt; 15 ) enlarge tonsil 7 . Diagnosis another sleep disorder addition OSA base PSG ( e.g. , periodic limb movement disorder [ 15 limb movements/hour sleep arousal ] , central sleep apnea [ 50 % apneas diagnostic PSG central apnea ] , insomnia , obesity hypoventilation syndrome , narcolepsy ) . 8 . Previous treatment positive airway pressure , home oxygen therapy , tracheotomy , uvulopalatopharyngoplasty , surgery OSA . 9 . Night shift worker situation occupation regularly experience jet lag , irregular work schedule history last 6 month . 10 . Routine consumption 2 alcoholic beverage per day . 11 . Recent recur history recreational drug use lead tolerance dependence . 12 . Unable perform test due inability communicate verbally , inability write read English ; le 5th grade read level ; visual , hear cognitive impairment ( e.g . previous head injury ) ; upper extremity motor deficit ( e.g. , previous stroke prevents patient use CPAP treatment ) .</criteria>
