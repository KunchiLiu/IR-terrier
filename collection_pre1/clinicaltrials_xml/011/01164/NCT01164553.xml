	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate possibility give increase dose flu vaccine child 6 35 month age improve protection influenza without increase side effect . Investigators evaluate body 's response vaccine . Male female participant ' age 6-35 month , never receive flu vaccine , age 12-35 month , previously vaccinate , participate study 7 month . Vaccine naïve study participant receive two dos flu vaccine , either 0.25 mL dose ( Group 1 ) 0.5 mL dose ( Group 2 ) . Previously vaccinate subject receive one dose flu vaccine , either 0.25 mL dose ( Group 1 ) 0.5 mL dose ( Group 2 ) . Study procedure include physical examination , memory aid , blood sample follow-up phone call 6 month last vaccine dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza important cause morbidity mortality among child adult . Influenza A and/or B viruses cause yearly epidemic United States average 36,000 death 114,000 hospitalization annually . Children high rate infection . Influenza also associate substantial number hospitalization among young infant . Because limited data available variability report seroresponses dose 0.25 ml child 6-35 month age , investigator hypothesize high dose consistently immunogenic . In addition , since currently license trivalent inactivate influenza ( TIV ) vaccine well tolerate minimal systemic local adverse event , investigator hypothesize administer high dose 0.5 ml age group well-tolerated . Therefore , investigator propose compare safety immunogenicity 0.25 ml dos TIV 0.5 ml dos TIV administer child 6-35 month age . The propose study phase I , two-arm , 1:2 randomize , double-blinded trial compare safety immunogenicity increase dose ( ) ( 0.5 ml ) standard dose ( 0.25 ml ) TIV child 6-35 month age without history previous TIV vaccination . The population include Naïve Cohort : 270 healthy male female child 6-35 month age never receive influenza vaccination ; Fully Primed Cohort : 60 healthy male female child 12-35 month age receive two dos 2009-2010 H1N1 two dos TIV anytime past defined purpose study . Either standard pediatric dose ( 0.25 ml ) large dose ( 0.5 ml ) TIV administer intramuscularly anterolateral thigh 25 gauge 1 '' needle . The primary objective evaluate safety administer increase dose ( ) ( 0.5 ml ) TIV child 6-35 month age compare standard dose ( ) ( 0.25 ml ) TIV . The secondary objective compare humoral immune response TIV antigens child 6-35 month age receive increase dose ( ) TIV receive standard dose ( ) TIV .</detailed_description>
