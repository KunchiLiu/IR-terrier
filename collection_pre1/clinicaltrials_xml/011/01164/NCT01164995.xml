	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine patient p53 mutate epithelial ovarian cancer treat first line treatment ( paclitaxel - carboplatin combination therapy ) show early relapse ( within 3 month ) progression treatment benefit treatment Wee-1 inhibitor MK-1775 carboplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study With Wee-1 Inhibitor MK-1775 Carboplatin Treat p53 Mutated Refractory Resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platinum-based drug use first line treatment epithelial ovarian cancer . Despite high overall initial response rate , resistance early relapse occur . MK-1775 potent selective inhibitor Wee-1 kinase , kinase regulate G2/M checkpoint . Since human cancer retain p53-related G1 checkpoint abnormality , dependent G2 checkpoint . Annulment G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53 deficient tumor cell susceptible anti-cancer agent . The Phase I study MK-1775 combined gemcitabine , carboplatin cisplatin patient advance solid tumor already confirm target engagement MK-1775 . In study Carboplatin administer combination MK-1775 21 day cycle . Ovarian cancer patient p53 mutation base PCR/sequencing eligible study . p53 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) wil also perform . This study proof concept ( POC ) study . To proof hypothesis MK-1775 effective tumor harbor p53 mutation single stage study 21 patient perform . The final conclusion make follow : Applying A'Hern 's Single Stage Phase II Design , minimum 6 response ( RECIST 1.0 CA125 ) 21 patient provide 61 % power declare efficacy least 30 % ( α=0.05 ) . A response 13 % less would definitively indicate efficacy interest . Patients remain treatment longer clinical benefit treatment toxicity lead patient withdrawal . Patients follow least 30 day follow last dose study therapy , death , whichever come first . For patient stable disease follow-up take place least disease progression document = time progression . Patients discontinue study unacceptable adverse experience follow time progression resolution stabilization adverse experience . These patient stable disease end treatment discontinue unacceptable adverse experience evaluate every 2 month outpatient department , CA-125 determine . In case CA-125 increase CT scan perform . In patient CA-125 good marker , CT-scan need perform every 2 cycle ( 42 day ) , disease progression .</detailed_description>
