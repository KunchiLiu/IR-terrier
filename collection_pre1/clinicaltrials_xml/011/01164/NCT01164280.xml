	<brief_summary>Objectives : To evaluate effect pulse rate change clinical response stimulation relate pain symptom sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) treatment . Materials Methods : This pilot study evaluate effect 4 different pulse rate ( 5.2Hz-10Hz-21Hz-40Hz ) patient suboptimal response SNM . The effect frequency evaluate test period 6 day . To avoid carry effect , stimulation keep 24 hour consecutive test period . The last 3 day every test period , void diary ( VD ) questionnaire fill . The change clinical response pain symptom compare four pulse-rates use multivariate analysis . Results : Fifty patient include 40 ( 80 % ) female . Mean age 55.5yr ( SD 12.3 ) . Forty-one patient ( 82 % ) overactive bladder symptom 9 ( 18 % ) chronic non-obstructive urinary retention . No significant difference find regard clinical outcome ( VD questionnaire ) different pulse rate . Furthermore , none four pulse rate significantly relate occurrence SNM-related pain . However , individual basis , patient appear benefit change pulse rate concern treatment efficacy stimulation relate pain . Conclusions : On group level , none four pulse rate study appear significantly different effect clinical outcome SNM-related pain . However , tailor-made approach optimize treatment efficacy change pulse rate might useful .</brief_summary>
