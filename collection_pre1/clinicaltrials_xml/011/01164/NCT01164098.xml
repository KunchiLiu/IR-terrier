	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study novel target rituximab podocytes , particular focus recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . The propose study strong clinical implication , since may extend approve indication rituximab treatment recurrent FSGS well proteinuric disease . Furthermore , offer new insight role sphyngomyelin relate enzymes podocyte function health disease , thus allow identification novel target antiproteinuric drug development . Finally , propose study offer opportunity identify correlation patient 's specific clinical outcome experimental result obtain expose podocytes patient serum presence absence rituximab . Therefore , may lead development assay pre-transplant identification patient high-risk recurrent disease , among , may allow identification patient respond rituximab .</brief_summary>
