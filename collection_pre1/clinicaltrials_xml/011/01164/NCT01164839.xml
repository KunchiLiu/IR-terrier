	<brief_title>Evaluation Factors Affecting Diagnostic Performance Coronary Computed Tomography Angiogram ( CTA ) With Multi-slice Computed Tomography ( MSCT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Prospectively evaluate factor affect diagnostic accuracy coronary CTA multi-slice CT ( include 64-slice CT dual-source CT ) detect coronary stenosis , comparison quantitative X-ray coronary angiography , establish standard image quality associate parameter ensure accurate diagnosis coronary stenosis coronary CTA . Detailed Description Over past year , development CT technology , especially introduction 64-slice multi-slice CT ( 64 MSCT ) , permit application coronary CT angiography detect coronary stenosis suspect patient coronary heart disease . Now , coronary CT angiography widely use worldwide . However , accuracy coronary CT angiography always concern decision make proper treatment , especially determine existence significant stenosis patient visible coronary arteriosclerosis . Factors affect diagnostic accuracy may include spatial resolution , temporal resolution , motion artifact , band artifact , image noise level , calcification , vessel enhancement , operator dependant factor , etc . One factor may affect diagnosis performance single case . So important determine weight factor stenosis detection tolerance diagnostic accuracy adverse factor . Materials methods 1 . Patient Population : About one thousand patient recruit one year institution hospital . All patient undergo coronary CTA suspect coronary artery disease . Then X-ray coronary angiography perform base impression CTA find one radiologist ( participate study ) and/or clinical suspicion . Cases coronary CTA X-ray coronary angiography two week include . Our Institutional Review Board approve study . All patient give informed consent . Patients acute heart failure , severe arrhythmia severe renal dysfunction exclude cardiac study . 2 . To identify stenosis , coronary artery case divide 15 segment evaluation coronary CTA SCA . Coronary stenosis record percentage narrow lumen diameter degree stenosis ( without stenosis , mild stenosis ( â‰¦50 % ) , moderate stenosis ( 51 % ~75 % ) , severe stenosis ( 100 % ) ) . Experienced radiologist cardiologist make assessment independently double blind manner . The result SCA use gold standard . 3 . The process coronary CTA examination recruit case carefully record evaluate factor may affect diagnostic performance coronary CTA , heart rate , contrast injection parameter , delay time , optimal phase reconstruction , etc . In addition , image quality evaluate , include grade motion artifact , band artifact , enhancement , etc . 4 . To evaluate operator dependant factor , reformation coronary CTA perform two different operator . The reformed image also review two different observer evaluate stenosis , well image quality factor ( motion artifact , band artifact , image noise level , calcification burden , vessel enhancement ) . 5 . Statistical analysis perform evaluate weight different factor affect accuracy coronary CTA .</detailed_description>
