	<brief_title>Feasibility Limitations Offering Community Based Rapid HIV Testing Men Who Have Sex With Men ( MSM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Studies show know one 's HIV positive status , may lead reduction sexual risk behaviour . The introduction new form rapid HIV test urban area , may benefit public health sector , notably identify primary HIV infection , prevent secondary HIV transmission decrease spread HIV infection . Studies also show rapid HIV testing , yield same-day result , enable great number individual population risk become aware HIV status . Issue : The work hypothesis current screening system sufficiently suitable MSM . A community-based rapid HIV test program could better target high risk MSM population shorten delay risky behaviour HIV testing . Design : This intervention could enable assessment feasibility community-based rapid HIV testing . Moreover could compare traditional CDAG ( Free Anonymous Screening Consultation Centre de dépistage anonyme et gratuit French ) center test community-based rapid testing . A pre-study phase first realise characterize MSM population undergo HIV test , promote begin survey . During normal opening hour five test center , client randomize rapid finger-stick blood specimen test conventional test . During evening week-ends ( i.e . center close ) community base rapid HIV testing propose . Schedule : The pre-study phase plan first quarter 2009 . Promotion survey begin one month experimental study turn start third quarter 2009 run 7 month . The end data analysis plan end 2010 . Outcome : We compare HIV population exposure , screen history frequency primary HIV infection diagnosis . We expect find MSM undergo community base HIV test evening week-ends , population take repeat sexual risk repeat HIV test . We also expect find form test characterized term satisfaction non-inferior compare classic one . In long term , result confirm , rapid HIV testing could extend strictly community-based site .</detailed_description>
