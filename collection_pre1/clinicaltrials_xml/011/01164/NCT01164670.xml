	<brief_summary>Sarcopenia , age-related decline muscle mass function ( widely recognize `` frailty '' ) , increasingly appreciate , primarily research environment . Interventions prevent treat sarcopenia anticipate reduce fall , fracture thereby facilitate independence improve quality life old adult . Unfortunately , current consensus definition sarcopenia , thereby impede clinical recognition treatment . It advocate low appendicular ( arm leg ) lean mass , measure DXA , utilized clinical diagnostic tool define sarcopenia . While approach possible , however , muscle strength loss rapid mass loss , indicate deterioration muscle `` quality . '' Muscle quality may affect change neuromuscular , cellular subcellular level ; parameter detect measure mass alone . Clearly , tool evaluate muscle performance , simply mass , need optimally identify , subsequently monitor , treatment old adult sarcopenia . While current test muscle power/function ( e.g. , chair-rising , self-selected gait velocity , etc . ) correlate functional limitation old adult , exist test limitation perform people , may `` yes/no '' result rather continuous scale may highly precise . Thus , improve muscle function assessment tool need , clinically research venue . Jumping mechanography likely one methodology .</brief_summary>
