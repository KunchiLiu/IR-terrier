	<brief_summary>Rationale : Like primary breast cancer , prognosis recurrent breast cancer correlate regional lymph node status . Therefore , axillary staging may warrant patient recurrent disease intact axillary node , although describe guideline yet . The lymphatic drainage pathway breast and/or axilla could change due prior surgery and/or radiotherapy . These aberrant drainage pathway could detect lymphatic mapping sentinel node biopsy ( SNB ) , lead accurate staging . Objective : To assess technical feasibility lymphoscintigraphy prior breast surgery . A second goal investigate whether previous breast surgery ( without radiotherapy ) significantly change lymphatic drainage pathway breast .</brief_summary>
