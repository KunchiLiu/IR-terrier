	<detailed_description>In spite long-standing hypothesis relate diet physical activity several cancer , diet physical activity-cancer association modest best often inconsistent epidemiologic study . Investigators around world become increasingly concerned error measurement diet physical activity compromise ability detect important modest association . Most commonly use diet physical activity assessment method base relatively small set question ( e.g . 124 food item consume 5-10 physical activity past 12 month ) . Recent development computer technology provide opportunity use internet-based instrument assess individual diet physical activity accurately cost effectively . NCI develop two web-based instrument , automate self-administered 24-hour dietary recall ( ASA24 ) physical activity 24-hour recall ( ACT24 ) , administer several time year . Although two instrument potential qualitatively improve exposure assessment ( relatively low cost ) , need evaluate feasibility incorporate cohort large scale . Therefore , propose test ASA24 ACT24 among AARP member age 50 year evaluate technical problem , determine response rate , estimate range dietary intake physical activity . In addition , propose include feasibility study two web-based version conventional questionnaire ( lifestyle medical history questionnaire diet history questionnaire ) well two software system need conduct web-based study ( automate Study Management System Web Survey Management System ) . We initially target 15,000 AARP member , expect approximately 2,000 individual agree participate study 1,250 participant complete ASA24 ACT24 twice . These web-based instrument accompany system tool represent novel approach carry diet lifestyle research . The computerized , web-based study method apply observational study , large small , case-control cohort , well randomize control trial . This feasibility study provide opportunity ass feasibility construct large web-based cohort study characterize potential participant .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>We recruit 5,000 subject exist NIHAARP study participant currently 62 83 year old . To include individual least 50 year old , expand recruitment effort 10,000 new AARP member least 50 year old currently NIHAARP study cohort member . We target individual reside one follow state : Florida ; Pennsylvania ; New Jersey ; Louisiana ; North Carolina ; California ; Detroit ; Michigan ; Atlanta , Georgia , Nevada , Arizona , Texas , Illinois , Washington , Wisconsin , Colorado , Connecticut , Kentucky , Utah Massachusetts ( subject change due availability highquality state cancer registry ) .
