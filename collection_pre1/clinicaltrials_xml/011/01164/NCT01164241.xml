	<brief_summary>Background : - Allergic inflammation central allergy-related disease disorder , asthma , food allergy , atopic dermatitis . Atopic dermatitis , commonly call eczema chronic , noncontagious skin condition , usually start first year life , cause itch scale individual skin . Because atopic dermatitis common condition child allergy-related disease , include asthma , researcher interest study individual atopic dermatitis close relative ( parent child ) good understand allergy-related disease develop progress . In addition , patient inherit disorder feature include atopic dermatitis aspects allergy food allergy , asthma , hay fever , hive , others , also see . Objectives : - To study natural history disease allergic inflammation , atopic dermatitis genetic disorder associate allergic inflammation . Eligibility : - Children adolescent 1 month 21 year age document history moderate severe atopic dermatitis . - Individuals 1 month 80 year age suspect genetic inherit allergy disorder relate atopic dermatitis allergic pathway . - Child adult relative eligible participant also study protocol . Design : - The study require one initial visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( last 1-5 day ) , well require follow-up visit treatment research study . Participants receive treatment atopic dermatitis allergic disease part study 1 year . - Participants follow test part study : - A detailed physical examination medical history - Allergy skin prick test examine participant ' response different allergen . - Blood sample additional allergen testing , test immune system , research purpose - Skin punch biopsy take skin sample - Lung function test measure airflow lung inflammation - Food-related test diagnose potential food allergy - Leukapheresis collect white blood cell - Research sample , include stool specimen , saliva sample , buccal swab ( collect cell inside cheek ) , skin cell sample - Clinical digital photography provide image affect healthy skin . - Participants ask return follow-up visit test 1 year initial visit ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Diseases Associated With Allergic Inflammation : Atopic Dermatitis Genetic Congenital Diseases Associated With Atopic Pathways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Allergic inflammation central pathogenesis allergic disease , include atopic dermatitis , asthma , allergic rhinitis , food allergy . These disorder common , affect 50 million Americans , pathophysiology remain poorly understood . Among allergic disease , atopic dermatitis common , prevalence 20 % child , associate dramatic elevation IgE level prominent T-helper type 2 cell ( Th2 ) inflammation , treatment remain challenge . Atopic dermatitis also first manifestation allergic disease many child , make ideal disorder study mechanism development progression allergic disease . In addition atopic dermatitis , also number genetic congenital disease , present childhood , prominent allergic manifestation , include dermatitis , affect atopic pathway . These disorder provide opportunity advance understanding genetics pathophysiology diseases allergic inflammation . The NIAID Laboratory Allergic Diseases ( LAD ) long interest explore mechanism allergic inflammation . Utilizing resource LAD NIH Clinical Center , advance understand allergic inflammation genetics pathogenesis allergic disease study patient . The finding protocol implication improve diagnosis , treatment prevention allergic disease , include atopic asthma . Objectives : The overall goal exploratory protocol study natural history disease allergic inflammation , focus subject moderate severe atopic dermatitis suspect genetic congenital disorder associate allergic inflammation . Research study obtain participant use explore genetic , immunologic , structural , microbiologic abnormality diseases . Research study obtain blood sample , allergy skin testing , skin biopsy unaffective relative healthy volunteer use control assays genetic test . Results research study correlate clinical feature allergic manifestation disease response therapy . Eligibility : Subjects eligible enrollment study include child subset adult moderate severe atopic dermatitis child adult suspect genetic congenital disorder associate atopy affect atopic pathway . Unaffected relative enrol subject ( child adult ) healthy adult volunteer also eligible separate enrollment . Design : The initial enrollment protocol 600 primary subject 5 year . In addition , approximately 300 healthy affect parent , sibling , relative may enrol initial history clinical research laboratory evaluation . Approximately 150 unrelated healthy adult volunteer also enrol . Atopic dermatitis subject study receive standard care allergic disease , outpatient inpatient , period enrollment receive extensive evaluation clinically indicate , addition research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subject unaffected relative must : 1 . Be least 2 year age less equal 21 year age time enrollment document history AD , modify Hanifin Rajka criterion , begin first 5 year life , moderate severe , continue active flare precede 3 month . Patients great 21 year age active moderate severe AD may enrol , discretion PI AIs , history AD first 5 year life and/or , opinion PI AIs , patient would interest fulfill objective study . OR 2 . Be 280 year age suspect genetic congenital disorder associate atopy affect atopic pathway , determine PI AIs . OR 3 . Be unaffected relative patient enrol protocol . 2 . Have private physician provide local continuity care . 3 . Provide letter referral , copy pertinent medical history laboratory study indicate , prospective study participant refer physician ; requirement healthy relative . 4 . Be willing donate blood , buccal swab , saliva , skin nasal swab research clinical study storage used future research ; unaffected relative , willing donate blood and/or undergo allergy skin testing , addition blood sample store future research . Healthy Volunteer must : 1 . Be least 18 year old great 80 year old . 2 . Have history recent , active , moderate severe atopic dermatitis . 3 . Be willing sample store research genetic testing . 4 . For subset subject participate cool cuff procedure , willing research skin biopsy perform . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any subject follow criterion exclude : 1 . Presence condition , judgment investigator refer physician , may put subject undue risk make unsuitable participation study . 2 . Inability refusal undergo study procedure . 3 . Inability participate duration study . Any unaffected relative healthy volunteer follow criterion exclude : 1 . Presence condition , judgment investigator refer physician , may put subject undue risk make unsuitable participation study . 2 . Inability refusal undergo study procedure .</criteria>
