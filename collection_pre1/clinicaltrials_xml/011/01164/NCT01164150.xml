	<brief_summary>Post-operative radiotherapy internationally accept standard practice management high-risk endometrial cancer1 . Whilst proven impact overall survival significantly increase local control . Conventional radiotherapy technique ( 3-dimensional ) utilise 3 4 field beam arrangement target pelvis order treat area risk recurrence : vagina , parametrium pelvic lymph node . However , use technique possible avoid irradiate sensitive normal tissue bowel bladder . Toxicity data international randomise control trial endometrial cancer report significantly haematological , gastrointestinal , genitourinary cutaneous toxicites ( grade ) receive pelvic irradiation compare not2,3 . These trial deliver radiotherapy use 2 3-dimensional technique . Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) new establish radiotherapy technique many tumour site allow u much tightly conform radiation . It use computer-generated beam produce radiotherapy volume avoid irradiation normal tissue pelvis . There randomised study report literature compare 3-dimensional pelvic irradiation IMRT patient surgery endometrial cancer . However several small study report considerable spar normal tissue use IMRT compare retrospectively conventionally treated patient demonstrate mark reduction acute gastrointestinal genitourinary toxicity4 . By deliver post-operative radiotherapy pelvis use IMRT ( opposed standard 3-dimensional technique ) anticipate whilst local control survival unaffected acute late toxicity reduce .</brief_summary>
