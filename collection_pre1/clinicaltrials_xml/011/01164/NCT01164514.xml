	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety experimental vaccine sepsis ( infection blood ) alone experimental adjuvant ( substance may improve vaccine effectiveness ) . This study also find well antibody make receive vaccine alone vaccine combine adjuvant . Participants include 34 healthy volunteer age 18-50 year . Participants randomly assign 1 4 group receive vaccine alone , vaccine adjuvant ( 2 different dosage ) placebo ( inactive substance ) . Participants receive 3 vaccination different time study ( Day 0 , Day 29 Day 59 ) .

	<brief_title>Detoxified J5 Core Glycolipid/ Group B Meningococcal Outer Membrane Protein Vaccine Gram-negative Bacterial Sepsis Administered With Without Synthetic CPG Oligodeoxynucleotide 7909 Adjuvant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive Gram negative bacterial infection result sepsis continue command substantial morbidity mortality despite effective antibiotic modern intensive care . It estimate 300,000 case per year United States . The emergence multiple antibiotic resistant strain bacteria add urgency find novel therapy treatment gram negative sepsis . Sepsis systemic inflammatory condition characterize fever , hypotension , tachypnea , tachycardia lead multiple organ/system failure ultimately death . This study randomize , partial blind , placebo-controlled phase I safety immunogenicity study healthy subject detoxify J5 core glycolipid/ group B meningococcal outer membrane protein vaccine gram-negative bacterial sepsis administer without synthetic unmethylated cytosine-guanosine motif ( CPG ) oligodeoxynucleotide 7909 adjuvant . The primary objective study establish safety tolerability combination vaccine CPG 7909 . The secondary objective study determine combination vaccine CPG 7909 immunogenic vaccine alone . One dosage level vaccine base lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) content study three-dose regimen administer intramuscularly ( IM ) . Since prior experience indicate significant difference immunogenicity response 10 25 microgram ( mcg ) dose vaccine , researcher test 10 mcg dose . Researchers also use 2 different dos CPG 7909 adjuvant ( 500 mcg 250 mcg ) . There control group receive normal saline ( NS ) alone ( placebo ) . The purpose study ass whether vaccine safe well tolerate give adjuvant , CPG 7909 . The goal study ascertain whether combination vaccine adjuvant induces robust antibody response vaccine observe vaccine alone . The study population include approximately 28-34 healthy subject age 18-50 year , inclusive , recruit exist pool Center Vaccine Development ( CVD ) subject . Subjects randomize one four study group : ( Group 1 ) 10 mcg vaccine alone ; ( Group 2 ) 10 mcg vaccine plus 500 mcg CPG 7909 ; ( Group 3 ) 10 mcg vaccine plus 250 mcg CPG 7909 ; ( Group 4 ) placebo ( normal saline ) . After blood obtain pre-vaccination antibody level , subject receive 3 vaccination Day 0 , 29 59 . Subjects follow safety ( clinical sign symptom laboratory test ) antibody response ( anti-core glycolipid antibody enzyme link immunosorbent assay [ ELISA ] , opsonophagocytic response ) . Assessments reactogenicity do 60 minute post vaccination first second day vaccination CVD via 8 day memory aid , complete subject , vaccination . An electrocardiogram ( EKG ) perform vaccination . Blood sample perform Days 0 , 14 , 36 , 66 , 120 , 180 , 365 measure immunogenicity vaccine without adjuvant antibody screen . A safety evaluation do telephone Day 90 , Day 150 Day 239 , final safety antibody immunogenicity evaluation do clinic visit Day 365 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female age 1850 year , inclusive . The subject provide write informed consent prior study procedure . Able attend schedule visit comply trial procedure . The subject good health determine vital sign [ heart rate &lt; 100 beat per minute ( bpm ) ; blood pressure : systolic great equal 90 mm Hg le equal 140 mm Hg ; diastolic less equal 90 mm Hg ; oral temperature &lt; 100.0 degree Fahrenheit ] , medical history ensure stable medical condition physical examination base medical history . A stable medical condition define recent change prescription medication , dose , frequency medication last 3 month health outcome specific disease consider within acceptable limit last 6 month . Any change due change health care provider , insurance company , etc , do financial reason , long class medication , consider violation inclusion criterion . Any change prescription medication due improvement disease outcome consider violation inclusion criterion . Women childbearing potential partner must surgically sterile must agree use effective method contraception agree remain method Day 120 . Male subject partner must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception Day 120 . ( e.g . hormonal contraceptive initiate least 30 day prior receipt vaccine , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , diaphragm combination contraceptive jelly , condom combination contraceptive jelly , cream , foam ; vasectomized partner ) . Have normal laboratory value hemoglobin , white blood cell ( WBC ) platelet , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) , absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) obtain complete blood count ( CBC ) , serum glucose thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) . Serum alkaline phosphatase , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine transferase ( ALT ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , Creactive protein ( CRP ) creatinine exceed upper limit normal , urinalysis must normal day screen visit .

Subject agree avoid nonstudy relate blood donation 1 year follow last immunization . History allergy severe reaction vaccine vaccine component unmethylated cytosineguanosine motif ( CPG ) component . Acute illness fever &gt; /= 38 degree Celsius/100.4 degree Fahrenheit within week prior vaccination . Prior receipt Group B meningococcal outer membrane protein ( OMP ) vaccine . Previous receipt oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant include CPG.7909 . Immunosuppression result underlie illness treatment . Use oral steroid , parenteral steroid highdose inhale ( &gt; 800 mcg/day beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent ) within 30 day prior vaccination . Acute chronic condition ( opinion investigator ) would render vaccination unsafe would interfere evaluation response include , limited following : cardiovascular , know chronic liver disease , significant renal disease , chronic lung disease , unstable neurologic disorder .
