	<brief_summary>The overall objective application conduct two-group randomize control trial ( RCT ) gather preliminary evidence efficacy brief cognitive-behavioral base PT ( CBPT ) intervention patient at-risk poor outcome follow lumbar spine surgery degenerative condition . Our central hypothesis incorporate cognitive behavioral strategy postoperative standard care PT improve surgical outcome , reduction fear movement pain catastrophizing . We establish feasibility training therapist CBPT intervention , recruit retain patient , procedure data collection study management . The long-term goal broaden availability well-accepted effective CBT strategy expand implementation traditional provider , psychologist , group provider , physical therapist , routinely interact musculoskeletal pain population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite surgical advance , 40 % patient continue chronic pain functional disability lumbar spine surgery . Our data demonstrate high fear movement risk factor increase pain disability patient population . Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) physical therapy ( PT ) intervention target fear movement proven effective decrease persistent pain functional disability patient chronic low back pain . However , efficacy combine CBT PT approach well demonstrate surgical spine population . Therefore , propose conduct two-group randomize control trial ( RCT ) gather preliminary evidence efficacy brief cognitive-behavioral base PT ( CBPT ) intervention patient at-risk poor outcome follow lumbar spine surgery degenerative condition . We hypothesize incorporate cognitive behavioral strategy postoperative standard care PT improve self-reported pain disability observe physical function , reduction fear movement pain catastrophizing ( i.e. , tendency magnify pain sensation ) . This pilot study plan recruit 80 patient high postoperative fear movement pain catastrophizing . These eligible at-risk patient randomize one two group : ( 1 ) standard PT treatment + CBPT ( 2 ) standard PT treatment + weekly phone call control attention . The CBPT program consist 1 person 5 telephone session base well-accepted effective CBT strategy . These strategy focus relaxation , problem-solving training , cognitive restructuring , behavioral self management . Primary outcome include self-reported pain disability measure Brief Pain Inventory Oswestry Disability Index . Secondary outcome consist observed physical function measure performance-based test gait speed , balance , repeat chair stand , mobility ( Short Physical Performance Battery , Timed Up Go ) . Outcome data collect baseline ( 6 week surgery ) , treatment ( 3 month surgery ) , 6 month follow surgery . The propose two-group RCT provide estimate effect size sample size associate CBPT intervention data feasible recruitment retention goal mechanisms CBPT intervention affect long-term outcome . This informative pilot data guide multicenter , three-group clinical trial validate CBPT intervention . Our long-term objective broaden availability effective CBT strategy expand implementation traditional provider , psychologist , group provider , physical therapist , routinely interact large population patient musculoskeletal pain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>English speaking adult sexes race schedule lumbar spine surgery degenerative condition ( spinal stenosis , spondylosis without myelopathy , spondylolisthesis ) consider study participation . Inclusion criterion include follow : 1 . Radiographic evidence lumbar spinal stenosis secondary degenerative change ; 2 . Surgical treatment use laminectomy without arthrodesis ( i.e. , fusion ) ; 3 . Presence back and/or low extremity pain &gt; 6 month ; 4 . No history neurological movement disorder ; 5 . No presence psychotic disease ; 6 . TSK score &gt; 39 Exclusion criterion include follow : 1 . Patients microsurgical technique primary procedure , isolated laminotomy microdiscectomy ( individual minimally invasive surgical technique tend less severe case lumbar degeneration short recovery time individual arthrodesis laminectomy without arthrodesis ) ; 2 . Patients surgery spinal deformity primary indication ( patient spinal deformity primary spinal disorder tend different recovery trajectory compare inclusion population ) ; 3 . Patients surgery secondary pseudarthrosis , trauma , infection , tumor .</criteria>
