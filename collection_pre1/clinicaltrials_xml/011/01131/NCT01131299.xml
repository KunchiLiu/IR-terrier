	<brief_summary>Background : - Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death develop country . Although statin-type drug currently effective therapeutic agent reduce CVD risk . One possible complementary approach involve use soluble dietary fiber know reduce blood cholesterol level . However , analysis show soluble fiber reduce total cholesterol level relatively small amount . - Alpha-Cyclodextrin ( Alpha-CD ) , also sell commerical form , soluble fiber derive corn use ingredient many food , bread roll , cracker , juice , reduce fat spread . It add food primarily fiber supplement also use stabilize flavor , color , vitamin , fatty acid . Studies animal human show Alpha-CD may help improve insulin resistance low LDL cholesterol level apparent side effect . More research need determine effect Alpha-CD total cholesterol level healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To determine effect oral Alpha-CD total cholesterol nondiabetic population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Oral Alpha-Cyclodextrin Decreasing Serum Cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , double-blinded , cross-over , placebo control clinical pilot study investigate effectiveness soluble dietary fiber , alpha-cyclodextrin ( alpha-CD ) , blood lipid lipoprotein level healthy human subject . alpha-CD , cyclical polymer glucose , currently sell counter food supplement common ingredient many food . This first study evaluate effect alpha-CD healthy subject . One gram alpha-CD show bind much 9 gram dietary fat , like soluble dietary fiber bile acid sequestrants ( BAS ) may decrease intestinal absorption fat , show reduce incidence cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Animal study laboratory show oral alpha-CD lower Low Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) approximately 15 percent mouse high fat diet . Other clinical trial utilize compound show safe therapy significant side effect . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age type 1 type 2 diabetes . Design : - This study require three visit NIH Clinical Center . - At first visit , participant provide information current diet exercise routine , physical examination blood urine test . At end visit , participant randomize receive either Alpha-CD placebo , ask take two 1 gram tablet three time day , anytime 1 hour end meal . Participants take total six tablet per day 12 week . - At end first 12 week , participant return clinical center another interview examination , blood urine test . At end visit , participant receive treatment give first part study ( either Alpha-CD placebo ) , take tablet schedule 12 week . - Participants wait 1 week stop previous study prescription start next one . - At end second 12 week , participant final interview examination blood urine test . - Participants ask keep 7-day food record clinic visit collect second third visit . A short physical activity assessment collect visit review change physical activity .</detailed_description>
