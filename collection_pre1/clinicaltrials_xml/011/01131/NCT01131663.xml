	<brief_summary>Face mask use many respiratory care application anaesthesia , resuscitation , aerosol therapy . None currently available face mask infant young child specifically design developed infant . The aim study design , develop test first infant 's oriented face mask . To achieve ultimate goal first define appropriate size infant ' face would use template design development optimally fit model mask . In next stage use mask incorporate infant ' soother ( pacifier ) new SootherMask ( SM ) . In last part study compare acceptance level Soothermask ( SM ) conventional commodity mask without pacifier .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Not face mask `` born equal '' care must take mask design , particularly early pediatric age group . Unfortunately , facemasks provide infant young child merely small version use adult little consideration give special need We believe major advance answer need infant rely make mask friendly user make suck infant 's soother integral part newly develop mask . This base following premise : 1 . Sucking vital feed soothe activity infant . Incorporating suck act aerosol delivery greatly reduce fear engender inconvenience put obtrusive mask infant 's face . 2 . Linking mask suck action ensures tight seal mask face . Every time baby suck pacifier bottle nipple , mask press onto face atmospheric pressure thus ensure good mask face seal . This also ensure aerosol spray hold chamber drawn baby 's lung nose inspiration . 3 . The material mask 's rim relatively wide , soft , corrugated thus highly flexible . This make mask easily compressible without overdue force infant 's face . Thus , act suck attracts mask child 's face , assist achieve good seal compress thus substantially reduce dead space volume mask . The ultimate goal present study answer specific need infant develop appropriate infant 's oriented face mask . In order achieve goal study three specific objective . Objective # 1 Define morphometric data infant ' face Objective # 2 Design develop optimally adapted face mask SootherMask ( SM ) base morphometric result Objective # 3 Compare acceptance level Soothermask ( SM ) conventional commonly use mask without pacifier .</detailed_description>
