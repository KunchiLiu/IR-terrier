	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To identify gene predictive clinical outcome ( failure-free survival overall survival ) among patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treat CHOP R-CHOP induction ECOG-E4494 use nuclease protection assay measure gene expression paraffin-embedded tissue . - To identify gene change prognostic profile addition rituximab CHOP chemotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Unstained formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded sample analyze gene expression via nuclease protection assay .</detailed_description>
