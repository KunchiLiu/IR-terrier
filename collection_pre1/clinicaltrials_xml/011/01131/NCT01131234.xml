	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose give gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 cediranib maleate together treat patient advance solid tumor . Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 cediranib maleate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Cediranib maleate also may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gamma-Secretase Inhibitor RO4929097 Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( equivalent recommend phase II dose ) , safety profile RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ) combination cediranib ( cediranib maleate ) patient advanced malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile RO4929097 administer alone RO492907 cediranib combination , order evaluate interactive effect PK ( ) two agent . II . To evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect RO492907 administer alone combination , goal identify potential predictive PD marker need exploration validation future trial . III . To assess preliminary antitumor efficacy drug combination , especially breast cancer , malignant melanoma , colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer , kidney cancer , high grade glioma , non-small-cell lung cancer , ovarian cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 ( day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 22-24 , 29-31 , 36-38 course 1 ) cediranib maleate PO QD day 1-21 ( day 22-42 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
