	<criteria>Patients must platinumresistant ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . Patients include study base follow criterion : 1 . Signed informed consent 2 . Age ≥ 19 yr 3 . Advanced , histologically documented ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer 4 . Measurable disease least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must &gt; 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain xray , CT MRI , &gt; 10 mm measure spiral CT. OR Clinically radiologically detectable disease ( ascites , peritoneal deposit , mesenteric thicken lesion fulfill RECIST measurable disease ) . In addition , subject must two consecutive rise pretreatment CA125 level &gt; 2x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) 40.0 IU/ml take least 1 week 3 month apart . 5 . Platinumresistant refractory cancer ; subject must biologic chemotherapeutic regimen treatment platinumresistant disease prior study entry . Subjects primary platinumresistant cancer must tumor recurrence within 6 month complete receive platinumcontaining regimen . These subject must nonplatinumcontaining regimen . OR Subjects secondary platinumresistant cancer may regimen response tumor recurrence within 6 month complete receive retreatment platinumcontaining regimen . These subject must receive two prior chemotherapeutic regimen . OR Subjects receive chemotherapeutic regimen consolidation response platinumcontaining regimen must tumor recurrence within 6 month complete receive consolidation regimen . 6 .

Major surgery , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 4 week prior Day 1 treatment , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study 12 . Inability comply study followup procedure 13 . Any disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug may affect interpretation result render subject high risk treatment complication 14 . Life expectancy le 12 week 15 . Current , recent ( within 4 week first infusion study ) , plan participation experimental drug study Genentechsponsored bevacizumab cancer study 16 . Inadequately control hypertension ( define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg antihypertensive medication ) 17 .
