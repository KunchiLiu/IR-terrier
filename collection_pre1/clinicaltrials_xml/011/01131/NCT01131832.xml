	<brief_summary>The substantial range individual responsiveness plant sterol important ramification . Marked difference across individual particular aspect cholesterol metabolic pathway must alter impact plant sterol consumption . As , pronounce need exists understand genetic metabolic factor explain substantial degree heterogeneity response lipid concentration plant sterol across individual . The primary focus trial delineate impact differ cholesterol synthesis level response LDL-C plasma lipid plant sterol consumption . Participants pre-identified high low endogenous cholesterol synthesizer , accord screen level lathosterol cholesterol ratio , give PS placebo contain margarine consume supervision 4 week crossover design . The trial characterize responsiveness participant ' total , LDL , HDL cholesterol , well triacylglycerol ( TG ) concentration , plant sterol consumption . This research determine cholesterol synthesis phenotype predict responsiveness lipid plant sterol consumption . Variations candidate gene involve cholesterol metabolism also investigate order find association cholesterol metabolism phenotype responsiveness lipid plant sterol . The output research advance knowledge genetic factor influence degree cardiovascular benefit derive plant sterol lipid lowering .</brief_summary>
