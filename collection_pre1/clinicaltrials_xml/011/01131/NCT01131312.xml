Epidemiologic , virologic molecular study clearly demonstrate human papillomavirus ( HPV ) central cause cervical cancer . The motivation ALTS trial use information gain role HPV design well treatment prevention strategy reduce burden cervical cancer precursor . ALTS consist three management strategy : ( 1 ) immediate colposcopy woman ; ( 2 ) repeat cytology colposcopy result show high grade lesion ; ( 3 ) HPV test repeat cytology combination , referral colposcopy either HPV test positive cytology show high grade lesion . Four Clinical Centers University Alabama , Birmingham AL ; Magee-Womens Hospital , Pittsburgh PA ; University Oklahoma , Oklahoma City OK ; University Washington , Seattle WA enrol approximately 5,000 woman recent diagnosis ASCUS LSIL .
