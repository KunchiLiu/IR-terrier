	<brief_summary>Study design : The purpose present study analyse influence application skin care product diaper area ( Factor A ) application cotton wool cloth , moisten clear water diaper area ( Faktor B ) skin barrier function newborn first four week . Additionally , microbiological colonisation skin observe . After four week infants group obtain wet wipe 8 week facultative measurement perform . Primary secondary end point : In present study , primary end point TEWL buttock chosen , significant difference infant bath washed previous study find . Secondary end point TEWL measure point , pH-value SCH . Additionally , secondary end point D-Squame method cytokine measurement Sebutapes . Hypotheses : The intention study evaluate , whether use wet wipe diaper area influence TEWL newborn . The following hypothesis present : H0 ( Null hypothesis ) : The TEWL indistinguishable infant get clean wet wipe diaper area infant get clean cotton wool cloth , moisten clear water diaper area , i.e . TEWL clear water equal TEWL wet wipe H1 ( Alternative hypothesis - bilateral ) : The TEWL distinguishable infant get clean wet wipe diaper area infant get clean cotton wool cloth , moisten clear water diaper area , i.e . TEWL clear water equal TEWL wet wipe</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method number subject : Monocenter , prospective , randomize study two parallel group . To get reliable result , number male female newborn include study 40 . The group 40 healthy full-term newborn baby divide 2 group : Number group subject Application skin care product 1 . 01-19 Using wet wipe diaper change 2 . 20-40 Using cotton wool cloth , moisten clear water diaper change . The measurement take place Clinical Research Center Hair Skin Physiology , Department Dermatology , Campus Charité Mitte also Department Neonatology Campus Charité Mitte , Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin . Study plan : Application : All newborn obtain standard skin care , accord division one following group : use wet wipe diaper change cotton wool cloth moisten clear water . Additionally , infant group bath twice week accord follow standard schema . The infant submerge bathtub half filled water , shoulder.The water temperature ca . 370C , pH 7.9-8.2 bathing require long 5 minute . Inclusion criterion : All healthy ( i.e . meet none non-inclusion criterion ) term newborn possible candidate study . The following criterion must meet enrollment study : 1 . Male female term newborns 37 complete week gestation , age ≤ 48 hour 2 . Written inform parental consent Non-inclusion criterion : - Any critically ill term newborn , i.e . septic infant , infant bear serious congenital malformation/defects , asphyxia , hydronephrosis , severe intracranial hemorrhage - Newborns know immunodeficiency - Newborns pre-existing skin disease eruption cover 50 % body surface i.e . congenital ichthyosis , congenital candidiasis - Newborn relevant skin maceration , influence measurement communicable i.e . urticaria herpes - Any acutely chronically ill newborn temperature 35°C 40°C - Newborn take part another study term exclusion study .</detailed_description>
