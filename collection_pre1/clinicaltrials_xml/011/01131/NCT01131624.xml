	<brief_title>Comparative Efficacy Safety Intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose ( FCM ) Versus Oral Iron Iron Deficiency Anaemia Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicentre , randomise , 2-arm study ass efficacy safety FCM compare oral iron pregnant woman IDA . During screen period ( Days -10 0 randomisation ) , subject select base eligibility criterion . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion undergo baseline assessment baseline ( Day 0 ) prior first dose study medication . Subjects randomise receive either intravenous ( IV ) iron ( FCM , 1,000-1,500 mg ) oral iron ( ferrous sulphate , 100 mg iron twice day ; total dose 200 mg/day ) . The treatment period begin infusion FCM intake oral iron Day 0 . All subject return assessment efficacy safety Weeks 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 delivery ( whichever come first ) .</detailed_description>
