	<brief_summary>This Phase Ib/II study openlabel , multicenter study patient solid tumor breast cancer amenable anthracyclin therapy . The study divide two part : Phase I : open-label , dose escalation study F16IL2 combination doxorubicin patient solid tumor . Phase II : prospective , single-arm , multicentre study fix dose F16IL2 combination doxorubicin , equivalent stage 1 Simon two-stage phase II design , patient breast cancer amenable anthracyclin therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer major cause cancer mortality , second lung cancer cause cancer death woman . The five-year survival rate localize breast cancer increase 80 percent 1950s 98 percent today . However , mortality rate advance form remain unsatisfactory . Indeed , extensive use mammography within screen program lead cancer detect earlier , early treatment may effective . A great understanding molecular biology genetic expression breast cancer therefore lead new pre-surgical post-surgical treatment , include hormone modulators monoclonal antibody . Many agent lead decreased mortality disease recurrence . F16 human recombinant antibody fragment scFv ( single chain Fragment variable ) format direct tenascin C , angiogenesis marker common solid tumor independent tumor type . ScFv ( F16 ) selectively localizes tumor tissue animal model demonstrate histologically mechanistic study involve mouse transfected orthotopic human tumour . IL2 , human cytokine interleukin-2 , potent stimulator immune response . It central role regulation T cell response effect immune cell natural killer cell , B cell , monocyte/macrophages neutrophil ( Smith , 1988 ) . IL2 induce tumor regression ability stimulate potent cell-mediated immune response vivo ( Rosenberg , 2000 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• For Phase I study : For patient Phase I cohort 1 i.e . patient receive F16IL2 alone , patient must amenable therapy doxorubicin/anthracycline must consider Principal Investigator suitable candidate F16IL2 therapy alone . Histologically cytologically confirm solid cancer with/without evidence locally advance metastatic disease ( Appendix B ) . For advanced solid cancer patient , patient may receive previous chemotherapy radiation therapy , must amenable doxorubicin treatment accord discretion principal investigator . For Phase II study : Histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer . Previous anthracycline therapy , include liposomal doxorubicin , metastatic and/or adjuvant disease allow . However , patient must receive cumulative anthracycline dose 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin 600 mg/m2 epirubicin pegylated nonpegylated liposomal doxorubicin , prior study entry , order avoid anthracyclineassociated cardiotoxicity . Prior radiation therapy allow , irradiated area source measurable assessable disease . Patients suitable trastuzumab therapy ( i.e. , evidence HER2overexpressing disease , trastuzumab therapy exhaust HER2overexpressing disease ) . • For phase I II study : Patients age ≥18 year . Patients recruit Phase I , cohort I must consider suitable doxorubicin/anthracycline therapy opinion Principal Investigator . Only phase I , patient must receive 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin 500 mg/m2 epirubicin prior chemotherapy . Patients must least one unidimensionally measurable lesion compute tomography define RECIST criterion ( see Section APPENDIX A ) . This lesion must irradiate previous treatment . All acute toxic effect ( exclude alopecia ) prior therapy ( include surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy ) must resolve National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) ( v3.0 ) Grade ≤ 1 . Sufficient hematologic , liver renal function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L , platelet ≥ 100 x 10^9/L , haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.5 g/dl . Alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 x upper limit reference range ( ULN ) , total bilirubin ≥ 2.0 mg/gL unless liver involvement tumor , case transaminase level could 5 x ULN . Creatinine ≥ 1.5 ULN 24 h creatinine clearance ≤ 50 mL/min . Life expectancy least 12 week . Documented negative test human immunodeficiency virus . Negative serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential within 14 day start treatment . If childbearing potential , agreement use adequate contraceptive method ( e.g. , oral contraceptive , condom , adequate barrier control , intrauterine contraceptive device , sterilization ) begin screen visit continue 3 month follow last treatment study drug . Evidence personally sign dated Ethics Committeeapproved Informed Consent form indicate patient ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect study . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test study procedure . Presence active infection ( e.g . require antibiotic therapy ) severe concurrent disease , , opinion investigator , would place patient undue risk interfere study . Presence known brain metastasis . However , presence control brain metastasis ( i.e. , evaluate SD PR radiotherapy ) allow . Known second uncontrolled cancer primary origin within last 5 year . Chronic active hepatitis active autoimmune disease . History within last year acute subacute coronary syndrome include myocardial infarction , unstable severe stable angina pectoris . Heart insufficiency ( &gt; Grade II , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) criterion ) . Irreversible cardiac arrhythmia require permanent medication . LVEF ≤ 50 % and/or abnormality observe baseline MUGA , ECHO ECG investigation . Uncontrolled hypertension . Ischemic peripheral vascular disease ( Grade IIbIV ) . Severe rheumatoid arthritis . Severe diabetic retinopathy . Recovery major trauma include surgery within 4 week administration study treatment . Known history allergy IL2 , doxorubicin , intravenously administer human proteins/peptides/antibodies . Pregnancy breast feed . Female patient must agree use effective contraception , surgically sterile postmenopausal . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Phase I : Chemotherapy ( standard experimental ) radiation therapy within 4 week administration study treatment . Phase II : Chemotherapy ( standard experimental ) within 4 week administration study treatment . Radiation therapy within 6 week administration study treatment . Cumulative exposure anthracyclinecontaining chemotherapy prior study entry preclude application least additional 150 mg/m2 doxorubicin ( total dose 2 cycle study therapy ) . Treatment investigational study drug within 6 week begin treatment F16IL2 . Previous vivo exposure monoclonal antibody biological therapy 6 week administration study treatment . Growth factor immunomodulatory agent within 7 day administration study treatment . Neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 Patient require take corticosteroid immunosuppressant drug longterm basis . Limited use corticosteroid treat prevent acute hypersensitivity reaction consider exclusion criterion . Any condition opinion investigator could hamper compliance study protocol .</criteria>
