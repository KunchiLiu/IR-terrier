	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , cyclophosphamide , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether bevacizumab effective give together paclitaxel cyclophosphamide capecitabine treat patient breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study side effect give bevacizumab together paclitaxel see well work compare give bevacizumab together cyclophosphamide capecitabine first-line therapy treat woman locally advance , recurrent , metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine bevacizumab paclitaxel versus bevacizumab , metronomic cyclophosphamide , capecitabine first-line therapy cause less medication-related adverse event woman HER2-negative metastatic , locally advanced , recurrent breast cancer . - To compare quality life ( QOL ) patient treat regimen . - To replicate previous finding well QOL patient complete response partial response versus stable disease 6 month great . - To determine predictive value baseline QOL duration meaningful change QOL patient treat chemotherapy . - To determine association QOL endpoint , select health economics , clinical endpoint . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor response ( measurable v evaluable disease ) , WHO performance status ( 0 1 v 2 ) , center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 paclitaxel IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 , oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-28 , oral capecitabine 3 time day day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire ( BL-QA ) health economics questionnaire ( BL-HEA EQ-5D ) baseline , , completion study therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
