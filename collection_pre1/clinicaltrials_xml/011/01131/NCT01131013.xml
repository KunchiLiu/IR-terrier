	<brief_title>A Study CK-2017357 Patients With Peripheral Artery Disease Symptomatic Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase II , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , three-way crossover design two single dos CK-2017357 patient peripheral artery disease symptomatic claudication . 36 72 patient randomize approximately 15 study center one six different treatment sequence . Each treatment sequence consist three dose period patient receive single oral dos placebo , 375 mg 500 mg CK-2017357 . All six treatment sequence enroll approximately number patient . A wash period least 6 day ( maximum 10 day ) employ individual dos patient . This study design assess effect CK-2017357 measure endurance/fatigue , work output , walk capacity . The PK PD relationship CK-2017357 two single dos assess versus placebo , CK-2017357 concentration versus time data obtain study may use develop population PK model estimate intra- inter-patient variability PK parameter patient claudication .</detailed_description>
