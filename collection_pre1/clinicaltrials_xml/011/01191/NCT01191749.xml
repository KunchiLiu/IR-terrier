	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study determine effectiveness alemtuzumab patient aplastic anemia , MDS , T-Cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia . The safety alemtuzumab also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) , Aplastic Anemia , T-Cell Large Granular Lymphocytic Leukemia ( T-GL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Alemtuzumab design attach protein find certain immune cell , may cause cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive alemtuzumab Days 1-10 one 28-day cycle . It give either vein 2 hour injection skin 1 time day . Your doctor tell drug give . In order get alemtuzumab provide treatment , study staff fill form name medical information ( protect health information ) company part Campath Distribution Program . All participant receive dose alemtuzumab unless start dose cause intolerable side effect . If happens , future participant receive low dose . Depending doctor 's decision , low risk side effect receive Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) drug steroid ( either mouth short infusion vein ) , 30 minute alemtuzumab dose . If receive alemtuzumab chill infusion , may receive Demerol ( meperidine hydrochloride , painkiller ) help control . Starting Day 1 continue least 8 week last dose study drug , give 2 antibiotic help fight infection . You take Valacyclovir ( similar drug ) 1 time day . You take Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( similar drug ) 2 time day , 3 time per week . You take antibiotic mouth . Study Visits : At Week 1 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At Weeks 2-4 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Beginning Week 5 ( +/- 3 day ) 1 time monthly : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . At Week 12 ( +/- 3 day ) ( end 3rd month ) , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy test chromosome abnormality ( chromosome abnormal screen ) check status disease . You may additional bone marrow aspiration biopsy doctor feels necessary . You ask side effect may study visit . At time study , doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT scan , PET scan check status disease . Length Study : You receive one cycle study drug . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . You take study early disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of Study-Visit : When come study end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check chromosome abnormality , test low level leukemia lymphoma , check status disease , molecular testing . Molecular test design look way different part cell ( include DNA , RNA , proteins ) work together . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check level T-cells immunoglobulin . This investigational study . Alemtuzumab FDA-approved treatment patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . The use alemtuzumab treat MDS , aplastic anemia , T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia investigational . Up 29 participant take part study . All participant enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis MDS ( Low , Int1 IPSS , hypocellular ) either previously untreated previously treat eligible trial . 2 . Patients diagnosis aplastic anemia previously treat eligible inclusion currently candidate allogeneic stem cell transplant . 3 . Patients diagnosis TLGL previously treat eligible inclusion . 4 . Patients must cytotoxic , immunosuppressive , targeted therapy ( except hydroxyurea ) least 2 week prior enter study , recover toxic effect therapy grade 1 less . 5 . Adequate organ function define : liver function ( bilirubin &lt; = 2mg/dL , AST and/or ALT &lt; = 3 x ULN ) ; kidney function ( creatinine &lt; = 2.5 x ULN ) . 6 . ECOG performance status &lt; = 3 . 7 . The effect alemtuzumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 8 . A negative urine pregnancy test require within 1 week woman childbearing potential prior enrol trial . 9 . Patient must ability understand requirement study sign informed consent . A sign informed consent patient legally authorize representative require prior enrollment protocol . 10 . Patients indication therapy disease transfusion dependence morbidity associate cytopenia ( ) bleeding , severe fatigue , frequent/multiple infection ( eg . neutropenia ) . 1 . Pregnant woman exclude study alemtuzumab agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother alemtuzumab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated alemtuzumab . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . 2 . Known HIV infection . 3 . Known Hepatitis B Hepatitis C infection . 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 5 . Patient document hypersensitivity alemtuzumab .</criteria>
