	<brief_summary>Human cancer express tumor antigen target cytolytic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) . These antigen consist small peptide , derive endogenous protein , present cancer cell 's surface HLA class I molecule . Such antigenic peptide , include MAGE-3.A1 NA17.A2 , test experimental therapeutic vaccine elicit CTL response cancer patient , mainly metastatic melanoma . Up , rare tumor response observe . Tumor resistance CTL kill likely explanation poor effectiveness cancer vaccine . This resistance probably acquire tumor development select repetitive challenge spontaneous anti-tumoral immune response . The precise molecular mechanism tumor resistance remain unknown . The observation tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) purify melanoma metastasis recognize kill autologous tumor cell vitro , whilst seem unable control tumor growth vivo , suggest resistance host tumor environment , rather result generalize immune suppression . The investigator develop murine model cutaneous graft rejection mimic situation melanoma . Female CBA mouse reject syngeneic male skin graft , even though mount spontaneous CTL response H-Y , male specific minor histocompatibility antigen , follow grafting . The investigator test various experimental procedure aim induce effective graft rejection mouse . This obtained combination IFN-α , IL-2 , GM-CSF , administer separately skin graft , associate topical application imiquimod . All agent available register drug . Based murine model cutaneous allograft rejection , investigator postulate local immunomodulation combination trigger effective tumor rejection process , induce efficient long-lasting anti-tumoral immune response follow peptide vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peptide Vaccination Associated With Tumoral Immunomodulation Patients With Advanced Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive follow treatment : 1 . Vaccinations : The vaccine MAGE-3.A1 and/or NA17.A2 peptide , match patient 's HLA type gene expression tumor . If antigen express , patient receive peptide . 2 . Local treatment combination immunomodulatory drug : This treatment combine peritumoral injection IL-2 , IFN-α GM-CSF ( 6000 IU , 100.000 IU 300 ng per tumor inject , respectively ) , well topical application imiquimod ( applied 24h ) . The peritumoral injection cytokine give day +2 , +3 , +4 , +7 , +8 +9 , Aldara® cream apply day +2 +7 follow vaccine 3 4 . One 2 cutaneous lesion treat , 2 lesion present day 29 treatment , respectively .</detailed_description>
