	<brief_summary>The ProSeal laryngeal mask airway ( PLMA ) one alternative method effective airway management . It advance form laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) soft large cuff improve seal drain tube permit vent stomach . However , large cuff difficult save space insertion mouth likely fold . Particularly , relatively large tongue , floppy epiglottis , cephalad anterior larynx frequent presence tonsillar hypertrophy may disturb PLMA insertion pediatric patient . The manufacturer recommend insert PLMA use digital manipulation introducer , technique low success rate compare LMA insertion . McIvor blade tongue retractor thin curve blade flat handle . It use secure operate field press tongue tonsillectomy . The investigator hypothesize McIvor blade would provide space mouth PLMA insertion , therefore could improve PLMA insertion well reduce injury pharyngeal wall . The investigator compare success rate incidence complication digital technique McIvor blade-guided insertion unskilled anesthesia resident .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rapid successful airway management important patient 's outcome emergency care . Tracheal intubation endotracheal tube gold standard airway management , tracheal intubation paramedical staff pre-hospital set time-consuming difficult . The ProSealTM laryngeal mask airway ( PLMA ) one alternative method effective airway management . It advance form laryngeal mask airway ( LMA ) soft large cuff improve seal drain tube permit vent stomach . However , large cuff difficult save space insertion mouth likely fold . Particularly , relatively large tongue , floppy epiglottis , cephalad anterior larynx frequent presence tonsillar hypertrophy may disturb PLMA insertion pediatric patient . The manufacturer recommend insert PLMA use digital manipulation introducer , technique low success rate compare LMA insertion . The first attempt success rate PLMA insertion inexperienced personnel report 83 % . Several technique introduce improve insertion success rate ; use fiberoscopy , gum-elastic bougie , suction catheter . However , save enough oral space PLMA insertion would easy unskilled personnel use emergency situation . A large space tongue retropharynx , accompany index finger insertion would make make easy unskilled personnel insert PLMA . McIvor blade tongue retractor thin curve blade flat handle . It use secure operate field press tongue tonsillectomy . We hypothesize McIvor blade would provide space mouth PLMA insertion , therefore could improve PLMA insertion well reduce injury pharyngeal wall . We compare success rate incidence complication digital technique McIvor blade-guided insertion unskilled anesthesia resident .</detailed_description>
