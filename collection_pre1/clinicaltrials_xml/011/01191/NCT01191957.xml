	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective phase III , open-label , randomize multicenter study evaluate whether Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) elderly patient Complete Remission ( CR ) undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reduce toxicity condition regimen ( I.V . BuFlu ) compare conventional I.V . BuCy2 program experience : 1 . A low transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) 1 year Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplant ( HSCT ) 2 . A similar anti-leukemic activity similar good safety profile , term : - Early and/or late graft rejection - Hematopoietic immunologic recovery - Chimerism - Toxicity incidence Veno-occlusive Disease ( VOD ) - Acute ( aGvHD ) chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGvHD ) - Cumulative incidence TRM +100 day 2 year transplant - Cumulative incidence relapse 1 2 year transplant - Event-free ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) 1 2 year transplant</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Busulfan ( BU ) Plus Fludarabine Vs Intravenous BU Plus Cyclophosphamide Conditioning Regimens Prior Allogeneic Hematopoetic Stem Cells Transplant ( HSCT ) AML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation ( HSCT ) potentially curative treatment modality patient Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) . An effective conditioning regimen base association oral Busulfan 4 mg/kg daily 4 dos , 1 mg/kg , 4 successive day ( total dose , 16 mgkg ) , follow CY 60 mg/kg intravenously 2 successive day ( BuCy2 ) . The antileukemic activity latter program test confirm large randomized clinical trial conduct AML Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML ) patient BU-CY regimen associate survival relapse probability compare favourably CY-Total Body Irradiation ( TBI ) regimen . The BuCy2 program consider golden standard preparative regimen allogeneic transplantation AML patient . Nonetheless , many year treatment related toxicity full myeloablative conditioning regimen substantially limit overall applicability transplant procedure young patient good performance status ( PS ) . The observation allogeneic stem cell transplant potentially curative graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect addition antileukemic action myeloablative conditioning regimen major stimulus development reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimens , aim primarily secure engraftment provide GVL effect , minimize regimen-related toxicity . The observation allogeneic stem cell transplant potentially curative graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect addition antileukemic action myeloablative conditioning regimen major stimulus development reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimens , aim primarily secure engraftment provide GVL effect , minimize regimen-related toxicity . As consequence reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimens might give possibility extend access allogeneic transplantation patient would previously consider reasonable candidate age presence comorbidities . However , lot initial enthusiasm , become clear intensive conditioning associate reduce risk relapse HSCT . Therefore , clear RIC transplant open way use allogeneic SCT patient several year old upper age limit 60 , superiority RIC approach assume even subgroup patient . This , recently , investigator look conditioning program well tolerate still might retain strong ability induce direct ablation leukemic hematopoiesis . This lead new concept reduce toxicity rather reduce intensity conditioning program . One program base association myeloablative dose intravenous Busulfan ( 0.8 mg/kg/d 4 day ) , Fludarabine ( 30 mg/m2/d 4 day ) report highly effective patient AML . In elderly patient disease , program might lead overall outcome least good follow conventional myeloablative program base Cyclophosphamide combine dose IV Busulfan TBI . In fact , compare latter program , Busulfan Fludarabine regimen find associate low non relapse mortality although high relapse rate still document , publish experience . In , outcomes standard transplant regimens generally improve newer myeloablative regimen Fludarabine full-dose intravenous Busulfan achieve 1 year TRM 10 % . So , base consideration , protocol GITMO-AML.R2 design compare intravenous Busulfan plus Fludarabine ( BuFlu ) versus Busulfan ( I.V . Bu ; Busilvex® ) plus Cyclophosphamide ( BuCy2 ) conditioning regimens prior allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( alloHSCT ) patient ( age 40 65 year ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Complete Remission ( CR ) . So , base consideration , protocol GITMO-AML.R2 design compare intravenous Busulfan plus Fludarabine ( BuFlu ) versus Busulfan ( I.V . Bu ; Busilvex® ) plus Cyclophosphamide ( BuCy2 ) conditioning regimens prior allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation ( alloHSCT ) patient ( age 40 65 year ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) Complete Remission ( CR ) . The principal objective trial evaluation one year transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) AML patient undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reduce toxicity conditioning regimen ( I.V.BuFlu ) compare conventional I.V . BuCy2 program . To purpose , IV BuCy2 arm , reference TRM assume 25 % ( range 16-50 % ) IV BuFlu arm estimate 12.5 % TRM assume ( range 0-30 % ) . The study design demonstrate relative risk reduction 50 % . For event-driven two-sided test , alpha-level probability 0.05 ( type I error ) power 80 % ( type II error=0.2 ) consider . The ratio number patient include arm set equal 1:1 . The result required sample size 240 ( 120 patient arm ) . Sample size estimation base intention-to-treat principle . The accrual time 2.5 year , additional follow-up 2 year plan last patient entry study final analysis .</detailed_description>
