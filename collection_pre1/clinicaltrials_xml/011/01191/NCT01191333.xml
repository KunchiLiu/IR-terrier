	<brief_title>The Effectiveness rTMS Depressed VA Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depression occur 10 % American outpatient every year , approximately 20 % respond incompletely trial antidepressant , mood stabilizer , psychotherapy ( Kaplan Sadock , 1996 ; Keller et al 1992 ; Thase , 2004 ) . Treatment usual case treatment resistant major depression ( TRMD ) frequently involve increased risk increase side effect , see monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOIs ) electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . New TRMD treatment need , preferably without major safety concern side effect see aggressive polypharmacy ECT . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) method deliver brain stimulation without seizure risk associated ECT , potential side effect risk MAOI therapy . Systematic review meta-analysis study date , typically small scale , appear show positive effect TRMD ( Martin et al . 2003 ) . With minimal side effect profile , rarity untoward event side-effects ( Pascual-Leone et al . 1993 ; Wassermann 1997 ) , safety concern regard use rTMS considerably less ECT . Given , rTMS potential significant advance care , show effective TRMD VA patient . The trial rTMS perform date include participant comorbid disorder , substance abuse post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , thus generalizability finding VA population clear . Further research include Veterans possible comorbid disorder necessary , give high rate co-occurring substance abuse PTSD present Veteran population . The present study randomize , control trial compare active rTMS sham condition Veterans treatment resistant major depression possible comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) / history substance abuse . Veterans remain care VA primary mental health provider throughout project . Participants assess pre- , mid- several post-treatment time point . This multisite trial conduct 9 VA Medical Centers around country .</detailed_description>
