	<brief_summary>The hypothesis underlie study phosphate interfere PTH-mediated calcium reabsorption distal nephron thereby necessitate supranormal [ PTH ] maintain normocalcemia chronic kidney disease . This study examine hypothesis measure phosphate homeostasis calcium reabsorption . A double-blind trial intestinal phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate employ examine whether reduction phosphate influx alter distal nephron phosphate concentration [ PTH ] require calcium reabsorption expect manner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The parathyroid hormone concentration ( [ PTH ) ] rise glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) fall . This almost universal phenomenon call secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT ) . [ PTH ] rise dietary phosphate chronic kidney disease . [ PTH ] also rise stable dietary phosphate GFR fall . The mechanism underlie phenomena unknown . We hypothesize phosphate exerts effect [ PTH ] cortical distal nephron ( CDN ) . Ordinarily , intestinal phosphate absorption fall proportion GFR chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) progress . Consequently , concentration phosphate increase cortical distal nephron ( CDN ) , PTH regulate tubular calcium reabsorption . We speculate increase [ P ] cdn reduces concentration free calcium complexation , thereby necessitate high [ PTH ] achievement calcium reabsorption sufficient maintain normocalcemia . We show algebraically [ P ] cdn proportional ratio EP/Ccr , EP urinary excretion rate phosphate Ccr creatinine clearance , surrogate GFR . EP/Ccr calculate measurement aliquot serum urine [ P ] u [ cr ] s/ [ cr ] u . If hypothesis correct , anticipate [ PTH ] proportional EP/Ccr CKD , delta [ PTH ] proportional delta EP/Ccr obtain sequential determination . We study 30 patient CKD comparable number control . All subject normocalcemia . Controls see informed consent , fast state 8:00 a.m. 10:00 a.m. collection urine blood specimen . Patients CKD see five visit interval four week . At first visit , obtain informed consent obtain specimen measurement 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) . At visit 2-5 , obtain necessary specimen measure concentration PTH , fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) , 25OHD , 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) . We also measure ionize ultrafilterable calcium , creatinine , phosphorus serum calcium , phosphorus , creatinine urine . These measurement enable u follow effect intervention hormone concentration parameter calcium phosphorus homeostasis . At visit 2 prescribe vitamin D accordance [ 25OHD ] obtain visit 1 . For [ 25OHD ] &lt; 32 ng/mL , dose 50,000 units/d D2 one week , follow 2000 mg/d D2 3 week . For [ 25OHD ] &gt; 32 ng/mL , dose D3 2000 mg/d four week . The purpose intervention minimize likelihood vitamin D insufficiency deficiency contribute SHPT . At visit 3 , instruct patient phosphate-restricted diet . At visit 4 quantify metabolic effect diet , randomly assign patient receive either placebo sevelamer carbonate 800 mg tablet , 3 meal . At visit 5 , quantify effect two intervention parameter calcium phosphate homeostasis hormone concentration . We view positive regression [ PTH ] EP/Ccr ∆ [ PTH ] ∆EP/Ccr evidence hypothesis .</detailed_description>
