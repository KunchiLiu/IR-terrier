	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) common serious problem critically ill patient , know independent risk factor mortality . Among various etiology AKI , sepsis septic shock frequent contribute factor especially intensive care unit setting . Also , mortality septic AKI patient still remain extremely high despite recent mark therapeutic advance . Given physiologic superiority continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) uremia volume control , become modality choice critically ill patient AKI . In addition , CRRT theoretically provide immunohomeostasis convective adsorptive removal various immune mediator . Although pathophysiology septic AKI remain elusive , become increasingly recognize many pro- anti-inflammatory mediator , TNF , IL-6 , IL-8 IL-10 , play important role process . Therefore , speculate reduction cytokine increase CRRT dose patient septic AKI may reduce mortality risk . Even though recent two large scale randomize controlled trial , ATN RENAL study , fail show difference survival rate clearance 20~25 ml/kg/hr 35~40 ml/kg/hr , none study design elucidate survival benefit high intensity CRRT patient septic AKI . Moreover , optimal target CRRT dose patient well establish may even high 35~40 ml/kg/hr term septic AKI . Indeed , recent several uncontrolled trial show survival benefit high intensity CRRT patient . To explore effect high dose CRRT survival critically ill patient septic AKI , investigator conduct multicenter prospective randomize control open-label trial compare difference survival rate 1:1 balance pre-dilution CVVHDF 80 vs. 40 mL/Kg/hr initial 72hrs start CRRT . The primary end-point study effect high volume pre-dilution CVVHDF 28-day survival rate . The secondary end-point 60- 90-day mortality , ICU in-hospital mortality , duration CRRT renal replacement therapy , duration mechanical ventilation , cytokine removal rate 12h initiation CRRT , change SOFA APACHE II score 72h initiation CRRT . This superiority trial aim demonstrate reduction 20 % mortality rate . For purpose , least 109 subject ( total 218 ) would require group type I error rate 5 % type II error 20 % give 25 % drop-out rate study period . Block randomization use mean dedicated website . There still conflict data optimal target dose CRRT patient septic AKI . Our study address issue answer unresolved question effect high dose CRRT .</brief_summary>
