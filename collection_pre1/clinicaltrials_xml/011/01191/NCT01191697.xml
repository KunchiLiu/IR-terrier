	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness combination chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , plus antibody bevacizumab trastuzumab . Trastuzumab ( also call Herceptin ) antibody attack HER2 protein tumor cell . Bevacizumab ( also call Avastin ) work slow stop growth cell cancer tumor decrease blood supply tumor . If blood supply decrease , oxygen nutrient need tumor growth decrease . The chemotherapy use trial call CAPOX , abbreviation capecitabine oxaliplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CAPOX , Bevacizumab Trastuzumab Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- We recommend participant vascular access device , commonly know PORT , insert prior start chemotherapy . A port small device insert skin ( usually near collar bone ) minor surgical procedure connect one large vein inside chest . The port use give intravenous medication . - During first cycle , participant receive trastuzumab intravenously Day 1 . Cycle 2 start one week later . On day , bevacizumab give intravenously first follow trastuzumab oxaliplatin . The participant start take capecitabine tablet orally twice day 14 day . Each treatment cycle 21 day long . - Participants follow test procedure specific time point study treatment ; physical exam , blood test , CT scan , MUGA scan echocardiogram , urine test .</detailed_description>
