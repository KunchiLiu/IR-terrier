	<criteria>1 . Provide sign date informed consent . The patient 's legally authorize representative ( LAR ) provide sign informed consent patient allow local Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee ( IRB/EC ) policy . 2 . Is ≥ 18 yrs age . 3 . If subject intravenous catheter place subject his/her primary health care provider must agree catheter remove within 5 day initial blood culture draw exception subject meet criterion simple CoNS bacteremia define Table 1 . The catheter may retain subject simple CoNS bacteremia . 4 . Has blood stream infection define least one blood culture positive S. aureus CoNS . In case , vancomycin ( study drug alternative ) start prior randomization . Enrollment windows depend speciation clinical classification follow : 1. identification CoNS classification simple per Table 1must randomize within 3 calendar day start treatment effective baseline infect pathogen 2. identification CoNS classification uncomplicated per Table 1 must randomize within 4 calendar day start treatment effective baseline infect pathogen 3. identification S. aureus must randomize within 12 calendar day start treatment effective baseline infect pathogen 5 . This criterion remove 6 . Women child bear potential must negative urine and/or serum pregnancy test . 7 . All patient reproductive potential must abstinent agree use doublebarrier contraception receive study ( algorithm base Standard Care ) therapy . 1 . Has know suspect new complicated staphylococcal infection time enrollment . 2 . Weigh ≥ 200 kg . 3 . Has nonremovable intravascular foreign material time positive blood culture drawn ( e.g. , intracardiac pacemaker cardioverter/defibrillator wire , hemodialysis access graft , cardiac prosthetic valve , valvular support ring ) . Exception : coronary stent , inferior vena cava ( IVC ) filter place &gt; 6 week , patient pacemaker whose baseline infect pathogen CoNS , vascular stent place &gt; 6 week , nonhemodialysis graft place &gt; 90 day hemodialysis graft use within past 12 month previously infect eligible randomization . Arthroplasties extravascular device , e.g . synthetic hernia repair mesh , nonarthroplasty orthopedic prosthesis include pin plate , acceptable long sign symptom foreign materialrelated infection time randomization . 4 . This criterion remove 5 . Has moribund clinical condition high likelihood death cardiac surgery next three day . 6 . Has shock hypotension ( supine systolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg ) oliguria ( urine output &lt; 20 mL/h ) unresponsive fluid pressor within four hour . 7 . Has receive investigational antibacterial agent antistaphylococcal activity within 30 day prior randomization . 8 . Has document history significant allergy intolerance protocolapproved antibiotic anticipated effective infection . 9 . Has infect pathogen confirm reduced susceptibility vancomycin ( Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations ( MIC ) &gt; 2 µg/mL ) know . Note : If reduce susceptibility vancomycin discover enrollment , patient treat daptomycin ( pathogen susceptible ) . Patient remain study appropriate evaluate Intent Treat ( ITT ) analysis , exclude Protocol Population ( PP ) analyse . 10 . For S. Aureus patient , severely neutropenic ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.100x103/mm3 ) anticipate develop severe neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.100x103/ mm3 ) study treatment period due prior plan chemotherapy . CoNS patient neutropenia eligible enrol . 11 . This criterion remove 12 . Has previously know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection nadir CD4+ count &lt; 100 cells/mm3 within past 12 month 13 . Is consider unlikely comply study procedure return schedule posttreatment evaluation . 14 . Is pregnant try get pregnant , nursing , lactate . 15 . Has know suspect septic arthritis , osteomyelitis , pneumonia metastatic focus infection . CoNS patient pneumonia treat anticipated start treatment antibiotic effective baseline infect pathogen include 16 . Has polymicrobial blood stream infection include least one nonstaphylococcal specie , except AFTER consultation Clinical Medical Monitor DCRI . Note possible subject may know polymicrobial bloodstream infection time randomization , additional pathogen ( ) subsequently isolate initial blood culture . These patient eligible remain trial . Please also note patient S. aureus plus CoNS follow treatment pathway S. aureus . 17 . This criterion remove . 18 . Is hemodialysis dependent end stage renal disease ( Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) &lt; 30 cc/min ) . 19 . Developed Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection within 72 hour percutaneous coronary revascularization 20 . Received follow antibiotic 7 10 calendar day immediately precede calendar day initial positive blood culture drawn : 1 . If methicillin susceptibility isolate unknown time enrollment : vancomycin ; daptomycin ; telavancin ; tigecycline ; linezolid ( either oral IV administration ) ; quinupristin/dalfopristin ; piperacillin/tazobactam ; penicillin ; nafcillin ; oxacillin ; cloxacillin ; cefazolin , ceftriaxone , ceftaroline , dalbavancin , oritavancin , tedizolid , levofloxacin equivalent fluoroquinolone ( either oral IV administration ) Note : ciprofloxacin exclusion criterion . 2 . If staphylococcal isolate know methicillin resistant : vancomycin ; daptomycin ; telavancin ; tigecycline ; linezolid ( either oral IV administration ) , quinupristin/dalfopristin , dalbavancin , oritavancin , tedizolid , ceftaroline . Note : patient develop bacteremia least 7 day prophylaxis oral antibiotic definition fail prophylaxis oral antibiotic deem noneffective index bacteremia . Oral antibiotic fail prophylaxis manner consider exclusionary count towards number antibiotic day must stop upon randomization 21 . Has previously participate study .</criteria>
