	<brief_title>Manually Versus Digitally Fabricated Removable Partial Dentures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The classic removable partial denture ( RPD ) denture fabricate CrCo use `` lose wax '' technique . This hand-made way work make final result vulnerable , always predictable reproducible . Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Manufacturing ( CAD/CAM ) technique introduce dentistry , particularly fabricate crown bridge ( fix partial denture ) . There little research field removable partial framework fabrication . This may part attribute lack suitable dedicate software . In technical part study , exist software hardware adjust maximize automation application computer-aided technology survey digital cast pattern design subsequent production sacrificial pattern use removable partial ( RP ) technology . In clinical trial CAD/CAM fabricate RPD 's evaluated cast clinically compare traditional fabricate RPD 50 consecutive patient . For every patient , two RPDs make material ( CrCo ) .The clinical parameter ( fit , stability , retention , support , friction ) double blind evaluate two dentist . At end treatment , patient choose one . Both RPDs fabricate time frame fabrication `` classic '' RPD . There patient extra session schedule . During 5 year patient follow-up program order judge long-term stability , loss retention , fracture , … group denture . Hypothesis1 : CAD/CAM fabricate RPD 's meet clinical standard RPD 's . Hypothesis 2 : Dentists observe difference classic CAD/CAM fabricate RPD . Hypothesis 3 : Patients see/feel difference classic CAD/CAM fabricate RPD .</detailed_description>
