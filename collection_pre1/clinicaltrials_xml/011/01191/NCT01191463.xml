	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency estimate affect one fifth world 's population , woman child among severely affect . Evidence mount iron deficiency anemia adversely affect brain development measurable effect child 's behavior , motor development cognition . In Hisar district Haryana state , north- India , 58 % school age child ( 6-10 year ) anemic , 49 % iron deficient whereas 40 % find anemic due iron deficiency . Iron bioavailability calculate use algorithms regional diet range 3.2 4.6 percent . Mungbean ( Vigna radiata L. ) third important legume crop India . It high potential legume crop 4-8 mg iron know nutritious healthy legume . Ascorbic acid potent enhancer iron absorption human counteract inhibitory effect phytic acid polyphenols . Guava popular easily available fruit community 200- 300 mg/100g ascorbic acid . We conduct randomise controlled trial school age child ( 6-10 year ) Haryana state India , determine efficacy local vitamin-C rich fruit guava mungbean base meal iron status rural Indian child . Objective : To assess effect mungbean base test meal iron status ( body iron store , define calculate ratio serum ferritin serum transferrin receptor ) school age child ( 6-10 year ) without consumption guava , vitamin C rich fruit , school feed program seven month . Study population : Three hundred school child age 6-10 year recruit two government school Mangali village situate Hisar district Haryana state . Study design : This intervention study carry randomize control design . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome measurement body iron store ( mg/kg body weight ) base ratio serum transferrin receptor serum ferritin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Local Vitamin-C Rich Fruit ( Guava ) Improving Iron Absorption From Mungbean Based Meals Its Effect Iron Status Rural Indian Children ( 6-10 Years )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective To measure effect mungbean base test meal iron status ( define body iron store , calculate ratio ferritin serum transferrin receptor ) school age child ( 6-10 year ) without consumption guava , vitamin C rich fruit , distribute school feed program seven month . Three week trial available child ( 6-10 year ) select school screen eligibility study basis medical health questionnaire . Deworming do least 20 day start feed trial single dose Albendazole ( 400 mg ) , give three month . These 300 child assign three group ( 100 child group ) . Group-1 serve normal school feed program ( SFP ) meal ( see annexure-1 ) group also serve control group study . Group-2 serve mungbean test meal ( see annexure-2 ) group-3 serve guava fruit addition mungbean test meal . Meals child provide six day week seven month . All meal serve mid morning ( 11.00 11.30 ) . Effect intervention assess term iron status child . This study carry two government school Mangali village belong Hisar-1 block Hisar district Haryana state close supervision Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University , Hisar . Children severe anemia ( Hb &lt; 7.0 g/dl ) exclude trial refer medical treatment . Subjects recruit comply follow criterion : - School child ( 6-10 ) year age , - enrol select primary school , - Informed consent obtain least one parent guardian , - Children apparently healthy ; i.e . pre-existing medical condition receive chronic medication , - Should allergic / hypersensitive ingredient test meal , Should consume mineral/vitamin supplement . - If child consume supplement he/she ask stop take supplement two week study study . A total two blood sample take participant , one start study , second end study . With sample 7ml blood take experienced technician . Blood always draw morning 7.30 9.00am particular school well trained technician . Hemoglobin whole blood , serum ferritin ( Sf ) , serum transferrin receptor ( sTfR ) , serum CRP AGP analyse compare iron status . Body iron store calculate formula Cook et . al . All analysis carry time sample baseline intervention St. John hospital , Bangalore . Therefore serum sample baseline store seven month - 800c temperature . The CV intra-assays inter-assays , monitor . Blood sample destroy completion study keep 5 year . Iron status compare child belong three different group pre post condition , use mention iron status indicator . Height weight child also measure pre post intervention study . The primary outcome study body iron store calculate cook formula . Secondary outcome prevalence iron deficiency , anaemia , difference haemoglobin concentration plasma concentration ferritin , soluble transfer receptor two treatment group . Anemia define hemoglobin concentration &lt; 11.5g/L iron deficiency define SF concentration &lt; 12Âµg/l . The cut-off normal CRP AGP define &lt; 5mg/L &lt; 1g/L ( 12 ) , respectively . Anthropometric index calculate use WHO ( 2006 ) ( 10 ) Child growth standard . Being stunt , underweight waste defined Z score &lt; -2SD height-for-age , weight-for-age weight-for-height respectively .</detailed_description>
