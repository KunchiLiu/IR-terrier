	<brief_title>Effectiveness Atropine Glycopyrrolate Reduce Hyper Salivation With Ketamine Sedation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ketamine common sedation agent use pediatric emergency department variety procedure , use clinical practice since 1970 . One potential side effect Ketamine hypersalivation , potentially leading laryngospasm . To prevent hypersalivation ( reduce potential laryngospasm ) , anti-salivary agent , Atropine , commonly give combination Ketamine . Recently , however , necessity practice bring question . The consideration use different drug , glycopyrrolate , debate . The purpose study compare effectiveness medication addition placebo control . Patients enrol study must present emergency department abscess clinic need receive Ketamine part sedation procedure ( determined treat physician ) . This study randomize enrolled patient receive double-blinded Atropine , Glycopyrrolate placebo give 30 minute prior Ketamine . After Ketamine administer , train medical person suction patient 's mouth every 5 minute total 30 minute , collect oral secretion . Total saliva production measure salivary flow rate calculate compare assign group . Adverse event complication monitor throughout patient 's stay emergency department abscess clinic .</detailed_description>
