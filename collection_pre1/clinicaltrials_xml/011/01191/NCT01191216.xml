	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose give 1-methyl-d-tryptophan docetaxel together treat patient metastatic solid tumor . Biological therapy , 1-methyl-d-tryptophan , may stop growth tumor cell stimulate immune system block enzyme need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving 1-methyl-d-tryptophan chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The MTD 1-MT/docetaxel combination use CTCAE 4.0 criterion . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination PK data combination docetaxel plus oral 1-MT.Overall objective response rate ( CR , PR ) per RECIST criterion . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oral 1-methyl-d-tryptophan twice daily day 1-21 docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 ( course one patient receive 1-methyl-d-tryptophan daily day 1 3-21 ) . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic correlative study .</detailed_description>
