	<brief_summary>Study design : -The study phase I like study assess extent prostate HistoScanning ( PHS , index test ) identify characterize focus prostate cancer compare histological sample harvest radical prostatectomy ( reference test ) . The study comprise 3 step : first , define suitable method match TRUS ( TransRectalUltrasonography ) histology ( step 1 ) ; second , refine algorithm ( train set ) ; third , verification PHS performance ( test set ) . Study objective : - Primary Objective : - To evaluate extent PHS discriminate malignant lesion prostate versus non-malignant tissue 3D RF TRUS data use radical prostatectomy histological step section reference test . - Secondary Objectives : - To adapt refine PHS tissue characterisation algorithm use RF data previously develop use grey-level data input . - To assess accuracy PHS predicting volume prostate cancer determine histology . - To assess ability PHS rule rule presence cancer &gt; = 0.5 cc &gt; = 0.2 cc determine histology . - To evaluate ability discriminate primary Gleason pattern 4 5 versus 3 less tumour &gt; = 0.5 cc &gt; = 0.2 cc . - To assess ability PHS correctly risk stratify patient .</brief_summary>
