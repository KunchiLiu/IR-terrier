	<brief_summary>Background : Recent single arm study suggest partial breast irradiation ( PBI ) , deliver relatively short overall treatment time day , may effective alternative adjuvant whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) deliver number week . Several PBI modality technique investigate , include interstitial brachytherapy external beam radiation therapy , often give course one week twice daily outpatient treatment . One randomize study show equivalency WBI PBI use brachytherapy . There currently three large phase-III randomized study compare PBI WBI . Permanent Breast Seed Implant ( PBSI ) new PBI technique pilot Odette Cancer Centre ( OCC ) Toronto . The main advantage technique require one out-patient procedure . The treatment administer implant radioactive Palladium ( 103Pd ) seed tumor bed region 1 Â½ hour outpatient procedure , patient discharge home resume normal living activity . This PBI procedure show well tolerate minimal acute toxicity . Estimated partner radiation exposure well within internationally acceptable level . Subjects seroma &gt; 2cm , however , exclude . Hypothesis : PBSI feasible , safe , acceptable treatment option subject partner context medical practice resource BC . Objectives : In subject undergone breast conserving surgery early breast cancer : 1 . To determine technical feasibility PBSI BC 2 . To measure subject 's partner term radiation protection 3 . To evaluate acceptability PBSI subject 4 . To assess resource requirement PBSI Method : This single arm feasibility study . Five woman undergone breast conserving surgery breast cancer low risk local recurrence accrue . This study adhere detail write protocol radiation measurement protection . Subjects undergo PBSI within 4-14 week last breast surgery . The procedure perform outpatient setting , conscious sedation local anesthesia , team wide brachytherapy experience . The technique use feasibility study base OCC technique . It intend two oncologist one physicist spend 2-3 day OCC acquire detailed firsthand knowledge technique implement centre . The OCC technique US-based ; study , however , additional CT-assisted planning component investigate building experience VIC team conduct BC Cancer Agency Vancouver Island Centre 's pilot study CT-based multi-catheter brachytherapy PBI . Systemic therapy accord BCCA guideline ; however , subject require adjuvant chemotherapy exclude study . Subjects follow prospectively 5 year evaluation toxicity , QOL cosmesis . Disease status record . Relevance : Completing adjuvant breast irradiation single out-patient treatment could significantly improve QOL convenience patient choose breast conserve therapy . Confirming technical feasibility safety PBSI need progress large prospective evaluation novel adjuvant radiation therapy technique viable treatment option woman British Columbia .</brief_summary>
