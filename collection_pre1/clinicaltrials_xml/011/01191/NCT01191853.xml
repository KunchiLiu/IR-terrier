	<brief_summary>Background : - Seasonal influenza major health problem whose impact typically reduce vaccination . The H1N1 ( swine flu ) influenza virus emerge pathogen potential cause devastate illness even death come month . Currently , limit data cellular molecular immune response adult recipient either seasonal H1N1 influenza vaccine . Objectives : - To obtain blood nasal wash sample perform laboratory study characterize immune response healthy adult volunteer baseline immunization seasonal H1N1 influenza vaccine . Eligibility : - Adult employee least 18 year age NIH Clinical Center deem healthy brief medical history physical examination routine blood test . Design : - Before start influenza season , volunteer receive either seasonal influenza vaccine H1N1 vaccine become available . If H1N1 vaccine available start season , volunteer receive seasonal vaccine H1N1 vaccine . - Blood drawn 8-week period . Volunteers must eat anything 8 hour prior blood draw . The sequence blood draw follow : 2 week vaccination ; right vaccination ; 1 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 60 day vaccination . - Two four nasal washing collect nurse volunteer receive vaccination ( ) 28 day vaccination . - Prevaccine postvaccine blood nasal wash sample compare determine volunteer immune response . - Research sample store indefinitely use strictly laboratory experiment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Seasonal influenza major health problem whose impact typically reduce vaccination . The H1N1 ( swine flu ) influenza virus emerge pathogen potential cause devastate morbidity mortality come month . In June 2009 , World Health Organization declare H1N1 outbreak global pandemic . At present limited data cellular molecular immune response adult recipient either seasonal H1N1 influenza vaccine . Therefore Center Human Immunology , Autoimmunity , Inflammatory Diseases propose protocol design obtain blood healthy adult subject ( NIH employee ) prior vaccination various time point receive FDA-licensed seasonal H1N1 influenza vaccine . These sample use perform comprehensive detail analysis immune system baseline response vaccination . To knowledge , protocol first study characterize human cellular molecular immune system parameter , immunome , large number healthy adult ( NIH employee ) . This information may useful design new , effective vaccine prevent spread H1N1 influenza . The primary objective perform laboratory study characterize immune response healthy adult volunteer baseline immunization seasonal H1N1 influenza vaccine . Primary endpoint result research laboratory assessment . As sample store indefinitely , time frame primary endpoint indefinite .</detailed_description>
