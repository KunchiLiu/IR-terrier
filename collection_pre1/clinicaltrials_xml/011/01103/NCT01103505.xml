	<detailed_description>The overall objective two arm randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) determine home monitoring use comprehensive visual field telemedicine solution base ForeseeHome device AREDS2 ( refer ForeseeHome comprehensive solution ) participant high risk progression neovascular AMD improve detection progression choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) compare standard care . The primary outcome study present best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) time CNV diagnosis . Secondary outcome include time confirm CNV diagnosis , lesion size , lesion location ( extrafoveal , juxtafoveal , subfoveal ) , lesion type ( occult without classic , predominantly classic minimally classic ) , sensitivity specificity , BCVA follow three consecutive month treatment twelve month initial start CNV treatment intravitreal anti-VEGF agent use either ranibizumab bevacizumab . Outcomes ascertained via follow specific aim :</detailed_description>
