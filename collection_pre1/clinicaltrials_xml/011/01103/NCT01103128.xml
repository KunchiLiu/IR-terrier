	<brief_summary>The primary aim study determine mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 result different precancerous pathway pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) , suggest validated mouse model . Genomic DNA isolate normal tissue obtain patient underwent pancreatic resection PDAC , intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) mucinous cystic neoplasm ( MCN ) . Tissue examine three common founder mutation Ashkenazi Jews . In case BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation find , heterozygote normal abnormal tissue examine look mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 allele . The interaction cancer cause gene BRCA1/2 also evaluate compare sequence gene pre-cancerous lesion . We hypothesize BRCA1- BRCA2-mediated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progress PanIN route , see BRCA1 BRCA2 murine model pancreatic cancer . We hypothesize BRCA1 mutation may enable additional pre- neoplastic pathway MCN , IPMN may embody yet another pre- neoplastic pathway .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) fourth lead cause death malignancy United States . Several gene mutation cancer syndrome identify found great frequency individual PDAC , include breast ovary cancer syndrome ( BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation ) . We recently generate mouse model pancreatic cancer find deletion either BRCA1 BRCA2 cooperate K-ras activation p53 mutation increase rate tumorigenesis via accelerated progression Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia ( PanIN ) . However , BRCA1 deletion associate development concomitant Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms ( MCNs ) , suggest potentially distinct pathway BRCA1- BRCA2-mediated tumorigenesis pancreas . Our primary aim determine germline mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 result different pre-neoplastic pathway pancreatic cancer , murine model . Genomic DNA isolate normal tissue obtain patient underwent pancreatic resection pancreatic cancer , IPMN MCN . Tissue genotyped three common founder mutation Ashkenazi Jews . In case BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation find , heterozygote normal abnormal tissue microdissected look loss heterozygosity BRCA1 BRCA2 allele . Our secondary aim evaluate interaction p53 Kras BRCA1 BRCA2 sequence p53 Kras PanIN compare IPMN MCN lesion .</detailed_description>
