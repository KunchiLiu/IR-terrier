	<detailed_description>Peristomal skin problem report negative impact quality life people stoma cause one third visit stoma care nurse . Stoma effluent contact peristomal skin ( leakage ) appear predispose patient peristomal skin problem . To protect skin effluent , appliance use collection stoma effluent completely cover peristomal skin close stoma . Coloplast develop new base plate ( SSH ) improve security increase comfort minimize leakage ( seep base plate ) risk thereby also leakage relate peristomal skin problem . The purpose clinical study evaluate effect new base plate degree leakage base plate compare two exist base plat market . The study randomise control cross-over intervention study , study participant test three test product ( SSH , Conform 2 Sensura ) . Each test period last 14 day . If 4 change base plate obtain 14 day , test period prolong 4 base plate change obtain . However , max test period one type product 21 day . The participant visit study investigator study start every shift new type test product . At visit answer question test product , peristomal skin examination instruct use next test product next treatment period . Evaluation leakage handle occur via questionnaire participant take home . 80 healthy participant ileostomy include study .</detailed_description>
