	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , tremelimumab CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving tremelimumab together CD 40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870 , 893 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose give tremelimumab together CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893 treating patient metastatic melanoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerated dos tremelimumab ( administer intravenously every 12 week ) CP- 870,893 ( administer intravenously every 3 week ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I To seek preliminary evidence anti-tumor efficacy combination tremelimumab CP-870,893 , include objective response rate MTD . II . To determine immune pharmacodynamic change associate administration combination tremelimumab CP-870,893 . OUTLINE : Patients receive tremelimumab IV 1 hour day 1 CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893 IV 30 minute day 2 , 22 , 43 , 64 . Treatment repeat every 12 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
