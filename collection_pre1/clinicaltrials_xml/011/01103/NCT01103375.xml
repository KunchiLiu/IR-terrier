	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib hydrochloride give isotretinoin treat patient recurrent malignant glioma . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Isotretinoin may help cell involve body 's immune response work well . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together isotretinoin may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Isotretinoin Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) 13-cis-retinoic acid ( CRA ) administer adult recurrent malignant glioma receive cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess dose-related toxicity . II . To measure 6 month progression-free survival overall survival . III . To estimate response rate patient measurable disease . IV . To evaluate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) vIII , phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) , cyclin D1 , cyclin E , RARbeta1 expression tumor sample enrol patient predictor clinical benefit combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive isotretinoin orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
