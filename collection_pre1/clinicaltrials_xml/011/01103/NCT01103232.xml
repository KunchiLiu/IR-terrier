	<brief_summary>Previous study well document impact unilateral training limb muscle untrained contralateral homologous muscle . The aim study evaluate whether electrical muscle stimulation dominant wrist flexor 6 week cause increase muscle strength contralateral wrist extensor healthy adult men . Ethical approval obtain Institutional Review Board . All participant volunteer provide write informed consent . Among young adult male work hospital , 30 subject voluntarily accept participate study assess eligibility . Twenty three young-adult healthy male include double-blind prospective study . These volunteer randomize two group . In Electrical Muscle Stimulation ( EMS ) group , electrical muscle stimulation right wrist flexor muscle apply ; Controls , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation apply . Electrodes place flexor aspect right forearm group . Electrical stimulation apply thirty session ( one session day , five day week six week ) group researcher . Compex2 ( Medicompex SA , Switzerland ) use electrical stimulation . Isokinetic torque measure right left wrist flexor extensors trial . Isokinetic torque measure right ( train ) leave ( untrained ) forearm Cybex ( Humac 2004/Norm ) extremity-testing system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It report strength training unilateral limb cause increase voluntary strength train limb , also contralateral untrained limb . This phenomenon know `` cross-education , cross-training contralateral strength training effect '' . Cross-education muscle strength occur upper low limb muscles.It gender age specific occur training accomplish voluntary effort , electrical stimulation muscle mental practice unilateral contraction . Electrostimulation one efficient method induce cross-education . Although clear unilateral train contralateral effect , mechanisms behind effect remain unclear . Because specific nature cross education , modification neural function likely mechanism underlie effect . The potential neural mechanism broadly categorize either `` central '' `` peripheral ( spinal ) '' adaptation . Central neural mechanism involve excitation relevant part cortex voluntary contraction train limb thought produce contralateral facilitation . The cross-extension reflex primary spinal neural mechanism cross-education . In study perform today , contralateral effect unilateral training evaluate contralateral homologous muscle . However 's report whether change muscle strength observe antagonist contralateral homologous muscle . In study , one session unilateral surface electrical stimulation rectus femoris , increase isometric force EMG activity contralateral rectus femoris , decrease EMG activity contralateral biceps femoris report adult men . It 's propose , EMG activity decrease biceps femoris may explain cross-extension reflex . The effect long-time exercise electrical muscle stimulation antagonists contralateral homologous muscle clear . The aim study evaluate whether electrical muscle stimulation dominant wrist flexor 6 week cause increase muscle strength contralateral wrist extensor healthy adult men .</detailed_description>
