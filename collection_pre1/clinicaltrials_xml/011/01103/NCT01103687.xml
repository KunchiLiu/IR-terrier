	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response Adenovirus-Based HIV Vaccine HIV-Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Control global HIV pandemic require development safe effective vaccine . Many HIV preventive vaccine development use recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 ( rAd5 ) vector way deliver vaccine cell . However , majority people , particularly develop world , immunity Ad5 vector , mean vaccine effective preventing HIV infection . This study use rAd26 vector part HIV vaccine , research show relatively people immunity vector . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity rAd26 vector preventive HIV-1 vaccine . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected people . Participants randomly assign receive either rAd26 vaccine placebo vaccine . All vaccine inject upper arm . At vaccination study visit , participant undergo medical medication history review , physical examination , rectal sampling procedure . They receive assign vaccine . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic least 30 minute observation monitor side effect . Participants receive counsel HIV risk reduction pregnancy prevention . For 7 day vaccination , participant monitor temperature side effect . Additional study visit occur Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 , 61 , 168 , 365 . At visit , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , counseling , blood collection . At Day 14 168 visit , rectal sampling procedure perform . Participants attend study visit contact study researcher telephone e-mail 18 month receive vaccine follow-up health safety monitoring . Participants may elect attend optional follow-up visit blood collection Years 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 .</detailed_description>
