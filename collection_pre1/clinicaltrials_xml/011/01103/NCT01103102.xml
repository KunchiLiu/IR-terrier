	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore dose-response relationship Iocide oral rinse clinical trial gingivitis . Approximately sixty ( 60 ) otherwise healthy subject gingivitis randomize 3-month study provide 40 total evaluable subject ( 10 per group ) . Each study participant four visit : screen visit 21 day begin trial , baseline visit day 1 , visit week 8 12 . The duration dose/range study three month facilitate compliance ensure timely completion Phase II study . Three dose/regimens evaluate placebo control oral rinse . Indices gingivitis , plaque bleeding score blood test perform determine effect antimicrobial oral rinse relative level biological marker inflammation .</brief_summary>
