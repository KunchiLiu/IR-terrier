	<detailed_description>Participants recruit study use various method , include word mouth IRB-approved flyer post throughout treatment facility . Onsite study staff screen MA-dependent client private study office review informed consent protocol . After completion inform consent procedure , participant enter a1-2week screening phase determine eligibility , consist medical history , physical exam , laboratory study , ECG . Eligible client take study baseline assessment inform randomization study condition , either exercise intervention health education control , use computerized urn randomization program stratify client condition base gender ( male/female ) severity baseline MA use ( higher vs. low severity ) . The cut-off point determine low severity MA use versus high severity use identify use data previous clinical outcome study show median number day MA use range from16 20 day treatment entry . Hence , define `` low severity '' use MA 18 few day previous month , `` high severity '' use 19 day past month . The study 's data management center ( DMC ) maintain urn randomization program record link participant identification number study condition . Study intervention conduct onsite participant enrol usual care residential treatment facility ; case early discharge facility result premature termination study . Participants randomize exercise condition receive structured exercise program 3 time week 8 week . Exercise session consist 5-min warm-up , 30 min aerobic activity treadmill , follow 15 min weight train 5-min cool-down/stretching period . Each session monitor staff exercise physiologist guide one two participant time . Using heart rate monitor , exercise physiologist work closely individual participant exercise day increase treadmill speed/slope maintain heart rate 60 % 85 % maximum 30 minute . Once participant able complete two set 15 repetition give exercise , weight incrementally increase . A data collection protocol occur baseline , also weekly 8-week study period , termination study period , 1- , 3- , 6-months post treatment residential program ( approximately 7-10 day follow completion intervention period ) . Participants compensate $ 40 per data collection session .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Be seek treatment MA dependence ; 2 . Be 18 year age old , 45 young male , 55 young female ; 3 . Meet DSMIVTR criterion MA dependence ; 4 . Have vital sign within clinically acceptable normal range , e.g. , rest pulse 50 90 /min , blood pressure 85150mm Hg systolic 4590mm Hg diastolic ; 5 . Have medical history physical examination , judgment study physician Principal Investigator , show clinically significant contraindication study participation ; 6 . For female , provide negative pregnancy urine test randomization ( subsample , another negative test final PET scan conclusion intervention ) . 1 . Clinically significant heart disease hypertension ; unstable pulmonary cardiovascular disease would interfere participation exercise regimen 2 . Neurological psychiatric disorder assess MINI clinical interview , psychosis , bipolar illness , Tourette 's syndrome , major depression , organic brain disease , dementia , neuropsychiatric disorder would require ongoing treatment would make study compliance difficult ; 3 . Musculoskeletal disease would prevent participation exercise regimen 4 . Baseline ECG show evidence cardiac ischemia , arrhythmia , clinically significant abnormality 5 . Untreated unstable medical illness include : neuroendocrine , autoimmune , renal , hepatic , active infectious disease ( HIV ) require immediate medical attention ; 6 . Clinically significant abnormality hematology chemistry laboratory test may make participation hazardous ; 7 . Have HIV unable obtain clearance participation his/her AIDS medical care provider ; 8 . Pregnant ; 9 . Any illness , condition , use medication , opinion PI and/or study physician , would preclude safe participation completion study .</criteria>
