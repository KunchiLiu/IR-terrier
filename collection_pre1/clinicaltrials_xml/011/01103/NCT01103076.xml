	<brief_summary>In study , investigator evaluate whether CD4+ TCM produce effector cytokine distinguish basis expression IL-7 receptor alpha-chain ( CD127 ) . Using CD154 production marker Ag-specific CD4+ T cell , investigator also test hypothesis phenotype function TCM influence type Ag recognize . TCM specific two cleared protein Ag , tetanus toxo√Ød ( TT ) hepatitis B surface ( HBs ) , induce early stage CD4+ T cell differentiation compare TCM specific cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , persistent virus induce advanced stage CD4+ T cell differentiation . The primary endpoint demonstrate uremic patient begin chronic HD patient already chronically hemodialyzed improvement CD4+ T cell function ex vivo vitro . These analyzes focus memory T-cell subset ( i.e . Th17 Tregs population ) use HCO membrane polyamide dialyzer . The secondary endpoint clinical one , namely , show improvement T cell response HB TT vaccination ( blood antibody titer ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hemodialysis ( HD ) associate change T cell immunity also lipid profile . Apart immune function , circulate T cell may participate actively atherogenesis , treatment aim reduce T cell activation apoptosis patient ESRD reduce risk development cardiovascular disease . Evidence exist HD patient expose enhanced oxidative stress initiate generation oxygen free radical , mainly tissue probably circulation . The potent O2-generating protein oxidatively modify lipoprotein , mainly oxidize ( oxLDL ) . OxLDL show trigger apoptosis endothelial cell , macrophage , lymphocyte . However , pathophysiological relevance oxLDL-induced CD4+ T cell apoptosis HD patient remain uncertain . Previous finding include suggest chronic HD patient , significantly high percentage activate CD4+ T cell ultimately proliferate become apoptotic . The induction activate CD4+ T cell apoptosis HD patient dependent Fas/FasL expression , lead cell contact form circulate CD4+ T cell self-injury . Furthermore , investigator show activated CD4+ T cell patient fail respond adequately exogenous IL-2 . This due downmodulation surface IL-2 receptor ( IL-2R ) beta gamma subunit expression , impaired IL-2 signal transduction CD4+ T cell , and/or increase serum level soluble IL-2R ( sIL-2R ) . Moreover , vivo sensitization IL-2 low synthesis endogenous IL-2 , potentially may lead enhanced sensitivity T cell apoptosis . Decreased proliferative capacity CD69+/CD4+ T cell individual normal renal function incubate serum chronic HD patient restoration normal serum strongly suggest mediator induce HD affect transduction mechanisms IL-2/IL-2R pathway . Finally , IL-2 seem inhibit apoptotic process many stage interact various protein . Therefore , investigator postulate , HD patient , oxidative stress induce oxLDL may increase CD4+ T cell sensitivity Fas-mediated apoptosis , part consequence HD patient 's specific dysregulation IL-2 expression . To test hypothesis , investigator assess role Fas IL-2 mediate oxLDL-induced CD4+ T cell dysfunction patient ESRD . Recently , Meier et al . show HD patient exhibit reduction number peripheral Tregs , show reduce suppressor function . Considering oxLDL effect , relative percentage Tregs total CD4 population significantly reduce incubation oxLDL compare nonsignificant deplete effect CD4+/CD25- T cell . The author suggest oxLDL specific role Tregs . More interestingly , Tregs HD patient exhibit early cell-cycle arrest become apoptotic . These phenomena consequence oxLDL-inhibited proteasome proteolytic activity p27Kip1 Bax proteins , accumulate PHA-stimulated Tregs vitro . Thus , plasma oxLDL uremic patient might trigger Tregs cycle arrest apoptosis proteasome alteration . Furthermore , find uremic serum HD patient oxLDL trigger time- concentration-dependent down-regulatory effect expression FOXP3 . This mean circulate Tregs HD patient , addition reduce number , also express low level FOXP3 per cell , thus fail suppress proliferation effector cell . In study , investigator want use gene protein expression profile functional assay human ( ESKD patient chronic HD naive uremic patient yet HD ) CD4+ TCM identify mechanism underlie maintenance dysfunction . Our result provide molecular basis capacity CD4+ TCM resist apoptosis persist stable manner host , thereby confer long-term protective immunity reinfection . To test hypothesis , important determine whether TCM produce cytokine represent distinct subset memory cell express specific differentiation phenotype . To part investigator analyse role play Tregs uremic patient use new membrane , namely HCO 1100 .</detailed_description>
