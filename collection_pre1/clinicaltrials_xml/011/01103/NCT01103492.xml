	<brief_summary>This study involve evaluate procedure study device , HALO90 Ablation catheter , use heat thin layer tissue line rectum use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy subject suffer radiation proctitis ( acute inflammation inner line rectum cause side effect radiation treatment lead bleed ) . In medical procedure , RF energy use device , historically use shrink remove soft-tissue , surgical cutting , stop bleeding . The device clear Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use coagulation ( assit stop bleed clot blood ) tissue within digestive tract . The device use area outside esophagus ( inner line throat ) , include rectum treat radiation proctitis . The stoppage bleed radiation proctitis , use HALO device , may one method control bleed . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness record result treatment radiation proctitis use HALO device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study intend prospectively gather information regard performance endoscope-mounted radiofrequency ( RF ) energy device , utilizes RF energy coagulation gastrointestinal tissue set bleed radiation proctitis . The study device , HALO90 Ablation catheter , FDA 510 ( k ) clearance human use . The study design single-site , prospective clinical trial gather performance data regard 510 ( k ) -cleared , endoscopically-guided radiofrequency energy ablation device coagulation hemorrhagic radiation proctitis . Study subject experience bloody stool due proctitis follow pelvic radiation cancer prostate uterine endometrium . The study include female male adult patient receive pelvic radiotherapy indication cancer prostate endometrium subsequently experience recurrent hemorrhagic radiation proctitis . As part protocol , focal area epithelial line diseased colon , rectum , and/or anus treat study device . The aim obtain information hemostatic effect device . The treatment setting evaluate study previously establish device esophagus `` treat resect '' protocol , well clinical trial Barrett 's esophagus long-term follow-up .</detailed_description>
