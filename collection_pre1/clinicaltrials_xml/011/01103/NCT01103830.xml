	<detailed_description>The fight malaria , WHO reactivate 1999 Roll Back Malaria programme , emphasize early curative treatment malaria , particularly child , order decrease mortality morbidity . Recent estimate confirm disturb persistence endemic malaria around 515 million case 1.0 million death per year.The available range standard antimalarial drug narrow . There four class compound , probably different mechanism action : 4-aminoquinolines , amino-alcohols , artemisinin derivative ( isolated plant , Artemisia annua ) , antifolates drug relate . From public health perspective , drug resistance critical factor undermines malaria control.Plasmodium falciparum resistance chloroquine sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine widespread . At present , natural quinine still effective P. falciparum everywhere world except partially South-east Asia South America , decrease susceptibility report . Only artemisinin derivative , use 15 year Asia , recently Africa , generate clinical resistance . Overcoming reduce resistance require adoption several strategy ; central use effective chemotherapy need . In addition , new molecule , need develop implement strategy protect drug resistance . Resistance single-drug therapy inevitably occur . Drug combination , standard practice viral bacterial disease , adopt malaria well . The artemisinin derivatives combination standard antimalarial promote best therapeutic option treat drug-resistant malaria retard development resistance . The aim present study investigate effect new Artemisinin Combination Therapy ( ACT ) formulation electrocardiographic parameter . In literature relevant QT prolongation associate Piperaquine treatment report not-company sponsored trial specific TQT trial publish . On contrary report quinine , quinidine halofantrine induce QT prolongation ( slight severe ) .</detailed_description>
