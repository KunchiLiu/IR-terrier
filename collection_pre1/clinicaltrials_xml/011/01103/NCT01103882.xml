	<detailed_description>This study evaluate incidence dislocation short-term clinical outcome patient undergo large diameter 4th generation ceramic bearing total hip Arthroplasty ( `` THA '' ) comparison historical data 3rd generation CoC THA ( 28mm ) patient . Specifically study intend address follow research topic : 1 . The incidence dislocation THA use 4th generation Ceramic Bearing comparison 3rd generation Ceramic Bearing . 2 . The incidence ceramic fracture THA use 4th generation Ceramic Bearing comparison 3rd generation Ceramic Bearing 3 . The survival rate , wear rate , incidence osteolysis THA use 4th generation Ceramic Bearing 4 . Range motion improvement preoperative postoperative support Korean sit style THA use 4th generation Ceramic Bearing . 5 . Clinical outcome , activity level QoL patient use 4th generation Ceramic Bearing . 6 . The performance THA use new ceramic bearing mostly patient young 50 year .</detailed_description>
