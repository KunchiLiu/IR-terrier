	<brief_title>Manual Therapy Effectiveness Comparison With Electric Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) Patients With Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose ti study evaluate effectiveness manual therapy ( MT ) Electric Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) reduce pain intensity patient mechanical neck disorder ( MND ) . Design : randomize multi-centered controlled clinical trial . Location : 12 Primary Care Physiotherapy Units Madrid Region . Ninety patient include diagnosis subacute chronic MND without neurological damage , 47 patient receive MT 43 TENS . The primary outcome pain intensity measure millimeter use Visual Analogue Scale . Also disability , quality life , adverse effect sociodemographic prognosis variable measure . Three evaluation perform ( , procedure finish six month ) . Seventy one patient ( 79 % ) complete follow-up measurement six month . In half treated patient procedure clinically relevant `` short term '' result end intervention , either MT TENS use . The success rate decrease one third patient 6 month intervention . No difference find reduction pain , decrease disability quality life therapy . Both analyzed physiotherapy technique produce short term pain reduction clinically relevant .</detailed_description>
