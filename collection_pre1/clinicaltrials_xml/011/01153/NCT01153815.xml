	<brief_summary>This trial multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study compare GSK1358820 ( Botulinum Toxin Type A , also know `` OnabotulinumtoxinA '' `` Botox '' ) placebo efficacy safety treatment poststroke subject focal wrist , finger case , thumb spasticity . Approximately 168 subject enrol . Subjects receive single treatment session intramuscular GSK1358820 ( Botulinum Toxin Type A , also know `` OnabotulinumtoxinA '' `` Botox '' ) '200U 240U ( thumb spasticity present ) ' placebo randomization ratio 1:1 . The subject observe 12 week post injection . Outcome measure include change baseline every post injection visit measure Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) , Disability Assessment Scale ( DAS ) Global Assessment Scale . The primary efficacy endpoint change baseline week 6 wrist flexor muscle tone measure Modified Ashworth Scale . Safety parameter also measure include adverse event , vital sign ( pulse blood pressure ) clinical laboratory test ( haematology , serum chemistry urinanalysis ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective study confirm superior efficacy single treatment session GSK1358820 ( Botulinum Toxin Type A , aslo know `` OnabotulinumtoxinA '' `` Botox '' ) '200U 240U ( thumb spasticity present ) ' placebo subject post-stroke upper limb spasticity wrist finger flexor measure Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . This trial multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group study compare GSK1358820 ( Botulinum Toxin Type A , also know `` OnabotulinumtoxinA '' `` Botox '' ) placebo treatment subject focal wrist , finger case , thumb spasticity post-stroke . Approximately 168 subject enrol . Subjects receive single treatment session intramuscular injection GSK1358820 ( Botulinum Toxin Type A , also know `` OnabotulinumtoxinA '' `` Botox '' ) '200U 240U ( thumb spasticity present ) ' placebo randomization ration 1:1 . The subject observe 12 week post injection . Each complete subject attend 7 clinic visit . The maximum study duration 13 week per subject . The study include 1 week pretreatment period , screen visit ( visit 1 ) take place . Only one upper limb ( meet inclusion/exclusion criterion ) evaluate treat study . Subjects receive single intramuscular treatment either investigated drug placebo day 0 ( visit 2 ) . There five post-injection follow-up visit week 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 ( visit 3 7 ) . Week 6 ( visit 5 ) designate primary visit determine efficacy . The primary endpoint change baseline week 6 wrist flexor muscle tone measure Modified Ashworth Scale ( MAS ) . The secondary endpoint include The secondary endpoint include area curve ( AUC ) MAS wrist score change baseline , change baseline wrist/finger/thumb flexor muscle tone measure MAS , Disability Assessment Scale Global Assessment Scale . The safety measure include adverse event , clinical laboratory test pulse , blood pressure .</detailed_description>
