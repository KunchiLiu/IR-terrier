	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study vorinostat treat patient stage IV breast cancer receive aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) therapy . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vorinostat may also help AI therapy work well make tumor cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer Receiving Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine rate clinical benefit ( objective response plus stable disease ) patient treat cycle consist 2 week vorinostat follow 6 week AI therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability vorinostat patient metastatic breast cancer . II . Assess change estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression , measure change fluoroestradiol standard uptake value ( FES SUV ) use fluoroestradiol-positron emission tomography ( FES-PET ) complete per protocol 7184 two week vorinostat therapy 8 week therapy . III . Assess tumor metabolic response , measure change fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) SUV use FDG PET complete per protocol 7184 two week vorinostat therapy 8 week therapy . IV . Assess change hormone level ( estradiol , estrone , follicle-stimulating hormone [ FSH ] , sex binding globulin , testosterone , free testosterone ) 8 week therapy . V. Assess change ER , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , androgen receptor ( AR ) , epithelial growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) tumor expression two week vorinostat therapy patient consent optional tissue biopsy procedure . VI . Assess time progression overall survival patient treat cycle 2 week vorinostat follow 6 week AI . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 2 week follow AI therapy comprise anastrozole PO QD , letrozole PO QD , OR exemestane PO QD 6 week . Courses repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month disease progression , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
