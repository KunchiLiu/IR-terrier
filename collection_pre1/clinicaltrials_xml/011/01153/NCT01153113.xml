	<brief_summary>The purpose research develop new powerful type immune therapy prostate cancer patient . This therapy involve vaccination special stimulator cell find human body call dendritic cell . These dendritic cell take protein release cancer cell present piece proteins immune cell call T lymphocytes create strong stimulatory signal fight cancer . One proteins call telomerase , find prostate cancer critically important prostate cancer cell grow . However , cancer patient , immune system adequately destroy tumor T cell stimulate sufficiently . T cell require strong stimulation grow become active cancer cell . We discover substance call ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , carry genetic instruction production telomerase , use overcome problem stimulate strong immune response cancer patient . In order test hypothesis design clinical study enroll patient metastatic prostate cancer express telomerase order determine whether vaccine stimulate T cell , recognize kill prostate tumor cell . The main objective study find whether injection dendritic cell grow blood cell `` pulse '' ( mixed together short period time ) RNA derive patient 's tumor : 1 . Safe without induce major side effect . 2 . And effective boosting patient body 's immunity telomerase express prostate cancer cell . 3 . Finally , test whether tumor shrinkage base serum PSA level X-ray study occur . We hope new form immune therapy , although infancy , ultimately slow tumor growth prolong survival prostate cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Messenger RNA ( hTERT mRNA ) Transfected Dendritic Cell Vaccines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective trial include evaluate safety biologic efficacy hTERT mRNA transfected dendritic cell ( DC ) , apply prime-boost format , stimulate hTERT-specific CD4+ CD8+ T-cell responses subject metastatic prostate cancer . Secondary objective include estimate objective clinical response , duration response , progression-free survival overall survival among subject . The hTERT mRNA-transfected DC vaccine platform previously study several phase I/II trial demonstrate safety bioactivity subject metastatic prostate renal cell carcinoma . The objective trial enhance observe bioactivity vaccine use prime-boost strategy . This open label , uncontrolled safety efficacy study . Subjects metastatic prostate cancer eligible study receive 1x107 cell administer ID study week 1,2,3,4,5 , 6 ( Prime ) . Thereafter , subject randomize equal probability receive either 5x106 cell administer ID study week 10 follow monthly immunization ( Treatment arm A ) 1x107 cell administer ID study week 10 follow monthly immunization ( Treatment arm B ) . The safety , biologic clinical efficacy regimen analyze . The study solely conduct University Florida Gainesville , FL . Subjects recruit oncology clinic Departments Urology Radiation Oncology . The vaccine manufacture dedicated GMP-compliant cell production facility locate 4th floor Cancer Genetics Research Institute . Immunological test perform Immunological Monitoring Core laboratory Department Urology use standardized assay system . Subjects histologically clinically confirm metastatic prostate cancer ( stag pT1-4 , N0-3 , M+ ) eligible study . Subjects treat medical hormone ablative therapy ( LHRH analogues estrogen ) continue receive LHRH analogue . In subject receive nonsteroidal medical hormonal treatment ( i.e . flutamide bicalutamide ) experience rise PSA , 4 week period observation require following discontinuation nonsteroidal antiandrogen prior study entry . Subjects exclude study receive chemotherapy form immunotherapy 4 week prior study entry . They must history autoimmune disease , serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , pulmonary disease , active hepatitis , serologic evidence HIV , receive corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy . All subject must older 18 year . This randomized phase II clinical trial , 36 subject randomize equal probability one two treatment arm . The objective trial decide two treatment regimen select test . Hence , primary objective trial select arm high biologic response first rank arm select study large efficacy trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologically clinically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate either : metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma , Stage ( T14 , N+ , M0 ) ( T14 , N03 , M+ ) OR two document rise PSA level maintain LHRH analogue . Subjects receive nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy must discontinue therapy 4 week prior study entry . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) great equal 80 % Age ≥ 18 year Adequate hematologic function : WBC ≥ 3000 mm3 hemoglobin ≥ 9 mg/dl platelet ≥ 100,000/mm3 • Adequate renal hepatic function : serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl • Adequate coagulation parameter : Prothrombin Time &lt; 1.5 x control Partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.5 x control • Ability understand provide sign inform consent fulfill Institutional Review Board guideline . Subjects receive radiation therapy within 4 week pretreatment evaluation . ( There must least 12 week prior therapy include 89Strontium prior therapy study entry . ) Subjects receive chemotherapy biologic regimen within 4 week pretreatment evaluation . Subjects receive immunotherapy within 4 week pretreatment evaluation . Subjects recover radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy toxicity . Subjects either previously irradiate new CNS ( central nervous system ) metastases . ( Preenrollment head CT require . ) Subjects history autoimmune disease , restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Subjects serious intercurrent chronic acute illness pulmonary ( asthma COPD ) cardiac ( NYHA class III IV ) hepatic disease illness consider P.I . constitute unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment . Medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol . Concurrent second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer , control superficial bladder cancer . In event prior malignancy treat surgically , subject must consider NED ( evidence disease ) minimum 3 year prior enrollment . Presence active acute chronic infection , include symptomatic urinary tract infection , HIV ( determine ELISA confirm Western Blot ) viral hepatitis ( determine HBsAg Hepatitis C serology ) . Subjects steroid therapy ( immunosuppressive agent azathioprine cyclosporine A ) exclude basis potential immune suppression . Subjects must 4 week discontinuation steroid therapy prior enrollment .</criteria>
