	<detailed_description>Study Design This pilot study determine safety feasibility lentivirus-transduced T cell immunotherapy patient fail highly active anti-retrovirus therapy ( HAART ) define HIV level intolerance drug therapy . The lentivirus vector induce 3 form anti-HIV RNA : RNAi form short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) target exon HIV-1 tat/rev ( shI ) , decoy HIV TAT-activated RNA ( TAR ) , ribozyme target host T cell CCR5 cytokine receptor ( CCR5RZ ) . The vector call rHIV7-shI-TAR-CCR5RZ use transduction expansion autologous CD4-enriched T cell . Doses 1 x 109 T cell give 0 , +6 , +12 week first cohort 3 subject . Following completion cohort , serious adverse event occur within 3 week last infusion , next cohort receive 10 x 109 T cell 0 , +6 , +12 week use 8 week space subject . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint pilot study patient safety study feasibility . Safety determine clinical laboratory observation grade adverse event , analysis T cell repertoire clonality , evaluation HIV isolate evidence vector recombination . Feasibility determine ability obtain suitable number expand T cell expression RNA transgenes cell . The secondary endpoint duration T cell circulation blood post-infusion effect T cell infusion CD4 count HIV load . Conventional CD4 count HIV RNA level blood determine follow-up interval . Subject Eligibility Number . Subjects must HIV-1 infect adult ≥18 ≤60 year age HAART therapy least one year evidence virologic failure define &gt; 5000 HIV RNA genome copy ( gc ) per mL blood . Subjects must CD4 count least 200 CD4+ T cells/mL . This pilot study expect accrue five evaluable patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient must : Be Age ≥ 18 year ≤ 60 year . Be HIV seropositive treat potent antiretroviral chemotherapy regimen least one year HIV plasma RNA &gt; 5000 gc/ml . Have available genotypic evidence resistance prior HAART modification must consistent current recommendation . Have CD4 count &gt; 200 cells/mL CD4/CD8 ratio &gt; 0.2 , hemoglobin , WBC , platelet count within 1.5x normal limit . Have Karnofsky performance status &gt; /= 70 % . Have pretreatment SGOT , SGPT , serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) extrinsic hepatobiliary disease HBV surface antigen hepatitis C virus antibody . Have PT/PTT &lt; 2 time ULN . Have serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN . Females Only : Must pregnant base pregnancy test within past 7 day . Have CD4 count ≤ 200 , patient prophylactic regimen pneumocystis pneumonia agree begin treatment . Agree use effective birth control prevent pregnancy . Voluntarily consent comply treatment required test . Patients ineligible : The patient active bacterial fungal infection . The patient successfully treat AIDS relate opportunistic infection within past year . The patient active CMV retinitis active CMVrelated organ dysfunction ( exclude completely treat CMV infection ) . The patient evidence clinically significant neuropathy . The patient relapse pneumocystis carinii pneumonia within past year . The patient intractable severe diarrhea define &gt; 1500 cc diarrheal fluid per day diarrhea cause persistent severe electrolyte abnormality hypoalbuminemia . The patient AIDSrelated syndrome , infection illness would preclude autologous HCT determine Principle Investigator . The patient take immunosuppressive medication past 30 day . Has prior malignancy , except treat curative intent five year treatment , cervical anal squamous cell cancer superficial basal cell squamous cell cancer skin . The patient autoantibody . The patient leukapheresis past 3 month . The patient know allergy human serum albumin , Dextran 40 DMSO . The patient ever gene therapy trial .</criteria>
