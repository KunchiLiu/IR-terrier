	<brief_summary>GSK1360707 potent re-uptake inhibitor neurotransmitter dopamine , norepinephrine serotonin . This single dose PET study healthy subjects.A final analysis safety data follow exposure single oral dos , first time human study , GSK1360707 demonstrate compound well tolerate dose 150mg . This imaging study open label , non-randomised PET occupancy study use healthy male volunteer . The degree time course DAT SERT occupancy GSK1360707 determine . The PK/PD relationship plasma concentration GSK1360707 DAT SERT occupancy described.This protocol amendment include flexibility split total dose two dos e.g . 120mg per day could split two dos 60mg . Splitting total dose likely required maintain therapeutic occupancy transporter course day ; addition expect split dose may reduce effect vital sign . Therefore collect data follow split dose enable best prediction therapeutic dos progress subsequent clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Positron Emission Tomography Study Healthy Male Subjects Investigate Brain DAT SERT Occupancy , Pharmacokinetics Safety Single Oral Doses GSK1360707 , Using 11C- PE2I 11C-DASB PET Ligands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK1360707 show exhibit pharmacological action wide array vivo model dopaminergic activity show significantly increase level three neurotransmitter frontal cortex nucleus accumbens rat . GSK1360707 demonstrate antidepressant-like effect force swim test oral administration mouse rat . Inhibition three monoamine , alone combination , implicate mechanism action currently market antidepressant ( e.g. , paroxetine [ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ] , venlafaxine [ serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ] , bupropion [ selective dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ] ) . The known effectiveness compound enhance dopaminergic , serotonergic , and/or norepinephrine activity treatment depression , combine pre-clinical data GSK1360707 , suggest GSK1360707 may effective treatment Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . GSK1360707 recently complete FTIH single dose , dose escalation study healthy young subject ( study SNV111914 ) . The high single dose study 150 mg . Single dose include 150 mg generally well-tolerated . In FTIH study , apparent dose-dependent increase diastolic systolic blood pressure observe dose range 60 - 150 mg . The maximum increase blood pressure occur approximately Tmax generally continue less 6 h Tmax . Preliminary data indicate , systolic blood pressure , maximum mean value postdose 135 mmHg ( 150mg , 6 h post-dose ) , maximum individual value 164 mmHg ( 60mg , 3 h post-dose ) . For diastolic blood pressure maximum mean value post-dose 79 mmHg ( 150mg ) maximum individual value 113 mmHg ( 30mg dose ) . The level blood pressure attain post-dose GSK1360707 similar level occur middle-aged men woman healthy stable cardiovascular condition sexual activity exercise treadmill [ Palmeri , 2007 ] . This study constitute second clinical investigation compound , PET investigation total dose GSK1360707 healthy male subject ; study also include assessment pharmacokinetic parameter GSK1360707 well assessment safety tolerability . For serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( class ) therapeutic effect achieve chronic treatment generally SERT occupancy ≥ 80 % [ Meyer , 2004 ] , therapeutic effect mediate DAT inhibition generally achieve occupancy region 30 % [ Volkow , 2005 ] , abuse liability usually avoid DAT inhibition &lt; 50 % appropriately slow brain kinetic [ Volkow , 2005 ] . As vitro affinity data always consistent vivo data , information derive vivo assessment target occupancy potential greatly enhance process dose selection phase IIa , prediction abuse liability . With mind PET study conduct Papio Anubis use [ 11C ] DASB ( SERT ligand ) [ 11C ] PE2I ( DAT ligand ) determine relative vivo affinity GSK1360707 SERT DAT , time course occupancy GSK1360707 SERT DAT . In Papio Anubis GSK1360707 block [ 11C ] DASB [ 11C ] PE2I signal indicate brain penetrancy target bind vivo . The vivo affinities GSK1360707 DAT SERT find equivalent ( EC50 ~ = 20 ng/ml @ 15 min post dose ; EC50 ~ = 10 ng/ml @ 2-2.5 hr post dose ) , time course GSK1360707 washout infer occupancy data ( t1/2 effective free concentration = 3 hr ) . The lack suitable PET radioligand mean degree NAT [ NET ] occupancy exhibit GSK1360707 assess study . This human study use adaptive design assess time course plasma exposure-DAT SERT occupancy relationship human . The data use aid dose selection future study . The prediction effective exposure man base transporter occupancy [ also refer place RO receptor occupancy ] ( RO ) due poor predictive power animal disease model ( forced swim test rat ) .Predictions human therapeutic dose GSK1360707 base dissociation constant ( pKi ) human SERT DAT transporter , transporter occupancy GSK1360707 observe preclinical PET study , experience lead TRUI , GSK372475 . Exposure GSK1360707 linear dose compound show Tmax approximately 2 hour , Cmax approximately 50ng/mL high tolerate dose 150mg ; short terminal half-life calculate ( range 5-6 hour ) plasma concentration 24 hour close low limit detection ( 1ng/mL ) quantifiable dos test .</detailed_description>
