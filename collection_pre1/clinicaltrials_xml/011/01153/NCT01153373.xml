	<brief_summary>The investigator study use randomize control design . Eligible consent participant randomly assign one two condition : ( 1 ) DARSSA Intervention condition , ( 2 ) Minimal Intervention Control condition . All enrol participant undergo DARSSA baseline assessment interview immediately follow ED discharge ass relevant outcome , whether ask substance use give referral visit . This refer post-visit interview . All risky substance user enrol phase interview 1- 3-months post-visit ass substance use , treatment engagement , outcomes . The primary difference two condition , DARSSA Intervention condition , subject report print give option receive dynamic referral , Minimal Intervention Control condition subject undergo assessment receive standard substance abuse treatment referral list currently use clinically site .

	<detailed_description>Screening process . All patient verbally consent screen RA undergo computer assist screen substance abuse ( Rapid Screener ) administer research assistant . Patients use tobacco , misuse alcohol , use illicit drug screen eligibility participate randomize trial . Eligible patient invited participate sign consent form . Participants assign one two condition computer use random number generator . Results obtain part Rapid Screener research purpose . They report healthcare provider , unless participant enrol study assign DARSSA Intervention condition ( see ) . Minimal Intervention Control . All patient give consent participate study ( `` participant '' ) randomly assign control condition complete computerize DARSSA assessment purpose . The report print dynamic referral generate , patient receive treatment-as-usual ED provider . This preserve treatment-as-usual nature baseline maintain consistency administration DARSSA phase study . Although ED clinician know study conduct ED , inform result research assessment , give instruction training beforehand change standard screening , counseling , referral practice . This mean substance use screen likely inconsistent counseling referral provider rare . To maintain ethical standard , RAs provide substance abuse treatment resource list ( passive referral list ) subject screen positive , even though often happen routine clinical practice . Additionally , suicidal ideation directly assess part study , possible participant spontaneously report suicidal ideation . If happens , RA notify treat physician . Both effort could conceivably introduce intervention patient may otherwise receive , viable alternative investigator ensure patient safety . DARSSA Intervention . All participant randomize DARSSA Intervention give instruction complete assessment . Since DARSSA self-administered , like Polaris product , require computer literacy , instruction simple require clinician administer . Once complete , treat emergency physician expect ( 1 ) give substance use patient Patient Feedback Report , ( 2 ) recommend review carefully , ( 3 ) encourage consider follow referral . Any additional assessment counsel optional leave individual provider practice . We consider create standardized counseling protocol decide . We want maintain ecologically valid evaluation . In `` real world , '' provider would give extensive health behavior counsel training ask follow standardized counseling protocol implement DARSSA . Training provider health behavior counsel would act additional intervention right , could potentially mask ability determine effect DARSSA alone .</detailed_description>
