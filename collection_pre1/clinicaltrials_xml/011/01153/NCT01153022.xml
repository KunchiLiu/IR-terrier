	<brief_summary>Objective : To determine effect ankle joint mobilization alpha motoneuron reflex excitability soleus muscle people spasticity . Subjects Methods : A controlled clinical trial crossover design simple masking conduct 24 randomized subject initiate control experimental group . Traction rhythmic oscillation apply five minute ankle joint . Alpha motoneuron reflex excitability assess measure H wave amplitude ( Hoffmann reflex - H reflex ) , stimulate tibial nerve level popliteal fossa record soleus muscle . In subject 12 measurement take : basal rate , mobilization . Changes alpha motoneuron reflex excitability calculate relation basal measurement . For measurement hypothesis test perform ( Student test ) . Results : In group patient brain injury ( BI ) incomplete spinal cord injury ( ISCI ) , significant difference find measurement study , concern variation alpha motoneuron reflex excitability application joint mobilization technique , decrease experimental group increase control group . In contrast , significant difference find mobilization therapy . Patients complete spinal cord injury ( CSCI ) show significant difference measurement . Conclusion : We demonstrate effectiveness passive movement decrease muscle tone mobilization maneuver patient BI ISCI , residual effect completion trial . This research project show evidence regard spasticity reduction complete spinal cord injury . This suggest therapeutic intervention decrease muscle tone , base passive exercise stimulation proprioceptor reconsider .</brief_summary>
