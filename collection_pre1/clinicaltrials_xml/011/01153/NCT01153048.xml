	<brief_title>Trial Educative Structured Intervention Peer Educators Improve HbA1c Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Sikasso Region Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , estimate number people affect diabetes rise 171 million 2000 366 million 2030 , represent prevalence 2.8 % 4.4 % suppose obesity progress . Developing country represent 76 % world diabetic patient . This growth justify alarm report issue WHO 2005 rapid mobilization new health need . Access care , treatment , education care complication relate diabetes key feature resolution pass United Nations December 2006 diabetes protect people diabetes exclusion situation increase vulnerability . In develop country , explosion diabetes epidemic chronic disease , direct consequence widespread emergence overweight obesity . For develop country , major increase obesity , involve upper class popular class , essentially link emergence nutritional transition define gradual change diet , include clear increase fat animal origin consumption . Finally , increase obesity southern country , thus emergence chronic disease like diabetes , strengthen increase life expectancy growth physical inactivity.Education diabetes know several name : education patient , patient 's therapeutic education . All term question diabetic person 's place continuous progress involve permanent communication care team coordination care programme . The therapeutic education become model care people diabetes . Indeed , diabetes complex condition , require effective medical management caregiver good autonomous management person diabetes . This dual approach help promote choice healthy lifestyle , improve quality life reduce direct indirect health cost society . Educational approach set must recognize critical fundamental role psychosocial factor effective diabetes education . In 1914 , Elliott Joslin publish book stress importance training nurse participate education diabetes management [ 10 ] . In 1936 , insulin appear specialized nursing diabetes expand . It become clear nurse develop skill come education counsel well expertise clinical care . The publication DCCT study result 1993 UKPDS 1998 amend diabetes care , simple reduction glycaemia blood pressure , active prevention complication intensification treatment . It turn point role diabetes educator . In developed country , diabetes educator begin consider key aspect insulin dos adaptation , change eat habit screen complication , pave way work specialise nurse caregiver , dietician , chiropodist diabetes education . Several study highlight , developed country , challenge health professional implement education activity patient . Above consideration different cultural context , barrier often describe professional establishment effective patient education availability time inadequacy initial continue training . At hospital , particular context education situation take place necessarily encourage effective set prevention health practice every day life . In context African health system combine low human financial resource important turn staff , difficult establish specific curriculum diabetes educator , also mobilize health staff specifically task . In particular setting , involvement peer assistance daily management living diabetes , Social emotional support Linkage clinical care seem perfect tighten complement organization diabetes care country . The reviews several study show positive result approach implement follow several methodological model . For study choose implement evaluate impact methodology : The Learning Nests approach : Group Education focus understand key concept interaction social context . This approach develop health professional human science seem best suit socio economic cultural context encounter Africa . It base 5 principles- building set learn situation base scientific data medical social/human science frame ( socioconstructivism , didactic , learn adults- ) : - The integration context life develop educational situation - The work operational dimension ( use knowledge action , decision making learner ) , support individual booklet ( teacher learner ) - The intimate coupling educator train educational situation learner - The implementation long-term programme , precise indicator result METHODS Intended Audience Setting Direct beneficiary Mali The 150 diabetic patient directly reach activity The 7 peer educator train action area select Mali The 30 health agent action area select Mali Families relatives patient reach animation 2 country ( 40000 person ) Indirect beneficiary Mali All diabetic patient Mali ( 3 % adult population ) All health worker involve care diabetes NCD Mali The Malian health system improve monitoring diabetic patient reduce complication relate diabetes The Malian population reduce risk factor diabetes NCD increase quality life Indirect beneficiary Africa Diabetic patient French English speaking African country benefit methodology tool develop Health worker involve care diabetes French English speaking African country The health system population country General care diabetes available Intended Audience Between 2000 2003 , many study conduct identify problem prevention management diabetes Africa . These study show similar result : Health system : presence insulin , syringe test equipment vital , enough . It must accompany health system train personnel structure place . Health system Sub-Saharan Africa organize treatment acute non chronic illness . In African country , management diabetes available 2 public structure capital . In structure , number consultation high possibility perform patient education . This situation oblige many patient 500 1000 Km diabetes consultation . Diagnostic : problem level supply urine strip , strip Glucometers , tubes analyse reagent . However problem supply expensive . Education : All study show great difficulty implementation patient education . Indeed , lack decentralize consultation make number consultation within 3rd reference structure important education . The limited human financial resource also make education difficult . In parallel problem health system , eat habit must take account , establishment adequate education . Since 2003 , Mali Tanzania set advanced program improve prevention diabetes care 5 part : research activity / Decentralization diabetes care / Access medicine , analysis medical equipment / support creation set patient association / primary prevention Training : After set specific module specialize doctor Mali , 12 diabetes referral doctor train 3 region Mali 7 commune capital Bamako . Analysis , medical equipment medicine : structure , referral doctor work , equip glucometers urinary strip decline 25 percent price consumables . A several month work Central Pharmacy Mali ( PPM ) achieve national supply sharp drop price insulin ( actrapide insulatard ) , 2 type diabetes pill ( glibenclamide metformin ) , measure strip ketone protein urine , well syringe injection insulin . These new product lead sharp drop cost patient ( 50 percent discount insulin division price 10 diabetes pill ) . The consultation also equip prevention management diabetes ( measure apparatus , scale , tensiometer , tune fork , monofilament , tape measure , register etcâ€¦ ) Association : establishment operational consultation make possible , month month , decentralized consultation take care great number patient . These patient gradually group association around consultation . Primary prevention : wide action , use medium community action , implement inform educate people intervention area bring change behaviour term diet , physical activity , also accompany patient community . Education : To accompany care patient , first action develop start education health facility . For project consider necessary implement project area patient access equip quality consultation availability test equipment medication strong association . Recruitment approach reach intend audience A PosT test Club ( PTC ) social support club provide go prevention counseling , education support service people diabetes . PTC represent important link patient , educator general medical social economic service . PTC define club , facilitate well-trained peer educator , 3 objective : - To provide social emotional support diabetic patient - To help people feel isolated alone problem - To provide way meet people make friend - To help individual become confident powerful - To provide forum organize activity - To make links people different background - To share resource , idea information - To create public voice lead change To provide assistance daily management living diabetes - allow patient appropriate knowledge essential good manage chronic disease . - allow understand diabetes reduce cardiovascular risk learn manage treatment , diet regular physical expenditure . - Patients stake analyse element environment , representation ordinary habit knowledge come medical field . This analysis elements presence allow everyone take relevant appropriate decision ( family , culture , economic , social network ) . To provide linkage clinical care - Create network patient club structure manage diabetes action zone - Define patient circuit area patient club accompany best patient structure care The intervention area project select club establish area : - The consultation diabetic patient functional - Health structure drug care - Patient association around consultation dynamic - A partnership agreement sign health authority , patient ' association club area The club lead educator specifically train diabetic patient . They recruit diabetic patient association area club locate . The club make diabetic patient recruit diabetes consultation health facility diabetic patient association area . Approaches implement peer support program address three core component peer support : The purpose methodology set coordinate train education activity target population diabetes base pragmatic approach appropriation construction knowledge take account individual , social , economic , cultural context . This work implemented basis group modules specifically design running : studied concrete element knowledge mobilize , patient ' action , role health professional educator , indicator progress monitor session long term . Each patient get consider element involve his/her disease , action achieve take account feasibility his/her context . The education monitoring envisage data compendium present individual book give patient end education session . The education session build reference socioconstructivist model learn . Theoretically locate , situation develop reference research work come different field : include medical dimension ( epidemiology , nutrition , endocrinology ) cognitive social dimension chronic disease ( learn psychology , sociology health , Social medical anthropology ) . These education session allow work effective , assessable durable way knowledge come medical science ( understand cardiovascular risk diabetes , food management , management physical activity identification complication ) . Patients gotten realize individual potential social context evolve . All constituent element situation ( knowledge , representation patient , construction learn situation ) subject detail analysis aim objective possible . By stand prescriptive scheme structure many education practice , session doubly meet current need therapeutic education : allow patient access knowledge , also participate establishment new dynamic training health professional . This approach therefore proposing synthesis form , action knowledge various scientific field . The proposition understanding evaluation education action impact go beyond usual practice , invest scope ordinary habit patient ( still insufficiently explore ) . The animation session allow : - Patients appropriate knowledge essential good manage chronic disease . - Patients understand diabetes reduce cardiovascular risk learn manage treatment , diet regular physical expenditure . - Patients stake analyse element environment , representation ordinary habit knowledge come medical field . This analysis elements presence allow everyone take relevant appropriate decision ( family , culture , economic , social network ) . In practice implementation methodology take place 4 stage : 1 . - The training peer educator identify recruited lead animation 2 . - An initial cycle theme knowledge control cardiovascular risk ( BP , cholesterol , blood sugar , waist measurement , diabetes , treatment complication ) . Patients work modifiable element influence health vascular viewpoint , identify action may positive effect element , take account fact real life choose realistic action do 3- An initial cycle subject food controlling ( balance , fat , carbohydrate ) . Fat intake : analyse compare food contain diverse amount fat , identify unsaturated saturate fat content , evaluate correct amount fat diet necessary ; understand relation fat , visceral adiposity , glycaemia regulation 4- An initial cycle theme physical activity . Exercise : quantify his/her actual physical activity weekly basis , compare recommendation , analyse condition feasibility implement real life . In frame 3 Education session , patient require : - Analyse knowledge appear various form , include form tailor illiterate uneducated patient ( colour code , presence photograph ) - Act knowledge : patient observes , make hypothesis , test , compare , infer , analyse make connection . - Interact learner , give education social dimension . During education session , interactive workshop allow work : balance diet , carbohydrates diet , cardiovascular risk understand diabetes . For situation , one-day training conduct trained peer educator theoretical input issue dealt , put practice situation , analyse issue outside framework put `` safety education '' . These training day implement 8-10 patient ( 1H 30 ) 3 meeting take place period 2 3 month . The educational booklet available patient end meeting . The implementation comprehensive methodology , include selection action area , recruitment educator well patient implementation education learning nest , allow support : 1 . - Assistance daily management living diabetes : provision patient support understandable discussed situation facilitate appropriation knowledge time : write material discover , approach negotiated situation , help educator . The patient take write material home , keep carefully possibility organize monitor daily management diabetes life long term . 2 . - Social emotional support : methodology patient educator recruitment patient ' association educational club provide strong social emotional support patient . The group education methodology also allow patient support . Indeed , work interaction student , give education dimension allow strong emotional support . The possibility keep write material negotiate worked situation ( booklet ) , disseminate information within family or/and social network trained patient ( without risk knowledge transformation , booklet reference ) . This possibility increase number people informed prevention chronic disease , prevention complication also allow bring necessary information family social network form patient strengthen social emotional support bring patient . 3 . - Linkage clinical care : The choice intervention area Mali Tanzania do take account area care patient complete : effective operational diabetes consultation , medicine available dynamic diabetic patient association . In area , approach integrate . The addition education methodology educator represent another step care pyramid diabetes . All health worker area involve implement monitoring process . In addition role educator , educator also train accompany patient health facility manage diabetes intervention area . All peer educator receive tool represent circuit patient intervention area give patient animation . Finally , meeting patient may accompany health system . Approaches evaluation Experimental Design . would like propose specific evaluation design endpoint measure study site . We propose classical randomized control experimental ( RCT ) design , randomization person-level follow recruitment , informed consent , collection baseline data . Given potential value peer support 240 million person worldwide diabetes , large majority NOT live industrialize country [ 30 ] , would tragic waste opportunity evaluate peer support Africa use design immediately convince concern , include donor agency nation ask fund much future roll-out peer support may quite suspicious `` evidence '' would-be aid recipient . Widespread recognition result donor African leader clinician , come publication global journal like Lancet BMJ PLOS Medicine , also require strong possible experimental design . The RCT design provide great possible internal validity see reasonable alternative setting . A person-level randomized design also surprisingly feasible Mali . In location already achieve well-functioning clinical system diabetes care achieve guideline-adherent care ( base African regional diabetes guideline IDF guideline poor develop country ) . Therefore , next step , introduction peer support program , accomplish without induce significant cross-contamination ; , creation peer support group cause major change health care delivery process spill control-group subject . Moreover , face-time physician physician-extenders limit impoverished setting like , foresee much scope physician ( blind experimental assignment ) change treatment control compensatory way . However , prevent train relevant caregiver importance maintain experimental separation , track diabetes-related treatment detect bias might emerge . Outcome Measures . We propose change HbA1c primary study measure ( ) `` hard '' measure subject short-term variability social-desirability bias influence self-reported data ; ( b ) respond directly full breadth behavior peer-support intend modify , diet exercise self-glucose monitoring proper use medication ; ( c ) physiologic parameter urgent person diabetes improve . In addition HbA1c , also propose measure change systolic diastolic blood pressure , weight . Method randomization Patients select list diabetic patient follow two consultation diabetes Sikasso . From numbered list lottery conduct random number table constitute intervention group . From numbered list lottery conduct random number table constitute control group . We verify patient randomly select form group meet criterion inclusion group ( see ) . The randomization list keep principal investigator survey . Calculation size study In trial , patient randomize 2 group : - Group 1 : Intervention educational peer group associate traditional education - Group 2 : classic education without intervention peer education It assume reference group , value HbA1c 8.5 % correct standard deviation 1.5 , correct ( previous study conduct framework NGO Health Diabetes Mali underway publish ) consider strategy would interest assessed value mean HbA1c decrease 1 percentage point HbA1c standard deviation 0.5 .. In situation , risk Î± 5 % power 1-Î² 80 % , must include 60 patient group . To reflect proportion patient lose follow 20 % , decide recruit 75 patient per group 150 patient total Eligibility criteria The study conduct among patient type 2 diabetes follow decentralized unit city Sikasso ( third administrative region Mali ) . The methodology choice patient describe paragraph . The recruitment held month June-July 2010 . Inclusion Criteria - Patients treat unit diabetes intervention area perform regularly consultation - Patients type 2 diabetic insulin-treated untreated - Poorly control diabetes HbA1c â‰¥ 8 % - Patients agree undergo whole process peer education - Patients agree carry biological measure include Protocol - Patients age 30-80 year Criteria non-inclusion - Diabetic patient perform monitor unit area diabetes intervention - Patients diabetes follow unit intervention area perform regular consultation - Patients type 1 diabetes - Scalable severe complication within 3 month precede infection , complication heart disease , severe renal - Associated disease threaten vital functional - Refusal participate study Data management analysis Data Management . We propose require study data enter verified ( re-entered ) study sit via internet , currently multi-country study impact diabetes , use SQL interface mesh EPI-Info . By provide unique field number response-item , comparability maintain despite translation text substantive variation might require site site . Web-based data entry accomplish even town Africa data even program-wide web-based data entry system develop . . We propose store hard copy study form lock cabinet control PIs Bamako , Mali .</detailed_description>
