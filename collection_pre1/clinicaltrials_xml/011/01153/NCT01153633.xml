	<detailed_description>SUMMARY Sponsor : B. BRAUN Medical AG Trade name : Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution Prontosan® Wound Gel Active substance : Polihexanide ( 0.1 % ) Betaine ( 0.1 % ) Study Duration ( per patient ) : 13 week , include 1 week run period Primary Objective : To evaluate efficacy combination Prontosan® Wound Irrigation Solution Prontosan® Wound Gel reduction wind size hard-to-heal venous leg ulcer compare control saline irrigation solution inactive gel . Secondary Objectives : To assess change bio-burden ( assessment organism present ) determine local tolerance well reduction pain monitor exudate control . Methodology : A pilot randomise , double-blind , control clinical trial single centre Planned number patient : A sample size N= 15 evaluable patient estimate treatment group ( group `` A '' `` B '' ) . Adding dropout rate approx . 25 % result total number patient treatment group N=38 . Study Visits : Visit 0 ( -1 week ) - Screening Visit 1 ( Week 0 ) - Treatment assessment visit Visit 2 ( Week 1 , day 7 +/- 1 day ) - Treatment assessment visit Visit 3 ( Week 2 , day14 +/- 1 day ) - Treatment assessment visit Visit 4 ( Week 4 , day 28 +/- 2 day ) - Treatment assessment visit Visit 5 ( Week 8 , day 56 +/- 2 day ) - Treatment assessment visit Visit 6 ( Week 12 , day 84 +/- 2 day ) - End study follow 12 week treatment heal whichever soonest The number additional visit record Case Report Forms . Treatment efficacy assessment : Clinical sign symptom compare two randomised group microbiological analysis , computer planimetry assessment ulcer size , use Visitrak™ ( Smith &amp; Nephew ) , digital photography entry study , plan study visit heal 12 week , whichever soonest . Tolerance assessment : The tolerability study treatment evaluation base intensity course adverse event ( undesired concomitant effect , subjectively perceive symptom objectively detect sign disease ) . Tolerance assessment take place visit 2 onwards Assessment method : 1 . Assessment clinical sign symptom , particular relate development infection : - reduction slough necrotic tissue - control exudate - presence granulation tissue - reduction inflammatory sign ( surround skin ) - pain 2 . Ulcer computerise planimetry use Visitrak™ 3 . Microbiological analysis bioburden ( bioburden within ulcer relates microbiological qualitative quantitative assessment organism present ) assess wound swab biopsy 4 . Serial photography blind assessment progress use linear analogue scale</detailed_description>
