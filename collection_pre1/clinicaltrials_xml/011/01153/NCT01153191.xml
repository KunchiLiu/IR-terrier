	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate two different simple inexpensive extra treatment colorectal surgery see reduce rate post operative infection</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Interventions Minimize Surgical Site Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The population inclusion study drawn patient undergo elective transabdominal colorectal surgery . This population choose due inherently high rate superficial-incisional infection.Colorectal procedure stand particularly highrisk surgery respect SSI . Several study report rate infection 25 % make colorectal surgery excellent opportunity test new strategy reduce SSI . This pilot project seek preliminarily evaluate two new strategy inexpensive could readily incorporate current practice . The strategy pressurize irrigation superficial surgical wound ( fascia ) subcutaneous injection gentamicin surgical wound prior initial skin incision . Comparison make prospectively enrolled patient historic controls.The hypothesis test intervention significantly reduce superficial incisional infection rate compare historic control .</detailed_description>
