	<brief_summary>The purpose study see hormone control blood sugar change response two different weight loss surgery ( gastric bypass gastric banding ) . We believe change hormone call glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) may account great improvement blood sugar certain type surgery . GLP-1 make pancreas release insulin , hormone lower blood sugar . The study consist one screen visit three study visit glucose response measure drinking liquid meal : 1 ) Visit 1 ( 2-3 week surgery ) ; 2 ) Visit 2 ( 10 % body weight lose ) ; 3 ) Visit 3 ( 5-10 day Visit 2 ) . Hormone level measure three study visit . To see improvement blood sugar surgery due change GLP-1 , block effect insulin release give either salt water medication block activity GLP-1 two visit take place surgery ( Visits 2 3 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many diabetic patient Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) rapid improvement blood sugar within day surgery , even lose much weight . It typically take much long improvement occur adjustable gastric banding ( AGB ) , despite equally low caloric intake . Changes level hormone release small intestine consequence particular type surgery may important factor rapid improvement blood sugar . One hormone , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , important effect insulin secretion pancreas . This study seek determine whether change GLP-1 responsible improvement blood sugar certain type weight loss surgery . In order meet inclusion criterion , participant must type 2 diabetes less 10 year approve insurance undergo RYGB AGB Hospital University Pennsylvania Penn Presbyterian Medical Center . We obtain several measurement GLP-1 hormone affect glucose level three study visit : 1 ) Visit 1 ( 2-3 week surgery ) ; 2 ) Visit 2 ( 10 % body weight lose ) ; 3 ) Visit 3 ( 5-10 day Visit 2 ) . To see improvement blood sugar surgery due change GLP-1 , block effect insulin release give either salt water medication block activity GLP-1 two visit take place surgery ( Visits 2 3 ) . Each visit last 4-6 hour participant compensate time .</detailed_description>
