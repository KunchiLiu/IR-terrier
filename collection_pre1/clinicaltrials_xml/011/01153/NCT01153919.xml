	<brief_title>Romiplostim Treating Hepatitis C-Infected Patients With Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess platelet count response administration weekly romiplostim patient HCV infection whose initial platelet count &lt; 70,000/L . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability romiplostim treatment patient HCV infection thrombocytopenia ; include physical symptom finding , hematologic , serum chemistry liver function test adverse event . II . To assess ability romiplostim enable subject achieve platelet count sufficient start antiviral therapy . III . To assess ability romiplostim maintain platelet count great 50,000/L receive antiviral therapy pegylated interferon ribavirin . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive romiplostim subcutaneously weekly 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Arm II : Patients receive placebo subcutaneously weekly 8 week . Patients fail achieve platelet count &gt; 100,000/L cross arm I . Patients achieve platelet count &gt; 100,000/L 8 week receive PEG-interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously weekly oral ribavirin daily . Treatment repeat every 7 day 24-48 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 36 week .</detailed_description>
