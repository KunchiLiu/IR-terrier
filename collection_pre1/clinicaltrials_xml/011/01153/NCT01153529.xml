	<brief_summary>The long-term goal research project identify gene contribute guard develop posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) good understand gene life experience work together impact PTSD . Inherited trait pass one generation next gene . Genes contain molecule call DNA , contain information determine characteristic carry instruction construct operating body . Most human disease inherit element . In addition , , investigator , hope learn gene material find participant ' blood relate illnesses behavior . The goal feasibility project cover application test possibility conduct research large number veteran order look association gene PTSD . We invite 1,000 OEF/OIF veteran participate , , anticipate approximately 250 veteran serve Afghanistan and/or Iraq participate study . Although 250 participant target enrollment , plan enroll veteran include initial mailing desire participate . We anticipate exceed 500 individual . This phase study expect last one year . Specific aim : 1. evaluation sample method participation rate ; 2. field test assessment battery include reliability validity ; 3. evaluation propose DNA collection storage procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : The primary purpose feasibility project evaluate feasibility collect case-control cohort OEF/OIF veterans large enough make possible identification genetic variant affect risk PTSD exposure traumatic event . We also determine DNA sample sufficient quality subsequent analysis . The primary purpose main project cover application identify gene affect risk develop PTSD . - RESEARCH QUESTIONS : - A.What participation rate propose recruitment strategy ? - B.How well propose assessment battery work component need modify ? - C.How well propose sample method work ? - D.Will propose study procedure need change make work well ? - STUDY AIM : The specific aim developed feasibility phase main study goal identify important gene influence risk resilience PTSD understand gene interact environmental stressor cause ( protect ) clinical disorder . The feasibility phase protocol present design : - 1.Evaluate sample method participation rate propose population determine recruitment feasibility main study , - 2.Develop field experience propose assessment battery measure reliability validity adjust necessary main study , - 3.Pilot feasibility DNA collection , storage analysis . After feasibility phase complete , protocol main study plan submit scientific peer review . - METHODS : The OEF/OIF Roster generate Defense Manpower Data Center use obtain list veteran serve least one two theater operation since begin conflict Iraq and/or Afghanistan . Access roster manage VA Environmental Epidemiology Service ( EES ) . This roster currently contain 1,001,463 veteran , 888,454 male 475,155 sought treatment within VA. Data point abstract roster include , limited , name , address , SSN , birth date , combat end date , end service date , separation date , military branch , deployment country . To achieve target enrollment 250 , 1,000 veteran roster randomly select potential participation . After sample 1,000 randomly draw , Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center ( CSPCC ) mail letter invite study participation . We expect initial 1,000 mailing yield follow result : - 300 letter non-deliverable another address search re-mail take place . Nevertheless , anticipate 200 letter remain undeliverable . - 800 letter deliverable 400 expected yield response 2 week . Second reminder letter send potential participant . - 500 respond within 2 week 250 willing participate ( include state willingness provide DNA sample ) 250 interested participation . If estimate yield minimum 250 participant , second wave mailing send new sample potential participant ( N determine base participation rate first N = 1000 mailing ) . Although 250 participant target enrollment , plan enroll veteran include initial mailing desire participate . We anticipate exceed 500 individual . Potential participant indicate interest study return response letter directly call dedicate toll-free telephone number . The VA website ( http : //www.csp.research.va.gov/ ) descriptive information study participant may view time well approve informed consent document . Participants opportunity ask question study contact study team CSPCC . The information plan include website follow : - DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN : While loss confidentiality guarantee could possible risk , step take minimize risk loss confidentiality . First , collect data receive Cooperative Studies Program Coordinating Center store lock file cabinet lock office study team member access . In addition , Study ID number use identify material participant response . Any identifying information maintain separately ( locked cabinet different office ) . With regard participant discomfort , participant remind begin interview refuse answer question discontinue participation time . If issue relate trauma memory arise , participant ask want contact study clinician would like provided medical/mental health resource . Participants also ask need break different interval interview participant experience fatigue due duration survey . If participant becomes upset , study clinician contact interviewer . If simply want talk clinician ( per exit interview criterion , well ) . If participant request assistance without upset distress , provide information connect local resource . The role psychologist collaborate study staff , work directly study clinician , interface central IRB first line resource decision need make first line resource coordinate center . The blood sample take certify home health nurse experience minimize manage venipuncture side effect . We propose minimize potential risk relate genetic sample never reveal genotype information participant . No genotype become part participant ' medical record . Participant sample cod code use identify participant computer database . The computer file password protect . Any hard copy maintain locked filing cabinet lock office , code book lock different office . Blood sample send Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research Information Center ( MAVERIC ) place secure storage . Although blood sample bank part CSPG001 - VA Genomic Medicine Program : Specimen Collection Banking Protocol , process use approve established procedure . - DATA ANALYSIS : Key Feasibility Outcomes Resultant Decision Processes - 1 . Participation Rate Evaluation : - ( ) If few 1 10 participant `` case '' ( i.e. , current PTSD ) , feasibility main study question , would require sample 100,000 screen interview achieve future target sample size N = 10,000 case . - ( b ) If few 1 4 potential participant agree participate follow provide DNA sample , feasibility question , would indicate need 4 time many contact order achieve sufficient screen interview yield final sample . A participation rate low 1 4 would also indicate sufficient non-representativeness sample finding could question basis unknowable sample bias . - 2.Assessment Batteries Evaluation Reliability : - ( ) Time complete paper-and-pencil interview measure record , measure may drop minimize participant burden . - ( b ) Psychometric property customize measure determine , unsuitable drop , improve , substitute . Specific critical measure evaluate : - . ) PTSD interview component : Comparison positive negative predictive value War Related Illness Injury Study Center Questionnaire ( Section IV telephone interview ) - ii . ) Short-Screening Scale DSM-IV Posttraumatic Stress Disorder screen . Optimum measure require PPV NPV &gt; 0.8 - iii . ) MINI interview lifetime current PTSD : Validity versus CAPS kappa &gt; 0.7 lifetime diagnosis - 3.If study 's response system participant psychological distress need phase , safety plan evaluate - 4.Determine type frequency report psychological distress telephone interview . Ensure suitable emergency response plan available participant describe psychological distress ( e.g. , suicidal ideation ) telephone interview .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1.Participant must serve support Operation Enduring Freedom Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) study relevant veteran 1 . Participants unconscious 30 minute . This may impact event recall 2 . Lifetime diagnosis and/or treatment bipolar disorder schizophrenia . ( NOTE : PTSD context severe psychiatric disorder likely different PTSD outside context . Excluding subject severe psychiatric disorder increase homogeneity sample power detect genetic effect . ) 3 . Refusal participate .</criteria>
