	<detailed_description>Postural stability balance define body 's ability return body back equilibrium point expose perturbation . This exploratory project base hypothesis decrease balance ( increased sway measure center pressure body quiet stand ) cause increase risk fall osteopathic manipulative treatment improve postural balance . To test idea , investigator investigate kinematics ( study way body move ) postural balance two cohort healthy elder , receive manipulation receive manipulation . We hypothesize OMT effective increase postural stability , balance . Specific Aims Aim 1 : To measure balance cohort healthy elder ( age 65 ) use force plate measure center pressure Anterior/posterior medial-lateral direction quiet stand eye open , eye close Romberg test . Aim 2 : To evaluate effectiveness OMT improve balance healthy elderly population . We observe progression improvement balance one group receive OMT four week compare receive OMT . Aim 3 : To examine potential impact efficacy OMT cardiac circulatory response measure blood flow circulation .</detailed_description>
