	<brief_summary>Specific Aims : ( Study # 1 , fund AHRQ , complete May 2011 ) 1 . To create automatic notification system prompt physician test result finalize discharge . 2 . To evaluate impact system physician awareness test result finalize discharge . Hypothesis : Automatic email notification improve physician awareness test result finalize discharge compare usual care . Specific Aims : ( Study # 2 , fund CRICO , complete July 2012 ) 1 . To identify cohort discharge patient potentially actionable result test pending discharge ( TPAD ) . 2 . To determine automate email notification finalize result potentially actionable TPADs affect rate post-discharge action take documented electronic medical record ( EMR ) .

	<brief_title>An Automatic Notification System Test Results Finalized After Discharge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Failure follow abnormal test result critical problem likely occur case test perform hospital whose result available finalized discharge ( i.e. , pending test result ) . Responsible inpatient ambulatory provider may aware test result . In prior study , Roy et al . determine 41 % patient discharge laboratory , microbiology , radiology test result finalize ( 31 % collectively hematology , chemistry , pathology test , 27 % radiology study , 42 % microbiology result ) . Of result , 9.4 % consider potentially actionable independent physician review could alter post-discharge patient care plan . Physicians aware 38 % test result . Failure follow-up test result lead delays diagnosis , miss treatment opportunity , redundant ordering test , subsequent patient harm . In hospital size Brigham Women 's Hospital ( BWH ) 44,000 annual admission , physician would unaware almost 2000 actionable test result per year . Automated system mitigate problem ensure prompt notification relevant test result finalize discharge responsible inpatient ambulatory provider . Using internal BWH funding , develop automate email notification system facilitate management test pending discharge ( TPADs ) . In study 1 ( funded AHRQ ) , prospectively evaluate impact intervention physician awareness TPAD result . In study 2 ( funded CRICO ) , perform chart review determine impact intervention downstream action take physician acknowledgment TPAD result document electronic medical record .</detailed_description>
