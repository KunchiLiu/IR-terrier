	<brief_summary>Much experimental data suggest thyroid hormone ( T3 T4 ) may modulate neoplastic cell T3/T4 deprivation may remove stimulus . It well establish T3/T4 affect cell division/angiogenesis binding integrin avb3 , commonly over-expressed many cancer cell . In experimental setting , mimic hypothyroidism cell difficult task . Currently , use charcoal strip serum use . Using method , serum strip T3 T4 , intend , also central important cytokine growth factor . This lead reduced rate cancer cell proliferation thus , reflect natural environment cancer cell residue hypothyroid condition . The investigator aim characterize establish effect serum hypothyroid patient proliferation/viability variety cancer cell model .</brief_summary>
