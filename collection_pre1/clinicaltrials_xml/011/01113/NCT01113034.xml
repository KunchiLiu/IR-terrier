	<brief_title>A Safety Trial DAS181 ( Fludase® ) Adult Subjects With Well-Controlled Asthma Bronchiectasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assess safety new study drug call DAS181 ( Fludase® ) . This study do NexBio , Inc. , company make DAS181 ( Fludase® ) . DAS181 approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) ; however FDA give permission use DAS181 human study . To date , DAS181 give 81 healthy people well tolerate report serious adverse reaction . This first experimental study test safe use drug people well-controlled asthma bronchiectasis . DAS181 give treat asthma bronchiectasis , learn safe use people well-controlled asthma bronchiectasis . DAS181 develop medication prevent treat infection due common respiratory virus like influenza ( include pandemic H1N1 strain ) , parainfluenza , virus . New drug treat respiratory virus need currently available drug effective type strain virus . Drugs effective respiratory virus especially important people asthma bronchiectasis lung condition increase risk serious complication due respiratory virus infection . Making sure new drug safe people asthma bronchiectasis important people lung condition may different side effect drug people n't asthma bronchiectasis . We plan enroll 24 volunteer study : 12 person well-controlled asthma 12 person bronchiectasis .</detailed_description>
