	<brief_summary>Sertraline , serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) increase basal serotonin level , show reduce alcohol consumption lower risk/severity later onset ( LOA ) high risk/severity earlier onset alcoholic individual ( EOA ) . By contrast , ondansetron , 5-HT3 receptor reduce alcohol consumption EOAs LOAs . To explain contrast clinical efficacy , one approach suggest differential serotonergic response base functional polymorphism 5-HTTLPR promoter region serotonin re-uptake transporter ( SERT ) . These allele typically classify biallelic genotype : LL , SS SL . The LL variant postulate associated EOA SS/SL variant associate LOA . To test hypothesis investigator therefore propose match mismatch serotonergic treatment genetic polymorphic variant [ 132 non-treatment seek alcohol dependent volunteer ] double-blind placebo control 2 x 2 design human laboratory study . The investigator propose randomize non-treatment-seeking alcohol dependent person base 5'-HTTLPR variant genotype ( LL SS/SL ) one two counterbalance arm : participant first arm ( LL ) first receive one drug ( either 200mg/day sertraline ondansetron 0.5mg/day ) three week follow alcohol self-administration experiment ( ASAE ) , [ 1 week down-titration period sertraline receive first , first week `` placebo period '' ] receive placebo two week ( single-blind portion use comparison group wash pharmacodynamic effect first drug ) follow second ASAE . Participants receive second drug three week follow third ASAE [ receive medication additional 1 week period receive sertraline last down-titrated ] . Participants second arm ( SS/SL ) receive medication balance design . Individuals arm receive weekly medication management enhance medication adherence . The long-term objective research prospectively examine serotonergic treatment match alcohol dependence base genotyping . Of equal importance , investigator also recognize strong contribution additional genetic environmental influence alcohol consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Medications genetics identify research priority NIAAA . The present application propose test two genetic-drug matching hypothesis well understand heterogeneity among alcoholic . Previous basic science , treatment genetic research suggest active drinker LL genetic variant serotonin transporter 5'-HTTLPR ( hypothesize genetic risk factor early onset alcoholism ) respond well ondansetron sertraline placebo . Conversely , active drinker SS SL genetic variant serotonin transporter 5'-HTTLPR ( hypothesize genetic risk factor late onset alcoholism ) respond well sertraline ondansetron placebo . The objective research match mismatch serotonergic treatment genetic polymorphic variant double-blind placebo control 2 x 2 design laboratory study 2 arm counterbalance . The specific aim investigate : ( 1 ) whether LL-carriers receive ondansetron result significant reduction alcohol consumption alcohol self-administration experiment ( ASAE ) period treatment ; ( 2 ) whether SL SS-carriers receive sertraline result significant reduction alcohol consumption ASAE period treatment ; ( 3 ) examine mechanism action crave subjective effect ASAE session : ( 4 ) whether reduction alcohol consumption ASAEs presence LG , LA 5-HTTLPR variant LL participant receive ondansetron LL participant receive sertraline ; ( 5 ) primary aim moderate presence C ( -1019 ) G polymorphism 5-HT1A gene promoter . We propose randomize 132 non-treatment-seeking alcohol dependent participant base 5'-HTTLPR variant genotype ( LL SS/SL ) one two counterbalance arm : e.g . subject first arm first receive one drug ( either 200mg/day sertraline ondansetron 0.5mg/day ) three week follow ASAE , receive placebo three week ( single-blind portion use comparison group wash pharmacodynamic effect first drug ) follow second ASAE . Finally , participant receive second drug three week follow third ASAE . Volunteers second arm receive medication counter-balanced fashion . There 1-week titration first third segment subject . The long-term objective propose research examine serotonergic treatment match alcohol dependence base genotyping , begin investigate patient variation match prospectively one serotonergic treatment .</detailed_description>
