	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess response rate AMG 102 Avastin treatment subject advance malignant glioma . Secondary objective estimate overall survival 6-month progression-free survival rate population ass safety combination population . Patients must recurrent histologically confirm diagnosis World Health Organization ( WHO ) grade IV malignant glioma ( glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma ) 3 prior progression . Subjects receive Avastin AMG 102 every two week . Avastin administer prior AMG 102 . Up 36 adult subject take part study Duke . In initial Phase I II clinical trial , four potential Avastin-associated safety issue identify : hypertension , proteinuria , thromboembolic event , hemorrhage . The common side effect AMG 102 nausea fatigue .</brief_summary>
