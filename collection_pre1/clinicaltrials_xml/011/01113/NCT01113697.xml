	<detailed_description>Asthmatic and/or allergic rhinitis ( 'hay fever ' ) individual respond differently , reproducibly , allergen challenge . Some individual develop isolate early response others also go develop late response . In asthmatic individual , airway narrow represent early phase asthmatic response airway challenge ; early phase onset detect within ten minute allergen inhalation , reach maximum within thirty minute , typically resolve within three hour . In 50-60 % allergic asthmatic adult , early response follow late phase asthmatic response , usually start three four hour allergen inhalation challenge , characterize cellular inflammation airway , increase lung tissue permeability , mucus secretion . Thus , approximately half allergic asthmatic subject 'dual responder ' ( develop early- late-phase response follow allergen inhalation challenge ) , 30-40 % allergic asthmatic adult develop 'isolated early response ' , &lt; 10 % adult show 'isolated late response ' . In give individual , pattern response generally consistent . In allergic rhinitis individual challenge environmental exposure pollen , equivalent difference exist proportion subject undergo isolate early dual phase nasal response , response measure clinical end-points common symptom allergic rhinitis ( 'hay fever ' ) . The role inherit genetic variation might play differential early late response far unexplored . However , recent experimental data mouse model provide strong evidence genetics could play important role . When specific intracellular pathway disrupt specific mouse gene-knockouts , lead inhibition late response allergen challenge , whilst maintain early response . The pathway know Bcl10/Malt1 pathway , normally respond allergen exposure activate expression gene code pro-inflammatory protein . The uncoupling late response early response suggest possibility genetic variation gene involve human Bcl10/Malt1 pathway may influence nature allergic response human . We investigate whether genetic basis individual develop isolate early-phase response allergen challenge whilst individual develop early- late-phase response ( dual response ) . We recruit human allergic subject undergo experimentally-controlled allergen challenge . The specific airway response individual carefully precisely measure , blood sample collect prior , two hour , allergen challenge . Due uniqueness cohort novel genetic study , logical initially undertake hypothesis-generating experiment . Such experiment involve determination differential change genome-wide gene expression white blood cell change protein lipid composition blood plasma , post-challenge compare pre-challenge . We formulate test hypothesis base result initial study , well specific follow hypothesis : inherit genetic variation within Bcl10/Malt1 pathway influence early- late-phase allergic response allergen challenge . Despite tremendous interest , difference pathways lead dual response lead isolate early response completely understood . Understanding difference important evaluate allergic disease asthma allergic rhinitis . In contrast transient isolate early response , development late response associate hallmark inflammatory feature chronic allergic disease . The combined cohort represent unique resource study fundamental physiologic response allergy , provide genetic insight new pathway pharmacologic target treatment chronic asthma allergic rhinitis .</detailed_description>
