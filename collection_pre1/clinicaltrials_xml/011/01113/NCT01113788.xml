	<brief_summary>The investigator propose third hypothesis base anatomic observation make pathological study . The investigator hypothesize anatomic architecture determine functional property TV-IVC isthmus . As result , â€¢ Muscular bundle preferential route conduction TV-IVC isthmus . The isthmus act like series discreet conduction rout rather sheet tissue . The muscular bundle form selective target ablation therefore entire anatomic line need ablate . This direct implication ablation isthmus .</brief_summary>
