	<detailed_description>In patient age 65 , cardiovascular disease account large percentage death , hospital day , doctor visit , overall health care expenditures . In addition , heart failure common discharge diagnosis elderly . Heart failure define state cardiac output insufficient meet metabolic demand . This frequently manifest symptom fatigue dyspnea . Inherent definition symptom may increase occur time metabolic demand increase , exercise . As , exercise intolerance hallmark heart failure syndrome . Exercise intolerance correlate disease severity also subsequent mortality . Exercise tolerance objectively quantify maximal symptom limit standardized exercise protocol analysis exercise time , workload , METS ( metabolic equivalent ) , oxygen consumption ( V02 ) ' These measure appropriately become accepted standard functional assessment disorder well outcome measure follow therapeutic intervention HF . P.A.R.I.S . randomize , attention-controlled , single-blind trial supervise aerobic exercise training old patient heart failure . The primary outcome exercise capacity main secondary outcome quality life . Mechanistic outcome also examine . In PARIS , focus cardiac mechanism , HFPEF HFREF patient study parallel . In PARIS-II , HFPEF patient focus vascular mechanism . Main outcomes report ( see citation ) .</detailed_description>
