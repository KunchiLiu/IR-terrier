	<brief_title>Oral Galactose Children With Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PLAN A : Primary aim : 1 . Determine effect 4 month oral galactose administration level FSPF child steroid resistant FSGS 2 . Determine effect 4 month oral galactose administration first morning urine protein creatinine ( urine protein : creatinine ) ratio serum albumin level child steroid resistant FSGS . B : Secondary aim : 1 . Determine effect 4 month oral galactose administration dose immunosuppressive medication . 2 . Assess first morning urine protein : creatinine ratio , serum albumin level , change immunosuppression dose 3 month discontinuation oral galactose therapy . B.Background Significance Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) child commonly due minimal change nephrotic syndrome successfully treat steroid therapy . However 10-15 % child nephrotic syndrome diagnose FSGS , resistant steroid therapy many immunosuppressive drug , associate poor outcome . Approximately 50 % patient FSGS progress ESRD within 5-10 year 30 % child , FSGS recur transplantation . ( 1 ) African-American child significantly high risk FSGS . ( 2 ) Recent study indicate primary FSGS heterogeneous disorder cause genetic mutation nearly third case yet undefined immunological defect remain case . ( 3 ) Immune mediate FSGS associate circulate permeability factor , thought increase glomerular permeability albumin , lead proteinuria contributes sclerotic lesion FSGS . Presence FSPF define permeability activity &gt; 0.5 . ( 4 ) Current therapy FSGS include plasmapheresis many immunosuppressive agent include cyclosporine , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , rituximab , drug decrease proteinuria angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) inconsistent outcome . Additionally , drug long-term consequence immunosuppression drug cyclosporine tacrolimus affect renal function adversely use prolong period time . ( 5 ) There urgent need investigate benign therapy galactose . If proven useful , may present safe alternative adjunct currently available therapy . Preliminary Studies : 1 . In 2008 , Savin et al . show galactose , simple nontoxic sugar , bind high affinity FSPF vitro . ( 6 ) They also find trace amount galactose ( &gt; 10-12 M ) inhibit glomerular permeability activity induce FSPF vitro . This series vitro experiment also demonstrate effect FSPF activity serum reverse incubation galactose alternatively pre-incubation glomerulus galactose . Additionally , author describe significantly decrease permeability activity vivo single patient post-transplant FSGS response IV oral galactose . The FSPF activity patient decrease progressively 4 week galactose ingestion ( 0.8 0.1 ) , persist 4 week discontinuation oral galactose ( 0.2 ) . The propose mechanism action FSPF galactose-binding site interact galactose glomerular glycocalyx , activate signal transduction podocytes . Introduction free galactose may block FSPF bind site alter tertiary structure FSPF , thus inhibit activity . Despite decrease FSPF activity patient , proteinuria improve . The author propose lack clinical response may due advanced stage kidney damage time IV galactose therapy , patient already dialysis time oral galactose administration . It would important study introduction galactose early course FSGS determine effective decrease proteinuria delay progression FSGS . De Smet et al present experience case 48-year old male , nephrotic syndrome secondary FSGS , treat oral galactose 10 gm BID 6 month , annual meeting American Society Nephrology 2008 ( ASN 08 , TH-PO-955 ) . Their patient fail respond prednisone , cyclophosphamide , mycophenolate mofetil , cyclosporine plasma exchange . Prior treatment , FSPF detect 0.87 urinary protein excretion 4.3 gm/day . After treatment galactose , FSPF decrease 0.09 urinary protein excretion decrease 0.56 gm/day . The success obtain case argue trial additional patient . Methods : 1 . Oral galactose therapy : After obtain informed consent assent FSPF obtain baseline determine eligibility . Blood sample FSPF collect `` red-top '' tube ( without anti-coagulant ) , allow clot , spin separate . The serum ship ice FSPF analysis laboratory Virginia Savin , Medical College Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI . All parameter ( include weight , height , blood pressure , urinalysis , urine protein : creatinine ratio , serum albumin , creatinine , electrolytes , glucose ) collect visit part standard care . Female participant child bear age give urine pregnancy test exclude study pregnant . Once patient find eligible , oral galactose initiate dose 0.2gm/kg/dose BID maximum 15 gm BID period 4 month . The prescribed dose galactose powder dispense subject packet , mixed 4 ounce water , consume orally . FSPF measure week 16 . All parameter repeat 4 , 10 16 week start oral galactose . Oral galactose therapy stop 16 week . In order determine clinical significance galactose treatment , set clinical parameter ( weight , height , blood pressure , urinalysis , first morning urine protein : creatinine ratio , serum albumin , creatinine , electrolytes , glucose ) obtain 12 week discontinuation oral galactose . Measurement adherence galactose estimate count number galactose dos return subsequent monthly visit . Patients consider adherent take &gt; 90 % prescribed dos . 2 . Adjunct therapy nephrotic syndrome : Each patient remain baseline therapy immunosuppressive therapy cyclosporine , tacrolimus mycophenolate mofetil . Steroids dose tapered 0.5mg/kg , maximum 40 mg , every day time start galactose . If patient achieves remission , indicate negative first morning urine protein 3 consecutive day , alternate day steroid therapy taper 0.12mg/kg/dose 10 mg/dose , per week . If patient sustain remission 1 month , prednisone , dose immunosuppressive drug lower 25 % per month . BP control 95th percentile height . If patient ACE inhibitor ARBs , dose stay unchanged duration galactose administration unless patient experience side effect therapy . If additional therapy control hypertension need , would choose antihypertensive drug ACE inhibitor ARBs . Diuretics prescribe need symptomatic relief edema . Adjunct therapy medication describe section standard care research purpose . Result analysis : Each patient serve control . Results consider clinically significant follow criterion meet response oral galactose therapy week 16 reduction urine protein : creatinine increase serum albumin persist 12 week discontinuation galactose . 1 . Reduction FSPF &lt; 0.5 decrease FSPF &gt; 0.3 2 . Decrease first morning urine protein : creatinine ratio 50 % 3 . Increase serum albumin &gt; 1gm/dl 4 . Decrease dose prednisone immunosuppressive drug 25 % Statistical Analysis The primary outcome mean paired pre vs. post galactose treatment difference FSPF , urine protein : creatinine ratio , serum albumin dose immunosuppressive drug . We use repeated measure ANCOVA model estimate primary outcome dependent variable hold constant pre-treatment level . Therefore , independent variable pre-treatment level correspond dependent variable , The model use estimate mean difference +/- 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) correspond mean level dependent variable pre-treatment . We consider pre-post difference statistically significant 95 % CI around result fails include 0 clinically significant meet criteria specify . Adequacy Sample : We evaluate effect size difference could detect 80 % 90 % power pre-post treatment study galactose involve 10 patient assessed pre-treatment post-treatment . The correlation measurement person assume .7 two-tailed type 1 error set 0.05 . The study well 90 % power detect effect size difference 0.6 sd well 80 % power detect effect size difference 0.5 sd . These consider moderate effect size . Research Facilities : The FS permeability factor test laboratory Virginia Savin MD ( Center Glomerular Pathophysiology , Medical College Wisconsin , Milwaukee , WI ) use previously describe method . ( 7 ) Risks Side Effects : FSGS difficult treat disease associate poor outcome , include progression end stage renal disease . Galactose naturally occur simple sugar oral galactose supplementation know side risk side effect human . Patients eligible study fail respond current alternative treatment FSGS , include steroid immunosuppressive agent , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil , rituximab . These alternative immunosuppressive treatment many long term complication , include stunted growth , nephrotoxicity , hyperlipidemia , diabetes . There urgent need investigate benign therapy galactose , may present safe alternative adjunct current therapy . There known side effect oral galactose supplementation report toxicity chronic use human . The Certificate Origin D-Galactose product FerroPfanstiehl include Appendix certifies D-Galactose use study safe human consumption . D-Galactose administer safely diagnostic test glycogen storage disease cirrhotic liver disease ( 8 ) sonographic contrast agent , Levovist Â® ( Bayer ) . Galactose also successfully administer treatment Fabry 's disease . ( 9 ) In case report , IV galactose infusion administer dose 1 g/kg every day 2 year time liver function test remain normal . Possible association dairy intake ovarian cancer investigate inconclusive result . A 2006 pool analysis 12 cohort study do Harvard School public health find association intake dairy food ovarian cancer statistically insignificant increase risk ovarian cancer intake lactose &gt; 30 g/d . This study involve analyze survey report dairy intake , account presence factor milk , hormone , could contribute ovarian cancer risk ( 10 ) . Another 2005 meta-analysis European Journal Cancer Prevention find association milk/dairy product galactose metabolism ovarian cancer risk . ( 11 ) In addition occur naturally milk , galactose approve FDA substance Generally Recognized Safe ( GRAS ) ingredient infant formula baby food pediatric nutrition supplement form galacto-oligosaccharides ( compound make 1 7 galactose molecule link glucose molecule reduce end ) . ( www.fda.gov/food/foodingredientspackaging/generallyrecognizedassafeGRAS/GRASListings/ucm153910.htm ) Benefits : FSGS resistant steroid therapy many immunosuppressive drug , associate poor outcome . Approximately 50 % patient FSGS progress ESRD within 5-10 year 30 % child , FSGS recur transplantation . ( 1 ) Given devastate course disease benign nature propose galactose treatment , anticipate benefit far outweigh risk . If effective , galactose supplementation could stop progression FSGS , limit glomerular damage prevent progression disease ESRD . The potential benefit preserve kidney function prevent need dialysis transplantation significant participant study child FSGS may benefit galactose therapy future .</detailed_description>
