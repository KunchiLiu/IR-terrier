	<brief_title>TPI 287 Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : TPI 287 design block protein cause cancer cell resist effect chemotherapy . By block protein , drug may able cause cancer cell shrink stop growing . Bevacizumab give patient find brain damage , describe . It design block growth new blood vessel . It may help low amount brain damage related tumor tissue death help limit symptom condition . Study Drug Administration : On Day 1 21-day study `` cycle , '' receive TPI 287 vein 1 hour . If experience intolerable side effect , dose TPI 287 may lower . Your doctor tell lower dose due side effect . To help prevent allergic reaction TPI 287 , also receive follow drug : - Benadryl® ( diphenhydramine ) vein 30 minute , 30-60 minute receive TPI 287 - Cimetidine vein 30 minute , 30-60 minute receive TPI 287 - Either dexamethasone methylprednisolone ( take mouth 12 6 hour receive TPI 287 ; vein 30 minute 30-60 minute receive TPI 287 ) If MRI scan show evidence brain damage related tumor tissue death receive TPI 287 two infusion , eligible receive bevacizumab . On Day 1 Cycle 3 beyond , eligible , receive bevacizumab vein 60-90 minute . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may experience . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Your weight vital sign measure . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test On Day 15 every even-numbered cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , MRI scan check status disease . Length Study : You study 6 month . You may continue receive study drug long benefiting . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If eligible receive , may continue receive bevacizumab long benefit . You take bevacizumab disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 28 day stop receive study drug , end-of-treatment visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You ask drug may take experienced side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You MRI scan check status disease one within 6 week end-of-treatment visit . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month 1 year stop receiving study drug , call ask feeling . Each phone call last 5-10 minute . This investigational study . TPI 287 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment brain tumor . The use bevacizumab brain damage related tumor tissue death investigational . Up 50 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
