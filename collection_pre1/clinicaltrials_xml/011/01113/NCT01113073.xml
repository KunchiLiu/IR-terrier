	<brief_summary>Fluid administration daily intervention intensive care unit improve cardiac output ( CO ) stabilize circulation critically ill patient . Simultaneously , volume status patient difficult ass . Too little volume lead inadequate organ perfusion follow ischemia organ failure . Too much volume may worsen heart failure cause pulmonary peripheral edema contribute tissue injury organ dysfunction . Although dynamic index show accurate predictor fluid responsiveness , relevant complex task usually guide static clinical variable specialist 's interpretation due fact interpretation dynamic parameter fully develop universally available . This lack understand partially complex interaction mechanical ventilation . The investigator hypothesize know distribution ventilatory pressure make possible index dynamic parameter tidal volume improve predictive value concern volume status patient . In addition , would interest able predict fluid responsiveness non-invasive way , especially critically ill patient . Up , continuous non-invasive cardiac output monitor use Nexfin critically ill patient validate also test ability predict fluid responsiveness . The present research proposal evaluate possibility accuracy model flow analysis obtain non-invasive finger arterial pressure measurement determine fluid responsiveness use passive leg raise . It also compare invasive method ( currently use clinic ) ass ability measure absolute CO level accurately . It may make possible ass fluid responsiveness non-invasive patient friendly way .</brief_summary>
