	<detailed_description>Safety assessment tolerability assess electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . clinical laboratory test , vital sign , Adverse Event assessment , physical exam . Baseline radiographic tumor assessment , include CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis obtain . Radiologic assessment CA-125 measurement also perform every 8 week dose follow completion dose disease progression . Study visit conduct weekly first 2 cycle Day 1 subsequent cycle , Final Visit 30 day Follow-up Visit . Study visit include physical examination , complete blood count ( CBC ) chemistry . A urinalysis test perform Screening Final Visit . An ECG perform Screening , Cycle 1 Day 1 Final Study Visit . A left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) measure Echocardiogram Multiple Gated Acquisition ( MUGA ) scan subject Screening . Subjects randomize PLD arm echocardiogram MUGA perform Final Study Visit discretion Investigator throughout study . Adverse event assess every visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject must histologically ( cytologically ) confirm recurrent high grade serous ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . Subjects must least 1 platinum contain chemotherapy regimen total 3 DNA damage cytotoxic regimen last 5 year . Less full dose DNA damaging agent , possibly due reason toxicity document allergic reaction allow . Previous treatment biologics ( include catumaxomab , tigatuzumab , abagovomab , bevacizumab ) , vaccine , immunostimulants , hormonal agent , signal transduction inhibitor ( e.g. , pazopanib , sorafenib , sunitinib , temsirolimus ) allow counted towards limit 3 .
