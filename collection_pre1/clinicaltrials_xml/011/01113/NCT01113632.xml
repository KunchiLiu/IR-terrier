	<brief_summary>The risk immunosuppression deters many patient receive fludarabine , combination chemotherapy regimens poorly tolerate elderly infirm chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient . Previous study group others show rituximab safe well tolerate use single agent patient CLL . In addition , maintenance therapy rituximab well tolerated CLL patient , probable prolongation progression-free survival ( Hainsworth et al . 2003 ) . Based pre clinical clinical study indicate possible increase efficacy ofatumumab patient CLL , wish develop antibody-only regimen old patient patient refuse fludarabine-based regimen .</brief_summary>
