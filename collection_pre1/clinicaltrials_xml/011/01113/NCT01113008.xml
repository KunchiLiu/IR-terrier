	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate phenomenon remote ischemic post-conditioning human . The minor myocardial damage associate percutaneous revascularization procedure may attenuate produce controlled ischemia arm immediately carry procedure ( remote ischemic post-conditioning ) .

	<detailed_description>Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) take important role treatment ischemic heart disease recent year . However , beneficial effect revascularization partly shadow post-reperfusion injury , account half size reperfused myocardial infarct . Several drug procedure exist might protect phenomenon . One controversial strategy , show promising result experimental animal model , remote ischemic post-conditioning . This involve induce ischemia site remote heart ischemic coronary lesion reduce result myocardial infarct size . The myocardial damage produce ischemia-reperfusion associate PCI know short- long-term prognostic factor , associate great risk death , myocardial infarction revascularization follow-up . Our aim ass phenomenon remote ischemic post-conditioning patient undergo PCI , acute insult myocardium determine angioplasty . Additionally , aim evaluate phenomenon subgroup diabetic patient , among effectiveness protective measure post-reperfusion damage question . We design randomize , single-blinded interventional study involve 320 patient ( 40 % diabetic ) undergo elective PCI . At end angioplasty procedure , patient assign remote ischemic post-conditioning undergo three 5-minute cycle ischemia use blood-pressure cuff 200 mmHg , place non-dominant arm , interrupt twice 5 minute cuff deflate . In control group procedure limit place deflate blood-pressure cuff ( pressure : 0 mmHg ) 25 minute . The infarct size analyze enzyme curve troponin I CK-MB value 0 , 8 , 16 24 hour procedure ( primary endpoint ) . Measurements also take pH lactate baseline sample ( 0 hour ) 8 hour , ultrasensitive C-reactive protein 0 24 hour contrast marker inflammation ischemic heart disease . The follow-up , plan one year , seek determine clinically interesting variable ( secondary endpoint ) , readmission due acute coronary syndrome , heart failure major arrhythmic event overall cardiovascular mortality .</detailed_description>
