	<brief_summary>The investigator aim test whether beta-endorphin , substance body make response painful stressful stimulus , play causative role radiation-induced fatigue cancer patient receive radiation therapy commonly experience . If , investigator ' hope direct effort treat radiation-induced fatigue use agent block action beta-endorphin aim improve quality life patient undergoing radiation therapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants breast cancer patient receive radiation therapy Massachusetts General Hospital . There two group patient : receive adjuvant radiation therapy alone follow surgical tumor resection , receive adjuvant chemotherapy radiation therapy follow surgical tumor resection . Patients receive radiation regimen detail section 2b eligible study . In study investigator draw blood beta-endorphin measurement prior , various time , follow patient ' treatment regimen . In addition , blood draw , patient complete questionnaire assess fatigue , mood , pain . These questionnaire validate use cancer patient ( see `` Procedures Involving Human Participants section ) , study , investigator format onto computer tablet ease patient completion data analysis . This study progress follow : Patients : Patients expect receive adjuvant radiation therapy Massachusetts General Hospital approach enrollment onto study . Two group patient , chemotherapy group non-chemotherapy group , enrol follow : 1 . Adjuvant chemotherapy follow radiation therapy 2 . Adjuvant radiation therapy without chemotherapy The enrollment goal group 50 patient ( total 100 patient study ) . This calculation base approximate number 30 patient investigator need achieve sensitivity β-endorphin change 5 pM statistically significant p-value &lt; 0.05 95 % power . Based finding mouse , investigator expect β-endorphin level vary individual , investigator increase sample size 70 % calculation account deviation β-endorphin level estimation . Additionally , investigator add patient account number patient drop study , since long trial patient require multiple blood draw .</detailed_description>

Planned adjuvant chemotherapy ( regimen except biologic therapy alone ) 1 . Continuous/chronic treatment opiate/opioid analgesic 36 month prior enrollment . In addition , patient receive radiation therapy alone take opiate analgesic surgery within 72 hour postsurgery/preradiation therapy blood draw ( 16 week prior start radiation therapy ) remove study . Patients receive chemotherapy radiation therapy take opiate analgesic surgery within 72 hour blood draw prior cycle 1 chemotherapy remove study . 2 . Prior radiation therapy chest brain 3 .
