	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination Abraxane ( nab-paclitaxel ) , Gemzar ( gemcitabine ) , Avastin ( bevacizumab ) give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nab-paclitaxel , Gemcitabine , Bevacizumab Advanced Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Bevacizumab design block growth new blood vessel fee tumor . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Nab-paclitaxel designed block cancer cell divide , may cause cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level combination nab-paclitaxel , gemcitabine , bevacizumab base join study . All participant receive dose level gemcitabine . However , first group participant receive low dose level nab-paclitaxel bevacizumab . Each new group receive high dose one drug group , intolerable side effect see . The drug may dose low dose . This continue high tolerable dose combination nab-paclitaxel , gemcitabine , bevacizumab find . Up 15 dose level study drug combination test . Three ( 3 ) 4 participant enrol dose level . Once high tolerate dose find , 10 participant add dose level . This called expansion group . Study Drug Administration : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle , receive nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine vein 90 minute total . Also , first dose well tolerate , may give remain dos nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine home . On Days 1 15 cycle , receive bevacizumab vein 60 minute . Also , first dose well tolerate , may give remain dos bevacizumab home . Study Visits : Each week Cycle 1 : - Your medical history record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2-5 teaspoon ) draw test fat level blood . You need fast least 4 hour blood draw . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - You urine test perform check high level protein urine ( known side effect bevacizumab ) . On Day 1 8 Cycle 1 , physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . During Week 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2-5 teaspoon ) draw test fat level blood . You need fast least 4 hour blood draw . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) drawn see well blood clot long take blood clot . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - Females able become pregnant must negative blood ( 1 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . During Weeks 2 4 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) collect routine test . During Week 3 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - Blood ( 2-5 teaspoon ) draw test fat level blood . You need fast least 4 hour blood draw . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) drawn see well blood clot long take blood clot . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . At end every 2 cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , x-ray , CT scan , PET scan , MRI scan check status disease . If disease bone , bone scan may also do . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . You may choose stop take study drug time . You tell study doctor right away think stop participation study . The study doctor talk safely stop take study drug . This investigational study . Gemcitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type breast cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , pancreatic cancer , ovarian cancer . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal , breast , lung , brain cancer . Nab-paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer . The combination drug investigational . Up 120 patient take part study , may increase late time . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
