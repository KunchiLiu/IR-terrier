	<brief_summary>Our main goal create prospective cohort 1500 patient first large myocardial infarction allow u , second step , identify susceptibility gene progression patient towards chronic heart failure use candidate gene/candidate pathway approach . Our main hypothesis , give initial biomechanical stress ( duration ischemic episode , size infarcted area , etc . ) , variation individual susceptibility develop leave ventricular remodelling progress towards heart failure , variation link genetic variant individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research program comprise 4 phase : selection phase D0-D1 , pre-inclusion inclusion phase D4±2 , visit M6 , 5 year follow phase . Visit Day 0 - Day 1 : - The first 12-lead ECG , include observation book , perform . - The first blood sample take . Visit Day 4±2 : - The first transthoracic echocardiography perform patient select . - In presence least 3 akinetic LV segment transthoracic echocardiography , patient include . - Demographic data , medical surgical anteriority , detailed circumstance occurrence MI relevant information obtain interview . - The second 12-lead ECG perform . - The second blood sample take . - The first MRI performed ( optional ) Visit 6 month : - The second transthoracic echocardiography perform . - The third 12-lead ECG perform . - The third blood sample take . - A 24-hour Holter-ECG monitoring perform ( optional ) - The second MRI perform ( optional ) Five year follow : Each patient include day 4±2 contact phone 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 year post-MI obtain information regard cardiovascular event hospitalization . If patient contact directly , try contact member his/her family his/her family physician .</detailed_description>
