	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient often need ventilatory support plastic tube connect ventilator . Those patient alter microbiological flora mouth , oropharynx well throughout intestine . Bacteria cause illness often find oropharynx patient measure take order reduce risk secondary infection bacteria . In intensive care patient oral care provide nursing staff aim reduction pathogenic specie . This do variety measure . Chlorhexidine ( CHX ) antisepticum capability reduce bacterial count mouth oropharynx show value also intubate patient . It use frequently throughout world . Ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) costly rather frequent complication intensive care mechanical ventilation usually cause aspiration infect secretion oropharynx . CHX study show reduce frequency VAP . The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299 ability adhere mucosa throughout gastro-intestinal tract include mouth pilot study find L plantarum well ability reduce colonisation enteric bacteria oropharynx CHX . Figures statistical significant present study aim get large amount data . The procedure find safe Hypothesis : Lactobacillus plantarum good CHX reduction pathogenic bacteria oropharynx intubate mechanically ventilated patient consequently well potential reduce frequency VAP</brief_summary>
