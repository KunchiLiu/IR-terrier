	<detailed_description>MRSA SSTIs become endemic congregate community setting frequent close person-to-person contact , athletic team , correctional facility , military training facility . These infection interfere mission training soldier impair soldier ' ability participate require activity successfully complete train program . Hygiene-based prevention program ( e.g. , hand washing , environmental disinfection , community-based education ) appear effective stem outbreak MRSA SSTIs need systematical evaluate . This cluster-randomized prospective study evaluate effect hygiene-based intervention strategy incidence overall SSTI MRSA-associated SSTI among military trainee . The study population draw six training battalion , consist average six company . Each company compose four platoon consist approximately 50 trainee . Training battalion unit randomization study sub-clusters ( platoon within company ) within battalion receive hygiene-based intervention assign battalion study start . During propose 20-month evaluation period , five cycle platoon ( approximately 14 week per cycle ) enter exit training activity . In total , study population comprise approximately 36,000 trainee observe 20-month period . Each six battalion receive in-processing preventive medicine briefing augment MRSA prevention information base U.S. Army Center Health Promotion Preventive Medicine ( USACHPPM ) Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) recommendation . Additionally , trainee seek medical care SSTI receive standardize care SSTI clinic apply uniform practice guidance . Four battalion also receive supplemental SSTI education trainee drill sergeant , include standardized guidance SSTI surveillance ( e.g. , skin inspection ) drill sergeant ; trainee instruct take 10 minute shower soap every Sunday garrison ; issue personal first aid kit . Two four battalion offer chlorhexidine antiseptic body wash use Sunday shower . Endpoints evaluation ( i.e. , incident SSTIs among military trainee ) capture clinical record review completion training .</detailed_description>
