	<brief_summary>This study design test specific hypothesis explore neurophysiologic mechanism ( ) underlie pain- relieving effect immersive Virtual Reality ( VR ) non-pharmacologic pain management technique , use healthy volunteer experience carefully control thermal and/or electrical pain laboratory . Over past decade , research group perform series NIH-funded investigation VR analgesia - clinical pain laboratory pain setting - demonstrate clinical efficacy safety . In current study test pharmacologic manipulation VR analgesia ( opioid analgesia antagonist naloxone ) . We anticipate theoretical work provide foundation future clinical application immersive VR - whether use alone combination analgesic agent - make immersive VR effective widely use analgesic tool treatment clinical pain . Our previous work immersive VR indicate use painful event reduce subjective pain report acute clinical laboratory pain 20-50 % [ 1 ] . Furthermore , show effective VR analgesia associate reduce pain-related brain activity quantitatively qualitatively comparable clinically relevant dos systemic opioid analgesic [ 2 ] . The laboratory pain protocol propose current application identical UW HSD-approved protocol use previous study ( # 25296 - `` Reducing Brief Thermal Electrical Pain '' ) . What specifically different current protocol use naloxone determine whether VR analgesia operate endogenous opioid-dependent mechanism . The result study suggest mechanism action VR analgesia , also allow u effectively apply immersive VR analgesia clinically pain set thoughtful combination well-established pharmacologic analgesic technique , opioid analgesia administration . The specific aim study hypothesis test follow : To determine extent subjective analgesic effect VR analgesia inhibit opioid receptor antagonism naloxone . Hypothesis - VR analgesia inhibit systemic opioid receptor antagonism , suggest VR analgesia mediate release endogenous opiate and/or activation opioid-dependent descending central nervous system pathway .</brief_summary>
