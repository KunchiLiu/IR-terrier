	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Panobinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Giving panobinostat together letrozole may effective treatment breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose panobinostat give together letrozole see well work treat patient metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panobinostat Letrozole Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives - To determine maximum-tolerated dose panobinostat combination letrozole patient metastatic breast cancer . ( Phase I ) - To determine safety regimen patient . ( Phase I ) - To assess confirm response rate safety profile regimen patient triple-negative disease . ( Phase II ) Secondary Objectives - To assess therapeutic effect regimen patient . ( Phase I ) - To examine duration response , clinical benefit rate , time treatment failure patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To examine time progression , progression-free survival , overall survival patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - To examine estrogen , progesterone , HER2 status tumor primary compare metastatic tissue , possibly treatment . ( exploratory ) - To bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides blood product future study . ( exploratory ) - To determine expression level biomarkers treatment response ( i.e. , ER , PR , aromatase , NFkappaB , Ki67 , Caspase 3 ) accessible tumor pre- post-therapy via immunohistochemistry . ( exploratory ) - To determine whether ELISA KLK11 serum use marker activity letrozole LBH589 . ( exploratory ) The Phase I portion study close Phase II portion study open per NCCTG Addendum 6 , effective January 23 , 2012 . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I dose-escalation study panobinostat follow phase II study . ( The Phase I portion study close Phase II portion study open per NCCTG Addendum 6 , effective January 23 , 2012 . ) Patients receive oral panobinostat daily day 1 , 3 , 5 week 1-4 oral letrozole daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Tumor tissue blood sample collect banked future biomarker analysis . Samples also analyze biomarkers utilize immunohistochemistry , microarray , reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
