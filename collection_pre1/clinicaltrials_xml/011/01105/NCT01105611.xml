	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Comparing Raltegravir Protease Inhibitor Treatment-naïve , HIV/Hepatitis C Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raltegravir HIV-1 integrase inhibitor currently license use treatment-experienced HIV-1 patient recently approve use treatment-naïve patient . Recent data show virologic response patient raltegravir history antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) equal efavirenz-based therapy 96-weeks ( combine tenofovir/lamivudine ) . Moreover , raltegravir demonstrate great immunologic effect , few adverse side effect neutral effect lipid level . Further support first-line use come recent 48-week data subgroup analyse STARTMRK Phase III study compare raltegravir efavirenz-based therapy ( tenofovir/emtricitabine ) treatment-naïve patient show non-inferior virologic immunologic efficacy raltegravir . There significantly few overall drug-related clinical adverse event raltegravir group similar safety profile patient hepatitis B and/or C co-infection . These finding suggest use raltegravir component initial therapy might beneficial patient significant co-morbidities hepatitis C situation concern interaction antiretrovirals drug . Injecting drug user ( IDUs ) represent patient group formidable challenge HIV treatment . Difficulties management arise substance abuse also high rate social instability psychiatric co-morbidities . Furthermore , many patient group hepatitis C co-infection . These confound factor negatively impact adherence , ultimately efficacy treatment affect physician perception prescribe antiretrovirals . Concurrent methadone therapy complicate HIV treatment potential side effect interaction antiretrovirals . However , methadone maintenance therapy also represent important opportunity engage patient consistent medical care show improve adherence antiretroviral treatment thus viral suppression . The incidence co-infection HIV hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) IDUs high . An estimated 50-90 % IDUs U.S. co-infected HIV/Hepatitis C accord Center Disease Control Prevention . HIV co-infection aggravate natural course HCV infection . In meta-analysis effect HIV progression HCV liver disease compare mono-infection HCV , relative risk end-stage liver disease ( ESLD ) cirrhosis HIV co-infection find 6.14 2.07 , respectively . Difficulties arise treatment HIV respect HCV liver disease . Drug hepatotoxicity major concern selection appropriate antiretroviral regimen . Optimising therapy patient group necessitate balance retroviral suppression minimise hepatic side effect . Raltegravir predominantly metabolise hepatic glucuronidation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) isozyme . A small component renally excrete ( ~9 % ) . In three double-blind , randomised study pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability , raltegravir find rapidly absorbed terminal half-life 7-12 hour . It exhibit potent vitro inhibition 95 % inhibitory concentration ( IC95 ) = 33nM 50 % human serum . Pharmacokinetic analysis various dose regimen support use twice daily dose multiple dos 100mg great . Results study investigate daily dose pending . Hepatic impairment less likely affect UGT1A1 metabolism comparison liver metabolic pathway . A recent study evaluate effect liver impairment raltegravir pharmacokinetics 20 HIV-negative patient ( ten patient moderate hepatic insufficiency ten healthy , matched control ) . The geometric mean ratio ( GMR : mean value group moderate hepatic insufficiency/mean value healthy control ) 90 % confidence interval ( CIs ) area concentration-time curve time zero infinity ( AUC0- ∞ ) , maximum concentration drug plasma ( Cmax ) , concentration 12 h ( C12 ) 0.86 ( 90 % CI , 0.41 , 1.77 ) , 0.63 ( 90 % CI , 0.23 , 1.70 ) , 1.26 ( 90 % CI , 0.65 , 2.43 ) , respectively . The study author determine liver impairment produce clinically significant effect raltegravir pharmacokinetics therefore dose adjustment need mild moderate hepatic insufficiency . Protease inhibitor , atazanavir , extensively metabolise via hepatic cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A isozymes . In patient hepatic insufficiency , dose adjustment PIs consideration alternative therapy may necessary . Atazanavir also potent inhibitor CYP3A therefore potential cause drug interaction . Concerns regard adverse cardiac effect antiretroviral therapy recently emerge . Protease inhibitor associate increase risk myocardial infarction partially due dyslipidaemia . Ritonavir-boosted atazanavir commonly use part combination treatment IDUs modest effect lipid level also due simplicity daily dose . However , associate risk factor intolerability due hyperbilirubinaemia also issue . There also grow concern report long QT syndrome torsade de pointes IDUs . This patient group several risk factor increase susceptibility . Methadone well recognise cause long QT syndrome torsades de pointes inhibition cardiac potassium channel , major component encode human ether-a-go-go gene ( HERG ) . Multiple HERG polymorphism identify clinically silent may confer vulnerability arrhythmia trigger event . Protease inhibitor also potential cause QT prolongation . This may mediate direct effect HERG channel potentiate effect drug inhibition CYP3A , . Concurrent use protease inhibitor methadone might pose additive risk QT prolongation case report recently . Additionally , co-infection hepatitis C also recognise prolong QT interval . Raltegravir show effect QT interval single , supratherapeutic dose human multiple dos animal model . It also exhibit negligible inhibition HERG current vitro find little effect cytochrome P450 enzymes . In summary , efficacious virologic immunologic response , safe use hepatic impairment , non-inhibition CYP enzyme , lack QT effect , favourable lipid side effect profile indicate raltegravir could prefer option first-line treatment patient group . This study carry Phase 4 , Multi-Centre Open Label , Investigator Led , Randomised Pilot Study compare efficacy , safety tolerability raltegravir ( Isentress™ ) protease inhibitor-based therapy atazanavir/ritonavir ( Reyataz™/Norvir™ ) treatment naïve , HIV/Hepatitis C co-infected injecting drug user receive methadone . Patients attend drug treatment clinic , methadone maintenance therapy , fulfill standard criterion receive antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) meet study specific eligibility criterion invite participate study . Eligible patient , willing participate study agree comply study treatment procedure , randomize treatment either : 1 . Raltegravir 400mg PO twice daily ; 2 . Atazanavir/ritonavir 300mg/100mg PO daily 96 week treatment period . As per recommend guideline , treatment regime combine nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) backbone tenofovir emtricitabine , change due toxicity per discretion investigator medically qualify designee . The total study duration subject complete entire study approximately 100 week . During time subject attend clinic 11 study visit Baseline , Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 96 End Study Visit , 4 week post completion treatment . Subjects ' participation study end follow End Study Visit ( early withdrawal visit applicable ) . Once subject complete participation study treat per routine standard care patient population . Written inform consent obtain prior study procedure conduct . Patients initial baseline assessment prior treatment initiation . This include medical history , physical examination electrocardiogram . Baseline laboratory test include resistance profile , CD4 count , viral load , hepatitis C status , full blood count , liver blood test renal profile . Patients re-assessed 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 , 84 96 week post initiation treatment efficacy , safety , tolerability compliance .
