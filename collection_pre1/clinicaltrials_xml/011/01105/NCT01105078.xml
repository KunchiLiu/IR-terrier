	<brief_summary>Regardless development cardiac surgery technique technology , question optimal extracorporeal circulation still unanswered . There globally accept standard perfusion , however , keep many procedure evidence-based review . Generally accept flow rate cardiopulmonary bypass 2.5 L/min/m2 . This target derive physiological condition , result adapt adjustment fundamentally non-physiological process extracorporeal circulation . Among thing , increase metabolic demand re-perfusion take account . An increase optimizing standard flow rate 0.5 L/min/m2 aim investigation . Under optimal perfusion , investigator maintain microcirculation organ protection receipt endothelial function oxygen transport .</brief_summary>
