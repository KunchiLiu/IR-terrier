	<brief_summary>Background Rationale : Inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) major burden individual society . Ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ( CD ) 2 major inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . They share pathologic clinical feature overall pathogenesis resolve diagnosis sometimes difficult . The incidence rate range 3.1 14.6 case per 100,000 person year Crohn 's disease 2.2 14.3 case per 100,000 person year ulcerative colitis prevalence range 201/100,000 Crohn 's disease 246/100,000 person ulcerative colitis . Powerful biological therapy recently introduce treatment CD . They offer superior treatment treatment steroid refractory patient . Interestingly new study suggest therapy might also beneficial superior use earlier stages disease . But presently limitation treatment need consider biomarkers could better direct treatment urgently need . One present limitation new therapy , though beneficial large number CD patient , beneficial CD patient . Presently treatment responder non-responders identified prior treatment biological adalimumab represent important unmet clinical need . Since adalimumab treatment accompany serious , potentially lethal , side effect , would major advantage future biomarkers could predict whether individual respond one treatment . Furthermore treatment available associate high cost patient society , treatment adalimumab , biomarkers would help identify potential treatment-responders non-responders would support target use would appreciate stakeholder . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy method generate comprehensive metabolic profile human biofluids , metabolomic profile may useful identify biomarkers discriminative predictive power CD . Thereby amongst factor serum metabolite affect inflammation urine metabolite affect gut flora thus one combination may valuable tool CD . Aim : The investigator aim identify metabolomic predictor clinical response adalimumab treatment CD patient order direct future treatment group patient expect benefit . Methods : Metabolomic profile together collection clinical data perform patient IBD prior treatment biological therapy 6 month thereafter . In study investigator follow 50 patient Crohn 's Disease , naive treatment biologics . Metabolomic profiling perform 1 week prior treatment adalimumab every 4 week 6 month . In order reliable reproducible , sample perform morning overnight fasting period . On day serum/urine collection follow data collect : CBC , ESR , CRP , Calprotectin , ASCA/pANCA , IL-10 , TNFα , IFNγ , Crohn 's disease Activity Index , present medication OTC , Dietary lifestyle history include 24 hour dietary recall , alcohol intake , smoke exercise . Multivariate analysis perform identify pattern metabolomic profile predict response non-response adalimumab treatment . To summarize , IBD major burden patient society . Adalimumab treatment helpful steroid refractory patient . Novel biomarkers help physician decide patient might benefit adalimumab treatment may powerful tool optimize direct powerful expensive side effect bear therapy towards patient might benefit . Metabolomic profiling may tool help u identify patient .</brief_summary>
