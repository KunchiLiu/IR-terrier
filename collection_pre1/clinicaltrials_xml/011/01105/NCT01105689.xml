	<brief_summary>Background : Vitamin D play key role calcium absorption gut skeletal development . Vitamin D deficiency common , affect estimate one billion people worldwide , include developed country . Vitamin D deficiency cause rickets , common non-communicable disease childhood . Rickets cause poor growth skeletal deformity , severe , seizures death . Recent data suggest child rickets increase risk develop diabetes mellitus . Screening vitamin D deficiency commonly do . It generally diagnose symptom rickets develop . Prevention treatment simple inexpensive . Hence , early detection vitamin D deficiency screen would beneficial . Studies urgently need validate screening test . Calcium balance tightly regulate body calcium loss urine ( measure urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio ) sensitive indicator reduce calcium absorption , vitamin D deficiency . Objective Hypotheses . The objective study evaluate urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio noninvasive inexpensive screen test vitamin D deficiency . Our hypothesis 1 ) urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio correlate blood vitamin D level infants toddler risk vitamin D deficiency 2 ) test use screen vitamin D deficiency . Potential Impact . A validate screen tool would allow detection vitamin D deficiency development rickets , decrease morbidity mortality common disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Insufficient circulating level vitamin D common problem develop develop country ; estimate one billion people vitamin D deficiency time . In child , vitamin D deficiency lead nutritional rickets , consider common non-communicable disease child worldwide . Rickets cause significant short term morbidity mortality hypocalcemic tetany seizure , well long term morbidity growth delay skeletal deformity . Recent data also suggest child nutritional rickets three time likely develop type 1 diabetes . There wide agreement screen vitamin D deficiency would highly beneficial . However , debate best . Most screening effort include serum level 25-hydroxy-vitamin D parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . However , assay complex neither available affordable many vulnerable population . Calcium excretion kidney tightly regulate process involve metabolite vitamin D PTH . Renal calcium excretion , absence primary renal parathyroid gland disease , sensitive indicator total body calcium balance . We show renal calcium excretion correlate blood level 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level older child urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio show distinguish child active rickets healthy control one Nigerian study . This biomarker noninvasive assay straight forward inexpensive . We believe urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio excellent potential screening tool vitamin D deficiency . Objective Hypotheses . The objective study evaluate urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio biomarker vitamin D deficiency . Our hypothesis 1 ) urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio correlate serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level infant toddler risk vitamin D deficiency 2 ) urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio use screen child vitamin D deficiency . These hypothesis test two specific aim . Specific Aim 1 determine correlation urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio 25-hydroxy vitamin D level biomarkers rickets infant toddler increase risk vitamin D deficiency . Specific Aim 2 determine sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value one random urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio relation biochemical evidence vitamin D deficiency . Design . This observational study infant toddler increase risk vitamin D deficiency . We recruit 150 healthy child , 6 36 month age , risk factor vitamin D deficiency ( premature birth , breast feeding , dairy product avoidance , etc. ) . Based previous study US , anticipate 12 % subject vitamin D deficiency . Subjects physical exam target sign rickets . Laboratories include random urine sample calcium-to-creatinine ratio blood calcium , creatinine , alkaline phosphatase , phosphorus , magnesium , intact PTH , 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Subjects biochemical evidence rickets x-rays do left wrist knee score accord previously publish rickets score . Potential Impact . Vitamin D deficiency increasingly recognize common source morbidity develop undeveloped country . The validation noninvasive inexpensive screen tool vitamin D deficiency would allow large scale screen risk population detect problem early , prevent morbidity rickets .</detailed_description>
