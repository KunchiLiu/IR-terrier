Background / Scientific Rationale The VEW ( Vomiting , Eating , Weight Loss ) Questionnaire develop method assessment post bariatric surgery patient , well research tool eat behaviour patient .

These factor would include pain , vomiting , length meal , maladaption score , fluid add , etc . 3 . Study Population , include Inclusion/Exclusion There 507 patient eligible inclusion study . The patient include patient eligible LAGB adjustment ( thus exclude preoperative first post-operative visit ) present review treat surgeon ( single surgeon ) year 2009 . All non-gastric band non-SAGB gastric band exclude . Assessments dietitians psychologist also exclude . 4 . Study Procedures Initial Patient consent VEW questionnaire obtain consultation treat surgeon dietician expectation , benefit knowledge explain confirm . This occur prior need adjustment , , preoperative period . To date patient participate questionnaire . The VEW questionnaire hand eligible ( please see description eligibility point three ) upon arrival clinic . Patients give five minute fill questionnaire brought consultation . Patient care treatment do strict adherence Declaration Helsinki aim develop new good guideline Best Practice treatment patient LAGB . 5 . Duration Study Twelve month start 1st January 2009-31st December 2009 . 6 . Procedure Type The VEW score study limit patient LAGB specifically Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band ( SAGB ) : SAGB -VC - SABG -QC - SAGB - 2100 The VEW questionnaire use follow bariatric procedure study would limited subset patient . 7 . Primary / Secondary Safety Efficacy Endpoints Primary Efficacy Endpoints : - Optimal gastric band adjustment tailor patient pain eating , obstruction urgent deflation band - Inappropriate adjustment LAGB - Identify Decrease incidence maladaptive eating behaviour Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : - Excess Weight loss 3 , 6 , 12 month - Eating behaviour 3,6,12 month - Incidence Vomiting - Fill frequency outcome 8 . Statistical Analysis Plan Due significant amount data currently contain North Eastern Weightloss Surgery database I decide narrow parameter follow particular study : All patient break two arm , one control arm one trial arm . The outcome look : 1 . Number adjustment per patient 2 . Efficacy adjustments 3 . Excess Weight Loss ( EWL ) 4 . Eating behaviour change 5 . Food tolerance ( per Moore-Bohn Food tolerance scale ) 9 . Safety Considerations Reporting There safety consideration relate tho use VEW questionnaire</detailed_description>
