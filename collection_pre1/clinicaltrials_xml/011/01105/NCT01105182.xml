	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Combined With Chemotherapy Pulmonary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous image-guided RFA minimally invasive technique use treat solid tumour . Because ability produce large volume coagulation necrosis control fashion , technique gain acceptance viable therapeutic option unresectable liver malignancy . Recently , RFA propose viable option treatment pulmonary malignancy . Experimental study animal tumor model confirm effectiveness RFA destruction experimentally-induced pulmonary malignancy . Pilot clinical investigation suggest treatment achieve high proportion tumor response . We design prospective clinical trial aim assess feasibility , safety effectiveness RFA combine chemotherapy treatment lung malignancy .</detailed_description>
