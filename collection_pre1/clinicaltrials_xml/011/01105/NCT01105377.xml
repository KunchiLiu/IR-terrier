	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give azacitidine together entinostat work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine together entinostat may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Entinostat Treating Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine preliminary efficacy via Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response rate combination azacitidine entinostat patient metastatic colorectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore effect azacitidine entinostat time progression patient metastatic colorectal cancer . II . To assess toxicity combination azacitidine entinostat therapy . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate change promoter methylation select gene DNA circulate serum sample . II . To determine change histone deacetylase activity acetylation H3 H4 histones pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy . III . To evaluate correlation molecular effect clinical outcome ( response , time progression ) . IV . To correlate response rate RECIST criterion versus response rate determine EASL ( change tumor enhancement ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously day 1-5 8-10 oral entinostat day 3 10 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor tissue sample collect baseline periodically course 1-3 DNA methylation , histone deacetylation activity , acetylation H3 H4 histone analysis PCR , western blot , RT-PCR assay . Pharmacogenomic study may also conduct . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
