	<brief_summary>A standard treatment glioblastoma combination radiation drug temozolomide . This combination sometimes cause swell ( inflammation ) brain tissue . When standard monitoring MRI CT scan do within month finish treatment , may hard tell scan show post-treatment brain inflammation tumor growth worsen disease . Currently way definitively distinguish inflammation tumor growth biopsy . However , biopsy invasive procedure associate risk . Having non-invasive method distinguish post-treatment inflammation tumor growth help improve care patient glioma . For PET scan research study , investigator use radioactive substance call FLT ( 3'-deoxy-3'- [ F-18 ] fluorothymidine ) , instead standard substance FDG ( fluorodeoxyglucose ) . FLT get absorbed cancer cell area inflammation . Because FLT may better FDG differentiate cancer cell inflammation . An MRI scan also do time 2 FLT-PET scan do research study . The two MRI scan perform also help give information patient 's tumor routinely provide routine clinical scan , blood flow tumor metabolic activity tumor . The information special MRI scan may provide information blood supply tumor change response treatment . In addition , MRI scan along FLT-PET scan may help distinguish inflammation due radiation therapy tumor growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If eligible participate study pre-treatment FLT-PET scan within 7 day start treatment radiation temozolomide . Two intravenous catheter ( IVs ) place scan . One IV use inject FLT PET scan contrast agent MRI scan . The second IV use draw blood research test . The PET scan take 2 hour . The MRI scan take 60-75 minute . They do simultaneously . About 4 week finish radiation therapy second FLT-PET scan MRI scan .</detailed_description>
