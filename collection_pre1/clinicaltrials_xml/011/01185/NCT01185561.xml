While cardiac mortality men diabetes decline ( 13.1 % ) , 23 % increase age-adjusted cardiac mortality woman diabetes . This poor outcome , occur time significant advance management heart disease , suggest need consider direct treatment risk factor . Depression may one risk factor . Depression independent risk factor CVD , associate poor self-management decrease health-related quality life . Approximately 25 % person diabetes depression , rate depression woman diabetes double men diabetes .
