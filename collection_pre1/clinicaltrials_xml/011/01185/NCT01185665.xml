	<detailed_description>Derived folk tradition , notion rub skin painful area relief pain , find scientific support gate-control theory propose Melzack Wall 1 . Since , electrical stimulation pain relief spread worldwide . The known technique Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator ( TENS ) . Surface electrode place low back ( paravertebral level L1-L2 ) stimulation deliver high frequency low intensity ( pain threshold ) , produce intense activation Ab afferent evoke paresthesiae cover painful area . In literature TENS neuropathic pain control trial ( class II-IV ) find 2-8 . The study deal painful diabetic neuropathy very-high-frequency stimulation lower-limb muscle find efficacious standard TENS low-frequency TENS acupuncture-like efficacious sham stimulation . Studies deal peripheral mononeuropathy find standard TENS good placebo . One crossover , small-sample study ( class III ) painful cervical radiculopathy find standard TENS apply cervical back well placebo TENS random frequency variation superior7 . For chronic back pain benefit find TENS compare TENS-sham use VAS outcome measure , benefit find compare exercise exercise ( Class I ) 9 . In another Class I study , TENS v TENS-sham study patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic low back pain . After correction multiple comparison , significant difference VAS secondary measures10 . Both study adequately power find least 20 % difference pain reduction VAS TENS TENS-sham . But article benefit find chronic back pain treat TENS11,12 . Therefore recent report Therapeutics Technology Assessment Subcommittee American Academy Neurology recommend TENS treatment chronic low back pain due lack proven efficacy TENS consider treatment painful diabetic neuropathy 13 In study design , investigate feasibility efficacy TENS subgroup patient neuropathic pain . Those patient suffer neuropathic pain lower back leg spinal surgery predominance pain leg .</detailed_description>
