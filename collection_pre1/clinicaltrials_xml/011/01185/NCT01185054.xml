	<brief_title>Is Electrolyte Maintenance Solution Required Low-Risk Children With Gastroenteritis ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastroenteritis remain major cause morbidity amongst Canadian child . The primary treatment focus revolve around use Oral Rehydration Therapy ( ORT ) treat dehydration replace intravascular volume . Since diarrheal disease Canadian child usually result mild dehydration minimal sodium loss , use low sodium Electrolyte Maintenance Solutions ( EMS ) become standard care . However , give North American child infrequently develop severe dehydration , unclear routine use EMS justify . When pediatrician directly dispense EMS , 16 child need treat prevent 1 unscheduled office visit , however upper bound 95 % confidence interval astound 508 patient . In addition , EMS consider prohibitively expensive , 15 % pediatrician believe expensive patient purchase . An additional 40 % report taste major barrier consumption . As result , oral fluid replenishment often underutilized IV rehydration employ instead . Our goal provide evidence guide selection optimal ORT fluid low-risk child , thus increase use , enhance success , reduce reliance intravenous rehydration . We hypothesize strict adherence EMS use low-risk child may actually counterproductive result reduced fluid intake potentially increase use intravenous rehydration .</detailed_description>
