	<brief_title>SJ-0021 ( Gonalef® ) Versus Purified Pituitary Gonadotropin ( Fertinorm-P® ) Ovulation Induction Japanese Infertile Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) heterodimeric glycoprotein wherein alfa subunit beta subunit noncovalently bond . Follicle stimulate hormone one key hormone regulate reproductive function female male mammal , include human . In female , stimulates development ovarian follicle , carry oocyte , male promote spermatogenesis . Synthesis secretion FSH stimulate gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) , hypothalamic peptide . Complete partial deficiency FSH secretion common cause infertility men woman . In woman , state characterize absence ovulation abnormal ovulation . In men , lead absence abnormally low production spermatozoon . Administration FSH , either alone combination luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , use successfully treat infertility problem . Until recently , human menopausal gonadotropin ( hMG ) , mixture human LH FSH extract urine post-menopausal woman , purify FSH ( u-hFSH ) , could use reduce LH content , available treatment infertility . In Japan , hMG u-hFSH still use induce ovulation . Purified pituitary gonadotropin , use comparator drug clinical trial , urinary gonadotropin preparation . However , classify hMG , rather purify pituitary gonadotropin ( u-hFSH ) , preparation commonly use Japan . Since LH content u-hFSH low , administer relatively safely , adequate care take , patient polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) . SJ-0021 recombinant human FSH ( r-hFSH ) produce use Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell host cell . The generic name SJ-0021 follitropin alfa injection , market overseas GONAL-f® . It approve Japan January 2006 effective induce spermatogenesis case male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( MHH ) . OBJECTIVES - To examine efficacy SJ-0021 versus purify pituitary gonadotropin ovulation induction follicle development subject amenorrhea I anovulatory cycle , verify non-inferiority SJ-0021 versus comparator drug - To assess safety SJ-0021 This clinical trial comprise pretrial observation period , treatment period [ IMP administration period ] , post-treatment assessment period . The clinical trial schedule way spontaneous menstruation withdrawal bleeding induce progesterone administration occur within 28 day completion baseline test conduct pretrial observation period . A visit trial site schedule day Day 2-5 spontaneous menstruation withdrawal bleeding , actual registration subject randomization pre-administration test perform . After completion pre-administration test , 75 IU either SJ-0021 purify pituitary gonadotropin allocate subject subcutaneously administer day ( dose Day 1 treatment period ) , daily dose maintain first 7 day treatment period . On dose Day 8 , mean diameter dominant follicle measure ; &lt; 11 mm , daily IMP dose increase 37.5 IU new daily dose administer next 7 day . If mean diameter dominant follicle ≥ 11 mm &lt; 18 mm , ( previous ) IMP dose administer next 7 day . If mean diameter dominant follicle already reach 18 mm , administration IMP terminate , subject move post treatment assessment period . Similarly , mean diameter dominant follicle &lt; 11 mm dose Day 15 Day 22 , dose increase ; ≥ 11 mm &lt; 18 mm , administration continue previous dose , ≥ 18 mm IMP administration terminate . The maximum dose IMP administer 187.5 IU/day maximum dosing period IMP 28 day . In addition Day 8 , Day 15 Day 22 , ultrasound examination conduct twice week treatment period , base status growth dominant follicle ( every visit dominant follicle achieve maximum diameter 16 mm ) . Examinations first day post-treatment assessment period conduct , appropriate , day mean diameter dominant follicle reach ≥ 18 mm day dose Day 28 IMP . The hCG cancellation criterion ( i.e . four ovarian follicle mean diameter ≥ 16 mm ) also verified time . If hCG cancellation criterion meet , single dose 5000 IU hCG administer intramuscularly , within 24 hour last ultrasound examination . Mid-luteal phase test conduct Day 6 ± 1 Day 9 ± 1 post-treatment assessment period , final examination perform Day 28-31 post-treatment assessment period . If pregnancy test ( urine ) conduct final examination positive , pregnancy test ( ultrasound examination ) perform Day 35-42 post-treatment assessment period . On hand , mean diameter dominant follicle remain &lt; 16 mm day dose Day 28 IMP , hCG cancellation criterion meet , hCG administration withheld , examination first day post-treatment assessment period well final examination Day 28-31 post-treatment assessment period perform accordingly .</detailed_description>
