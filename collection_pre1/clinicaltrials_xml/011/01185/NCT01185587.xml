	<detailed_description>Scientific Background Significance Introduction : Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) represent major health care concern United States . It estimate approximately 5 million patient U.S. CHF , nearly 550,000 people diagnosed disease annually.1 It known sudden cardiac death occur frequently set structural heart disease . Moreover , risk sudden cardiac death 6 9 time great heart failure population , cardiac arrhythmia perhaps leading cause death CHF patient . 2,3 Currently , American College Cardiology American Heart Association endorse placement internal cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) patient ischemic cardiomyopathy , reasonable life expectancy , reduce ejection fraction 40 % ( class I , level evidence A ) .4 Additionally , placement ICDs recommend non-ischemic cardiomyopathy patient meet similar requirement ejection fraction le 35 % ( class I , level evidence B ) .4 Despite recommendation primary prevention sudden death way ICD implantation , half patient receive device likely experience arrhythmic event necessitates ICD shock delivery.3 ICD device , average , cost $ 20-50,000 exclusive operative follow cost . Currently , risk stratification sudden cardiac death need ICD placement essentially dependent upon assessment leave ventricular ejection fraction . Other method employ risk stratification signal average electrocardiogram ( ECG ) another electrocardiographic technique know T-wave alternans . Although method FDA approve risk prediction cardiac death , technique widely employ U.S. give equipment personnel cost implement . Thus , alternative test risk assessment development sudden cardiac death heart failure population desirable . Role Sodium Channels SCN5A Gene : The cardiac voltage-gated sodium ( Na+ ) channel , SCN5A , main channel generate current electrical propagation heart muscle target many antiarrhythmic drug . Defective expression cardiac Na+ channel result increase arrhythmic risk evidence sudden death Brugada Syndrome.5 SCN5A mutation also implicate inherited long-QT syndrome , result development fatal dysrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation torsades de pointes.6 Additionally , mutation SCN5A gene also propose exist enhance risk drug-induced dysrhythmias.7 Many study do shed light role tetrodotoxin-insensitive sodium channel disease state . It demonstrate mutated sodium channel dilate cardiomyopathy may function differently depend upon specific mutation type principal Na+ channel alpha-subunit.8 Specifically , Nguyen et al demonstrated mutation may lead change physiological function slow action potential rise time , enhance late sodium current steady state , impair inactivation.8 Additional mutation SCN5A gene link shifts voltage dependence Na+ channel inactivation patient idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.9 Additional research conclude decreased inactivation late sodium current may contribute action potential prolongation.10 A different SCN5A gene abnormality , E161K mutation , show lead decrease sodium current density 11.9 mV positive shift cell membrane half-maximal activation potential.11 Therefore , mutation Na+ channel cause alter channel behavior arrhythmia . Valdivia et al . demonstrate peak sodium current density reduce 39 % dog model , approximately 57 % explanted failing human heart , although mechanism unclear.10 Though understanding electrophysiological change heart failure relationship arrhythmogenesis remain unclear , inferred disruption sodium handle - perhaps increase intracellular sodium - may also result change calcium homeostasis via action Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.12,13 Overall , change INa likely significantly contribute arrhythmia set fail myocardium . At genome level , research focus role SCN5A gene mutation arrhythmogenesis.8,9,14-16 Nevertheless , recently describe acquire defect Na+ channel messenger RNA ( mRNA ) result reduce Na+ current occur failing heart . Three 3'-terminal SCN5A mRNA splice variant identify characterized fail human heart ventricle . These splice variant predict result translation nonfunctional sodium ion channel lack appropriate domain IV pore region . These three splice variant nonfunctional sodium channel gene product denote E28B , E28C , E28D . Relative level full length mRNA isoform , E28A , decrease 24.7 % patient CHF compare control . Additionally , two truncate version gene product increase heart failure patient , reflect acquire genetic abnormality production SCN5A gene heart failure . At time , E28C E28D mRNA abundance increase 14.2 fold 3.8 fold respectively CHF patient compare control . In order confirm truncation variant could contribute arrhythmic risk , gene-target mouse model create nonsense mutation exon 28 . The electrophysiological effect presence gene truncation also examine . It find action potential rate rise reduce ( p=0.02 , n=11 ) , action potential amplitude reduce 76 ± 1.4 mV 52 ± 0.6mV ( p≤0.01 , n=11 ) . Integrated effect truncation study examine bipolar field potential ( FP ) cardiomyocytes microelectrode arrays.17 A 70.5 % reduction ( p &lt; 0.05 ) -1126 ± 314 μV ( n=6 ) WT 332 ± 174 micro V ( n=7 ) FP amplitude observe . Additional measurement do method reveal delay FP rise slow conduction velocity mutant cell versus normal control , suggest truncation mutant could cause electrical abnormality severe enough contribute arrhythmic risk . Also , show lymphocytes process sodium channel similarly cardiomyocytes . Thus , lymphocyte SCN5A mRNA processing may serve surrogate marker ass SCN5A cardiac level may correlate arrhythmic risk high risk population . This study assess assertion . Specific Aims/Objectives : Research Aim 1 : To determine abundance SCN5A mRNA splice variant patient CHF baseline ejection fraction less 35 % versus normal control similar age group .

Levels mRNA measure processed sample may store -80° F freezer Lab 7 year . Samples NOT store process JBVAMC facility . Statistical consideration : The relationship Na+ channel mRNA variant abundance compare subject without heart failure subject without ICD event . The primary endpoint comparison mRNA variant abundance . Dependent variable include heart failure aim 1 number shock aim 2 . The number patient need aim determine variance test , mean difference expect , consideration number covariates need analyze regression analysis . Previously , show least sensitive measure reduction E28A abundance 24 % . If assume percentage reduction happen aim 1 2 , would need 45 patient group 90 % power detect difference , assume 10 % loss rate due technical error assay . Therefore , would need total 180 patient total trial , 45 heart failure , 45 control , 45 ICD patient event , 45 patient without event . Baseline data express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) continuous variable , frequency categorical variable . Differences baseline characteristic group examine use Fisher exact Mann-Whitney test categorical continuous variable , respectively . Because number ICD event record function observation time , Poisson regression use model relationship . In model , number ICD event observe assume distribute follow Poisson distribution . That , give period time , probability certain number event occur function event rate multiply duration observation . In order estimate effect mRNA variant rate event occurrence , assume event rate log linear respect predictor interest . Solving equation give rate ratio compare rate event occurrence subject without ICD event . Multiple expression mRNA variant abundance consider , relative abundance variant individually , abundance individual variant function total Na+ channel mRNA , ratio truncation full-length Na+ channel mRNA . The regression coefficient estimate relationship dependent variable , ICD event , independent variable log rate ratio estimate . Statistical significance determine use likelihood ratio test . A p-value 0.05 less take statistically significant . Results report risk ratio associate 95 % confidence interval . In order select variable include model , consider , conservatively , variable different distribution two group p &lt; 0.20 . The possibility multicolinearity evaluate . Linear non-linear term consider . Normality variable distribution test normal probability plot Shapiro-Wilk test . While regression fairly tolerant violation regard , transformation investigate necessary . Homoscedasticity evaluate plot residual versus predict value . Discrimination model evaluate overall C index validate bootstrap method . Anticipated Results Pitfalls : We anticipate complication acquire blood sample , analyze mRNA variant , perform statistic . Nevertheless , major limitation trial retrospective nature . Nevertheless , data useful design future prospective trial .</detailed_description>
