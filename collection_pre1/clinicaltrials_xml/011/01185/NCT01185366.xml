	<brief_title>Everolimus Versus Sunitinib Non-Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Everolimus design stop cell multiply . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , may cause tumor cell die . Sunitinib design block pathway control important event ( growth blood vessel ) essential growth cancer . Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) 1 2 group . - If assign Group 1 , take 2 everolimus tablet mouth every day . - If assign Group 2 , take sunitinib capsule mouth every day 4 week , follow 2 week . If side effect drug , tell study doctor right away . The study doctor may lower dose keep dose level . Every 6 week study call study `` cycle . '' If disease get bad intolerable side effect study , chance receive study drug receive first . The dose follow-up participant group . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test fast blood sugar test . Blood urine also use pregnancy test woman able child . If Group 1 , additional 1 teaspoon blood drawn test cholesterol . On Day 15 29 Cycle 1 : - Your vital sign weight measure . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If Group 1 , additional 1 teaspoon blood drawn measure cholesterol . The Day 15 Day 29 test may do local doctor 's office . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 , every cycle ( Day 1 Cycle 5 , 7 , 9 ) : °You CT scan chest CT scan MRI abdomen check status disease . Every 4 cycle ( 24 week ) : °If Group 2 , echocardiogram MUGA scan check heart 's health . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefit . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Treatment Visit : If stop take study drug intolerable side effect , treat physician make every effort check status disease take study . Long-Term Follow-up : Once longer study , research staff check every 6 month . This update consist phone call review medical and/or record . You extra test , procedure , study visit . If contact phone , call would last 5 minute . This investigational study . Sunitinib everolimus FDA approve commercially available treatment advance kidney cancer . Up 108 patient enrol multicenter trial . Up 108 patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
