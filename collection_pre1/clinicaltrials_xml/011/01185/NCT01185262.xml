	<brief_summary>The rationale combine lenalidomide rituximab derive preclinical observation suggest lenalidomide may enhance ADCC ( antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ) trigger monoclonal antibody rituximab . Lenalidomide augments NK cytotoxicity increase CD56dimCD3 subset , addition induce IL-2 T cell . These result provide cellular molecular basis use lenalidomide adjuvant immunotherapeutic strategy monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) -based therapy . The combination lenalidomide-rituximab tested lymphoma cell line specifically CLL cell line . However observe synergism attribute NK cell expansion , thus lend support notion synergism may operate B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy . The objective develop non-cytotoxic effective treatment CLL would fulfill unmet medical need , significant proportion CLL patient elderly frail . These patient experience excess chemotherapy induced toxicity , often prevent completion plan treatment .</brief_summary>
