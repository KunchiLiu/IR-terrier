	<detailed_description>1 . Study Design . 1.1 . Patient population . More 500 coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) perform annually Jackson Memorial Hospital ( JMH ) , main teaching hospital U M School Medicine . The study coordinator work close collaboration Dr. Ricci , Co-Investigator . Dr. Ricci , work cardiac surgeon division , screen patient schedule CABG , satisfy eligibility criterion list invited participate . Over period 37 month ( study month 4 41 ) 500 patient recruit initially randomize 2 group : one ( n=250 ) receive conventional PRBC ( unwashed PRBC ) ( n=250 ) PRBC deplete MP ( wash PRBC ) . Approximately 50 % CABG require PRBC transfusion surgery approximately 25 % surgery . The patient population classify follow subgroup : subgroup 1 ( n=100 ) , surgery transfusion PRBC ; subgroup 2 ( n =100 ) , surgery transfusion wash PRBC ; subgroup 3 ( n =200 ) , without transfusion ; subgroup 1a ( n =25 ) , surgery post-surgery transfusion PRBC ; subgroup 1b ( n =25 ) , transfusion surgery post-surgery transfusion PRBC ; subgroup 2a ( n =25 ) , surgery post surgery transfusion wash PRBC ; group 2b ( n =25 ) , transfusion surgery post-surgery transfusion wash PRBC . The comparison major interest study Subgroup 1 vs. 2 , approximately 100 patient . -- Those require transfusion ( Subgroups 3 , n ≈ 200 ) serve `` pure comparison '' group . The remain patient require post surgery transfusion ( ) . The characteristic patient group 1a , 1b , 2a , 2b outcome ascertain included ancillary analysis . It anticipate small proportion patient require one post-surgery transfusion . Data pertain 2nd , 3rd , etc post-surgical transfusion collect used descriptive purpose ancillary statistical analysis . 1.2 . Protocol Transfusion Algorithm Washed PRBC Group . General Considerations Potential study participant screen satisfy exclusion criterion , include patient know platelet dysfunction coagulopathy , eligible trial . Once informed consent sign , eligible candidate randomize either two approve transfusion practice : normal PRBC 's washed PRBC 's . For patient randomize normal PRBC group , usual blood bank procedure transfusion follow pre- , intra- , post-operative period . For patient randomize washed PRBC group , follow general rule place : Rule 1 : PRBC 's washed prior surgery avoid delay transfusion . Rule 2 : The Blood Bank must notify minimum 1 hour prior transfusion , wash PRBC 's need surgery . Rule 3 : Safety never compromise standard care applicable blood transfusion requirement coronary artery surgery patient preserve . In emergency situation , normal PRBC 's transfused , enough time PRBC washing . 1.3 . Blood sample . Blood sample ( two tube citrate Vacutainers ) obtain patient prior induction anesthesia , 1 hour completion surgery , 1 7 day surgery . Blood sample cod follow : • BSa1 , sample take induction anesthesia • BSa2 1 hr post surgery • BSa3 1 day post-surgery • BSa4 7 day post surgery • Residual sample every PRBC bag transfuse , include remain tubing , obtain MP profile . 2 . Main objectives clinical study . The study design study major transfusion complication rare . The study biochemical physiologic host response two type PRBC main interest . They assess sensitive assay previously describe . Among patient show abnormal test result , small fraction expect manifest clinically evident complication . The main objective clinical study asses response compare describe subgroup 1 , 2 3 respect : 2.1.Subclinical physiologic host response include endothelial disturbance , procoagulant proinflammatory response , oxidative stress ; 2.2 . Minor subtle post-transfusion reaction alteration vital sign , cardiac disturbance , respiratory disturbance , O2 saturation ; addition , short-term ( &lt; 30 day ) complication cardiac surgery . 2.3 . A third aim ass correlation laboratory biomarkers clinical outcome ( minor transfusion reaction , short-term surgical outcome ) , gain insight mechanism underlie adverse effect transfusion surgical complication . This generate useful data test combination test best predict risk complication transfusion surgery , regardless whether find attributable RMP . 2.4 . A fourth aim assess mortality rate one year surgery . This do telephone , e-mail , regular mail contact patient next kin . 3 . Patient recruitment ; Randomization ; pre-operative perioperative care . 3.1 . Preoperative evaluation recruitment patient . As normal part preoperative evaluation , cardiac surgery patient undergo complete medical history physical examination , routine laboratory test prior surgical procedure ( include CBC , platelet count , chemistry , blood coagulation , lipid profile , CRP , blood group ) , cardiac evaluation include 2-D echocardiography cardiac catheterization . All patient schedule CABG JMH screen eligibility . Medical record patient review , follow preoperative information evaluate entered study data base : ( 1 ) Demographic characteristic include age , sex , race , blood type , body surface area ( m2 ) ; ( 2 ) cardiac information : NYHA class I-IV , EKG , echocardiogram ejection fraction ; ( 3 ) preexist medical condition : hypertension , diabetes , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , renal function , liver function , prior history MI , stroke , peripheral vascular disease , thrombosis . Patients satisfy eligibility criterion list invited participate study . The study coordinator assist Co-I entire process recruitment follow-up study . Prior study enrollment , write informed consent obtain accord UM-IRB guideline . 3.2 . Randomization . Once informed consent sign , participant initially randomize receive either packed red blood cell ( PRBC ) wash packed cell ( WPRBC ) . The randomization schedule prepare Dr. Gomez use block randomization scheme vary block size . Copy randomization schedule provide study coordinator blood bank . Dynamic randomization scheme : To prevent potential imbalance two main group due effect patient require transfusion , dynamic randomization scheme design . Briefly , randomization schedule design assign prospective patient sequentially receive either wash unwashed packed cell ( PC ) . However , patient require transfusion surgery , patient reassign Group 3 ( non-transfusion ) simply skip queue , next patient assign position queue ( since position use due transfusion ) . 4 . Laboratory assessment . Overview . Subclinical physiologic response ( biomarkers ) follow transfusion assess laboratory study . Broadly , focus interest sensitive marker endothelial disturbance , procoagulant , proinflammatory , vasoactive oxidative stress . 4.1 . Routine blood test include CBC , platelet , reticulocyte count , blood chemistry , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , lipid profile , DIC screen test hemolysis . 4..2 . Plasma MP . Total MP measure FITC-labeled lectin , Ulex ; RMP GlyPhA ; PMP CD41 CD42+/CD31+ ; others note . 4.3 . Endothelial disturbance . ( See Table C.1 ) . Performed assay endothelial MP ( EMP ) use marker CD62E CD31+/CD42- EMP conjugate . 4.4 . Procoagulant activity : All follow reflect aspect procoagulant activity : platelet activation marker CD62P ; platelet MP ( PMP ) CD42 ; total MP AnV+ ; total MP TF+ ; MP-mediated thrombin generation ( MP-TGA ) ; Thrombin-antithrombin complex ( TAT complex ) . 4.5 . Inflammatory marker . The following select informative . ( ) Leukocyte MP ( LMP ) flow cytometry : LMP accept many investigator reflect leukocyte activation , i.e. , inflammatory marker . ( ii ) CD11b expression leukocyte subset . Widely accept sensitive marker leukocyte activation inflammation . It simple sensitive assay .
