	<brief_summary>Accurate detection heart attack ( acute myocardial infarction ) one press need medicine . Recordings electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( electrical activity heart ) one first tool use diagnose heart attack , ECG accurate , especially begin heart attack . A new technique analyse special part ECG may provide accurate detection heart attack . The study hypothesis new technique , HFQRS analysis , provide important additional information available regular ECG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Usefulness High-frequency QRS Analysis Evaluation Patients With Chest Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chest pain one leading reason hospital emergency department ( ED ) visit worldwide . In United States ( US ) , 6 million people annually undergo evaluation ED acute chest pain . Despite wealth knowledge available acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) , condition continue among difficult predict diagnose . Nearly half patient hospitalize unstable angina eventually receive non-cardiac-related diagnosis . Nonetheless , 2-8 % patient myocardial infarction ( MI ) inappropriately discharge ED mortality rate among patient MI mistakenly send home disproportionately high ( 25-33 % ) among patient admit . Although ECG mainstay management suspect ACS , major limitation sensitivity specificity diagnosis ACS . The initial 12-lead ECG ED often non-diagnostic ACS patient , especially non-ST elevation MI ( NSTEMI ) unstable angina ( UA ) , therefore rule-out ischemia infarction . Elevation serum biomarkers usually detectable 4-6 hour MI , patient show biomarker elevation long 12 hour . Consequently , new clinical tool early risk stratification patient acute chest pain sought . Conventional analysis ST segment deviation aim detect repolarization abnormality . However , ischemia may also bring change depolarization phase electrical cardiac cycle . These depolarization change detect quantified use analysis high-frequency component QRS complex ( HFQRS ) . HFQRS analysis previously report sensitive method detection demand ischemia exercise test . Preliminary study show HFQRS-derived index also identify supply ischemia cause prolonged balloon occlusion , transient ischemic episode patient chest pain .</detailed_description>
