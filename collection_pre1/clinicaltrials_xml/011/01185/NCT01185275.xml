	<brief_title>A Prospective Observational Study Biopredictors Bronchial Thermoplasty Response Patients With Severe Refractory Asthma ( BTR Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim To assess relationship baseline clinical , physiologic , biologic image marker response bronchial thermoplasty , define improvement asthma quality life , patient severe refractory asthma . Secondary Aims 1 . To assess relationship baseline clinical , physiologic , biologic image marker response bronchial thermoplasty , define reduction severe exacerbation healthcare utilization , patient severe refractory asthma . 2 . To evaluate baseline clinical , physiologic , biologic image marker related safety bronchial thermoplasty patient severe refractory asthma . 3 . To evaluate validate statistical model predict response bronchial thermoplasty patient severe refractory asthma .</detailed_description>
