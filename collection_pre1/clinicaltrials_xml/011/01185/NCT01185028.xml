	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) major health problem particularly affect individual human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , lead cirrhosis liver failure . Standard treatment people HIV CHC 48-week course pegylated-interferon alfa 2a ( peg-IFN ) ribavirin ( RBV ) , good treatment need either respond drug relapse treatment . - Nitazoxanide approve Food Drug Administration primarily treat diarrhea cause parasite , study treatment CHC infection . However , test person infect HIV CHC co-infection . Researchers interested determine whether nitazoxanide safe tolerable treatment CHC individual HIV . Objectives : - To assess safety tolerability use nitazoxanide treat chronic hepatitis C infection individual HIV respond standard treatment hepatitis C. Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose HIV chronic hepatitis C , either respond relapse previous hepatitis C treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history ; blood urine test ; image study ; possible heart , lung , psychological test ; liver biopsy one do past 3 year . - Participants receive nitazoxanide , medication study , take mouth 4 week , provide blood sample time . - After 4 week , participant receive first dose peg-IFN RBV . Participants weekly injection peg-IFN continue take nitazoxanide RBV mouth 48 week . Individuals slow respond combine CHC treatment ( nitazoxanide , peg-IFN , RBV ) week 12 continue combine treatment extended period , total 72 week . - Participants study visit provide blood sample test two time first month combine treatment , month 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 19 ; month 25 participant slow respond combine treatment . - Some participant specific HIV treatment regimen may enroll substudy require three separate 12-hour visit repeat blood sample test initial 4-week nitazoxanide treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Nitazoxanide HIV-HCV Treatment Failures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C ( CHC ) viral infection major health problem affect 130-170 million worldwide , 2.7-3.9 million US , 3 time HIV infection . One-third person HIV CHC , rapid progression cirrhosis liver failure , liver disease one lead cause mortality . Standard treatment , pegylated-interferon ( IFN ) alfa ribavirin ( RBV ) , efficacy , sustain virologic response ( SVR ) , less 50 % HCV genotype 1 ( GT 1 ) ; 25 % HIV-HCV GT1 co-infection . SVR even low retreat , prior treatment relapsers non-responders ; publish study exist , especially HIV . Improved therapy imperative give increase morbidity mortality proportion person relapsers non-responders . Newer promise anti-HCV therapy , directly act antiviral ( DAA ) , development . However , 2 Phase 3 clinical trial remain far FDA approval . An oral agent , nitazoxanide ( NTZ ) , broad vitro anti-microbial activity good safety profile , high efficacy rate treatment na participant mono-infected HCV GT 1 4 . There study HIV co-infected person , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study liver renal disease . In vitro study suggest NTZ direct suppressive effect HCV replication , well sensitize effect IFN-mediated suppression HCV replication , yet exact mechanism action give rise high SVR rate well understood . This open-label study 35 HIV-HCV GT 1 co infected person , prior relapsers ( n=25 ) non-responders ( n=10 ) full course IFN RBV therapy . Participants receive 4 week NTZ lead-in therapy , follow NTZ/peg-IFN/RBV triple combination therapy additional 48 week . Slow responder receive 72 week triple therapy 4-week NTZ lead-in . The primary endpoint safety tolerability NTZ . Secondary endpoint exploratory : ( 1 ) efficacy rate estimation , ( 2 ) viral dynamic assessment , determination predictive response , ( 3 ) pharmacologic level assessment , ( 4 ) indirect mechanistic action evaluation NTZ virologic response , , ( 5 ) IFN-stimulated genetic expression evaluation determination predictive response . There sub-study evaluating PK NTZ group 10 participant ritonavir-based HIV antiretroviral regimen .</detailed_description>
