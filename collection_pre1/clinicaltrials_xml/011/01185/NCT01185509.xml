	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see effect trastuzumab combination vinorelbine breast cancer participant circulate tumor cell positive protein call HER2 . Trastuzumab FDA approve drug target HER2 . The drug combination trastuzumab vinorelbine effective treatment patient breast cancer positive HER2 . This trial seek determine combination also benefit participant whose original breast cancer HER2 negative whose circulate tumor cell HER2 positive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants receive two different drug . Trastuzumab administer vein every 3 week . Participants receive high dose trastuzumab first day treatment follow low dose subsequent administration . Vinorelbine administer vein week . - Each treatment cycle last 3 week time participant receive Vinorelbine weekly Trastuzumab every 3 week . Participants continue receive Vinorelbine weekly Trastuzumab every 3 week long cancer grow experience severe side effect . - Circulating tumor cell ( CTCs ) collect study entry , 6 week one week prior , study treatment stop . - ECHO MUGA scan perform study entry repeat 18 week need . - CT MRI perform study entry repeat every 6 week first 18 week every 12 week thereafter .
