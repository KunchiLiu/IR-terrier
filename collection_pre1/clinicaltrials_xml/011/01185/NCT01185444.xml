	<brief_title>Efficacy Three Weekly Injections Bacterial -- Sourced Hyaluronate Pain Function Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis ( OA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Viscosupplementation intra-articular hyaluronate injection safe effective treatment knee osteoarthritis . There several form hyaluronate different origin , method production , molecular weight , dose instruction possibly clinical outcome . Most current hyaluronate product avian origin , bioengineered via bacterial fermentation . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety 3 weekly injection bacterial-sourced hyaluronate ( Hya-Joint ) patient knee osteoarthritis . Methods : As prospective randomize observer-blind study do university-affiliated tertiary care medical center , patient knee osteoarthritis least 6 month enrol . Eligible patient randomize receive three weekly intraarticular injection either bacterial-sourced hyaluronate ( Hya-Joint ) avian-derived hyaluronate ( Hyalgan ) target knee . The primary outcome visual analog scale ( VAS ) change baseline knee pain 6-month follow-up . Secondary outcome measure include Lequesne index , time go test ( TUG ) , patient ' global satisfaction analgesic consumption . Results : A total 95 participant randomly assign 89 participant complete study . Both group significant improvement pain early 1 2 week first injection , pain-reduction effect could last 6 month , between-group difference . The Lequesne index score result TUG test improve significantly baseline group follow-up visit ( p &lt; 0.001 test compare baseline ) , significant between-group difference 1-month 6-month follow-up . However , significantly great improvement favor Hya-Joint group note 3-month follow-up ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . No between-group difference see regard use analgesic . Both group report high satisfaction 6-month follow-up . No serious adverse event occur . Conclusions : Three weekly injection hyaluronate ( Hya-Joint ) safe well tolerate , provide rapid pain relief early 1 2 week first injection , improve function patient knee osteoarthritis . The treatment effect last 6 month .</detailed_description>
