	<brief_summary>This phase I study compare safety immunogenicity candidate tuberculosis ( TB ) vaccine MVA85A administer intramuscular route intradermal route healthy adult individual previously vaccinate Bacillus Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tuberculosis Vaccine , MVA85A , Administered Intramuscular Route Intradermal Route</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We postulate intramuscular route inferior intradermal route administration MVA85A BCG vaccinate adult evaluate safety immunogenicity . If MVA85A give safely intramuscular route least equally immunogenic efficacious prime-boost strategy , would probably prefer route subsequent phase II III trial . There several reason : - Reduced pain associate injection . - Reduced local reaction injection site . - More straightforward procedure ; le technically demand ; less time consume . - Easier production storage vaccine . - Larger volume vaccine give . Trials MVA85A date establish 1 x 10^8 pfu optimal dose intradermal injection adult . We therefore intend administer dose intramuscularly order directly compare two route safety immunogenicity . These result guide future trial intramuscular route , safe , could evaluate either high low dose depend immunogenicity 1 x 10^8 pfu dosage .</detailed_description>
