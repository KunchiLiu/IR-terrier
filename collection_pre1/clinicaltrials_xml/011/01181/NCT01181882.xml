	<detailed_description>A recent increase incidence prevalence obesity-related diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome result insulin resistance threaten reverse health gain achieve US last half 20th century . Novel inexpensive safe pharmacologic approach require prevent variety result cardiovascular disease sequela . Aspirin proven agent treatment prevention cardiovascular disease greatly underused . Even use , aspirin ineffective large proportion population : problem term `` aspirin resistance . '' Approximately thirty percent adult US population aspirin resistant proportion high diabetes metabolic event affect patient benefit antiplatelet drug . The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) naturally occur safely use low cost individual high low cardiovascular risk group . Supplementation EPA DHA ( EPA + DHA ) modify fatty acid balance distribute patient insulin resistance atherosclerosis , thereby potentially improve endothelial function , lower blood pressure , reduce risk fatal non-fatal acute coronary syndrome . Emerging evidence indicate combination aspirin together EPA+DHA supplementation beneficially regulate fatty acid metabolism attenuate atherosclerosis . However , effect aspirin together EPA + DHA aspirin resistance subject diabetes mellitus insulin resistance unknown . Circulating EPA DHA contain largely lysophospholipids , contain three carbon backbone variable fatty acyl side chain . In preliminary data , show aspirin ingestion EPA+DHA supplementation lysophospholipids include lysophosphatidylcholine ( LPC ) lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA ) know bind specific G-protein couple receptor , explore novel therapeutic target cardiovascular disease . Relationships LPC LPA metabolism , aspirin ingestion , human atherosclerosis investigate ( knowledge ) . In proposed study , investigate effect combine aspirin EPA+DHA supplementation platelet function lysophospholipid metabolism clinical trial individual type 2 diabetes mellitus . This trial build exist infrastructure clinical translational research , well preliminary data use novel in-house assay .</detailed_description>
