	<brief_summary>This study design compare traditional Colonoscopy CT Colonography , commonly know `` virtual colonoscopy '' . The study compare ability procedure screen test identify polyp colon patient average risk develop polyp . The patient preferences procedure assess mean standardized questionnaire . As well ability observer differ level experience read CT scan detect polyp compare . All patient receive CT scan traditional colonoscopy day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computed Tomography ( CT ) Colonography Versus Optical Colonoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose To study Effect Experience Training Accuracy CT ( Computed Tomography ) Colonography Comparison Optical Colonoscopy Detection Colonic Neoplasia 2 . Hypotheses 1 . The accuracy ( sensitivity specificity ) interpretation CTC image improve 100 scan examine . Less time require interpret CTC image successive 100 scan . The accuracy observer similar . 2 . The sensitivity specificity similar CTC OC last 100 patient undergoing examination . 3 . Patients prefer CTC OC base comfort ease procedure . 4 . CTC add benefit identify extra-colonic finding find OC . CTC perform low cost per patient low complication rate OC take similar amount time perform . 3 . Justification Screening believe decrease incidence colorectal cancer death result detection precancerous lesion cancer early stages4-6 . Fecal occult blood test flexible sigmoidoscopy miss substantial number significant lesions7 . Despite risk , inconvenience , cost , optical colonoscopy primary screen tool colorectal cancer perform every 10 year , begin 50 year age people average risk8,9 . Screening also recommend young age population increase risk10 . Virtual colonoscopy rapidly evolve technique data compute tomography ( CT ) use generate two-dimensional three-dimensional display colon rectum . This minimally invasive method examination colon , also refer CT colonography ( CTC ) , promise alternative optical colonoscopy use widespread screening , require intravenous administration sedative analgesia little recovery time . Many study seek compare utility CTC optical colonoscopy ( OC ) detection colonic polyp adenocarcinomas various patient population . Before CTC use usual practice training require interpreting study need studied guideline create define requirement necessary prior implementation screen strategy . 4 . Study Objectives : To determine effect previous train experience accuracy polyp cancer detection CTC patient average risk colorectal cancer . 1 . To assess learn curve GI radiologists ( experienced experience CTC interpretation ) , GI fellow family physician acquire experience read CTC datasets measure detection rate , miss rate amount time need read image 1st , 2nd 3rd set 100 CTC 's interpret . 2 . The study also determine sensitivity specificity CTC compare OC detection colonic polyp ( various size ) adenocarcinoma patient high risk colorectal cancer ( 45 year age family history colorectal cancer , positive screening test suggestive symptom ) . 3 . Patient satisfaction CTC OC evaluate mean patient questionnaire . 4 . The two procedure compare term complication rate , time require perform test , extra-colonic finding cost perform procedure per patient . 5 . Research Method A non-randomized , evaluator blind study 300 consecutive patient high risk colonic neoplasia refer colonoscopy . Each patient undergo standard colonoscopy preparation day prior CT Colonography ( CTC ) follow within 2 hour optical colonoscopy ( OC ) . Patients men woman age 19 - 65 year schedule undergo elective colonoscopy refer suburban primary care set . Study population The study participant consist two main population . The first include patient average high risk colonic neoplasia eligible screen colonoscopy . Average risk patient age 45-65 wish undergo screen colorectal cancer . High risk patient include family history colorectal cancer , previous colorectal cancer neoplasia , positive screening test ( Fecal Occult Blood ( FOBT ) , flexible sigmoidoscopy , digital rectal exam air contrast barium enema ) patient gastrointestinal symptom sign ( abdominal pain , rectal bleeding , anemia ) . Patients recruit suburban primary care medical clinic Coquitlam , B.C . ( North Road Medical Centre ) refer gastroenterology clinic downtown Vancouver ( Pacific Gastroenterology Associates ) recruit gastroenterology clinic directly . Ethical approval obtain University British Columbia St. Paul 's Hospital Institutional Review Boards . A study investigator obtain informed consent potential study participant . Design After obtain informed consent , participant instruct consume clear liquid diet 24 hour prior exam . Patients receive detailed instruction regard bowel preparation use oral Picosalax Bisacodyl suppository take day prior procedure ( see Appendix 2 ) . Instructions also provide regard intake oral barium gastrograffin use stool tag agent ( see Appendix 2 ) . As CTC OC take place day , preparation identical procedure . No sedative agent administer CTC . Colonic distention CTC achieve automate low-pressure delivery carbon dioxide . Patients allow sip clear fluid morning examination keep without oral intake CTC OC complete . CT Colonography Patients give appointment time presentation St. Paul 's Hospital radiology department . After report , ask change hospital gown CT scanning perform . Images acquire use GE Lightspeed 64 row multidetector CT scanner . Slices obtain 0.75mm resolution reconstruct use GE Healthcare software resolution 1.25mm . Scans obtain single breath hold use low radiation exposure protocol ( ~30-50 mAs corresponds absorb radiation dose 3-5 mSv ) . The quality adequacy image assess patient leave radiology department await colonoscopy perform within 2 hour . Interpretation There 2 radiologist reader experience gastrointestinal image one experienced CTC interpretation . The Radiologists review scan record finding 4 separate envelope , one section colon ( rectum sigmoid , descend , transverse right colon ) . The size lesion find recorded optimum view use electronic calliper . Finally , radiologist review film extra-colonic finding record separately . Similarly , GI Fellow Family Physician review scan record finding manner . However , least one Radiologist review film time examination ensure adequate quality provide interpretation prior OC . The amount time take read film reviewer record total time read view patient . Observers make aware optical colonoscopy result 100 procedure . Optical Colonoscopy Within 2 hour finish CTC imaging , participant undergo OC conscious sedation use combination midazolam Demerol fentanyl achieve patient comfort . An experienced gastroenterologist use Olympus colonoscope perform colonoscopy . The endoscopist , blind CTC result examine colon withdrawal endoscope , record finding four segment colon . Each segment sequentially unblinded allow endoscopist review Radiologists find colonic segment CTC . Polyps detect endoscopy remove use standard technique ( biopsy forceps snare cautery ) submit pathological assessment . Advanced neoplasms divide pathology adenocarcinoma polyp . Polyps categorize accord size ( ≤5mm , 6-9mm ≥10mm ) . Morphologic characteristic lesion also record viewer sessile , pedunculated flat . Lesion size determine measurement remove lesion ( fixation ) estimate endoscopy comparison biopsy forceps , lesion remove . Patient Questionnaires Following endoscopy , patient transfer recovery area undergo monitor vital sign follow standard practice guideline , ready discharge . Immediately prior discharge , patient give 10 question write survey , self-completion ( see appendix 1 ) . The recovery room nurse give final consultation Gastroenterologist recovery room . Patients give much time necessary complete survey instruction seal survey envelope return nurse prior leave recovery room . In order ass test/retest reliability survey , random sample patient mail second survey ( identical first ) 3 - 4 week day examination . Enclosed instruction self-completion survey self address , postage pay , return envelope allow return . 6 . Statistical Analysis The reference standard polyp detection result OC colonic segment re-examined CTC result know . Tests accuracy sensitivity , specificity , true positive true negative result comparison reference standard . ROC curve CTC OC derive test complete . The AUC test ' ROC curve use compare accuracy two test . ROC curve AUC statistic derive dataset divide accord 100 CTC perform reader evaluate learning curve test . Tests significance McNemar 's test , pair t-tests , chi-square test appropriate . Interobserver reliability report kappa statistic .</detailed_description>
