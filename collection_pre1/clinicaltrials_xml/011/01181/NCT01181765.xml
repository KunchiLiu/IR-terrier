	<brief_title>The Efficacy Open Label Infliximab Induction Maintenance Mucosal Healing Small Bowel Crohn 's Disease Assessed Through Wireless Camera Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Landmark trial Crohn 's disease demonstrate efficacy infliximab induce maintain clinical remission . Furthermore , endoscopic sub-studies within trial demonstrate ability infliximab rapidly induce maintain mucosal heal evidence complete absence mucosal break colon terminal ileum . Unfortunately , conventional colonoscopy allow intestinal exploration beyond restricted portion small bowel ( 10-15 cm terminal ileum ) . A study systematically examine change small bowel mucosa Crohn 's disease symptomatic improvement clearly need . This study consist 20 subject 30 week follow . All subject undergo wireless camera endoscopy three ( 3 ) visit , namely : Screening , Week 10 Week 26 . Infliximab administer ( 5 ) visit , namely : Baseline ( week 0 ) , Week 2 , Week 6 , Week 14 Week 22 . In subject , ileal-colonoscopy may perform Week 26 .</detailed_description>
