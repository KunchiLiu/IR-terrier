	<brief_summary>Magnesium second abundant ion human cell play fundamental role several enzymatic reaction : involve ATP production , phosphorylation protein , glucose metabolism contraction cytoskeleton . Several epidemiological study demonstrate low dietary magnesium intake inversely associate diabetes mellitus , hypertension metabolic syndrome . Magnesium could relate important haemodynamic metabolic anomaly : vascular level act antagonist calcium , especially vascular smooth muscle cell , thus deficit could enhance vascular contraction ; regard glucose metabolism , magnesium involve physiopathological mechanism insulin resistance , reduction cellular uptake glucose . This condition subsequent compensatory hyperinsulinemia ultimately lead increase synthesis proinflammatory cytokine endothelial dysfunction . Thus , magnesium depletion subsequent alteration increase risk develop vascular disease atherosclerosis associate cardiovascular event . Several clinical trial explore possible beneficial effect magnesium supplementation blood pressure , plasma lipid insulin resistance result often contradictory . One possibility unclear result could interventions start late haemodynamic metabolic change difficult revert . The investigator hypothesis magnesium supplementation population increase genetic risk develop metabolic syndrome without could improve blood pressure metabolic syndrome related component . Thus , aim present study evaluate effect oral supplementation magnesium ( 16.2 mmol/day magnesium pidolate ) metabolic syndrome 's component sample 15 subject increase risk develop metabolic syndrome since positive familiar history type II diabetes mellitus and/or metabolic syndrome ( AHA/NHLBI criterion ) .</brief_summary>
