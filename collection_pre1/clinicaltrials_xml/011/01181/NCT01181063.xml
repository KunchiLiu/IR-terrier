	<brief_summary>Due complexity orally inhale product ( combination formulation device ) topical nature drug delivery lung efficacy vitro-in vivo correlation ( IVIVC ) inhale dosage form generally know . The rationale pilot study gain vivo data Budesonide/formoterol EH product variant development compare pulmonary deposition ( administration charcoal ) different product variant Budesonide/formoterol EH Symbicort TH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order reduce variability , crossover design chosen . An open study design regard appropriate study pilot primary study variable pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter derive drug concentration plasma . Wash-out period least 3 day study treatment administration day consider sufficient elimination budesonide formoterol . The single dose study suitable kind study , aim compare product therapeutic response measure . The dose level select 2 inhalation ( single dose ) product . The administration 2 inhalation enable determination budesonide formoterol concentration plasma . In study investigational product administer concomitantly oral charcoal block GI absorption ass pulmonary deposition active substance . Comparison pulmonary deposition product consider relevant systemic exposure point product development . In pivotal PK study total systemic exposure also assess . Blood sample formoterol analysis collect 24 hour budesonide analysis 12 hour dose cover least 80 % total area concentration-time curve time zero extrapolate infinity ( AUCâˆž ) .</detailed_description>
