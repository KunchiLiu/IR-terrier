	<brief_summary>Transepithelial CXL ( perform without epithelial removal ) seem similar clinical effect keratoconic eye compare standard CXL ( include epithelial removal ) . The current study attempt prove hypothesis . A prospective , control , randomize , contralateral trial , involve one eye patient treat transepithelial CXL , control eye treat standard CXL . Totally 20 patient ( age &gt; 18 &lt; 40 year ) refer ophthalmologist eye department University Hospital North Norway CXL treatment bilateral progressive keratoconus , recruit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transepithelial Corneal Collagen Cross-linking ( CXL ) Treatment Keratoconus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CXL appear hinder development keratoconus strengthen cross-bindings corneal stroma resultant increase corneal biomechanical strength 300 % . The method introduce mid-nineties approve use EU country since 2007 . Standard treatment protocol , involve removal corneal epithelium Riboflavin application , use . In order avoid potential complication follow removal epithelium ( infection , delay healing , scar formation , well discomfort pain ) , modified procedure epithelium keep intact , call transepithelial CXL , suggest . According preliminary result publish retrospective study , significant difference clinical effect standard CXL epithelial removal transepithelial CXL found .</detailed_description>
