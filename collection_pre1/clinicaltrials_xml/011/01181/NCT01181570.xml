	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect safety adalimumab approximately 20 subject mild moderate psoriasis sleep apnea conduct one treatment center locate Montreal . Patients psoriasis often additional disorder obesity . Obese patient risk develop obstructive sleep apnea . This believe caused collapse upper airways inflammation ( swell ) . Adalimumab , drug currently approve Health Canada treatment psoriasis , block tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) . This chemical present high level patient sleep apnea . It believe adalimumab could improve obstructive sleep apnea lower level TNF-alpha .</brief_summary>
