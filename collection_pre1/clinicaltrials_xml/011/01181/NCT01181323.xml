	<brief_title>Post-Partum Immunization With Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine ( LAIV ) Trivalent Influenza Vaccine ( TIV ) Post-Partum Breast Feeding Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due limit data available safety immune response live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) breast-feeding woman lack information induction immunoglobulin ( Ig ) A IgG influenza virus breast milk , study compare safety mother infants immunogenicity mother standard dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV ) LAIV administer 28-120 day delivery breastfeed woman . This multi-site , randomize , double-blinded trial 240 post-partum breastfeeding woman , 18-49 year age infant . Once enrol , blood sample breast milk sample collect . Nasal swab obtain targeted physical examination ( TPE ) conduct mother infant , indicated . Each subject receive either single intramuscular ( IM ) 0.5 milliliter ( mL ) dose TIV 0.2 mL placebo administer intranasally , 0.2 mL intranasal dose LAIV 0.5 mL placebo administer IM . All subject maintain memory aid record oral temperature , systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 8 day study product administer . Approximately day 2 8 subject return clinic collection breast milk sample nasal swab ( mother infant ) memory aid review . Approximately Day 28 vaccination , subject return clinic breast milk blood sampling . During time vaccination day 28 visit , mother infant influenza-like illness ( ILI ) , clinic visit may require within 72 hour illness onset . The clinic visit require illness meet Centers Disease Control Prevention 's definition ILI mother . Investigator discretion discern illness infant require ILI visit . Any respiratory gastrointestinal ( GI ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) infant also require clinic visit . If mother ILI , nasal swab collect , sample infant ( possible ) . If infant ILI , nasal swab collect mother infant . At approximately Day 42 vaccination , subject phone call assessment medically attend GI respiratory illness infant Day 29-42 . Approximately 6 month vaccination subject phone call assessment SAEs subject infant since Day 42 . SAE data new onset chronic medical condition mother collect Day 0-180 . At study visit , subject ask acute , temporary breast disease ( mastitis , abscesses ) change breastfeed , i.e. , interruption , long ( week ) . Subjects report information current breast milk consumption infant . Unsolicited non-serious AE data capture Day 0-28 . Respiratory GI AEs capture infant Day 28-42 . SAE data capture Day 0-180 mother infant . Blood sample test hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) , IgG , IgA measure enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . Breast milk sample assay IgA IgG antibodies ELISA . Breast milk nasal swab also test LAIV . Parent protocol sub-study 11-0048 .</detailed_description>
