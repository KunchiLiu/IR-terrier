There total 8 clinic visit 1 telephone contact . Screening : determined 3 month +/- 7 day prior subject ' first dose Avonex Day 1 , time screen MRI without Gd-enhancement perform . Treatment Period : consists eligible patient undergo pre-dosing assessment receive first dose Avonex day 1 . Subjects brain MRI within 48 hour prior first injection Avonex . Weekly dose open-label Avonex 30mcg IM administer 24 consecutive week total 25 injection per subject . Subjects caregiver allow self-inject successful completion appropriate IM injection training . Subjects return clinic week 6 , 12 , 18 24 safety laboratory assessment ( include blood sample collection pharmacodynamic ( neopterin ) immunogenicity test ) , clinician injection site assessment . Subjects undergo brain MRI without Gd enhancement week 12 week 24 . Subjects perform injection site pain assessment day 1 week 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 record result visual analog scale . Subjects prematurely discontinue Avonex may remain study continue protocol-scheduled visits/evaluations ( exception subject clinician injection site assessment neopterin sample collection . Subjects experience new worsening symptom suggestive MS relapse neurological worsen visit within 5 day follow onset symptom . Treatment confirm MS relapse follow protocol-specified regimen .
