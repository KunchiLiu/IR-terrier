	<brief_title>The CIRCADIAN Study : Evaluation Modulating Effect Galantamine Circadian Rhythm Patients With Mild Moderate Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot , single-group , interventional , prospective study include patient moderate Alzheimer 's disease , treat galantamine . Galantamine think benefit cognitive function Alzheimer 's disease . The start treatment dose 8 mg/day 4 week . The initial maintenance dose galantamine 16 mg/day . Patients maintain 16 mg/day 4 week . An increase maintenance dose 24 mg/day consider individual basis appropriate assessment include evaluation clinical benefit tolerability . For individual patient show increased response tolerate 24 mg/day , dose reduction 16 mg/day consider . The primary objective assessment modulate effect galantamine ( Reminyl PRC ) circadian rhythm ( wake/sleep ) patient moderate Alzheimer 's disease . The secondary objective ass perception physician , caregiver patient sleep-wake disorder patient moderate Alzheimer 's disease treatment galantamine . Sleep disturbance assess two actigraphy measure : one , start treatment , , 12 week first actigraphic measure . The primary endpoint day/night ratio measure actigraphy treatment galantamine patient moderate Alzheimer-type dementia . Concerning Efficacy Measures , Actigraphy use method ass modulate effect galantamine circadian rate . The impact modulate effect caregiver , patient physician assess three questionnaire : Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview ( ZBI ) , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , respectively . Patient safety monitor . It estimate study period range September 2010 second quarter 2011 .</detailed_description>
