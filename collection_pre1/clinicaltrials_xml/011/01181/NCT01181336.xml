	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether single vaccination ( injection ) investigational influenza vaccine safe healthy subject . The study also design evaluate four different dose formulation vaccine see give best immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1b Influenza Vaccine Study Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prophylactic vaccination influenza indicate `` risk '' population include patient suffer chronic respiratory disease ( include asthma ) , chronic heart disease , chronic renal failure , diabetes mellitus immunosuppression due disease treatment . Vaccination elderly ( &gt; 65 year ) resident nurse home also recommend . The current influenza vaccine available contain subunit two influenza A virus influenza B virus consist either inactivated whole virus subunit haemagglutinin neuraminidase . The investigational influenza vaccine ( FLU-v ) contain multiple highly conserve T cell epitopes present influenza virus , identify reactive different human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) population ; thus make unlikely anybody vaccinated population would unable mount immune response least one epitope contain vaccine . This study initial exploration FLU-v human , aim assess safety , tolerability , immunogenicity healthy subject . Subjects randomise receive either Low Dose High Dose FLU-v without adjuvant , placebo without adjuvant . Twenty-four ( 24 ) subject randomize Low Dose 24 subject High Dose . To mitigate risk , stagger dose approach use . One subject receive Low Dose FLU-v without adjuvant , one subject receive placebo without adjuvant , follow 6 hour later one subject receive Low Dose FLU-v adjuvant , one subject receive placebo adjuvant . All 4 subject observe overnight . At least 72 hour later absence clinically-significant safety signal ( determine Safety Review Committee ) remain 20 subject Low Dose group dose . If deem appropriate Safety Review Committee second sentinel cohort 4 subject observe overnight prior complete remain subject Low Dose group . Following satisfactory review safety data combine Low Dose cohort , subject High Dose group vaccinate use staggered dosing approach use Low Dose .</detailed_description>
