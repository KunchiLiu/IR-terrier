	<detailed_description>This prospective observational study usual care patient undergo treatment schizophrenia bipolar I disorder CBHOs . Up 50 CBHOs select site study . Treating clinician site notify designate research coordinator study initiate patient new antipsychotic medication ( include risperidone long act injectable paliperidone palmitate ) treat patient risperidone long act injectable paliperidone palmitate . New initiation include patient previously antipsychotic medication well switch one antipsychotic another . Switches may include limited switch among different type oral antipsychotic , oral antipsychotic Long Acting Therapy ( LAT ) , LAT oral antipsychotic .

The target enrollment study 2,450 participant . Enrollment cohort monitor site notify stop enrollment target enrollment particular cohort reach . Eligible participant consent study recruit one two sample : participant schizophrenia diagnosis ( target n=2,250 ) participant bipolar I disorder diagnosis ( target n=200 ) . There four cohort : risperidone long act injectable new start ( target n=475 ) ; risperidone long act injectable continuous user ( target n=75 ) ; paliperidone palmitate new start continuous user ( target n=1,200 ) ; antipsychotic new start ( target n=700 ) . During entire study follow-up period participant receive medication per usual care treatment set study drug provide . Enrolled participant follow prospectively 12-month study period , interview baseline , 6 12 month . Sites also abstract medical history healthcare utilization information chart enrol participant . There three chart abstraction ( baseline , 6 Months , 12 Months ) . The baseline abstraction cover service render 6 month prior antipsychotic initiation switch , first visit CBHO individual receive service long 6 month prior initiation switch . The 6M 12M abstraction cover service render prior 6 month . When three abstraction complete , data cover period 6 month baseline 12 month baseline . If Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) associate J &amp; J medicinal product occur investigator record source document well fax SAE form J &amp; J internal safety group within 24 hour .
