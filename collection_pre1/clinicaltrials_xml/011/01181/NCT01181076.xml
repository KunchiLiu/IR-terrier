	<brief_summary>Aim Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( allo-SCT ) combine several cycle intensive chemotherapy curative treatment several malignant blood disease . Most allo-SCT patient treat intensive chemotherapy often reduce nutritional status . Several study evaluate effect different nutrition intervention allo-SCT patient , find evidence-based recommendation energy requirement , use enteral nutrition ( EN ) and/or parenteral nutrition ( PN ) . We aware study use QoL end-point among allo-SCT patient allocate specific nutrition intervention . Main hypothesis : Patients receive individualize nutrition well `` global '' QoL assess European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) QLQ-HDC29 tool three month SCT Sub-hypotheses : Patients receive individualized nutrition : ) less often oral mucositis grade 3-4. ii ) good nutrition status iii ) decrease length hospital stay , less episodes fever , earlier engraftment less often acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) grade 3-4 , iv ) good main QoL score scale physical social function , fatigue , loss appetite , nausea/vomiting diarrhoea three month allogeneic SCT , compare control group . Patients methods A minimum sample 100 patient include study . The patient enrol study randomly assign intervention- control group . The patient intervention group receive therapeutic diet combination tube feed additional PN estimate requirement enteral route low reference value . The patient control group receive nutrition support establish routine , first oral route , later PN route .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients method A minimum sample 100 patient include study . This result power calculation difference 15 global QoL primary end-point . All patient fulfil inclusion criterion offer allo-SCT myeloablative condition invite participate study 1-3 month commence treatment . The patient give write informed consent participate study . The patient enrol study randomly assign block intervention- control group . The main end-point three month SCT . We follow patient throughout first year SCT . Nutrition intervention The intervention start patient arrive hospital SCT consist individualized nutrition supplement patient discharge . The severity nausea , vomit , diarrhea mouth soreness measure administration route nutrition ( oral , PN and/or EN ) . The energy requirement calculate intake monitor . The energy intake continuously adjust energy requirement . The patient able achieve oral nutrition requirement receive therapeutic diet use regular food , lactose-reduced energy-enriched . The naso-jejunal tube insert first five day transplantation . EN give oral intake discontinue , additional PN give estimate requirement enteral route low reference value . Dislodged tube promptly replace two time stomach . If tube dislodge two time , voluminous diarrhea appear , patient refuse tube , patient nourish PN route . The patient intervention group receive dietary recommendation leave hospital . The patient control group nourish establish routine , first oral route , later PN route . Naso-jejunal tube insert enteral nutrition give . Measurement quality life , mucositis nutrition status The patient score EORTC QLQ-C30 form admission , i.e . 8 day prior SCT , 3 6 week 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . At time measure follow several marker nutritional status parameter hemostasis . We also record routine clinical parameter well anthropometry body composition use electrical bioimpedance . WHO Oral Toxicity Grading Scale use measure oral mucositis . In addition use Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment ( PG-SGA ) .</detailed_description>
