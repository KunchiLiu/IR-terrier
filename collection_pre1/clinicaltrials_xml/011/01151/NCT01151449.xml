	<brief_title>Gamma-secretase/Notch Signalling Pathway Inhibitor RO4929097 Treating Patients With Advanced , Metastatic , Recurrent Triple Negative Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumour activity RO4929097 recurrent and/or metastatic triple negative breast cancer co-primary endpoint overall response rate ( ORR ) use RECIST 6-month progression-free survival rate ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumour activity RO4929097 secondary endpoint include : duration radiologic response , progression-free overall survival rate within protocol define follow-up period . II . To assess safety tolerability single agent RO4929097 breast cancer . III . To explore expression Notch biomarkers triple negative breast cancer potential interaction RO4929097 response toxicity . IV . To evaluate downstream effect RO4929097 advance triple negative breast cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
