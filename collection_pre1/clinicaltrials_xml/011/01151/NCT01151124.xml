	<brief_summary>The study design test safety manufacture neural stem cell line ( CTX cell ) deliver injection damage brain male patient 60 year age remain moderately severely disabled 6 month 5 year follow ischemic stroke . In addition trial evaluate range potential efficacy measure future trial . Treatment involve single injection one four dos CTX cell patient 's brain carefully control neurosurgical operation perform general anesthetic . The trial design treat 12 patient measure outcomes 24 month . Patients invited participate long-term follow-up trial 8 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : The trial open label , single administration , ascend dose , single site trial use CTX neural stem cell 24-month patient monitoring follow treatment . Pre-treatment selection patient : Males age â‰¥60 year unilateral ischaemic stroke affect sub-cortical white matter and/or basal ganglia 6 month 5 year prior entry study , persistent unilateral hemiparesis , minimum infarct diameter 1 cm stable neurological functional deficit determine NIH Stroke Scale , ( measure twice least 1 month apart ) , eligible treatment . Treatment : The CTX cell inject stereotaxic procedure putamen region brain patient general anesthesia image guidance locate injection site . Four ascend dos CTX cell test 12 patient ( 4 dosage group three patient dose level receive 2 million , 5 million , 10 million 20 million cell ) . Patients admitted hospital day surgery prepare CTX cell implantation take place . Patients discharge two day surgery . One patient treat time . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) make decision continue dose dose level follow satisfactory review 28 day safety data first patient dose level ; increase dose next level follow satisfactory review 3 month safety data three patient previous dose group . Post treatment follow-up patient : There 6 schedule visit clinic monitor neurofunctional test 5 schedule telephone contact monitor adverse event ( AEs ) concomitant medication 2 year follow-up period . End-points : The primary end-point trial safety , measure number relevant Serious Adverse Events , health screening , neurological assessment scan abnormality . The secondary aim evaluate various MRI test measure potential efficacy marker subsequent trial . Post trial follow : All trial patient flag National Health Service Central Register ( NHSCR ) Scotland life-long follow-up . In addition , patient invite take part 8-year follow trial require annual review suitable physician .</detailed_description>
