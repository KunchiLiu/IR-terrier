	<brief_title>C1-INH Compared Placebo Time Prodromal Symptoms Hereditary Angioedema ( HAE ) Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Section 3 Study Design Methods : Our proposal perform randomize double-blind , three-arm , three-way cross-over study subject HAE would place one three different treatment group base computer randomization . Subjects randomize receive placebo , 1000 unit , 1500 unit C1-INH onset prodromal symptom although would blind one receiving . Randomization one two dos placebo sequence treatment determine randomly double-blinded fashion person involve study . The randomized drug available 24 hour 7 day week . They would come study office receive blind drug , would need seek treatment within 6 hour onset prodrome . Following blind treatment , subject would need observe least 30 minute . If subject develop acute HAE exacerbation three treatment period , would access 20 units/kg open label C1-INH acute treatment also receive study office , time onset symptom acute attack time subject seek open-label treatment could exceed 12 hour . Following open label rescue , subject would need observe least 1 hour symptom start improve . The subject would also expect complete symptom diary card next 24 hour receive open-label C1-INH monitor severity duration symptom ( 24 Hour Prodrome/Open-Label Diary Appendix IV ) associate acute attack . The number , duration , severity acute HAE attack would compare treatment period . Each treatment period would last 16 week subject would study total 48 week . Because safety establish C1-INH use every third day prophylaxis therapy , patient may receive C1-INH attack without limit closeness attack , patient study may retreat prodromal symptom require , every day since prodrome may precede swell abdominal pain 2 day . Thrombosis identify C1-INH , neonates premature much high dos 1500 unit every third day . Cinryze , also C1-INH , FDA approve 1000 unit every third day prophylaxis . The dosing use study reflect FDA approval dose Berinert , 20 unit per kg acute therapy , patient receive 1000 2500 unit C1-inh whenever attack without day restriction dose . The dosage approve FDA 20 unit per kg Berinert 1000 unit total dose Cinryze . The dose use study approximate dos , FDA approve dose . There limit often Berinert dose acute attack . Figure IV outline treatment protocol . Figure IV : Three-arm , randomize , cross-over , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine effect treat prodromal symptom C1-INH infusion 1000 unit , 1500 unit versus placebo . The sequence random double-blinded .</detailed_description>
