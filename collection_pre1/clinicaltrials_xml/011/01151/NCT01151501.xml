	<brief_summary>Acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure ( AHRF ) refer pathological state arterial blood oxygenation severely impaired，and need invasive positive pressure ventilation ( IPPV ) respiratory support technique cases.However，IPPV carry well-known risk complication ventilator induce lung injury ( VILI ) ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) ，and incidence increase prolongation IPPV lead high mortality rate . Consequently，early extubation extraordinarily necessary . More recently , NPPV show shorten duration IPPV，reduce mortality morbidity rate patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Despite evidence , efficacy NPPV patient AHRF evidence . However，NPPV show provide adequate ventilation oxygenation，and reduce inspiratory muscle effort，neuromuscular drive，and dyspnea score . Moreover，to patints，NPPV similar IPPV providing oxygenation . The duration wean first day patient meet standard criterion wean readiness time successful extubation ( last least 48 h ) ，which represent 40-50 % total duration IPPV.As result，duration IPPV would shorten wean shorten . The investigator hypothesize mechanical ventilated patient AHRF meet standard criterion wean readiness suffer failure spontaneous breathe trial , use NPPV early extubation , provide adequate ventilation oxygenation , would shorten duration IPPV primary end-point variable , thereby reduce incidence complication mortality rate . Accordingly , investigator conduct prospective，randomized clinical trial ass efficacy strategy compare conventional-weaning approach .</brief_summary>
