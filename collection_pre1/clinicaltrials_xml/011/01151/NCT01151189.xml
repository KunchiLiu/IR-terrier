	<detailed_description>This Phase II multi-country trial conduct randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 650 HIV-positive adult evidence active TB disease . Subjects stratify time randomization whether receive anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) randomize ratio 1:1 receive either MVA85A/AERAS-485 1 x 10^8 plaque form unit ( pfu ) placebo ( Candin ) . Randomization group cap least 50 % subject randomize receive ART randomization . Subjects receive intradermal injection MVA85A/AERAS-485 placebo Study Day 0 , follow 6-9 month later booster injection MVA85A/AERAS-485 placebo . The minimum follow-up period subject 6 month last vaccination , subject follow safety , clinical sign symptom TB , immunogenicity . All subject continue follow every 3 month last subject enrol follow 6 month last vaccination .</detailed_description>
