	<brief_summary>- There data present concern KRAS mutation patient Martinique colorectal cancer . Despite fact incidence disease continue increase recent data confirm . This study descriptive purpose , allow comparison population Martinique population . - A study incidence colorectal cancer , overseen Association Martinique Epidemiological Search Cancer ( AMREC ) , also lead well knowledge local characteristic colorectal cancer . - These two descriptive characteristic colorectal cancer Martinique useful data health professional provide patient good care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KRAS Mutation Incidence Colorectal Carcinoma Martinique Between 2007 2009</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The colorectal carcinogenesis complex . It influence among others , EGFR ( Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ) activation lead tumoral proliferation , differentiation invasion . The binding EGF ( Epidermal Growth Factor ) another ligand EGFR responsible activation Ras- Raf Pi3k pathway . - The mutation gene KRAS , BRAF PIK3CA result continuous activation , independently activation pharmacological blocking EGFR . The frequently find mutation affect KRAS gene ( 20 50 % case ) . 90 % mutation situate codon 12 13 gene ( 70 % codon 12 30 % codon 13 ) . These mutation responsible decrease GTPase activity ra protein , stay active conformation bound GTP . This lead block pathway inactivity pharmacological blocking EGFR .</detailed_description>
