	<brief_summary>Computed tomography ( CT ) scan , perform contrast enhancement , one commonly request examination diagnostic imaging . In patient elevate creatinine allergy contrast agent , scan may perform without benefit contrast enhancement . Ultrasound ( US ) , perform contrast agent enhancement nephrotoxicity may perform patient CT contrast allergy . The investigator propose US Contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) superior unenhanced CT scan population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Ultrasound Replace Computed Tomography ( CT ) Scan Those Unable Have Computed Tomography ( CT ) Contrast Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast enhance compute tomography ( CT ) one common investigation perform radiology department , use widely evaluate pathology part body . Historically , well know use contrast agent CT scan may result nephropathy , renal failure . Nephrotoxicity associate injection CT contrast agent may occasionally occur healthy individual commonly borderline renal function . If abnormal kidney function know exist patient send CT scan , examination perform without valuable assistance contrast enhancement . Further , prior hypersensitivity contrast agent CT scan know , , scan perform without use contrast agent . Ultrasound ( US ) perform conventionally grayscale Doppler able evaluate abdominal pelvic organ also provide vascular information relate large vessel blood flow . Contrast enhance ultrasound ( CEUS ) provide precise information blood flow available Doppler show comparable CT scan circumstance . We believe comparison conventional US , CEUS , unenhanced CT scan would clearly favor ultrasound detection soft tissue pathology basis inherent tissue contrast differentiation .</detailed_description>
