	<brief_summary>Cluster headache ( CH ) primary headache disorder characterize recurrent short-lasting attack ( 15 180 minute ) excruciate unilateral periorbital pain accompany ipsilateral cranial autonomic sign . The 1-year prevalence CH 0.1 % , male : female ratio 3:1 . The majority patient cluster period week month frequent attack alternate symptom-free period month several year ; episodic CH . In 10 % patient CH chronic ( CCH ) either remission occurs within 1 year remission last less 1 month . At least 10 % CCH patient refractory medical treatment tolerate treatment . Recent pilot study suggest occipital nerve stimulation ( ONS ) medically intractable CCH ( MICCH ) might offer effective alternative medical treatment . There randomised clinical trial placebo effect exclude . Long term tolerability know indication . Here investigator propose prospective , randomise , double blind , parallel group multi-centre international clinical study compare reduction attack frequency baseline occipital nerve stimulation ( ONS ) patient MICCH two different stimulation condition : high ( 100 % ) low ( 30 % ) stimulation . Following implantation first run-in phase 10 day 10 % stimulation intensity , follow stepwise monthly increase either 30 % 100 % . Patients assess monthly blind assessor . The primary outcome measure mean number attack last 4 week double blind 6 month treatment period 100 % versus 30 % treatment group . Hereafter , open extension phase 6 month , patient receive 100 % stimulation stimulation consider optimal patient . Secondary outcome measure include rate responder ( â‰¥ 50 % reduction attack frequency last 4 week treatment period ) , patient 's satisfaction , medication use , quality life , mean pain intensity , economic evaluation whether patient would recommend treatment another patient . The investigator also investigate whether predictive factor identify efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Occipital Nerve Stimulation Medically Intractable Chronic Cluster Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia ( TACs ) characterize frequent , short-lasting attack unilateral extremely severe headache accompany ipsilateral facial autonomic feature severe primary headache disorder . TACs include cluster headache ( CH ) , paroxysmal hemicrania ( PH ) short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache conjunctival injection tearing ( SUNCT ) . CH common form TAC . The 1-year prevalence 1 1000 , vast majority patient episodic CH ( ECH ) : period week month frequent attack alternate symptom-free period several month year . About 10 % chronic CH ( CCH ) : attack free period less one month every 12 month , unless treatment give . The chronic form primary unremitting onset , secondary , transform episodic form . CCH may spontaneously become episodic . Effective acute treatment CH attack injectable intranasal triptans oxygen inhalation . Steroids ( short period ) , verapamil , lithium carbonate methysergide effective preventive therapy . At least 10 % patient CCH may become refractory tolerate medical therapy . For patient medically intractable CCH ( MICCH ) common treatment . Different experimental treatment , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , radiofrequency lesion , glycerol injection , gamma knife , surgery root section trigeminal nerve either substantially ineffective , significant short-comings serious complication death neurological deficit anaesthesia dolorosa lack efficacy . CH considerable impact socio-economic personal function due direct cost healthcare service indirect cost lose work day decrease work efficacy . Higher pain score high percentage patient poor health due pain social functioning find among CH patient compare patient suffer migraine . The impact social function , quality life use healthcare patient MICCH likely even large , although precise figure available . In study Burns et al . patient , suffer MICCH , average four attack per day . Attacks CH describe patient bad child birth . Recently treatment headache list one top priority US National Institute Medicine 's agenda comparative-effectiveness research . Functional image study CH identify activation region posterior hypothalamus , lead use neurostimulation therapy MICCH . Hypothalamic DBS show effective patient MICCH unfortunately treatment associate high risk ( even lethal ) consequence . Structures occipital region head mainly innervate great occipital nerve branch C2 spinal root . Convergence cervical , somatic trigeminal dural trigeminovascular afferent second order nociceptors brain stem well document . Stimulation great occipital nerve increase metabolic activity cervical region spinal cord trigeminal nucleus caudalis cat . In human occipital nerve blockade decrease ipsi- contralateral R2 response , confirm anatomic functional convergence afferent cervical trigeminal pathway . These study suggest modulation pathway may influence headache . Suboccipital injection corticosteroid local anaesthetic show effective placebo-controlled trial . In study 4 patient suffer CCH include . In patient attack recur eventually . The author suggest suboccipital steroid injection ought try single shot treatment invasive treatment consider DBS , later study turn predictive value response neuromodulation therapy . Along line , stimulation great occipital nerve ( ONS ) try success intractable headache include CCH . Burns et al . describe 14 patient suffer MICCH treat ONS open retrospective study . Ten patient improve ; three improve 90 % , 3 40 % -90 % 4 20-30 % . In prospective open ONS study MICCH patient Magis et al . show reduction attack frequency 79.9 % . No serious complication describe study .</detailed_description>
