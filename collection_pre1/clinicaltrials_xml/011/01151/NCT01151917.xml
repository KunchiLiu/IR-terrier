	<brief_summary>Glycemic control rapidly restore patient insulin resistance bariatric surgery , particular mal-absorptive one ( i.e . Bilio-pancreatic diversion , BPD ) . To evaluate mechanism allow restoration insulin sensitivity BPD investigator aim identify use proteomic approach plasma protein peptide may involve remarkably fast explicit restoration insulin sensitivity . In addition unbiased proteomics approach , selection recognize marker metabolic control measure . These effort aim increase understanding insulin sensitivity regulate may provide novel idea treat insulin resistance type 2-diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design The study design single-centre , observational study . The patient undergo routine analysis usually perform biliopancreatic diversion surgery ( BPD ) , independently participation specific protocol exception meal test . Twenty morbidly obese male subject schedule BPD include study . The inclusion exclusion criterion set create sufficiently homogenous study population . As outlined study flow chart subject study blood sample collect 3 week ( +/- 1 week ) 4 day ( +/- 1 day ) day BPD surgery ( baseline-1 baseline-2 ) , day surgery ( day 0 ) , every second day surgery first week ( immediate post surgery ) well two four week surgery ( post surgery-1 post surgery-2 ) . A deviation +/- 2 day allow post surgery-1 post surgery-2 visit . All fasting sample obtain morning overnight fast ( 12 h ) . Immediate post surgery ( fast ) sample collect 12 h rest parenteral nutrition arm use nutritional substitution first 4 day surgery ( parenteral nutrition give ) . The immediate post surgery ( fast ) sample obtain day 5 forward surgery , subject start eat , obtain morning overnight fast ( 12 h ) . Nutrient stimulation sample obtain baseline-1 2 post surgery-1 2 intake test meal . A complete list procedure visit provide Table 1 overview plan blood sample , include volume purpose provide Table 2 . Motivations collection various sample provide section 10.3.1 `` Proteomics analysis , experimental design issue '' . In case discontinuation , additional subject enrol complete set sample less 20 subject obtain . Target subject population Inclusion criterion - Morbidly obese male BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 , obesity disease , eligible bariatric surgery accept undergo BPD - Confirmed insulin resistance ; fast serum insulin level &gt; 60 pmol/L - Age 25-55 year - Weight stable least 6 month study ( +/- 5 kg within previous 6 month ) - Stable medication - Provision informed consent , statistical analysis , publication obtain result Exclusion criterion - Patients eligible BPD - Incapacity give valid informed consent unwilling give consent - Patients eligible BPD , : - Type 2-diabetes mellitus - Significant illness within two week precede surgery , judge physician . - Obvious infection ( bacteria , virus etc ) - Major cardiovascular disease - Major gastrointestinal , respiratory , hormonal disorder - Medication affect lipid metabolism within 3 month study - History drug addiction and/or alcohol use - Suspected confirmed poor compliance - Exercise +/-3 time week - Blood donation within 12 week precede screen visit</detailed_description>
