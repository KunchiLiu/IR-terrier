	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) condition lung result breathe difficulty due lung become inflamed airway narrow . Current treatment focus open narrow airway , addition , know increase inflammation blood patient increase risk heart disease . Statins , simvastatin one , drug use low cholesterol blood may also reduce inflammation low risk heart disease . This study explore whether simvastatin reduce one risk factor patient COPD short term proof principle study . The key purpose determine whether simvastatin improves pressure stiffness main blood vessel namely arterial stiffness measure aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) . In parallel , describe change airways / blood inflammation change breathe ability</brief_summary>
