	<detailed_description>The significant morbidity mortality associate acute kidney injury critical care patient cardiac surgery well-known . Studies demonstrate 1 30 % postoperative mortality , even high rate 70 % patient develop kidney failure require dialysis . Even small increase creatinine 0 0.5 mg/dl result great two-fold rise 30-day mortality . Despite effort improve outcome , proven effective pharmacological intervention treat acute kidney failure . Most recommendation aim prevention identify high-risk patient , avoid nephrotoxic drug minimize intraoperative hypotensive insult . There study assess renal blood flow use transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) . Yang et al . examine leave renal artery 60 patient use TEE cardiac surgery evaluate feasibility use TEE method measure renal blood flow intraoperatively . Although able include 60 % subject due technical difficulty , demonstrate le 10 % variability measurement therefore good reproducibility use TEE . Renal blood flow may best method predict sufficient renal perfusion . Renal autoregulation preserve general anesthesia even maintenance adequate mean arterial blood pressure cardiac output . Renal blood flow worsen hemodilution hypothermia . In addition , due pulsatile nature , diameter renal artery vary cardiac cycle source calculation error determine renal blood flow function renal blood velocity arterial diameter . Renal resistive index ( RI ) measure intrarenal hemodynamics calculate use blood flow velocity segmental intrarenal vessel correlate renal blood flow renovascular resistance . The renal artery use flow varies inconsistent systole diastole . RI becomes elevate pathological condition associate increase creatinine , renal injury dysfunction . As blood flow creatinine clearance decrease renal vasculature , resistive index increase . Resistive index may better gauge renal dysfunction rather renal blood flow easy ass less dependent obtain Doppler beam view orient perfectly parallel blood flow . Because RI ratio renal blood flow velocity [ RI = ( peak systolic velocity - peak end diastolic velocity ) /peak systolic velocity ] , margin error create non-parallel Doppler beam cancel . Traditionally , resistive index obtain transabdominal Doppler ultrasonography ( USG ) although transesophageal study use RI secondary endpoint examine renal blood flow . There currently technique routinely uses TEE intraoperatively monitor resistive index determination adequate renal blood perfusion indication renal compromise .</detailed_description>
