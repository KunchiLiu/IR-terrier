	<brief_title>Oxidative Stress Markers Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) common diagnosis significant clinical impact . Although medical therapy exists , many patient optimal medical treatment still highly symptomatic . About 1/3 patient condition know `` dyssynchrony '' , wall heart beat uncoordinated way , cause worsen CHF symptom . A new therapy know cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) successful decreasing symptom dyssynchronous patient . It involve surgical placement pacemaker contain 3 wires- one top part heart ( atrium ) coordinate top bottom part heart beat , two bottom coordinate bottom part heart beat ( ventricle ) . This treatment , however , work 1/3 patient dyssynchrony . Recent study find CHF associate increase oxidative stress . This condition abnormal oxygen form produce . These form harm cell heart , cause beat abnormally cause damage heart muscle . We would like see level form improve CRT , measure early surgery predict benefit surgery . In study , compare blood marker oxidative stress patient CHF already-collected set control patient confirm level elevate baseline . Then , perform CRT surgery implant pacemaker CHF patient . At 1 week 3 month postoperatively , measure blood marker , see improved patient whose symptom improve . Patients undergo echocardiograms document abnormal heart , 6 minute hall walk measure exercise tolerance , take standardize questionnaire measure symptom CHF . These test result compare pre post CRT ass response therapy .</detailed_description>
