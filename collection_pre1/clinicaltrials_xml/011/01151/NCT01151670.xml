	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Hydrochloride Preventing Radiation-Induced Cognitive Dysfunction Treating Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To evaluate tolerability toxicity associate two different dose regimen pioglitazone administer orally cytoprotective agent radiation-induced brain injury . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To evaluate effect pioglitazone glycemic level hemoglobin A1c value pioglitazone use cytoprotective agent concurrent radiotherapy normoglycemic patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fractionate external beam radiotherapy , 3-D conformal radiotherapy , intensity-modulated radiotherapy . Patients receive oral pioglitazone hydrochloride daily 1 week prior brain irradiation , continue 6 month completion radiation radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
