	<brief_summary>This pilot project evaluate Internet-based remote access electronic clinical system support study monitoring task . The project engage two NIH-sponsored clinical trial network ( adult : ARDS network ; pediatrics : ChiLDREN network ) five trial location two coordinate center locate across four state , engages three collaborate NCRR-funded CTSA institution . Each study location use different electronic clinical system remote access method , replicate diversity clinical application access method find across large research network . The result pilot project inform broader project engage trial site electronic clinical system national network . This proposal extend Specific Aim 1.2 Research Informatics Integrated Core ( RIIC ) parent grant ( UL1 RR025780 ) Colorado Clinical Translational Sciences Institute ( CCTSI ) : `` The RIIC develop implement tool service willâ€¦ . ( 2 ) support efficient execution CCTSI translational research project . '' ( CCTSI grant page 1053 ) . Specific Aim 1.2 proposes develop new informatics method increase translational research capacity improve efficiency execute clinical study . Reducing barrier study monitor via remote access enable new innovative approach protect study subject , ensure study data quality document regulatory compliance . An example completely new model study monitoring could continuous study monitor coordinate center study location Internet-connected world . We hypothesize remote monitoring demonstrate substantial improvement study monitor efficiency , effectiveness , possibly overall cost compare present monitoring plan require prolonged on-site visit study monitor coordinate center . We claim remote study monitor replace monitoring task . But , monitor task require access electronic clinical data , seek demonstrate remote access enable frequent SDV regulatory documentation compliance , turn could facilitate new model continuous study monitoring . The result study would support improvement study monitor would significantly reduce cost conduct large multi-center clinical improve safety patient enrol trial</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>II . Research Project Plan Specific Aim 1 : To determine effectiveness remote access electronic clinical system clinical trial study monitoring . Accuracy completeness source document verification ( SDV ) compliance regulatory documentation requirement effectiveness outcome measure . Specific Aim 2 : To determine efficiency remote access electronic clinical system clinical trial study monitoring . The time complete SDV regulatory review without remote access prior on-site visit efficiency outcome measure . Specific Aim 3 : To determine data monitor site cost study data verification regulatory documentation compliance without remote access prior on-site visit . Research Methods Design The specific aim focus evaluate effectiveness ( Aim 1 ) , efficiency ( Aim 2 ) , cost ( Aim 3 ) remote study monitoring compare on-site SDV . The study design three Specific Aims identical . The analysis variable analytic plan vary Specific Aim . There five phase project : ( 1 ) IT development , ( 2 ) local pre-pilot , ( 3 ) remote monitoring , ( 4 ) on-site monitoring , ( 5 ) study analysis . Study Phase 1 : Initial IT development test Five study site provide remote access exist clinical system use commercial self-developed access method . Phase 1 ensure access method configure provide appropriate security audit capability . The University Colorado Hospital ( UCH ) identify need integrate McKesson CareManager clinical documentation system MedXplore remote access system . The budget provide programming resource support integration development Year 1 . Should technical limitation arise location , Phase 1 use alter extend exist access method meet institutional requirement . Contingency plan include use remote desktop sharing , propose Vanderbilt , export local application screen remote desktop securely . This contingency ensure remote monitor experience identical application screen see on-site visit . Study Phase 2 : Pre-pilot test remote monitoring use local study coordinator Study coordinator , local five study sit clinical research access privilege already establish respective hospital , perform remote study monitor review one study subject fully test technical issue remote access require application execution feature data collection instrument . The local coordinator connect hospital system secure computer site hospital . The study coordinator conduct on-site chart review . The study coordinator collect study measure outline Table 2 . Procedures stop search data element , account work break , interruption , call additional help local site manager develop . Data collection instrument test alter need . The pre-pilot test simulate activity Phase 3 &amp; 4 operational issue resolve . Once complete , study procedure data collection instrument finalize use Phases 3 &amp; 4 . Study Phase 3 : Remote monitoring data coordinate center Randomization study subject two equal arm stratify individual hospital . Subjects assign Arm A remote monitoring perform 2-4 week prior schedule on-site visit . Subjects assign Arm B remote monitoring perform . Both arm traditional on-site study monitoring perform . Remote access provisioning perform IT five study location allow remote monitor access electronic record . Depending institutional responsibility , HIM IT resource provision remote account access subject randomize Arm A ( remote + local monitoring ) . Remote monitoring consist validate data element submit CRFs submit coordinate center require source document verification , use data verification protocol currently use on-site visit . Remote monitor telephone access HIM local coordinator resource available on-site . Rules stop search data element establish Phase 2 . Data collection instrument capture study variable develop pilot test Phase 2 . Remote monitor train access procedure site study data collection procedure develop Phase 2 use simultaneous remote desktop share study subject schedule monitoring . Study Phase 4 : On-site monitoring data coordinate center On-site monitoring occur 2-4 week follow remote monitoring . Subjects Study Arms source document verification . Only element verify remotely ( Step ( A ) ) verify subject Arm A Step ( B ) . The monitor perform remote local monitoring subject Arm A . The study variable develop Phase 2 use remote monitoring Phase 3 use on-site monitoring Phase 4 . Study Phase 5 : Data analysis Specific Aim 1 focus accuracy completeness remote monitor versus on-site monitoring . The study variables number variable verify number verify variable find discrepant . Specific Aim 2 focus efficiency , measure study time complete source document verification regulatory review . The number minute complete source document verification regulatory review capture compare . Specific Aim 3 focus cost , measure use time-in-motion method study coordinator monitor . Using time log , time required complete CRF aggregate SDV total . This include time estimate find chart , make copy , record data . If study investigator participates monitor activity , record time estimate separately . Standardized estimate salary benefit person position use standardize across local regional wage price differential .</detailed_description>
