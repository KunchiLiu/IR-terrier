	<brief_title>Liposome Encapsulated Docetaxel ( LE-DT ) Patients With Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liposome Entrapped Doxetaxel ( LE-DT ) novel , proprietary delivery system docetaxel develop NeoPharm , Inc. Docetaxel ( currently market Taxotere® ) anti-microtubule agent prevents cell division promote assembly stabilization microtubule use treatment malignancy breast , prostate , lung , gastric , head neck . By remove toxic detergent use Taxotere® , LE-DT show reduced toxicity comparable therapeutic efficacy preclinical study . In clinic , believe LE-DT offer advantage patient few side effect similar dos , possibly great effectiveness use high dos . In addition , routine premedication prevent hypersensitivity may require . This study design determine follow : - The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) LE-DT . - The pharmacokinetics docetaxel follow intravenous administration LE-DT . - Any anti-tumor effect LE-DT . Up 5 dose level study .</detailed_description>
