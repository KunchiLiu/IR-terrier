	<brief_title>Peripheral Blood Biomarkers Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Broad Challenge Area address proposal ( 03 ) Biomarker Discovery Validation , Specific Challenge Topic 03-HL-101 ( Identify validate clinically relevant , quantifiable biomarkers diagnostic therapeutic response blood , vascular , cardiac , respiratory tract dysfunction ) . Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIP ) lung disease ( ) primarily affect elderly , present age group . IIP cause respiratory insufficiency often fatal . In half patient , diagnosis require invasive lung biopsy cause complication , always accurate . The current diagnostic tool IIP inadequate . In addition inaccurate diagnosis , costly , often result delayed diagnosis treatment . The challenge ( ) intend address proposal improve accurate early diagnosis idiopathic interstitial lung pneumonia ( IIP ) , improve ability differentiate subtypes idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( IIPs ) develop peripheral blood biomarkers .</detailed_description>
