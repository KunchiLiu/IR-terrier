	<criteria>Be le 18 39 year age . Sign Written Informed Consent investigator record Case Report Form ( See separate document ) . Be willing able adhere instruction set protocol . Own cell phone willing receive text message day . Be exist successful daily wear soft contact lens . For purpose study mean wear lens least 6 hour per day , 5 day per week last month . No extended wear last 3 month . Subjective refraction must result vertexed spherical contact lens prescription 1.00 6.00D . Have refractive astigmatism less equal 1.00D eye . Achieve visual acuity 6/9 ( 20/30 ) good eye . Require visual correction eye ( monofit monovision allow ) . Does require presbyopic correction ( i.e . Not use presbyopic correction measure add power less +1.00D ) . Have normal eye evidence abnormality disease . For purpose study normal eye define one : No amblyopia . No evidence lid abnormality infection ( include blepharitis/meibomitis ) . No conjunctival abnormality infection . No clinically significant slit lamp finding ( i.e . stromal edema , vascularization , infiltrate abnormal opacity ) . No active ocular disease . Requires concurrent ocular medication . Clinically significant ( Grade 3 4 ) corneal stromal haze , corneal vascularization , tarsal abnormality , bulbar hyperemia , limbal hyperemia , abnormality cornea would contraindicate contact lens wear . Clinically significant corneal staining ( Grade 3 one corneal region per eye ) . Requires presbyopic correction ( i.e . Not use presbyopic correction measure add power less +1.00D ) . Has refractive surgery . Has eye injury/surgery within 8 week immediately prior enrolment study . Abnormal lacrimal secretion . Preexisting ocular irritation would preclude contact lens fit . Keratoconus corneal irregularity . PMMA ( polymethyl methacrylate ) , hybrid RGP ( rigid gas permeable ) lens wear previous 8 week . Does require presbyopic correction ( i.e . Not use presbyopic correction measure add power less +1.00D ) . Any systemic illness would contraindicate lens wear medical treatment would affect vision successful lens wear . Diabetic . Infectious disease ( e.g. , hepatitis , tuberculosis ) immunosuppressive disease ( e.g. , HIV ( Human immunodeficiency virus ) ) . History chronic eye disease ( e.g . glaucoma ARMD ( age relate macular degeneration ) ) . Pregnancy , lactate plan pregnancy time enrolment . Participation concurrent clinical trial last 30 day .</criteria>
