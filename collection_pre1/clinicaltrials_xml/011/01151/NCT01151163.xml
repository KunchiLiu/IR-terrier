	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) characterize presence widespread pain , chronic fatigue typical sleep disturbance . The purpose current study investigate nature sleep disturbance FMS , use novel technology . Peripheral arterial tonometry method peripheral arterial tone measure non - invasively use ambulatory setup sleep . The information collect reflect autonomic nervous system function respiratory change sleep . We intend utilize technique order improve understanding interrupt pattern sleep FMS possible biomarker may use future follow FMS patient response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FMS ) clinical entity characterize presence chronic , widespread pain tenderness throughout musculoskeletal system . FMS consider prototype central pan syndrome , condition augmentation pain processing central nervous system major feature ( 1 ; 2 ) . As , FMS overlap number similar `` functional '' disorder , include TMJD , IBS , Interstitial cystitis , Gulf war syndrome , chronic fatigue syndrome etc ( 3-5 ) . A major clinical feature FMS presence chronic fatigue , typically accompany severely disrupted sleep pattern . Difficulty fall asleep , frequent awaken non-refreshing sleep feature classically report FMS patient . In addition , number classic sleep disturbance identify among FMS patient alpha - wave intrusion , disrupt normal stage IV sleep , well nocturnal fall oxygen saturation ( 6 ) . Notably , disturb sleep may contribute chronic fatigue , also enhance pain processing well depression FMS patient ( 7 ) . Thus , pain inhibitory function CNS , process Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control ( DNIC ) appear impaired sleep disruption ( 8 ) . Considerable interest focus role sleep apnea FMS , possible factor contribute fatigue pain . Overt obstructive sleep apnea diagnose patient ( 9 ) subtle disruption upper airway dynamic , increase upper airway pressure , lead total airway collapse , detect many patient ( 10 ) . Other researcher however challenge association FMS sleep apnea ( 11 ) . Autonomic dysfunction another important clinical manifestation FMS common symptom include presyncope / syncope , palpitation stand dizziness ( 12 ) . Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome ( POTS ) another autonomic disorder clinically overlap FMS ( 13 ) . Traditional polysomnography time-consuming costly procedure , hence , relatively FMS patient formally evaluate sleep disorder clinical practice . The Watch-PATTM100 non-invasive device , utilizes peripheral arterial tone ( PAT ) , reflect change autonomic nervous system function , marker identify document respiratory disturbance sleep . The PAT signal acquire non-invasive probe attach finger sleep . Parameters measure include oxygen saturation , heart rate , sleep wake state , REM non-REM sleep . The purpose current study use Peripheral Arterial Tonometry ( PAT ) order compare disturb sleep breathing autonomic dysfunction fibromyalgia patient healthy control .</detailed_description>
