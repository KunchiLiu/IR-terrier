	<brief_title>Calcium Phosphorus Balance Calcium Kinetics Patients With Stage 3/4 Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study gain good understand calcium absorption metabolism patient Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) . It important body get enough calcium support many important body function include bone health . CKD change calcium balance calcium absorb excrete . Because , knowledge calcium absorption excretion patient normal kidney function use assess patient CKD . In patient CKD bone heath often negatively affected due combination poor calcium absorption , increase bone turnover ( process old bone remove new bone form ) , increase level parathyroid hormone ( PTH [ hormone act increase calcium blood ] ) decrease vitamin D level . This negative effect refer Chronic Kidney Disease Mineral Bone Disorder ( CKD-MBD ) . Treatment correct CKD-MBD begin early course CKD . In normal population calcium supplement frequently use help prevent age relate bone loss . Calcium supplement also use CKD patient help bind phosphate . Maintaining correct level phosphate body crucial CKD . However , calcium supplement may adverse effect promote calcium phosphate deposit soft tissue like vascular system could increase risk cardiovascular disease . Therefore formal balance study need determine positive calcium balance occur patient advanced CKD give calcium meal phosphate binder . This study also evaluate body handle phosphate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients GFR &lt; 45 ml/min ; 2 . Intact serum PTH &gt; 37 pg/ml ; 3 . Age &gt; 35 year ( gender race ) ; 4 . Able perform two threeweek balance study ; 5 . Not oral calcium vitamin D multi vitamin , willing stop calcium vitamin D one month prior entry study ( day 1 first calcium balance period ) ; 6 . Female patient must postmenopausal ( define last menstrual period least 12 month prior screen visit ) surgically sterile hysterectomy ; 7 . On stable dos diuretic , bisphosphonates , antiepileptic ( except dilantin ) least 2 month . 1 . Serious underlie systemic disease ( include uncontrolled diabetes , lupus , hypertension , amyloid , etc ) ; 2 . Taking drug alter calcium phosphate balance homeostasis include high dose cholecalciferol ergocalciferol ( 1000 U/day 50,000U/ wk , respectively ) , active vitamin D metabolites , calcimimetics , PTH analogues last 30 day ; 3 . Taking drug investigator feel alter calcium balance ; 4 . Plan initiate dialysis next six month ; 5 . Hypercalcemia define serum calcium &gt; 10.5 mg/dl ; 6 . Hyperphosphatemia define serum phosphate &gt; 5.5mg/ml ; 7 . Intestinal disease alters absorption normal intestinal function include celiac disease , small bowel resection , bariatric surgery ; 8 .
