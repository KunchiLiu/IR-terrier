	<brief_summary>Rituximab attractive agent bring upfront treatment chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) due favorable toxicity profile , proven efficacy treatment steroid-refractory cGVHD , ability serve steroid sparing agent autoimmune disease . The investigator hope demonstrate Rituximab significant activity cGVHD utilize early course process . In addition , investigator hope show early use Rituximab may allow early discontinuation immunosuppression obviate need long course systemic corticosteroid , translate reduce treatment-related morbidity mortality associate cGVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) remain important curative therapy many patient hematological malignancy , treatment-related morbidity mortality continue major challenge . Chronic GVHD remain major complication follow allogeneic HSCT , half patient affect . Although cGVHD associate decrease relapse risk due well documented graft-versus-malignancy effect , also associate significant adverse consequence term morbidity , mortality , quality-of-life , treatment cost associate HSCT . Rituximab investigate small number patient refractory cGVHD use standard regimen 375 mg/m2/week 4 week . Ratanatharathorn et al . document sustained response four eight patient steroid-refractory cGVHD diffuse localize sclerodermatous manifestation . Similarly , Canninga-vanDijk et al . Okamoto et al . observed case clinical , laboratory histological improvement Rituximab treatment . Cutler et al . report result phase I-II study Rituximab 21 patient steroid-refractory cGVHD . Treatment well tolerate , toxicity limit infectious event , without hematological toxicity significant reduction circulate immunoglobulin document therapy . Objective response document 70 % patient ( include 10 % complete response ) primarily skin musculoskeletal involvement , allow tapering , case withdraw , previous immunosuppressant therapy . A correlation clinical response decrease titre antibody Y chromosome-encoded minor HLA antigens show . The result preliminary study highlight potential therapeutic activity Rituximab cGVHD manifestation particularly high efficacy skin involvement , include scleroderma . Recently , Zaja et al . confirm activity Rituximab refractory cGVHD large series 38 patient . Treatment generally well tolerate nearly 60 % 50 % patient clinical improvement skin mouth manifestation , respectively . The median time-to-response nearly 2 month case response durable . Responses also detectable patient eye , liver , lung , gut joint involvement , allow reduction and/or suspension previous baseline immunosuppressive therapy significant number patient</detailed_description>
