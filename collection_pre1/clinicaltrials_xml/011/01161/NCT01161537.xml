	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) cause mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . The encoded protein , CFTR , epithelial chloride ion channel responsible aid regulation salt water absorption secretion various tissue . Although disease affect multiple organ , lead cause mortality progressive loss lung function . Obstruction airways thick mucus , chronic bacterial infection airway , inflammatory response think play role cause lung damage . Through function chloride channel , CFTR believe integral epithelial ion water transport hence , maintain normal hydration lung secretion . VX-770 ( ivacaftor ) potent selective potentiator wild-type , G551D , F508del , R117H form human CFTR . Based vitro study pharmacologic , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , safety profile , VX-770 select clinical development possible treatment patient CF . Hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging ( HG-MRI ) promise new mean assess lung function direct image certain non-radioactive isotope inert noble gas , helium xenon . Through technique , high-resolution 3-dimensional image lung ventilation obtain pediatric adult patient single short breath-hold follow inhalation gas . This 2-part study evaluate effect VX-770 hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance imaging ( 3He-MRI ) , evaluate safety efficacy VX-770 subject age 12 year old CF G551D-CFTR mutation . Part A single-blind , placebo-controlled study include 4 week VX-770 treatment 4 week placebo treatment . Part B open-label , 48 week study long-term effect VX 770 hyperpolarized 3He-MRI .</brief_summary>
