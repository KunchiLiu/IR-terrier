	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial demonstrate long-term safety efficacy Inspire system . The Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation ( UAS ) therapy intend treat moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea improve airway patency stimulation hypoglossal nerve . Study objectives include demonstrate Inspire system improve key index sleep apnea pre-specified percentage patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The STAR trial multicenter , prospective trial include randomize controlled therapy withdrawal study . The primary secondary endpoint data collect in-laboratory sleep study 12 month device implant compare baseline sleep study . Following 12-month visit , 46 consecutive respond subject randomize 1:1 either therapy maintenance group ( ON group ) therapy withdrawal group ( OFF group ) . A subsequent sleep study two randomize group conduct result compare two group . In addition , quality life questionnaire administer baseline 12-month visit ass effectiveness Inspire therapy . The STAR trial conduct 15 clinical site United States 7 Europe . Of 126 implanted subject STAR trial , 87 69 % implant United States . The remain 39 subject 31 % implant Europe . The STAR trial subject evaluate prior implant ensure follow : 1 ) pre-implant AHI ( score in-laboratory sleep study prior implant ) 20 50 event per hour , 2 ) AHI contribution central mixed sleep apnea le 25 % , 3 ) subject primarily lateral OSA ( define limit sleep apnea lie side ) , 4 ) subject complete concentric collapse level soft palate observe drug-induced sleep endoscopy ( DISE ) . After successful pre-implant screening , subject implant Inspire system . The subject allow recover 1 month follow surgery , time second in-laboratory sleep study conduct without activate Inspire device . The result 1-month sleep study average result pre-implant sleep study , average define subject 's baseline . The Inspire device programmable order optimize subject 's response therapy . The initial device setting program office setting . Additional adjustment make overnight sleep study whereby real time review polysomnogram ( PSG ) available aid device set adjustment 2 6-month visit . At 12-month in-laboratory sleep study , device adjustment allow sleep study primary endpoint sleep study . Furthermore , device adjustment allow 13-month sleep study randomize control therapy withdrawal sleep study . Blinding possible study since stimulation therapy evoke physiological response subject . However , primary endpoint base objective measure AHI oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) collect overnight sleep study use PSG . The sleep study score independent core lab order minimize assessment bias . Furthermore , sleep study result , well clinical result , 100 % source data verify Inspire clinical monitoring team .</detailed_description>
