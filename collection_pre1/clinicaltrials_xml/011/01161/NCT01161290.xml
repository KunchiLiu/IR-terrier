	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS : The study purpose evaluate effectiveness structure pursed-lips breathing ( PLB ) protocol taught via real-time interactive telecommunication home computer use lnternet Skype software veteran chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD . The primary hypothesis veteran COPD dyspnea exertion receive PLB educational intervention teach via weekly interactive telecommunication 4-week period great reduction exertional dyspnea compare receive PLB educational intervention weekly interactive session . RESEARCH PLAN : An experimental two- group design use . All subject receive brief 5 - 10 minute one-on-one PLB educational session . Subjects randomize either intervention group control group . The intervention group receive 4 weekly interactive group sessions health educator ( principal investigator ) via computer . A free software program know Skype allow synchronous video audio interaction . The comparison group receive brief PLB educational session weekly follow-up . RESULTS : At end 4 week , intervention group significantly low dyspnea intensity score ( group X time interaction F = 6.69 , p = 0.02 ) significantly high social support score ( group x time interaction F = 4.34 , p = 0.058 ) . CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE : Skype viable mean provide patient education . A structured PLB protocol provide significant difference exertional dyspnea time . A structured PLB protocol plus Skype show significant reduction patient ' sense dyspnea intensity increase social support score .</brief_summary>
