	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Efficacy Safety Lapatinib + Vinorelbine ErbB2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective phase II study gain first information efficacy ( PFS , ORR OS ) safety lapatinib plus vinorelbine patient HER2 positive breast cancer pretreated combination therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy ) include lapatinib metastatic disease . The sample size base statistical consideration . Thirty 30 patient consider appropriate phase II study gain first information efficacy safety study treatment study indication . Only descriptive statistical method use summarize study result . Kaplan-Meier estimate calculate PFS OS . Median PFS OS time correspond two side 95 % confidence interval provide . Categorical endpoint summarize frequency table 95 % confidence interval calculate objective response rate ( ORR ) use RECIST . All safety variable summarize descriptively The incidence adverse event summarize MedDRA term descriptive manner . The progression free survival time ( PFS ) primary efficacy endpoint study . Secondary outcome overall survival ( OS ) objective response rate ( ORR ) use RECIST . Safety outcomes adverse event , safety laboratory data , physical examination , vital sign , LVEF , ECG data ECOG performance status Definitions : The objective response rate rate subject complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) . Progression-free survival : The time progression death define time study entry first observation disease progression death due cause ( whichever occur earlier ) . Only death consider , occur within 84 day last tumor assessment study entry ( whichever later ) . If patient progression clinical cut-off death date beyond above-mentioned time interval last tumor assessment , time progression/death censor date last tumor assessment study entry ( case post-baseline tumor assessment ) . Overall survival calculate study entry death . For patient lose follow-up , data censor time patient last determined alive . As efficacy data vinorelbine plus lapatinib available far current protocol apply 2nd 3rd line therapy metastatic disease ORR 30-40 % median PFS 4-6 month expect .</detailed_description>
