	<brief_title>Early Surgery Versus Conventional Treatment Very Severe Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management asymptomatic patient severe aortic stenosis ( AS ) remain controversial , combined risk aortic valve surgery late complication aortic valve prosthesis need balance possibility prevent sudden death lower cardiac mortality . Considering sudden cardiac death occurs rate approximately 1 % per year average postoperative mortality isolate AV replacement 3.0-4.0 % , 2007 European Society Cardiology guideline recommend aortic valve surgery asymptomatic patient severe AS 2006 American College Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommend surgery class IIb indication patient extremely severe AS low operative risk . Clinical outcome vary widely accord severity stenosis asymptomatic AS , asymptomatic patient severe AS often refer aortic valve replacement clinical practice despite lack data support early surgery . Rosenhek et al recently report bad prognosis high event rate risk rapid deterioration severe AS , investigator also recently report compare conventional treatment strategy , early surgery patient severe AS associated improve long-term survival prospective , observational study . However , prospective , randomized study compare early surgery watchful wait strategy severe AS . We seek compare long-term clinical outcome early surgery conventional management base current guideline .</detailed_description>

According revised 2014 AHA/ACC Valvular Heart Disease Guideline recommend exercise test confirm absence symptom asymptomatic patient severe AS ( Class IIa ) , eligible patient positive exercise test exclude entry May , 2014 .
