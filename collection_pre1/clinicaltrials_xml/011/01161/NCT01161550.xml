	<brief_summary>This study evaluate investigational drug Midostaurin various dos give ATRA CLAG chemotherapy . Midostaurin FLT3 inhibitor activate overexpressed significant proportion AML patient . Research show midostaurin drug like midostaurin may work good combination chemotherapy , like CLAG . CLAG combination cladribine , cytarabine , G-CSF approve FDA use treat AML .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main purpose study gather information use drug call midostaurin give ATRA CLAG chemotherapy . Midostaurin investigational drug . It drug inhibit FLT3 mutate overexpressed significant proportion AML patient . Research show midostaurin drug like midostaurin may work good combination chemotherapy , like CLAG . ATRA known promote myeloid differentiation also show augment cancer cell death combination chemotherapy . CLAG combination cladribine , cytarabine , G-CSF approve FDA use treat AML . This study look safe combination , tolerate treatment , see dose midostaurin appropriate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must ≥18 age . Because dose adverse event data currently available use midostaurin combination ATRA CLAG patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric phase 2 combination trial . Patient must diagnose refractory relapse AML . For purpose study , refractory AML define failure achieve CR 2 cycle induction chemotherapy persistent &gt; 40 % bone marrow blast one cycle chemotherapy induction . Relapsed AML define evidence disease recurrence achieve CR . Early relapse define relapse occur early 12 month late relapse define relapse occur later 12 month . Patient must Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70 % ( unless poor performance status related disease ) . Patient must follow laboratory value : AST ALT ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) , Serum Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN , Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Laboratory value outside range secondary AML disease . Patient must able understand willing sign write informed consent document prior registration study . Patient must newly diagnose AML . Patient must acute promyelocytic leukemia Patient must know CNS leukemia Patient must history allergic reaction compound similar chemical biologic composition midostaurin agent use study . Patient must uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction within 6 month , poorly control hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes , chronic renal disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patient must condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place him/her unacceptable risk s/he participate study confound ability interpret data study . Patient may concurrently use anticancer agent treatment ( exception hydroxyurea , steroid , leukopheresis ) . Female patient must pregnant breastfeeding . Adults reproductive potential must employ effective method birth control . Barrier contraceptives must use throughout study sex . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test 48 hour prior administration midostaurin . Women consider childbearing potential include follow : menses least 5 year ; menses within 5 year amenorrheic least 2 month luteinizing hormone ( LH ) follicular stimulate hormone ( FSH ) value within normal range ( accord definition postmenopausal laboratory use ) ; bilateral oophorectomy amenorrheic least 3 month . Patient must impair cardiac function include follow : Screening ECG QTc &gt; 450 msec Patients congenital long QT syndrome History presence sustain ventricular tachycardia Any history ventricular fibrillation torsades de pointes Bradycardia define HR &lt; 50 bpm Right bundle branch block + leave anterior hemiblock ( bifascicular block ) Patients myocardial infarction unstable angina &lt; 6 month prior start study drug CHF NY Heart Association class III IV Patients ejection fraction &lt; 50 % assessed MUGA ECHO scan within 14 day Day 1 . Patients must know confirmed diagnosis HIV infection active viral hepatitis . Patient may receive investigational agent within 30 day prior Day 1 . Patient may receive investigational agent trial . Patients must surgical procedure , exclude central venous catheter placement minor procedure ( e.g . skin biopsy ) within 14 day Day 1 . Patients must pulmonary infiltrate , include suspect infectious origin . In particular , patient resolution clinical symptom pulmonary infection residual pulmonary infiltrates chest xray eligible pulmonary infiltrates completely resolve .</criteria>
