	<brief_summary>Laparotomy perform emergency elective surgery may complicate intrabdominal collection , anastomotic leakage , infarction others . This condition able induce peritoneal inflammation . Inflamed peritoneum able produce excess lactate investigator measure collect fluid peritoneal drainage . Drainage leave abdomen monitor intrabdominal condition passage stool flatus . Minimum drainage serum present daily also uncomplicated post operative period . Serum lactate relates increase systemic anaerobic metabolism SIRS , sepsis systemic hypoperfusion easy measure blood gas analysis . The investigator hypothesize increase peritoneal/ serum lactate ratio could earlier , sensible , non-invasive , economical marker post surgical complication . The decision whether perform relaparotomy secondary peritonitis largely subjective base professional experience . Actually exist score system aid decision . The aim study demonstrate ratio could useful tool surgeon decisional process .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post operative intraabdominal sepsis due surgical complication associate important mortality morbidity . Early diagnosis crucial improve outcome . Relaparotomy could necessary eradicate intraabdominal focus sepsis hypoperfusion . The relaparotomy must perform early diagnosis surgical complication onset multi organ failure . This prospective observational study include post operative period consecutive patient require major elective surgery urgent laparotomy . Demographic data , presence nature underlie disease surgical diagnosis record admission study inclusion . Daily study inclusion , investigator measure : venous blood gas , blood lactate lactate present fluid collect abdomen . Possum SAPSII score calculate daily patient develop rapid clinical deterioration . The investigator follow patient complicate uncomplicated post operative period . Post operative complication define : mesenteric ischemia , need reintervention , anastomotic leakage fistula , secondary peritonitis death . The primary end point demonstrate correlation surgical complication serum/abdominal lactate ratio . The second end point verify correlation need relaparotomy Possum SAPSII score .</detailed_description>
