	<brief_summary>This project examine current diagnosis treatment bone health patient obstructive airway disease . Patients refer The Osteoporosis Centre BC ( OCBC ) respirologist assess osteoporosis include Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan . Previous chest xrays access examined vertebral fracture , diagnostic osteoporosis . The lung bone data enter database . This allow u explore relationship lung disease parameter osteoporosis predictor , eventually determine respirology patient population high risk fracture . Longitudinal evaluation bone health relationship respiratory parameter time explore follow-up evaluation 12 24 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Method : 1 . Selected respirologists ' practice identify patient risk osteoporosis ( accord Osteoporosis Canada Guidelines ) : 1. Who bone density test past 2 year 2. Who already take osteoporosis pharmacotherapy . 3 . Other patient meet criterion also refer discretion physician 2 . Patients give choice whether wish refer Osteoporosis Centre BC ( Vancouver ) expedite simple referral system OR may information send referring/family doctor discuss need referral evaluation bone health follow . Informed consent obtain Ethics Committee approve Informed Consent Form . Informed consent obtain patient follow research team . The consent allow researcher use clinical data image observational research ; participation research optional affect patient ability obtain information bone health OCBC . ii . A standard , full evaluation undertaken single visit ( DXA bone densitometry , consultation endocrinologist geriatrician ) . Screening secondary cause osteoporosis include Vitamin D status blood test occur community laboratory . All information obtain test review physician clinical treatment decision make base standard practice . iii . Densitometry OCBC research-calibrated DXA permit meaningful clinical follow-up . Respirologists ' office process : 1 . Men woman age 65 obstructive airway disease would ask bone density test past 2 year currently take osteoporosis therapy ( alendronate , risedronate , zoledronate , etidronate , , raloxifene , calcitonin , estrogen ) 2 If answer , respirologists would Explain standard care patient risk osteoporosis 1 . Recommend refer physician osteoporosis evaluation conduct ( non-study ) 2 . Ask patient would interest take part observational study . If patient wish participate consent form would give subject patient would ask permission research coordinator call 2-3 day discus study . The respirologist would generate expedited referral Osteoporosis Centre BC ( candidate observational study ) . The research coordinator would contact subject telephone script call speak subject answer question pertain study . During call research coordinator would determine whether subject would like meet prior appointment inform consent could obtain . Informed consent would obtain OCBC prior patient 's appointment . If patient wish consent study refer clinically , meet study coordinator , still able access usual clinical service provide OCBC . . A simple one-page referral faxed Osteoporosis Centre BC ii . All arrangement make either respirologists ' office directly patient OCBC iii . Consultation report send back refer doctor ( respirology ) family doctor Data osteoporosis clinical history , fracture history , medication history , chemistry , DXA collect data respiratory function . A database would make later analysis correlation . Chest Xray film take last 2 year would review . Chest CT image evaluated vertebral compression fracture ( potent risk factor future fragility fracture ) . Statistical Analysis : This study observational descriptive data produce . Regressions continuous variable analyze use Pearson correlation coefficient parametric variable analyze Chi Squared testing .</detailed_description>
