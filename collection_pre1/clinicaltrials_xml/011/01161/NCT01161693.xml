	<brief_summary>This study randomly allocate 180 woman undergo elective C-sections combine spinal epidural ( CSE ) Anesthesia BC Women 's Hospital one three group : Standard Pillow Head ( Control ) , Head Elevated Ramped Position immediately regional anesthesia ( HERP ) , Head Elevated Ramped Position horizontally- Horizontal establishment anesthesia head elevate surgical procedure ( HERP-H ) . The subject monitor blood pressure change ( hypotension ) , comfort level time adequate level anesthetic block obtain CSE . The study determine position parturient ramp position use elevation pillow significantly increase time anesthesia reach dermatome level T4 well whether increase maternal comfort provide good airway position parturient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Head Elevated Ramped Position During Elective Cesarean Delivery After Combined Spinal Epidural ( CSE ) Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority elective emergency cesarean delivery do neuraxial anesthesia ( spinal , epidural , combine spinal epidural ) nerve low half body anesthetise local anesthetic inject spine anesthesiologist . The injection do low level spine local anesthetic rise within cerebrospinal fluid `` block '' `` freeze '' high nerve . The maximum level sensory block anesthesia determine cephalad distribution local anesthetic CSF , total dose administer uptake neuronal tissue . The height block important ensure woman comfortable cesarean delivery ; generally loss cold sensation ice dermatome level T4 ( level nipple ) consider appropriate commence surgery . If block level T4 , woman likely feel discomfort potentially pain , whereas high level result hemodynamic instability difficulty breathe . Conventionally patient position operate table surgery flat horizontal ( supine ) position pillow head wedge position right hip prevent aortocaval compression . Many woman find lie completely flat awake uncomfortable uncommon request head bed elevated comfort . Difficult fail intubation obstetrics responsible number maternal death year . The incidence fail intubation approximately 1 280 obstetric population compare 1 2230 general surgical population . This result number factor , include increase airway swell due progesterone . However , much perceive difficulty due anatomical factor increase breast size obstruct lever hand try insert laryngoscope anesthetise patient 's mouth . There numerous report similar problem intubate airway bariatric ( obese ) parturients recently myth obesity cause difficult airway debunk provide patient position properly . Correct position patient `` ramp '' position patient head clearly elevated shoulder improve laryngeal exposure obese patient . Collins et al . show `` ramp '' patient horizontal alignment external auditory meatus sternal notch improve laryngeal view compare standard `` sniff '' position . Other benefit `` ramp '' position include good pre-oxygenation bag mask ventilation 25 degree head position supine position severely obese patient . Studies term parturients show increase functional residual capacity ( FRC ) slow desaturation rate head position compare supine position . Some parturients require general anesthesia endotracheal intubation caesarean delivery . This may due urgency situation , failure neuraxial anesthesia due prolong , difficult surgery . Having woman adequately position possible induction general anesthesia , even though neuraxial technique , would ideal perhaps safer . The ramped position achieve number way include folded blanket stack patient 's body , neck head . Most operating table manipulate use electronic manual control back/trunk position . Commercial device design include TROOPÂ® elevation pillow , design American bariatric anesthesiologist Dr Craig Troop . It plastic cover foam pillow elevation angle 20 degree simply place operating table . For purpose standardization use TROOP pillow mean achieve head elevation . Taking factor consideration would seem sensible head elevate parturient position operate table . However , majority obstetric surgery do neuraxial anesthesia 1 % undergoing general anesthesia elective situation 3 % emergency situation , concern position may result slow rise anesthetic block thereby delay start surgery . The factor affect level anesthetic block variable ; gravity may play part action raise head parturient might logically result slow rise anesthetic block result inadequate level surgery , particularly commonly use hyperbaric local anesthetic . However , large variability patient factor include dural sac compression epidural venous plexus engorgement secondary degree venal caval compression supine wedge position may push local anesthetic cephalad direction , may play significant role simple gravity . The effect ramp position level spinal anesthesia study . Much work look effect lateral versus sit posture insertion spinal anesthetic rise block hemodynamic stability . These study show slow onset anesthesia sit group versus lateral conflict result reduction hypotension . The slow rise may beneficial prevent hemodynamic instability . Mardirosoff et al. , look effect sensory block extension CSE non obstetric patient , show significant change block level patient sit 5 minute follow subarachnoid anesthesia ; mean level block group T4 . As strong evidence either support oppose rise block gravity , CSE anesthetic spinal block rise sufficient level group able supplement block local anesthetic inject epidural space help raise block epidural volume expansion and/or local anesthesia spinal nerve epidural space .</detailed_description>
