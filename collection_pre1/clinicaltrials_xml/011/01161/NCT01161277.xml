	<detailed_description>The advent neuroimaging open new window human brain . Here , propose investigate activation signature traditional antipsychotic agent dissociable new drug unique pharmacological profile differs typical recent atypical antipsychotic . The introduction aripiprazole interest clinically feature atypical antipsychotic ( antipsychotic effect low motor side effect ) differs antipsychotics partial D2 receptor agonist . Antipsychotic drug classify either typical atypical . Typical antipsychotic , like haloperidol , dopamine antagonist clinically efficacious occupy 60-70 % striatal dopamine D2 receptor , extra pyramidal side ( EPS ) effect begin show D2 receptor occupancy ( D2RO ) &gt; 80 % . Atypicals , like typicals , efficacious ; however , unique insofar low affinity dopamine receptor , target neurotransmitter system ( particular serotonergic system ) , show low motor side effect . While atypicals dopamine antagonist , new class antipsychotic characterize partial agonist emerge . Aripiprazole one novel partial agonist . It ability act antagonist presence high concentration dopamine agonist low concentration . Animal model use predict clinical efficacy antipsychotic well predict propensity induce EPS . What follow comparison behavior typical antagonist haloperidol novel partial antagonist aripiprazole model . Both haloperidol aripiprazole show dose-dependent striatal D2 receptor occupancy ( D2RO ) ( Natesan et al. , 2006 ) . In two measure clinical efficacy , condition avoidance response ( CAR ) amphetamine induce locomotion ( AIL ) , haloperidol aripiprazole behave differently . Haloperidol 's ED50 inhibition CAR AIL correspond ~60 % D2RO . Aripiprazole , however , show dissociation function occupancy . While aripiprazole similar haloperidol block AIL ~60 % D2RO , differ 23-fold high dose , correspond 86 % D2RO require inhibit CAR . It suggest Natesan et al. , 2006 functional dissociation occur result aripiprazole 's partial agonist property . If aripiprazole approximately 20 % vivo intrinsic activity , could raise threshold CAR inhibition ~60 % D2RO see haloperidol ~85 % D2RO see aripiprazole . A similar result CAR model find another measure clinical efficacy - FOS expression shell nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) . While haloperidol induce FOS dose correspond ~60 % D2RO , ~80 % D2RO need aripiprazole . Despite &gt; 80 % D2RO require aripiprazole efficacious CAR model , induce FOS NAcc shell , catalepsy present . This contrary see typicals , include haloperidol . It also surprising , aripiprazole D2ROs &gt; 80 % induce FOS core NAcc dorsolateral striatum ( marker catalepsy extrapyramidal symptom ) . It well establish animal treat low dos antipsychotic drug fail acquire perform avoidance response condition stimulus ( CS ) associate aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ) , whereas escape response stimulus affected aversive avoidance paradigm . This selective disruption avoidance , escape response , characteristic pharmacologic effect antipsychotic , include new atypical one . This feature effectively use differentiate antipsychotic medication class psychotropic drug predict clinical potency identify potential drug use antipsychotic . More appetitive paradigm animal work reward stimulus ( food , water , sex , brain stimulation ) show dramatic decrement performance/pursuit administer antipsychotic . This deficit reverse dopamine agonist amphetamine thus suggest symmetrical effect dopamine agonist antagonists kind paradigm . While typical antipsychotic like haloperidol reduce impact appetitive aversive CSs US dose produce &gt; 60 % D2 occupancy , report aripiprazole effective dos give rise occupancy &gt; 85 % . This examined human functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) might tool specific sensitive enough . fMRI standard tool human brain imaging provide good spatial resolution millimeter level second level temporal resolution . Event-related fMRI , wherein brain response record response specific event , optimally suit study neurobiology phenomenon classical conditioning human . In previous event-related fMRI study group , use Pavlovian aversive conditioning , ventral striatum reliably directly activate three experiment . These result replicate healthy control , whereas patient schizophrenia show different activation pattern . The ventral striatum activate anticipation aversive event regardless whether opportunity avoid aversive stimulus ( similar animal model describe ) . Thus , data suggest ventral striatum , crucial element dopaminergic mesolimbic `` reward '' system , directly activate anticipation aversive stimulus . Similar conditioning study also find robust activation anterior insula anterior cingulate , part great limbic cortex project ventral striatum . The anterior insula propose play role process emotional relevant context disgust pain whereas anterior cingulate involve assess motivational content internal external stimulus regulate context dependent behavior . Both structure extensive connection amygdala substrate commonly associate fear . The field pharmacological fMRI emerge early study demonstrate proof principle drug influence activation . The dopamine system focus several fMRI study , probably result innervation key cortical sub-cortical region implicate motor neurocognitive function , addition implication range psychiatric neurological condition . Early pharmacological fMRI study suggest tool sensitive enough pick pharmacologically modulate activation brain . Pharmacological fMRI potential testing transmitter model disorder , predict treatment response support development novel compound neuropsychiatry . The main objective study investigate activation signature typical antipsychotic agent dissociable new drug pharmacological profile differs typical atypical antipsychotic since potent partial D2 agonist . For purpose employ fMRI paradigm base finding previous research animal human describe .</detailed_description>
