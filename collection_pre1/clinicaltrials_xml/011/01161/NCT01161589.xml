	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study collect simultaneous , multiple view cardiac signal represent transvenous ICDs ( T-ICD ) sense vector subcutaneous implantable defibrillator system ( S-ICD ) . Upon completion , data represent first true database capable compare detection characteristic transvenous subcutaneous ICDs . Future protocols create dictate specific method comparison .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Arrhythmia Collection Transvenous Simultaneous Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator Data</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The FACTS S-ICD study data gathering study take place implant procedure standard T-ICD system . Patients undergoing routine dual chamber , dual high voltage shock coil T-ICD CRT-D insertion replacement connect external data recorder via sterile cable . Atrial ventricular arrhythmia induce multiple ECG view simultaneously record intracardiac surface vector . These episode digitize create FACTS S-ICD arrhythmia library . As dedicated integrated bipolar sense configuration currently utilized marketplace , data collect use market available ICD sense method . The FACTS S-ICD study enroll sufficient quantity patient minimum 50 atrial 50 ventricular arrhythmic episode collect via dedicate integrated ICD system . S-ICD signal collect record episode . The T-ICD implant procedure complete per normal hospital practice patient dependent data gathering require past implant surgery point surgery arrhythmia induction . INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Age 18 , legal age give consent specific state national law . 2 . Any patient undergoing clinically indicate initial dual chamber T-ICD CRT-D implantation . In addition , patient require replacement exist dual chamber T-ICD CRT-D system eligible enrollment study . 3 . Patient subcutaneous , leave pectoral defibrillator implant . EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Patients unable unwilling provide inform consent . 2 . Any condition precludes subject 's ability comply study requirement , include completion study . 3 . Patients chronic atrial fibrillation sinus rhythm within last six month . 4 . Enrollment concurrent study , without Cameron Health 's write approval , may confound result study . 5 . Women pregnant try become pregnant Note : Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior defibrillator implant . 6 . Patient require leave sub-muscular right side defibrillator implant</detailed_description>
