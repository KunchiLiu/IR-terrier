	<brief_summary>This trial examine impact acute chronic almond ingestion indicator glucose control ( postprandial glycemia hemoglobin A1c ) . Hypotheses : 1 . Almonds stimulate secretion GLP-1 healthy adult adult T2D The investigator able demonstrate relationship GLP-1 secretion almond consumption . Individuals T2D characterize significantly great GLP-1 secretion non-diabetic control subject . 2 . Acute ingestion almonds decrease postprandial glycemia insulinemic response healthy control individual T2D The investigator data support hypothesis : almond consumption individual T2D attenuate postprandial glycemia ; however , almond consumption alter glycemia non-diabetic control subject 3 . Chronic almond ingestion 12 week reduce fast glucose ( FG ) A1c concentration individual T2D The investigator data demonstrate modest beneficial effect almond consumption A1c individual T2D . Almond consumption also associate modest weight loss compare control treatment ( low fat cheese stick ) .</brief_summary>
