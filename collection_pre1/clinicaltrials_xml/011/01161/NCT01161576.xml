	<brief_summary>This propose follow study investigator previous gene transfer human clinical trial entitle `` Administration Replication Deficient Adeno-associated Virus Gene Transfer Vector Expressing Human CLN2 cDNA Brain Children Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis '' ( Weill Cornell IRB # 0401007010 ) . As previous study , investigator propose administer biologic direct gene transfer brain ass safety child fatal genetic disease CNS . The disease Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis ( LINCL , form Batten disease ) . This accomplish use delivery gene ( method call gene transfer ) administer brain experimental drug call AAVRh.10CUhCLN2 , gene transfer vector .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Gene Transfer Vector ( Rh.10 ) Children With Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose assess new drug treat child form Batten Disease call Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis ( LINCL ) . These child bear genetic change call mutation CLN2 gene result inability brain properly recycle protein . The recycling failure lead death nerve cell brain progressive loss brain function . Children Batten disease normal birth age 2 4 motor vision problem progress rapidly death age approximately 10 year old . There therapies available treat disease . The experimental gene transfer procedure treatment investigator propose consist augment abnormal gene good copy . A virus use deliver good gene nerve cell . Since disease due abnormal CLN2 gene , aim study add normal copy CLN2 gene brain affect child try reverse death cell brain . Previously investigator use virus call adeno-associated virus 2 ( AAV2 ) gene delivery system . That study show viral delivery gene safe . We propose use slightly different virus call AAVrh.10 gene delivery system use 2 different dos virus . Children Batten disease get drug inject brain receive extensive neurological assessment interval determine transfer slow rate progress disease . The primary aim study : ( 1 ) ass hypothesis direct administration AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 brain child LINCL achieve safely minimal toxicity ; ( 2 ) evaluate hypothesis direct administration AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 brain child LINCL slow halt progression disease assess neurological rating scale quantitative MRI ( primary variable ) . The investigator recently complete study normal copy gene surgically deliver 12 location brain 10 child LINCL . The child assess number neurological imaging parameter prior gene transfer . The data demonstrate gene transfer well tolerate small impact progression disease suggest high dos well delivery system may provide great benefit . The previous study use viral gene transfer vector adeno-associated virus type 2 ( AAV2 ) dose 2,000,000,000,000 molecule drug ( 2 x 10^12 particle unit ) . The investigator propose similar study delivery identical payload slightly different viral gene delivery system base virus AAVrh.10 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All individual meet follow criterion include without bias gender race/ethnicity . Each case individually review Eligibility Committee comprise 3 physician PI , include pediatric neurosurgeon , pediatric neurologist general pediatrician . 1 . Definitive diagnosis LINCL , base clinical phenotype genotype . The genotype must include least one 5 common CLN2 mutant genotype : C3670T ( nonsense Arg208 stop ) , G3556C ( intron 7 splice ) , G5271C ( Gln422His ) , T4396G ( aberrant splicing , intron 8 ) G4655A ( Cys365Tyr ) . If either parental allele R447H , patient include study . These account total 83 % mutation study Sleat et al11 , 32 82 % mutation studies27 . The study limit one specific genotype ( genetic constitution ) since data regard natural history disease ( Appendix II ) study Steinfeld2 , show , 5 genotype ( genetic constitution ) , LINCL subject similar clinical course . 2 . The subject must age 2 18 year . 3 . Subjects average total score 4 12 WeillCornell LINCL scale , total score outside 95th percentile confidence limit age base historic data . 4 . The subject previously participate gene transfer stem cell study . 5 . Parents study participant must agree comply good faith condition study , include attend required baseline followup assessment , parent legal guardian must give consent child 's participation . 6 . Sexually active subject use contraception treatment 2 month completion treatment . 7 . If asymptomatic ( i.e An LINCL score 12 ) , one old sibling positive genotype clinical manifestation disease . 1 . Presence significant medical neurological condition may disqualify subject participation study , particularly would create unacceptable operative risk risk receive AAVrh.10CUhCLN2 vector , e.g. , malignancy , congenital heart disease , liver renal failure . 2 . Subjects without adequate control seizures . 3 . Subjects heart disease would risk anesthesia history major risk factor hemorrhage . 4 . Subjects participate MRI study . 5 . Concurrent participation FDA approve Investigational New Drug . 6 . Subjects history prolong bleed abnormal platelet function take aspirin . 7 . Renal disease alter renal function define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dl admission . 8 . Abnormal serum sodium , potassium calcium , magnesium , phosphate grade III IV Division AIDS Toxicity Scale . 9 . Hepatic disease alter liver function define SGPT &gt; 150 U/L , Total Bilirubin &gt; 1.3 mg/dL 10 . Immunosuppression define WBC &lt; 3,000/ÂµL admission 11 . Uncorrected coagulopathy baseline period define INR &gt; 1.4 ; PTT &gt; 35 sec ; PLT &lt; 100,000/mm3 . 12 . Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dl &gt; 2 year age , normal serum iron study ) .</criteria>
