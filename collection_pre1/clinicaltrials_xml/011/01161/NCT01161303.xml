	<brief_summary>We develop vitro system include primary epithelial cell culture explant culture bronchial tissue study interaction bronchial mucosa allergen . This approach involve culture bronchial biopsy optimal condition stimulate allergen thus enable u perform dynamic study without need perform several bronchoscopies allow test unapproved substance , could , otherwise , deliver , vivo . We wish apply ex vivo bronchial culture system assess cytokine release moderately severe asthmatic evaluate effect block TNF-alpha signal use anti TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -Alpha Asthma Using Biopsy Explants Primary Bronchial Epithelial Cell Cultures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Volunteers moderately severe asthma recruit carefully characterize term lung function , asthma symptom score , medication usage allergen sensitivity ( blood skin test ) . If suitable , ask withdraw corticosteroid week careful monitoring symptom peak flow undergo fibreoptic bronchoscopy carry previous explant study . Bronchial brushing biopsy carry per standard technique use University medicine . Primary epithelial cell culture establish bronchial brushing use optimise dose anti TNF-alpha require inhibition TNF-alpha induced response . The biopsy place either culture medium alone , allergen extract allergen extract plus anti TNF-alpha antibody culture 24 hour . The biopsy either snap frozen liquid nitrogen analysis cytokine process immunohistochemical analysis . The supernatant study recover analysed cytokine ( IL-5 , IL-8 , IL-13 , MIP 1 alpha RANTES ) release ELISA .</detailed_description>
