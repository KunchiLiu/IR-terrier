	<brief_summary>Protein Losing Enteropathy ( PLE ) serious medical condition may develop child adult congenital heart disease palliative procedure know `` Fontan procedure '' perform . The loss serum proteins gastrointestinal tract associate PLE cause serious symptom life-threatening complication . A number clinical study suggest heparin administration clinical benefit child PLE , however risk bleed associate administration heparin important concern commonly limit administration . ODSH desulfated heparin minimal anticoagulation property , pre-clinical study , appear potential replace heparin greatly reduce risk bleeding . This open label study assess safety evidence therapeutic effect administration ODSH 4-day continuous intravenous infusion patient exacerbation PLE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protein Losing Enteropathy ( PLE ) serious sometimes fatal condition develop approximately 10 % child undergone single ventricle palliative surgery know Fontan procedure . The mechanisms PLE develop fully understood , however recent mechanism propose consistent specific loss heparan sulfate proteoglycans basolateral surface intestinal epithelial cell result loss serum protein include albumin immunoglobulin gastrointestinal tract associate protein lose enteropathy . A number clinical study suggest heparin administration clinical benefit child PLE , however risk bleed consequence treatment important concern commonly limit administration . ODSH ( 2-0 , 3-0 desulfated heparin ) modify heparin preserve anti-inflammatory property heparin minimal anticoagulation effect . ODSH study rodent model PLE show improvement PLE model due restoration heparan sulfate Syndecan 1 stabilization cell matrix capillary endothelium . This open label clinical study enroll 9 subject dose escalation ( 3 dos ) study design . Three subject treat low dose ODSH ad hoc safety committee assess safety information make recommendation regard advance next high dose ODSH , appropriate , 3 dose cohort complete . Plasma albumin fecal alpha 1 antitrypsin biological marker protein loss intestinal lumen condition , primary variable evaluate evidence therapeutic effect together improvement PLE sign symptom . The effect ODSH associate diarrhea , abdominal pain , peripheral edema ascites evaluate use visual/categorical scale patient assess symptoms clinical evaluation investigator .</detailed_description>
