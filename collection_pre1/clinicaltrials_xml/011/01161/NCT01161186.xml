	<detailed_description>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) represent fourth lead cause cancer-related mortality United States , estimate 35,240 death attributable PDAC 2009 ( 1 ) . Over 90 % patient inoperable disease presentation , point systemic therapy become primary form treatment . Single agent gemcitabine become standard care advance pancreatic cancer decade ago since demonstrate improve survival compare fluorouracil . Since , number phase III trial evaluate benefit add additional cytotoxic target agent gemcitabine ( 2-17 ) . The PA.3 trial ( 15 ) , lead approval erlotinib advance pancreatic cancer , landmark study represent first positive phase III study combination regimen disease indication ; however , erlotinib represent important proof principle welcome addition therapeutic armamentarium , fail gain significant traction disease , many oncology community consider marginal absolute improvement median overall survival questionable clinical significance . While study individually fail consistently demonstrate survival advantage gemcitabine-based combination therapy , recent meta-analysis show addition either platinum analog fluoropyrimidine gemcitabine result significant improvement overall survival compare gemcitabine alone , particularly patient preserve performance status ( 18 ) . As described follow section , combination gemcitabine capecitabine may particularly attractive cytotoxic doublet build upon . Gemcitabine/capecitabine pancreatic cancer Gemcitabine capecitabine demonstrate synergy pre-clinical study , think due several mechanism . Capecitabine convert fluorouracil tissue pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PyNPase ) , over-expressed many tumor ( 19 ) . In breast cancer xenograft model , gemcitabine show cause increase expression PyNPase , may turn enhance conversion capecitabine 5-FU ( 20 ) . An intermediate gemcitabine also lead enhance bind active metabolite 5-FU thymidylate synthase , augment action capecitabine ( 21 ) . Preliminary analysis one study show significant survival benefit combination arm ( overall survival 7.4 month versus 6 month ; 1 year survival 26 % versus 19 % ) ; however , final data trial yet publish ( 3 ) . A subsequent phase III Swiss trial demonstrate significant improvement overall survival combination gemcitabine/capecitabine compare gemcitabine alone ; however , subset analysis patient good performance status ( KPS 90-100 ) show significant survival improvement 7.4 month 10.1 month receive combination regimen ( 4 ) . Several strategy may optimize dose , schedule , administration gemcitabine capecitabine . First , delivery gemcitabine fixed-dose rate infusion ( FDR ) ( 10 mg/m2/min ) maximize intracellular accumulation triphosphate form drug . This approach evaluate randomized phase II phase III cooperative group trial ( ECOG 6201 ) , suggestion benefit compare standard-infusion gemcitabine give 30 minute ( 9 , 22 ) . Second , administer capecitabine biweekly fashion ( 7 day follow 7 day ) rather standard 2-week , 1-week fashion may allow dose intensification without increase toxicity ( 23 , 24 ) ( see also Part E. ) . The GTX Regimen The addition taxane gemcitabine/capecitabine previously evaluate so-called GTX regimen ( fixed-dose rate gemcitabine , docetaxel , capecitabine ) ( 26 ) . Studies GTX advance pancreatic cancer patient ( 26 , 27 ) locally advance unresectable disease ( 28 ) reveal encouraging efficacy data . Abraxane ( nab-paclitaxel ) Abraxane ( nab-paclitaxel , nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel ; formerly ABI-007 ) Cremophor® EL-free , albumin-bound form paclitaxel mean particle size approximately 130 nanometer . This composition provide novel approach increase intra-tumoral concentration drug receptor-mediated transport process allow transcytosis across endothelial cell . Preclinical study compare Abraxane Taxol ( paclitaxel Cremophor EL solvent-based , BMS ) demonstrate low toxicity , MTD approximately 50 % high Abraxane compare Taxol . At equal dos le myelosuppression improve efficacy xenograft tumor model human mammary adenocarcinoma . At equitoxic dos paclitaxel , Abraxane find markedly efficacious Taxol ( 29 ) . The current FDA-approved indication Abraxane treatment breast cancer failure combination chemotherapy metastatic disease relapse within 6 month adjuvant chemotherapy ( prior therapy include anthracycline unless clinically contraindicate ) . Our choice nab-paclitaxel proposal base provocative preclinical clinical data suggest efficacy agent pancreatic cancer . Specifically , bind nab-paclitaxel albumin specific receptor ( gp60 ) lead subsequent activation protein caveolin-1 , mediate internalization compound endothelial cell transport bloodstream tumor interstitium . SPARC ( Secreted Protein And Rich Cysteine ) , tumor-secreted protein , bind albumin , release active drug tumor cell membrane , thereby increase concentration target site action . SPARC known over-expressed pancreatic cancer , lead interest study nab-paclitaxel disease . The combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine advance pancreatic cancer demonstrate promising result phase I/II study ( 31 ) . In study , maximum tolerate dose nab-paclitaxel give concurrently gemcitabine 125 mg/m2 , agent administer weekly x 3 4 . This combination nab-paclitaxel ( 125 mg/m2 ) gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2 ) also show well tolerated phase II trial metastatic breast cancer ( 32 ) , agent administer 2-week-on , 1-week-off schedule . Of note , pivotal study upon nab-paclitaxel approve use breast cancer use dose 260 mg/m2 , single agent , every 3 week schedule . The dos nab-paclitaxel test propose dose-escalation trial , combine gemcitabine capecitabine use alternating-week dose schedule , range 75 150 mg/m2 .</detailed_description>
