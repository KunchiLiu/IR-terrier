	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance child universal concern . The prevalence sleep disorder may high 80 % child neurodevelopmental disability . The majority parental complaint difficulty get child settle sleep night stay asleep ( insomnia ) . Two recent study compare child epilepsy match control sibling control conclude child epilepsy daytime sleepiness may due underlie sleep disorder , significantly great sleep problem non-epileptic peer . Endogenous melatonin think synchronize sleep-wake pattern light-dark cycle normal day . Exogenous melatonin find effective reduce sleep onset latency , increase sleep duration , increase sleep efficiency meta-analysis subject sleep disorder . The melatonin fast release preparation release quickly short half-life le 1 hour . It helpful decrease sleep onset latency ( time fall asleep ) . The melatonin time release tablet release slow sustained way , small study child severe neurodevelopmental disability , useful sleep maintenance . Fast release melatonin show effective study child multiple disability one trial child epilepsy . Further rigorous evaluation melatonin need validity study limit lack blinding , small sample size , subjective method sleep-wake outcome evaluation .</detailed_description>
