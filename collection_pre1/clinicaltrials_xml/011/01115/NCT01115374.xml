	<detailed_description>Lymphedema , sequela breast cancer breast cancer therapy , change functional ability may affect patient 's psychosocial adjustment overall quality life . Lymphedema accumulation lymph fluid interstitial space . Fluid accumulation limb cause enlargement , often feel heaviness.Chronic inflammation lead fibrosis lymphatics , compound problem . Several study examine incidence lymphedema axillary radiation give axillary dissection v radiation undissected axilla . The risk lymphedema high woman treat axillary dissection adjuvant radiation axilla , edema report 9 % 40 % patient . Patients lymphedema may report symptom sensation arm fullness mild discomfort , see early stage condition . Joint immobility , pain , skin change note frequently later stage lymphedema . Patients also may predispose infection involve affected extremity . The treatment lymphedema associate breast cancer include complex decongestive physiotherapy , compression therapy , therapeutic exercise , pharmacotherapy . Manual lymphatic drainage standard decongestive therapy . Recently , low frequency sound wave use reduce lymphedema . The aim study compare efficacy manual lymphatic drainage versus low frequency sound wave .</detailed_description>
