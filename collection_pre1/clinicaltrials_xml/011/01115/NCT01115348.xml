	<brief_summary>Stroke common cause motor disability grown-up population Western world . In Sweden &gt; 80 % 65 year age onset ( 1 ) .Areas brain , control movement upper extremity ( UE ) often damage stroke , lead impaired function . This impairment UE often lead limitation activity daily live reduction level social activity ; therefore , intervention improve function need reduce consequence person live stroke . The time course recovery UE clear therefore optimal time intervention person content ( way intervention ) uncertain . The investigator develop objective assessment motor performance new technology ( kinematic analysis virtual reality haptics ) . Since impaired UE often result reduce capacity daily live social activity , might lead decreased participation . To complement traditional focus body function , need assessment person 's activity level participation , well self-perceived function . The result study lay ground intervention study focus improve function upper extremity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tools objectively assess upper extremity function activity Grippit : The handgrip force record , peak maximum grip force mean value ten-second sustain grip right hand Kinematics : An optoelectronic system use three-dimensional motion analysis . This system include advanced optoelectronic camera system produce clean accurate 3D data . Ball shape marker position body , reflect infrared light camera flash . Data analysis perform special software . The drinking task test perform person sit standardized manner ARAT ( Action research Arm Test ) performance test UE function dexterity . VR The user observe 3D image display tabletop use stereographic shuttered glass . The user able reach virtual space interact 3-dimensional object , haptic device , create illusion manipulate virtual object . Tool ass self perceive function activity ABILHAND questionnaire aim measure manual ability chronic stroke . It interview base focus perceived difficulty everyday activity contain unimanual bimanual activity . Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) scale person reply perception regard life stroke.. Impact participation autonomy ( IPA-E ) ; instrument person estimate perceive handicap autonomy person live community</detailed_description>
