	<brief_summary>The study aim determine whether proprietary , FDA approve stiffen wire improve efficiency colonoscopy ( , decrease duration procedure ) and/or enable complete visualization colon great proportion case ( procedure perform without ) old , use colonoscope . Colonoscopes design delicate balance stiffness flexibility . Stiffness help prevent curling ( loop ) colonoscope section colon fix wall abdominal cavity flexibility enable successful negotiation bend flexure colon . As colonoscopes age , lose stiffness make challenge advance colonoscope way cecum ( upper end colon ) . Even cecum successfully reach , may take inordinately long time . In Jamaica , endoscopists ( General Surgeons Gastroenterologists ) use old , pre-owned colonoscope import USA , average patient local health insurance company bear level fee would enable cost recovery new equipment . The stiffening wire ( two grade stiffness ) use study pass biopsy channel colonoscope tip pass upper end descend colon enter transverse colon . The device safe use recommend manufacturer ( approved FDA ) , appear increase risk risk colonoscopy unassisted colonoscope . Although device clearly improve stiffness colonoscope , research evidence actually work practice , either improve cecal intubation rate decrease procedure time . It therefore also unclear whether possible benefit use device achieve introduce first opportunity allow manufacturer difficulty encounter unassisted colonoscope . In study , patient randomly assign one 3 `` intervention '' . One group colonoscopy perform colonoscope alone wire introduced difficulty advance colonoscope pass transverse colon ( `` difficulty '' define failure advance tip colonoscope 5 minute ) . In 2nd 3rd group , assign wire introduce soon colonoscope enters transverse colon remove `` difficulty '' encounter , define . The different phase colonoscopy time stop watch sufficient number patient accrue , investigator able compare time take complete procedure without wire well proportion case cecum reach without assistance wire .</brief_summary>
