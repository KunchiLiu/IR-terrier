Randomization one patient 's extremity ( either one elbow one knee ) treatment group occur time enrollment . Randomization sequence right side assign odd numbered patient leave side assign even numbered patient . Thus , first patient enrol , patient number one , would randomize treatment right side . Depending site active disease , would apply topical dapsone gel , 5 % right elbow knee twice daily duration study . No blind patient PI occur . The co-investigator blind whether photograph present end study treat untreated extremity . The patient screen study enrollment private clinic room within dermatology clinic One Hundred Oaks .
