	<brief_title>Supervised Walking Groups Model Increase Physical Activity Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regular , moderate-intensity physical activity attenuate hyperglycemia subject type 2 diabetes . In addition , programme may favourably affect several cardiovascular risk factor subject . However , still remain unclear evidence transfer clinical practice , consider large number diabetic patient characteristic population , make predominantly elderly , sedentary overweight patient . In regard , realistic approach issue require simple easily available intervention model . Walking typical mild-moderate aerobic physical activity easy organize require specific skill preliminary sophisticate medical evaluation . This activity could therefore fit well need involvement large number patient different logistic situation . However , report , due low walk speed typical type 2 diabetic subject , self-paced walk inadequate obtain significant metabolic improvement subject .</detailed_description>
