	<brief_summary>The main purpose study compare two type treatment hydrocephalus : placement ventriculoperitoneal ( VP ) shunt versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy ( ETV ) . A second goal study understand two different type procedure , VP shunt versus ETV , affect brain blood flow pressure . Understanding change important investigator hope someday able predict well respond one procedure another .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management normal pressure hydrocephalus ( NPH ) challenge due diagnostic uncertainty high treatment risk . To date , evidence-based treatment standard disorder . Our long-term goal improve outcome NPH improve understanding cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) hydrodynamics . The Specific Aims 1 ) determine value high volume tap test , 2 ) determine whether intracranial hemo/hydrodynamic variable , measure shunt operation , support tuned-dynamic absorber model intracranial pressure dynamic . The study 's Aim relate model complex hydro- hemodynamics intracranial physiology-pathology . We hypothesize current hydrocephalus model over-simplistic shunt-induced hydrodynamics well model base ICP waveform characteristic application novel dynamic model . Much data Aim passively record routine care patient . In essence , add noninvasive MRI study TCD ( transcranial Doppler ) study . The experimental methodology aim alter intracranial compartment compliance place patient various position phase difference detect . The simple way alter intracranial compliance make postural change . When patient Trendelenburg position , venous outflow brain hinder resulting increase ICP presumably reduction compliance . Conversely , raise head bed 60 degree result opposite effect . The second mechanism alter compliance ( ICP ) occur result treat hydrocephalus CSF shunt . Because able study hydrocephalus patient prior shunt part diagnostic workup , create new state shunt allow u characterize intracranial system .</detailed_description>
