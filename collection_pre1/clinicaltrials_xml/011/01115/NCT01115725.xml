	<brief_summary>This prospective , open-label , non-comparative , multicentric Phase 4 study evaluate ease use , local tolerance , safety effectiveness Gonal-f® ( filled-by-mass prefilled pen ) subject undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( r-FSH ) . Clarification change study type : The study erroneously register interventional trial ClinicalTrials.gov 2010 2012 . It show recently study protocol conduct study include clinical intervention beyond Standard Clinical Practice approve label Gonal-f® . Furthermore , relevant study essential documentation ( e.g . Informed Consent , CRF , etc . ) line observational study design . As per EU regulation ( Article 2 ( c ) Directive 2001/20/EC ) , study 'non-interventional trial ' .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment subfertility infertility assist reproduction technology ( ART ) IVF embryo transfer ( ET ) require multiple follicular development increase number female gamete , chance successful treatment outcome . Ovarian stimulation IVF ICSI currently include suppression endogenous luteinizing hormone ( LH ) secretion administration gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist , follow stimulation multiple follicular development exogenous FSH administration . When adequate follicular development achieve , single dose u-hCG ( urinary-human chorionic gonadotropin ) administer mimic endogenous LH surge induce final oocyte maturation . Recombinant-human FSH ( r-hFSH ) show superior u-hFSH ( urinary-derived FSH ) term require few ampoule efficacious term number oocyte recover term pregnancy rate . Recently , new formulation follitropin alfa develop next step innovation Serono capitalize fact Serono recognize follitropin alfa manufacturing highly control control specific activity allow filling product mass guarantee dose deliver . Until follitropin alfa produce lyophilisate injection ( either single dose multidose application ) glass ampoule glass vial administer use syrinx . Today , Gonal-f® fill-by-mass available new liquid formulation administer pen device prefilled hence subject assemble device make simple use . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : To evaluate ease-of-use Gonal-f® ( fill mass prefilled pen ) subject undergoing IVF/ICSI . Secondary objective : To evaluate local tolerance , safety effectiveness Gonal-f® prefilled pen .</detailed_description>
