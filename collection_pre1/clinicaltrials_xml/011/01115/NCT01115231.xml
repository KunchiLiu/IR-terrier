	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) slowly progress multifactorial disease involve genetic abnormality environmental insult . AMD lead cause blindness Americans age sixty . As population age , prevalence AMD continue grow , reach maximum risk rate ~30 % age 70 year . Since smoking increase risk AMD , 20 % high incidence smoking Veteran population U.S. adult civilian population , U.S. Department Veterans Affairs healthcare system provide care potentially 7 million AMD case . Currently available treatment focus late stage disease ( choroidal neovascularization ) ; however , treatment come significant risk target subpopulation AMD patient . No treatment available early AMD disease include &gt; 85 % case . Thus , paramount importance investigator learn detect AMD early develop treatment allow early disease prevention . While mechanistic study show inflammation smoke fundamental component wet dry form AMD , genetic study demonstrate polymorphisms different complement protein increase risk develop AMD . One detrimental mutation occur factor H , essential inhibitor complement cascade . Overall , hypothesized inadequate control complement-driven inflammation may major factor disease pathogenesis AMD . Here investigator wish answer essential question : smoking complement act synergistically AMD disease process . For proposal investigator guide investigator ' overall hypothesis pathological activation alternative complement pathway direct effect retinal pigment epithelium , generate permissive cellular environment AMD pathology . Thus , investigator recruit case subject AMD control subject , select smoker non-smokers group , determine whether smoke influence complement activation , whether smoke act yet undefined pathway promote AMD development . A complete eye exam determine pathology visual impairment perform Day 1 study . Serum analyzed measure complement factor H activity . Plasma analyzed measure complement breakdown product C3a , C5a Bb . The cell remain used genotyping . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A ) Study design This study design determine whether smoke increase complement activation whether specific AMD genotype particularly sensitive elevate level serum complement component . Thus , investigator recruit patient AMD age-matched ( within 5 year ) control subject , select smoker non-smokers , determine whether smoke influence complement activation , whether smoke act yet undefined pathway promote AMD development . A complete eye exam determine pathology visual impairment perform Day 1 study . Serum analyzed measure complement factor H activity . Plasma analyzed measure complement breakdown product C3a , C5a Bb . The cell remain used genotyping . Data collection analysis perform trained professional mask patient evaluation data . B ) Selection subject control Case subject age-matched ( within 5 year ) control subject recruit protocol approve Johnson DeBakey VA Medical Centers , Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) Human Investigation Review Board . All patient provide write informed-consent form signature acceptance participation study . The case subject control subject derive military service Veteran population . The following criterion use inclusion exclusion , sample size , recruitment subject study base previous , successful study conduct investigator ' consultant , Dr. A O Edwards . Inclusion Criteria 1 . Case subject clear diagnosis AMD least 20/40 view fundus . 2 . Control subject &lt; 5 small ( &lt; 63 um ) hard drusen least 20/40 view fundus . 3 . All subject ability provide blood sample . 4 . All subject demonstrate absence exclusion criterion list . 5 . All subject must able provide consent , legal representative available provide consent . 6 . All subject must able complete aspect test , legal representative available complete aspect test . 7 . All subject must generally good medical health opinion study physician . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Individuals unable provide consent lack legal representative . 2 . Individuals whose best correct visual acuity eye bad 20/40 . 3 . Individuals take medication know cause retinopathy . 4 . Individuals unable cooperate complete testing . 5 . Individuals present medium opacity ( cataract ) prevent visualization macula ; ocular disease might simulate AMD preclude diagnosis ( e.g. , prior laser photocoagulation , cryopexy , medium opacity , inflammatory disease ) . 6 . Individuals exhibit disease phenotypically overlap AMD drusen pigmentary disturbance retinal pigment epithelium ; provide insufficient evidence diagnose AMD . 7 . Individuals present macular dystrophy , toxoplasmosis , histoplasmosis , degenerative myopia , central serous chorioretinopathy , disease treatment would diminish ability recognize drusen laser photocoagulation , prior retinal detachment surgery , posterior uveitis , trauma . Sample Size Power Estimation A total 150 case subject 150 control subject ( age-matched within 5 year ) recruit study . This sample size determine statistically simulate study finding 1,000-times use follow assumption : alpha level 0.05 ; 2-sided hypothesis testing ; expect distribution across CC , CT , TT factor H genotypes 8.1 % , 52 % , 39.9 % , respectively , ( combine observe data Caucasians African Americans [ 1 ] ) . The investigator also assume approximately 35 % case control subject would current smoker ( see http : //www.mit.edu/people/jeffrey/HarrisVARept97.pdf ; report commission Department Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary Policy Planning ) . Finally , investigator assume smoke status combination haplotype status multiplicative interactive effect measurement parameter interest ( i.e. , complement protein Ba , D C3d level ) . That , smoking allow negligible impact measurement parameter among low-risk genotype , heterozygous homozygous risk genotype 1.5-fold 2-fold great measurement , respectively . The simulation also include direct effect AMD status ( case/control ) , AMD case higher value control . Through simulation process , investigator able show sample size 150 case 150 control would provide 85 % power detect significant smoking genotype interaction , main focus study . Note investigator ' sample size comparable similar prior study , one use 112 AMD patient 67 control [ 2 ] , another use 274 sample [ 3 ] conduct investigator ' collaborator , Dr. Edwards . Recruitment Case age-matched ( within 5 year ) control subject recruit . Recruitment take place two way : 1 ) If patient see VA within last two year , diagnose AMD qualify control subject , call see whether wish participate study . Those subject wish participate give consent form read sign next VA visit . They ask provide information smoking status , blood sample ( two 3 mL tube ) collect . 2 ) Patients also recruit diagnosis doctor 's office ( i.e. , diagnose AMD qualify control subject ) . Upon signed consent , subject also ask provide information smoking status , blood sample ( two 3 mL tube ) collect . Flyers post VA alert patient clinical trila flyer make available ophthalmologist area provide patient . C ) Clinical test diagnosis AMD Flowchart patient medical history workup 1 . Chief complaint vision change . 2 . History take vision change . If AMD-related symptom ( blurry vision , metamorphopsia , scotoma , etc . ) , approximate time start affected eye , particularly note whether patient take vitamin ( specific type dosing ) , whether previous treatment AMD provide ( type , dose , frequency ) . 3 . If eye problem disease , stroke heart attack history , surgery plan future , rheumatologic disease , kidney disease ( MPGN-II ) . 4 . Any family history AMD . 5 . Medications currently take . 6 . Social history , include smoke behavior ( year smoke packs/ week packs/ year . Eye examination , include Snellen visual acuity pinhole test 1 . Pupillary exam , follow confrontational visual field visual field test determine amount vision loss . 2 . Intraocular pressure assess Tonopen tonometry . 3 . Pharmacologically-dilated pupil use phenylephrine 2.5 % 1 % tropicamide . 4 . Slit-lamp examination include non-contact-lens exam macula peripheral retina determine anatomical alteration fundus . 5 . If recent significant vision change occur , blood , exudate subretinal fluid note fundus exam , ancillary test include macular SD-OCT ( eye ) fluorescein angiography ( eye ) perform arterial phase eye concern . Treatment option 1 . If active choroidal neovascular membrane find examination ancillary testing , treatment option ( anti-VEGF-based therapy Lucentis , Macugen , Avastin ) discuss . 2 . If intermediate AMD determine eye , advance AMD one eye , treatment option ( AREDS vitamin supplement , need self-monitor central vision change ) discuss . Tests Confrontational visual field The examiner ask patient cover one eye stare examiner . The examiner move his/her hand patient 's visual field bring back . The patient signal hand come back view . This frequently do examiner simple preliminary test . Tonometry Intraocular pressure measure Tonopen central cornea primary-gaze up-gaze . Eye exam Eyes dilate ( mydriasis one drop ( 2.5 % phenylepinephrin 1 % tropicamide ) achieve least 6 mm pupil diameter , back eye examine slit-lamp . OCT image OCT image acquire Stratus-OCT image system ( Carl Zeiss Meditec ) . Images obtain use high-resolution `` Radial Lines '' protocol six high-resolution B-scans ( transverse resolution 512 A-scans per B-scan ) . Total retinal volume value provide `` Retinal Map Analysis '' program Stratus software . Data analyze qualitatively base automated measurement provide Stratus-OCT software . Choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) size quantitatively measure , include maximum CNV diameter well maximum CNV thickness . Retinal structure qualitatively judge ( 1 ) wet , reveal unchanged fluid condition ; ( 2 ) dry , reveal fluid ; ( 3 ) less edema , reveal incomplete fluid regression . Fluorescein angiography The fluorescein angiogram contain stereoscopic view 2 field specify time injection . These field include macula ( Field 2 ) disc field ( Field 1 ) . Stereoscopic red-free photograph take macula prior injection fluorescein dye . Fluorescein inject rapidly ( less 5 second ) either anticubital convenient vein accord usual clinic protocol . Photographs take time zero moment injection complete control photograph , document integrity interference filter document rate injection . Stereo pair Field 2 Field 1M study eye take minute 1 3 , follow two additional pair 5 minute 10 minute . Biospecimens Two tube ( 3 mL ) whole blood collect Johnson DeBakey VA Medical Center laboratory service personnel process freezer ( -80 C ) within 3 hour collection . One tube collect allow clot . Serum separate clot centrifugation ( 10 minute 3,000 rpm ) freeze -80 degree centigrade analyze . Serum use measure complement factor H activity . The tube contain dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , result final EDTA concentration 4.5 mM blood add . Plasma separate whole blood centrifugation ( 10 minute 3,000 rpm ) freeze -80 degree centigrade analyze . Plasma use measure complement breakdown product . The cell remain used genotyping assay . ELISA protein analyse ELISA examination describe detail investigator ' collaborator , Dr. Edwards [ 3 ] ; however , protocol describe brief . - Factor B quantify use monoclonal capture antibody P21/15 recognize epitope present factor B Ba biotinylated rabbit anti-Bb detection antibody . For measurement Ba , plasma deplete factor B use Biomag magnetic bead couple anti-B/Bb antibody ( mAb M13/12 ) , follow Ba quantification use anti-B/Ba antibody ( mAb P21/15 ) capture antibody biotinylated antibody specific epitope B/Ba ( mAb M20/6 ) detection antibody . - Factor D measure paired capture detection antibody ( mAb D10/4 biotinylated mAb I8/1 ) specific factor D. The capture antibody use C3d assay ( mAb I3/15 ) react neoepitope present C3b , iC3b C3dg combination biotinylated rabbit anti-C3d detection antibody quantification C3d . For assay , incubation detection antibody follow application streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate . The substrate , 2 mM ABTS ( 2,2'-azino-di- ( 3-ethyl benzthiazolinesulfonate ) ) buffer contain 2.5 mM peroxide , add absorbance 410 nm ( 490 nm reference ) read use microplate photometer . All sample run triplicate . Assessment smoke Regular cigarette smoking assess brief questionnaire administer clinic staff , determine whether subject ever smoke regular basis whether he/she current smoker ; , pack/month pack/year history . D ) Outcome measure Incidence The incidence AMD define base publish definition Rotterdam Study , population-based prospective cohort study Rotterdam , The Netherlands , 6,780 total population 10,275 participant age 55 year , participate ophthalmic examination [ 4 ] . Fundus photograph The fundus photograph grade 12.5x magnification , accord International Classification Grading System ARM AMD ( The International ARM Epidemiological Study Group , 1995 ) . In system , ARM fundus sign within standard circular area ( diameter 6,000 ) around fovea record . Graders , train accord Wisconsin ARM grading system grade photograph blind patient information . AMD definition - AMD define presence large ( 63 um ) , soft , distinct drusen pigmentary irregularity , indistinct ( 125 um ) reticular drusen , atrophic neovascular AMD . Atrophic AMD define sharply demarcate round oval area apparent absence retinal pigment epithelium large 175 um , irrespective distance fovea , within grid , visible choroidal vessel neovascular AMD . - Neovascular AMD define presence serous hemorrhagic neuro-retinal retinal pigment epithelium detachment , and/or subretinal neovascular membrane , and/or subretinal hemorrhage , and/or peri-retinal fibrous scar . Lesions consider result generalize disease ( see exclusion criterion ) exclude AMD diagnosis . Additional outcome measurement Additional outcome measure help characterize severity AMD disease include follow . In visual field test , loss vision occur predominantly central retina , quantify . The choroidal retinal vasculature analyze use fluorescein angiogram , reveal abnormal blood vessel leakage subject systemic vascular problem . E ) Data analyse - Data assemble normalized serum level complement factor Ba , C3d fD level initially evaluate univariate statistic assure quality data adequate analysis . The association measure parameter ( i.e. , serum level complement factor ) , AMD diagnosis , smoke assess stratified bivariate fashion use Student test Wilcoxon rank sum test , appropriate , standard measure assessment use check normality , skew , etc . - Multivariate analysis conduct use general linear mixed model [ 5 ] . The model include random subject effect account dependence among repeated measurement subject . This type model ideal multiple measurement subject , laboratory measurement perform triplicate . The dependent variable interest complement level measurement ( log transform , necessary ) , independent variable include AMD status ( case/control ) , factor H genotype ( CC , CT , TT ) , smoke ( current , former , never ) , interaction-term involve factor H genotype smoking status . The interaction-term help u determine whether impact factor H genotype smoking serum complement level linear ( additive ) , non-linear ( e.g. , multiplicative ) . The model also include adjustment age , gender , race , may affect complement factor . Thus , difference among haplotype adjust ( correct ) effect may attribute age , gender , race . Different correlation structure examine random subject effect , investigator use Akaike 's Information Criterion select appropriate model . Secondary analysis involve exclude never smoker , assess nature association ( ) pack/year history . factor H genotype . complement level . An additional analysis ( use conditional logistic regression ) conduct determine whether smoke interacts subject 's factor H genotype respect risk AMD . Again , model adjust age , gender , race , result express odds ratio associate risk AMD . F ) Predicted result interpretation Published result , well data investigator ' collaborator , Dr. Edwards , provide ample evidence AMD correlate increase serum level Ba , C3d fD ; whereas elevated level Ba C3d document V62I subject . The investigator expect confirm extend finding V62I subject , identify positive correlation elevate level complement activation protein Y402H . Since smoke exposure show result increase level alternative pathway ( AP ) activation [ 6 ] , investigator predict component ( i.e. , C3d Ba ) might elevate factor H risk population smoke . G ) Potential risk Subjects receive comprehensive eye examination part study . This examination include visual inspection train ophthalmologist , assessment visual acuity , SD-OCT , visual field , fluorescein angiography . The subject physician make aware identified abnormality . The potential risk subject modest . All planned test identical test routinely perform purpose diagnose AMD diseases eye . Such study perform routinely out-patient setting ophthalmologist . In addition , information obtain study may provide important link understanding pathogenesis AMD , link complement factor H haplotypes smoke . Any relationship three could potentially lead future therapy AMD . - Visual field test . The risk visual field test include fatigue neck ; pain neck ; pressure chin ; sweat ; photophobia ; tear . None permanent substantial loss . Change position rest resolve complication . - Tonometry . The risk tonometry include fatigue neck ; pain neck ; pressure chin ; feel temporary pressure eye . None permanent substantial loss . Change position rest resolve complication . - Pupil dilation . The risk pupil dilation include fatigue neck ; pain neck ; pressure chin ; sweat ; photophobia ; acute angle-closure lasting less 30 minute , due dilate drop ; conjunctival injection ( red eye ) , due dilate drop ; impair near vision le 24 hour , due dilate drop ; burn less 5 minute , due dilate drop ; anesthesia eye le 2 hour , due dilate drop . None permanent substantial loss . Rest time resolve complication . - Stratus-OCT . The risk Stratus-OCT image include fatigue neck ; pain neck ; pressure chin ; sweat ; photophobia ; tear . None permanent substantial loss . Change position rest resolve complication . - Fluorescein angiography . The risk fluorescein angiography include pain needle stick ; inflammation injection site ; allergy fluorescein dye ; feel warmth cold , due dye ; infection site needle stick ; anaphylactic reaction dye ; nausea ( 20 % case ) ; vomit ( 0-7 % case ) ; headache ; hypotension ; convulsion ; basilar artery ischemia ; cardiac arrest ; severe shock ; thrombophlebitis injection site . Clinical staff train deal complication . - Venipuncture whole blood . The risk venipuncture pain bruise site venipuncture ; faint dizziness ; infection site needle stick . None permanent substantial loss . Clinical staff train deal complication . - Personal information . Sharing personal information ( blood specimen , personal history , genetic information , etc . ) without risk . Research identify gene cause contribute disease trait increasingly important way try understand role gene human disease . The participant give consent form Johnson DeBakey VA Medical Centers investigator want include participant ' blood sample research project , want save biological specimen future research . There several thing participant know allow blood study save . 1 . Blood sample store alphanumeric identifier could eventually link participant . Sometimes sample share research purpose investigator research sit . If do , investigator would know participant ' name . 2 . In addition name , information participant might connect blood sample . For instance , information race , ethnicity , sex , medical history , forth might available investigator study blood . Such information important scientific reason sometimes public health . It possible genetic information might come associated participant ' racial ethnic group . 3 . Genetic information participant ' often apply ( one degree another ) family member . It generally Johnson DeBakey VA Medical Center 's policy provide information participant ' family member . However , certain study call `` pedigree study '' , share information among family member . For related research , participant ask willing share genetic information family member . 4 . The participant right refuse allow blood study saved future research study . The participant may withdraw study time remove sample contain identifier research use date withdrawal . This mean Johnson DeBakey VA Medical Centers Medical University South Carolina might retain identified blood sample - law often require - sample would use research . 5 . South Carolina Texas law mandate genetic information , obtain test research , keep confidential . South Carolina Texas law prohibits insurer use information discriminatory manner participant member family issue renew insurance coverage participant family . South Carolina Texas law prohibit investigator share genetic information anyone except narrow circumstance , one research project type , approve Institutional Review Board , investigator must take step protect participant ' identity . The participant still responsible pay health care , however . The Charleston DeBakey VA Medical Centers responsible cost , even care provide condition reveal research clinical testing . 6 . Genetic research raise difficult question inform participant subject result , future result . Some people feel anxious possibility defective gene would place child risk . Some people want know find , others . The risk know include anxiety psychological distress . The risk know find include aware treatment problem study . But risk change depend whether treatment cure particular disease , clear result . If medical reason seek specific information participant , doctor tell . A process call `` genetic counseling '' often appropriate case ; participant ask doctor question . Investigators study may try recontact participant future find health . If participant recontacted want know investigator learn sample , participant understand follow kind thing investigator participant ' health team might say : 1 . The information sketchy give particular detail time , participant receive newsletter inform result project . 2 . The participant carry gene particular disease treat . 3 . The participant carry gene particular disease current treatment . This news might cause severe anxiety psychological distress , depend severity disease . 4 . The participant may carry gene disease might consider inform relative , , might carry gene . It difficult decide whether share information relative . Genetic counselor help sort various option case . Also future research , participant may recontacted new consent form give participant additional information new study . 7 . If participant concerned potential genetic disorder , participant doctor might choose test specifically . This would require additional blood tissue sample would part research project . Participants discuss option doctor genetic counselor . 8 . The presence genetic marker disease necessarily mean participant develop disease . Informing people marker independent medical need cause unnecessary anxiety . On hand , absence marker mean participant get disease . Genetic disease appear result complex mixture heredity , environment , behavioral factor . These best-known risk challenge genetic research . There might risk investigator know yet . It important participant talk doctor , nurse , genetic counselor question concern research study . - Unknown risk . The researcher let participant know learn anything might make change mind participate study . H ) Literature cite 1 . Weale R. ( 2006 ) Lancet 368 , 1235-1236 . 2 .
