	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency common problem world develop country prevalence 64 % ( use WHO cut-off value Hb &lt; 11.0 g/dl ) among child , 9-36 month age . The Pediatric population especially vulnerable iron deficiency anemia due low intake iron rich food , rapid growth high demand loss iron body especially commonly find worm infestation child . Mild moderate iron deficiency widely prevalent child several implication include failure thrive , poor scholastic performance , repeat infection etc . Dietary measure along therapeutic measure recommend combat Iron Deficiency Anemia ( IDA ) . However , iron rich food alone rely upon sole step counter IDA . The utensil food cook play major role determine final iron content food . Several study document food ( 90 % ) contain significantly iron cooked iron utensil depend acidity , moisture content , cook time food.The daily dietary intake could vary 11 6 mg iron iron utensil use cook [ 3 ] . Food cook Aluminum ( Al ) utensils high Al content detrimental healthy individual particularly patient chronic renal failure.In healthy person , diseases central nervous system , well hematopoeitic system , skeletal system respiratory system describe due excess Aluminium consumption . Aluminium utensils fast replace iron cook pot Indian kitchen , hence study know effectiveness iron cooking pot measure combat IDA necessary . Studies show utility cook food iron utensil prevention IDA investigator come across study document use modality treatment IDA child . Since investigator anticipate improvement iron status gradual process , investigator decide evaluate utility cook food iron utensils iron status child non-severe IDA ( Hb % &lt; cutoff point age &gt; 5 gm % . To test follow hypothesis `` use iron utensil cook food result improvement iron status Pediatric patient nonsevere Iron Deficiency Anemia . ''</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Consuming Food Cooked Iron Utensils Iron Status Children With Iron Deficiency Anemia ( IDA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary advice iron therapy consider cornerstone treat patient non-severe IDA . The food rich Iron include meat poultry product , egg , green leafy vegetable , jaggery , dry fruit etc . Iron food two type viz . haem iron non haem iron . Haem Iron excellent bioavailability bioavailability non-haem Iron food stuff considerably affect presence substance like phosphate , phytates , tannins fibre . On hand , Ascorbic acid , sugar acidic substance food enhance iron absorption . The bulk food consume child less provide therapeutic amount iron form diet alone . In develop country , child quite unlikely get poultry product meat source haem Iron . If situation , child provide food cook Iron utensil , provide additional Iron meet increase demand . This cost effective also alter cook practice thereby long term effect iron status entire family . Thus treat IDA index case also benefit family member may borderline overt iron deficiency . This cost effective measure incorporate health policy country certainly widespread positive implication health general population .</detailed_description>
