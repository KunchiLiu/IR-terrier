	<brief_title>Efficacy To Be Marketed ( TBM ) Cholic Acid Capsules Used Treat Children With Inborn Errors Bile Acid Synthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bile acid end product cholesterol metabolism . Individuals inborn error bile acid synthesis lack enzymes need synthesize primary bile acid cholic acid chenodeoxycholic acid ( CDCA ) . These condition serious account approximately 1 % case present idiopathic cholestatic liver disease . The liver disease associate inborn error bile acid synthesis progressive , untreated , may lead death cirrhosis liver failure . Monotherapy cholic acid consider appropriate therapeutic strategy treat inborn error bile acid synthesis provide stimulus bile flow inhibits endogenous production accumulation potentially hepatotoxic cholestatic bile acid precursor , additionally facilitate absorption fat fat-soluble vitamin . At therapeutic dos , adverse effect generally observe , cholic acid become treatment choice Cincinnati Children 's Hospital since 1994 . This study bridge data effectiveness standardize manufactured preparation data obtain patient originally treat currently use cholic acid capsule formulate CCHMC Pharmacy switch manufactured preparation .</detailed_description>
