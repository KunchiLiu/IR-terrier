	<detailed_description>The utility practice Panretinalphotocoagualtion ( PRP ) patient high-risk Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( PDR ) change since ETDRS report guideline 1987 . A meta-analysis DRS ETDRS two large U.S. RCT laser therapy PDR confirm effectiveness PRP ( Level I evidence ) . Both trial large sample size , excellent compliance adequate follow-up . These study establish PRP reduces risk severe visual loss patient high-risk PDR 50 % 60 % 20 . With arrival vitrectomy , surgery often use treat eye severe complication PDR . The common indication vitrectomy nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage , Tractional Retinal Detachment ( TRD ) macular involvement , combine traction rhegmatogenous retinal detachment . With addition new indication know indication vitrectomy perform earlier stage ( severe PDR ) . A large number case series report assess effect par plana vitrectomy diabetic TRD without macular detachment level evidence low include patient homogeneous . These study generally show benefit , improve vision see many patient ( range 22 % 65 % ) also indicate high rate operative postoperative complication . These numerous intra post-operative complication could lead satisfy anatomical result poor vision.The purpose study examine compare , prospectively , best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) outcomes complication cohort patient Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy Tractional Retinal Detachment involve macula undergoing par plana vitrectomy ( PPV ) conventional management ( panretinal photocoagulation )</detailed_description>
