	<brief_summary>This study evaluate use prasugrel 60 mg load dose ( LD ) administer percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) without prior LD clopidogrel platelet inhibition patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Platelet inhibition follow prasugrel LD clopidogrel pretreated patient ' determine time-dependent manner two different prasugrel load dos ( 30 mg 60 mg ) . Understanding effect combination platelet inhibition provide guidance physician use prasugrel patient already pretreated clopidogrel .</brief_summary>
