	<brief_title>GARM II : A Study Genetics Age-related Maculopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( ARM ) major cause vision loss elderly . It think smoke diet may contribute risk develop condition clear heredity play major role . Variations two gene , CFH HTRA1/ARMS2 , find strongly contribute risk develop ARM , additional gene influence person 's chance condition progress vision loss . We investigate genetic variation contribute ARM eventually understand cause complex condition . We study genetic variation ( SNPs ) share among ARM-affected individual within family well compare frequency genetic variation ARM-affected individual unaffected person match age , gender , exposure . We conduct study DNA previous cohort research participant well develop prospective study high-risk family member spouse evaluate genetic risk presymptomatic retinal change . Our long-term goal develop new preventive therapy slow halt development disease able provide treatment great risk experience vision-threatening change . The goal study ( GARM II ) determine combination genetic , dietary , health exposure factor light , diet , smoke contribute one 's risk develop condition . This treatment study involve preventive therapy direct treatment ARM . We aim find insights future preventive strategy group people higher normal risk develop ARM ( family history ) partner represent risk general population . Because ARM complex disease affect many factor , also want know medical condition may associate eye condition . Participants communicate research staff protect , HIPAA-compliant confidential website use website complete number questionnaire course study . For genetic analysis , participant mail easily self-collected saliva sample special container . Eye photograph eye health record send research center local source Internet . Individuals expect come UCLA order participate . http : //jseiclinres.jsei.ucla.edu/garm/</detailed_description>
