	<detailed_description>Antidepressants ( AD ) frequently prescribe class psycho-tropic medication common treatment depression anxiety disorders—yet patient adherence poor widely view contributing reduced effectiveness . Fortunately , AD adherence improve via intervention consistent Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) . However , traditionally-delivered adherence promotion program complex , staff-intensive , costly—barriers wider adoption , implementation , maintenance program real-world setting . Our aim carry trial low-cost , IT-enabled AD adherence program , specifically direct-to-patient , automate telephone interactive voice recognition ( IVR ) intervention boost patient AD persistence . This intervention consistent Chronic Care Model much amenable widespread dissemination large population . In initial startup period investigator adapt pilot exist IVR adherence call script , inform formative focus group interview key informant ( patient , provider ) . Following , investigator conduct pragmatic , randomized clinical trial approximately 6,000 HMO member age 21 75 , recently start incident course AD medication associate unipolar depression and/or anxiety diagnosis . Participants randomize ( 1:1:1:1 ) ; 1. contact control arm , 2. treatment usual ( TAU ) control condition 3. TAU plus IVR automate telephone program 4. TAU plus IVR automate telephone program plus receipt psycho-education material antidepression medication use . Recruitment continue 18 month , periodic participant-level follow-up 40 week . The two IVR intervention deliver reminder and/or tardy call time projected AD refill date . The intervention arm also optionally offer transfer live pharmacist HMO mail refill pharmacy . The primary outcome Estimated Level Persistence Therapy ( ELPT ) ADs , base prescription refill data abstract HMO 's electronic medical record ( EMR ) . We hypothesize participant IVR study plus psycho-ed . arm significantly high rate AD persistence TAU control condition IVR . Secondary medication adherence outcome include continuous measure medication acquisition ( CMA ) continuous measure medication gap ( CMG ) . Other secondary outcome include self-report depression anxiety symptom , general health status , patient provider satisfaction , healthcare cost usage . We also conduct cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) ass value-for-money ( cost per depression free day gain , cost per quality adjust life year gain ) IVR technology compare TAU . Costs include IVR development implementation well EMR-derived healthcare utilization data ( visit , medication , etc . ) , augment participant report out-of-plan service . Finally , evaluative qualitative interview conduct key stakeholder identify barriers/facilitators intervention implementation—keys future dissemination .</detailed_description>
