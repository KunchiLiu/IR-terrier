	<brief_summary>Phase 0 - Open label , Single dose study siG12D LODER Patients operable adenocarcinoma pancreas . The primary endpoint : To assess efficacy local distribution siRNA eight high dose siG12D LODERs patient diagnose operable adenocarcinoma pancreas . The Secondary endpoint : Short term tolerability safety assessment Phase I - This study design investigate safety siG12D LODER ( Local Drug EluteR ) patient diagnose adenocarcinoma pancreas . The primary endpoint : To asses efficacy siG12D LODER local distribution non-operable patient histopathology measurement , local distribution RNA analysis . To define dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) The Secondary endpoint 1 . To determine recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D ) 2 . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 3 . In event surgery , assessment siG12D LODER local distribution efficacy base histopathology measurement RNA analysis . 4 . Progression free survival - long term follow-up</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I - Escalating Dose Study siG12D LODER ( Local Drug EluteR ) Patients With Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma Pancreas , Single Dose Study siG12D LODER ( Local Drug EluteR ) Patients With Non-operable Adenocarcinoma Pancreas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational agent siG12D LODER ( Local Drug EluteR ) miniature biodegradable polymeric matrix encompass anti KRASG12D siRNA ( siG12D ) drug , design release drug regionally within pancreatic tumor , prolonged rate 12-16 week . The majority pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma involve mutation KRAS oncogene ( common G12D ) , therefore stable administration KRASG12D siRNA potential silence lead apoptosis cancer cell thereby slow even halt tumor growth .</detailed_description>
