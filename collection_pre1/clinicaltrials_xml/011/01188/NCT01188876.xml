	<brief_summary>Pralatrexate type antifolate drug mean restrain production folic acid body . Folic acid use tumor increase tumor cell growth division . It believe reduce folic acid hinder rapid division tumor cell , growth production . Carboplatin FDA approve chemotherapy drug ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . Some antifolate drug use chemotherapy drug enhance cancer-fighting characteristic . It believe study drug pralatrexate may improve anti-tumor effect carboplatin . In research study look high dose pralatrexate give safely combination carboplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Carbo/Pralatrexate Rec . Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian , Fallopian Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Since look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect , everyone participates receive dose study drug . - Each study cycle last 28 day . On Day 1 , participant receive carboplatin intravenously . On Days 1 15 cycle receive pralatrexate intravenously . Participants also ask take folic acid orally daily basis start 7 day first dose pralatrexate continue 30 day last dose pralatrexate . They also receive vitamin B12 injection 10 week prior first dose pralatrexate every 8-10 week first dose pralatrexate . - Participants come clinic Day 1 15 cycle follow tests/procedures perform : Medical history ; Vital sign ; Blood test , assessment tumor ( every two cycle ) EKG ( start cycle 2 ) . - In addition , Cycle 1 , participant come clinic weekly blood test . - Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood sample ( monitor body absorb break study drug ) do follow time point Cycle 1 : Day 1-3 Day 15-17 . - Participants ask take study drug 6 cycle . They may continue beyond 6 cycle long evidence tumor grow experience unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
