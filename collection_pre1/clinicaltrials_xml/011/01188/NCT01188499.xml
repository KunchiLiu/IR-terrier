	<criteria>Confirmed advance metastatic malignancy propose chemotherapy regimen appropriate judgment Investigator . Prior therapy doseescalation expansion cohort : Doseescalation cohort : Subjects may naïve may receive prior therapy specific chemotherapeutic agent ( ) recommend combination arm , provide subject experience lifethreatening toxicity attribute specific agent ( ) . Expansion cohort : Subjects advance colorectal cancer previously determine KRAS mutant . Subjects naïve irinotecan may enrol , KRAS mutation status may wild type mutant . Subjects previously treat irinotecan contain regimen may enrol previously determine KRAS wild type . The irinotecan regimen must associate life threaten adverse event . Subjects evaluate Arm 5 ( liposomal doxorubicin ) may receive &gt; 300 mg/m2 cumulative dose anthracycline . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 . Adequate renal function Adequate hepatic function Adequate bone marrow function Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test . Women childbearing potential must agree use 2 method adequate contraception ( ie , hormonal barrier method ) prior enrollment , study , period 30 day follow last dose TL32711 . Males sexually active must agree use condom study period 30 day follow last dose TL32711 , partner childbearing potential , must agree use secondary method contraception ( ie , hormonal , intrauterine device , barrier ) study period 30 day follow last dose TL32711 . Recent anticancer treatment define : Standard investigational anticancer therapy within 4 week prior first dose TL32711 . Exception : continued hormonal intervention prostate cancer . Radiation therapy within 2 week prior first dose TL32711 . Major surgery within 4 week prior first dose TL32711 . Subjects must well recover acute effect surgery prior enrollment . Known suspected diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus chronic active Hepatitis B C. Symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis require current treatment . Impaired cardiac function clinically significant cardiac disease QT interval correct heart rate ( QTcB ) &gt; 480 msec ( include subject medication ) . Lack recovery prior adverse event Grade ≤1 severity ( NCI CTCAE v4 ) ( except alopecia ) due therapy administer prior initiation study drug dose . Nursing pregnant woman . Known allergy formulation component TL32711 . Any concurrent disease and/or medical condition opinion Investigator would prevent subject 's participation , render subject excessive risk ( include excessive risk due toxicity profile plan combination chemotherapeutic regimen ) , limit subject 's compliance protocol 's required evaluation .</criteria>
