	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Immunogenicity Study Recombinant Human C1 Inhibitor Treatment Acute HAE Attacks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HAE characterize recurrent localized angioedema cause uncontrolled activation complement contact system due congenital deficiency functional C1 inhibitor . rhC1INH develop offer widely available therapeutic alternative exist plasma-derived C1INH ( pdC1INH ) product use treatment acute angioedema attack patient HAE . Patients qualify enrollment advance present study center within 5 hour onset attack evaluated eligibility . 75 eligible patient randomize ( 3:2 ) receive intravenous infusion rhC1INH saline double-blind fashion . Open-label rhC1INH may provide rescue medication patient experience begin relief within 4 hour experience life-threatening oropharyngeal-laryngeal angioedema symptom . Any patient receive randomized treatment allow receive treatment rhC1INH open-label fashion subsequent eligible attack .</detailed_description>
