	<brief_summary>More family member provide care love one prolong progressive illness . Chronic intense caregiving represent situation chronic stress , take toll one 's mental physical health include increase risk development worsen heart disease . Identification effective self-care intervention family caregiver warrant improve emotional wellbeing minimize harmful effect chronic stress heart . This Program Project Grant aim promote health reduce cardiovascular risk family caregiver ( FCG ) person chronic illness . In two study investigator test two intervention , psycho-education ( ED ) physical exercise ( EX ) , individually combination . The first study target FCG African American dementia patient ; second focus FCG heart failure patient . Parallel design , intervention measure create synergy integration data management analysis within Bio-behavioral Science Measures Core . This Core also provide high level guidance interpretation model test result analysis common data set . The combined de-identified data set allow elucidate biological mechanism stress-induced cardiovascular risk , develop model , stimulate future research , share core support provide substantial efficiency ; neither could achieve outside Program Project approach . These collective effort generate important data whereby future care significantly enhance life FCG minimize risk cardiovascular disease , number one cause disability death United States . We hypothesize FCGs receive combine PSYCHED+EX intervention well psychological functioning ( low level depressive symptom , anxiety , caregiver burden high level flourish ) , behavioral outcome ( improved sleep quality great physical function ) , cardiovascular risk measure ( improve rest heart rate , blood pressure , heart rate recovery , oxygen consumption , lipid , glucose , inflammatory marker ) , neuroendocrine function ( salivary cortisol ) overall health outcome ( improve function , muscle strength , endurance ) compare psycho-education usual care-attention control baseline six month later mediate improvement process outcome ( low perceive stress high self-efficacy ) .</brief_summary>
