	<brief_summary>DNA vaccine , small piece DNA also known plasmid , several advantage traditional vaccine live attenuate virus recombinant protein-based vaccine . DNA vaccine appear well tolerated human . Therefore , investigator develop DNA vaccine , VGX-3100 , include plasmid target E6 E7 proteins HPV subtypes 16 18 . The investigator choose deliver candidate vaccine via electroporation ( EP ) use CELLECTRA constant current device deliver small electric charge follow intramuscular ( IM ) injection , since animal study show delivery method increase immune response DNA vaccine lead decrease size tumor cause HPV 16 18 . In study HPV-001 , vaccine give subject history CIN 2 3 previously treat surgery . This study propose vaccinate subject fourth dose VGX-3100 determine safety immune response .</brief_summary>
