	<brief_summary>LE-DT novel , proprietary delivery system docetaxel develop NeoPharm , Inc. Docetaxel ( currently market Taxotere ) anti-microtubular network agent one active agent treatment metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) variety cancer . Taxotere poor solubility design administer Tween 80 ethanol . This vehicle cause acute hypersensitivity reaction . By remove toxic detergent use Taxotere , form LE-DT , show reduce toxicity comparable therapeutic efficacy pre-clinical study . The clinical evidence obtain NeoPharm Phase I study show few side effect possibly administer high dose induce great effectiveness LE-DT . The current Phase II study design accomplish follow objective : 1 . Assess antitumor effect indicator serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) follow intravenous ( IV ) administration 110 mg/m2 LE-DT every three week patient metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer 2 . To evaluate measurable soft tissue disease response use response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST ) methodology 3 . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) 4 . To correlate PSA expression tumor response 5 . To evaluate safety LE-DT 110 mg/m2 level , particular peripheral neuropathy , water retention well myelotoxicity 6 . To evaluate quality life ( QOL )</brief_summary>
