	<brief_summary>The majority teeth utilized fabrication conventional complete denture make acrylic resin . These acrylic teeth provide increase bond strength denture base much easy adjust correct denture occlusion compare teeth make harder material , porcelain . However , acrylic teeth wear faster porcelain teeth , lead alteration teeth contact denture replace periodically ( typically every 5-8 year ) . With increase bite chew force achieve function denture support dental implant , rate tooth wear may increase , lead frequent need replacement prosthesis . Acrylic teeth make nano hybrid composite material ( NHC ) potentially offer great wear resistance aesthetic characteristic . The NHC teeth employ wide range filler , include highly cross-linked organic macrofillers , high-density inorganic microfillers silanized silica base nanofillers . The macrofillers , large part , responsible adequate strength color-stability teeth , whereas microfillers improve wear resistance . The nanofillers offer fundamentally different optical behaviour large filler , improve light reflection without lower translucency . This offer additional opportunity development composite teeth , exhibit lifelike aesthetic translucency . These teeth make nano-particles hybrid composite make two different technique , one material press together another use injection technique . The injection method find well aesthetic result , resistance wear clinical use establish . The purpose study evaluate wear characteristic new resin denture teeth ( nano particle - hybrid composite ) make injection technique . Twenty-four edentulous subject enrol complete implant placement mandibular implant overdentures oppose maxillary complete denture implant overdenture , patient previously receive denture interested new denture . Both maxillary mandibular denture fabricate use injection mold nano-hybrid composite denture teeth . The wear denture teeth evaluate use stereophotographic recording baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month denture treatment .</brief_summary>
