	<brief_summary>This study patient 21 year age tumor call low grade glioma central nervous system ( brain spinal cord ) . The tumor grown despite attempt control chemotherapy radiation . Low grade glioma group tumor tend grow slowly could cure every bit tumor surgically remove . These tumor call Grade I II astrocytomas . These tumor often grow part brain prevent total removal without devastate neurologic complication death . Although low grade glioma never grow , treat either chemotherapy radiation . There good data show growth low grade glioma control chemotherapy radiation . However , low grade glioma child young adult grow despite treatment . Poly-ICLC new drug use safely child adult different type brain tumor . Earlier study show drug work well child young adult low grade gliomas child aggressive brain tumor . The main purpose study use Poly-ICLC treatment large number patient see well works many side effect occur . As Poly-ICLC FDA approve , study authorize use IND # 43984 , hold Oncovir . Subjects get injection Poly-ICLC muscle two time weekly . The first treatment give clinic allergic severe reaction , , monitor . If subject tolerate injection n't severe reaction , rest injection give home . Subjects/caregivers train give injection . Treatment last 2 year .

	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale The incidence primary pediatric brain tumor United States 1500 per year . Brain tumor common solid tumor diagnose childhood thus account significant childhood mortality United States . Low-grade astrocytomas glioma common type brain tumor childhood ( 36 % childhood brain tumor ) . These tumor encompass heterogeneous assortment histological subtypes include : fibrillary , protoplasmic , gemistocytic , mixed variant . Pilocytic astrocytomas , pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas subependymal giant cell astrocytomas also include . Furthermore , young child unique rare entity behave like low-grade tumor , include infantile desmoplastic gangliogliomas , desmoplastic astrocytomas . Although child low-grade astrocytomas often survive many year conventional treatment surgery sometimes radiotherapy , child fare well . These tumor constitute heterogeneous group differ location within brain vary biological behavior different subtypes . For total excision possible , cerebellar astrocytomas , prognosis excellent 90 % ten-year survival rate surgical excision alone . In contrast , survival rate child cerebral diencephalic tumor 40-70 % five year irradiation , decline 11-50 % 10 year ( Mundigers , 1990 ) . Some tumor however may unresectable/partially resectable , radiation undesirable side effect young child . While significant intellectual deficit occur young child le 5 year treat cranial irradiation , deficit recognize even young adult warrant extend age 10 year avoid radiation . Chemotherapy regimens use high-risk patient ( progressive tumor , residual tumor ) mean avoid delay radiation young patient , side effect chemotherapy frequently report . Newer form effective treatment less side effect much need childhood brain tumor especially low-grade glioma . We propose study efficacy toxicity poly-ICLC , biological response modifier child low-grade glioma . PROTEOMICS Current diagnostic therapeutic monitoring brain tumor patient significantly hinder due limited understanding brain tumor biology response therapy . The majority CNS tumor identify followed expression serum CSF marker . However , available , marker would highly desirable could use : - Detect minimal residual disease - Predict response specific target therapy - Predict anticipate tumor progression - Distinguish tumor recurrence post surgical change post-radiation change neuro-imaging - Augment current histopathologic classification system - Improve current clinical pathological treatment stratification schema - Assess efficacy tumor response specific biologic target therapy may impact tumor size primary tumor endpoint ( e.g. , small molecule inhibitor anti-angiogenic strategy ) While marker would useful prognosticate , monitor treat CNS tumor , use glial tumor include recurrent low grade astrocytomas critical since tumor often biopsied presentation , recurrence . Often tumors amenable complete resection biopsy due eloquence brain tissue infiltrate ( e.g. , optic pathway , brainstem hypothalamic glioma ) , blood vessel encase . CNS biologic material CSF Glial tumor tend disseminate locally along white matter tract rather sub-arachnoid seeding . Dissemination low grade glioma along sub-arachnoid space report child low grade glioma . Even focal tumor frequently adjacent CSF pathway ( e.g. , intrapeduncular fossa , third fourth ventricle ) result direct contact tumor tissue spinal fluid . Yet examination CSF cytology tumor standard . Given limitation identify tumor cell CSF , methodology could improve understand CNS tumor type need . This would provide significant improvement currently available knowledge biology tumor , could elucidate potential therapeutic avenue . Proteomics , relatively new area research whereby total protein complement tissue compartment analyze , successfully use identify novel biomarkers solid tumor ( Zheng , 2003 ) ; ( Khwaja , 2007 ) . Because proteins effector cellular function , measurement represent direct mean cellular characterization hence tumor biology . Because cell environment exist integrate state , possible interrogate protein extra-cellular compartment assess presence impact tumor cell . This do primarily use serum plasma establish method screen presence low stage tumor . An analogous extra-cellular compartment use brain tumor would cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . It circulate throughout CNS exchange proteins extra-cellular fluid brain spinal cord . CSF continuously create reabsorbed , provide real time steady state proteome . Unlike serum , contain highly complex protein mixture range low abundance proteins 10-30 pg/mL range abundant proteins 35-55 mg/mL range , CSF contain less complex protein mixture ( Omenn , 2005 ) . Therefore , CSF likely contain high relative concentration tumor-specific protein ( high signal noise ratio ) serum . Taken together make CSF attractive alternative serum detection brain tumor related biomarkers . Unlike leukemia many solid tumor outside CNS , serial biopsy readily perform , tumor CNS easily accessible time initial repeat resection biopsy . While study sample provide important finding regard tumor biology , serial analysis treatment reasonable . By contrast , CSF tumor patient readily sample pediatric patient . With development proteomic technology , investigation tumor relate signal time diagnosis treatment , remission and/or time recurrence progression possible . While CSF seed tumor readily available routinely obtain cytology , systematic evaluation protein within sample could considerable scientific importance . In addition identify potential maker disease response therapy , glycosylation phosphorylation status many protein also evaluate . Studies tumor tissue show information reveals activity different enzyme correlate treatment response ( Mellinghoff , 2005 ) ; ( Helgi , 2005 ) progression leptomeningeal metastasis ( Brandsma , 2006 ) . Proteomics CSF proteomics apply many neurological disorder include Alzheimer 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , multiple sclerosis , acute brain injury Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( Rohlff , 2001 ) . Reports use neuro-oncology limited , demonstrate potential technology effectively identify tumor biomarkers . One study use two dimensional polyacrylamide ( 2-D ) gel electrophoresis measure relative quantity two pre-selected marker , N-Myc l-CaD , CSF brain tumor patient ( Zheng , 2003 ) . Another used ELISA CSF identify Osteopontin predictive AT/RT correlate response therapy ( Kao , 2005 ) . CSF proteomics use 2-D gel electrophoresis combination mass spectroscopy cleavable isotope Coded Affinity Tag ( cICAT ) use evaluate 60 sample CSF tumor cyst fluid take adult brain tumor non-neoplastic control . These technique use find panel protein differentially express low vs. higher-grade glioma . Findings confirm use Western Blot analysis probe eight select protein base implied role gliomagenesis availability antibody . This report , accept publication pending revision , identify 21 potential CSF biomarkers astrocytoma . As mentioned , evidence glioma disseminate subarachnoid space . Currently several consortium actively study protein expression spinal fluid child malignant glial embryonal tumor ( Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium , Pediatric Oncology Experimental Therapeutics Consortium ) . Proteins interrogated protocol include involved angiogenesis neovascularity ( EGF , VEGF bFGF ) , involved tumor growth migration ( Secreted protein acidic cysteine rich domain ( SPARC ) , attractin ) . There consortium actively collect spinal fluid sample child low grade tumor . A secondary goal study examine protein CSF child low grade glioma tumor progression . Comparison CSF protein expression high grade low grade tumor likely help identify biological marker specific tumor progression , tumor pathology .</detailed_description>
