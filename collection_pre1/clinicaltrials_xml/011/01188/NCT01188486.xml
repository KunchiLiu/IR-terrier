	<brief_summary>Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) deadly cancer world . NSCLC annually cause 150,000 death US great 1 million worldwide . The standard treatment early stage NSCLC lobectomy lymphadenectomy . However , many patient poor operative candidate decline surgery . An emerge alternative Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) . Mounting evidence Phase I/II study demonstrate SBRT offer excellent local control . Most SBRT trial focus small , peripheral tumor inoperable patient . Increasingly , clinical trial study SBRT operable patient , often large , central tumor . Using clinical staging , significant proportion patient harbor occult nodal metastasis undergo SBRT primary tumor alone . Subgroups patient carry even high risk nodal metastasis . These nodal metastasis frequently would remove surgical intervention . However , SBRT , present , direct primary tumor , potentially leading regional failure otherwise curable patient . To increase effectiveness SBRT lung tumor , next logical step explore whether high risk area disease spread identify target . Regional failure could reduce outcome improved significant proportion patient treat SBRT primary nodal drainage ( PND ) identify , target treated addition primary tumor . We propose conduct study determine well water soluble iodinate contrast material inject directly tumor visualize CT scan integrate radiation therapy treatment planning .</brief_summary>
