	<brief_title>Postural Effects Being Rotated Whole Body Gyroscope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Computerized dynamic posturography ( CDP ) testing obtain practice session subject use CAPS Pro system ( Vestibular Technologies , Cheyenne WY , USA ) . All test conduct subject stand perturb foam cushion . Six different condition test sequence without subject step away foam/platform order ass center sway position change change test condition : ( 1 ) Eyes Open Head Neutral , ( 2 ) Eyes Closed Head Neutral , ( 3 ) Eyes Closed Head Right , ( 4 ) Eyes Closed Head Left , ( 5 ) Eyes Closed Head Flexed , ( 6 ) Eyes Closed Head Extended . Subjects continuously rotate computer-controlled multi-axis chair ( Gyrostim UltraThera Technologies , Inc. ) combination whole body Pitch Yaw simultaneously 40 second profile 90 deg/sec ( 15 RPM ) . The acceleration rate 90 degree per second well deceleration rate linear occur 1 second . We utilize rotation represent combination pitch yaw Pitch direction change two time Yaw direction four time ( Backward Pitch -20 second right Yaw-10 second leave Yaw-10 second , Forward Pitch- 20 second right Yaw-10 second leave Yaw 10 second ) . Post rotational CDP testing compare Pre Rotational CDP ,</detailed_description>
