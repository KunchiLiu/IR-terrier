	<brief_title>Transpulmonary Thermodilution Transesophageal Echocardiography Early Septic Shock</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient assess transpulmonary thermodilution technique TEE ( H0 ) . The two assessment perform random order ( central randomization stratify participate center ) , within 30 minute ( change ongoing treatment assessment period ) . Two investigator involve patient care blind result alternative technique perform independently hemodynamic assessment use one two modality hemodynamic assessment test study . They interpret result bedside propose therapeutic change attend physician , accord hemodynamic profile . The latter finally : precisely identify clinical problem solve ( e.g. , therapeutic target Surviving Sepsis Campaign reach , tissue hypoperfusion ) , choose therapy adapt take account clinical scenario result transpulmonary thermodilution TEE , evaluate efficacy treatment ( problem solve ) tolerance ( potential side-effect attributable treatment ) . In addition , presence resolution sign tissue hypoperfusion systematically assess H6 , H12 H24 . Primary secondary outcome assess independent committee expert .</detailed_description>
