	<brief_summary>This study test impact cognitive-behavioural self-management approach management insomnia among patient chronic pain . This self-management approach consist manual describe cognitive behavioural technique management insomnia . In term primary outcome , anticipate would improvements sleep-related dimension sleep quality , sleep efficiency , night-time awakening sample group receive copy self-help manual intervention implement participant home ( intervention group ) , relative group receive treatment usual ( control group ) . In term secondary outcome , anticipate intervention group show improvements mood , fatigue , pain severity , pain-related disability relative control group . The tertiary outcome variable pre-sleep arousal anticipate moderate mediate relationship sleep variable investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Cognitive-Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) Self-Management Approach Insomnia Chronic Pain : A Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In summary therefore , insomnia sleep difficulty report frequently occur conjunction medical psychiatric disorder , however insomnia co-occurring medical psychiatric condition receive less attention relative primary insomnia concurrent condition ( e.g. , Lichstein , 2006 ; McCrae , &amp; Lichstein , 2001 ; Taylor , Mallory , Lichstein , Durrence , Riedel , &amp; Bush , 2007 ) . In chronic pain , many well-controlled study involve insomnia exist concurrent chronically painful condition . Research thus far found multi-component cognitive-behavioural approach successful treat primary insomnia , study apply approach context insomnia concurrent medical condition ( Currie , Wilson , Pontefract , &amp; deLaplante , 2000 ; Morin , 1993 ) . Based Morin 's work ( Morin , 1993 ; Morin , Beaulieu-Bonneau , LeBlanc , &amp; Savard , 2005 ) involve cognitive-behaviour therapy ( CBT ) protocol patient sleep problem relate chronic pain , self-help format intervention also develop ( Currie &amp; Wilson , 1997 ) . However , thus far deliver within group-based treatment programme ( Currie , 1998 ; Currie &amp; Wilson , 1997 ; Currie , Wilson , Pontefract , &amp; deLaplante , 2000 ) . From context , build prior study involve group treatment format ( Currie , 1998 ; Currie , Wilson , Pontefract , &amp; deLaplante , 2000 ) , usefulness manualized self-management approach manage insomnia investigate , include impact approach regard salient measure improve functioning ( pain severity pain-related disability ) individual chronic pain . The propose study involve randomize control trial self-help treatment strategy comorbid insomnia chronically painful medical condition among adult outpatient sample hospital rehabilitation centre pain clinic . This study thus seek investigate successful cognitive-behaviour therapy ( CBT ) self-help management approach manage insomnia amongst people chronic pain . Given public health implication relationship poor sleep quality life ( e.g. , Morin , Stone , McDonald , &amp; Jones , 1994 ; Quesnel , Savard , Simard , Ivers , &amp; Morin , 2003 ) , self-management approach insomnia context chronic pain may offer accessible cost-effective treatment option . The following hypothesis test : The first hypothesis predict participant intervention group show change score psychological measure term great improvement sleep-related dimension , comparison control baseline post-treatment period . The second hypothesis predict participant intervention group show change score psychological measure term low level anxiety , depression , fatigue , pain severity , pain-related disability , comparison control baseline post-treatment period . These secondary outcome variable directly target intervention , however propose improvement sleep experience , would subsequent improvement variable mood , fatigue , pain severity , pain-related disability among chronic pain patient experience insomnia . The third hypothesis predict variable pre-sleep arousal moderate mediate influence sleep-related variable ( primary outcome variable ) . The moderate mediating variable pre-sleep arousal propose assess dimension related sleep tap primary outcome , sleep-related variable , may salience context insomnia comorbid chronically painful condition .</detailed_description>
