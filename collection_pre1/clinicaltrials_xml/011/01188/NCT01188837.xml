	<brief_summary>Common medical therapy knee osteoarthritis patient education , drug physical therapy , exercise surgery . These modality may offer improvement drug surgery carry significant risk . Manipulative therapy KOA give pain relief increase function . However , research suggest addition manipulative soft tissue therapy ( entire kinetic chain : lumbosacral , sacroiliac , hip , knee , ankle foot joint ) , may give good outcome . Exercise therapy consider effective standard care KOA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients seek treatment chiropractor osteoarthritis ( OA ) Knee OA ( KOA ) . Significant KOA impact 10 % individual age ≥63 particularly radiographic change ; age 65 , 80 % x-ray change . KOA may large cause decreased mobility , function , disability pain people age ≥ 50 US . KOA cause 30 % &gt; age 60 experience decrease social activity daily live , increase cardiovascular risk , increase fall risk secondary depression . Overall KOA prevalence 4 % young adult , 85 % &gt; 75 . Beyond great personal suffering - US , annual financial cost associate OA $ 60 billion per year 2000 , OA rheumatic disease $ 128 billion 2003 . Estimates 2005 27 million people suffer significantly due OA 2020 US develop nation &gt; 12 million suffer serious , 19 million minor moderate work activity relate disability OA KOA , high prevalence expect woman . Medical care commonly prescribe KOA lifestyle accommodation ( decreased activity , cane , high chair toilet seat , etc ) , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , anti-arthritics , steroid , various sundry prescription non-prescription oral topical medication exercise . Randomized control trial ( RCTS ) support exercise KOA treatment , proven superior placebo . At least 50 % ( periodically 90 percent ) KOA patient regularly use NSAIDs . Frequent minor intermittently serious gastrointestinal cardiovascular adverse reaction chronic use NSAIDS occur , evidence use exercise/rehabilitation without manipulative ( MAN ) therapy may give safer , similar equivalent relief . Supported earlier RCTs , MAN therapy without soft tissue exercise therapy KOA appear superior placebo equal superior exercise . Although Chiropractic conduct publish two RCTs manipulative therapy KOA , profession yet conduct RCT combine full kinetic chain MAN therapy , soft tissue rehabilitation versus standard care ( rehabilitation exercise therapy ) study optimum dose various patient . 1 ) . effect 1 study combine care ( MAN therapy , soft tissue rehabilitation exercise therapy ) exist ; 2 ) study MAN therapy combine rehabilitation need establish : ) . equivalent b ) . superior treatment efficacy full kinetic chain therapy c ) . use 'dose time response ' technique study optimum number treatment various patient ( help determine respond respond ) ) collect data develop future cost effective research . Significant morbidity occasional mortality NSAID drug-related complication surgery ; difficulty obtain compliance prolong exercise protocol ; apparent similar , equivalent superior outcome ( manipulative therapy without , possibly superior , combine rehabilitation ) pain relief , mobility function ; possibility decrease fall appal sequela morbidity , mortality expense ; justifies research multimodal manipulative therapy treatment KOA . Data suggest full kinetic chain MAN therapy rehabilitation may give early , effective , less costly outcome reflect common clinical chiropractic approach KOA . In addition knee joint , KOA disability demonstrate significantly worsen hip joint dysfunction , example restrict hip flexion increase KOA pain dysfunction ; similar association throughout full kinetic chain example lumbosacral spine joint dysfunction may increase knee pain dysfunction . Manipulative therapy apply appropriately full , kinetic chain ( full axial appendicular skeleton -the spine extremity ) combine rehabilitation may superior treatment knee OA .</detailed_description>
