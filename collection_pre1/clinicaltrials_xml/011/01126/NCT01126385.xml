	<detailed_description>Osteoporotic fragility fracture often occur spine . A common surgical technique transpedicular fixation use pedicle screw . A major complication treatment cut-out back-out screw due insufficient anchorage implant vertebral body . A new mechanical device develop order provide surgeon intraoperative information mechanical strength cancellous bone . In case low bone quality , treatment adapt patient 's condition , example augmentation screw anchorage use bone cement . However , treatment involves risk cement leakage subsequent pulmonary embolism nerve damage . Furthermore , cement augmentation time-consuming . Therefore , need diagnostic device intraoperatively support surgeon 's decision appropriate treatment . DensiProbe Spine develop accordingly clinically approve DensiProbe Hip , design diagnostic reason patient hip fracture undergoing fracture fixation dynamic hip screw ( DHS ) . However , application bone strength measurement spine far different hip anatomical dimension spine much small low value bone mineral density ( BMD ) bone strength expect . The objective pilot study investigate handle feasibility newly develop DensiProbe Spine measurement device . In case positive result pilot study , multicenter cohort study perform order clinically validate DensiProbe Spine device assess correlation DensiProbe Spine measurements amount pedicle screw migration patient undergo transpedicular fixation .</detailed_description>
