	<brief_summary>Allograft nephropathy common cause allograft failure follow kidney transplantation . Among putative etiology , cumulative exposure calcineurin inhibitor may one important progression factor . `` Spare Nephron '' ( STN ) unique study . Patients randomize either continue center-specific Calcinerium Inhibitor ( CNI ) therapy CNI replace sirolimus within first six month transplantation . Approximately 305 patient enrol study . More 230 patient finish 2 year follow-up . There well patient graft survival convert sirolimus . There also 10 % improvement kidney function convert . In cohort , wish explore durability improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Follow-up Spare Nephron ( STN ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In extension study extend clinical observation STN patient two five year . It expect Calcinerium Inhibitor ( CNI ) spar regimen associate good preservation kidney function few cardiovascular event . STN prospective multi-center study complete enrollment 305 first time recipient kidney allograft 27 center . The enrollee randomly assign either continue center-specific CNI regimen ( assigned time transplantation ) switch replace CNI sirolimus therapy . Either CNI sirolimus use combination CellCept therapy without use maintenance steroid , base individual center preference . Induction therapy also center-specific . In present long-term follow-up study approach patient previously enrol STN study offer opportunity enroll follow another 3 year . There change immunosuppression unless clinically indicate . The majority effort standard care every 6 month follow-up appointments.They require consented participate three year extension study . Research procedures : The inclusion criterion willingness sign consent form extension study , successful completion two year STN study . Study entry define point sign consent form , agree participate study extension.All patient follow 3 year initial screen visit . There 7 visit study period . All procedure standard care long-term transplant follow-up , change immunosuppression unless clinically indicate . The exception standard care obtain 24 hour urine protein creatinine clearance every 6 month follow-up . Visit 1 ( Study entry ) 1. Review inclusion/exclusion criterion 2 . Medical history , recipient 's age , gender race 3 . Complete transplant information i. date transplant ii . tissue ABO type iii . B-Cell cross match , PRA iv . Patient/donor EBV CMV serology The patient stay immunosuppression receive STN study , unless medication change due medical reason . They routinely monitor per center practice . The drug give standard care extension study alter participant ' medication regimen . The following laboratory evaluation typically perform visit . 1 . Tacrolimus / sirolimus trough concentration . Immunosuppressive regimen review change adjust necessary . 2 . CBC differential 3 . Chemistry panel : glucose , Na , K , Cl , CO2 , Ca , P , Mg , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , albumin total protein , AST , ALT , bilirubin ( total ) , alkaline phosphatase serum creatinine 4 Estimated GFR blood urine data . 5 . Fasting lipid profile : total cholesterol , LDL , HDL , HDL/LDL ratio , triglycerides The following clinical assessment also perform recorded visit : 1 . Vital sign 2 . Weight measurement 3 . Concomitant medication 4 . Adverse event 5 . Opportunistic infection 6 . Malignancies 7 . Clinical evaluation sign symptom rejection Number patient adverse event summarize body system adverse event . Incidence adverse event also summarize severity relationship study medication . Any serious adverse event death summarize separately . patient death , graft loss , need withdraw original assign calcineurin inhibitor therapy patient return dialysis 6 consecutive week , patient experience adverse event lead premature withdrawal loss follow-up . Patients follow end study case . All fail patient follow end last follow visit ( 36 month ) unless consent withdrawn . The proportion patient experience opportunistic infection summarize 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month randomization .</detailed_description>
