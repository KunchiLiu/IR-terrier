	<brief_summary>The prognosis heart failure patient bleak advanced stage disease , report 6-month mortality rate almost 50 % patient treat chronic inotropic therapy . As well severe prognosis , heart failure costly disease . Heart transplantation remain reference treatment terminal stage disease although effective therapy , engender ethical , social , economic legal problem . It also require irreproachable costly logistics , immuno-suppressor treatment lifetime follow-up . In particular , number donor go steadily several year country offer heart transplant programme patient take advantage add wait list graft ( age , co-morbidities… ) . It context , alongside medical treatment cardiac insufficiency , therapeutic strategy develop , include resynchronization long-term mechanical circulatory support . The progress make resynchronization several level : well understand action mechanism , development improvement equipment specifically dedicate resynchronization prospective randomize clinical trial scientifically validate technique . Simultaneously , many study publish evaluate long term support mechanical circulatory support ( MCS ) , exclude light device , bridge transplant alternative transplant . It also recognize mechanical circulatory support new generation continuous flow assist device improve quality life functional capacity , reduce risk device failure infrequent need replacement . The `` Achilles heel '' cardiac resynchronization remain 20 40 % patient respond barely . Among population patient , candidate transplantation long-term mechanical circulatory support axial pump alternative consider . We elaborate original randomize pilot study patient order evaluate survival quality life , define propose leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) .</brief_summary>
