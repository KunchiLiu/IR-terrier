	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate Brain MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) , Brain CT ( Computed Tomography ) Angiogram data subject participate `` Hyperbaric Oxygen Chronic Stable Brain Injury '' ( HYBOBI ) study . Including information MRI CT study provide information whether hyperbaric oxygen improve brain function subject brain injury . Subjects complete MR CT scan twice study . The first MR CT perform prior first hyperbaric session HYBOBI study , second perform within two week follow last hyperbaric session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Functional Anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Chronic Brain Injury Hyperbaric Oxygen ( HBO2 ) Study Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In ongoing feasibility study ( HYBOBI ) , brain-injured subject expose hyperbaric oxygen 1.5 atmospheres 60 minute . They receive exposure five day per week , receive 60 total session . Prior hyperbaric oxygen , study subject neurologic , cognitive , functional measure . The measure repeat conclusion 60 hyperbaric oxygen session , six month later . The goal HYBOBI feasibility study learn patient determine possible hyperbaric oxygen effect , , prepare blind randomize controlled clinical trial . This study add image component HYBOBI study , investigate brain change participant . Participants undergo Brain MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) use 3 tesla magnet , Brain CT ( Computed Tomography ) Angiogram . Subjects undergo image receive hyperbaric oxygen within 2 week completion 60 hyperbaric session .</detailed_description>
