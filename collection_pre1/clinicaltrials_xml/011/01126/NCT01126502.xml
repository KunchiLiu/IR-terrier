	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 17-DMAG patient relapsed CLL/SLL B-PLL . II . To define dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) 17-DMAG patient relapsed CLL/SLL B-PLL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary efficacy 17-DMAG patient relapse CLL/SLL B-PLL . II . To determine pharmacokinetics 17-DMAG patient relapse CLL/SLL B-PLL . III . To determine feasibility measure pharmacodynamic marker 17-DMAG include Hsp90 client protein Akt IKK-alpha/IKK-beta . IV . To determine FoxD3 downstream gene EPHA7 ID4 re-expressed CLL cell follow treatment 17-DMAG . V. To correlate pharmacokinetic feature 17-DMAG response , toxicity pharmacodynamic endpoint . VI . To correlate risk parameter ZAP-70 response 17-DMAG . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive alvespimycin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
