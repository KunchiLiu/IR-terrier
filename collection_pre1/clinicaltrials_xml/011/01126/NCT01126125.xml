	<brief_summary>In iodine-deficient country region inadequate iodize salt distribution , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend choose one two method improve iodine intake breastfeed infant : 1 ) iodine supplement ( 400 mg iodize oil ; 1/year ) breastfeeding mother , 2 ) iodine supplement ( 100 mg iodize oil ; 1/year ) directly infant . However , relative efficacy two method provide iodine newborn never directly compare . Whether first method iodine supplementation breast feed mother significantly improve iodine supply maintain normal thyroid function infant remain unclear . This study directly compare two strategy . The hypothesis two strategy equally effective provide iodine newborn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In iodine-deficient country region inadequate iodize salt distribution , WHO recommend choose one two method improve iodine intake breastfeed infant : Method 1 ) iodine supplement ( 400 mg iodize oil ; 1/year ) breastfeed mother Method 2 ) iodine supplement ( 100 mg iodize oil ; 1/year ) directly infant However , relative efficacy two method provide iodine newborn never directly compare . Whether first method iodine supplementation breast feed mother significantly improve iodine supply maintain normal thyroid function infant remain unclear . The mountain southern Morocco area iodine deficiency . Although government promote iodization salt , hundred small salt producer mountains fund infrastructure iodize salt , thus many rural population still consume non-iodized locally-produced salt . At study site , 2009 pilot survey urinary iodine find population region moderately iodine sufficient . Thus , accord WHO , breastfeed woman and/or infant provide oral iodine supplementation . But supplementation method preferable ? Controlled study clearly demonstrate iodine repletion moderate-to severely iodine deficient school-age child increase insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 insulin-like growth factor bind protein ( IGFBP ) -3 concentration improve somatic growth ( height weight ) . But whether supply adequate iodine iodine deficient infant improve somatic growth test . Therefore , study hypothesis : In Moroccan infant breastfeed , method 2 efficacious method 1 : 1. increase urinary iodine ( UI ) concentration 2. improve thyroid function ( TSH , TT4 ) 3. increase IGF-1 , IGFBP-3 4. improve somatic growth ( length , weight , head circumference ) The study design double-blind , randomize control intervention trial southern Morocco last 1 year . Healthy mother-infant pair ( n=240 ) breastfeeding recruit infant &gt; 1 mo age . They divide two group follow : 1 ) method 1 : mother receive 400 mg iodine oral iodize oil + infant receive placebo capsule ; 2 ) method 2 : mother receive placebo capsule + infant receive 100 mg oral iodize oil . The outcome : 1. length , weight , head circumference 2 . IGF-1 , IGFBP-3 , thyroid function ( TSH , total T4 ) dry blood spot take finger prick mothers/heel prick infant 3. urinary breast milk iodine concentration These sample ( blood spot , urine , breastmilk , anthropometry ) collect first year visit infant local health clinic routine pediatric vaccination ( 1 , 12 , 20 40-52 wks ) .</detailed_description>
