	<brief_summary>This study design prediction trial . That , primary purpose develop model apply clinically user-friendly `` baseline '' questionnaire capable predict `` success '' `` failure '' base patient 's pre-surgical expectation final outcome . In process , secondary goal develop outcomes measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trauma Expectation Factor Trauma Outcome Measure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : 1 . To develop novel , psychometrically sound , trauma patient expectation instrument : ) demonstrate content validity ; b ) consider patient surgeon expectation ; c ) predict orthopedic outcome ; ) reliable ; e ) patient friendly ; f ) easy score interpret . This know Trauma Expectation Factor ( TEF ) . 2 . To develop novel , psychometrically sound , trauma patient outcome instrument : ) demonstrate content validity ; b ) measure current condition domain expectation instrument ; c ) demonstrate construct validity ; ) demonstrate criterion validity ; e ) reliable ; f ) patient friendly ; g ) easy score interpret . This know Trauma Outcomes Measure ( TOM ) . Hypotheses : H # 1 . A simple pre-surgical questionnaire measure patient expectation ( i.e. , Trauma Expectation Factor ) ankle fracture require surgery predict `` expect '' score standardize disease-specific ankle instrument ( i.e. , AAOS Foot Ankle Core Score ) . H # 2 . A similar instrument reword assess current condition ( i.e. , Trauma Outcomes Measure ) instead expectation , valid , reliable , responsive measure traumatic patient 's condition . H # 3 . Patient surgeon expectation final outcome status different ; however , difference get small time .</detailed_description>
