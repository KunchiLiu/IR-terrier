	<detailed_description>Patients stratify treatment site ( Head Neck , Thorax , Abdomen , Pelvis , Extremities ) treatment volume ( low volume , high volume ) total 10 stratum . This study do two phase . In first phase , feasibility establish use primary objective set . The second phase begin early 90 day last patient initial phase complete treatment stratum feasibility verify . The secondary objective serve objective second phase study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients histologically confirm , nonCNS solid malignancy previously radiate tumor recurrence near prior radiation field . Rebiopsy recurrence require left discretion treat physician , although every effort make confirm recurrence . Patients must Karnofsky Performance Status 60 . Life expectancy 3 month .
