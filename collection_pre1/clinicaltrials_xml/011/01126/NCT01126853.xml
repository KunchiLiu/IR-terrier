	<brief_summary>Hepatitis B vaccine preventable infection transmit occupational exposure . Approximately 15 % patient respond initial series vaccination . Of re-vaccinated approximately fifty percent respond . On basis poor response third series , repeat vaccination recommend non-responders consider vulnerable infection . Cardell study use double dose combination hepatitis A B vaccine ( Twinrix ) non responder receive four dos previously find high response rate suggest vaccine dose could effective .

	<brief_title>Combination Hepatitis A B Vaccine Induce Immunity Non-responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B blood borne infection highly transmissible occupational exposure healthcare . The maximal risk transmission occur needle-stick injury . However , majority case transmission probably occur low risk exposure . Overall , risk transmission hepatitis B infect patient susceptible health care worker estimate 23-62 % single parenteral exposure ( US PHS 2001 ) . Acute hepatitis B symptomatic approximately 30 % case , 0.1-0.5 % case develop fulminant hepatitis risk death . Another 5 % case go chronic hepatitis B infection associate risk cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . This transmission prevent vaccination health care worker prior exposure . Successful vaccination provide year protection ( Alavian 2008 ) Consequently , US CDC Canadian National Advisory Committee immunization recommend vaccination heath care worker contact blood , bodily fluid , sharp . A test immunity perform completion vaccination , ~15 % healthy adult respond primary vaccine series . For health care worker immune first series , second immunization attempt make . The expected rate response group 30-50 % ( US PHS 2001 ) .Those fail develop protective antibody response ( anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody titre &gt; =10mIU/ml ) , label non-responders consider susceptible infection . A third attempt vaccination currently recommend estimate rate response 10 % . When susceptible , vaccine non-responding health care worker occupational exposure hepatitis B , CDC recommend treatment two dos hepatitis B immune globulin , blood product undefined risk transmit yet unknown blood borne infection . A recent study Cardell ( 2008 ) look vaccine response three dose double-dose Twinrix® patient fail least 4 dos hepatitis B vaccine . The response rate 44 health care worker fail 4 dos 95 % . This much high documented 30-50 % response rate quote CDC . The important distinction Cardell et al , study , entry criterion stringent , represent point know recommend `` non-responder '' physician healthcare worker . The current recommended standard provide two full series vaccine conclude person non-responder . Cardell others ( Wismans , 1988 ; Craven , 1986 ; Westmoreland , 1990 ) , include patient respond single series vaccination , also receive full second series , potentially over-estimate efficacy regime , thus n't provide u guidance true non-responder subgroup . The importance complete two full series immunization ( 6 total dos ) highlight Clemens ( 1997 ) demonstrate significant increase proportion responder last 2 dos vaccine second series . The Cochrane meta-analysis hepatitis B vaccination health care worker suggest currently insufficient evidence insofar treatment non-responders ( Chen , 2005 ) . Our study may provide information profoundly positive . More likely , serve support large study could provide meaningful guidance management health care worker truly fail two full series immunization attempt , currently would label susceptible . This population represent significant minority healthcare worker ( ~5 % ) , remain risk life-threatening occupational disease despite vaccination . Other mechanisms immunization attempt non-responder group include booster dos ( Das , 2003 ) , intradermal administration ( Yasumura , 1991 ) , adjuvant interferon ( Goldwater , 1994 ) , new formulations/designs vaccine triple-valent vaccine ( Zuckerman , 2001 ; Rendi-Wagner , 2006 ) , vaccine adjuvant ( Jacques , 2002 ) , particle base DNA vaccine ( Rottinghaus , 2003 ) . These show demonstrable effect , study include subject respond single series immunization , , Cardell et al , none result response majority non-responders . Our study utilize currently license vaccine , dos demonstrate safe , Cardell 's evidence support hypothesis may highly effective . The use high dose recombinant vaccine show demonstrable effect dos ( Goldwater , Randomized , comparative trial 20 microgram vs 40 microgram Engerix B vaccine hepatitis B vaccine non-responders. , 1997 ) . However , evidence combination A/B vaccine may produce immunogenicity hepatitis A B response ( Czeschinski , 2000 ) . Thus , study test new strategy vaccination group select at-risk healthcare worker currently recommend vaccination strategy . The potential impact study considerable . Our study expand Cardell 's look specifically fail two complete series vaccination ( 6 dos ) would otherwise labelled non-responders accord CDC criterion . Our hypothesis combine hepatitis A B vaccine ( Twinrix® ) give double-dose Cardell 's study induce protective immunity non-responders rate much high traditionally quote 10 % response rate .</detailed_description>
