	<brief_summary>The purpose study check accuracy procedure call exhale carbon monoxide ( eCO ) testing . Exhaled carbon monoxide use physician help assess breathe people condition like asthma emphysema . eCO may use correct another breathe test ( call diffusing capacity , DLCO ) . Blood collection usually require correct DLCO , validation eCO test may help avoid blood collection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study check accuracy procedure call exhale carbon monoxide ( eCO ) testing . Exhaled carbon monoxide use physician help assess breathe people condition like asthma emphysema . 100 subject least 18 year age invite participate . The first 50 subject ( Part 1 ) must pulmonary function test ( spirometry , diffuse capacity CO-oximetry ) clinical reason order physician order enroll . The second 50 subject ( Part 2 ) may undergo test part study . Participation require 1 visit , subject undergo breathing test , blood collect , answer 3 question . The number breathing test depend part study subject . Subjects participate Part 1 study undergo 2-4 additional diffusing capacity ( breathe ) test . ( Clinical test require 2-4 test . This study require 6 . The number research test do depend number clinical test do . Subjects participate Part 2 study clinical breathing test order physician undergo 1 spirometry ( breathe ) test ( 3-8 blow tube ) , 6 diffusing capacity ( breathe test ) , blood draw . All subject undergo eCO testing ( blow machine ) breathing test breathe test . The visit Part 1 study take 30 minute . The visit Part 2 study take 30 minute subject undergone clinical breathing test recently , 1 Â½ hour must undergo breathe test research . Subjects also pulse oximetry ( use standard finger clip ) perform time eCO testing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients minimum spirometry , diffuse capacity COoximetry perform clinical indication ( Part 1 ) Willingness go study procedure . Ability give write informed consent participate study . Subjects oxygen therapy within 1 hour . High level oxygen use displace CO case toxicity . Presumably recently low flow oxygen steady state several halflives . Selfreported smoking within 1hour . Significant exercise within 15 minute Recent ( within 2 hr ) alcohol consumption ( alcohol interfere DLCO measurement ) Subjects unwilling remove nail polish one finger Known atypical hemoglobin type ( e.g . sickle cell trait disease , thalassemia etc ) . The binding release oxygen presumably CO alter type hemoglobinopathy History know suspect alveolar hemorrhage . Free hemoglobin red cell alveolus markedly raise DLCO theoretically might alter eCO . Known suspected intestinal bacterial overgrowth . Although cross reactivity CO sensor hydrogen &lt; 2 % , high value hydrogen bacterial overgrowth , may lead erroneous CO measurement . Tracheostomy inability form tight seal around mouthpiece . Prior participation part study ( i.e. , subject participate Part 1 Part 2 , twice Part 1 , twice Part 2 ) Inability perform spirometry diffuse capacity Inability consent Other disease condition may , opinion investigator , result invalid pulmonary function test eCO measurement .</criteria>
