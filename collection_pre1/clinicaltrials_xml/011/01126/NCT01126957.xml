	<detailed_description>Introduction Numerous drug combination drug use procedural sedation analgesia ( PSA ) Emergency Departments , include propofol , ketamine , benzodiazepine , narcotic , barbiturate , others , propofol gain popularity despite potential cause cardiac respiratory depression . Obviously optimal agent combination agent identify . There reason believe combination ketamine propofol may advantage agents/combinations . These include good hemodynamic stability equal depth anesthesia combination ketamine/propofol propofol alone , less respiratory depression combination comparison propofol alone , preservation respiratory drive combination . There one study ketamine/propofol Emergency Department ( ED ) procedural sedation demonstrate safety effectiveness combination , compare agent combination . We design randomize , placebo control study compare propofol propofol ketamine adequacy sedation respiratory depression Emergency Department procedural sedation analgesia . Our hypothesis combination propofol/ketamine would produce good sedation and/or less respiratory depression propofol alone . Methods Study design We conduct randomize , prospective , double-blinded study patient receive procedural sedation . From May 2007 March 2009 ED 274 bed university teach hospital . The study approve University Missouri 's Institutional Review Board inform consent obtain participant . Study set population All patient require PSA ED view potential subject unless pregnant , less 1 year age , history prior adverse reaction anesthesia , underlie cardiac pulmonary disease , hepatic dysfunction , porphyria , psychiatric illness , allergy eggs/soybeans , increase intracranial intraocular pressure , abnormal airway pathology American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) score 3 great . The attend ED physician would approach patient enroll study . If patient accept randomized hospital pharmacy . Study protocol An ED attend physician dedicate PSA throughout procedure . Patients EKG , blood pressure , respiratory rate , pulse oximetry , end-tidal carbon dioxide ( PetCO2 ) monitor , IV access obtain place nasal cannula oxygen supplementation . All patient receive pre-procedure analgesia 0.5 1.5 mcg/Kg fentanyl patient reflective sunglass place obscure eye movement staff . Subjects randomize pharmacy block ten . Consecutively numbered pre-filled 3cc syrinx prepared pharmacy staff receive sign date study enrollment sheet ER staff patient weight kilogram provide . All physician , nurse , patient study personnel blind content syrinx hand deliver pharmacy personnel . Patients randomize receive either 0.5 mg/Kg ketamine placebo ( normal saline ) deliver emergency room sedate physician 3 cc syringe contain clear/colorless solution . This solution deliver intravenously one minute infusion . On completion infusion patient receive propofol start 1 mg/Kg 2 minute supplement repeated bolus 0.5 mg/Kg maintain adequate sedation . Patients felt adequately sedate receive Colorado Behavioral Numerical Pain Scale ( CBNPS ) score 0 113 ( table 1 . ) Patients monitored procedure normal level consciousness observe . The quantity drug deliver record . During procedure patient monitor 5 respiratory depression marker : - PetCO2 rise ³ 5 mm/Hg - Respiratory rate &lt; 8 br/min - arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO2 ) &lt; 90 % - Apnea ³ 15 second - Airway manipulation Physicians permit intervene provide supportive/resuscitative measure discretion despite pre-specified respiratory depression marker . All data collect record standardized Hospital PSA form . Data collect entire time frame individual procedural sedation . Following completion procedural sedation second form fill sedate physician monitoring nurse record specifically respiratory events/rescue intervention overall satisfaction procedural sedation . The overall quality PSA evaluate physician/nurse perform sedation one following : 1 . Not satisfied 2 . Somewhat satisfy 3 . Satisfied 4 . Very satisfied 5 . Excellent All data record secure computer spreadsheet form ( Microsoft Excel 2003 , Microsoft Corporation , Redmond , WA ) later analysis . Outcome Measures Four endpoint define prior study initiation : Respiratory Depression . A difference evidence respiratory depression group . Respiratory depression define occurrence 5 marker . Satisfaction PSA . A difference evaluation quality sedation provider . Quality PSA . Number patient CBNPS 0 . Propofol usage . Did addition ketamine significantly reduce amount propofol need produce adequate PSA . Data analysis We plan enroll 100 patient group . This base estimate 40 % incidence respiratory depression propofol alone , reduction 20 % combination ketamine/propofol , 0.05 power 0.8.14-16 . An interim analysis conduct enrollment 100 patient use significance 0.025 difference respiratory depression . Respiratory depression CBNPS compare use chi-squared test Satisfaction PSA Quality PSA compare use t-test . Tests do Primer Biostatistics ( Version 6.0 , Stanton A.
