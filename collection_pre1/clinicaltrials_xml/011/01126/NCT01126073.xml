	<detailed_description>Endothelial dysfunction regard syndrome exhibit systemic manifestation detectable prior obvious intimal lesion consider important factor pathogenesis atherosclerosis complication . Endothelial function determine integrated index atherogenic atheroprotective factor present individual , include know , well yet unknown variable genetic predisposition . Should hypothesis endothelial dysfunction reflect vascular phenotype prone atherogenesis true , endothelial function could serve marker inherent atherosclerotic risk . Dysfunction either coronary peripheral vascular endothelium consider independent predictor cardiovascular event , offer valuable prognostic information additional derive conventional risk factor assessment . Interventions , risk factor modification treatment various drug , include statin angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor , show improve endothelial function . Endothelial dependant vasomotion use clinical endpoint assessment endothelial function . Testing involve pharmacological and/or physiological stimulation endothelial release NO vasoactive compound , often comparison vascular response endothelium-independent dilator nitroglycerine . Determination local NO bioavailability reflect influence vascular tone , also important function molecule , include thromboregulation , cell adhesion , proliferation A non-invasive technique develop evaluate endothelium-dependent , brachial artery FMD . Endothelium brachial artery provoke release nitric oxide ( NO ) pressure create inflated sphygmomanometer cuff place forearm distal brachial artery subsequent release 4-5 minute later.FMD occur predominantly result local endothelial release NO image quantitated index vasomotor function . The advantage high-frequency ultrasonographic image brachial artery two-fold : non-invasive allows repeat measurement . Large prospective epidemiological study demonstrate inverse correlation high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) risk cardiovascular event . Although atheroprotective effect HDL mainly attribute function reverse cholesterol transport , lately numerous beneficial effect HDL improvement endothelial function , anti-inflammatory , anti-thrombotic , antioxidative effect stimulation endothelial regeneration identify . Consequently , therapeutic elevation HDL become important goal treatment patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Warnholtz et al recently demonstrate extended-release ( ER ) niacin 1000 mg daily significantly improve endothelial function CAD patient low HDL-C , normal HDL-C . The big obstacle niacin therapy flush make many patient non compliant prescribe medication . Tredaptive TM [ ( ERN/LRPT ) ; Merck &amp; Co. , Inc , Whitehouse Station , NJ , USA ) ] combination tablet contain 1 g extend release niacin ( ERN ) 20 mg laropiprant , highly selective PGD2-receptor ( DP1 ) antagonist , offer improved tolerability , support simplify 1-2 g dose paradigm improve compliance . Statins niacin show improve endothelial function CAD patient , however , question whether niacin improves endothelial function statin treat patient still remain open . What would time need show effect also know , base recent publication Warholtz seem 12 week sufficient . This study would prospectively test influence high dose ER-niacin ( 2000mg ) use late publication ( 1000 mg ) addition laropiprant ( 40mg ) CHD patient low HDL-C , subgroup recent publication Warhnoltz seem benefit treatment niacin .</detailed_description>
