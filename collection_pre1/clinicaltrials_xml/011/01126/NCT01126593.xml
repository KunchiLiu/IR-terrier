	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blinded placebo control study . Randomization perform random number table . Envelopes seal accompany randomization group.Patients eligible inclusion study full-thickness rotator cuff tear deem reparable preoperative MRI . They include study medically stable undergo surgery consent involvement study . Patients consent study undergo arthroscopic rotator cuff repair one two senior author . The surgery perform outpatient procedure general anesthesia . The procedure perform utilizing standard technique senior author . All concomitant pathology find time arthroscopy treat usual appropriate fashion . At completion rotator cuff repair , patient randomly allocate one three group . This do opening seal envelope randomization allocation . The patient either place study group , placebo group control group .</detailed_description>
