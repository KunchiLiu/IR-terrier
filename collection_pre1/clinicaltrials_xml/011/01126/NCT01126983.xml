	<brief_title>Lead Migration Spinal Cord Stimulation Trials : Comparing Non-suture v Suture Lead Anchor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lead migration know issue/complication spinal cord stimulation . Lead migration trial period alter success trial . There one way secure lead skin . Our endeavor look different mode secure lead skin trial period present respective lead migration rate . The three method 1. suture lead use 2.0 mono-filament nylon skin , 2. suture ( 2.0 mono-filament nylon ) lead anchor ( St.Jude Med Co. long , model # 1106 ) attach skin , 3. non- suture . In three group copious amount benzoin steri-strips use . Fluoroscopy picture take lead insert level lead mark . After trial period , lead remove , AP/lateral plain X-ray take compare fluoroscopy picture take time lead placement .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All patient undergoing Spinal Cord Stimulation ( age &gt; 18yrs ) patient whose trial period last less 3 day 5 day exclude study . patient may require revision lead complication require take lead end trial period .</criteria>
