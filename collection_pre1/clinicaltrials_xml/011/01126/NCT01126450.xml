	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lenalidomide may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving lenalidomide together cetuximab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together cetuximab treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore safety efficacy profile . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-28 cetuximab IV weekly 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
