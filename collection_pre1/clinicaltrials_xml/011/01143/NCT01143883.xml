	<brief_summary>This clinical study prospective , randomize , control trial patient undergo elective colorectal surgical procedure receive abdominal skin incision least 6 cm . Treatment Silverlon® compare standard postoperative dressing 4x4 Gauze paper tape . Patients randomize 1:1 treatment allocation ratio receive either 1 ) Silverlon® 2 ) standard postsurgical dressing . Neither Investigators participant blind treatment modality randomization . Silver long know antimicrobial property . It interact structural protein DNA , inhibit bacterial replication cause fatal structural change within cell wall . It broad antimicrobial activity unlike antibiotic , rarely associate microbial resistance . Silverlon® silver-nylon dressing specifically design surgical wound prevent development surgical site infection . It easy use product know microbial resistance adverse effect . The efficacy Silverlon® prevent surgical site infection show several retrospective study yet test prospective fashion . The objective study perform prospective , randomize , clinical trial directly compare incidence surgical site infection patient treat Silverlon® standard postoperative dressing follow elective colorectal surgery</brief_summary>
