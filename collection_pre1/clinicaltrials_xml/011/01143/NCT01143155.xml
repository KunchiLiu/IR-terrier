	<brief_summary>Although failure mortality relevant outcomes patient Community-acquired Pneumonia ( CAP ) , little discussion literature incidence etiology . A pathophysiological approach recently develop used evaluate clinical failure CAP patient . Clinical failure analyze related versus unrelated CAP , consider role pulmonary infection inflammatory response play development outcome . Cardiac event identify trigger clinical failure significant percentage CAP patient . The development cardiovascular event also identify CAP patient admission hospital hospitalization . However , data topic belong study evaluate select population veteran patient CAP . Understanding clinical failure , well cardiovascular event hospitalize patient CAP would useful order prevent complication hospitalization , develop new treatment modality , thus , improve outcome . The objective international , multicenter , observational , prospective cohort study : 1 ) To define incidence , timing , etiology risk factor clinical failure , relate vs. unrelated CAP , hospitalize patient CAP ; 2 ) To define incidence , timing , risk factor cardiovascular event either hospital admission hospitalization hospitalize patient CAP.Consecutive adult patient hospitalized CAP acute care hospital Europe US enrol . Daily clinical evaluation . Demographics , history , clinical , radiological , antibiotic therapy data record , well serum , urinary respiratory sample collect admission hospitalization consent individual . Patients classify CAP-related versus CAP-unrelated failure , accord pathophysiological classification . Patients also classify cardiovascular event either admission hospitalization.The follow outcome measure : 1 ) Incidence , timing , etiology risk factor clinical failure relate vs. unrelated CAP ; 2 ) Incidence , time risk factor cardiovascular event ; 3 ) time clinical stability , length hospital stay , mortality hospital discharge , mortality 30 180 day .</brief_summary>

Patients meet least one follow definition exclude analysis : 1 . Patient hospitalacquired pneumonia , define pneumonia develop 48 hour current hospitalization , pneumonia develops patient discharge hospital within prior 14 day current hospitalization . 2 . Patient readmitted new episode pneumonia 14day follow period previous hospitalization . 3 . Unstable psychiatric psychological condition render subject unlikely cooperative complete study requirement . 4 . Subject history investigator 's opinion would preclude subject compliance protocol .</criteria>
