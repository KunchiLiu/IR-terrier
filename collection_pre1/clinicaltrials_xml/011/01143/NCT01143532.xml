	<brief_summary>Background : - Genetic variation particular chromosome major contributor increase risk kidney disease common people African descent , although specific gene , mutation , aspect variation remain determined . By study outcome kidney transplant donor recipient African descent , researcher hope good understand effect genetic variation success kidney transplant . Objectives : - To examine possible connection genetic variation kidney transplant outcomes donor recipient . Eligibility : - &lt; TAB &gt; Participants kidney transplant donor recipient black African descent . - &lt; TAB &gt; Eligible transplant include live donor decease donor . Design : - The study involve one visit 8 hour . - All participant provide detailed personal family medical history . - All participant provide blood urine sample , include 24-hour urine collection , test kidney function collect material genetic testing . - Donor participant also magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan remain kidney .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic variation region MYH9 APOL1 , locate chromosome 22 , major contributor increase risk kidney disease characterize African descent population , although specific gene , causative mutation , molecular cellular mechanism remain determined . We propose study role MYH9 APOL1 genetic variation , well gene , renal transplant , include effect donor genotype recipient outcome donor outcomes . Additional exploratory study address 1 ) whether variation donor gene might contribute donor recipient outcome , may address candidate gene study genome-wide association study 2 ) whether recipient genotype contribute recipient outcome , address similar way . MULTICENTER STUDY . We identify 300 kidney transplant dyad ( donor/recipient pair ) , individual African descent kidney transplant perform 1995 2006 . We include 150 live donor transplant ( select basis ability locate survive live donor willingness participate ) 150 decease donor transplant ( select random , minimize survival bias allograft ) . All subject sign consent identical similar NIH consent . RECIPIENT OUTCOMES . We hypothesize genetic variant kidney donor genome secondarily recipient genome might contribute kidney recipient outcomes . We obtain kidney donor genotype use blood survive living donor use transplant kidney biopsy DNA now-deceased living donor , obtain deceased donor genotype use transplant kidney biopsy . We obtain recipient DNA , available , survive recipient tissue obtain deceased recipient . We carry Cox proportional hazard analysis test primary hypothesis , donor MYH9 APOL1 genotype influence allograft survival . We also develop multivariable model predict last follow-up glomerular filtration rate , incorporate factor know influence transplant outcomes examine effect donor MYH9 APOL1 genotype . In exploratory study , determine whether recipient genetic variant influence recipient outcomes . DONOR OUTCOMES . We hypothesize genetic variant kidney donor affect kidney donor outcome . While kidney donor increase risk chronic kidney disease compare general population , increase prevalence microalbuminuria . Furthermore , extent compensatory renal hypertrophy appear differ among individual . We wish determine whether MYH9 APOL1 genotype affect outcomes , well uncommon occurrence overt kidney disease kidney donation . CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS . We believe study expand knowledge donor genotype influence kidney transplant outcomes donor recipient . COLLABORATIVE STUDY . In separate related study , work various collaborator pursue similar question research protocol generate local IRB approval . We receive collaborator material preparation DNA , genotype APOL1 gene know hypothesized related donor recipient transplant outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We study 300 African American kidney transplant dyad . INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR DYADS : 1 . African descent donor African descent recipient 2 . Kidney transplant perform Jan 1995 Dec 2006 . 3 . First kidney transplant 4 . Kidney transplant ( exclude transplant organ time ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . We exclude donor whose kidney use transplant two organ transplant , e.g . pancreas kidney , either simultaneously separate time . We exclude donor whose kidney use second subsequent transplant . Rationale : dual organ transplant serial transplant complicate clinical situation renal allograft survival may shorter thus comparable kidney transplant . 2 . We exclude recipient HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C infection diagnose either kidney transplant . 3 . Children 4 . Pregnant woman exclude invited participate delivery . The rationale renal function alter pregnancy</criteria>
