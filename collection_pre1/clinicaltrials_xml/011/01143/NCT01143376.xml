	<brief_summary>The appropriate effective exercise intervention weight loss remain matter continue discussion need identify sustainable exercise program successfully promote weight loss benefit health . The primary objective study determine high-intensity intermittent sprinting ( HIIS ) produce good result term reduce metabolic cardiovascular risk factor , special emphasis fat mass loss insulin sensitivity `` healthy '' obese volunteer compare iso-caloric program moderate-intensity continuous cycling ( MICC ) ( control condition follow international recommendation ) . We also assess impact short duration sprint ( SDS ) factor understand potential mechanism behind different outcome among train program . The overall hypothesis HIIS lead great reduction metabolic cardiovascular risk factor compare MICC healthy obese volunteer SDS produce similar improvement cardiovascular risk factor long duration HIIS</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-intensity Intermittent Training Obese Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomize one three group : HIIS ( 8 sprint:12s rest ) MICC ( control group ) iso-caloric protocol ( duration need induce 250 kcal energy deficit ) SDS ( 8 sprint:12s rest ) 10 minute 12 week . The intervention group match age , BMI male/females ratio participant ask change normal diet throughout study . Before exercise intervention ( 12 week ) , participant perform follow assessment : 1 . Three-day food diary 2 . Anthropometric measurement ( weight , height , waist hip ) use standard procedure ; 3 . Body composition use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) 4 . RMR rest respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) use indirect calorimetry ; 5 . Endothelial function assess flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) brachial artery use vascular ultrasound accord current guideline ; 6 . Maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) fat oxidation , cardiac output leave ventricular function exercise use cycle ergometer ; 7 . Muscle fat biopsy 8 . Fasting postprandial release appetite relate hormone ( subjective feeling hunger/fullness use visual analogue scale - VAS ) .</detailed_description>
