	<brief_summary>The long-term goal project develop rehabilitation strategy facilitate optimal restoration skilled hand use individual spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The objective study propose application determine whether protocol mass practice + somatosensory stimulation ( MP+SS ) effective improve skilled hand use compare somatosensory stimulation ( SS ) alone , determine whether approach effective traditional therapy ( consist conventional resistance training ; CRT ) . Specific Aim I : In individual chronic incomplete tetraplegia , quantify change skilled hand use sensory function associate either : massed practice training combine somatosensory stimulation ( MP+SS ) , somatosensory stimulation ( SS ) , control ( conventional resistance training [ CRT ] ) , compare difference among group . The investigator hypothesize : H1.1 : At end 4 week , gain score standardize test skilled hand motor function ( Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test Chedoke-McMaster Arm Hand Activity Inventory ) sensory function ( quantitative sensory test ; QST ) great individual train use MP+SS compare SS RT group . H1.2 : At end 4 week , gain score standardize test skilled hand motor function sensory function test great individual train use SS compare CRT . H1.3 : At 6 month post training , motor sensory gain retain MP+SS SS group . Specific Aim 2 : In individual chronic incomplete tetraplegia , quantify change cortical spinal neurophysiology associate either : massed practice combine somatosensory stimulation ( MP+SS ) , somatosensory stimulation ( SS ) , control ( conventional resistance training [ CRT ] ) , compare difference among group . The investigator hypothesize , 4 week : H2.1 : Measures represent cortical neurophysiologic function ( i.e. , motor-evoked potential amplitude location cortical map ) show great change direction normal value individual train use MP+SS compare SS CRT group . H2.2 : Measures represent spinal neurophysiologic function ( i.e. , F-wave H-reflex amplitude ) show great change direction normal value individual train use SS compare MP+SS CRT group . H2.3 : There positive relationship change score associate functional outcome measure cortical neurophysiologic outcome measure MP+SS group ; positive relationship change score associate functional outcome measure spinal neurophysiologic outcome measure SS group . Specific Aim 3 : In individual chronic incomplete tetraplegia , quantify change self-assessment quality life societal participation associate massed practice combine somatosensory stimulation ( MP+SS ) , somatosensory stimulation ( SS ) control ( conventional resistance training [ CRT ] ) , compare difference among group . The investigator hypothesize : H3.1 : Gains score standardize measure quality life ( Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 [ SF-36 ] ) societal participation ( Impact Participation Autonomy Questionnaire [ IPAQ ] ) great individual train use MP+SS compare SS CRT group . H3.2 : Gains score standardize measure quality life societal participation great individual train use SS compare CRT group . H3.3 : At 6 month post training , gain quality life societal participation measure retain MP+SS SS group . Risks : This low risk study investigate effect standard rehabilitation exercise intervention hand/arm function individual SCI . All device consider minimal risk device FDA .</brief_summary>
