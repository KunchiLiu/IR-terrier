	<brief_summary>Several study show high intensity intermittent sprint ( HIIS ) effective moderate intensity continuous cycling ( MICC ) reduce fat mass improve insulin resistance normal weight individual . Changes appetite-regulatory system response exercise likely explain , least partially , good outcome observe HIIS . Unfortunately , study compare impact different type acute aerobic exercise release appetite-regulating hormone , subjective feeling appetite subsequent energy intake ( EI ) . The primary objective study investigate effect acute isocaloric bout HIIT MICC short duration sprint , comparison rest control condition , postprandial release appetite-regulating hormone , subjective feeling appetite subsequent EI obese individual . The investigator hypothesize isocaloric session HIIS result well short-term appetite control compare MICC , reduce hunger feeling subsequent food intake MICC inducing large increase release satiety gut peptide compare MICC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise cross-over study four leg . Participants act control assign four experimental condition ( rest , HIIS , MICC SDS ) , 1 week apart , counter-balanced order . Participants ask come Unit five time : one preliminary session four experimental condition ( rest , HIIS MICC isocaloric session SDS ) . In preliminary session , anthropometric data ( weight height ) collect maximal fitness test perform , use cycle ergometer . For four experimental condition , participant ask arrive approximately 8.00 , fast least 10 hour , cannula insert antecubital vein . Two fast blood sample take standard breakfast offer . After , serial blood sample take regular interval period 3h . Participants ask rate subjective feeling hunger fullness use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) throughout study morning different time point . Three hour breakfast , participant place individual room , present standardized lunch instruct rate taste palatability food present .</detailed_description>
