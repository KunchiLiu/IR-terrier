	<brief_summary>Surveillance lung bacteria routinely undertaken artificially ventilated patient individual high risk develop pneumonia . Knowledge type bacteria present allows rapid treatment correct antibiotic pneumonia develops . Surveillance undertaken use technique call non-directed bronchoalveolar lavage ( NBL ) , perform bedside nurse . This involve suction lung secretion sample pot send microbiology laboratory identify bacteria present . When procedure perform collapse lung due escape gas . The purpose study : 1 . To use non-invasive imaging technique know electrical impedance tomography ( EIT ) measure amount lung collapse NBL . Half patient study one-way adapter valve connect breathe circuit . This adapter design make insertion suction catheter easier prevent loss gas . 2 . Look region lung sample collect suction tube use take sample may pass either leave right lung . EIT simple non-invasive technique use many year . It use pair electrode around chest imperceptible current pass . A computer show image part lung least air . This advantage image technique critical care use radiation give real time picture bedside variation ventilation throughout lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bedside Measurement Ventilation With Without One-way Valve During Lung Lavage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study two objective . The first measure change lung ventilation use EIT performance NBL without one-way adapter valve attach catheter mount . This do randomising half patient one-way adapter valve attach catheter mount . Assignment randomisation . The second objective study locate placement catheter tip performance NBLs , use electrical impedance tomography . Equipment : A sixteen-electrode single frequency electrical impedance tomography device on-line image analysis ( CareFusion ) . One-way adapter valve attach catheter mount ( CareFusion ) . Study Population : Critically ill adult patient admit intensive care unit University Hospital Wales Cardiff NBLs perform part routine care . Recruitment : All patient satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion , admit adult ICU University Hospital Wales start date study consider eligible recruitment . Patients identify duty consultant notify research team . Patients randomly allocate NBLs perform without one-way valve attach catheter mount . Since observational pilot study minimum fifty patient identify . Interventions : The second cohort patient NBLs perform one-way adapter connected catheter mount , otherwise change make normal standard care . Method : Following clean skin alcohol wipe sixteen ECG electrode place equidistantly one another midway sternum umbilicus . A reference electrode place right hand side chest . NBLs undertaken accord routine standard care . In brief , involve pre-oxygenating patient , insert suction catheter attach 20ml saline fill syringe catheter mount ( 25 patient ) adapter one-way valve connect catheter mount ( 25 patient ) resistance meet . The saline instill slowly withdraw obtain sample . Since saline conductive , instillation result change local impedance detect array electrode . The image obtain identify region lung catheter place . Any change gas content lung ( due loss PEEP ) manifest change lung impedance reflect change regional ventilation . NBLs undertaken clinically indicated patient may one recode undertaken maximum three time . Collection data : Baseline demographic patient record , include age , sex , APACHE II score , co-morbidities , diagnosis , day hospital admission . Ventilator settings - mode , inspire oxygen fraction , tidal minute ventilation , compliance , PEEP mean airway pressure record .</detailed_description>
