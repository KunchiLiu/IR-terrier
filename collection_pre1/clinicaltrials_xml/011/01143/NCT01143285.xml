	<brief_title>Impact Early Active Nutritional Dietary Management grade3 More Toxicities Induced Chemotherapy Targeted Therapies Administered Patients First Intention Non Surgical Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The `` Nutricancer study '' carry 2,000 French patient show malnutrition prevalence rate 39 % cancer patient . Malnutrition independent risk factor hospital-acquired infection . It also increase complication rate follow surgery , chemotherapy radiotherapy . It may require reduction chemotherapy dosage , thus decrease effectiveness treatment . It increase length hospital stay cost care , negative impact quality life patient ( 2 , 3 ) . Nutritional management sufficient . Close 60 % patient include Nutricancer study report receive nutritional support . Yet , benefit nutritional support perioperative care surgical colorectal cancer well establish . A recent study suggest early active nutritional support rectal cancer patient reduce risk malnutrition , complication radiotherapy increase quality life patient . Close half patient receive FOLFOX FOLFIRI type chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer ( CRC ) develop grade 3 toxicity . Our hypothesis active nutritional support chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer permit sustainability intakes nutritional status patient lead reduction complication , improvement quality life reduction length hospital stay . The goal study show early active nutritional dietary management ( early nutritional support short ) chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer decrease risk malnutrition , reduce chemotherapy toxicity , improve quality life decrease length hospital stay . The main evaluation criterion study frequency grade 3 toxicity patient receive active nutritional support first line chemotherapy and/or target therapy non surgical metastatic colorectal cancer . Experimental framework : This prospective , multicentre , open , sample-based clinical trial . Patients eligible study must diagnose non surgical metastatic colorectal cancer plan receive 5FU/oxaliplatine 5FU/irinotecan base chemotherapy , associate targeted therapy . The main exclusion criterion severe malnutrition , adjuvant radiotherapy , artificial nutrition , pregnancy breastfeeding , another severe active disease participation another clinical trial . The ChimioDiet study propose consultation meant set chemotherapy . Selected patient randomly assign two group : - Group I : patient receive active nutritional support first chemotherapy session . - Group II : patient initially receive active nutritional support . Random assignment patient group automatically generate e-CRF software , take account need stratification accord research centre chemotherapy type . An evaluation nutritional status carry every two week ( weight , appetite intake record ) . Patients malnutrition dietary intake 50 % recommend daily intake 2 consecutive consultation receive protein- calorie-rich oral supplement , require , enteral parenteral artificial nutrition . All undesirable effect chemotherapy record . Patients require fill quality life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) upon selection inclusion study every three month thereafter . The analysis main judgement criterion rely logistic regression . Measured outcome occurrence grade 3 toxicity . The main explanatory variable group patient assign ( early active nutritional support ) . The analysis also take account main stratification parameter , namely treatment centre type chemotherapy . Description active nutritional support : Early active nutritional support mainly concern maintain protein energy intake level despite chemotherapy . A part-time nutritionist assign research centre . She cover active nutritional support one-hour consultation assist investigate oncologist fill e-CRF data . A two-day meeting prior beginning study enable standardization active nutritional support strategy across research centre : - The nutritionist explain consequence side effect chemotherapy appetite level nutritional status . - Spontaneous oral intake eat habit assess base qualitative quantitative 3-day food record . - Then nutritionist explain patient adapt diet ( fortification , portion control etc . ) accord personal preference dietary habit , appetite fluctuation side effect . - A booklet contain overview nutritional counsel , recipe idea , example daily menu , energy equivalence table specific diet hygiene tip possible side effect chemotherapy give patient . - During consultation , patient weigh , appetite food intake evaluate ( 24-hour record except prospective 3-day record V0 , V3 , V6 , V9 , V12 , V13 V14 consultation ) , chemotherapy side effect record nutritional counsel adapt patient 's individual situation .
