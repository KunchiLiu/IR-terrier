	<brief_title>Hepatitis C Translating Initiatives Depression Into Effective Solutions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Background Rationale : Depression highly prevalent , yet under-diagnosed under-treated CHC . Treatment model increase collaborative management depression mental health physical health clinician improve quality outcome , collaborative care model identify best-practice depression VA primary care setting . However , antiviral treatment CHC patient may benefit exist primary care-mental health integration antiviral treatment time-limited conduct specialty clinic . Although little evidence evaluate effect collaborative depression care specialty setting , QUERI HIV-hepatitis initiate one first effort effectively implement collaborative depression care HIV clinic . Built experience , intensive yet focus collaborative care model CHC clinic may effective improve depression also CHC care . This propose study , `` Hepatitis-Translating Initiatives Depression Effective Solutions ( HEP-TIDES ) '' target issue . Project Objectives : The proposal three overarch primary aim one exploratory aim . The primary aim ( 1 ) adapt adopt collaborative care model improve depression care specialty CHC care setting , ( 2 ) compare effectiveness HEP-TIDES usual care improve CHC care , ( 3 ) compare effectiveness HEP-TIDES usual care improve depression care . The exploratory aim evaluate cost-effectiveness HEP-TIDES versus usual care . Project Methods : HEP-TIDES multi-site , multi-method implementation project . HEP-TIDES use evidence-based quality improvement ( EBQI ) method adapt implement depression screen collaborative care model depression CHC clinic 4 disparate VA facility ( aim 1 ) . HEP-TIDES involve CHC mental health provider work off-site depression care team comprise depression care nurse manager , pharmacist , psychiatrist . The purpose team support CHC mental health clinician deliver evidence-based stepped-care depression treatment . The adapted model also take account substance use disorder among CHC patient . HEP-TIDES implementation assess use formative evaluation implementation process summative evaluation randomize control implementation trial collaborative depression care 242 patient ( aim 2 3 ) .</detailed_description>
