	<brief_summary>The aim study observe document surgical practice evaluate patient ' outcome follow MAST™ single double level instrument fusion procedure use PLIF ( Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion ) TLIF ( Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion ) techniques treatment degenerative lumbar spine `` real-world '' patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective , Multicenter Observational Study MAST™ ( Minimal Access Spinal Technologies ) Fusion Procedures Treatment Degenerative Lumbar Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Instrumented lumbar fusion usually do open procedure involve excessive intraoperative dissection retraction paraspinal musculature lead , short term basis , prolonged recovery time surgery . This open approach frequently associate significant blood loss need transfusion , produce majority perioperative pain , increase hospital stay chance infection delay return normal activity work . In long term basis , open procedure lead denervation , atrophy loss muscle independent function , result increase risk `` fusion disease '' , term coin describe occurrence . The minimally invasive spinal surgery develop potential solution above-mentioned problem reduce amount iatrogenic soft tissue injury reach traditional goal open procedure . Besides minimize long-term effect exposure-related muscle injury , minimally invasive lumbar fusion technique hold promise immediate short-term advantage . Patients undergo minimally invasive procedure report recover early surgery . Shorter time first ambulation , less pain medication consumption , less blood loss , less required transfusion , short hospital stay earlier return work generally associate minimally invasive procedure compare standard open surgery . The minimally invasive access require surgical corridor target disease accomplish use series tubular muscle dilator allow clear intraoperative visualization perform procedures together parallel use image guide percutaneous insertion pedicle screw instrumentation . The purpose study observe document surgical practice evaluate patient ' outcome follow MAST™ single double level instrument fusion procedure use PLIF TLIF technique treatment degenerative lumbar spine `` real-world '' patient population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient &gt; 18 year age ( minimum age require local regulation ) . Patient indication single double level instrument lumbar fusion treatment degenerative lumbar spine . Patient agree participate study able sign Data Release Form/Informed Consent . The procedure plan patient complies label Devices may use surgical procedure describe section B.2 Device Information . Patient plan submit fusion procedure use PLIF TLIF technique receive CD HORIZON® Spinal System via MAST™ approach . The patient willing able cooperate study procedure require followup visit . Patient already undergone open lumbar spine surgery microdiscectomy . Indications procedure degenerative spine disease like Osteoporotic vertebral fracture , Spine trauma fracture Spine tumor . In order reduce much possible bias observational study , study center propose study consecutive individual meet exclusion criterion participate study order comply 'real world ' population concept . This observational study require specific test procedure fall outside standard surgical procedure patient followup routinely do hospital . Some data collect center apply procedure standard care .</criteria>
