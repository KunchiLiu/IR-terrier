	<brief_summary>Background : - The experience volition accompanies voluntary movement divide sense , decide move , sense agency , feel movement make self-generated . Very little known regard neurological origin sense volition . Previous research show particular part brain , parietal lobe , involved inner sense control movement make . Researchers interested determine sense rely sensory information move finger reach parietal lobe . Objectives : - To determine brain region responsible sense volition associate sense agency . Eligibility : - Healthy right-handed individual 18 55 year age . Design : - The study involve screen visit two test visit . The screen visit last 30 minute 1 hour , test visit last 3 4 hour . - Participants screen physical examination medical history . - At test visit , participant brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , electroencephalography ( EEG ) , electromyography ( EMG ) . The MRI scan EEG do movement task involve thumb , second finger , fifth finger one hand . EMG use monitor movement muscle activity . - During second test visit , participant receive nerve block use anesthetic , follow MRI , EEG , EMG movement task . The nerve block temporarily numb prevent movement part hand finger . - After MRI scan EEG recording , participant ask rate much control felt choose whether move , much control felt actually make movement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study determine brain region responsible sense volition associate sense agency . Nerve block use interfere movement and/or sensory feedback movement . STUDY POPULATION : Healthy subject DESIGN : The initial study evaluate brain activity attempt move different finger ulnar nerve block use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , electroencephalography ( EEG ) surface electromyography ( EMG ) . Subjects attempt move fifth finger , second finger thumb . These finger also move experimenter passive condition . The paradigm do without anesthesia ulnar nerve block . For fMRI , EEG EMG , analysis do single event design . As primary outcome , hypothesize subtract activation associate attempt move paralyze anesthetized 5th finger , well activation associate passive movement 5th finger without anesthesia , normal movement finger ( without anesthesia ) , show activation remain inferior parietal lobule , may area responsible feeling agency . The activation associate attempt move second finger , paralyze partially anesthetize , secondary outcome study , subtraction activation associate three finger . OUTCOME MEASURES : fMRI : Comparison BOLD signal different brain region different finger movement attempt finger movement . The primary outcome measure difference BOLD activation inferior parietal lobule associate attempt move 5th finger anesthesia compare activation associate move 5th finger actively minus 5th finger move passively ( anesthesia ) . Restated , trial anesthesia , activation active 5th finger movement ( reflect ( W ) , motor program ( P ) , sensory feedback ( S ) agency ( A ) ) minus passive 5th finger movement ( reflect S ) compare activation attempt move 5th finger ulnar block ( reflect W P ) . By compare ( W+P+S+A minus S ) ( W+P ) region inferior parietal lobule , expect see activation associate A , agency . EEG/EMG : Movement-related cortical potential compare different finger movement , use EMG mark onset movement ; secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
