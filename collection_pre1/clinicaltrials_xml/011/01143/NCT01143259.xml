	<brief_title>Intermountain Healthcare 's Enhanced Recovery Protocol Colon Surgery With Without Alvimopan Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Narcotic pain medicine bind mu-opioid receptor bowel delay return normal function . Alvimopan peripherally act mu-opioid receptor antagonist block mu-opioid receptor gastrointestinal tract compromise central nervous system-mediated opioid-based analgesia . Length stay important surrogate measure quality colon surgery common reason prolonged Length Stay abdominal surgery delay gastrointestinal recovery ( postoperative ileus ) . The Food Drug Administration approve alvimopan ( dose preoperatively twice daily postoperatively 15 in-hospital dos ) acceleration upper low gastrointestinal recovery partial bowel resection primary anastomosis . In 5 phase III alvimopan efficacy trial , simple standardize accelerate postoperative care pathway use rather comprehensive , multidisciplinary colon surgery care process model use Intermountain Healthcare . In recently complete alvimopan phase III trial , mean postoperative length stay 5.2 day whereas mean length stay Intermountain Healthcare 4.4 day without addition alvimopan multidisciplinary colon care process model . This trial investigate addition alvimopan Intermountain Healthcare multidisciplinary care process decrease length stay compare multidisciplinary care process plus placebo .</detailed_description>
