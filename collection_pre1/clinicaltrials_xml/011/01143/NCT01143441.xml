	<brief_summary>Objective : The primary goal study investigate mechanism action ( MOA ) CD25-blocking therapy high inflammatory multiple sclerosis ( HI-MS ) . The secondary goal study assess long-term safety efficacy CD25-blocking therapy HI-MS. Study population : Two cohort patient enrol : - Long-term daclizumab therapy cohort : Up 15 daclizumab-treated patient relapsing-remitting ( RR-MS ) secondary-progressive MS ( SP-MS ) previously classify HI-MS base MRI/clinical criterion , treat IV daclizumab minimum 1 year respond therapy significant ( &gt; 70 % ) decrease contrast-enhancing lesion ( CEL ) stabilization/improvement disease activity ( &gt; 60 % decrease MS relapse stable improve EDSS disability score ) . - New treatment cohort : Up 15 HI-MS patient ( RR- SP-MS ) inadequate therapeutic response first-line , FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapy MS , reason , treat first-line , FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapy MS. Design : This open label , Phase I trial 150 mg daclizumab high yield process ( DAC HYP ) administer subcutaneously ( SC ) every 4 week total 3 year . Outcome measure : Because main goal study investigate MOA CD25-blocking therapy MS , primary outcome mechanistic immunological study perform clinical sample ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cell skin biopsy ) derive DAC HYP-treated patient .

	<detailed_description>Objective : The primary goal study investigate mechanism action ( MOA ) CD25-blocking therapy high inflammatory multiple sclerosis ( HI-MS ) . The secondary goal study assess long-term safety efficacy CD25-blocking therapy HI-MS. Study population : We enroll 70 patient . We expect screen 40 HI-MS participant yield 31 patient receive study drug . Two cohort patient enrol treatment part protocol : A . Long-term daclizumab therapy cohort : 16 daclizumab-treated patient relapsing-remitting ( RR-MS ) secondary-progressive MS ( SP-MS ) previously classify HI-MS base MRI/clinical criterion , treat IV daclizumab minimum 1 year respond therapy significant ( &gt; 70 % ) decrease contrast-enhancing lesion ( CEL ) stabilization/improvement disease activity ( &gt; 60 % decrease MS relapse stable improve EDSS disability score ) . B . New treatment cohort : 15 HI-MS patient ( RR- SP-MS ) inadequate therapeutic response first-line , FDA-approved immunomodulatory therapy MS choose , reason , treat first-line , FDAapproved immunomodulatory therapy MS. Up 30 subject inflammatory MS screen yield 20 control immunization skin biopsy study ( Cohort C : MS control ) . Design : This open label , Phase I trial 150 mg daclizumab high yield process ( DAC HYP ) administer subcutaneously ( SC ) every 4 week total 3 year . Outcome measure : Because main goal study investigate MOA CD25-blocking therapy MS , primary outcome mechanistic immunological study perform clinical sample ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) cell skin biopsy ) derive DAC HYP-treated patient .
