	<brief_title>Interventional Study Adults With Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura ( ITP ) Receiving Romiplostim</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include 4-week screening period , 12-month romiplostim treatment period , romiplostim dose-tapering period . During 12-month treatment period romiplostim dos could increase decreased maintain platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L ≤ 200 x 10^9/L . Participants dose reduce long require treatment romiplostim 12-month treatment period continue require study procedure 12 month monitor ITP remission least 6 month . At completion 12-month treatment period , participant receive romiplostim platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L enter taper period , romiplostim dose decrease 1 µg/kg every 2 week , 19 week . If participant maintains platelet count ≥ 50 x 10^9/L absence romiplostim medication ITP ( concomitant rescue ) , participant follow least 6 month confirm incidence ITP remission . If participant 's platelet count fall 50 x 10^9/L participant taper treatment romiplostim , participant enter stabilization period reinitiate romiplostim 8 week .</detailed_description>
