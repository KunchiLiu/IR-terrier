	<brief_summary>Background : - Most study infectious agent focus specific microbe , human papillomaviruses cervical cancer , hepatitis B C virus liver cancer . The skin many internal area ( include mouth gastrointestinal tract ) also contain large number naturally occur microbe , area receive much study . - Some infectious agent naturally reside body may effect health . The study naturally occur microbe human body new area research , much remains learn regard extent pattern appearance appropriate technique test . - Researchers interested collect human sample area know contain naturally occur microbe . These sample provide baseline information study . Objectives : - To collect set study sample individual apply participate study assess relationship among bacteria H. pylorus , peptic ulcer disease , gastric cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals age 21 65 participate clinical trial entitle A Phase III Randomized Trial Three Antibiotic Regimens Eradicate Helicobacter Pylori . Design : - Researchers collect oral ( saliva ) , colonic , skin swab sample study participant test positive presence H. pylorus bacteria . These sample collect three study visit ( enrollment , 6 week , 1 year ) . - Researchers also collect sample people apply clinical trial test positive H. pylorus . These sample collect enrollment visit 1 year later . - Blood sample collect study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study infectious agent role disease new . Most effort area focus specific agent , human papillomaviruses cervical cancer , Helicobacter pylorus ( HP ) gastric disease carcinoma , hepatitis B C virus liver cancer , name . The body skin mucosal surface play host microbial community ( microbiome ) whose membership outnumber somatic germ cell order magnitude . The skin , oral , gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract densely colonized surface . Recent technological advance , however , make exploration microbiome , understudied area , feasible . It reasonable hypothesize infectious agent naturally reside body may impact health , perhaps balance various micro-organisms effect health . This new field study much promise could lead important new discovery infectious agent associate disease environmental ( e.g. , diet ) host response ( e.g. , immune response genetics ) agent determine chronic pattern colonization subsequent disease risk . However , study human microbiome new area research , much remains learn regard : ) extent pattern microbiome various site , b ) determinant pattern ( e.g. , consistency time ) , c ) optimal assay technique . Prior launch large-scale epidemiological study evaluate association microbiome disease ( include cancer ) , crucial conduct well-designed , systematic , methodological study address issue list . These methodological study begin provide baseline information could use plan , conduct disease association study . We propose initiate study collect oral , skin , vaginal ( woman ) , penile ( men ) colonic sample enrollment 6 month later 150 individual . Our objective : 1 . To evaluate microbiome heterogeneity individual across specimen type - colonic/oral/skin/vaginal/penile . 2 . To evaluate microbiome heterogeneity within individual ( time across specimen type - colonic/oral/skin/vaginal/penile ) . 3 . To evaluate effect self-reported antibiotic treatment oral , colonic , skin , penile vaginal microbiomes diversity richness . 4 . To evaluate association colonic microbiome gastrointestinal symptom disorder ( assessed Rome III questionnaire - detail diagnostic questionnaire adult functional gastrointestinal disorder ) , inflammatory marker ( initially use measure C-reactive protein ( CRP ) ) , demographic factor . 5 . To evaluate reproducibility assay use measure microbiota compare diversity abundance determine different assay .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : Individuals meet age criterion 18 year older interested study ask provide write informed consent . Participants must willing reside study area study duration ( 6 month ) . Those individual know medical condition may limit life expectancy short term ( include limit : congestive heart failure , renal failure , prior malignancy , chronic disease limit functional status extent individual perform light work usual activity daily self care ) ineligible inclusion study . Female participant must pregnant . Individuals report recent antibiotic use defer enrol least 6 week without antibiotic use . In Hojancha , region Guanacaste , Costa Rica , study conduct , population base census complete March 2009 serve basis enrollment , allow recruitment representative sample population . The census use identify participant another study area . Therefore , use census , exclude participant enrol study . Eligible participant must willing return one followup visit : 6 month initial enrollment visit willing allow submission blood assay serum immune marker , host genetic susceptibility environmental factor , provide consent use specimen .</criteria>
