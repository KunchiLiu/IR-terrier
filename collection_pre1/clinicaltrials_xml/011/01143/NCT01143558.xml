	<brief_summary>Background : Lyme disease infection cause Borrelia burgdorferi , bacteria transmit human tick . It cause many different symptom include rash , fever , headache , meningitis ( infection central nervous system ) , arthritis . While patient improve take antibiotic , patient continue symptom . It currently unknown patient continue symptom . One possibility antibiotic successfully get rid bacteria . Current test Lyme disease tell whether bacteria successfully eliminate body . Xenodiagnosis way look Borrelia bacteria use animal usually host , Ixodes scapularis ( also know deer tick ) . This method take advantage evolution bacteria insect transmits infection , make insect particularly good finding agent . In study animal , xenodiagnosis may sensitive current test detect presence Lyme disease bacteria . Researchers interested use xenodiagnosis determine whether uninfected tick fee human infect Lyme disease bacteria detect continue presence live bacteria . Objectives : - To determine whether xenodiagnosis use successfully investigate presence Lyme disease bacteria . Eligibility : 1 . Individuals least 18 year age one follow category : 2 . Have erythema migrans rash ( symptom Lyme infection ) receive antibiotic therapy le 4 month ago ( antibiotic previous month ) . 3 . Have erythema migrans rash receive less 2 day antibiotic therapy . 4 . Have diagnose early late Lyme disease , receive antibiotic therapy , still high level antibody bacteria least 6 month therapy , receive antibiotic past 3 month . 5 . Have diagnose early late Lyme disease , receive antibiotic therapy , new complaint fatigue symptom persistent least 6 month completion antibiotic therapy , receive antibiotic past 3 month . 6 . Have diagnose Lyme arthritis yet receive antibiotic therapy . 7 . Healthy volunteer Lyme disease also include study . Design : - Participants initial visit physical examination , medical history , blood sample . - For first study visit , researcher place strip filter paper small plastic container 20 30 disease-free tick participant skin . If possible , tick place site Lyme disease rash another suspicious area , nondominant forearm . Participants ask keep tick place , keep diary card home record symptoms problem . - The tick collect 4 6 day placement . At visit , participant skin biopsy take area test , blood sample collect , participant receive new diary card keep next clinic visit . - After 1 month , participant provide final blood sample , receive follow-up phone call 2 month afterward .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Searching Persistence Infection Lyme Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lyme disease common vector borne disease United States . Although antibiotic therapy clinically effective treating symptom Lyme disease patient early course disease , significant number patient receive therapy report persistent symptom . The cause persistent symptom antibiotic therapy Lyme disease area great controversy . Recent study show organism ( Borrelia burgdorferi ) may persist animal antibiotic therapy detect use natural tick vector ( Ixodes scapularis ) acquire organism feeding ( xenodiagnosis ) . Whether occur human unknown . Currently available test human Lyme disease allow determination persistent infection antibiotic therapy . In proposal , utility xenodiagnosis identify persistence B. burgdorferi treat human Lyme disease test 120 subject various stage Lyme disease 30 healthy adult serve control . Subjects follow approximately 3 month . In Objective # 1 , subject characteristic erythema migrans ( EM ) rash treat antibiotic early ( within 3 week infection ) course Lyme disease test . After completion antibiotic therapy , 25-30 larval Ixodes tick allow feed subject biopsy EM site perform . Repleted tick collect test presence B. burgdorferi . In Objective # 2 , similar study perform , enrollment target subject elevate C6 ( region 6 VlsE surface protein B. burgdorferi ) antibody level . In Objective # 3 , patient persistent symptom antibiotic therapy evaluate . As attempt increase chance positive xenodiagnosis human , patient EM first 2 day antibiotic therapy patient untreated Lyme arthritis also evaluate . Evidence B. burgdorferi recover xenodiagnosis antibiotic therapy subject continue symptom would change current paradigm potential mechanism disease provide researcher clinicians tool identify patient persistent infection . In Objective # 4 ass safety plan xenodiagnostic procedure human . All individual underwent xenodiagnosis study assess adverse event .</detailed_description>
