	<brief_summary>Background : - Fatigue common early late side effect cancer treatment , include radiation therapy . The cause fatigue poorly understood , make hard diagnose treat . More research necessary understand patient receive cancer treatment experience fatigue . Changes mitochondrion , part body cell help provide energy cell , may contribute fatigue . Researchers interested look blood chemical mitochondrial gene cancer patient study associate fatigue . Objectives : - To study relationship fatigue effect cancer treatment . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age diagnose localized prostate cancer schedule receive external beam radiation therapy . - Participants study 09-NR-0088 , Molecular-Genetic Correlates Fatigue Cancer Patients Receiving External Beam Radiation Therapy , also eligible . Design : - This study require three outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center . - Participants see start radiation treatment , middle treatment , end treatment . Each visit take less 30 minute complete . - Participants complete questionnaire ask fatigue depression . - Participants provide blood sample research test potential HIV testing . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Mitochondrial Dysfunction Fatique Cancer Patients Following External Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatigue common early chronic adverse effect radiation correlate prevalence poorly understood . Over 40 % cancer patient receive radiation therapy management disease . While external beam intensity modulate radiation therapy ( EBRT/IMRT ) successfully increase disease-free survival rate life expectancy , ionize radiation lead increase treatment-related adverse effect include fatigue . Multidimensional cause mechanisms cancer-related fatigue remain unclear , early biomarkers prognostic radiation-induced fatigue identify . There evidence increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) formation cause cellular damage result dysfunction mitochondrion . ROS consider one major direct cause ionize radiation-induced damage , result number adverse effect ( e.g . fatigue , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , peripheral neuropathy , cognitive function impairment ) reduce efficacy treatment . Mitochondrial dysfunction involve clinical condition include fatigue associate deficient energy metabolism oxidative phosphorylation . Mitochondria vulnerable ROS generate endogenously ( e.g . mitochondrial superoxide ) exogenously ( e.g . ionize radiation , inflammation ) . Once mitochondrial protein damage , affinity substrate enzyme decrease result mitochondrial dysfunction include reduce ATP production , increase ROS generation , initiate apoptosis signal . While mitochondrial dysfunction implicate variety clinical fatigue state , physiological pathway pathophysiological mechanism complicate remain unclear . The primary purpose study explore relationship mitochondrial dysfunction fatigue prostate cancer patient receive EBRT . Specific aim include : ( 1 ) identify mitochondrial-related gene expression profile change time ; ( 2 ) quantify severity perceive fatigue , end radiation therapy ; ( 3 ) determine possible pathway early biomarkers mitochondrial dysfunction relate fatigue patient prostate cancer receive EBR . Blood sample self-administrated questionnaire collect baseline , midpoint end EBRT . Human mitochondrial PCR array utilize identify differential regulation gene involve mitochondrial dysfunction different time point compare gene expression baseline sample .</detailed_description>
