	<brief_summary>Background : - Innate immunity process white blood cell part immune system sense respond potential infection cause inflammation . Researchers interested study body respond certain environmental factor , whether body response contribute chronic illness diseases asthma certain type cancer . Objectives : - To examine specific gene protein blood cell respond environmental exposure . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 45 year age . Design : - The study involve one visit 45 60 minute . - Participants screen brief physical examination finger stick determine eligible donate blood study , complete questionnaire medication drug ( e.g. , cigarette ) may take . - Participants provide blood sample research purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effect Innate Inflammatory Response Endotoxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study examine role innate immunity Inflammatory response monocyte macrophage endotoxin . Approximately 1450 healthy participant age 18 year old identify recruited Environmental Polymorphism Registry ( EPR ) . The EPR long-term project collect store 15,000 DNA sample use research study individual great North Carolina Triangle Region . It anticipate approximately 50 % participant contact enroll 15 % participant enrol withdraw . This control , observational gene association study recruit participant basis genotype observe phenotype participant . There several SNPs interest gene TIRAP , MyD88 , ABCA1 , CD14 , CD44 , ITIH3 , ITIH4 , TLR4 , TNFa , TLR5 IRGM . In addition allele interest gene ApoE . These allele take together consider polymorphism . For polymorphism interest separate group participant recruit ( include heterozygous homozygous minor major allele SNP ) . A maximum 200 mLs blood obtain participant one visit last approximately one hour . Blood monocyte isolate donated blood sample culture obtain macrophage . The macrophage expose ex vivo endotoxin ( LPS ) PAM3CSK4 determine cell response depend genotype . The primary objective determine association select polymorphisms four gene [ TIRAP ( TIR Associated Protein ) , MyD88 ( Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response Protein 88 ) , ApoE ( Apolipoprotein E ) , ABCA1 ( ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A1 , CD14 , CD44 , ITIH3 , ITIH4 , TLR4 , TNFa , TLR5 IRGM quantitative vitro inflammatory function two cell type , macrophage neutrophil . The primary endpoint study cell type level 6 cytokine TNF alpha , IL-6 , MIP-2 , IL-8 , MCP-1 , IFN-beta ( ELISA ) induce LPS PAM3CSK4 plus baseline cytokine level ( exposure LPS PAM3CSK4 ) . We hope result study may lead discovery important information regard role MDC1 ( Mediator DNA damage Checkpoint protein 1 ) human disease , potentially identify new target future study .</detailed_description>
