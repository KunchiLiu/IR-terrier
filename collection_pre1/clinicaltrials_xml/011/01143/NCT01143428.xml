	<brief_summary>Background : - Primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS ) disorder nerve cell brain control movement degenerate . The cause PLS know , research suggest environmental factor produce oxidative stress trigger PLS people carry certain gene . Oxidative stress cause body make chemical call `` free radical '' fast natural system break . Oxidative stress trigger exposure chemical relate bodily effect lead , smoke , alcohol consumption , physical activity , psychological stress . Chemicals produce body oxidative stress measure blood urine . Researchers interested study physical , neurological , chemical effect PLS good understand effect oxidative stress disorder . Objectives : - To study relation oxidative stress diagnosis progression motor neuron disease . Eligibility : - Individuals 20 year age old diagnose PLS , symptom PLS least 5 8 year previously enrol 01-N-0145 Screening : Neurologic Disorders Muscle Stiffness Design : - Participants initial study visit three follow-up visit . Each visit require approximately 3 day test National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - As part study , participant follow test procedure : - Neurological examination test muscle strength , sensation , coordination , reflex , well clarity speech - Tests memory , attention , concentration , think - Surveys oxidative stress , include question life , mood , job hold , habit - Electromyography record electrical activity muscle - Transcranial magnetic stimulation measure electrical activity translate brain muscle - Blood , urine , skin biopsy sample test sample collection - After initial visit , participant three visit , follow 3 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Primary lateral sclerosis ( PLS ) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) motor neuron disorder different phenotype progress different rate . ALS rapidly progressive disease median survival le 5 year . Patients PLS slowly progressive course normal lifespan . One hypothesis oxidative stress affect way different motor neuron disorder progress . To test hypothesis , exposures putative trigger oxidative stress biomarkers may reflect oxidative stress assess patient motor neuron disorder . A multicenter effort ( COSMOS study ) initiate accumulate sufficient number ALS patient address hypothesis . As add-on study , PLS patient also assess multicenter effort . The objective protocol enroll PLS patient multicenter effort . The goal assess environmental factor marker oxidative stress patient establish PLS . Study Population 15 adult patient PLS symptom pure upper motor neuron dysfunction least 5 15 year . Design Patients undergo standard battery clinical , physiological , cognitive screening test enrollment , schedule follow-up evaluation visit every 12 month 36 month . Blood urine sample send collaborator Columbia University analysis marker oxidative injury genetic risk factor . Patients complete self-administered nutritional survey interview phone Columbia University investigator use questionnaire assess environmental , occupational , lifestyle psychosocial factor think trigger oxidative stress . Outcome Measures The Columbia University collaborator combine data several center regression model correlate slope decline ALS-FRS score index oxidative stress .</detailed_description>
