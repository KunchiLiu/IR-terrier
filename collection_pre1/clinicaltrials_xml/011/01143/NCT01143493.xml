	<brief_summary>Background : - Glucocorticoids primary stress response hormone release adrenal gland individual stress . Chronic ongoing elevation hormone due prolong stress medical treatment numerous harmful effect . Researchers interested learning hormone affect cell growth , development , death . To study glucocorticoid hormone , researcher plan use medication dexamethasone , affect part cell respond glucocorticoid hormone . Objectives : - To study glucocorticoid stress hormone healthy individual receive dexamethasone . Eligibility : - Healthy individual least 18 year age . - Participants must use certain medication may affect dexamethasone test , include hormonal contraception , steroid-based drug , antidepressant . Design : - This study require initial screening visit second study visit . The visit estimate require 1 2 hour participation period 14 day . - Participants screen visit 1 full physical examination medical history , initial blood sample test . - For visit 2 , participant ask abstain food drink except water 12 hour appointment , take one tablet dexamethasone 9 hour appointment . - Participants second blood sample take visit 2 , receive snack blood drawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN : This vivo vitro observational gene association study investigate functional relevance SNPs NR3C1 gene select population . A subgroup EPR genotyped identify novel SNPs NR3C1 gene . The promising SNPs functional relevance vitro assay examine . Individuals without functionally relevant , novel SNPs recruit study . In part 1 , lymphocytes participant isolate , expose ex vivo corticosteroid , gene expression profile response stimulus compare . In part 2 , vivo effect SNPs steroid responsiveness evaluate perform modify low dose dexamethasone suppression test compare genotype . The study design innovative gene association study sense participant recruit basis genotype phenotype participant observe . STUDY DURATION : It anticipate study require 48 month complete participant study visit . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Investigate vivo role hGR SNPs ( hGR9beta A3669B , hGR N363S ) steroid responsiveness perform modify dexamethasone suppression test comparing response genotype . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : Investigate role hGR SNPs ( hGR9beta A3669B , hGR N363S ) human steroid responsiveness comparing ( across genotype ) gene expression profile isolate macrophage lymphocyte expose ex vivo corticosteroid . PRIMARY ENDPOINT : Measure change serum cortisol level modify dexamethasone suppression test . SECONDARY ENDPOINT : Measure gene expression fold change microarray analysis ex vivo glucocorticoid exposure macrophages lymphocytes ; validation affect RNA ( elevate decrease expression ) PCR analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PART 1 AND 2 : Male female 18 year age old time enrollment Must participant EPR study Are genotyped determined heterozygote homozygote carrier one two hGR SNPs ( hGR9B A3669G hGR N363S ) wild type SNP location Able understand provide write informed consent participate study Able travel CRU Willing able fast period 12 hour study Healthy participant define International Red Cross guideline ( Healthy mean individual feel well perform normal activity . If individual chronic condition diabetes high blood pressure , healthy also mean treated condition control ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion Criteria Part 1 Participants follow history exclude part 1 study : Any glucocorticoid use within approximately 14 day schedule visit 1 include oral , inhaled , nasal spray , cream ( dermal/mucosal ) Pregnant currently breastfeed Planning use certain medication affect test result . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , place participant undue risk complication . Exclusion Criteria Part 2 Participants follow history exclude part 2 study avoid confound dexamethasone suppression test : Any glucocorticoid use within approximately 14 day schedule visit 2 include oral , inhaled , nasal spray , cream ( dermal/mucosal ) Pregnant currently breastfeed Currently enrol another clinical research study and/or receive investigational agent reason Does agree take dexamethasone schedule time Planning use certain medication corticosteroid , estrogen , tetracycline prior visit 2 , affect test result . If participant willing withhold medication 14 day , participant allow participate visit 2 . Participants follow history exclude part 2 study dexamethasone may cause potential harm participant : High blood pressure 160/10 mm Hg . Active coronary artery disease ( angina ) moderate severe heart failure stage New York Heart Association IIIIV Renal failure Glaucoma Uncontrolled psychiatric disorder bipolar disorder schizoaffective disorder Active systemic fungal infection Prior hypersensitivity reaction Dexamethasone Currently receive treatment cancer ( certain cancer , like lung cancer make adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , induce stress ) Any condition , investigator 's opinion , place participant undue risk complication</criteria>
