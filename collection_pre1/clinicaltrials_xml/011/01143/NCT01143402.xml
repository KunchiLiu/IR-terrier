	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study temozolomide see well work compare selumetinib treat patient melanoma eye spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Selumetinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether temozolomide effective selumetinib treat melanoma eye .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) three separate patient population uveal melanoma : Patients COHORT 1 ( guanine nucleotide bind protein [ G protein ] , q polypeptide [ Gnaq ] /G protein , alpha 11 [ Gna11 ] mutant uveal melanoma ; temozolomide [ TMZ ] /dacarbazine [ DTIC ] naive ) treat AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) TMZ ( DTIC ) ; patient COHORT 1 COHORT 2 ( Gnaq/Gna11 mutant Gnaq/Gna11 wild-type uveal melanoma ; TMZ/DTIC naive ) treat AZD6244 TMZ ( DTIC ) ; patient COHORT 3 ( Gnaq/Gna11 mutant wild-type uveal melanoma ; previously treat TMZ/DTIC ) treat AZD6244 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival ( OS ) . II . Overall response rate ( RR ) . III . To determine tolerability AZD6244 patient advance uveal melanoma . IV . To correlate PFS , OS , overall RR Gnaq Gna11 mutational status . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate clinical outcome baseline phosphorylated ( p ) -extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) , p-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( AKT ) , phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) expression immunohistochemistry . II . To correlate clinical outcome change p-ERK , p-AKT , PTEN expression immunohistochemistry . III . To correlate clinical outcome change Ki67 cleave caspase 3 . IV . To explore overall quality life ( QoL ) treatment group measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Melanoma ( FACT-M ) questionnaire . V. To explore radiographic effect treatment AZD6244 assess 18F fluorothymidine ( FLT ) -positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging . OUTLINE : Patients group 1 2 randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients group 3 assign arm II . ARM I : Patients receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients unable treated temozolomide may treat dacarbazine intravenously ( IV ) every 3 week ( approval Principal Investigator ) . Patients experience disease progression may crossover arm II . ARM II : Patients receive selumetinib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
