	<brief_title>Biomechanical Validation Transfer Assessment Instrument ( TAI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Veterans rely wheelchairs mobility , perform transfer essential achieve independence activity daily live . For example , transfer require get bed , bath tub/shower seat , commode seat , motor vehicle seat . Unfortunately transfer , along wheelchair propulsion , weight relief overhead activity believe largely contribute development shoulder pain injury . For individual rely arm independence ADL , onset pain overuse injury devastate lead increase healthcare expense , limitation activity , depression , decrease societal participation reduce quality life . Despite importance transfer daily live transfer rank among strenuous wheelchair-related activity , paucity research biomechanics transfer . During rehabilitation , achieve transfer safest efficient manner possible traditionally goal patient clinician . However , wide variation amount quality transfer training provide rehab . The ergonomics perform transfer crucial maintain maximal upper limb function pain free limb time . The technique teach patient rehab base scientific evidence uniform way measure performance . For reason , investigator develop Transfer Assessment Instrument ( TAI ) 29-item criterion-referenced construct comprise three domain 1 ) preparing transfer , 2 ) use conservation technique , 3 ) quality transfer . The instrument design used therapist clinic determine patient 's adherence 'best ' transfer technique , identify target area intervention , document performance outcomes pre-post transfer training , intervention ( e.g . trunk orthosis ) change medical status . The TAI include item address ergonomics transfer independently dependently patient need assistance either caregiver transfer equipment . The intent propose three-year study establish psychometric rigor TAI wheelchair user SCI use two-phase approach . In Phase 1 , 100 subject evaluate initial psychometric analysis tool refinement . In Phase 2 , use refine tool extensive biomechanical validation study conduct 70 individual independently perform wheelchair transfer . Tool validation important first step towards effective translation evidence-based practice clinical setting . As result , propose work great potential improve quality care veteran patient reduce incidence upper limb pain injury .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For preliminary phase ( control subject ) 1 . 18 year old 2 . Ability seat push ( seat position , elevate torso lift buttock seat use upper limb ) For final phase ( case subject ) 1 . 18 year old 2 . C4 level spinal cord injury 3 . Ability perform independent transfer ( without assistive device human assistance ) 4 . Manual wheelchair user For preliminary phase ( control subject ) ( 1 ) No significant upper extremity pain injury would inhibit ability perform transfer weight bear upper extremity . For final phase ( case subject ) 1 . No significant upper extremity pain injury would inhibit ability perform transfer weight bear upper extremity . 2 . A history cardiopulmonary ( heart/lung condition ) may exacerbate . 3 . Active pressure sore , history pressure sores may exacerbate . 4 . Functional motor control low extremity .</criteria>
