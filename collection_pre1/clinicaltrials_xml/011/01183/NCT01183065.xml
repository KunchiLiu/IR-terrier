	<brief_summary>The purpose study find experimental drug pralatrexate vitamin folic acid vitamin B12 might effective treatment head neck cancer . The reason study another drug call methotrexate use long time treat head neck cancer patient . Pralatrexate design scientist new drug work well methotrexate . Laboratory study show pralatrexate work well methotrexate kill cancer cell . Pralatrexate already study patient type cancer , lymphoma lung cancer . The result study promise . Pralatrexate recently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) new treatment cancer call peripheral T cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
