	<brief_title>The Safety Immunogenicity Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccines Health Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During early 1980s , human plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine develop China . The production vaccine adequate meet China 's need . Since introduction recombinant vaccine produce large quantity , low cost , emphasis place search recombinant hepatitis B vaccine . This vaccine think safe , immunogenic , particularly infant bear carrier mother . Since 1992 , 5mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine use one vaccine expand immunization program ( People 's Republic China ) . The 5ug recombinant hepatitis B vaccine ( yeast ) efficacious short time persistent neonate . The primary safety objective study assess safety 10 mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine chinese health neonate . The primary immunogenicity objective ass antibody response follow 3 dos immunization 10 mcg experimental dose 10 , 5 mcg control dose , Participants include 1740 healthy neonate . The primary safety objective study assess safety 10 mcg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine Chinese health neonate . The primary immunogenicity objective ass antibody response follow 3 dos immunization 10 mcg experimental dose 10 5 mcg control dose , Participants include 1740 healthy neonate . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase III study . This study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity 10ug recombinant hepatitis B vaccine ( yeast ) .

And 300 subject receive 5mcg control vaccine . All neonate vaccination within 24 hour bear . The recombinant hepatitis B vaccine administer m0 , 1 6 . Following immunization , safety measure assessment adverse event 30 day follow vaccination , serious adverse event new-onset chronic medical condition 6 month post final vaccination ( Day 180 last vaccination ) .
