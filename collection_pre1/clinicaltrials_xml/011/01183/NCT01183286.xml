	<detailed_description>Generations patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) spend childhood fight breath losing . Until recently , CF patient succumb fatal , inherited lung disease infant , young child adolescent .

Interventions make difference childhood disease self-management may set stage health outcome later life . '' ( 2003 ) We believe CFFONE , innovative approach enhance self-management , potential make kind difference live adolescent cystic fibrosis .</detailed_description>
