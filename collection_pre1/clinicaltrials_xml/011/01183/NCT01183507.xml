	<brief_title>Task Specific Exercise Prevention Disability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-clinical disability early warn system disablement process characterize select perform everyday task less often compensate task still perform . This phase serve ideal target preventative strategy treatment design individual verge disability thus interrupt occurrence outright disability . One strategy optimize transfer adaptation real-life situation task-specific exercise ( TSE ) . This type intervention hold promise determine pre-clinically disabled old adult might interrupt disablement process instead begin enablement process thus lead u good intervention treat prevent disability occur . However , complexity disablement process , extremely challenge objectively identify outcome represent change selection , optimization , compensation task ( SOC domains ) . The objective current application first , ask short long-term response TSE pre-clinically disable old adult ( age 60+ year ) . Thirdly , shed excite new light whether TSE alters neuromechanical psychological factor . We want know , part , mechanistic perspective gain insight process TSE improve disablement outcome . Also , help u good understand enhance TSE intervention treat pre-clinically disabled patient . Thus , offer two hypothesis : Hypothesis # 1 : TSE increase selection optimization everyday task , reduce compensation achieve task performance . Hypothesis # 2 . TSE mediates change SOC domains neuromechanical ( decrease variability movement increase muscle work capacity ) psychological ( increase confidence perform task increase executive function ) property . These data expect guide u design randomize controlled trial test whether TSE pre-clinically disable reduce future incidence outright disability .</detailed_description>
