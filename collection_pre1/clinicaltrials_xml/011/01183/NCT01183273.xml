	<brief_summary>Background Laparoscopy prefer surgical approach number different disease allow diagnosis treatment set safe feasible method offering enhance cosmesis . The natural evolution laparoscopy micro-laparoscopy utilizes small instrument optic . Technological advancement enable miniaturization surgical equipment without compromise diagnostic operative capability . Dr. Keith Zuccala currently perform micro-laparoscopic gastric bypass identical safety profile traditional laparoscopy ( NSQIP data comparison Dr. Laura Choi Dr. Keith Zuccala ) . The current trend laparoscopy minimize incision size decrease trauma abdominal wall . Study Design Both method never compare prospective randomize trial address follow question . 1 . Is difference outcome ? 2 . Is decrease postoperative pain ? 3 . Does decrease time work ? 4 . Does micro-laparoscopy increase OR time ? 5 . What effect cost micro-laparoscopy ? Patients randomize one method , disclose investigator best knowledge method equally safe Dr. Zuccala perform several hundred case use method . Patient Population Projected sample size would 50 patient group . Accrual feasible course 9-12 month . Data collection ( patient follow total 30 day purpose study ) 1 . NSQIP data ass outcome 2 . Postoperative usage pain medication hospital 3 . Time work 4 . OR time 5 . Direct cost procedure relate material use</brief_summary>
