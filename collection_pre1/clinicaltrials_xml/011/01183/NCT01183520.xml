	<brief_title>Effect High Omega-3 Fish Intake Lipid Peroxidation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies demonstrate intake fatty fish fish oil associate decrease cardiovascular disease chronic disease state . This related long chain omega-3 fatty acid ( n-3 ) content fish fish oil , specifically eicosapentaenoic acid docosahexaenoic acid . Although consumption high n-3 fish recommend 2005 US Dietary Guidelines Americans , specific consumption level make fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) and/or fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) total fish intake . Consumption high n-3 fish dietary supplementation fish oil lead increase level fatty acid plasma lipoprotein , cell tissue lipid . This change membrane lipid think responsible anti-inflammatory effect n-3 . Because highly unsaturated fatty acid subject peroxidation , level fish intake sufficient modify membrane n-3 content exact level enhances peroxidation unknown . We perform dose-response feeling study vary level fish ( salmon ) provide random order separate 4 week washout period . We assess level cell membrane enrichment n-3 effect lipid peroxidation outcome .</detailed_description>
