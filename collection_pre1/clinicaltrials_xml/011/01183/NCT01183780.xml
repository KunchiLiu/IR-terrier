Note participant must receive minimum 2 dos bevacizumab part firstline regimen contain chemotherapy ; addition , participant must receive least 1 cycle firstline therapy include bevacizumab , oxaliplatin fluoropyrimidine cycle . Note participant must receive 2 different fluoropyrimidines part firstline regimen ; disease progression acceptable reason discontinue 1 fluoropyrimidine start second fluoropyrimidine Receipt 2 prior systemic chemotherapy regimen set ( 1 prior regimen metastatic disease permit ) . For participant rectal cancer , sequential neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy count single systemic regimen .
