	<detailed_description>Epidemiological evidence suggest set lifetime exposure include educational occupational attainment leisure activity later life associate preserved cognitive day-to-day functioning reduce risk dementia . However , specific set activity maintain improve function late life relatively unexplored . In current study , test combine efﬁcacy two activity : cognitive training aerobic exercise . These activity show increase cognitive function brain plasticity , respectively . The cognitive intervention use train Space Fortress task . This task aim improve cognitive control process underlie multiple activity particularly affect age . We hypothesize combine two intervention produce synergistic effect signiﬁcantly improve cognitive day-to-day function healthy old adult . A total 90 cognitively-healthy old adult recruit randomly assign one three condition : control video game , control exercise combine exercise space fortress training . A range cognitive day-to-day functioning assess baseline three month train . We also assess compliance home-based version training program end 3-month laboratory-based training effect compliance measure cognition day-to-day functioning . We hypothesize intervention sustain 1-year period large beneﬁts observe participant adhere protocol . We also propose two complementary approach investigate neural correlate beneficial effect aerobic exercise cognition : 1 ) imaging -- use combination structural , metabolic , cognitive activation fMRI study evaluate neural substrate effect aerobic exercise cognition . 2 ) important correlate -- explore effect apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype , inflammatory marker cognitive reserve cognitive effect aerobic exercise .</detailed_description>
