	<detailed_description>The atrial fibrillation frequent confusion heart rhythm : preValencia increase age , consider beyond 65 year , 5 % population affect arrhythmia . It entail great risk morbidity ( thromboembolic accident cardiac insufficiency ) cardiovascular mortality ( mortality increase factor 1,7 - 2 ) independent causal pathology associate risk factor . For reason , raise real problem public health . The medical treatment PAROXYSTIC persistent atrial fibrillation associate antiarrythmic anticoagulant . The purpose maintain sinusal rhythm prevent thromboembolic complication . The success rate treatment antiarrythmic disappointing , exceed , average , 50 % 1 year . In addition incidence side effect molecules anticoagulant far negligible . Other not-pharmacological therapeutic alternative propose among resistant patient , final cardiac stimulation whose result currently convince . Ablation catheter , except surgery whose indication exceptional , curative treatment AF . The complication procedure rare ( 1 2 % ) , severe . The indication ablation currently consensus AF PAROXYSTIC repeat persistent , symptomatic , c ? ur normal pathological , resistant least 1 major treatment antiarrythmic . The effectiveness ablation validate many study within framework PAROXYSTIC persistent AF specialize center . The diffusion mode treatment limited country center practise long difficult training technique , claim great expertise , also need human material mean important . The number ablation carry consensual indication 2003 France approximately 450 . This figure weak compare prevalence disorder rate/rhythm . This lead center invest long withdrawal period patient reach 4 12 month . Awaited benefit ablation catheter : 1. reduction cost health thanks suppression treatment reduction duration frequency hospitalization consultation 2. fast rehabilitation patient active life . Principal objectives evaluation : medical economic : 1. medical evaluation effectiveness ablation radio frequency AF condition real practice : persistence sinusal rhythm . Ablation make possible cure 70 % treat patient 2. cost technique utilization result express avoided cost , reduction stop work quality life , compare medical treatment study retrospectively 1 year . Secondary objective : 1. evaluation risk ablation : complication related procedure inherent treat arrhythmia , 2. evaluation quality life treat patient : use antiarrythmic , anticoagulant , questionnaire quality life : SF 36 , professional renewal activity 3. analysis impact set ? uvre technique ablation system care various hospital complex concern 4. exploratory study determination criterion success/failure ablation . Method : national , prospective , comprise 1 year inclusion 2ans follow-up also retrospective multicentric evaluation year precede ablation , patient constitute witness . Considering assumption success await ablation 70 % , number patient include 1 year 225 order obtain precision ± 6 % determination success rate method condition real practice . In addition size sample allow analysis various medico-economic criterion construction multivariate model prediction success ablation accord characteristic patient . It check size sample perfectly possible take account current flow patient . Criteria inclusion : old patient 18 80 year present F PAROXYSTIC persistent , symptomatic , document ( least 1 episode document ECG and/or Holter ) date 6 month , repeat least 1 major anti-asynchronous treatment . Awaited result prospect : project make possible appreciate médico-economic impact therapeutic among patient present allow indication ablation . It provide essential information never yet collect France scale . It make possible develop activity hospital level , essential condition development . It also make possible appreciate operational constraint term need team distribution territory take account flow patient level necessary technicality . This study finally make possible determine predictive element therapeutic success type patient ablation bring great benefit .</detailed_description>
