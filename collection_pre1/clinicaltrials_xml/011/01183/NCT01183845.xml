	<brief_summary>The Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity validate index ass severity ileocolonic lesion . Depth ulceration evaluate segment ileocolon surface lesion ulceration report 10-cm analogic scale . The Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity main score use control trial assess endoscopic severity lesion Crohn 's Disease . The investigator aim conduct prospective pilot study primarily evaluate applicability Crohn 's Disease Endoscopic Index Severity data obtain colonic capsule endoscopy procedure , provide conventional ileo-colonoscopy capsule endoscopy lead comparable overall severity evaluation . Secondary objective assess reproducibility read data obtain CCE compare data obtain conventional ileocolonoscopy . If overall severity evaluation derive two examination comparable , secondary objective use attempt understand reason discrepancy .</brief_summary>
