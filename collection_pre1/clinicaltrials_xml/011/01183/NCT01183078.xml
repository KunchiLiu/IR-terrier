	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Utilization `` wand '' method enhance improvement drill placement , lock nail placement tibia femur fracture repair , offer less radiation exposure less operative time . The purpose research study compare efficacy distal lock intramedullary nail use standard free-hand technique guide wand technique . Distal lock placement screw intramedullary rod hold place prevent rotation . Currently , free-hand technique often utilized . With technique , surgeon us intraoperative x-rays order find hole intramedullary rod place screw . The wand technique use electromagnetic field rather x-rays find screw hole . The utilization wand technique could result improvement drill placement lock nail placement well decrease operative time radiation exposure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Measures Patients 18 year age old present emergency room Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center tibial femoral fracture suitable operative repair prospectively enrol . Inclusion criterion include patient tibia fracture femur fracture require intramedullary nailing . Retrograde intramedullary nail exclude nail interlock . The goal enrollment 24 tibial 24 femoral fracture . Data include operative time , C-arm time , `` nail miss '' obtain operating room 24 tibial 24 femoral nail . Surgeons perform procedure experience use freehand technique train guided wand prior experiment . Locking performed freehand wand technique alternate order two interlock screw . The order technique utilize first randomly assign . All procedure time , fluoroscopy time , radiation time , `` nail miss '' document . All tibial nail lock 2 mediolateral screw femurs 2 lateral medial screw . Patients receive follow-up complication 6 month period surgical procedure . Intervals follow-up 2 week , 6 week , 3 month 6 month . Anterior-posterior lateral image perform already customary usual time interval . Outcome Measure ( ) The goal prospectively assess `` wand '' technique reliable alternative standard interlock screw placement reduce operative time , C-arm exposure inadvertent `` nail miss . '' Additionally , expect exist complication relate use technique .</detailed_description>
