	<brief_summary>It essential know intestinal length anastomotic type post-operative short bowel syndrome patient . These parameter help predict long-term intestinal failure long-term parenteral nutrition usually need small length . Sometimes parameter unfortunately miss lack intraoperative measurement . Thus , necessary develop non-invasive reproducible technique ass small bowel length . This reason investigator evaluate magnetic resonance ( MR ) -enterography barium follow-through indication . There time two small study evaluate barium follow-through intestinal length measurement , none evaluate MR-enterography . However , major advantage latter lack radiation exposure possibility perform 3D . This open label single center crossover study . Short bowel syndrome patient investigator center include consent . The sequence exam ( MR enterography follow barium follow-through vice-versa ) randomly assign . Peroperative short bowel length measurement available patient . There one month two exam . The main objective study assess performance MR-enterography short bowel measurement short bowel syndrome patient , gold standard peroperative length . Secondary objective assess performance barium follow-through short bowel measurement patient , show barium follow-through perform well MR-enterography . For purpose investigator include 50 patient 2 year .</brief_summary>
