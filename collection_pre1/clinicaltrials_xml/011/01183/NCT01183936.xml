	<detailed_description>Traditionally CMM excise wide resection margin 5-cm ( sometimes 10-cm towards local lymph node basin ) radical removal lymph node . This treatment emerge recommendation Handley 1907 base single pathological specimen . This `` radical '' surgical management result bad cosmetic result , lymph oedema , long hospital inpatient stay , frequent skin graft and/or complicate skin flap reconstruction . Not 60-plus year later question arise clinical practice whether need extensive surgery mandate clinical practice substantially change late 1980 's . Retrospective study publish 1980s suggested narrow excision margin may appropriate treatment CMMs , especially thin lesion . Breslow tumour thickness CMM important prognostic indicator localise disease therefore information upon today 's surgical strategy found . However , recommendation vary world especially thick tumor . For CMM ≤ 1 mm thickness center use 1 cm margin , tumours 1.01 - 4 mm margin resection 1-3 cm depend country . Most patient CMM &gt; 4 mm operate margin 2-cm today . The different national guideline thus , somewhat confuse report 2004 Thomas show 1-cm margin CMM poor prognosis ( ≥2 mm ) associate great risk regional recurrence 3-cm margin , similar survival rate . Still , quite sound evidence exists state narrower excision - thinner tumor - safe wide surgery . To date , five publish randomise trial ( 11 report ) publish access type surgery recommend different prognostic group despite effort still controversy . In report Lens base 4 randomised trial author conclude current evidence sufficient address optimal surgical margin CMM . Furthermore Cochrane report 2009 state ; `` Current randomise trial evidence insufficient address optimal excision margin primary cutaneous melanoma '' . However , study design access `` optimal '' surgery , design compare one surgical strategy another , result interpret clinical guideline . In conclusion need additional study research require especially patient poorer prognosis , i.e . tumor &gt; 2 mm . In 1992 multicenter trial launch Swedish Melanoma Study Group . The 936 patient study include January 22 1992 May 19 2004 . Patients recruit Sweden ( 6 centre 644 pat ) , Denmark ( 180 pat ) , Estonia ( 80 pat ) Norway ( 32 pat ) . Randomisation routines set steer committee eligible patient randomise locally telephone call national international cancer centre ( upon histologically proven diagnosis sign patient consent form ) . Only patient CMM &gt; 2 mm localise disease ( fulfil in- exclusion criterion ) eligible study inclusion . Patients CMM hand , foot , head-neck ano-genital region exclude . Final surgery must plan within 8 week date diagnosis . All analysis conduct accord intention-to-treat principle . Patients follow clinically every 3 month 2 year thereafter every 6 month 5 year . Follow-up data thus collect cancer registry , cause death registry medical record . The overall mean follow-up time 6 year 9 month ( 6 year 7 month vs. 6 year 10 month ) . Statistical analysis make Kaplan Meier life-table curve . Prognostic factor assess use uni- multivariate Cox regression analysis .</detailed_description>
