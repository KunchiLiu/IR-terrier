	<brief_title>AR-42 Treating Patients With Advanced Relapsed Multiple Myeloma , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia , Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate safety estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) describe dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) AR-42 administer orally three time weekly ( Mon , Wed , Fri prefer ) week 3 week 28-day period adult advance recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , lymphoma , multiple myeloma ( MM ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize pharmacokinetics AR-42 patient population . II . To analyze patient sample descriptive information regard AR-42 pharmacodynamic change patient population . III . To obtain pilot data regard efficacy MTD measure partial complete response disease subgroup protocol expansion stage III . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral AR-42 three time weekly day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
