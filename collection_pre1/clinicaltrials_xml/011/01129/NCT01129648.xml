	<detailed_description>This study Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , multi-center , placebo-controlled study evaluate efficacy safety BCX4208 alone combination allopurinol approximately 80 subject gout . The study factorial design , evaluate dos BCX4208 previously find safe well-tolerated healthy subject subject psoriasis gout . Doses allopurinol accord package insert recommendation . Approximately 80 subject randomize equally one 16 treatment group . The study consist 3 period : Screening Period , Treatment Period , Follow-Up Period . The Screening period conduct within Day -30 Day -1 , long inclusion exclusion criterion satisfy ( see Section 8 ) . For subject receive urate-lowering therapy ; subject must discontinue urate-lowering therapy Day -14 assure washout period least 14 day enter Treatment Period . Some Screening procedure record medical history clinical laboratory test perform Screening may perform time Screening Period ( Day -30 Day -1 ) . Other Screening procedure must perform within 7 day prior first dose study drug ( i.e. , Day -7 Day -1 ) ; include : physical examination , height , weight , clinical chemistry ( include baseline qualify sUA ) , hematology , urinalysis evaluation , CD4+ , CD8+ , CD20+ , CD56+ lymphocyte count , serum pregnancy test females child-bearing potential , 12-lead ECG , vital sign assessment . An otherwise qualified subject may 2 repeat determination sUA and/or lymphocyte subset assay meet entry criterion study , long qualify sUA lymphocyte subset assay occur 7 few day prior first dose study drug . These assessment constitute Baseline assessment purpose comparison assessment post-dose . Gout flare prophylaxis colchicine naproxen require start prior first dose study drug . Colchicine 0.6 mg day begin least 7 day prior Day 1 , naproxen 250 mg twice daily start least 48 hour prior Day 1 . For subject discontinue urate-lowering therapy , require gout flare prophylaxis begin cessation urate-lowering therapy . A recording concomitant medication AEs take place time signing Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) throughout duration study . The Treatment Period begin Day 1 . Subjects arrive study clinic Day 1 overnight fast . After final review eligibility criterion , pre-dose vital sign assessment , BCX4208 , allopurinol , oxypurinol PK blood draw perform , subject randomize administer first dose study drug . Subjects remain study clinic Hour 2 , Hour 4 , Hour 8 PK sample return study clinic efficacy safety evaluation prior dose Days 2 , 8 , 15 . Subjects take study drug daily Day 1 Day 21 , Day 22 evaluation occur approximately 24 hour last dose study drug . After Day 22 evaluation , subject enter Follow-Up Period return study clinic Day 29 safety evaluation . Subjects may resume prior urate-lowering therapy assessment Day 29 . Subjects Day 29 unresolved treatment-emergent AEs follow beyond Day 29 either resolution AE clinically stable . This subset subject conclude study participation Day 50 Telephone Safety Follow-Up Contact . Efficacy assess study mean sUA concentration . Safety assess study mean physical examination , weight , clinical chemistry , hematology , urinalysis parameter , absolute CD4+ , CD8+ , CD20+ , CD56+ lymphocyte count , 12-lead ECG , vital sign assessment , AE assessment .</detailed_description>
