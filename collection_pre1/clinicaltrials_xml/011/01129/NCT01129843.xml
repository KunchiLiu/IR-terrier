	<detailed_description>To combat iron deficiency anemia , challenge much know `` '' , understand `` '' implement effective sustainable intervention . In perspective , aim trial ass effectiveness community base anemia management therapeutic intervention deliver rural anemic woman ( age 13 year ) remote hilly village ( unit randomization ) term change anemia prevalence ( unit analysis ) 3 month iron supplementation . The intervention programme `` Directly Observed Home Based daily Iron Therapy '' ( DOHBIT ) local village volunteer conceive whole community approach improve hemoglobin status affect patient remote village . A cluster-randomized trial thus design choice outset . For intervention arm trial , anemic patient receive DOHBIT ( Directly Observed Home Based daily Iron Therapy ) local village volunteer total 90 day whereas control arm trial patient receive usual standard iron therapy without daily supervision duration . Information , educational counseling strategy similar two group . Primary outcome anemia prevalence ( difference proportion ) intervention vs. control group trial intervention . Secondary outcomes two group include mean hemoglobin level , compliance side effect iron therapy , body mass index quality life score . Sample size estimate , adjust cluster randomization ( assume Intracluster Correlation Coefficient 0.05 mean cluster size 30 patients/village base pilot study ) , show 10 village , intervention control group , average 300 anemic patient per treatment arm would need treated provide sufficient power determine 20 % difference anemia prevalence two groups- reduction deem worthwhile impact intervention reliably detect 80 % power . Then statistically valid approach analysis primary outcome variable calculate single outcome measure randomize unit apply standard parametric method ( chi-square ) set summary measure , keep mind conclusion strictly applicable cluster level . Since , covariate adjustment require individual level various secondary outcome , thus different approach base individual , unit analysis , adjust cluster appropriate analyze various secondary outcome measure . Overall , DOHBIT one strategies increase capacity individual community define , analyze act address health need . Moreover , supply-demand continuum , DOHBIT utilizing facilitator motivator local level optimize demand well supply iron supplementation programme community .</detailed_description>
