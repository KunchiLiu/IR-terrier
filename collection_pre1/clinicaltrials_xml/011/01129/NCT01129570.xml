	<brief_summary>Milk thistle herbal drug may liver protection property may reduce inflammation liver . It may also anticancer effect . However milk thistle approve Food Drug Administration medical purpose United States . It use patient liver cancer previously , knowledge , many study use patient hepatitis cirrhosis . Some study show milk thistle may help reduce elevate liver function test . Siliphos derivative milk thistle absorb good type milk thistle . The investigator would like perform study identify dos siliphos safe take advance liver cancer identify positive negative side effect compound may . The investigator use information future study see siliphos use therapy patient advance liver cancer reduce elevate liver function test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Milk thistle ( MT ) historically use treat patient liver disease , show antioxidant , anti inflammatory , hepatoprotective property . It may also direct anticancer effect inhibition growth factor promotion cell cycle arrest . MT show improve LFTs several study patient cirrhosis . To knowledge , publish trial evaluate clinical efficacy MT advance HCC . We therefore propose phase I study identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) silybinphosphatidylcholine ( commercially available preparation increase bioavailability ) , patient advance HCC . We use traditional dose escalation , open label design study intervention period 3 month , follow one year observation , maximum total 30 subject , evaluate dose range 1 12 gm Siliphos . The data obtain study utilized future evaluate MT efficacy reduce liver function test advance HCC , significant implication use potential adjunctive agent patient currently limit treatment option .</detailed_description>
