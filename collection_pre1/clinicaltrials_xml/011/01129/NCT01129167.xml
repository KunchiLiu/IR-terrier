	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer often spread local invasion local structure , include fat , blood vessel , nerve , nearby organ ( stomach , duodenum , spleen , bile duct ) . Local microscopic invasion associate recurrence pancreatic cancer pancreatic resection , even original cancer surgically remove , microscopic area cancer often remain . Data pattern local invasion pancreatic cancer publish . In study , The investigator hope investigate frequency various method local invasion pancreatic adenocarcinoma . This would help investigator good understand pancreatic cancer spread , determine cancer resectable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Frequency Methods Local Invasion Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer eighth common malignancy , fifth lead cause cancer-related death , United States . Unfortunately , patient often present late course disease . Accordingly , 1- year survival rate approximately 20 % , 5-year survival rate le 4 % . Even patient local disease surgical candidate , survival five year remain 10-25 % . Staging pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically utilizes TNM classification , `` T '' represent tumor size , `` N '' represent regional lymph node metastasis , `` M '' represent distant metastasis . This type stag usually do operative resection . Unfortunately , 25 % patient find unresectable time surgical exploration . This often due local invasion metastatic disease . Local microscopic invasion associate recurrence pancreatic cancer pancreatic resection . Comprehensive data pattern local invasion pancreatic cancer publish . The investigator believe would beneficial investigate frequency various method local invasion pancreatic adenocarcinoma . A clearer understanding natural history local invasion could potentially lead good determination constitute unresectability .</detailed_description>
