	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity CVD 1902 Oral Attenuated Vaccine Prevent S. Paratyphi A Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enteric fever life-threatening illness cause several type bacterium know Salmonella , include Salmonella Paratyphi A . In United States 400 case occur year , 75 % acquire travel internationally . Typhoid fever still common develop world , affect 21.5 million person year.Besides first step towards possible oral paratyphoid A vaccine prevention enteric fever , Phase 1 trial shed light suitability guaBA , clpX strategy attenuate non-typhoidal Salmonella , also emerge pathogen public health importance . This randomized , double-blinded , Phase I study healthy design investigate safety , clinical tolerability , immunogenicity dose escalate fashion live , oral , attenuate S. Paratyphi A four dose level ( 10^6 , 10^7 , 10^8 , 10^9 CFU ) . We hypothesize S. Paratyphi A strain harbor mutation guaBA clpX well tolerate full dose range test single inoculation high dose elicit vigorous humoral cell-mediated immune response human .</detailed_description>
