	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness ACTHAR Gel , use treat 15 patient diagnosed `` treatment resistant nephrotic syndrome . '' Nephrotic syndrome group symptom include low level protein blood , swell tissue ( edema ) , especially around eye , foot hand ; high plasma level cholesterol . It cause variety disease underlie disorder damage kidney , result excessive excretion protein urine . These disease damage glomerulus , small blood vessel filter waste excess water blood pas bladder urine . As result protein loss urine , blood deficient protein . Normal amount blood protein need help regulate fluid throughout body . Protein blood normally draws water tissue bloodstream . When blood protein level low , normal movement water reverse , fluid drawn blood accumulates tissue . This excess tissue fluid cause swell puffiness ( edema ) symptom nephrotic syndrome . Nephrotic syndrome describe `` treatment resistant '' patient fail achieve sustain partial complete remission treatment least two first line therapy . The goal study determine whether injection ACTHAR Gel ( FDA approve treatment nephrotic syndrome ) six month period lead correction treatment resistant nephrotic syndrome patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome With ACTH Gel ( ACTHAR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The nephrotic syndrome characterize heavy proteinuria , edema , hyperlipidemia , thrombotic tendency . Membranous nephropathy , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , resistant minimal change disease , Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) nephropathy ( also know Berger 's disease ) common form idiopathic nephrotic syndrome adult . Asymptomatic patient idiopathic nephrotic syndrome may treat ACE inhibitor /or angiotension receptor blocker reduce proteinuria , statins treat hyperlipidemia , diuretic control edema . Patients large amount proteinuria refractory treatment often require immunosuppressive medication promote remission proteinuria nephrotic syndrome prevent progressive renal failure . All immunosuppressives multiple potential serious side effect . Some patient either relapse remission proteinuria resistant immunosuppressive therapy . A synthetic truncate analog ACTH use patient nephrotic syndrome uncontrolled trial randomize control trial membranous nephropathy . In uncontrolled study lead sustained remission nephrotic syndrome multiple form idiopathic disease include membranous nephropathy focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) . It also lead reduction total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , Lpa , elevation HDL cholesterol . In controlled randomized trial membranous nephropathy prove equivalent alternate monthly regimen corticosteroid alkylating agent widely regard first line therapy disease . This synthetic truncate analog ACTH available US . ACTHAR gel natural , highly purify , porcine ACTH available US FDA approve use nephrotic syndrome . Although ACTHAR gel use treat large number patient multiple sclerosis infantile paralysis annually , , however , use small number patient indication nephrotic syndrome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult nephrotic patient , least 18 year age 2 . Diagnosis focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) , resistant relapse minimal change disease failure achieve sustain partial complete remission nephrotic syndrome therapy least two first line therapy : corticosteroid least one immunosuppressive regimen 3 . Diagnosis membranous nephropathy failure achieve sustain partial complete remission nephrotic syndrome therapy least two first line therapy : either `` Ponticelli protocol '' alternate month pulse steroids follow oral steroid alkylating agent regimen repeat six full month therapy calcineurin inhibitor , cyclosporine tacrolimus , least one therapy 4 . Diagnosis immunoglobulin A nephropathy ( IgAN ) persistent nephrotic range proteinuria patient ACE inhibition angiotension receptor blocker ( ARB ) therapy reduce proteinuria 5 . Willing able sign inform consent 6 . Patients childbearing age must agree use birth control 1 . Patients 18 year age 2 . Patients unable sign inform consent 3 . Patients receive rituximab another monoclonal antibody within 6 month trial 4 . Patients childbearing age refuse use birth control 5 . Patients estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) less 30 ml/min/1.73m2 6 . Patients renal disease ( e.g . diabetic nephropathy , renal vascular disease ) would interfere interpretation study . 7 . Patients comorbid condition would interfere completion trial ( malignancy , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , recent myocardial infarction ) . 8 . Patients known contraindication use H.P . ACTHAR Gel , include : scleroderma , osteoporosis , systemic fungal infection , ocular herpes simplex , recent surgery , history presence peptic ulcer , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , allergy pork pork product .</criteria>
