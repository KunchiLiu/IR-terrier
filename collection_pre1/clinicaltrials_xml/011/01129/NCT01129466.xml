	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare change nasal cell HO-1 expression induce two different preparation sulforaphane ( SFN ) -containing nutritional supplement Participants : Healthy nonsmoking young adult , age 18-35 Procedures ( method ) : This pilot study use randomize crossover design . Subjects randomize receive either equivalent 4 ounces/day fresh broccoli sprout ( FBS ) food tea , equivalent amount broccoli sprout homogenate ( BSH ) , 3 consecutive day . Nasal lavage blood sample obtain , 3-day period . After least 2-week washout interval , protocol repeat alternate supplement . The primary analysis test hypothesis broccoli sprout food increase HO-1 expression similar degree equivalent amount sprout BSH</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects 2 Different Broccoli Sprout Containing Supplements Nasal Cells Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Broccoli sprout concentrate source potent phase 2 enzyme ( antioxidant ) potentiator , sulforaphane ( SFN ) form natural precursor , sulforaphane glucosinolate ( SGSâ„¢ ) . SFN isothiocyanate generate interest recently chemopreventive agent cancer research , antioxidant inflammation research . Recently publish data show 3 day intake broccoli sprout homogenate form follow significant upregulation several phase 2 enzyme nasal cell . Our group 's research UNC Center Environmental Medicine , Asthma Lung Biology ( CEMALB ) focus effect oxidant pollutant inflammatory host defense responses viral infection . One aim grant measure effect pre-treatment SFN supplement , nasal response live attenuate influenza virus vaccine . In preparation large study , propose pilot study compare effect publish BSH supplement , vs. supplementation food contain fresh broccoli sprout , relevant nasal endpoint serum SFN level .</detailed_description>
