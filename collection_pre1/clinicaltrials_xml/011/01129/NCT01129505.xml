	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity identify major neglect public health issue , prevalence unhealthy body weight increase world-wide alarming rate . There robust link fetal environment long-term influence health susceptibility future chronic disease offspring . Obesity beget obesity , unhealthy maternal metabolic state profound influence risk early obesity development child . Excessive pregnancy weight gain high pre-pregnant body-mass index ( BMI ) link gestational diabetes ( GDM ) macrosomic infant ( birth weight &gt; 4.0kg . Since much influence intrauterine milieu transmit next generation non-genetically , potentially deleterious effect reverse prevent . An intervention target school-aged child importance healthy lifestyle occur late prevent childhood obesity establish lifelong healthy body weight . To break spiralling cycle generation unhealthy body weight Canadian child , reduce risk future obesity-related health problem , imperative prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain , GDM promote healthy prenatal early postnatal lifestyle . Reversing obesity epidemic involve lifetime effort medical research community , however , next 3 year , believe may contribute solution use two-pronged approach first target pregnant overweight obese woman healthy lifestyle approach call Nutrition &amp; Exercise Lifestyle Intervention Program ( NELIP ) combine Family-based Behavioural Treatment ( FBBT ) prevent excessive weight gain GDM , promote healthy fetal environment .

Primary objective : 1 . To prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain GDM order decrease incidence macrosomia large gestational age baby 2 . To prevent weight retention postpartum encourage healthy infant feeding practice order decrease risk develop obesity first year life . Secondary objective : 1 . To track pregnancy weight gain postpartum weight loss , gradually reduce body weight need ( 0.5 kg per week ) achieve maintain healthy body weight mother 2 . To track birth weight infant growth within first year life ( 2 , 6 12 month ) , include body weight , height , BMI , body fatness , use World Health Organization growth chart standard . Currently , R. Samuel McLaughlin Foundation-Exercise Pregnancy Lab University Western Ontario research laboratory North America actively investigate metabolic change exercise pregnant postpartum woman . Our longitudinal aim reduce obesity , chronic disease risk ( diabetes ) offspring overweight obese woman use two-pronged intervention program , include healthy food choice increase physical activity ( NELIP FBBT ) initiate pregnancy reinforce early postpartum period . With NELIP team cornerstone , pilot data already collect , foresee opportunity next 3 year contribute intervention strategy patient care emphasis disease prevention healthy family lifestyle initiation early life reverse trend childhood obesity . With solid research-based initiative lab community knowledge translation health care provider , future health care cost reduce put prevention-based program practice .</detailed_description>
