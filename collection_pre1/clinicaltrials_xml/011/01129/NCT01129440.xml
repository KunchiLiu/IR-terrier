	<detailed_description>Community-based , stratify ( location ) randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) determine relative efficacy topically apply fluoride varnish ( FV ) application alone vs FV fluoride-releasing glass ionomer ( GI ) sealant occlusal surface primary molar reduce caries incidence increment 3-6 year old child . A parallel group design RCT stratify study site ( one dental one non-dental location ) conduct among 596 initially 2.5- 3-year-old child . Those eligible randomized one 2 group ( FV GIS+FV ) follow 36 month . The RCT take place two site serve primarily underserved , minority low-income population Southern California : 1 ) dental facility San Ysidro Health Center ( SYHC ) locate near U.S.-Mexican Border serve mainly Latino immigrant , 2 ) Comprehensive Health Center - Ocean View ( CHC-OV ) , non-dental set close proximity dental clinic , serve Latinos African Americans . Both site part consortium community clinic ( SYHC Inc ) locate 15 mile apart . Annual study dental examination perform trained , calibrate , study dentist determine caries ( precavitated cavitated ) incidence increment . Children identify need dental care refer appropriate treatment .</detailed_description>
