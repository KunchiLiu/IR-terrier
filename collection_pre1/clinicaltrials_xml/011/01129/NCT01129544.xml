	<brief_summary>Researchers work way treat SCID patient n't match brother sister . One goal avoid problem happen stem cell transplant parent unrelated people , repeat transplant , incomplete cure immune system , exposure chemotherapy , graft versus host disease . The idea behind gene transfer replace broken gene put piece genetic material ( DNA ) normal gene child 's cell . Gene transfer do know gene miss broken patient . For SCID-X1 , gene transfer do laboratory two previous clinical trial insert normal gene stem cell bone marrow . The bone marrow `` factory '' inside bone creates blood immune cell . So fixing gene bone marrow stem cell fix immune problem , without give chemotherapy without risk graft versus host disease , child 's cell use , rather another person 's . Out 20 subject enrol two previous trial , 18 alive good immune system gene transfer . Two survive subject receive gene correct cell 10 year ago . Gene transfer still research two reason . One enough child study tell procedure consistently successful . Of 20 child enrol previous two trial , one child correction immune system , die complication undergo stem cell transplant . The second important reason gene transfer research still learn side effect gene transfer gene transfer safely . In last two trial , 5 child experience serious side effect . These child develop leukemia relate gene transfer . Leukemia cancer white blood cell , condition white blood cell grow control . Of child , 4 5 receive chemotherapy ( medication treat cancer ) currently remission ( leukemia find sensitive testing ) , whereas one die gene transfer-related leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Transfer Severe Combined Immunodeficiency , X-linked ( SCID-X1 ) Using Self-inactivating ( SIN ) Gammaretroviral Vector</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe combine immunodeficiency ( SCID ) heterogeneous group inherit disorder characterize profound reduction absence T lymphocyte function . They arise variety molecular defect affect lymphocyte development function . The common form SCID X-linked form ( SCID-X1 ) account 40-50 % case . SCID-X1 cause defect common cytokine receptor chain , originally identify component high affinity interleukin-2 receptor ( IL-2RG ) , know essential component IL-4 , -7 , -9 -15 , -21 cytokine receptor complex . Classic SCID-X1 extremely poor prognosis without treatment . Death usually occur first year life infectious complication unless definitive treatment administer . Until recent advent somatic gene therapy , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) offer curative option patient form SCID . If genotypically match sibling donor available , HSCT highly successful procedure . However genotypically match family donor available approximately 30 % patient . For remain individual , alternative donor transplant , principally match unrelated haploidentical parental donor perform . These approach still problematic toxicity ablative therapy , graft-versus-host disease incomplete lymphoid reconstitution . Recent gene transfer trial document efficacy gene transfer disease , albeit toxicity relate insertional mutagenesis . A new generation self-inactivating ( SIN ) vector develop lack enhancer-promoter element LTR U3 region also devoid gammaretroviral coding region . A SIN vector express IL-2RG gene , pSRS11.EFS.IL2RG.pre* develop show reduction mutagenic potential compare LTR configuration non-clinical study . The current study phase I/II trial somatic gene therapy patient SCID-X1 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Diagnosis SCIDX1 base immunophenotype ( &lt; 200 CD3+ autologous T cell , confirm DNA sequence ) AND 2 . Lack HLA identical ( A , B , C , DR , DQ ) relate donor AND either one following : 1 . Patients good clinical condition readily available HLA identical ( A , B , C , DR , DQ ) unrelated donor ( readily available define : donor confirm within 6 week search , ability transplant within 3 month diagnosis ) . 2 . Patients active , therapyresistant infection medical condition significantly increase risk allogeneic transplant . Examples `` therapyresistant infection significantly increase risk allogeneic transplant '' include limit : 1. interstitial pneumonia due adenovirus parainfluenzae virus . 2. protract diarrhea require total parenteral nutrition . 3. disseminate BCG infection . 4. virusinduced lymphoproliferative disease . 5. active opportunistic infection ( eg , due Pneumocystis jiroveci , cytomegalovirus , cryptosporidium ) improve medical management . 6. active progressive pulmonary disease require mechanic ventilation . Inclusion patient diseaserelated organ dysfunction justify know poor outcome standard treatment potential lifesaving nature treatment propose . Patients highdose steroid immunosuppressive agent also consider eligible , use drug common patient SCID maternal T cell engraftment present severe interstitial lung disease . Use immunosuppressive drug affect efficacy hematopoietic cell transplantation , therefore affect efficacy gene transfer . 1 . No available molecular diagnosis confirm SCIDX1 . 2 . Patients available HLAidentical relate donor . 3 . Diagnosis active malignant disease EBVassociated lymphoproliferative disease 4 . Patients evidence infection HIV1 5 . Previous gene transfer 6 . Major ( lifethreatening ) congenital anomaly . Examples `` major ( lifethreatening ) congenital anomaly '' include , limited : unrepaired cyanotic heart disease , hypoplastic lung , anencephaly major CNS malformation , severe nonrepairable malformation gastrointestinal genitourinary tract significantly impair organ function . 7 . Other condition opinion P.I . coinvestigators , contraindicate collection and/or infusion transduce cell indicate patient 's inability follow protocol . These may include example clinical ineligibility receive anesthesia , severe deterioration clinical condition patient collection bone marrow infusion transduce cell , document refusal inability family return schedule visit . There may unforeseen rare circumstance would result exclusion patient , sudden loss legal guardianship . Although presentation disease may variable type , severity immunodeficiency uniform . The gene transfer protocol institute place haploidentical transplant patient match family donor unrelated donor transplant indicate reason specify . Apart gene transfer protocol , patient undergo additional procedure would form part equivalent haploidentical transplantation regimen , receive condition chemotherapy .</criteria>
