	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Pralatrexate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving pralatrexate together docetaxel may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give pralatrexate together docetaxel work treat patient stage IV esophageal gastroesophageal cancer fail platinum-based therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pralatrexate Docetaxel Treating Patients With Stage IV Esophageal Gastroesophageal Cancer Who Have Failed Platinum-Based Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate CR &amp; PR ( Complete Response + Partial Response ) assess RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors v 1.1 ) combination pralatrexate docetaxel patient advance esophageal gastroesophageal carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation progression free survival overall survival . II . Correlation FDG ( fludeoxyglucose ) PET ( positron emission tomography ) response define 35 % reduction SUV ( standard uptake value ) early course chemotherapy progression free overall survival addition radiographic response measure RECIST v 1.1 criterion CT imaging . OUTLINE : Patients receive pralatrexate IV 3-5 minute docetaxel IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
