	<brief_title>Bortezomib Azacitidine Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) VELCADE ( BORTEZOMIB ) combination Azacitidine patient relapsed/refractory CTCL/PTCL . II . To define specific toxicity dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) VELCADE ( BORTEZOMIB ) combination Azacitidine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) . II . To correlate biological activity Azacitidine demethylating agent ( change target gene methylation gene expression , DNMT1 protein expression , global methylation ) clinical endpoint plasma pharmacokinetics Azacitidine . III . To characterize biological activity VELCADE ( BORTEZOMIB ) potential demethylating agent . IV . To correlate intracellular concentration Azacitidine-triphosphate global DNA methylation biological endpoint well clinical response . V. To explore biologic role microRNAs determine clinical response VELCADE ( BORTEZOMIB ) plus Azacitidine combination achievement pharmacodynamic endpoint . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study bortezomib . Patients receive bortezomib IV day 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment patient follow least 30 day .</detailed_description>
