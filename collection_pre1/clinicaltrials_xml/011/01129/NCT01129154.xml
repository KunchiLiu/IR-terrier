	<brief_summary>Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( SCC ) one common malignancy caucasian population . The effect immune system development skin tumor demonstrate transplant patient take immunosuppressive agent ( 65 fold risk increase ) . It report activation EGFR RAS signal pathway play important role disease progression maybe downregulation immune system . The investigator want treat unresectable SCC patient antibody EGFR ( Vectibix® , panitumumab ) . This antibody induce tumor regression metastatic colorectal cancer approve single agent indication . The investigator want measure response rate also analyze modification expression profile key protein involve suppose involved signaling pathway EGFR regulation immune system . Chemokines CCL27 show play critical role skin-associated immune response regulate T cell home . Pivarcsi et al report downregulation CCL27 mediate activation EGFR/RAS/MAPK signaling pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab ( Vectibix® ) Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( SCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicentric study 17 patient skin squamous cancer cell . Eligible patient suitable immediate surgery . If one tumor , great 3 cm2 order allow multiple biopsy . Patients receive six infusion Panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 week progression earlier . Patients assessed baseline , week 6 every 12 week till progression . In addition clinical examination , evaluation tool include photography CT-scan , MRI PET-scan . Skin tumor biopsy perform first cycle baseline day 2 , 4 , 8 , 43 , 85 . Blood collection translational research do first cycle baseline day 2 , 4 , 8,15 , 43 , 85 . Blood collection hematology chemistry assessment do 4weeks . Patients present stable disease tumor response week 12 eligible maintenance cycle consist infusion panitumumab every 2 week till progression .</detailed_description>
