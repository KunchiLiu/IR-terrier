	<detailed_description>Understanding participant experience research volunteer critical improve effectiveness human participant protection program , strengthen public trust clinical research enterprise . Institutional Review Boards , investigator regulator tool , little direct information , validate outcome measure regard . Yet , operate rationally , IRBs investigation need data local performance , also critical ability benchmark among peer identify best practice . Historically , study evaluate participant comprehension inform consent document evaluate informed consent process serve , best , indirect measure quality participant experience , focus primarily readability text institutional process . Few study assess nature , quality efficiency entire clinical research process participant perspective , produce result actionable relevant research participant experience . This study second phase two-part study design directly measure research participant perceptions clinical research process define research participant articulate focus group relevant aspect clinical research experience . In first phase project , May 2008- November 2008 , 89 research volunteer 29 research professional eight academic research institution enrol 18 focus group assess key dimension research experience . Using qualitative research method , main theme research participant experience extract analysis transcript focus group draft survey construct . The current protocol describes field validation Research Participant Perception Survey instrument 15 academic research institution across Clinical Translational Science Awards ( CTSA ) consortium . The scope field validation study enhance support CTSA Administrative Supplement facilitate increase number participate center 9 15 institution , enlarge sample size complete survey 3600 5400 complete participant survey ( base 340 complete surveys/institution 95 % confidence interval . ) Based prior experience 45 % return rate , estimate 10,000 survey deploy across 15 institution order obtain targeted 5400 complete survey . Leveraging hospital survey expertise colleague NRC Picker , field draft survey instrument design validate instrument attain highly relevant , actionable process outcome measure . Survey data may use benchmarking assist center identify best practice offer consortium . Center-specific survey data may use improve clinical research participant experience , enhance public trust , strengthen clinical research enterprise . Information regard process study design implementation intra-consortium collaboration also derive streamline improve collaboration future .</detailed_description>
