	<brief_title>Subtotal Resection Large Acoustic Neuromas With Possible Stereotactic Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard treatment large tumor balance nerve ( acoustic neuroma vestibular schwannoma ) surgical resection . Complete removal tumor associate significant risk hear loss facial paralysis whereas incomplete removal tumor associate significant risk regrowth . Stereotactic radiation well accept therapy aim stop growth small acoustic neuroma size become large enough cause problem . The purpose study determine whether combination subtotal resection follow stereotactic radiation remnant control large acoustic neuroma without significant risk associate complete resection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient acoustic neuromas wide diameter 2.5 cm large cerebellopontine angle eligible trial . Patients deem good surgical candidate base age , general health , genetic predisposition , hear contralateral side would include subject trial . Although would include patient neurofibromatosis II trial , consider genetic predisposition recurrence , would analyze outcome separate group . Patients receive form treatment acoustic neuroma prior enrollment study include surgery radiation therapy .</criteria>
