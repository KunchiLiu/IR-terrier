The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) associate complete remission ( CR ) rate least 40 % , rate grade 3-4 extramedullary toxicity &lt; 30 % patient age 50 old previously untreated AML high-risk MDS . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . The disease-free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) therapy level dose strategy . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study bendamustine hydrochloride follow phase II study . Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) day 1-5 idarubicin IV day 1 2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year annually thereafter 3 year .</detailed_description>
