	<brief_summary>Lung cancer remain leading cause mortality malignant disease men woman worldwide . Accurate diagnosis , stag therapeutic target lung cancer pulmonary pathology vital regard provide patient expedient accurate treatment treatment plan . The pre-operative evaluation consultation patient undergo operative staging resection lung cancer multidimensional involves detailed history taking , physical examination review image study . Two important element stag pre-operative evaluation include evaluation : ( 1 ) pleural space malignant pleural effusion ( 2 ) diaphragm appropriate movement . At point time , pleural space evaluation perform use CT scan allow acquisition real-time cytological material pleural effusion due fact CT scan do diagnostic setting . Diaphragmatic movement/excursion currently assess pre-operatively impact stag post-operative pulmonary function unknown . Malignant pleural effusion recognize poor prognosticator non-small cell lung cancer patient recently upgrade T4 M1a status new edition AJCC NSCLC Staging System ( 7th Edition ) . The appreciation poor prognosis relate malignant effusion upgrade stage Stage IIIb stage IV . Recognizing stage early allow precise prognostication disease lead precision streamline treatment plan thoracic surgeon oncologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pleural Ultrasonography Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotheses : 1 . Pleural ultrasonography evaluation , quantification aspiration pleural effusion allow improve pre-operative stag alters decision-making pattern lung cancer patient . 2 . Pleural ultrasonography evaluation appropriate diaphragmatic respiratory movement predict post-operative complication patient undergoing lung cancer surgery . Objectives : The goal project within program : 1 . Evaluate improvement pre-operative stag addition pre-operative pleural ultrasonography malignant pleural effusion . 2 . Evaluate ability pre-operative diaphragmatic ultrasound predict post-operative morbidity follow pulmonary surgery . Methodology : This study consist prospective evaluation surgeon-performed pleural diaphragmatic ultrasound pre-operative evaluation lung cancer patient . All patient see thoracic surgery pre-operative clinic new presume diagnosis lung cancer approach prospective enrolment study . Consented patient undergo standard history physical examination treat thoracic surgeon . During physical examination , PULC perform study investigator . Measurements include : ( 1 ) bilateral diaphragmatic excursion sniffing , ( 2 ) pleural fluid evaluation bilateral costophrenic sulcus . Should pleural fluid find ipsilateral side mass ( tumor ) , fluid aspirate sterile condition clinic sent cytology analysis . US evaluation perform upright , supine decubitus position . Results analyze use parametric methodology order ascertain additional information gain change staging ( upstage ) addition PULC standard history physical examination initial evaluation thoracic surgical patient . The study enrol 50 patient . Recruitment occur thoracic outpatient surgical clinic CHUM . Enrolment expect level five patient per week therefore study recruitment expect take 2.5 month . Impact : The potential impact positive trial change way clinician evaluate , stage risk stratify patient undergo operative intervention lung cancer .</detailed_description>
