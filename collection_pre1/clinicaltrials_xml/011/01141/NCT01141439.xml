	<brief_summary>The objective study compare effectiveness , cost-effectiveness direct healthcare cost manage asthma patient evidence persistent asthma , follow initiation increase dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy use HFA-BDP ( Qvar® ) ( either initial therapy step-up therapy ) compare commonly prescribed alternative ICS UK , CFC-beclometasone ( BDP ) fluticasone ( FP ) meter dose inhaler ( MDIs ) . Qvar v FP analyse split adult ( 12-60yrs ) paediatrics ( 5-11yrs ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While current UK asthma guideline underpin evidence RCTs , much evidence undertaken patient representative majority current UK asthma population . In fact estimate few 10 % patient see everyday clinical practice would eligible inclusion trial . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There therefore need representative RCTs real-life observational study inform exist guideline help optimise asthma outcome . A holistic approach respiratory research would see RCT evidence compliment `` real-life '' data pragmatic trial observational study . A number trend emerge asthma prescribing warrant investigation ascertain benefit patient NHS . In particular , significant pressure exist use cheap inhaler device formulation . An analysis pragmatic trial Qvar versus standard CFC-BDP undertaken Research Real Life suggest Qvar may offer great effectiveness in.5,6 In light data , follow report detail finding study design examine effectiveness Qvar real-life clinical practice use General Practice Research Database ( GPRD ) .</detailed_description>
