	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose temsirolimus give together irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide treat young patient recurrent refractory solid tumor . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving temsirolimus combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose schedule temsirolimus administer combination irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) temozolomide every three week child recurrent refractory solid tumor . II . To define describe toxicity combination temsirolimus , irinotecan temozolomide administer schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To preliminarily define antitumor activity combination temsirolimus , irinotecan , temozolomide within confines Phase 1 study . II . To collect preliminary data regard biologic effect temsirolimus protein involve signal pathways interest pediatric solid tumor . OUTLINE : This multicenter study , dose-escalation study temsirolimus . Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 day 1 , 8 , 15 temozolomide orally ( PO ) irinotecan hydrochloride PO day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 17 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
