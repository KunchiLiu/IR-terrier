	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess feasibility home-based measurement walk capacity peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) patient , uing Global Positioning System ( GPS ) . This study state GPS technique could use clinical routine order ass walk capacity PAD patient . Patients assess first time ( test 1 ) six month later ( test 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The measurement walk capacity PAD patient important step management patient . The gold standard method ass walk capacity measurement maximal walk distance treadmill . However , treadmill measurement readily accessible relationship free-living walking capacity , although well know , weak . A novel approach develop use Global Positioning System order assess community-based walking capacity . This method show interesting result , validate technique , limit one laboratory place measurement perform . The next step therefore assess feasibility home-based measurement walk capacity use GPS technique , multicenter study regroup university hospital , independent vascular specialist ( angiologist ) private clinic ( ) .</detailed_description>
