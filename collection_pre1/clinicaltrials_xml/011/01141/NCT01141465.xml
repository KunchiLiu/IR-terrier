	<brief_summary>This study evaluate compare effectiveness asthma management patient evidence persistent asthma follow switch asthma therapy combination inhale glucocorticosteroid ( ICS ) / long-acting bronchodilator ( LABA ) therapy either : fixed-combination fluticasone propionate / salmeterol ( FP/SAL ; Seretide® ) via pressurise metered-dose inhaler ( pMDI ) dry-powder inhaler ( DPI ) plus as-needed ( prn ) reliever therapy ( salbutamol DPI , BAI pMDI ) , fixed-combination budesonide / formoterol ( BUD/FOR ; Symbicort® ) via DPI plus prn reliever therapy ( salbutamol DPI , BAI pMDI bricanyl DPI ) . The final analysis plan define exact comparators age group study review baseline data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline UK underpin evidence derive randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . Although RCT data consider gold standard , patient recruit asthma RCTs estimate represent le 10 % UK 's asthma population . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There , therefore , need representative RCTs real-life observational study inform exist guideline help optimise asthma outcome . The fixed combination asthma inhaler FP/SAL ( pMDI DPI ) BUD/FOR ( DPI ) indicate use asthma adequate asthma control achieve low / medium dose ICS therapy prn reliever therapy ( short-acting beta-agonist [ SABA ] ) . Fixed combination inhaler also indicate patient already adequately control separate ICS/LABA therapy . However , emerge trend asthma prescribe indicate increase use add-on therapy ( particularly form combination inhaler ) early stage asthma therapy , even first-line therapy . The British Thoracic Society ( BTS ) Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ( SIGN ) guideline management asthma advise difference efficacy ICS/LABA therapy give separate combine inhaler . However , note , patient stable therapy , combination inhaler advantage guarantee patient take LABA without ICS . In practice , significant pressure ( support asthma guideline ) use least expensive , effective inhaled therapy available . While effect increase use combination therapy term patient benefit remain uncertain , impact treatment cost United Kingdom 's ( UK 's ) National Health Service ( NHS ) unequivocal , date , limited data available absolute relative effectiveness ICS/LABA combination therapy currently license . There number inhaler delivery device available use asthma management . Whatever therapy prescribed , optimal treatment response require effective drug delivery within airway ; select appropriate delivery device asthma patient , therefore , play important role optimise asthma control . According recent BTS/SIGN guideline , currently evidence clinical difference effectiveness therapy delivery via pMDI ± spacer compare DPI either adults child , recent DPIs rat effective old DPIs . Effective use DPIs pMDI require entirely different inhalation technique debate whether patient prescribe different device type reliever preventer medication ( require different technique ) may poorer disease control prescribed device type preventer reliever . Combining aerosol ( e.g . pMDI preventer plus BAI reliever ) consider cause problem respect . The aim study compare absolute relative effectiveness currently license ICS/LABA combination - FP/SAL BUD/FOR ( available delivery device ) - child adult asthma whose therapy change increase . Consideration also give effect reliever therapy inhaler effect consistency device use ( i.e . different device preventer inhaler therapy ) asthma control outcome . Also evaluate associated impact inhaler technique review , record inhaler handling problem use spacer conjunction pMDI term achieve asthma control outcomes .</detailed_description>
