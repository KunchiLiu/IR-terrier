	<brief_summary>Evaluate chemotherapy related tumor marker non small cell lung cancer fluorescent situ hybridization immunohistochemistry , target study include EGFR , c-MET , topoisomerase II , p53 , topoisomerase I , thymidylate synthase , ERCC1 , tau , c-myc , RRM1 , class III tubulin . These target choose target chemotherapeutic agent currently use clinical management disease . In total 50 specimen study , approximately one third mutations/deletions EGFR gene.To attempt establish correlation pre-selected tumor marker response chemotherapy , thus able create clinically useful classification would provide clinical guidance selection effective chemotherapy individual patient , thus able logically design effective clinical trial future .</brief_summary>
