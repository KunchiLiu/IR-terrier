	<detailed_description>Major depression common morbid condition result chronicity , recurrent disability , loss physical health , many case , death suicide medical condition . By 2020 , depression project account 4.4 % global disease burden ( 1 ) loss 65 million disability-adjusted life year ( 2 ) . A United Kingdom study ( 3 ) estimate direct treatment cost would reach three billion pound 2026 indirect cost find 23 time large ( 4 ) . Anti-depressant treatment consider bona fide first line agent major depression . In real-world study , however , anti-depressant medication fare well . A large scale report , include STAR-D study , report remission rate disappointing : percentage patient attain remission first line second line trial 37 % 31 % relapse rate 40 % 55 % , respectively ( 5 ) . Studies show depression remit first line medication , common consider medication change rather commence psychotherapy ( 6 , 7 ) . For treatment refractory depression ( TRD ) , situation may due insufficient empirical evidence demonstrate efficacy psychotherapy . Current Canadian guideline depression ( 8 ) recommend psychodynamic psychotherapy third-line individual psychotherapy treatment option major depressive disorder . However , two systematic review ( 9 , 10 ) fail identify controlled trial data psychodynamic therapy TRD three good quality randomize control trial ( RCT ) psychotherapy approach . Although empirical evidence psychotherapy describe limited , author conclude appear effective option TRD ( 10 ) . Practitioners continue provide psychodynamic therapy routine clinical practice despite shortage empirical evidence ; suggest formal study psychodynamic therapy TRD urgently need . Within broad treatment rubric , Short-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy ( STPP ) category treatment derive psychoanalytic theory definition distinguishable time-limited focus emphasis symptom reduction , comparison longer-term model treatment less structured therapist typically less active . Interventions use STPPs understood continuum 'supportive ' 'expressive ' technique ( 11 ) . More expressive therapy ( e.g. , ISTDP ) emphasize great attention defence anxiety block experience underlying emotion . These emotional factor understood culminate exacerbation perpetuation depression . A meta-analysis find STPPs superior control modality study major depression ( Cohen 's = 0.69 ) high-quality , randomize control trial require ( 12 ) . Of paramount importance however , gain obtain STPPs maintain long-term follow-up . Three study demonstrate direct treatment intervention outcome relationship STPP subsequent improvement depressive symptom ( 13-15 ) . One subtype STPP method call Intensive Short Term Dynamic Psychotherapy ( ISTDP ) . ISTDP study 18 publish clinical study . Randomized controlled trial demonstrate beneficial effect patient personality disorder , panic disorder somatoform disorder ( 16-18 ) . In single case series patient treatment resistant depression , patient fare well ISTDP 8 10 achieve complete remission ( 19 ) . These patient respond relatively short course treatment reduction stoppage majority medication . At Centre Emotions &amp; Health ( CEH ) , data collect naturalistic sample non-psychotic patient present depression . The number session vary 2 62 , mean ( SD ) 8 ( 11 ) . Self-report score Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI ) ( 20 ) ( N = 95 ) Inventory Interpersonal Problems ( IIP ) ( 21 ) ( N = 84 ) collect time intake termination ISTDP . The severity clinical symptom markedly significantly reduce treatment . Eight publish study evaluate cost-effectiveness ISTDP ( 16 , 19 , 22-26 ) . Two study include patient major depression . In one study treatment-resistant depression ( n = 10 ) , saw major drop disability cost 4 5 disabled patient return work medication stop reduce ( 19 ) . In second study 231 patient major depression analyze ( Abbass , preparation ) , $ 4,400 hospital physician cost saving maintain year year , wait list control significant change time . The post treatment cost saving subsequent 3 year $ 5000 , $ 5900 $ 5100 per patient , thus support concept last cost reduction treatment ISTDP . In summary , base preliminary empirical data highlight effectiveness ISTDP , couple current paucity empirical support psychotherapy population , formal study efficacy approach treatment refractory depression warrant set control efficacy trial . As relatively brief non-invasive treatment option , research demonstrate evidence cost effectiveness clinical efficacy , would support call treatment make readily available .</detailed_description>
