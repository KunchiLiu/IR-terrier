	<brief_title>Acupuncture Treating Dry Mouth Caused By Radiation Therapy Patients With Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether acupuncture symptomatically improve moderate severe radiation-induced xerostomia ( grade 2 3 ) patient head neck cancer . Secondary - To explore duration response ( maximum 6 month ) subgroup patient report response acupuncture intervention . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord stage disease , age , sex , mean parotid radiotherapy dose receive , baseline Xerostomia Questionnaire ( XQ ) score . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive standard oral hygiene care 8 week , include instruction regard mouth rinse , use lip balm , use mild fluoride toothpaste , importance adequate oral hydration , standard advice . - Arm II : Patients receive acupuncture 3 site ear , chin , forearm , leg twice week 4 week . Patients minor response may continue treatment additional 4 week . Patients also receive standard oral hygiene arm 1 . - Arm III : Patients receive acupuncture twice week 4 week standard oral hygiene arm 1 . Patients minor response may continue treatment additional 4 week . Patients complete XQ , M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory Head Neck Cancer ( MDASI-HN ) , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT-G ) questionnaires baseline end week 4 , 8 , and12 . Patients partial response minor response , accord week-8 questionnaire , complete XQ , MDASI-HN , FACT-G end week 12 6 month . Patients group 2 3 also complete Acupuncture Expectancy Scale ( AES ) .
