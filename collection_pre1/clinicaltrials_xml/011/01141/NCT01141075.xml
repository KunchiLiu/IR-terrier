	<brief_summary>Methylmalonic acidemia rare genetic disorder cause mutation gene mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ( MCM ) one gene adenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl ) . Lack proteins cause toxic elevation methylmalonic acid ( MMacid ) blood , urine , tissue . A specific type mutation , call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation , cause disease approximately 5 20 % patient mutation MCM gene , approximately 20 &gt; 50 % patient mutation one AdoCbl gene . Ataluren ( PTC124 ) orally deliver , investigational drug act overcome effect premature stop codon , potentially enable production functional MCM/AdoCbl . This study Phase 2a trial evaluate safety activity ataluren patient methylmalonic acidemia due nonsense mutation . The main purpose study understand whether ataluren safely decrease MMacid level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ataluren Nonsense Mutation Methylmalonic Acidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , patient methylmalonic acidemia due nonsense mutation administer investigational drug call ataluren ( PTC124 ) . Evaluation procedure determine patient qualifies study perform within 14 day prior start drug administration . Eligible patient elect enroll study participate 2 drug administration follow-up period . Within first period , ataluren ( PTC124 ) take 3 time per day meal 28 day dose 5 mg/kg ( morning ) , 5 mg/kg ( midday ) 10 mg/kg ( even ) ; interval approximately 21 day without ataluren ( PTC124 ) . Within second period , ataluren ( PTC124 ) take 3 time per day meal 28 day dose 10 mg/kg ( morning ) , 10 mg/kg ( midday ) 20 mg/kg ( even ) ; interval approximately 14 day without ataluren ( PTC124 ) . During study , ataluren ( PTC124 ) activity , safety , pharmacokinetics evaluate , MMacid level blood urine measure periodically .</detailed_description>
