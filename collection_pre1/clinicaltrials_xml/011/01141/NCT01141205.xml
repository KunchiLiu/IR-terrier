	<brief_summary>Treatment : Immunization peptide-mix adjuvant . The vaccine induce cellular immunity HIV-1 . Target group : Untreated healthy individual chronic HIV-1 infection . Purpose : The primary purpose evaluate tolerability safety vaccine . The secondary purpose evaluate clinical effect vaccination treatment measure induction immunity , lower viral load , induction escape mutation virus improvement patient CD4 lymphocyte blood count . The third purpose evaluate feasibility conduct therapeutic HIV immunization study poorly-resourced African setting . Design : The experiment design blind , placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial HIV-1 infected individual West Africa . Numbers individual : Phase I : 20 fully evaluable HIV-1-infected patient enter study ( 15 vaccine treat 5 placebo ( saline ) treat control ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HIV infection leave lifelong immunity , lead break immune system , opportunistic infection death . The immunity obtain infection partially contain HIV infection . The purpose target therapeutic vaccination therefore addition exist immunity induce broader , powerful rationally well direct immunity one induce `` natural '' HIV-1 infection . This would potentially lower viral load blood make difficult spread virus others prolong time AIDS disease medical treatment . There need new rational vaccination possibility , able prevent ( HIV ) disease , postpone need antiretroviral medical treatment , prolong life , limit spread HIV-1 population . The present protocol seak introduce new immune treatment principle HIV-1 infected individual . In study , individual chronic HIV-1 infection vaccinate select synthetic HIV immune-peptides represent new discover conserved target´s virus . The vaccine induce new immunity several epitope target HIV , whereby HIV infection may control long time immune system . The purpose study primarily evaluate safety tolerability vaccine secondary evaluate immunological antiviral response vaccinate individual .</detailed_description>
