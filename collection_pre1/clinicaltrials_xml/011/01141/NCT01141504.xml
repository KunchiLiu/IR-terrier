	<brief_summary>Adenosine-triphosphate ( ATP ) serve sole energy source muscle contraction . Therefore human performance brief maximal exercise limit , part , availability ATP contract muscle . Because muscle ATP storage small ( enough sustain maximal exercise le 1 second ) , factor enhance either storage resynthesis ATP may positive impact repeat muscle contraction . The current study test hypothesis increase ATP availability muscle via oral supplementation improve performance repeat high intensity exercise measure ) work perform three 50 contraction fatigue test , b ) sum total work perform , c ) percentage decrement total work first third third 50 contraction test .</brief_summary>
