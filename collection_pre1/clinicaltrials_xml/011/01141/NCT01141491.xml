	<brief_summary>Sarcoma patient high risk cancer recur even sarcoma remove surgically treat radiation chemotherapy . The patient study randomize ( like flip coin ) receive either vaccine combine immune system stimulant immune system stimulant alone . The immune system stimulant call OPT-821 immunological booster . The trivalent vaccine develop teach patient 's immune system recognize 3 type sugar call GM2 , GD2 GD3 find primarily surface sarcoma cell . If trivalent vaccine stimulate patient 's immune system develop antibody recognize target GM2 , GD2 GM3 sugar , patient 's antibody could attack kill remain sarcoma cell potentially prevent recurrence sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trivalent Ganglioside Vaccine With Immunological Adjuvant Immunological Adjuvant Alone Metastatic Sarcoma Patients Who Are Rendered Disease Free</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase II randomize , double-blind , multi-center study trivalent ganglioside vaccine plus immunological adjuvant OPT-821 ( Arm A ) versus OPT-821 alone ( Arm B ) patient metastatic sarcoma initial presentation relapse disease render disease-free follow either surgical resection multi-modality therapy . The primary aim study demonstrate efficacy vaccine therapy non-specific immune therapy . Another aim study obtain sufficient data development specific vaccine therapy well guide future study design therapeutic cancer vaccine general . To eligible , patient must histologically confirm sarcoma , must clinically free disease surgery multimodality therapy , must within 8 week completion therapy . Given limited data regard ganglioside expression Ewing sarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , gastrointestinal stromal tumor , patient sarcoma subtypes exception pleomorphic/anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma exclude . Patients must history distant metastatic disease ; patient locally recurrent disease eligible , patient demonstrate different natural history metastatic disease . All treatment perform outpatient setting . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio receive total 10 treatment either vaccine plus OPT-821 ( Arm A ) OPT-821 alone ( Arm B ) . Treatment administer Visit Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 16 , 28 , 40 , 52 , 68 , 84 . All patient receive 150 mcg OPT-821 .</detailed_description>
