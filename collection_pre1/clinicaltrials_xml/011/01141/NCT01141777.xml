	<brief_summary>Spirulina , widely use food supplement , improve lipid profile glycemic control people live diabetes , suggest could effect insulin sensitivity . Since HIV-infected patient develop metabolic abnormality due virus and/or antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug , investigator therefore proposed evaluate effect spirulina HIV/HAART-associated insulin resistance</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Spirulina Platensis Insulin Resistance HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even though antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically improve health people live HIV/AIDS , prospect maintain patient long term ART severely restrict development serious long term effect metabolism . These abnormality include dyslipidemia , lipodystrophy disorder glucose metabolism insulin resistance believe underlying pathophysiological mechanism . Spirulina , recently draw attention cholesterol blood pressure lower effect , include improvement glycaemic control diabetic subject , suggest effect insulin sensitivity . The aim three month , experimental , prospective , randomised trial evaluate effect Spirulina HIV/HAART-associated insulin resistance 33 subject . Primary outcome change insulin sensitivity trial , two time period ; t=0 t=12 week . The second objective compare two group , percentage subject improve insulin sensitivity end study . Recruitment start October 2008 trial end February 2009 .</detailed_description>
