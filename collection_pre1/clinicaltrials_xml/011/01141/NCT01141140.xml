	<brief_summary>In face increase prevalence obesity chronic diseases Canada , much effort invest educate population healthy eating . Although Canadians aware importance healthier food habit , rate obesity chronic disease still increase . In addition , even different label strategy use identify healthy food market , consumer remain confused healthy eating . Might describe food healthy unintended side-effects food intake ? Previous literature show perception healthiness food may bias estimation caloric content food , lead consumer underestimate caloric content `` healthy '' food choice . Indeed , investigator recently show perceiving food healthy increase intake food 35 % undergraduate female student . The general objective propose research investigate whether food perception influence intake appetite sensation normal-weight overweight/obese restrain unrestrained male female . This laboratory study , perceive healthiness `` fatteningness '' oatmeal-raisin cooky manipulate ad libitum single-meal occasion , increase investigator knowledge effect external cue ( psychological physiological factor ) control food intake . Because popularity demand nutrition information increase , information need improve clinical practice aim promote sustainable healthy eat habit help individual achieve maintain healthy weight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>( Mis ) Perceptions About Healthy Eating : Effects Food Intake Appetite Men Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The laboratory study conduct Clinical Investigation Unit ( CIU ) Institute Nutraceuticals Functional Foods ( INAF ) . Food-related variable ( perceived healthiness `` fatteningness '' food ) manipulate ad libitum single-meal test . We examine effect variable food intake appetite sensation male female normal-weight overweight/obese restrain unrestrained eater . Each participant test individual basis , 2-hour experimental session ( randomized session 11:00 a.m. 5:00 p.m. ) . Because participant might change eat behavior become aware true purpose study , deception must use . Males females thus recruit participate ostensible market-research study involve taste-rating task , participant carefully debriefed end experiment . Male female normal-weight body mass index ( BMI ) ≥18.5kg/m2 &lt; 25kg/m2 overweight/obese BMI ≥25kg/m2 , restrain unrestrained eater randomly assign one three experimental condition ( `` healthy , '' `` diet , '' `` unhealthy '' ) . A plate 1000 gram ( g ) bite-sized oatmeal-raisin cooky present participant . On average , one bite-size cookie 10g , represent approximately 40 kilocalorie ( kcal ) per cookie . The manipulation healthiness `` fatteningness '' perception oatmeal-raisin cooky perform verbally experimenter follow . In `` healthy '' condition , description emphasize nutritional characteristic ( e.g. , high fibre , low saturate fat free trans-fat ) , overall healthiness snack highlight . In `` diet '' condition , description emphasize benefit oatmeal fibre weight management ( e.g. , help cope hunger ) , thereby highlight weight-loss potential snack . In `` unhealthy '' condition , description emphasize hedonic characteristic food less healthy ingredient ( e.g . gourmet cooky , contains butter sugar ) , inherent unhealthy aspect snack highlight . Males female involve study invited participate market-research study investigate various dimension new snack product . A telephone screen interview first conduct subject interested participate study ensure meet inclusion criterion , facilitate randomization prior experiment session set appointment participant . During interview , participant inform market-research study involve taste-rating task taste rate new snack food . They self-report weight height , answer descriptive question inclusion criterion ( e.g. , history health problem , current medication , like test food , prior participation study ) . They also complete Restraint Scale ass whether exhibit behavioral attitudinal concern diet weight control . Each participant categorize restrain eater ( ≥12 male ≥15 female ) unrestrained eater ( &lt; 12 male &lt; 15 female ) . Following categorization establish Restraint Scale BMI calculation , participant randomly assign one experimental condition , accord restraint weight status ( Note randomization adjust accord measure BMI ) . The telephone screen interview conduct least one week prior appointment CIU ensure ask restraint weight status affect participant ' food intake appetite sensation make restraint weight salient experiment . To standardize food intake insure subject comparable baseline appetite sensation across experimental manipulation , participant ask refrain eating oatmeal-raisin cooky ( test food ) least 24 hour prior experiment , arrive CIU appointment pre-meal state ( i.e. , least 2 hour without food prior experiment ) . Because physical activity might impact appetite sensation , participant also ask refrain strenuous exercise least 24 hour experiment . Note experimenter study strictly follow detailed script test participant ensure test consistent participant .</detailed_description>
