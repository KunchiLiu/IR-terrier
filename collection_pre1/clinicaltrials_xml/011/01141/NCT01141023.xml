	<brief_title>Study Identify Clinical , Imaging Biologic Markers Parkinson Disease Progression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PPMI five-year natural history study ( minimum 3-year involvement subject ) de novo idiopathic PD patient healthy control . This study also include SWEDD ( subject without evidence dopaminergic deficit ) Prodromal population . All subject comprehensively assess baseline every three six month thereafter . Subjects undergo clinical ( motor , neuropsychiatric cognitive ) image assessment donate blood , urine , cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) . A blood sample DNA collect . Data collect site uniformly establish protocol data analyze store designate core facility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Parkinson Disease ( PD ) Subjects : A diagnosis Parkinson disease 2 year less Screening . Confirmation image core screening DAT scan consistent dopamine transporter deficit , applicable VMAT2 PET scan consistent vesicular monoamine transporter deficit . Not expect require PD medication least 6 month Baseline . Male female age 30 year old time PD diagnosis . Healthy Control ( HC ) Subjects : â€¢ Male female age 30 year old Screening . Parkinson Disease ( PD ) Subjects : Currently take levodopa , dopamine agonist , MAOB inhibitor , amantadine PD medication . Has take levodopa , dopamine agonist , MAOB inhibitor amantadine within 60 day Baseline . Has take levodopa dopamine agonist prior Baseline total 60 day . Received follow drug might interfere DAT imaging : Neuroleptics , metoclopramide , alpha methyldopa , methylphenidate , reserpine , amphetamine derivative , within 6 month Screening . Current treatment anticoagulant ( e.g. , coumadin , heparin ) might preclude safe completion lumbar puncture . If applicable , currently take medication know cause QTprolongation , currently take tetrabenazine ( TBZ amphetamine type medication . Condition preclude safe performance routine lumbar puncture , prohibitive lumbar spinal disease , bleed diathesis , clinically significant coagulopathy thrombocytopenia . Use investigational drug within 60 day prior Baseline ( dietary supplement take outside clinical trial exclusionary , e.g. , coenzyme Q10 ) . Healthy Control ( HC ) Subjects : Current active neurological disorder . First degree relative idiopathic PD ( parent , sibling , child ) . MoCA score &lt; 26 . Received follow drug might interfere DAT imaging : Neuroleptics , metoclopramide , alpha methyldopa , methylphenidate , reserpine , amphetamine derivative , within 6 month Screening . If applicable , currently take medication know cause QTprolongation , currently take tetrabenazine ( TBZ ) amphetamine type medication . Current treatment anticoagulant ( e.g. , coumadin , heparin ) might preclude safe completion lumbar puncture . Condition preclude safe performance routine lumbar puncture , prohibitive lumbar spinal disease , bleed diathesis , clinically significant coagulopathy thrombocytopenia . Use investigational drug within 60 day prior baseline ( dietary supplement take outside clinical trial exclusionary , e.g. , coenzyme Q10 ) . SWEDD Subjects : All PD criterion apply , , except SWEDD subject must confirmation image core screening dopamine transporter SPECT scan show evidence dopamine transporter deficit applicable VMAT2 PET scan show evidence vesicular monoamine transporter deficit . Prodromal Subjects : Inclusion Criteria ( Prodromal Subjects ) 4.2.7.1 . Subjects must least one follow characteristic : Hyposmia : 1 . Male female age 60 year old 2 .
