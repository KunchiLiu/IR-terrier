	<brief_summary>The objective study compare effectiveness , cost-effectiveness direct healthcare cost manage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) primary care patient evidence COPD either initiate inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) therapy , increase ICS dose , hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) beclometasone dipropionate ( BDP ) ( hereafter Qvar® ) , CFC-BDP ( hereafter BDP ) fluticasone propionate ( FP ) via pressurise metered-dose inhaler .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline UK underpin evidence derive randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . Although RCT data consider gold standard , patient recruit asthma RCTs estimate represent le 10 % UK 's asthma population . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There , therefore , need representative RCTs real-life observational study inform exist guideline help optimise asthma outcome . Short randomise trial show Qvar least effective FP pMDI BDP pMDI half prescribe dose patient asthma . There also evidence suggest , adult , HFA formulation use Qvar ( feature BDP solution rather suspension ) may achieve 10-fold high deposition compare CFC-BDP.4 Furthermore , deposition peripheral region higher compare CFC-BDP fine-particle formulation also offer great tolerance poor co-ordination breathe inhaler actuation , result low oro-pharyngeal deposition compare CFC-BDP . Evidence efficacy ICS monotherapy COPD remain mixed time . While Qvar ICS monotherapy use treatment COPD currently off-label , occur clinical practice two common scenario : 1. diagnosis COPD make 2. unlicensed use monotherapy , combination long-acting bronchodilator The study hypothesis , therefore , Qvar treatment COPD may associate improved disease management control ( assessed effectiveness , cost-effectiveness direct healthcare cost manage COPD ) compare commonly use ICS therapy , namely BPD FP , virtue improve deposition throughout lung small airway .</detailed_description>
