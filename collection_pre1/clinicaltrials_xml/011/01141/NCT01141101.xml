	<brief_summary>The prevalence Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) colonization infection increase general population , include pediatric population . It report MRSA colonization persist four year , therefore young pediatric patient , specifically less 2 year age , high risk prolong colonization period time susceptible significant skin soft tissue infection ( SSTIs ) attributable MRSA . Once prolonged colonization take place , recurrent SSTIs commonplace , result substantial morbidity case mortality , well significant cost healthcare system . Individuals colonize MRSA increase risk develop MRSA infection , range mild disease , carbuncle , severe infection , necrotizing pneumonia toxic shock syndrome . The prevalence severe MRSA infection also greatest neonate infant , increase MRSA colonization observe . In early infant period , common manifestation MRSA disease pustular skin lesion , affect approximately 5 % general population , MRSA-colonization major risk factor disease . Moreover , prevalence pustular disease increase general population , numerous case report invasive , life-threatening MRSA disease early infant period . Corresponding increase prevalence community , carriage MRSA pregnant woman also escalate , vaginal carriage significant pregnant woman . As analogy , maternal vaginal Group B Streptococcal ( GBS ) colonization major risk infant colonization regardless whether early late neonatal colonization disease occur . It quite feasible vaginal MRSA carriage predisposes newborns colonization birth process ; however , mechanism yet well study . There mechanisms implicate early infant colonization , include close contact MRSA-colonized mother daily care breastfeed . MRSA colonization one household member greatly predispose colonization others ; therefore , early infant colonization could result contact MRSA-colonized individual household . Currently , clear factor important influence early infant MRSA colonization subsequent infection . Not prevalence MRSA colonization infection rise , measure establish prevent colonization subsequent infection adult child . Eradication measure show limited long-term benefit . If vertical transmission MRSA establish critical event pathogenesis disease , potentially effective strategy could test , possibly spread MRSA community interrupt . Hypotheses Specific Aims : 1 . Identify proportion , rate time MRSA colonization infant born mother without MRSA colonization ; 2 . Compare risk factor infant MRSA colonization two group ; 3 . Determine prevalence risk factor develop MRSA infection MRSA-colonized infant .</brief_summary>
