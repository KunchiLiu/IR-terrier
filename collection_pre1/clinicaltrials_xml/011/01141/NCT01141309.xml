	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , combination sorafenib everolimus thyroid cancer . Treatment guideline National Comprehensive Cancer Network include sorafenib treatment option thyroid cancer . Sorafenib pill approve FDA treatment kidney liver cancer . Sorafenib may work many different way . It help decrease blood supply tumor . By , may limit tumor 's source oxygen nutrient prevent tumor grow . Everolimus oral medication FDA approve treatment kidney cancer . It inhibit protein kinase call mTOR ( `` mammalian Target Rapamycin '' ) . In laboratory study , addition everolimus sorafenib work well sorafenib alone . These two drug use together treat type cancer clinical study . In addition , cancer evaluate help u find factor help predict would benefit combination drug .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must histopathologically confirm MSKCC thyroid carcinoma . Patient must agree allow 2 biopsy malignant lesion access ultrasound ( e.g. , cervical lymph node , peripheral nodule ) without aid radiology ( i.e. , skin lesion ) Patients must surgically inoperable and/or recurrent/metastatic disease . Patients must PET scan prior protocol start date least one FDGavid lesion remove surgically radiate ( unless progress RECIST criterion completion radiation therapy still FDGavid ) . FDGavidity define focus increase FDG uptake great normal activity SUV maximum level great equal 3 . PET scan do time prior start therapy , although recommend do within 3 month prior start therapy . Patients must measurable disease RECIST criterion , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan ; perform ≤ 4 week protocol start date . Patients must progressive disease define least one follow occur previous treatment ( include RAI treatment ) unless newly diagnose : The presence new progressive lesion CT/MRI . New lesion bone scan PET scan . Rising thyroglobulin level ( document minimum three consecutive rise , interval &gt; 1 week determination ) . Prior RAI therapy allow &gt; 3 month prior initiation therapy protocol evidence progression ( define ) document interim . A diagnostic study use &lt; 10 mCi RAI consider RAI therapy . Patients may receive prior external beam radiation therapy index lesion ≥ 4 week prior initiation therapy protocol document progression RECIST criterion . Prior external beam radiation therapy nonindex lesion allow ≥ 4 week prior initiation therapy protocol . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/dl Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN ( unless increase due indirect bilirubin Gilbert 's disease ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional ULN unless liver metastasis present . AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 5 X institutional ULN liver metastasis present . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 X institutional ULN OR Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level 1.5 X institutional ULN [ circumstance , either measure level base 24 hour urine collection , calculate level use Cockcroft Gault equation : ( 140 age year ) X ( weight kg ) X ( 0.85 female ) /72 X serum Cr may use ] . International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 ( range INR , usually 2 3 , patient stable dose therapeutic warfarin ) . ULN = upper limit normal Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Age 18 year old old . Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma present biopsy fine needle aspirate specimen previous year , unless pathologist MSKCC disagree diagnosis . Previous treatment know mTOR inhibitor ( e.g. , everolimus , temsirolimus ) sorafenib thyroid cancer . Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , etc . ) Patients , major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) patient may require major surgery course study Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients known history active intraparenchymal brain metastasis within previous 3 month . Previously treat lesion eligible either surgically remove indication metastatic disease image brain progression treatment least 6 month . Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day treatment . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 sorafenib ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease define follow : History CVA within past 6 month Myocardial infarction , CABG unstable angina within past 6 month New York Heart Association grade III great congestive heart failure Canadian Cardiovascular Class grade III great angina within past 6 month ( Appendices A &amp; B ) Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease within past 6 month Pulmonary embolism , DVT , thromboembolic event within past 6 month Uncontrolled coronary artery disease , angina , congestive heart failure , ventricular arrhythmia require acute medical management within past 6 month History myocardial infarct , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic event within past 6 month liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . While use AngiotensinConverting Enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor absolutely exclude , effort make see patient ACE inhibitor take medication switch another medication . Patients active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . If barrier contraceptive use , must continue throughout trial sex . Hormonal contraceptives acceptable sole method contraception . ( Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior administration RAD001 ) Patients know hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients . History noncompliance medical regimen Patients unwilling unable comply protocol A known history HIV seropositivity The use agent inhibit induce CYP3A metabolism strictly prohibit , avoid possible . Potential CYP3A induce agent include carbamazepine , phenytoin , barbiturate , rifabutin , rifampicin , St. John 's Wort . Potential CYP3A inhibitor include protease inhibitor , antifungal , macrolide antibiotic , nefazodone , selective serotonin inhibitor .</criteria>
