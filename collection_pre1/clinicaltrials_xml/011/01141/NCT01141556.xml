	<detailed_description>Selenium essential micronutrient present form selenocysteine many enzyme . Selenoenzymes play major role protect cell lipid peroxidation involve inflammatory response regulation . The degree selenium deficiency correlate disease severity incidence mortality . Different study show selenium supplementation beneficial effect critically ill patient systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) , reduce rate infectious complication length hospital stay . Heart surgery associate complex systemic inflammatory response extent correlate development postoperative complication . Former clinical trial use selenium supplementation load dose normally 1000 2000 μg , follow daily dosage 1000 μg . With dosage regime pharmacological investigation demonstrate delayed increase selenium concentration plasma whole blood . As result delay increase selenoenzymes assume . Aim study evaluate , high dosis selenium supplementation ( load dose 4000 μg , daily dosage 1000 μg ) result significant reduction inflammation-induced organ dysfunction length ICU-stay patient heart surgery . Primary endpoint : Clinical outcome quantify use Sequential Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA ) Score length ICU stay hour . Secondary endpoint : incidence acute renal failure , total requirement vasoconstrictor fluid replacement therapy Inclusion criterion : write informed consent , male female age ≥ 18 year , patient undergo elective heart surgery , normal renal function ( serum creatinine ≤ 200 μmol/l ) Exclusion criterion : pregnancy , lack write concent , emergency operation</detailed_description>
