	<brief_summary>The overall median survival nonresectable malignant hilar obstruction series le 6 month . Most patient malignant hilar obstruction present advance disease , make allative endoscopic drainage principal therapeutic option . However , optimal endoscopic management strategy contentious . In malignant hilar obstruction , exclusively endoscopic placement bilateral metal stent consider difficult complex , may require multiple procedure , increase risk complication mortality . To overcome difficulty strategize plan management , investigator evaluate technical clinical efficacy endoscopic bilateral placement newly design stent , Y-configuration , follow side-by-side insertion failure stent-in-stent method management malignant hilar obstruction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Two Bilateral Metal Stenting Hilar Malignancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Stent-in-stent ( SIS ) placement Following negotiation intrahepatic bile duct ( IHD ) two guidewires , insert 1st stent leave IHD side . The central portion 1st stent cross right-side guide wire access contralateral ductal system across central cross-wired portion use right-side guide wire target . After deployment 1st stent across hilar stricture , remain guide wire across 1st stent carefully withdraw use ERCP catheter without pull back completely . Then guidewie insert fluoroscopic guidance undrained right IHD central portion 1st stent . The 2nd cross-wired stent introduce guidewire central open mesh deploy right IHD , central portion 2nd stent overlap central portion 1st stent , form Y-shape . If selective insertion guide wire leave IHD difficult first , guidewire 1st stent insert right IHD first attempt make insert guide wire stent leave IHD . If contralateral guide wire cannulation fail 1st stent placement , stricture dilate 4 6 mm use balloon catheter ( Hurricane biliary balloon dilatation catheter ; Boston Scientific ) guide wire . Alternatively , second intervention contralateral stent placement allow 2-3 day expansion 1st endoscopic stent . 2 . Side-by-side ( SBS ) placement Bilateral SBS stent placement perform follow . The stricture first negotiate insert guidewire IHD use method . Following introduction two guidewires , first stent push deploy left hepatic duct possible , subsequently second stent push deploy right hepatic duct , use method . During deployment first stent , second stent preloaded guidewire facilitate bilateral SBS stent placement . Endoscopic dilatation stricture deployment stent routinely perform primary procedure . In tight stricture guidewire manipulation , pneumatic biliary balloon dilation prior insertion first stent perform . All stent position level papilla , distal end level possible . The diameter stent use case ( 8 10 mm ) depend maximum diameter common bile duct ( CBD ) .</detailed_description>
