	<brief_title>An Observational Study Comparing Multiple Sclerosis International Quality Life Questionnaire ( MusiQoL ) Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life-54 Instrument ( MSQOL-54 ) Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis ( RMS ) Patients Long-term RebifÂ® Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis chronic , inflammatory , demyelinate disease central nervous system ( CNS ) one common cause neurological disability young adult . The neuropathology disease mark accumulation leukocyte CNS , oligodendrocyte loss , demyelination , axonal atrophy , neuronal loss . Clinically characterize multi-focal recurrent attack neurological symptom sign variable recovery eventually , majority subject develop progressive clinical course MS . The exact cause MS unknown , although autoimmune process implicate . Genetic susceptibility play role disease initiation unidentified environmental factor may also involve . Three clinical form MS recognize : primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( PPMS ) , secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( SPMS ) RRMS . Primary progressive subject characterize slow steady accumulation neurological deficit onset without superimposed attack . Subjects RRMS exacerbation relapse subsequent variable recovery ( remission ) . Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis characterize steady accumulation significant persistent neurological deficit without superimposed relapse . The concept quality life ( QoL ) define World Health Organization ( WHO ) individual 's perception life within cultural context value system live , respect objective , expectation , norm worry . It complex broad concept , influence various level subject 's physical health state , psychological health state , level independence , social relation relationship overall surrounding environment . A critical element HRQoL reflect subject 's assessment impact his/her illness , physician 's perspective . Professional interest concept QoL increase course past year , particularly within framework health care program chronic disease . Health related quality life measure subdivide generic disease-specific measure . Generic measure design assess subject diverse medical condition may capture relevant aspect specific illness . However , disease-specific measure develop generic HRQoL tool may truly reflect perspective subject specific disease . The MusiQoL questionnaire subject focus questionnaire develop independent scientific steer committee conjunction MS subject , neurologist , health economist since 2000 . OBJECTIVES - To assess usefulness MusiQoL clinical practice comparison establish disease specific QoL instrument MSQOL-54 - To evaluate effectiveness Rebif therapy respect HRQoL longitudinal study subject RMS This observational , one arm , multicentric study . Quality life data MusiQoL instrument MSQOL-54 questionnaire , well physical health outcome EDSS , collect bi-annually subject RMS .</detailed_description>
