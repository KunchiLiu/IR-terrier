	<brief_summary>Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) increasingly popular therapy option treat small kidney cancer , especially patient ideal candidate traditional surgery . Currently , follow-up procedure involve patient several CT scan ( MRI scan case ) time monitor possible cancer recurrence . However , risk associate radiation exposure CT scan risk , adverse event contrast medium use scan . This study therefore investigate whether different technique , contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CEUS ) , effective tool follow-up monitoring kidney cancer patient undergone RFA compare result standard follow-up CT scan ( MRIs applicable ) result CEUS . If CEUS find effective CT scan MRIs detect kidney cancer recurrence , technique could potentially become new standard care follow-up .</brief_summary>
