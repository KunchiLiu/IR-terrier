	<detailed_description>SUMMARY PURPOSE : The purpose study develop biomarkers central nervous system BH4 concentration child autism easily screen determine may benefit BH4 supplementation . Kuvan synthetic form BH4 . BH4 enzyme cofactor essential several critical metabolic function . Procedures : Consented subject ' behavior , particularly irritability , cognitive language function assess baseline make sure subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Parents subject instruct give subject 20 mg/kg/day KuvanÂ® orally dissolve 4 - 8oz . water apple juice breakfast . Subjects permit start new supplement treatment study period allow continue previous supplement . Subjects permit take counter medication prescription medication acute illness . Evaluation subject include three clinic visit neuropsychological clinical testing , completion study-related questionnaire telephone follow-up visit . Course Study : Subjects study 16 week . Enrollment : The study enroll 20 ( male female ) subject , 2-6 year old , delays language and/or social development . Vulnerable population include child . A pediatric risk assessment complete Ian Butler , MD outcome minimum risk subject . Recruitment : Subjects recruit parent present care University Texas medically-based autism clinic . Known Risks : For study drug Kuvan , rare association gastroesophageal reflux previous form compound associate seizure individual take Levodopa concurrently . There risk loss confidentiality . Data Safety Monitoring : A DSMB form study . The PI responsible data safety study . Informed Consent : A write parental inform consent form submit review approval . There cost participation , remuneration . Confidentiality maintain use unique study code . IND # : A request pre-IND meeting FDA discus possible IND exemption submit . Funding Source : This study fund BioMarin Pharmaceuticals .
