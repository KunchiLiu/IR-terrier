	<brief_summary>This project pilot study design investigate transcriptional regulation breast cancer . Although main focus present study triple negative breast cancer clinically relevant receptor - estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) herceptin ( HER2 ) - absent , breast tissue biospecimens , include normal mammary dysplasia , store UAMS Tissue bank , procure outside collaborator purchase commercial vendor eventually investigate . We use high throughput molecular profile technique microarrays next generation sequence correlate gene expression gene expression regulation clinical parameter tumor size , time relapse overall survival .</brief_summary>
