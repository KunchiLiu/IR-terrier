	<brief_title>The Weight-Wise Weight Loss Translation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low-income woman US high rate overweight obesity , put increase risk diabetes , heart disease , chronic illness . Because mean body mass index gradually increase adult life peak 50-59 year age , low income woman 40-64 year group deserve special attention . While sufficient evidence behavioral weight management intervention effective produce clinically meaningful level weight loss reduction cardiovascular risk factor delay onset diabetes , research gap translate efficacious intervention real life setting diverse population group . Research seek translate effective behavioral weight management intervention resource-intensive efficacy trial long-term adoption implementation public health setting serve diverse low-income population timely great public health significance . This translational research provide important information decision-makers evidence-based intervention delivery , resource allocation , workforce preparation . The overall goal propose research evaluate process outcomes translating research practice intense , evidence-based behavioral weight loss intervention demonstrate effectiveness among midlife low-income woman . Originally study single coordinate community health care center/church set deliver research staff ( Weight-Wise Pilot Study ) , evaluate translation test effectiveness intervention implement exist staff range county health department support local community resource . To evaluate translation process , use RE-AIM framework , diffusion innovation theory , systematic model adaptation ass : 1 ) factor related reach ; contextual setting-specific factor necessary successful adoption implementation ; 2 ) effectiveness facilitator train stakeholder collaboration ; 3 ) adaptation fidelity implementation ; 4 ) cost associate implementation outcome . To test intervention 's effectiveness , enroll 240 overweight obese low-income woman , 40-64 year age , 6 representative public health agency . Participants randomize receive 16-week behavioral weight loss intervention ( special intervention group ) usual care ( wait list control group ) . The primary study outcome 5 month follow-up weight change ; secondary outcome include change blood pressure , dietary intake , physical activity , quality life measure .</detailed_description>
