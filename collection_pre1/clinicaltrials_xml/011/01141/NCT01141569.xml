	<brief_title>A Study RO4929097 Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma That Have Failed Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) /Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor ( VEGFR ) Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response rate RO4929097 patient advance kidney cancer failure anti-VEGF directed therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumor activity RO4929097 secondary endpoint include : duration radiologic response , rate disease stabilization , rate tumor control rate ( CR+PR+SD ) , progression-free &amp; overall survival rate . II . To assess safety tolerability single agent RO4929097 patient advance RCC . III . To explore expression Notch biomarkers RCC patient potential interaction RO4929097 response toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 12 month .</detailed_description>
