	<brief_summary>Some group report sniffer dog apply detect lung cancer exhale breath patient . Therefore , breath sample ( BS ) patient collect . Five sniffer dog train distinguish BS patient lung cancer healthy individual ( control ) . In prospective , randomize blind study dog 's ability differentiate BS ) patient lung cancer , ii ) patient inflammatory airway disease , evidence cancer iii ) healthy individual test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Detection Lung Tumors Sniffer Dogs - Evaluation Sensitivity Specificity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All breath sample ( BS ) collect patient basis radiologic finding intervention ( bronchoscopy , biopsy surgery ) perform . The allocation study group make follow diagnostic work surgery . Three study group define use follow inclusion exclusion criterion : - lung cancer : male &amp; female , age 18-80 , competent , confirm lung cancer diagnostic work surgery , history present tumor disease - healthy individual : male &amp; female , age 18-80 , competent , history present tumor disease include lung cancer , pathological lung function test - chronic obstructive lung disease : male &amp; female , age 18-80 , competent , history present tumor disease include lung cancer , pathological lung function test For patient , ) history , ii ) present medication , iii ) lung function test document . For lung cancer patient , tumor stage follow surgery document . Five sniffer dog train use BS lung cancer patient healthy individual . After completion training ability dog differentiate group test : - 5 BS present 1 experiment : - Test I : lung cancer v healthy individual - Test II : lung cancer v chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - Test III : lung cancer v healthy individual &amp; bronchitis - every experiment 1 BS lung cancer patient use - lung cancer sample place randomly one five test tube - test tube use BS healthy individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patient - neither dog handler dog know load test tube - experiment repeat 5 10 time For analysis , sensitivity specificity dog 's reaction determine . The patient 's medication , smoke habit , age gender analyse rule confounders bias .</detailed_description>
