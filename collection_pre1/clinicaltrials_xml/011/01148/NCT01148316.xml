Fluoxetine administer drop capsule , dose range 10 80mg/day . Group CBT deliver weekly , 2-hour session , group 6 8 participant . At end treatment ( week 14 28 ) , treatment response assess blind raters , YBOCS CGI-global improvement subscale . Response define least 35 % reduction baseline YBOCS score CGI score 1 2 .
