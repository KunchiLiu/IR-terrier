	<brief_title>The Role Cardiac Biomarkers Prediction Outcome Atrial Fibrillation Patients Undergoing Catheter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AF common arrhythmia clinical practice , affect &gt; 2.3 million people US . It increase dramatically age see many 9 % individual age 80 ( 1 ) . A major cause stroke , AF also associate 2-fold increase mortality ( 1 ) . Symptomatic AF demonstrate consistently associate elevated inflammatory activity atrial tissue evidence fact AF occur 40 % patient follow cardiac bypass surgery 50 % patient undergoing valvular surgery ( 2 ) . Recent study also demonstrate elevated CRP level increase risk AF 31 % ( 2 ) . Oxidative damage experience AF lead myocardial necrosis turn induce low-grade inflammation result eventual fibrosis atrial myocardium . Thus , inflammation responsible adverse structural electrical remodel cardiac tissue perpetuate existence , maintenance , recurrence arrhythmia . Radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) evolve promising curative therapy drug-refractory AF . However , recurrence AF RFCA common clinical problem , occur 25-50 % patient follow-up period ( 3 ) patient undergo multiple ablation procedure cure arrhythmia . Published retrospective study demonstrate systemic inflammation generate AF ablation associate few early arrhythmia recurrence ( 4 ) . Therefore , measurement inflammatory marker within 24 hour RFCA could helpful exploration association degree inflammatory activation procedure outcome . Systemic inflammatory activation characterize increase circulating level several biomarkers prolong period . Thus , examination biomarkers 3-months post-procedure may provide critical insight understand role inflammation achievement long-term success catheter ablation AF patient . Rules-Based Medicine , Inc ( RBM ) 3300 Duval Road Austin , TX 78759 develop biomarker panel validate detect early sign inflammation . RBM process blood sample preliminary panel ~40 biomarkers presume possible predictor procedural outcome RFCA AF patient .</detailed_description>
