	<brief_summary>Background : - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) , commonly know ecstasy , synthetic psychoactive drug show steep increase recreational use abuse young people recent year . Research study report chronic MDMA user also consume legal illegal substance show memory deficit ; however , combination drug often involve , difficult determine MDMA contribution effect . - Only study examine immediate physical behavioral effect MDMA give dose level commonly use young adult . Researchers interested use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) examine change brain activity function MDMA user compare user drug non-drug-using individual . Objectives : - To evaluate effect MDMA think brain function . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 30 year age ( 1 ) current user MDMA ( 2 ) , current drug user use MDMA , ( 3 ) healthy non-drug-using volunteer . Design : - Participants complete one training session three scanning session . - Before start study , participant complete questionnaire medical psychological history , provide information past current drug use . Researchers introduce task perform scan session ( ) , allow participant practice test . - Participants provide urine , saliva , hair sample test start study , multiple time scan session . - Participants use MDMA participant use drug stay overnight clinical center prior scan session . Participants use drug spend night prior scan arrive clinical center morning scan session . - Participants use MDMA receive either MDMA placebo scan session , tell one receive . Because nature MDMA , participant require stay clinical center effect drug worn , require return clinical center follow day follow-up examination . - During study , participant ask one task select researcher . The task perform computer MRI machine , may involve receive monetary reward action , memory reaction-time test , test involve respond instruction screen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) , commonly know ecstasy , synthetic compound show steep increase abuse young people recent year . In animal , high multiple dos MDMA give , serotonergic toxicity observe . Clinically , number severe ecstasy related acute toxicity low relation extent recreational use . Data retrospective study report memory deficit abstinent chronic user often abuse MDMA illicit licit substance ; therefore , difficult determine MDMA contribution observe cognitive deficit . There prospective control MDMA human administration study describe acute physiological behavioral effect follow dos commonly use young adult . We propose functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study examine specific change brain activity cognitive performance correlate change plasma MDMA concentration . Goals : The primary goal identification MDMA effect human brain function elucidation relationship effect plasma MDMA concentration . We propose within-subject design change memory , attention , affect , semantic processing decision-making performance follow placebo two recreational MDMA dose simultaneous fMRI monitor plasma collection . Secondly , pharmacokinetic data collect disposition MDMA metabolites plasma , urine , oral fluid , sweat , breath , hair . These data need accurately interpret drug concentration alternative biological matrix order drug test function deterrent drug use drug abuse treatment , law enforcement , military , workplace drug test program . Pharmacokinetic data also enable drug test serve valid diagnostic tool emergency medicine public safety setting , well useful objective outcome measure treatment research . Subject Population : Eighteen current MDMA user complete neurocognitive pharmacokinetics group . Thirty-six MDMA non-using control include 18 non-drug use participant 18 drug use ( primarily cannabis ) participant . Controls group match MDMA user neurocognitive pharmacokinetics group . All participant must age 18 40 . The estimated target enrollment , base ecstasy use race/ethnic group Baltimore demographic , 41 % female 59 % male , 83 % Caucasian , 14 % African American , 3 % Asian , 2 % Hispanic . Experimental Design Methods : A randomized , balance , double blind , within-subject drug administration study placebo , low ( 1.0 mg/kg , approximately 70 mg ) high ( 1.6 mg/kg , approximately 112 mg ) dose MDMA propose . The non-drug use drug use control group match MDMA user neurocognitive pharmacokinetics group sex , age , IQ , education level intersession interval . The drug use control group control cannabis drug usage MDMA group . The drug use control group necessary many MDMA user also use drug , primarily cannabis . Control group allow between-subjects analysis trait difference population group , well provide normative data cognitive task . Drug use control group participant stay clinical research unit overnight prior three session ; non-drug use control group participant arrive morning session . Participants MDMA group complete three separate stay , last approximately 26 hour , within one year . While influence MDMA , qualify participant perform memory , attention , semantic processing , affect decision-making task , , fMRI scanning . Physiological , behavioral biochemical measure MDMA user monitor throughout study determine onset , magnitude duration pharmacodynamic effect . Blood , urine , oral fluid , sweat , breath , hair specimen collect MDMA user analysis MDMA metabolite concentration GC/MS and/or LC/MS/MS determine disposition pharmacokinetics MDMA . Risks Benefits : A main potential risk study associate acute cardiovascular response MDMA administration ; however , dos prove safe well tolerate previous human study conduct within US abroad . In addition , impaired cognitive function report follow long-term MDMA use study . A potential benefit propose study understand MDMA affect human brain function dose employ recreational user . Additionally , advance make understand MDMA pharmacokinetics .</detailed_description>
