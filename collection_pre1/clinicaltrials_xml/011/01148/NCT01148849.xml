	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine MGAH22 safe give intravenous ( IV ) infusion patient HER2-positive cancer . The study also evaluate long MGAH22 stay blood long take leave body , high dose safely give , whether effect tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study MGAH22 HER2-positive Carcinomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label , multi-dose , single-arm , multi-center , Phase 1 , dose-escalation study conduct define toxicity profile , MTD , PK , immunogenicity , potential antitumor activity MGAH22 patient refractory HER2 positive breast cancer patient carcinomas overexpress HER2 standard therapy available . After MTD define , additional cohort patient treat MTD obtain information regard safety choose dose , definitively describe PK , evaluate potential anti-tumor activity MGAH22 . Patients monitor minimum four week administration final dose MGAH22 . The National Cancer Institute 's ( NCI 's ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , v.4.0 , use grade AEs except note within protocol . Study assessment include AE monitoring , ECG monitoring , PK analysis serum MGAH22 , determination serum concentration soluble MGAH22 tumor marker , assessment potential anti-MGAH22 antibody [ human anti-chimeric antibody ( HACA ) ] response . Tumor response assessment use Study Day 43 CT scan perform approximately six week first MGAH22 dose patient . Patients evidence disease regression ( partial complete response stable disease RECIST criterion ) allow continue therapy dose , reduce dose warrant DLT significant AE Cycle 1 . Subsequent cycle begin Study Day 50 consist MGAH22 administration Study Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle , tumor evaluation every cycle . Responding patient may receive continue antibody therapy evidence progression disease document patient experience DLT .</detailed_description>
