	<brief_summary>The influence gene addictive neuropsychiatric disorder complex , especially give multiple gene likely influence certain behavior correlate addiction . Researchers interested look genetic information individual enrol National Institute Drug Abuse study investigate specific genetic variant may relate substance abuse . Researchers study effect gene several aspect think attention , memory , decision making , problem solving , learning , emotional feeling , investigate way genetic information affect addictive behavior substance abuse . In addition , researcher study gene may explain difference image data substance user . Objectives : - To collect genetic information research genetic aspect addiction substance abuse . Eligibility : - Adolescents adults 13 55 year age ( 1 ) healthy , non-drug-using nonsmoker , ( 2 ) healthy smoker , ( 3 ) healthy individual dependent commonly abused drug , ( 4 ) individual psychiatric disorder . - Participants must right-handed , must enrol another National Institute Drug Abuse , Intramural Research Program imaging protocol . Design : - This study involve one two visit National Institute Drug Abuse , Intramural Research Program may separate participant current research protocol study visit day visit . . - Participants provide blood sample complete questionnaire mood , memory , learn . - Participants may also ask task , play computer game involve coin toss money management , respond question computer screen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine genetic variant well behavioral measure across different study group population . Results use regressors help explain inter-individual difference data collect across IRP protocol . Study Population : The study population include 1 ) healthy non-smoking , non-drug dependent participant 2 ) healthy nicotine-dependent individual 3 ) healthy individual dependent commonly abuse drug 4 ) individual psychiatric disorder 5 ) treatment-seeking individual dependent nicotine commonly abuse drug . Participants must eligible schedule another NIDA-IRP protocol , generally healthy , age 13 old . Design : This study require 1 visit ( approximately 4-6 hour ) NIDA-IRP , may conjunction another NIDA-IRP study . The characterization instrument divide two section : Common Instruments Additional Instruments . Common Instruments include instrument common do similar protocol NIAAA . All participant complete instrument along blood sample , Delayed Discounting task MRI scan . The completion item define completer protocol . Subjects option complete study multiple visit choose . After consent study , participant ask submit blood sample , complete various questionnaire , characterization instrument several behavioral task . Blood drawn , provide technical problem ( sample damage collection , preparation , ship assay ) require repeat draw . Participants one NIDA-IRP protocol ask repeat time-sensitive questionnaire protocol subsequent MRI visit , require IRP image protocol subject may participate . Data acquire protocol compare data acquire NIDA-IRP protocol . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure study genetic , behavioral phenotypic factor related addiction . Secondary outcome measure compare genetic , behavioral phenotypic factor image behavioral data acquire across IRP protocol .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant must : 1. eligible already enrol NIDAIRP study . 2 . Greater equal 13 year age . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Not consent NIDA IRP image protocol . Exclusion criterion limit NIDA IRP image protocol subject consent . Exclusion MRI portion : 1 . History neurological illness include limited CVA , CNS tumor , head trauma , MS demyelinate disease , epilepsy , movement disorder , migraine treatment . 2 . Cognitive impairment ( unless population subject include another IRP protocol subject also participate ) . 3 . Current major mood , anxiety psychotic disorder ( unless population subject include another IRP protocol subject also participate ) . 4 . Pregnancy . 5 . HIV 6 . Unable undergo MRI scan due possible pregnancy , metallic device body , claustrophobia body morphometry . 7 .
