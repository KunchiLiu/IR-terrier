	<brief_summary>Reliable endotracheal tube ( ETT ) insertion confirmation essential critically ill patient . Incorrect placement cause high rate mortality morbidity . Therefore , early detection accidental esophageal intubation must primary focus emergency airway effort emergency department ( ED ) . Although many technique suggest verify ETT placement , currently entirely reliable method . Ultrasonography ( US ) indispensable easily accessible tool ED . Several study ultrasonographic confirmation ETT position provide promising result cadaver model patient control operating room setting.In study , investigator propose protocol call T.R.U.E , acronym tracheal rapid ultrasound exam , confirm ETT position emergency intubation . This method provide fast , real-time examination prevent esophageal endotracheal intubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tracheal Rapid Ultrasound Exam ( T.R.U.E ) Confirming Endotracheal Tube Placement Emergency Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Establishing definite airway , endotracheal tube placement , important component resuscitation . A high rate morbidity mortality report unrecognized esophageal intubation . Therefore , early detection esophageal intubation essential emergency airway management . There several method use endotracheal tube confirmation , auscultation breathe sound , chest X-ray capnography.2 However , method false-negative rate entirely reliable resuscitation . Ultrasound indispensable easily accessible tool emergency department . Recent study show ultrasound use confirm endotracheal tube placement cadaver model . In prospective study , investigate sensitivity specificity ultrasound endotracheal tube confirmation emergency intubation The study conduct emergency department National Taiwan University Hospital approve hospital institutional review board . During resuscitation , duty emergency resuscitation team performs intubation confirm endotracheal tube position auscultation end-tidal capnography . Meanwhile , researcher performs ultrasonography examination endotracheal tube position . A curvilinear ultrasonography transducer use place transversely anterior neck superior suprasternal notch bilateral hemithorax . The result ultrasonography compare auscultation , capnography chest X-ray . Sensitivity specificity ultrasonography examination compute determine accuracy effectiveness clinical use .</detailed_description>
