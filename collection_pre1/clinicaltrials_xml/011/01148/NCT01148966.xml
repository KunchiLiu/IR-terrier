	<brief_title>Aminolevulinic Acid During Surgery Treating Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I . Establish safe dose oral ALA administration . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I . Determine 3 ALA ( aminolevulinic acid ) dose ( 10 , 20 30 mg/kg ) provide optimal discrimination normal malignant tissue intraoperatively . II . Determine whether use ALA ( compare comparable case perform without aid ALA ) lead high rate gross total resection , determine postoperative MRI scanning within 48 hour surgery completion . III . Compare time-to-progression survival comparable case perform without aid ALA. OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally ( PO ) 4 hour undergoing surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 5 every 8-12 week 27 month .</detailed_description>
