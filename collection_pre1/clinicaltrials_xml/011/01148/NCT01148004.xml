	<brief_summary>Background : - Patients infected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) often treated protease inhibitor help fight HIV infection . However , medication often increase blood cholesterol level , particularly triglycerides low-density lipoprotein , lead heart disease problem . Patients may take drug know fibrates ( gemfibrozil ( Lopid ) ) low triglyceride level , even maximum approved dos patient often reach goal triglyceride level . Research suggest fibrates certain HIV medication , ritonavir lopinavir/ritonavir , may interact decrease effectiveness fibrate treatment . More research need determine best drug low triglyceride level HIV patient receive protease inhibitor therapy . Objectives : - To evaluate drug-drug interaction fenofibrate protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir ritonavir . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 60 year age . Design : - This study require screen visit 18 study visit . The screening visit take 3 4 hour , occur 7 30 day start study . The rest study , include screen visit , 48 day . Three visit take 12 hour , remain 15 visit take 1 hour . - For study day 1 7 , participant take fenofibrate alone . Participants keep daily record medication dose side effect . - For study day 8 27 , participant take fenofibrate ritonavir . Participants keep daily record medication dose side effect . - For study day 29 48 , participant take fenofibrate lopinavir/ritonavir . Participants keep daily record medication dose side effect . - Participants regular study visit provide blood sample research monitoring ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) enhance life expectancy human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infect patient , make HIV manageable chronic disease many patient . Patients HIV prone lipid abnormality secondary HIV infection antiretroviral therapy , particularly HIV protease inhibitor ( PI ) . PI contain regimen contain boost dos ritonavir ( RTV ) ( i.e. , 100 200 mg twice daily ) often cause significant increase total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride . Therapy isolate hypertriglyceridemia include fibric acid derivative , gemfibrozil ( GFZ ) fenofibrate ; however , despite treatment agent , triglyceride level often remain elevated HIV infect patient treated HAART . Many factor likely contribute incomplete effectiveness fibrates patient . One possible contribute factor may clinically significant interaction HAART fibrates . We recently report mean 41 percent decrease GFZ area curve administer PI combination lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) . To determine whether similar interaction exists fenofibrate , study characterize impact RTV LPV/r pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile fenofibrate ( Tricor formulation ) , single 145 mg oral dose , administer healthy volunteer . In single sequence study design , 13 subject receive single 145 mg dose fenofibrate three occasion : 14 day RTV 100 mg twice daily , 14 day LPV/r 400/100 mg twice daily . With exclusion screen period , total duration study 48 day . Fenofibric acid ( FFA ) PK determine 3 sample period compare . Results study inform u potentially clinically relevant drug drug interaction fenofibrate RTV boost PI combination . This information may therefore assist clinician choose triglyceride lower therapy HIV infect patient .</detailed_description>
