	<brief_summary>Background study : Many elderly suffer reduce exercise tolerance exercise induce shortness breath ( dyspnoea ) cause decreased mobility restriction physical , psychological social functioning . Patients commonly attribute symptom age , simply adjust life style . Reduced exercise tolerance/dyspnoea common prevalence rate 20-60 % age 65 year . The main causus elderly heart failure chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Both disease high negative impact quality life associate frequent hospital admission . Over-diagnosis , often under-diagnosis heart failure COPD rather common primary care . Establishing diagnosis early course disease useful diseases adequately evidence-based treat . Therefore , easy diagnostic triage-strategy follow bij direct treatment would great importance asses treat heart failure COPD elderly patient shortness breath . Objective study : Quantify many frail elderly age 65 year reduce exercise tolerance and/or exercise induce dyspnoea previously unrecognised COPD heart failure . Quantify difference prevalence unrecognised COPD heart failure underwent diagnostic triage compare receive care usual . Quantify effect diagnostic triage plus additionally treatment change functionality quality life 6 month compare receive care usual . Quantify cost-effectiveness diagnostic triage strategy compare care usual Study design : A clustered randomize diagnostic ( follow-up ) study Study population : First , pre-selection patient age 65 year 50 general practice base frailty . Frailty base next criterion : use 5 different type medical drug chronically last year and/or 3 chronic vitality treating disease ( diabetes mellitus , COPD , heart failure , impaired vision ) . This do electronic medical file general practice . These elderly receive MRC questionnaire dyspnoea three additional question relate tot exercise intolerance . Those dyspnoea and/or reduce exercise tolerance invite participate , except establish heart failure COPD . Study parameters/outcome study : Prevalence latent heart failure COPD . Difference prevalence latent heart failure COPD group . Differences functionality quality life 6 month group . Cost-effectiveness experienced patient burden diagnostic triage strategy .</brief_summary>
