	<detailed_description>Abnormalities blood vessel lung hallmark pulmonary hypertension . Links increase free radical production , mitochondrial dysfunction pulmonary hypertension study poorly understood . The mitochondrion cell location cellular energy create free radical atoms group atom odd ( unpaired ) number electron form oxygen interacts certain molecule . Once form reactive radical start chain reaction , like domino . Their chief danger come damage react important cellular component . Cells may function poorly die occurs . The body produce free radical normal course energy production pulmonary hypertension , free radical production find increase . To prevent free radical damage body defense system antioxidant . Coenzyme Q-10 antioxidant help protect cell damage cause body 's free radical . By provide oral supplementation coenzyme Q-10 , free radical level decrease cellular function pulmonary blood vessel may improve even return near normal functioning . The purpose study evaluate effect coenzyme Q-10 , antioxidant , treatment pulmonary hypertension . We assess coenzyme Q-10 supplementation treatment pulmonary hypertension clinical measurement blood level certain cellular component . We would like assess effect coenzyme Q-10 pulmonary vessel measure lung diffuse capacity ( breathe test ) exhale Nitric Oxide ( NO ) ( substance body relax dilate blood vessel ) . We also measure endothelial progenitor cell ( cell bone marrow ) blood sample ; cell marker measure blood vessel formation repair . We also measure activity superoxide dismutase ( protein cell execute breakdown free radical oxygen hydrogen peroxide ) blood . In addition , measure level coenzyme Q-10 blood . Other marker disease response therapy do include physical exam , BNP level ( blood marker correlate heart function ) , 6-minute walk echocardiography ( ultrasound heart ) . A total 60ml ( 5 tablespoon ) blood draw visit .</detailed_description>
