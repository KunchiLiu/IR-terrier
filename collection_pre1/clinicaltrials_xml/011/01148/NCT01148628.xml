	<brief_summary>This dose finding , open-label , uncontrolled , dose-escalation trial determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) Recommended Dose ( RD ) combination RAD001 ( escalate daily dose ) CaelyxTM ( fix dose ) patient advance solid tumor . Other purpose study : 1. define safety profile combination repeat administration 2. define hint antitumor activity , confirm subsequent disease-oriented expansion phase RD . 3. define pharmacokinetic profile combination</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-finding Study CAELYXTM RAD001 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>mTOR inhibitor new class target antitumor agent show interesting antitumor activity variety solid tumor , include prostate , soft tissue sarcoma , ovarian , endometrial , kidney , breast cancer . They also exert antiangiogenic effect almost devoid bone marrow toxicity single agent make suitable combination cytotoxic drug . Anthracyclines among used effective cytotoxic agent , solid tumor indication include , among others , breast , ovary , endometrial , prostate cancer . Liposomal Doxorubicin ( CaelyxTM ) could adequate replacement doxorubicin avoid potential side effect cardiotoxicity , alopecia , GI toxicity . Testing combination regimen include mTOR inhibitor anthracyclines tumor know sensitive compound high clinical interest worthwhile .</detailed_description>
