	<brief_summary>This study investigate short course radiation therapy use IMRT alternative standard chemo radiation prior study show method treatment potentially reduce fo side effect standard treatment , improve quality life , help control growth rectal cancer cell . IMRT type radiation use computer-generated image match radiation size shape tumor . Since intensity radiation beam control , radiation dose wrap around normal tissue allow study doctor deliver high dose radiation tumor less damage nearby healthy tissue . The purpose research study see impact treatment quality life , well see late side effect come participant complete treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Radiation treatment rectum give day , 5 day . Each radiation treatment take 20-30 minute . - The following procedure perform day 1 radiation treatment : physical examination , blood test quality life questionnaire . - During radiation treatment physical examination perform 5 day radiation treatment . A Quality Life Questionnaire administer last day radiation treatment . - Surgery perform within 3-14 day last day radiation treatment .</detailed_description>
