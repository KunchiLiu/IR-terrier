	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis responsible 1.5 million fracture $ 14 billion medical care cost annually ( U.S Dept Health Human Services data , 2006 ) . Down syndrome independent risk factor osteopenia/osteoporosis . Increases life expectancy well costly morbidity follow fracture reason investigation osteoporosis prevention population . Etiology low bone density presently unknown population may relate unique gene chromosome 21 alter biochemistry bone metabolism change gonadal , thyroid parathyroid function alter bone formation and/or resorption . There publish data measurement bone turnover marker Down syndrome population ; therefore measure accrue information compare Ts65Dn data , describe later protocol . This pilot study serve foundation large translational research grant address multiple issue regard pathogenesis , diagnosis treatment osteoporosis Down syndrome patient population Down syndrome mouse model ( Ts65Dn ) . The data potential improve fundamental understanding osteoporosis pathogenesis treatment Down syndrome patient potential application treatment general population .</detailed_description>
