	<detailed_description>Opioid dependence severe public health problem . Current effort taper individual opioid medication limit due high relapse rate lack efficacy relieve subjective symptom . Methadone substitution therapy might decrease criminal rate increase quality life individual opioid dependence , high drop-out rate continue use methadone major problem maintenance therapy opioid dependence . Studies pathogenesis opioid dependence additional behavior need focused attention . Dextromethorphan ( DM ) noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist proven safety record anti-tussive purpose . Previous study demonstrate DM may useful decrease crave animal ( Huang , et al. , 2003 ; Lue et al. , 2007 ) withdrawal tendency human opioid dependence . In recent study , DM report afford neuroprotection endotoxin-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity ( Li et al . 2005 ; Liu et al . 2003 ; Zhang et al . 2004 , 2005 ) might relate treatment additictive behavior . The purpose study examine whether DM able 1 ) reduce opioid tolerance decrease methadone use ; 2 ) reduce withdrawal symptom ; 3 ) decrease relapse rate opioid use , 4 ) effective treatment opioid dependence ( addictive behavior ) . This double-blinded , placebo-controlled , randomize , parallel group clinical research trial study . Subjects opioid dependence recruit two different source . One group come list current opioid user require stay methadone treatment ( opioid use group ) , second group come subject force discontinue opioid use one week ( opioid free group ) . In opioid use group , add-on DM placebo treatment proceed double-blind fashion 12 week complete structured diagnostic interview adjust methadone dose . In opioid free group , subject take one-week placebo wash-out period first admit double-blind DM/placebo 12 week . Both opioid use opioid free group examine weekly urine test opioid use assess crave scale completion structure diagnostic interview . We measure treatment response side effect clarify curative effect DM use double-blinded DM/placebo therapy design opioid use opioid free group . Several psychological examination , psychosocial questionnaire , test immune parameter , electrophysiological study genetic marker perform study . The interim analysis decording partial subject complete DM/placebo add-on treatment three month perform end first year .</detailed_description>
