	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat see well work give together radiation therapy follow maintenance therapy vorinostat treat young patient newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( brainstem tumor ) . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving vorinostat together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose vorinostat give concurrently radiation child newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) . II . To define describe toxicity vorinostat give concurrently radiation child newly diagnose DIPG . III . To determine , context phase I/II trial , anti-tumor activity combine vorinostat radiation , follow maintenance vorinostat twelve course , child newly diagnose DIPG , measure 12-month event-free survival ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . IV . To determine toxicity vorinostat 12 additional course completion vorinostat radiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) treatment , 2 week start vorinostat radiation , end radiation . II . To measure histone deacetylase 2 ( HDAC2 ) level ass histone acetylation PBMCs treatment , 2 week start vorinostat radiation , end radiation . III . To quantify deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair proteins NHEJ homologous recombination repair ( HHR ) pathways tumor either Western analysis immunohistochemistry , paraffin-embedded tumor available . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study vorinostat follow phase II study . Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-40 . Patients undergo 3-dimensional ( 3D ) conformal intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 day per week 6 week . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise vorinostat PO day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month .</detailed_description>
