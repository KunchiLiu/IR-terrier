	<brief_title>Brain Imaging Cocaine Craving Recreational Cocaine Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic cocaine exposure associate intensified broaden pattern neural reactivity cocaine cocaine cue ; prolong use also associate prefrontal abnormality response inhibition . Limited research suggest recreational cocaine use similar , attenuate , effect neural functioning . Unfortunately , little research directly compare cocaine dependent individual recreational cocaine user term neural reactivity cocaine cue response inhibition . Such comparison could help elucidate pathological neuroplasticity associate transition cocaine use dependence . The propose study assess neural reactivity cocaine cue response inhibition recreational cocaine user use fMRI . These data compare data baseline visit ongoing IRB approve investigation ( NCT00759473 ) cocaine dependent individual use experimental procedure propose study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instrument . Subjects must report use cocaine within past 3 month . Subjects may meet criterion abuse , dependence substance exception nicotine , marijuana alcohol . Use one follow method birth control female subject : birth control pill , barrier method ( diaphragm condom spermicide ) , surgical sterilization , use intrauterine contraceptive device , complete abstinence sexual intercourse . Subjects must live within 50mile radius research facility reliable transportation . Subjects must consent remain abstinent drug abuse ( except nicotine ) prior experiment . Subjects must righthanded . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . Subjects evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect heart rate skin conductance measurement . Subjects history current psychotic disorder may impact cue reactivity . Subjects unwilling unable maintain abstinence alcohol drug abuse ( except nicotine ) . Subjects meet DSMIV criterion substance dependence ( nicotine , marijuana , alcohol ) within past 60 day . Subjects may meet criterion cocaine dependence time . Subjects currently take Bblockers , antiarrhythmic agent , psychostimulants agent know interfere heart rate skin conductance monitoring . Subjects history epilepsy seizure disorder . Subjects significant liver impairment . The need maintenance acute treatment psychoactive medication include antiseizure medication could potentially interfere fMRI . Clinically significant psychiatric medical problem would impair participation limit ability participate scan . Persons ferrous metal implant pacemaker since fMRI use .</criteria>
