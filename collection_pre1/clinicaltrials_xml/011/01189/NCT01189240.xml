	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose RO4929097 see well work give together bevacizumab compare bevacizumab alone treat patient progressive recurrent malignant glioma . RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving RO4929097 together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Phase I Primary Objective : 1 . To assess safety profile R04929097 combination bevacizumab determine recommend Phase II dose R04929097 combination bevacizumab patient recurrent malignant glioma Secondary Objectives : 2 . To describe toxicity associate combination regimen 3 . To assess pharmacokinetics R04929097 combination bevacizumab Phase II I. Assess safety profile recommend phase II dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) combination bevacizumab patient recurrent malignant glioma . II . Assess progression-free survival 6 month patient treat regimen . III . Compare overall survival patient recurrent glioblastoma treat RO4929097 bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe toxicity associate regimen patient . II . Assess pharmacokinetics regimen patient . III . Estimate proportion patient alive progression-free survival 6 month patient treat RO4929097 bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone . IV . Evaluate safety tolerability regimens patient . V. Explore potential prognostic biomarkers glioma tissue baseline potential association Notch pathway inhibition . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive oral RO4929097 day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 ( day 2 3 15 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomized* 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral RO4929097 day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab arm I . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *If phase II single-arm study demonstrate effectiveness , proceed phase II randomize study . Some patient undergo blood sample collection pharmacokinetic study . Archived tumor tissue sample analyze potential biomarkers Notch pathway inhibition . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
