	<brief_summary>Cysteine-rich 61 ( Cyr61 ) , member `` CCN '' family , regulate cell migration , proliferation , apoptosis , angiogenesis , cell adhesion , migration , proliferation , survival , differentiation , apoptosis , angiogenesis , extracellular matrix production . Evidences show strong correlation aberrant Cyr61 expression cancer numerous organ tissue . However , expression effect Cyr61 transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) , common urinary tract cancer Taiwan , remain undiscovered . Based previous study Cyr61 cancer , investigator hypothesize Cyr61 may mediate TCC cell proliferation migration ; associate disease progression recurrent . Thus investigator conduct project study role Cyr61 pathogenesis TCC . The investigator retrospectively review medical history patient TCC treat institute . Cyr61 immunohistochemical stain surgical sample perform . The correlation Cyr61 expression TCC patient ' clinical course investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Patients : show inclusion criterion 2 . Surgical sample Surgical specimen include patient TCC underwent surgery collect . The sample examine histologically presence tumor cell . Independent pathologist blind record patient perform histological examination . Tumor grade determine basis cytological feature . There three grade TCC , propose Mostofi et al . adopt American Bladder Tumor Registry World Health Organization . These base degree anaplasia : Grade 1 tumor show mild cytological atypia rare mitosis ; Grade 2 tumor show moderate cytological atypical presence mitotic figure ; Grade 3 tumor show severe cytological atypia frequent mitotic figure . Lymph node metastasis , lymphatic invasion , venous invasion evaluate pathology report image study . Clinical stag TCC base American Joint Committee Cancer stag ( AJCC ) TNM system . 3 . Immunohistochemical stain Paraffin-embedded , formalin-fixed surgical specimen collect Cyr61 immunohistochemical staining . Heat-induced epitope retrieval perform pressure cooker TRIS buffer ( pH 9.0 ) 2 min . They allow cool 15 min , rinse distilled water twice PBS 5 min . The section treat 0.5 % hydrogen peroxidase/PBS 20 min room temperature block endogenous peroxidase . They subsequently block 10 % normal goat serum 30 min room temperature , incubated polyclonal anti-Cyr61 antibody ( Santa Cruz , CA ) 4Â°C overnight . The specific antibody omit section negative control . The section wash three time PBS/0.2 % Triton X-100 10 min incubate biotin-conjugated secondary antibody ( DAKO , Carpinteria , CA ) 1 hour room temperature follow day . They incubate avidin-biotin-peroxidase reagent ( DAKO ) another 1 hour room temperature . After three wash PBS/0.2 % Triton X-100 10 min , reaction section detect peroxidase substrate contain diaminobenzidine chromagen ( DAKO ) . The slide counterstained hematoxylin . If &gt; 50 % tumor cell positively stain , specimen group `` positive '' . All stain result regard negative . 4 . Statistical analysis For statistical analysis , P value base two-sided , parametric Student 's test . A P value &lt; 0.05 basis least three independent set experiment consider statistically significant . In clinical set project , Chi-squire test Student 's test use study association Cyr61 expression single clinical factor ( age , gender , pathology , grade ) . Kaplan-Meier survival curve patient positive versus negative Cyr61 expression plot log-rank test use compare equality two survival curve . Cox proportional hazard model also develop correlate clinical characteristic , survival , expression Cyr61 .</detailed_description>
