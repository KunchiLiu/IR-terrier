	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety determine optimal dose new drug , demcizumab ( OMP-21M18 ) , give combination carboplatin pemetrexed , standard drug treatment regimen non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Participants must receive prior chemotherapy NSCLC . Demcizumab humanize monoclonal antibody ( protein make laboratory ) develop target cancer stem cell . The way body handle demcizumab also investigate . Up 50 subject enrol 8 center Australia , New Zealand , Spain . Up 28 day ( 4 week ) prior treatment undergo test determine eligibility take part study , enrol study receive intravenous ( vein ) infusion demcizumab , carboplatin , pemetrexed administer day , every 21 day 4 cycle , show cancer progress . If physician decides delay treatment one agent due side effect , agent may still administer schedule . After 4 cycle , stable improve disease , continue receive pemetrexed every 21 day maintenance therapy . You undergo assessment every 8 week determine status disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Carboplatin Pemetrexed Plus Demcizumab ( OMP-21M18 ) Subjects With Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current cancer therapy often produce initial reduction tumour size may longterm benefit . One possible explanation presence cancer cell know cancer stem cell . Cancer stem cell represent small part tumour believe responsible much growth spread cancer . They may also resistant traditional therapy , chemotherapy radiation therapy . Up 50 subject enrol 8 center Australia , New Zealand , Spain . Up 28 day ( 4 week ) prior treatment undergo test determine eligibility take part study , enrol study receive intravenous ( vein ) infusion demcizumab , carboplatin , pemetrexed administer day , every 21 day 4 cycle , show cancer progress . If physician decides delay treatment one agent due side effect , agent may still administer schedule . After 4 cycle , stable improve disease , continue receive pemetrexed every 21 day maintenance therapy . You undergo assessment every 8 week determine status disease . In addition routine test blood urine ( complete blood count differential platelet , coagulation study determine quickly blood clotting ; serum chemistry ; B-type natriuretic peptide [ BNP ] Troponin I , indicate well heart work ; creatinine clearance measure kidney function urinalysis ) , special test perform study specific time point . In addition , ECG doppler echocardiogram perform screening , every 28 day study treatment termination . Your Doppler echocardiogram may send Cardiologist another hospital may perform central read doppler echocardiogram study . Finally , head CT MRI baseline CT scan and/or radiograph perform every 56 day assess status tumor . The study include optional part investigate variation people 's genetic makeup affect response medication . This involve collection one blood sample participant receive first dose study treatment . DNA extract blood sample testing .</detailed_description>
