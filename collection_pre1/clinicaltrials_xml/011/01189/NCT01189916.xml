	<brief_summary>Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) revolutionize concept minimally invasive surgery . NOTES currently perform transgastric transvaginal approach . The transvaginal approach technically easy , available woman . A transrectal approach propose potential alternative transvaginal NOTES men . Fortunately , technology facilitate transrectal access closure NOTES use twenty year , form transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( TEM ) platform . We hypothesize transrectal NOTES appendectomy feasible human use flexible endoscope TEM platform assist transrectal access closure . After pre-clinical study involve 5 cadaver , perform clinical study 10 transrectal NOTES appendectomy patient already schedule undergo laparoscopic total proctocolectomy total abdominal colectomy . The tissue involve NOTES procedure remove part patient 's originally schedule operation , reduce risk morbidity result inadequate transrectal closure appendiceal stump leak . We measure operative time , complication rate , peritoneal contamination , assess integrity rectotomy closure . We hope show transrectal NOTES appendectomy clinically feasible human use TEM platform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transrectal NOTES Appendectomy - Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pre-clinical phase : We conduct first phase study cadaver troubleshoot procedure , determine optimal transrectal approach ( anterior versus posterior ) . We determine anterior transrectal approach feasible preferable posterior transrectal approach . Clinical phase : The second phase project feasibility study involve 10 human patient . We recruit patient already schedule undergo elective laparoscopic total proctocolectomy , total abdominal colectomy , completion proctectomy , sigmoidectomy surgical clinic . Operative procedure : Patients undergo standard preoperative mechanical bowel prep , receive standard perioperative antibiotic deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis reduce risk surgical site infection thromboembolic complication , respectively . The subject place lithotomy position , undergo general anesthesia per usual routine . A laparoscopic team NOTES team carry operation . The laparoscopic team obtain laparoscopic access use standard laparoscopic technique . The NOTES team perform rigid proctoscopy ass suitability rectum . The Karl-Storz ( Tuttlingen , Germany ) operate rectoscope use TEM . After position rectoscope , intraluminal tissue oximetry measurement take intended rectotomy site use FDA-approved endoscopic tissue oximetry probe ( T-StatÂ® , Spectros , Portola Valley , CA ) pass TEM device . In human patient , collect peritoneal fluid quantitative culture two time-points ( immediately peritoneal access , rectotomy closure ) , use sterile suction trap attach in-line laparoscopic suction irrigator determine level contamination procedure . The NOTES appendectomy complete use flexible endoscope laparoscopic assistance need . We remove specimen anus close rectal access site standard TEM closure . We perform standard intraoperative insufflation test submerge pelvis rectotomy site saline , insufflate rectum look bubble rectal closure site . At conclusion NOTES procedure , remove TEM device , laparoscopic team proceed laparoscopic proctocolectomy total abdominal colectomy originally plan . Once specimen remove , use bench-top test determine burst-pressure strength rectotomy closure . The specimen send pathology per standard routine , postoperative care proctocolectomy total abdominal colectomy patient proceed per usual routine . Outcome measurement : We measure operative time , intraoperative complication rate , tissue oxygen saturation closure site , rectotomy closure strength use intraoperative insufflation test ex-vivo burst-pressure test . In human case also obtain intraoperative quantitative peritoneal fluid culture quantify amount peritoneal contamination result NOTES procedure . Patients follow hospital ass complication potentially related NOTES procedure . They return evaluate surgeon two week follow procedure . At visit , additional post-operative complication potentially related NOTES procedure note patient 's medical record . Potential risk study include usual risk involve standard laparoscopic proctocolectomy total abdominal colectomy procedure include bleeding , infection , injury surround structure , port/trocar site pain , anastomotic leak , incontinence , sexual dysfunction . Additional potential risk include relate flexible endoscopy , include bowel perforation bleeding . In addition , possibility may new , unanticipated complication modify surgical technique . We estimate additional NOTES procedure add 90 minute general anesthesia time require patient 's laparoscopic total proctocolectomy . Patient risk mitigate procedure perform surgeon expertise advanced laparoscopic , colorectal NOTES surgery . This feasibility study evaluate potential feasibility modify NOTES technique 10 patient . Once standardized technique establish risk show low , prospective comparative evaluation plan compare modify approach NOTES approach .</detailed_description>
