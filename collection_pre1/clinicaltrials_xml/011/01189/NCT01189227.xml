	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way kill tumor cell stop grow . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . It yet know whether give combination chemotherapy surgery effective give combination chemotherapy surgery . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study give combination chemotherapy surgery see well work compare give combination chemotherapy surgery treat patient colorectal cancer liver metastasis could remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Before After Surgery Treating Patients With Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases That Could Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate difference recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) patient potentially resectable hepatic colorectal metastasis receive perioperative ( preoperative plus postoperative ) adjuvant chemotherapy v postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy follow liver resection colorectal metastasis . Secondary - To compare proportion patient study arm R0 R1 resect , alive , free recurrence 6 month . - To compare RFS study arm cohort patient event-free 6 month . - To compare overall survival study arm . - To evaluate difference R0 combine R0 + R1 resection rate patient receive neoadjuvant therapy undergo initial surgical resection . - To compare postoperative morbidity profile study arm . - To evaluate safety toxicity profile postoperative perioperative administration chemotherapy bevacizumab . Tertiary - To evaluate relationship baseline circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) RFS . - To evaluate relationship baseline CTC R0 resection . - To evaluate relationship pre-resection CTC preoperative therapy group RFS R0 resection . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify number liver metastasis ( 1-3 v 4+ ) , chemotherapy regimen* ( mFOLFOX6 v FOLFIRI ) , synchronous** primary colorectal cancer ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . NOTE : *Patients receive previous oxaliplatin receive mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1 . Patients receive previous oxaliplatin receive FOLFIRI chemotherapy comprise irinotecan hydrochloride IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1 . NOTE : **Synchronous define detection ( image ) suspicious liver metastasis within 90 day date histologic diagnosis primary colon rectal cancer . - Arm 1 ( postoperative ) : Patients undergo hepatic resection . Beginning 31-56 day surgery , patient receive mFOLFOX6 FOLFIRI chemotherapy IV day 1 3 hour . Patients receive additional dose fluorouracil 46 hour use portable pump . Treatment repeat every 2 week 12 course . - Arm 2 ( perioperative ) : Patients receive mFOLFOX6 FOLFIRI chemotherapy IV 3 hour day 1 . Patients receive additional dose fluorouracil 46 hour use portable pump . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course . Patients undergo hepatic resection . Beginning 31-56 day surgery , patient receive additional 6 course mFOLFOX6 FOLFIRI chemotherapy . Blood tumor tissue sample may collect periodically correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
