	<brief_title>SCH-900105 Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : SCH 900105 design block activity one tumor-causing proteins responsible development uncontrolled growth tumor cell formation new blood vessel . This may result shrink stop tumor growth . You need take SCH 900105 14 day surgery . If doctor decides risk delay surgery , able take part study . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level SCH 900105 base join study . Up 3 dose level ( Dose Levels 0 , 1 , 2 ) SCH 900105 test surgery . Three ( 3 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level ( Dose Level 0 ) . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose SCH 900105 find . No matter dose level assign surgery , participant receive Dose Level 1 SCH 900105 surgery . The amount study drug receive may change experience side effect . If time experience intolerable side effect , tell study doctor right away . Study Drug Administration : Cycle 1 30 day follow cycle 28 day . If assign Dose Levels 0 2 , receive SCH 900105 vein 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 . If assign Dose Level 1 , receive SCH 900105 vein 1 hour Days 1 15 Cycle 1 . As part standard care , surgery remove regrown tumor Day 16 Cycle 1 . You sign separate consent surgery , describe procedure risk detail . You receive SCH 900105 2 week surgery . After 2 week , receive SCH 900105 vein Days 1 15 cycle ( Cycles 2 beyond ) . Study Visits : At every visit , ask drug may take experienced side effect . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 17 Cycle 1 , MRI scan check status disease . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your complete medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 15 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 every cycle start Cycle 3 ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , ) , MRI scan check status disease . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Biomarker Tests : Extra blood drawn PK test biomarker test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . These test research . Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn follow time PK testing : - On Day 1 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 4 time . - On Day 15 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 3 time . - On Days 16 , 17 , 19 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time . - On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , blood drawn 1 time . - At 45 60 day last dose SCH 900105 , blood drawn 1 time . - If assign Dose Levels 0 2 , blood also draw 2 time Day 8 Cycle 1 . Blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn follow time biomarker testing : - On Days 1 15 Cycle 1 , blood drawn 1 time . - On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , blood drawn 1 time . - If assign Dose Levels 0 2 , blood also draw 1 time Day 8 Cycle 1 . Leftover tumor tissue ( remove surgery Day 16 Cycle 1 ) collect used PK test biomarker test . Length Study : You may continue receive SCH 900105 long benefitting . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . This investigational study . SCH 900105 FDA approve commercially available . At time , SCH 900105 use research . Up 21 patient enrol study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis supratentorial glioblastoma gliosarcoma pathology review initial tumor resection radiographic evidence recurrent tumor . 2 . Eligibility restrict patient clinical decision make perform surgery recurrence symptom relief cytoreduction . Due requirement SCH 900105 treatment give 15 day prior surgery , patient determine risk delay best clinical judgment neurosurgeon , treat neurooncologist study chair eligible entry study . 3 . ( 2. continue ) Patients poor clinical condition define Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) progressive symptom necessitate urgent surgery exclude study . 4 . Patients must enhance disease MRI scan sufficient provide tissue sample pathological diagnosis &amp; correlative study AND surgical plan include resection part tumor . Patients radiologically evident area tumor necrosis eligible entry study sufficient nonnecrotic tumor permit tissue correlative study . The study chair make determination help treat physician , neuroradiologist neurosurgeon whether particular patient fulfils radiological requirement study entry . 5 . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 12 week ( 84 Days ) completion radiation therapy study entry . 6 . Patients may treatment 3 prior relapse . Relapse define progression follow initial therapy ( i.e . radiation +/ chemo use initial therapy ) . The intent therefore patient 4 prior therapy ( initial treatment 3 relapse ) . For patient prior therapy lowgrade glioma , prior surgical diagnosis highgrade glioma consider first relapse . 7 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy time initiation study drug : 4 week investigational agent , two week vincristine , 6 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine administration , 3 week temozolomide , 4 week carboplatin , 1 week noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Prior antiangiogenic therapy allow . For patient undergone radiation therapy ( XRT ) , least 12 week elapse since completion XRT . 8 . Patients must equal great 18 year age . 9 . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must sign authorization release protect health information . 10 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( absolute granulocyte count &gt; /= 1,500 platelet count &gt; /= 100,000 ) , normal coagulation profile ( PT/PTT ) , adequate liver function ( SGPT , SGOT , alkaline phosphatase &lt; /= 2.5 time normal bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ) , adequate renal function ( BUN creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 time institutional normal ) institutional normal serum amylase within 14 day prior start therapy . 11 . Patients must Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) &gt; /= 60 . 12 . All patient ( men woman ) childbearing potential must agree use adequate birth control ( barrier method ) 1 month participation study . 13 . Women childbearing potential must negative Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( BHCG ) pregnancy test document within 14 day prior registration . 14 . This study design include woman minority , design measure difference intervention effect . Males female recruit preference gender . 15 . Archived paraffin embed tissue ( 15 unstained slide ) must available confirmation tumor diagnosis correlative study prior receive first dose SCH 900105 . 1 . Patients previously treat cMet inhibitor ineligible study . 2 . Patients must significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . 3 . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . 4 . Patients must active infection fever &gt; /= 38.5Â°C within 3 day prior first dose SCH 900105 . 5 . Patients must pregnant/breast feed 1 month participation study . 6 . Patients must disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . 7 . Patients fulldose anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin , low molecular weight heparin ) treatment deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolus ( PE ) , atrial fibrillation , myocardial infarction , thromboembolic event eligible . 8 . No exclusion study base race . Minorities actively recruit participate . The malignant glioma patient population treat MDACC past year follow : American Indian Alaskan Native 0 ; Asian Pacific Islander &lt; 2 % ; Black , Hispanic Origin 3 % ; Hispanic 6 % ; White , Hispanic Origin 88 % ; Other Unknown 2 % ; Total 100 % 9 . The safety profile SCH 900105 establish pediatric population , Patients age 18 exclude .</criteria>
