	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety determine optimal dose new drug , OMP-21M18 , give combination FOLFIRI , standard drug treatment advance colorectal cancer . Participants must one chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . OMP-21M18 humanized monoclonal antibody ( protein make laboratory ) develop target cancer stem cell . The way body handle OMP-21M18 also investigate . Up 32 participant , 21 year old , 6 centre Australia New Zealand , receive intravenous infusion OMP-21M18 follow FOLFIRI every two week , disease progression limit drug toxicity . After 8 week , participant undergo assessment determine disease status . If evidence disease progression participant continue receive infusion OMP-21M18 FOLFIRI every second week , disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study FOLFIRI Plus OMP-21M18 1st 2nd-line Treatment Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current cancer therapy often produce initial reduction tumour size may longterm benefit . One possible explanation presence cancer cell know cancer stem cell . Cancer stem cell represent small part tumour believe responsible much growth spread cancer . They may also resistant traditional type therapy , chemotherapy radiation therapy . The purpose study test safety determine optimal dose new experimental drug , OMP-21M18 , give combination FOLFIRI , chemotherapy regimen consist follow three medication : folinic acid ( leucovorin ) , 5fluorouracil irinotecan . The administration three medication standard treatment advance colorectal cancer . OMP-21M18 humanize monoclonal antibody ( protein make laboratory ) develop target cancer stem cell . The way body handle OMP21M18 also investigate . Up 32 participant , 21 year old , enrol 6 centre Australia New Zealand . Following informed consent screening , FOLFIRI administer every 14 day ( toxicity necessitate reduce delay dose ) . OMP-21M18 administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion every 14 day day FOLFIRI . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review data 6 participant dose level last participant group treat 56 day decide whether safe move next high dose level . After confirm optimum dose , 14 additional participant treat high dose level DSMB consider safe . Participants assess disease status every 8 week safety every visit 30 day end study drug treatment . Safety assess adverse event monitoring , physical examination , vital sign , blood test , cardiac monitoring , participant interview . Response rate , duration response , time progression , survival evaluate require CT MRI scan CEA ( tumour marker ) level baseline every 8 week . The development antibody treatment assess throughout study 12 week end study drug treatment . During study blood sample take assess whether OMP21M18 produce desire change gene protein related cancer ( biomarkers ) . The study include optional part investigate variation people 's genetic makeup affect response medication . This involve collection one blood sample participant receive first dose study treatment . DNA extract blood sample testing .</detailed_description>
