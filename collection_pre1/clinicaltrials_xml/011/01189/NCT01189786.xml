	<brief_summary>Participants ask take part study treatment disease require stem cell transplant . Stem cell `` mother '' cell source normal blood cell lead recovery blood count bone marrow transplantation . Unfortunately , perfectly match stem cell donor ( like sister brother ) participant disease permit enough time identify another donor ( like someone registry list relative ) another suitable donor identify . However , close relative patient identify whose stem cell perfect match , use . Alternatively , patient may already receive stem cell transplant evidence mixed chimerism , mean patient 's bone marrow cell present , rather donor 's cell . This may lead increase risk disease come back . Or , patient may donor cell bone marrow work well , may lead frequent blood platelet ( cell help clot blood ) transfusion infection . Regardless reason , may necessary isolate stem cell haploidentical ( half-match ) donor order provide bone marrow function . Because stem cell donor half-matched participant , risk graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) high . GvHD complication transplant cause donor T cell ( graft ) attack transplant recipient , complication cause death transplant . Thus , important donor 's blood cell treat minimize cell likely attack host 's tissue . This do use special device capture CD34+ stem cell donor 's stem cell product prior give cell host . This method minimize donor T cell , responsible cause GvHD . Purpose : In effort low occurrence severity graft-versus-host disease patient low rate transplant failure , investigator would like specially treat donor 's blood cell minimize cell likely attack patient 's tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation project last approximately one year follow-up exam . Before treatment begin , stem cell collect donor ( close relative ) select best match participant . White blood cell collect donor . The cell mixed special protein , call CD34 antibody , bind stem cell , separate white blood cell special machine- call CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System laboratory . This investigational device approve FDA . Although device approve use country , use year approve country . The stem cell collect frozen give participant . On day 28 , 100 365 transplant , participant tests/evaluations since time transplant ; however , participant also bone marrow aspirate . This sample bone marrow take evaluate participant 's disease Graft v . Host Disease ( GvHD ) status . For patient develop GvHD , may additional bone marrow aspirate year transplant . In addition , purpose study , health-related information collect year time stem cell infusion . This used determine survival , relapse , infection GvHD may occur follow transplant .</detailed_description>
