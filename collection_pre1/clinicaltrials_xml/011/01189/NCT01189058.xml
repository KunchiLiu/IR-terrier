	<brief_summary>Newborn stroke lead cause common type cerebral palsy ( CP ) affect thousand Canadian child family . Treatments CP generally ineffective , traditionally focused weak body rather injured brain . Understanding newborn brain respond injury like stroke ( plasticity ) carry great potential good treatment . We propose study ability two intervention modulate brain plasticity toward good function child stroke-induced CP . One rehabilitation method call constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) , type non-invasive brain stimulation call transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . TMS safe comfortable child recently show could improve motor function child stroke . We perform special study test treatment simultaneously . Children 7-18 year stroke-induced CP recruit study across Alberta . Each child randomly receive either TMS , CIMT , , neither day two week attend new HemiKids Power Camp motor learning . Improvements measure trained therapist 1 year . TMS also measure brain plasticity , initially follow treatment . Our lead investigator expert newborn stroke TMS assemble experienced team accomplish collaborator ensure completion important work . This large study child CP examine manner . This first clinical trial non-invasive brain stimulation ( TMS ) CP , large trial CIMT ( first exclusive newborn stroke ) , first study allow direct comparison two different therapy . In establish first dedicate pediatric TMS laboratory Canada , first measure plasticity change newborn stroke , advance new treatment previously untreatable disable disease . Patient recruitment currently underway Alberta Children 's Hospital . Application currently underway expand recruitment Northern Alberta Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Stollery Children 's Hospital , enable patient Northern Alberta great opportunity participate subject study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Perinatal stroke lead cause common term-born cerebral palsy : hemiplegic CP ( HCP ) . With morbidity span aspect child 's life lasting decade , global impact large . Mechanisms poorly understood prevention strategy remain elusive . Treatments limit , leading loss hope child family merit exploration new intervention . Constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) may benefit proper clinical trial require . The investigator clinical-radiographic classification establish perinatal stroke syndrome correlate neurological outcome . Most common : ( 1 ) arterial ischemic stroke middle cerebral artery ( AIS-MCA ) feature cortical subcortical damage acquire birth ( 2 ) periventricular venous infarction ( PVI ) , novel subcortical injury acquire utero . These syndrome differ essential variable plastic organization perinatal injury : location timing . In addition , recent animal human study suggest may share similar maladaptive plasticity whereby motor control weak side `` installed '' non-lesioned hemisphere development . Despite ideal plasticity model focal injury young brain provide , study limit suffer small number older patient heterogeneous lesion . The value study plastic organization realize upon translation meaningful patient benefit . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) offer non-invasive measurement neurophysiological brain property underlie neuroplasticity . Repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) may modulate system therapeutic effect . investigator recently demonstrate ability rTMS improve motor function child chronic stroke . Advances perinatal brain injury neurodevelopment , first time , afford novel window opportunity intervention direct plastic organization toward good outcome . Via Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project ( APSP ) , investigator propose clinical trial two intervention improve function HCP measure fundamental neurophysiological property play . Aim 1 . Determine rTMS CIMT improve motor function HCP . Hypothesis : Two week daily rTMS improves motor function 30 day . Aim 2 . Define neurophysiology motor organization stroke‚Äêinduced HCP baseline follow rTMS CIMT . Hypothesis : rTMS CIMT reduce excitability non-lesioned motor cortex . Population-based study Alberta Perinatal Stroke Project ( APSP ) establish large perinatal stroke cohort date . The investigator complete factorial 2 x 2 randomized clinical trial determine ability daily rTMS CIMT improve motor function child HCP . Families attend child-centered , custom-designed intensive motor learn rehabilitation program ( KidsCan Power Camp ) 2 week . Outcomes include validated measure motor function CP quality life . The investigator simultaneously measure neurophysiology plastic organization use TMS include cortical excitability , interhemispheric inhibition , short interval intracortical inhibition . Baseline measure define organization pattern post-interventional measurement evaluate neurophysiological effect rTMS CIMT . Four group 16 child ( n=64 ) study 24 month interim safety analysis 10 32 patient . Successful completion assure principle investigator experience perinatal stroke TMS collaborative support world leader pediatric adult stroke , TMS , basic neuroscience , physiatry/rehabilitation . Understanding perinatal stroke plasticity discover method modulate toward good outcome carry large impact , great child CP family .</detailed_description>
