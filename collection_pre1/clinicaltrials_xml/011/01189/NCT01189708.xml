	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate effect implantation UltraproÂ® Mesh prevention incisional hernia elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair . According literature patient increase risk incisional hernia . By implantation artificial mesh abdominal wall first abdominal aortic aneurysm repair , risk reduce dramatically . In small feasibility study incisional hernia rate low 0 % achieve . Patients schedule elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair randomize two group , one receiving onlay mesh , conventional wound closure suture .</brief_summary>
