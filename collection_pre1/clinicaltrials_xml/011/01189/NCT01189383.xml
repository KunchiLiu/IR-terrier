	<detailed_description>IL15 T cell growth factor pre-clinical data overwhelmingly suggests could important role cancer immunotherapy . A desirable property dendritic cell vaccine direct cancer ability efficiently prime na√Øve , tumor associate antigen specific T cell potent CTLs . Results study healthy volunteer show IL15 DCs particularly efficient prim functional melanoma specific CD8+ T cell . The use IL15 manufacture DC vaccine could result improved immunotherapy product .</detailed_description>
