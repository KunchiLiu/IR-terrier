	<brief_title>Evaluate Safety Tolerability Dose Escalation Sorafenib Advanced Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2006 , estimate 38,890 people United States diagnose kidney cancer great 12,000 die disease . Kidney cancer spread part body one treatment-resistant disease . Standard care treatment usually involve chemotherapy . Results chemotherapy disappointing . Therefore , need develop additional safe effective therapy treat advanced kidney cancer . Sorafenib ( Nexavar® ) approve FDA treatment advance kidney cancer . Sorafenib work interfere type protein body determine kidney cell work grow . Sorafenib standard dose 400mg ( two pill ) twice/day , give seven days/week , may slow progression disease average three month expect curative . Preliminary study suggest high dos sorafenib may increase chance tumor shrink .</detailed_description>
