	<detailed_description>Liu et al . ( 2003 ) report DM protect dopamine ( DA ) neuron inflammation-mediated degeneration . Zhang et al . 's ( 2004 ) novel find 1-10 μM DM protect DA neuron LPS ( 10 ng/mL ) -induced reduction DA uptake functionally rat primary mixed mesencephalic neuron-glia culture . Morphologically , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -treated culture , addition reduction abundance DA neuron , dendrites remain DA neuron significantly less elaborate control . In culture pretreated DM ( 10 μM ) LPS stimulation , DA neuron significantly numerous dendrite less affected . Significant neuroprotective observe culture DM add 60 minute addition LPS . Thus , DM significantly protect DA neuron pretreatment also post-treatment ( Zhang et al . 2004 ) . The mechanism neuronprotective effect DM associate inhibition microglia activation NMDA receptor antagonist property . Zhang et al . ( 2005 ) examine several N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , include MK801 , AP5 , memantine . Results study indicate among compound test correlation affinity NMDA receptor antagonist activity potency neuroprotective DA neuron . On contrary , good correlation find anti-inflammatory potency neuron protection . These result suggest DA neuroprotection provide DM inflammation-related neurodegenerative model mediate NMDA receptor . This conclusion conflict previous report , indicate NMDA receptor blockade associate neuroprotective effect DM acute glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model . The evidence benefit auto-immune system dextromethorphan would support dextromethorphan add-on therapy atypical antipsychotic might effective atypical antipsychotic alone improvement positive negative symptom schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
