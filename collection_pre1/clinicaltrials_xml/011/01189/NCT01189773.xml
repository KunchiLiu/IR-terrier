	<detailed_description>Children 's pain Emergency Departments ( ED ) poorly manage even though pain one main symptom child consult ED ( Alexander et al. , 2003 ; O'Donnell et al. , 2002 ) . Literature repeatedly demonstrate provision analgesia suboptimal pediatric population general . Friedland &amp; Kulick ( 1994 ) review medical record 99 child acute fracture assume painful find 53 % receive analgesia . Southall et al . ( 1993 ) show 181 invasive procedure perform child receive intensive care , 50 ( 28 % ) receive additional analgesia sedation 36 procedure child grimace cried ( In Maurice et al. , 2002 ) . Pain management practice nurse doctor emergency department ( ED ) poor . Selbst &amp; Clark ( 1990 ) note child ( &lt; 19 year ) present painful condition ED much less likely receive pain medication adult ( p = .001 ) . Moreover , child also less likely adult receive analgesic discharge ( p &lt; .001 ) . The author conclude mention pediatrician emergency physician reluctant use analgesic child pain need additional education management acute pain . Recently , Brown et al . ( 2003 ) obtain similar result comparative chart review adult child present ED diagnostic fracture . According result , child least likely receive analgesic especially opioids . Compared adult , low proportion ( 54 % ) child ( &lt; 15 year ) receive opioid ( p &lt; .001 ) . Moreover , result PAMPER study ( Le May et al. , 2005 ; Le May et al. , 2007 ) reveal 150 child present ED either fracture , severe sprain , burn , acute abdomen deep laceration , nurse physician document pain 58 % ( 87/150 ) child , even though diagnosis know generate moderate severe pain ( &gt; 4/10 ) . Treatment child present ED simple fracture also poorly manage . Results study show 4 child 28 ( 14 % ) present ED simple fracture receive analgesic . Efficacy several medication verify relieve pain limb injury child consult ED . Results study show ibuprofen effective relieve pain . But , study small sample size affect power generalize result ( Koller et al. , 2007 ; Tanabe et al . 2002 ) . Only RCT perform Clark et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrate ibuprofen ( 10 mg/kg ) effective , 60-minute post-administration , acetaminophen 15 mg/kg ) codeine ( 1 mg/kg ) alone , relieve child 's pain follow musculoskeletal trauma . This trial total sample 300 patient 18-year 100 patient per group . Nevertheless , 52 % group child receive ibuprofen consider pain well manage . On hand , important specify aware codeine pro-drug necessitates co-enzyme 2D6 CYP 450 release morphine analgesic component . Close 12 % Caucasian population co-enzyme , codeine effective relieve pain ( Williams et al. , 2002 ) . Nevertheless , since part emergency physician ' practice ED prescribe opioid limb trauma , need evidence-based data prove combination medication would help decrease pain intensity . Further , study first do ED use combination analgesic imply opioid , need start weaker safer opioid codeine . Kennedy ( 2004 ) Mehlisc ( 2002 ) propose use combination analgesic ( opioid non-steroidal inflammatory drug-NSAID ) good relieve child 's pain generate musculoskeletal trauma . Their rationale base potential NSAID block pain impulse peripherically decrease edema potential opioid block pain level nervous central system . Finally , study verify efficacy combination analgesic relieve pain generate limb trauma . An exhausted review literature retrieve study compare efficacy combination codeine ibuprofen ibuprofen alone relieve musculoskeletal pain child consult ED . Design : Randomized control trial ( double blind ) experimental group receive codeine + ibuprofen control group receive ibuprofen + placebo . Single site study . Instruments : Pain measure Verbal Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . The VAS slide scale divide 0 mm ( absence pain ) 100 mm ( bad pain experience ) . The VAS use several clinical trial child consider valid child 6 year ( Clark et al. , 2007 ; Giannoni et al. , 2002 ; Warnock &amp; Lander , 1998 ; Elhakim et al. , 2003 ; Tyler et al. , 1993 ) . A checklist use evaluate incidence common side effect might experience follow administration opioid . Sample : Randomized sample 200 child present ED injured limb . Sample size calculation : The sample size estimate accord minimal difference require VAS significant clinical value . A difference 15 mm standard deviation 25 mm consider clinically significant ( Clark et al. , 2007 ) . Since two group four different measure time , choose alpha 0,01 ( bilateral ) . A sample 67 child experimental control group consider sufficient detect difference 15 mm group , power 80 % . Our final sample size 100 child per group consider drop rate 40 % . Since Ste-Justine 's ED handle close 5000 case limb trauma per year , reasonable estimate able recruit 200 patient period 12 month day even shift week day . Inclusion criterion : 1 ) 6 18 y.o. , 2 ) pain intensity &gt; 30 mm , 3 ) understand , read and/or speak French English , 4 ) injury within last 24 hr , 5 ) trauma limb without significant angulation ( &lt; 30 degree ) . Exclusion criterion : 1 ) allergy opioids , ibuprofen food coloring , 2 ) child suffer asthma , 3 ) child present critical state , 4 ) social physical abuse case , 5 ) child cognitive deficit ( autism ) , 6 ) child multiple trauma , 7 ) child suffer chronic pain , 8 ) Children receive analgesic within past six hour . Setting : The ED Ste . Justine 's University Health Centre Montreal . Interventions double blind procedure : The randomized sequence generate computer program manage pharmacist independent study . Children allocate experimental group receive syrup codeine chewable tablet ibuprofen . The child control group receive syrup contain placebo chewable tablet ibuprofen . Pain measured triage ( medication administration ) -T1 , 60 minute post-administration-T2 , 90 minutes-T3 , 120 minutes-T4 . Side effect vital sign include saturation measure research nurse measuring time study . For security purpose , standardize protocol elaborate ever child present severe sedation , respiratory depression , nausea/vomiting follow administration medication . Data collection representativeness sample : Research nurse associate project collect data 12h00 20h00 week day possibility collect data one week end per month period time . Children present 10h00 ED consider study . Each recruit participant register log sheet ( screen log ) require information register patient receive code confidential purpose . Also , patient refuse participate patient present outside hour allocate data collection register different log ( Log RMO- Refusal , Missed , Other ) register chart number , name patient , sex , age , date visit , reason consultation reason patient refuse miss . Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic present sociodemographic variable group . A covariant model repeat measure use verify variation pain intensity among group time study . The model include Time variable ( T-1 T-4 ) , Group variable ( experimental control ) , initial pain intensity triage ( T-1 ) , presence parent , use non-pharmacological method . Comparisons do alpha 0,01 . Incidence side effect among group compare use chi-squared test . Finally , intention treat analysis perform participant randomize , receive medication , leave study afterwards . The following outcome use measure achievement objective : Main outcome : Pain intensity 60 min ( T-2 ) 90 min . ( T-3 ) follow administration medication compare pain intensity triage ( T-1 ) . Secondary outcome : Incidence side effect 60 , 90 120 min . ( T-4 ) follow medication administration .</detailed_description>
