	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Extended Release ( ER ) Tramadol Hydrochloride ( HCl ) /Acetaminophen Participants With Chronic Low-Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind ( medical research study neither researcher participant know treatment participant receive ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group ( medical research study compare response 2 group participant receive different intervention [ treatment ] ) up-titration study participant chronic low back pain . The study consist 6 visit ( Day -7 Day -1 [ Visit 1 ] , Day 1 [ Visit 2 ] , Day 3 [ telephone visit ] , Day 8 [ Visit 3 ] , Day 15 [ Visit 4 ] Day 29 [ Visit 5 ] ) 2 phase : screen phase treatment phase . Screening phase 7 day , participant receive stable dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) COX-2 selective inhibitor ( NSAID specifically inhibit enzyme know cyclooxygenase-2 ) pain therapy . On basis average pain intensity last 48 hour measure baseline ( end screening period ) , participant enter treatment phase . Treatment phase 28 day include 7-days dose titration period . In treatment phase participant randomly assign 1 2 possible treatment : tramadol HCl 75 milligram ( mg ) /acetaminophen 650 mg ER tablet treatment equivalent placebo ( inactive substance ) treatment study completion , Day 29 . Participants receive 1 tablet tramadol HCl/acetaminophen ER equivalent placebo , daily 3 day . After first 3 day , participant receive telephone inquiry monitoring occurrence adverse event give additional administration instruction next 4 day ( 1 tablet twice daily 4 day ) . From Day 7 , participant receive 1 2 tablet twice day depend degree pain relief require . Participants visit center Day 8 ( Visit 3 ) , Day 15 ( Visit 4 ) , Day 29 ( Visit 5 ) start study drug . The efficacy assess measure extent reduction pain intensity Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
