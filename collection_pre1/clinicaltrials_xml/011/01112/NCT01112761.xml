	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine whether athlete concussion change cortical excitability . Single pair transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use reliable neurophysiological marker motor cortex reorganization athlete concussion . This study also aim determine whether modulation cortical activity powerful technique noninvasive brain stimulation ( tDCS ) result different cortical response compare sham tDCS .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Studentathletes risk traumatic brain injury ( collegiate football , ice hockey ) Age 18 30 yr. Concussion define American Academy Neurology : traumainduced alteration mental status may may involve loss consciousness ( confusion amnesia hallmark concussion ) Concussion occur &gt; 6 month All head injury classify minor Glasgow Coma Scale 13 15 time trauma Participants clear full sport participation base upon neurological neuropsychological ( NS ) assessment Classified symptomatic base Postconcussion Symptom List Previous significant neurological history Use tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline , nortriptyline imipramine within past six month . Use anticonvulsant carbamazepine , phenytoin , valproic acid gabapentin within past six month History seizure , depression PTSD Presence postconcussion symptom complaint loss concentration , dizziness , fatigue , headache , irritability , visual disturbance , light sensitivity . Contraindications single pulse TMS ( TMS use measure cortical excitability ) metal head implant history seizure unexplained loss consciousness metal head frequent severe headache neck pain implanted brain medical device . Contraindications tDCS : metal head implant brain medical device For control group ( subject concussion ) select subject accord previously state list exclusion well follow criterion : Subjects athlete ( similar concuss group ) age range also similar level education ; however subject prior history concussion neurological insult self report . They also contraindications TMS tDCS .</criteria>
