	<brief_summary>There three arm study ( A , B C ) The purpose research study Arm A see much PF-00299804 get brain tumor . For many brain tumor , one reason chemotherapy drug might effective drug may able get brain tumor kill cancer cell . We determine much PF-00299804 get brain tumor obtain sample tumor surgery participant already schedule . The purpose research study Arm B C , determine well PF-00299804 work kill cancer cell . PF-00299804 work bind specific protein find surface cancer cell promote growth signal . Blocking signal reaching target cancer cell may slow stop cancer grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PF-00299804 Adult Patients With Relapsed/Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARM A : - Each treatment cycle last four week ( 28 day ) . There break take PF-00299804 treatment cycle . Participants take PF-00299804 day total 7 9 day surgery . They stop take PF-00299804 recover surgery . - Once recover surgery , continue take PF-00299804 day disease worsens , experience side effect decide stop study treatment . - The following test procedure perform time interval specify : Research blood test ( Day 1 study drug administration , day surgery , day 1 cycle surgery , day 14 first cycle surgery ) ; tissue sample ( day surgery ) ; physical neuro exam ( day 1 cycle surgery ) ; skin exam ( day 1 cycle surgery day 14 first cycle surgery ) . - An assessment tumor CT MRI scan make within 24 hour surgery . Another assessment CT MRI scan make end cycle 2 end every even numbered cycle thereafter . ARM B &amp; C : - Each treatment cycle last four week ( 28 day ) . There break take PF-00299804 treatment cycle . Participants take PF-00299804 orally day disease worsens , experience side effect , decide stop study treatment . - Participants come clinic Day 1 Day 14 Cycle 1 , Day 1 subsequent cycle follow test procedure : research blood test , physical neuro exam , skin exam , urine test Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaire . - An assessment participant tumor CT scan MRI scan do end Cycle 2 , 4 every cycle thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year age old Histologically confirm diagnosis recurrent primary WHO grade IV malignant glioma ( glioblastoma ) . Patients recurrent disease whose diagnostic pathology confirm glioblastoma need rebiopsy . Patients prior lowgrade glioma anaplastic glioma eligible histologic assessment demonstrate transformation GBM . Evidence EGFR gene amplification fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) archival tumor material . Patients must least 15 unstained slide 1 tissue block ( frozen paraffin embed ) available prior biopsy surgery . For Arm A : patient must first recurrence GBM , must previous antiVEGF therapy , must candidate surgical partial grosstotal resection . For Arm B : patient must first recurrence GBM must prior antiVEGF therapy . For Arm C : patient may unlimited number prior therapy GBM , however must first recurrence therapeutic regimen contain bevacizumab Progressive disease contrastenhanced brain CT MRI define McDonald Criteria , document recurrent glioblastoma diagnostic biopsy . Prior enrollment , must interval least 2 week prior surgical resection ( 1 week intracranial biopsy ) adequate wound heal . Interval least 12 week prior radiotherapy unless either : ) histopathologic confirmation recurrent tumor , b ) new enhancement MRI outside XRT treatment field . Patients must sufficient time recover prior therapy . Karnofsky Performance Score 70 % great Adequate hematologic liver function outline protocol Creatinine within normal institutional limit Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation least 3 month thereafter . Presence extracranial metastatic disease Participants may receive investigational agent Prior investigational therapy agent know propose active action component EGFR tyrosine kinase , IGF1R , mTor , orcMET pathway Patients previously treat antiVEGF agent exclude Arm A Arm B . Patients must receive prior Gliadel wafer For participant Arm A , diagnostic pathology biopsy specimen consistent recurrent glioblastoma , participant must take study replace another participant meet inclusion criterion eligible surgical resection .
