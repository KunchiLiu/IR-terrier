	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause adult disability third lead cause death Canada . Most stroke survivor live residual impairment diminish independence quality life . This may include vascular cognitive impairment ( loss ability plan , think reason ) lead dementia loss mental functional independence . The current treatment reduce stroke induce brain tissue injury limit thrombolytic ( clot buster ) , therapy useful give first hour follow stroke . One major new approach aim reduce cell death stroke target ongoing tissue loss initiate stroke . The tissue maintain interfere later neurochemical process activate stroke , potentially activate natural substance brain help survival growth nerve cell ( `` neurotrophic '' factor ) . The recent recognition lithium neurotrophic agent generate first study lithium treatment manage brain disease . Clinically , lithium show increase brain gray matter volume bipolar patient . This effect potentially important stroke gray matter loss implicate development cognitive impairment stroke , result series brain process activate lack oxygen due stroke . Our primary objective examine effect lithium total brain gray matter volume post-stroke population , measure volumetric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) hope lithium may increase gray matter volume post-stroke patient lead great cognitive functional rehabilitation . This study provide valuable information tolerability lithium , effect clinical outcome relevant stroke , provide information need design large-scale clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Neurotrophic Effects Lithium Carbonate Following Stroke : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recognition lithium neurotrophic agent provide rationale evaluation agent animal model cerebral ischemia . Numerous animal vitro study show lithium-mediated neurotrophic effect involve mechanism highly relevant post-stroke population : induction brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) inhibition abnormal activity glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK-3 ) . Lithium consistently show increase serum concentration neurotrophic factor , BDNF . BDNF involve neuronal proliferation , survival , differentiation facilitates cortical reorganization functional recovery focal ischemia ( rat ) . GSK-3 neurotrophic intermediary . In animal vitro model , lithium treatment effectively reduce severity ischemic damage protects ischemic damage central nervous system ( CNS ) neuron result glutamate-induced cell death . Importantly , benefit present lithium give ischemic event rather prophylactically . The goal pharmacotherapy post-stroke enhance restoration neurological function limit structural degradation . Gray matter atrophy relevant post-stroke relevant outcome implicate development vascular cognitive impairment stroke result series neurochemical process activate ischemia . While first clinical study examine neurotrophic effect lithium effect total gray matter volume bipolar subject emerge , yet explore post-stroke population . Our primary objective determine tolerability lithium follow stroke examine effect clinical outcome include total brain gray matter volume measure volumetric magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . In feasibility study , lithium carbonate ( target 0.4 0.8 mmol/L ) give open-label 60 day , consent patient unilateral ischemic cortical lesion . Total gray matter volume use magnetic resonance imaging also measure baseline termination , relate change clinical outcome ( standardized scale measure cognitive , activity daily live , motor recovery ) perform time MRIs . We expect find post-stroke patient receive lithium increase gray matter volume , increase gray matter volume predict improvement clinical outcome 60 day . In addition , since lithium show increase serum concentration neurotrophic factor , BDNF , explore relationship plasma BDNF concentration neurological clinical outcome . This study provide key information clinical importance determine whether clinical trial lithium desirable feasible . Results project potential focus development lithium new treatment strategy would improve outcomes individual societal level .</detailed_description>
