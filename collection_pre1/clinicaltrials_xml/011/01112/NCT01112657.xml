	<brief_title>An Observational Study Progression Clinically Isolated Syndrome Multiple Sclerosis Over 2-year Period</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis chronic , inflammatory disease central nervous system ( CNS ) characterise area demyelination , plaque , CNS . In 85 % subject later develop MS , clinical onset acute subacute episode neurological disturbance due single white-matter lesion ( e.g . optic neuritis , isolated brainstem partial spinal-cord syndrome ) . This presentation know Clinically Isolated Syndrome ( CIS ) . Because CIS typically earliest clinical expression MS , research subject CIS may provide new insight early pathological change pathogenetic mechanism might affect course disorder . In group subject optic-spinal MS ( OSMS ) , main lesion typically confine optic nerve spinal cord . In Asians , OSMS similar feature relapse remit form neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) see Westerners . It still matter debate whether NMO represent disease entity whether subform MS . Early differentiation NMO MS highly desirable , treatment option prognoses differ widely . Recently , new serum autoantibody ( NMO-IgG ) detect NMO subject . The binding sit autoantibody report colocalize aquaporin 4 ( AQP4 ) water channel . Optic-spinal MS sometime suggest NMO base frequent detection anti-AQP4 IgG antibody . In Taiwan , study show 56 % MS subject optic-spinal type . OBJECTIVES The study design firstly , observe MS progression subject since first episode neurological event secondly , determine status anti-AQP4 IgG antibody MS subject . Primary objective : - To describe progression subject experience CIS MS 2-year period Secondary objective : - To assess relationship CIS MS include optic-spinal MS ( OSMS ) - To determine status anti-AQP4 IgG antibody subject convert MS Each subject shall follow 2 year enrolment . At baseline , routine examination shall perform confirm subject 's neurological episode . After baseline visit , subject shall instructed return examination he/she experience relapse . During follow-up examination , treat physician shall determine whether subject fulfil diagnostic criterion MS . If subject diagnose MS , he/she shall consider reach end his/her study participation . Further management MS condition discretion treat physician . During 2-year follow-up period , telephone call subject shall make quarterly ass subject 's neurological and/or visual status remind subject he/she need return evaluation event relapse . All data collect use standardised case report form ( CRF ) .</detailed_description>
