	<brief_title>Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Laparoscopic Resection Early Colorectal Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy play increasingly important role diagnosis treatment colorectal pathology . The recent progress endoscopic technology interest colorectal cancer screen enable diagnosis large number early colorectal neoplasm , include benign polyp early cancer . Colonoscopic polypectomy remain cornerstone therapy majority colorectal polyp help prevent colorectal cancer . However , colorectal neoplasms large remove `` en bloc '' endoscopically , operative procedure require reduce risk incomplete removal local recurrence . Laparoscopic resection represent minimally invasive alternative treat colorectal neoplasm amenable en bloc endoscopic resection . However , laparoscopic surgery do general anesthesia , associate operative morbidity , expensive . Endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) revolutionary endoscopic procedure enable en bloc resection large gastrointestinal tumor , irrespective size lesion . ESD , pioneer Japan treatment early gastric neoplasm , successfully apply colon rectum . ESD show recent study safe effective resection technique large early colorectal neoplasm . However , report find literature compare ESD laparoscopic resection early colorectal neoplasm amenable en bloc endoscopic resection conventional technique . Furthermore , remain unclear whether ESD less invasive laparoscopic surgery term systemic inflammatory cytokine response , may implications cancer recurrence . We propose conduct prospective randomize trial compare short-term clinical outcome systemic inflammatory/cytokine response ESD versus laparoscopic resection early colorectal neoplasm amenable en bloc endoscopic resection conventional technique . The overall cost two therapeutic approach also compare . Findings propose project may provide evidence-based clarification efficacy safety ESD treat early colorectal neoplasm . We hypothesize ESD associate low morbidity , early recovery , short hospital stay , low cost compare laparoscopic resection . A fast recovery earlier discharge ESD may reduce financial burden hospital health care system . The result propose project may significant impact future treatment strategy early colorectal neoplasm , may provide new insight systemic inflammatory response ESD .</detailed_description>
