	<detailed_description>The aim Phase II Clinical Trial demonstrate efficacy social cognitive theory ( SCT ) base intervention initiating , importantly , maintain resistance training old adult pre-diabetes ( i.e. , impair glucose tolerance impair fast glucose ) improve glucose homeostasis . The overall aim consistent NIDDK 's Behavioral/Prevention Research Program 's focus individual , family , community-based strategy prevention diabetes complication . Resistance train particularly applicable old , pre-diabetic adult give loss lean body mass worsen glucose tolerance age . The propose research program evaluate 15-month SCT base intervention maintenance resistance training old adult . Men woman 50-69 ( N=180 ) pre-diabetes , define exhibit either impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ; 2-h glucose 140-199 mg/dl ) impair fast glucose ( IFG ; 100-125 mg/dl ) , first follow standard , supervise 3-month initiation period resistance training . All people complete Initial Phase randomly assign 1 2 maintenance condition : 1. long-term SCT base , ASPIRE intervention , emphasize self-regulation SCT strategy optimize training , fade contact ; 2. Standard intervention minimal contact . The primary outcome measure indices pre-diabetes ( glucose tolerance fast glucose concentration ) strength . Secondary measure include adherence ; ÃŸ-cell responsivity , insulin sensitivity , disposition index , determine oral glucose C-peptide minimal model ; fat free mass , indicator health metabolic fitness , SCT measure . Assessments occur baseline , end Initiation Phase ( 3 month ) , end different intervention ( 9 month ) 6 month contact end ( 15 month baseline ) . It hypothesize SCT base resistance training fade contact produce good outcomes Standard-based resistance training 9 month 15 month assessment . It also hypothesize improvement glucose homeostasis strength resistance training mediate adherence , self-efficacy , use self-regulation strategy . Resistance train become important component treatment prevention diseases disability , especially Type 2 diabetes . Critical public health focus NIDDK theory-based intervention enable , effective long-term resistance training minimal supervision initiation phase improvement adherence outcomes facilitate theoretical construct .</detailed_description>
