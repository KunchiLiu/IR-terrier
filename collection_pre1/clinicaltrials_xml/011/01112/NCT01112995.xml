	<brief_title>A Pilot Trial Determine Efficacy Lactobacillus Rhamnosus Reducing Colonization Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) ( PROSE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthcare-associated infection important threat patient safety . Currently , 5 10 percent patient admit acute care hospital acquire one infection ; healthcare-associated infection affect approximately 2 million patient year United States , result 90,000 death , associate add cost $ 4.5 $ 5.7 billion per year . Seventy percent healthcare-associated infection cause antimicrobial resistant bacteria , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , result increase antimicrobial usage , morbidity mortality , make prevention multiresistant bacteria essential . Eradication colonization show greatly reduce infection ; however , reliable mean provide sustained eradication colonization . No effective mean eradicate MRSA colonization exist . Probiotics contain strain lactobacilli represent novel approach prevention control antimicrobial resistance study extensively variety infection . Even though various study show probiotic effective prevention vaginal infection , urinary tract infection , etc study examine potential probiotic eradicate colonization resistant pathogen , MRSA .</detailed_description>
