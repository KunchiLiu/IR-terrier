	<brief_title>Weight-bearing Measuring Device Determine Normative Percentage Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing Values Weight-bearing Gait Characteristics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background information Orthopedic surgeon rehabilitation physician frequently request limited weight-bearing prolong period follow certain bony soft tissue pathology well certain low - limb surgical procedure . Walking , stair climbing , jogging , elliptical training run treadmill common activity injure athlete seek return soon possible follow injury surgery . In order physician able advise regard weight-bearing , Percentage Body-Weight/Weight-Bearing ( PBW/WB ) value increase walk , jog speed , elliptical training must know . These parameter well gait distribution change elude rehabilitation community , mainly due technical inability measure paradigm . Accurate percentage body weight/weight-bearing ( PBW/WB ) value analysis walk investigated laboratory setting , use balance plate system force plate platform . The aim study evaluate normal gait characteristic PBW/WB value use relatively new hand-held , portable , weight-bearing measuring device ( Smartstep™ ) . During regular training participant use flexible , light weight , force-sensing insole minute receive parameter 1. subject . In order accurately control speed change , test measurement conduct treadmill ( Technogym™ `` run excite 700 '' ) . The tested speed 4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18 20 km/hr consecutively . Each subject run 15 second time period speed . 2 . 25 subject . The test measurement conduct Elliptical trainer ( Precor USA 576i EFX ) . The protocol include 3 test . In first test , resistance incline pair together increase order set device level 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 . In second test , resistance hold constant level 1 , incline increase level 1 20 increment five . In third test , incline remain constant level 1 , resistance increase level 1 20 increment five . Each subject test 20 second time period change resistance incline . The subject instruct keep steady pace within range steps/min = 70-95 . 3 . 40 subject . The test subject instruct jog normal speed solid ground surface distance 16 meter . 4 . 40 subject . The test measurement conduct flight 10 stair , 17cm high . The subject instruct ascend descend stair normal pace . 5 . 40 subject . The tested speed hold 8.5 km/hr treadmill ( Technogym™ `` run excite 700 '' ) . Each subject run 15 second time period . 6 . 40 subject . The test subject instruct walk normal speed solid ground surface distance 16 meter . The result analyze table normal value establish include average PBW/WB value entire , hind fore-foot well gait distribution change .</detailed_description>
