	<brief_title>A Study SB939 Patients With Translocation-Associated Recurrent/Metastatic Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : 1 . - To determine efficacy SB939 translocation associate sarcoma patient . 2 . - To determine response duration , stable disease rate progression free survival . 3 . - To evaluate toxicity SB939 . 4 . - To investigate potential molecular factor predictive response . 60mg SB939 give every day 3 time week 3 week follow week . Patients may receive maximum 12 cycle response treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease may continue therapy maximum 6 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically diagnose sarcoma associate chromosomal translocation produce fusion transcription factor oncogene . Patients must measurable disease . A tissue block primary metastatic tumor must available confirmation diagnosis , translocation subtype correlative study . Up 1 prior chemotherapy regimen metastatic setting permit provide 28 day elapse . Prior radiation permit provide minimum 28 day elapse . Surgery permit provide least 3 week elapse . Prior hormone therapy permit . Patients must life expectancy ≥ 12 week . Metastatic locally recurrent disease incurable standard treatment . Acceptable endorgan function . ECOG 0 , 1 2. granulocyte ≥1.5x10/9/L platelet ≥100x10/9/L bilirubin ≤UNL potassium ≤UNL calcium , magnesium within normal limit AST , ALT ≤2.5 x UNL serum creatinine ≤UNL creatinine clearance ≥50mL/min QTc ≤450m sec LVEF ≥50 % Troponin I T ≤ UNL Cardiac exclusion ; Patients preexist uncontrolled cardiac condition . History myocardial infarction time past . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumor curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . Patients document CNS metastasis , unless adequately treat radiation least 30 day prior enrollment . Patients concurrent anticonvulsant dexamethasone control symptom . Patients leptomeningeal disease , even treatment , enrol due generally poor prognosis . Inability take oral medication . Patients must able swallow SB939 capsule gastrointestinal abnormality ( e.g . bowel obstruction previous gastric resection ) would lead inadequate absorption SB939 . Previous treatment HDAC inhibitor . Treatment another investigational therapy anticancer therapy within 28 day prior study entry . Known HIV , hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Dysrhythmic drug use agent know risk Torsades De Pointe permit study . A comprehensive list find http : //torsades.org . Presence chronic medical condition comorbidity pulmonary disease , active CNS disease , active infection , psychiatric condition , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation/study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result . Women men sterile unless use adequate method birth control . Female patient postmenopausal least 12 month surgically sterile consider sterile .</criteria>
