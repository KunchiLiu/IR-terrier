	<brief_title>Evaluation Diagnostic Performance MRI±Biopsy Optimize Resection Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ( DCIS ) Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) frequent disease , concern 15 % breast carcinoma France . Frequency increase due breast screen program . Breast conservative treatment do limited lesion . Complete pathological excision safe surgical margin main factor success rate conservative treatment . But safe surgical margin always obtain first surgery preoperative peroperative evaluation extent lesion difficult . A 20 38 % rate involve margin report literature , imply second surgery . MRI commonly perform today preoperative staging DCIS , despite interesting result breast MRI DCIS evaluation publish recently German study ( Kuhl , Lancet 2007 ) . Nevertheless , retrospective study focus population high-risk woman ( BRCA1-2 mutation carrier , family history breast cancer… ) . Additional suspicious lesion detect MRI require MRI-guided CT-guided biopsy detectable mammography ultrasound . Moreover , intraoperative pathological analysis perform DCIS surgical strategy different unique lesion ( lumpectomy ) multiple/large lesion ( mastectomy ) . If surgery adapt accord MRI biopsy result , assume entire lesion could remove single operation , avoid re-excisions , anxiety reducing cost . The main objective protocol evaluate value MRI+biopsy stag mammography-detected DCIS unselected population woman . It multicentric , randomise study include patient France present unique , limited ( &lt; 30 mm ) DCIS detect mammography breast ultrasound . The two compare arm : preoperative breast MRI+biopsy versus additional diagnostic examination . High resolution dynamic 3D image obtain order detect small suspicious lesion , typical DCIS . The main endpoint re-excision rate involve margin . In order show reduction 50 % rate second surgery ( 25 % 12.5 % MRI arm ) , necessary include 360 patient ( bilateral test , alpha=5 % , power=80 % ) . A cost-effective study perform . The cost likely differ two arm ( MRI , biopsy , outpatient visit , hospitalisation , transportation , sick leaf ) assess use data collect trial . The endpoint cost-effectiveness study cost success ( cost-effectiveness ratio ) . A success define achieve margin-negative resection initial surgery ( need re-excision ) . The secondary endpoint determine rate initial mastectomy describe MRI morphologic feature MRI+biopsy arm .</detailed_description>
