	<brief_title>An Inpatient Performance Evaluation New Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first generation Medtronic MiniMed Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor ( Sof-Sensor ) originally approve FDA commercialization part Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( CGMS ) June 15 , 1999 ( PMA 980022 ) . The Sensor compose microelectrode thin coat glucose oxidase beneath several layer biocompatible membrane . This sensor use part subsequent continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) system , Guardian REAL-Time Paradigm REAL-Time sensor augment insulin pump . The current configuration sensor undergone vitro vivo test . A new second-generation glucose sensor ( herein refer Comfort Sensor ) develop . The first-generation glucose sensor approve report sensor accuracy ( MAD ) 18 % ; label maximum use duration 72 hour , use abdomen insertion site . The new sensor short small diameter , small gauge introducer needle . The new sensor inserter design use new sensor . The objective study 1 ) Assess performance Comfort Sensor use period seven day currently available device , 2 ) Assess performance Comfort Sensor use period seven day use new calibration algorithm ( post-processed algorithm future device ) . Accuracy data calculate base compare calibrate glucose sensor value `` gold standard '' ( YSI plasma glucose value ) adult subject in-clinic testing , compare calibrate glucose sensor value glucose meter value in-home testing . The device use gather sensor data study : 1 ) Comfort Sensor , 2 ) MiniLink ( Transmitter ) , 3 ) Guardian REAL-Time Display Device 4 ) CGMS iPro .</detailed_description>
