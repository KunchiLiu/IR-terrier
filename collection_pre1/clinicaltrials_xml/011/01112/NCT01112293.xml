	<brief_title>Anti-TGF Monoclonal Antibody ( GC1008 ) Relapsed Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary : - To assess progression-free survival rate three month Secondary : - To determine toxicity safety systemic infusion anti-TGF beta antibody three-week dosing interval . - To assess time progression overall survival - assess response rate use Modified RECIST Criteria Mesothelioma Additional Objectives : - To assess efficacy use serial measurement serum [ intrapleural , indwell catheter place ] biomarkers , include serum-mesothelin related peptide ( SMRP/MesomarkÂ® ) osteopontin . - To assess systemic [ intrapleural indwelling catheter place ] humoral anti-tumor immune response repeat anti-TGF beta antibody instillation . - To assess systemic [ intrapleural , indwell catheter place ] TGF beta , cytokine level repeat anti-TGF beta antibody instillation . - To assess biologic response measurement TGF beta blockade serum test pleural fluid biopsy tissue available .</detailed_description>

Documented progressive disease evaluable Modified RECIST criterion . [ Progressive symptom 1st line therapy absence objective progression acceptable criterion enrollment ] . Patients previous extrapleural pneumonectomy disease recurrence eligible exclusion criterion . ECOG Performance status 0 1 . Greater equal 18 year age . Male female patient childproducing potential must agree use effective contraception enrol study receive experimental drug , least 3 month last treatment . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior begin treatment trial . Must able willing give write informed consent . Patients may consent durable power attorney . Serum albumin great equal 2.5 Adequate organ function Patients must negative test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis virus B C ( antibody and/or antigen ) unless result consistent prior vaccination prior infection full recovery . At time enrollment , patient must great 3 week since major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ( great equal 6 week treat nitrosourea , mitomycin monoclonal antibody ) , immunotherapy , biotherapy/targeted therapy recover toxicity prior treatment le equal Grade 1 , exclusive alopecia . Concurrent nonprotocol cancer therapy permit . ( In patient receive long act agent , treatment free interval 2 half life consider . ) Note : Although patient enter criterion , patient le 36 month radiotherapy talc pleurodesis , FDGPET scan useful . 12 ) . Known central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases , meningeal carcinomatosis , malignant seizure , disease either cause threatens neurologic compromise ( e.g. , unstable vertebral metastasis ) . Presence pericardial effusion Rapidly reaccumulating , symptomatic malignant pleural effusion statuspost thoracentesis pleural catheter insertion require immediate mechanical chemical pleurodesis adequate palliation . Active thrombophlebitis , thromboembolism , hypercoagulability state , bleeding , use anticoagulation therapy ( include lovenox , warfarin , anti platelet agent aspirin [ exception low dose ASA ~ 81 mg/d ] , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , dipyridamole , agent use induce longacting platelet dysfunction ) . Patients history deep venous thrombosis may participate successfully treat , completely resolve , treatment give great 4 month . Pregnant nursing woman , due unknown effect GC1008 develop fetus newborn infant . Other active invasive malignancy require ongoing therapy . Patients organ transplant , include receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant . Use investigational agent within 4 week prior study enrollment ( within 6 week treatment longacting agent monoclonal antibody ) . Patients immunosuppressive therapy Significant uncontrolled medical illness , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , myocardial infarction , symptomatic coronary artery disease , significant ventricular arrhythmia within last 6 month , significant pulmonary dysfunction . Patients remote history asthma active mild asthma may participate . Active infection , include active herpes zoster , well unexplained fever ( temperature 38.1C ) , antibiotic therapy within 1 week prior enrollment . Systemic autoimmune disease ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosus , active rheumatoid arthritis , etc. ) . Positive stool fecal occult blood test ( patient positive need standard GI workup consist Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) Colonoscopy ) prior enrollment rule possible reason bleed . A patient eligible negative result exam . Active GI bleeding within past 5 year due benign anorectal cause hemorrhoid , fissure stricture . A known allergy component GC1008 . Patients , opinion Investigator , significant medical psychosocial problem warrant exclusion .</criteria>
