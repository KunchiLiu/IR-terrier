	<brief_title>NETs Formation Patients With Recurrent Pyogenic Infections ( NETS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our laboratory Meir Medical Center , Kfar Saba , country 's main center neutrophil function , serve 80 % Israel 's population . Patients refer subsequent recurrent , persistent , unusual infection complete preliminary screen immune system rule humoral , cellular complement immune deficiency . Initial workup include chemotaxis , superoxide production ( SOP ) , bactericidal activity ( BA ) . Based test finding , evaluation qualitative phagocytic disorder conduct . Overall , impairment phagocytic activity find 33 % ( impaired chemotaxis 16 % , SOP 6 % , BA 24 % ) . In 67 % , impairment immune function find explain tendency recurrent pyogenic infection . In 2004 novel function neutrophil identify : formation neutrophil extracellular trap ( NETs ) . Apparently , neutrophil able extrude part cellular content form DNA , histones protease , form extra cellular NETS trap kill bacterial pathogen without need phagocytosis . We aim study pathological NETs formation could underlie pathology among patient recurrent infection normal screen immune system .</detailed_description>
