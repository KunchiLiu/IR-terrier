	<brief_title>VenaTech Convertible Vena Cava Filter U.S. Multi-Center Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigation design multi-center , prospective , single-arm , historical ( literature ) control clinical study VenaTech Convertible filter safety performance 75 subject filter implant , convert , follow 6-months . The study could enroll 323 patient ensure 75 converted subject 6 month follow-up data . Converted subject follow 30-days , 3-months , 6-months post conversion . Subjects unable undergo conversion follow 6-months post filter implant ( permanent filtration subject ) . Study subject identify pool candidate time-limited risk pulmonary embolism . Subjects sign informed consent evaluate determine eligibility study base inclusion exclusion criterion . Following completion baseline procedure include bilateral Doppler ultrasound legs assess baseline DVT contrast venacavography ass baseline IVC diameter , subject underwent implantation VenaTech Convertible filter . After device implant , clinical assessment complete determine eligibility filter conversion . This assessment do interval post-implant frequency per investigator 's discretion , often input primary care physician . If clinician determine subject long risk pulmonary embolism , thrombus filter , clinically significant deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) leg , filter could convert . After conversion , subject follow 30 day 3-months telephone , 6-months post-conversion office visit imaging ( KUB spot film Doppler CT ) . If conversion clinical assessment ( ) , subject remain risk pulmonary embolism , additional conversion assessment ( ) complete per investigator 's discretion filter either convert subject determined require permanent filtration . At 6-months post-implant , study subject 's filter convert , conversion assessment perform attempt make convert filter part study . The 6-month post filter implant visit final follow-up nonconverted subject , also include imaging ( KUB spot film Doppler CT ) . The study protocol allow investigator flexibility best IVC image modality base condition anatomy subject . The core laboratory review screening/baseline , filter implantation , conversion eligibility assessment , conversion , 6-month follow-up image , exception ultrasound . ( The core laboratory recommend ultrasound image evaluate expert sonographers site ) . Additionally , image take result suspect filter-related adverse event technical complication , exception ultrasound , also send core laboratory review .</detailed_description>
