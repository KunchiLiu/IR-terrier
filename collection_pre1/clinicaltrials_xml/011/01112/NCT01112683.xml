	<brief_summary>The purpose 16-week research study determine whether drug call memantine hydrochloride ( memantine ) potential help improve memory cognitive ability young adult Down syndrome ( DS ) . Memantine ( Namenda® ) drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) patient moderate severe Alzheimer-type dementia . About 40 person gender Down syndrome age 18-32 year take part study . This randomized double blind study . This mean subject 50/50 chance assign receive either memantine pill placebo ( inactive pill ) . Neither study participant research personnel know receive active medication placebo . Based memantine 's mode action , current knowledge brain pathology person Down syndrome , preclinical data mouse model Down syndrome , hypothesize memantine may improve test score young adult Down Syndrome memory test target function brain structure call hippocampus . This research project three specific aim : 1 ) investigate whether memantine potential improve test score hippocampus-dependent measure young adult Down syndrome ; 2 ) investigate whether memantine potential improve test score subject cognitive measure ; 3 ) investigate whether memantine well tolerated subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Down syndrome , result trisomy Chromosome 21 , common genetically define cause intellectual disability . The estimated number people Down syndrome United States approximately 300,000 , figure expect continue increase due project increase life expectancy people Down syndrome . Although population trend reflect improvement general health care individual Down syndrome , parallel progress understanding pathogenesis potential treatment psychological neurological component genetic condition . These include various degree intellectual disability , increase incidence seizure disorder relation general population , motor dysfunction ( include hypotonia ) , abnormal oculomotor vestibular function , substantial visual deficit , neuropathology indistinguishable Alzheimer disease , increase incidence major depression dementia adult . Over last fifteen year , progress quantitative description specific trait associate Down syndrome , availability postnatal-viable aneuploid mouse model Down syndrome , progressively sophisticated knowledge human mouse genome provide investigator field realistic opportunity start bridge gap basic clinical research . Whereas individual Down syndrome maintain relatively high level social intelligence procedural learning , often suffer grossly impaired declarative explicit memory . Not surprisingly , brain structure associate declarative memory , namely hippocampal parahippocampal region medial temporal lobe , severely affected person Down syndrome . The nature deficits suggest therapy target hippocampal function would particularly efficacious ameliorate cognitive deficit see person Down syndrome , consequently , would enhance quality life . Glutamatergic neuron form major excitatory system brain play pivotal role many physiological function . Apart physiological role glutamate , excessive activation receptor also evoke neuronal dysfunction even damage/death . Cell death ascribe excessive activation glutamate receptor term 'excitotoxicity ' seem occur acute insult stroke trauma , may also associate chronic neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer disease . N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor ( NMDAR ) mediate glutamate excitotoxicity think play major role Aβ-induced neuronal death . This idea part foundation glutamatergic hypothesis ( oppose cholinergic hypothesis ) Alzheimer disease . Memantine NMDAR antagonist report effective therapeutically Alzheimer disease . It available Germany well European Union two decade . Recently , approve moderate severe dementia US . The chemical name memantine hydrochloride 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane hydrochloride . Memantine uncompetitive , moderate affinity , antagonist NMDARs . It propose therapeutic dos drug inhibit pathological effect NMDAR activation leave unaffected NMDAR-mediated physiological process involve learning memory . Recent preclinical data laboratory trial 's P.I . mouse model DS ( Ts65Dn ) suggest dysregulation NMDAR activity animal demonstrate improvement learn memory measure use acute dos memantine . In clinical trial far , memantine find safe well tolerate . The tolerability NMDAR antagonist depend upon affinity towards receptor , unbind kinetics , voltage dependency . Memantine think improve fidelity synaptic transmission . Such action predict provide neuroprotection symptomatic restoration synaptic plasticity one mechanism . Recent open-label study suggest memantine may clinically useful well tolerate young individual condition produce cognitive disability , autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . Because ubiquity Alzheimer disease-type pathology person Down syndrome , preclinical finding consistent dysregulation NMDAR activity mouse model Down syndrome , safety profile memantine ( superior AChE inhibitor already test person Down syndrome ) , possibility memantine may indeed delay onset Alzheimer disease-type pathology young adult Down syndrome , professional involve project decide small-scale randomized control clinical trial warrant present . We would like emphasize goal study evaluate efficacy , tolerability safety memantine hydrochloride enhance cognitive ability young adult Down syndrome age 18-32 year . Therefore , present investigation non-overlapping complementary clinical trial randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial efficacy tolerability memantine prevent age-related cognitive deterioration dementia people Down syndrome age 40 ( http : //www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT00240760 ? term=down+syndrome &amp; rank=15 ) currently carry colleague London .</detailed_description>
