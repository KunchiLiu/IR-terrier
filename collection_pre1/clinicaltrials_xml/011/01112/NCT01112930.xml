	<detailed_description>This research involve recruitment cross-sectional cohort child 5 year age mother . The purpose ass relationship child 's diet , DHA status neural , cognitive behavioral development . Hypotheses : 1 . Children low DHA status increase risk poor score test development . 2 . Family food practice major determinant DHA intake preschool child population . 3 . Genetic variation fatty acid metabolism influence blood fatty acid preschool child . Objectives : 1 . To determine low DHA status among child 5-6 years-of-age associate low score test development ; 2 . To identify dietary pattern place child risk poor DHA status , 3 . To show genetic variation also alter blood fatty acid child . This research recruit cohort 5-6year-old child ( n= 200 ) . Subjects attend nutrition lab Child Family Research Institute child complete play-like developmental assessment . Measurement blood pressure , heart rate , height weight complete blood sample collect measure DHA status polymorphism ( SNP ) gene fatty acid metabolism . The parent ask provide information child ' diet health . Baseline characteristic subject summarize use descriptive statistic . Logistic regression use ass relationship DHA status cognitive development multi-variable-adjusted odds ratio ( ORs ) negative outcome correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) . Regressions also run outcomes continuous form ass change score associate increment child DHA status . For multivariate regression model , potential confounders screen stepwise fashion , covariate regression coefficient P-value &lt; 0.05 ( two-sided ) retain . Variables include gender , birth weight , gestation length , maternal intelligence quotient ( IQ ) , ethnicity , breast-feeding duration , birth order , dichotomize variable child health , eat behavior martial status . Children group quintiles blood DHA descriptive statistic use present intake total fat , individual fatty acid . ANOVA use determine genetic variable Fetal Akinesia Deformation Sequence ( FADS ) influence blood DHA .</detailed_description>
