	<brief_summary>In response European regulatory authority , GSK conduct post-marketing observational study ass efficacy Relenza use prophylaxis influenza . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . Determine frequency patient receive Relenza October 2006 April 2009 , among number concurrent diagnosis influenza , i.e. , receive Relenza prophylaxis , among number family member medical visit influenza within three day precede indentified patient 's dispensing Relenza . This determine feasibility conduct detailed analysis . 2 . If analysis feasible tabulate frequency influenza-like-illness respiratory outcomes user prophylactic Relenza family member family member person use Relenza treatment influenza ( i.e. , index case ) . 3 . If analysis feasible estimate direct effect prophylactic Relenza occurrence influenza-like-illness respiratory outcome , secondary effect Relenza treatment influenza susceptible family member , total effect Relenza ( treatment plus prophylaxis ) . METHODS Overview Study Design This analysis 30-day risk influenza-like illness respiratory outcome person household member ( index case ) medical visit associate diagnosis influenza . The exposed individual index case categorize one four cohort accord whether exposed person receive prophylactic Relenza antiviral treatment whether index family member diagnosis influenza receive antiviral treatment . Estimates direct effect Relenza prophylaxis , indirect effectof prevent disease susceptible family member , total effect disease reduction index case susceptible family member treat obtained different comparison cohort , outline . The research cover first three influenza season Relenza indicate prophylactic use United States . These October April 2006-2009 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>***Patients recruit enrolled study . This study retrospective observational study . Data medical record insurance claim database anonymised use develop patient cohort . All diagnosis treatment record course routine medical practice . *** This analysis use i3 Ingenix proprietary National Health Information ( NHI ) database , contain claim enrollment data back 1993 , opportunity link patient physician survey data pharmacy medical claim , clinical laboratory result . These data use wide range pharmacoepidemiologic , healthcare utilization , economic analysis . In addition data derive affiliated health plan , data large , national employer group also store database . The data undergo regular audit quality control procedure . The accessible information include demographic , pharmacy use , medical facility claim , provide data service , procedure , accompany diagnosis . Underlying information geographically diverse across US , update frequently . The insured population database draw data comprises approximately 4 percent US population . The data use analysis de-identified . Study Cohorts From October 2006 April 2009 , count patient receive prophylactic Relenza , define dispense Relenza person meet two criterion : ( 1 ) diagnosis influenza associate medical care day dispense precede three day , ( 2 ) household member diagnosis influenza associate medical care day index dispense within precede three day . `` Household member '' define operationally person within RDM share common family identifier address . We assemble study cohort 3 influenza season run October 2006 April 2009 . Cohort membership base treatment individual receive nature household exposure . Exclusion criterion include : - Sex unknown - Year birth miss date dispensing service date precede year birth - Age index date le 5 year - Not enrol health plan 6 month prior study entry date Observation begin prophylaxis treated patient day follow Relenza dispense non-prophylaxis untreated patient third day follow medical visit , continue total 30 day . Covariates For individual identify age , sex , medical condition require care six month precede cohort entry insurance claim health service . Medical condition require care define 3-digit ICD9 diagnostic level . Outcomes We identify medical visit hospitalization influenza-like illness respiratory disease 30 day follow cohort entry . Analysis Within category age 5-14 , 15-44 , 45-64 65+ year , tabulate : - number individual four cohort ( cohort define ) - number medical visit influenza-like illness respiratory illness 30-day follow-up period For outcome estimate follow antiviral efficacy measure detail Halloran 's analysis clinical trial data [ Halloran , 2007 ] . The first two effect standardization age distribution person receive prophylactic Relenza ; 1 . Direct Effect Relenza Prophylaxis : Risk Cohort 1 less Risk Cohort 3 Prophylaxis patient untreated index case v patient without prophylaxis untreated index 2 . Total Effect Relenza Prophylaxis Treatment : Risk Cohort 2 less Risk Cohort 3 Prophylaxis patient treat index case vs. patient without prophylaxis untreated index We calculate follow effect estimate standardization age distribution untreated person . 3 . Protective Effect Relenza Prophylaxis Susceptible : Risk Cohort 2 less Risk Cohort 4 Prophylaxis patient treat index case vs. patient without prophylaxis treat index Using binomial regression linear risk model , obtain adjusted estimate Direct Effect , Total Effect , Protective Effect , define , adjusted age group , sex , diagnosis prevalence least 10 percent cohort combine .</detailed_description>
