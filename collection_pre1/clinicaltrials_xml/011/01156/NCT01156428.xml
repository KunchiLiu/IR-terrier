	<brief_summary>This study evaluate patient kidney disease , role certain inflammatory immune mediator play promote kidney damage . The investigator hypothesize certain mediator , ( identify serum , urine renal biopsy tissue ) , patient variety different renal disease state provide information regard clinical course inflammatory immune pattern serum urine patient kidney disease may yield predictive diagnostic information place renal biopsy . The ability detect quantify mediator may lead early detection treatment kidney disease order prevent kidney failure requirement renal replacement . The study evaluate serum , blood urine collect one year period post kidney biopsy presence inflammatory immune mediator , correlate kidney pathology finding ( gene signature ) . These gene signature compare `` normal '' control specimens obtain donor transplant kidney normal kidney tissue obtain patient require entire kidney remove tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate human inflammatory immune mediator may play role kidney damage . The investigator hypothesize certain inflammatory immune mediator identify serum and/or urine patient variety different renal disease state provide prognostic information regard clinical course . Furthermore , hypothesize RNA transcriptional profile renal biopsy specimen identify gene array pattern provide prognostic information various disease state . Lastly , hypothesize pattern inflammatory immune mediator identify serum and/or urine may yield predictive diagnostic information lieu renal biopsy . The ability detect quantify mediator may lead early detection treatment prior progression Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) stage 4 and/or 5 . The study evaluate serially collect serum , blood urine one-year period post kidney biopsy presence inflammatory immune mediator . The blood , serum urine inflammatory immune mediator correlate kidney pathology gene signature . Note biopsy conduct base upon clinical indication purpose study . Renal pathology gene signature obtain study subject compare `` normal '' control specimens . Normal specimen obtain donor transplant kidney nephrectomy specimen perform patient undergo nephrectomy clinical indication identify renal mass . Representative `` normal '' tissue obtain nephrectomized kidney site distant renal mass .</detailed_description>
