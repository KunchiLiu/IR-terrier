	<brief_title>Effects Pioglitazone High-density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) Function Persons With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) pharmacological ligand nuclear receptor peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPAR-γ ) . When activate , receptor bind response element DNA , alter transcription variety gene regulate carbohydrate lipid metabolism1 . The hypoglycemic insulin sensitize effect PIO TZD compound well established2-4 . The prominent effect increase insulin-stimulated glucose uptake skeletal muscle cells5,6 . The receptor highly express adipocytes , expression myocytes comparatively minor . Therefore , increase glucose uptake muscle may largely indirect effect mediate TZD interaction adipocytes7-9 . Candidates intermediary signal fat muscle include leptin , free fatty acid , tumor necrosis factor-α , adiponectin , resistin . T2D associate cluster lipid lipoprotein abnormality include reduced HDL , elevate triglyceride predominance small dense LDL particles10 . Altered metabolism triglyceride rich lipoproteins crucial pathophysiology diabetic dyslipidemia . Alterations include increase hepatic production delay clearance plasma large low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) intestinal chylomicron . Increased level particle also result increase production small dense low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . The reduction high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) associate T2D appear relate CETP-mediated transfer cholesterol HDL triglyceride rich particle exchange triglyceride . The triglyceride rich HDL hydrolyze hepatic lipase , reduce particle size , rapidly clear circulation11 . Reduced HDL due mostly decrease HDL2 , however , increased level small HDL3 12 . In addition ability induce insulin sensitivity T2D subject , TZDs also certain lipid benefit . HDL cholesterol concentration often increase TZD therapy triglyceride concentration frequently fall13 . A nonrandomized clinical comparison potential difference lipid effect among TZDs14 demonstrate beneficial effect lipid pioglitazone ( PIO ) least rosiglitazone ( ROSI ) 15 . These observation confirm study investigate lipid-lowering effect TZDs show PIO associate significantly great improvement triglyceride , HDL cholesterol , non-HDL cholesterol , LDL particle size compare ROSI 16 . The mechanism ( ) agent exert differential effect lipid profile clearly understood . Whether difference lipid effect translate difference risk CVD clear . Trials determine effect pioglitazone rosiglitazone CVD outcomes underway identify cardiovascular benefit two drug . Lipid metabolism play central role development atherosclerosis . Elevated LDL decrease HDL cholesterol important risk factor development coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . The major cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein blood LDL many study show independent relationship LDL cholesterol atherosclerosis non-diabetic diabetic subjects17 . The metabolism HDL , inversely relate risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , involve complex interplay factor regulate HDL synthesis , intravascular remodeling , catabolism18 . The anti-atherogenic property HDL attribute , least part , ability HDL promote cholesterol removal ( efflux ) cell , first step reverse cholesterol transport pathway 19 . Reduced HDL T2D result increase clearance small HDL particles20 , PIO treatment subject raise HDL level 10-15 % yet poorly define mechanism . Studies Ginsberg colleagues21 , elegant study , examine effect PIO treatment patient T2D various aspect lipoprotein metabolism . PIO raise HDL cholesterol level 14 % , change apoA-I production rate , fall apoA-I synthetic rate observe PIO therapy22 . ApoA-I synthesis regulate several transcription factor , include PPAR-α ; evidence PPAR-α play role apoA-I synthesis vivo , although PIO ROSI report stimulate apoA-I secretion HepG2 cells23 . The author suggest rise HDL may result reduce CETP-mediated exchange VLDL triglycerides HDL cholesterol , concomitant PIO-associated fall VLDL level reduce mass activity HL thus increase HDL level . There publish data regard PPAR-γ agonist HL activity , author find change HL mass preheparin serum PIO treatment . A final possibility propose author PPAR-γ signaling may play role stimulate expression gene encode ABCA1 could increase flux cholesterol cell onto nascent apoA-I . Study Aims Characterize structural functional change plasma lipid lipoprotein T2D subject PIO treatment . A major emphasis compare serum HDL function relate reverse cholesterol transport plasma lipoproteins baseline PIO treatment . We hypothesize increased level HDL result PIO therapy affect particle size , density distribution lipid lipoprotein composition HDL change may alter activity several key step involve reverse cholesterol transport , namely ability promote cellular cholesterol efflux , cholesterol esterification LCAT transport esterify cholesterol HDL apoB contain lipoprotein .</detailed_description>
