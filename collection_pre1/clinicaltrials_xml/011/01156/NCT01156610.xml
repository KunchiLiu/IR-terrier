	<brief_summary>The objective project develop evaluate multi-level approach tobacco treatment low-SES minority patient . The component intervention would include Integrated Voice Response ( IVR ) -facilitated systematic outreach , linkage tobacco treatment specialist , free Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) direct patient , integration program individual 's primary care physician electronic health record ( EHR ) , well referral community resource address socio-contextual barrier tobacco cessation . To achieve objective , intervention test innovative model systematic outreach low-SES minority smoker use systematic phone outreach ( include cell phone particularly prevalent among minority low-SES group ) , coordinate PCP , use cost-effective technology dedicate tobacco treatment specialist increase smoke cessation population . The propose intervention multiple level influence ( patient , PCP ) provide linkages community resource . If successful , model could generalize health system EHR , increasingly promote improve safety quality health care . Hypothesis 1 ( Reach Effectiveness ) : An EHR-linked , IVR-mediated personalized treatment program low-SES minority smoker reach patient increase quit rate use tobacco treatment effectively . Hypothesis 2 ( Adoption Implementation ) : An EHR-linked , IVR-mediated personalized treatment program low-SES minority smoker adopt across variety practice setting consistently implement across diverse patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tobacco Treatment Outreach Reduce Disparities Primary Care Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because 70 % smoker see PCP within past year , primary care represent valuable platform reduce disparity tobacco use could make effective . The current national focus expand use EHRs also make propose model identify smoker goal reduce disparity tobacco use particularly timely . The adoption EHRs practice serve minority similar practice , suggest `` digital divide '' PCP practice . In addition , propose intervention novel address tobacco use multiple level ( i.e. , individual , health care set , community ) , design provide smoker tool address socio-contextual contributor disparity tobacco use . Finally , intervention inform broad approach use community resource tobacco cessation . Conceptual model empiric data suggest type broad approach need reach low-SES minority smoker reduce disparity tobacco use . Telephone outreach may particularly effective minority low-SES population cell phone penetration high population . While disparity tobacco use root social economic problem extend beyond domain health care traditional treatment model , health care system still represent critical opportunity initiate intervention . Although smoking decline past decade , substantial socioeconomic disparity smoke prevalence , risk addiction , tobacco-related disease remain US , particularly among different racial , ethnic , socioeconomic group . Despite relatively similar rate tobacco use , example , African Americans ( term use interchangeably `` black '' throughout proposal ) suffer high burden tobacco-related disease , particularly lung cancer , white . Importantly , low socioeconomic status ( SES ) minority smoker also relatively difficult time quit several reason , include limited access treatment , misinformation risk benefit treatment , environmental exposure , lack social support , life stressor . Primary care physician ( PCPs ) important source tobacco treatment , majority smoker visit PCP year . While US Public Health Service strongly recommend clinician identify treat every tobacco user , approach largely dependent busy clinician provide counsel treatment brief visit . Minority low-SES smoker likely white report receive counseling treatment visit . For reason important offer systematic opportunity tobacco treatment beyond provider 's office , addition improve `` best practice '' cessation treatment . Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) phone technology allow computer detect voice response normal phone call ( include call mobile phone ) . This technology offer low-cost , efficient way reach proactively large population , independent visit . IVR script translate language , facilitate systematic outreach diverse population . This technology provide direct linkage tobacco treatment specialist , provide personalized advice cessation , mood management , stress reduction , provide course free nicotine replacement treatment ( NRT ) , well linkage relevant community resource . Smokers use NRT part cessation plan likely succeed , free NRT particularly important intervention low-SES minority smoker . Specific Aim 1 : To develop EHR-linked , IVR-mediated personalized tobacco treatment program low-SES minority smoker . To develop program , first conduct formative qualitative research identify particular barrier smoke cessation face population subsequently , create Community Resource Guide address socio-cultural barrier cessation . Specific Aim 2 : To measure effectiveness personalize treatment program conduct randomize control trial low-SES minority smoker 12 clinic Partners Primary Care Practice Based Research Network ( PPC-PBRN ) . Patients intervention group offer three contact tobacco treatment specialist 12 week period , free 6-week supply nicotine patch , linkage local resource use Community Resource Guide . Patients control group receive visit-based `` best practice '' care facilitate EHR decision support ( receive intervention control group ) . The primary outcome trial 7-day abstinence rate 6 month . Specific Aim 3 : To evaluate facilitator barrier reach , adoption , implementation personalize tobacco treatment program . This project fit well project Lung Cancer Disparities Center ( LCDC ) , complement project seek explain disparity lung cancer molecular , neighborhood , societal level . Over 80 % diagnosed lung cancer current ex-smokers , support critical importance smoking cessation reduce disparity lung cancer.1 Our project add another layer focus individual/ clinical interface reduce disparity tobacco use .</detailed_description>
