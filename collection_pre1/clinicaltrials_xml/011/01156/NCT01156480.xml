	<brief_summary>Despite modern medical advance , necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) remain significant problem neonatal intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . Although research show NEC inflammatory necrosis bowel , date study examine effect anti-inflammatory therapy dread disease diagnose . The investigator propose multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded pilot study examine effect hydrocortisone infant diagnose stage II III NEC .

	<detailed_description>Given extensive inflammatory response inherent NEC , anti-inflammatory treatment may benefit , reduce inflammation potential therapy improve outcome . To date , specific therapy NEC find improve outcome , corticosteroid yet investigate capacity . Therefore , propose examine effect hydrocortisone treatment NEC randomize , blind , placebo-controlled pilot study , focus primary outcome C-reactive protein level 3 7 day therapy measure inflammation . In addition , follow several secondary outcome measure determine possibility improve outcome infant assign hydrocortisone . The investigator hypothesize infant diagnose NEC receive hydrocortisone significantly low C-reactive protein level 3 7 day treatment versus infant receive placebo .</detailed_description>
