	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Comparison Trial Use Mifepristone With Sublingual Buccal Misoprostol Medical Abortions Less Than 9 Weeks Gestation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After mifepristone approve United States Food Drug Administration 2000 , combination mifepristone 200 mg vaginal use misoprostol 800 mcg become almost standard care early medical abortion 63 day gestation . When combined mifepristone medical abortion first trimester , vaginal administration misoprostol effective , faster , low rate ongoing pregnancy , few gastrointestinal side effect oral misoprostol . Although misoprostol effective give vaginally , woman prefer oral route avoid uncomfortable vaginal examination provide privacy medical induction . Another concern vaginal administration potential risk infection . In late March 2006 , analyse serious uterine infection follow medical abortion regimen oral mifepristone follow vaginal misoprostol lead Planned Parenthood Federation America health centre change route misoprostol administration . Given concern , alternative administration via sublingual ( hold pill tongue ) buccal ( hold pill cheek ) rout investigated , misoprostol absorb directly avoid gastrointestinal system similar vaginal administration . A pharmacokinetic study show sublingual administration misoprostol result great bioavailability compare oral vaginal administration . In randomized , cross-over pharmacokinetic study 10 woman Schaff colleague sublingual versus buccal misoprostol 800 mcg , mean misoprostol plasma concentration-time curve 4 hour maximum concentration significantly high sublingual administration buccal route . However , buccal misoprostol administration result few symptom found acceptable woman . Buccal misoprostol 800 mcg mifepristone 200 mg terminate pregnancy 63 day gestation high success rate less ongoing pregnancy compare oral misoprostol , especially pregnancies 57-63 day . Adverse effect profile similar , although fever chill report approximately 10 % often among woman take buccal misoprostol . When used abortion 56 day gestation , buccal administration misoprostol mifepristone appear highly effective acceptable alternative compare vaginal administration , similar adverse effect profile . Medical abortion less 9 week gestation use sublingual misoprostol 800 mcg mifepristone 200 mg achieve complete abortion rate 98.2 % associate gastrointestinal side effect , fever , chill compare vaginal route . Both buccal sublingual administration misoprostol follow mifepristone show effective inducing first trimester medical abortion , different side effect profile . No clinical trial conduct compare buccal sublingual administration misoprostol first trimester medical abortion . The purpose present study compare incidence side effect buccal sublingual misoprostol combine mifepristone .</detailed_description>
