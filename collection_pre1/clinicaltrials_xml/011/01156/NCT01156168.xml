	<brief_title>Biomarkers Tissue Samples From Patients With Breast Cancer Treated With Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To demonstrate vascular endothelial growth factor-A ( VEGFA ) haplotypes associate increased VEGFA expression predict superior outcome patient metastatic breast cancer receive bevacizumab ECOG-E2100 ( control arm ) . - To demonstrate candidate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) improve predictive capacity outcome ( efficacy toxicity ) patient enrol ECOG-E2100 . - To demonstrate tumor VEGFA amplification borderline amplification ( estimate 14 % frequency ) predict superior outcome patient metastatic breast cancer receive bevacizumab ECOG-E2100 whereas VEGFA deletion ( estimate 11 % frequency ) predict inferior outcome . - To demonstrate VEGFA amplification/deletion predict outcome control arm ECOG-E2100 . Secondary - To demonstrate tumor VEGFA amplification predict increase protein expression ascertain IHC . - To demonstrate combine algorithm calculate tumor-specific variability ( VEGFA amplification/deletion ) host-specific variability ( SNPs ) optimally predict outcome ( efficacy ) bevacizumab patient enrol ECOG-E2100 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Previously collect tumor-derived DNA analyze VEGFA amplification/deletion haplotype biomarkers outcome bevacizumab treatment . Gene expression , polymorphism , protein expression analysis , IHC perform sample .</detailed_description>
