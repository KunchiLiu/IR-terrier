	<brief_title>Hydrolized Protein Formula Premature Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study formula 100 % whey protein partially hydrolyze ( vs 60/40 Whey : Casein ratio regular premature formula ) Because tolerance availability breast milk predictable time enrollment eligible premature infant randomize assigned study control group . Infants receive formula , either breast milk available indicated attend physician switch formula , They feed , depend group assign , either PH formula study group regular premature formula control group . Randomization blind All eligible infant parental consent randomize either study group receive protein hydrolyze formula ( PH group ) control group receive standard premature formula . Randomization stratify 2 birth weight category ( 500-1000 g 1001-1500 g ) . The purpose stratification avoid imbalance group factor may influence outcome base different morbidity different birth weight category . Masked randomization perform way avoids possibility knowledge treatment assignment time eligibility assess consent sought . Only person charge prepare control study formula aware infant 's assignment group . Caregivers remain masked treatment group . Study population Preterm newborns admit neonatal intensive care unit birth weight 500-1500 g survive 3 day .</detailed_description>

Chromosomal anomaly . Major congenital anomaly ( complex cardiac anomaly , congenital hydrocephalus , renal dysplasia ) . Congenital ( e.g . jejunal atresia ) acquire ( e.g . GI perforation ) gastrointestinal pathology preclude oral feed and/or require major surgical medical intervention . Parental refusal . Prior enrollment conflict clinical trial . Conflicting clinical trial intervention could modify outcome present study , example study aim accelerate feed improve tolerance .</criteria>
