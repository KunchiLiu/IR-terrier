	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see whether CDX-011 effective treating patient advance breast cancer make protein call glycoprotein NMB ( GPNMB ) , already receive ( candidate ) available approved therapy breast cancer . This study also characterize safety CDX-011 treatment patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study CDX-011 ( CR011-vcMMAE ) Patients With Advanced GPNMB-expressing Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CDX-011 consist antibody attached drug , monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) , kill cancer cell . The antibody deliver drug cancer cell attach protein call glycoprotein NMB ( GPNMB ) express cancer cell . The MMAE release inside cell , interfere cell growth may lead cell death . This study examine effectiveness safety CDX-011 patient advance breast cancer make GPNMB protein . To good ass , effect CDX-011 compare treatment currently available cancer chemotherapy . Eligible patient enroll study randomly assign chance receive treatment CDX-011 chemotherapy chosen study doctor list currently available drug ( `` Investigator 's Choice '' chemotherapy ) . For three patient enrol , two receive CDX-011 one receive treatment `` Investigator 's Choice '' . Patients initially assign `` Investigator 's Choice '' chemotherapy may offer treatment CDX-011 cancer worsen initial treatment . All patient enrol study closely monitored determine cancer respond treatment , side effect may occur .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Among criterion , patient must meet following condition eligible study : 1 . 18 year age old . 2 . Locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . 3 . Previous treatment least two seven prior chemotherapy treatment progressive , recurrent metastatic breast cancer . 4 . Unless candidate agent , prior therapy must include taxane , anthracycline , capecitabine , well trastuzumab lapatinib patient whose tumor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . ( Patients receive incomplete course therapy agent due intolerance eligible . ) 5 . Breast cancer tumor confirm express GPNMB . This determine submit tissue sample ( obtain diagnostic biopsy surgery ) central laboratory analysis . Among criterion , patient meet follow condition NOT eligible study : 1 . Ongoing neuropathy chemotherapy radiationrelated toxicity moderate ( Grade 2 ) bad severity . 2 . Known brain metastasis , unless previously treat asymptomatic 2 month progressive size number 2 month . 3 . Significant cardiovascular disease underlie medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study treatment ( CDX011 chemotherapy ) hazardous would obscure interpretation side effect .</criteria>
