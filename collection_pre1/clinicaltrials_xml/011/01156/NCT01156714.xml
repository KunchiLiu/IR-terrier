	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) recognize motor nonmotor disorder . Gait mobility impairment often associate decline cognitive function , particularly executive function ( EF ) , among non-motor sign . EF broad category cognitive function generally define process necessary purposeful , goal-directed behavior supervision ongoing cognitive process . Deficits EF frequently see early PD4 progress time , often result disruption daily activity . People PD often impair real life situation one activity need performed time . Dual tasking ( DT ) define performance two different task simultaneously , commonly gait plus cognitive task . This study investigate interaction motor ( gait ) non-motor ( cognitive ) impairment PD . Studies DT suggest reciprocal interaction exist gait mental function fundamental performance daily activity . Therefore , model DT encompass 2 major area PD-related impairment single outcome measure highly correlate daily function . Performance DT generally result degradation gait and/or cognitive performance . The investigator ' pilot study 125 people PD show significant DT interference produce 22 % decline gait velocity . This demonstrate deterioration gait performance subject allocate attention cognitive task . Importantly , deficit DT correlate problem daily function , especially instrumental activity daily live ( IADLs ) , associate increase risk fall drive impairment . Similarly , investigator ' pilot data patient moderate stage PD show deficit DT performance associate poor IADL performance . Although cognitive deficit contribute disability PD , treatment effectively address problem , study systematically investigate potential benefit rehabilitation strategy improve cognitive function relate disability population . Emerging evidence suggest potential physical exercise cognitive training improve cognitive function healthy elderly individual chronic neurologic condition . A Cochrane meta-analysis cognitive effect aerobic exercise older adult show improvement peak VO2 level mean 14 % ( range 5-20 % ) associate improvement cognitive function , particularly EF domains include speed motor process attention . These EF domains deficit commonly occur PD . Pilot data investigator ' Baltimore VA study show investigator reproduce similar gain cardiopulmonary fitness PD , report Cochrane review , 3-month aerobic exercise program . The investigator ' group also report improvement select EF domain ( attention speed process ) follow 2 month aerobic exercise stroke patients12 . Cognitive training another potential rehabilitation modality improve cognitive function . Recent study numerous neurological condition healthy old adult show cognitive training improve cognition , EF likely respond among cognitive domain . In project , investigator compare effectiveness treadmill aerobic exercise program ( TAEX ) versus cognitive training program ( TCOG ) versus combination TAEX + TCOG improve EF , DT performance IADLs investigator ' sample Veterans others PD . The investigator also compare intervention control group , assess natural history EF investigator ' sample provide insight intervention may delay even reverse progression EF deficits PD . The investigator ' fundamental hypothesis 3 month combine TAEX+TCOG effective improving EF , DT performance , IADLs , compare either regimen alone compare `` intervention '' ( control group ) .</detailed_description>
