	<brief_summary>The primary study hypothesis investigator administration iron supplement meal dose like use Pemba trial ( ~1 mg Fe/kg ) P. falciparum parasitemia increase plasma non-transferrin-bound iron . A key subsidiary hypothesis iron administer meal amount use food fortification ( ~0.1 mg Fe/kg ) produce plasma non-transferrin-bound iron . This research carry Hospital Tropical Diseases , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand . The study intend help understand give iron folic acid preschool child Pemba , Zanzibar , Tanzania , ( `` Pemba trial '' ) dose recommended World Health Organization , could result increase hospitalization death . The investigator examine likely explanation , dose iron supplement use Pemba trial produce iron blood bound usual carrier iron ( protein call `` transferrin '' ) , call `` non-transferrin-bound iron '' , abbreviate NTBI . In child malaria , NTBI might favor growth malarial parasites cause infection . At present , study carry see NTBI present give iron patient malaria . Using non-radioactive form iron ( call `` stable isotope '' ) , investigator study iron absorption NTBI give single dose iron ( like use Pemba trial ) one day treatment malaria start , patient still malaria parasite blood , two week later , malaria cure . The investigator study adult admit Hospital Tropical Diseases Bangkok , Thailand , malaria . For reason safety , investigator choose study adult hospital rather child live area like Pemba result also apply child . The outcome research help u design way safely give iron malarious area adult child prevent treat iron deficiency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research determine effect acute infection Plasmodium falciparum absorption , pharmacokinetics metabolism iron iron supplement iron preparation non-immune adult Thailand . Our project combine measurement iron absorption successful treatment acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria characterization pharmacokinetics appearance plasma nontransferrin-bound iron ( NTBI ) measurements iron regulatory hormone , hepcidin , proteins iron metabolism . We examine iron supplement like use Pemba supplementation trial ( Sazawal et al. , Lancet 2006 ; 367 , 133-143 ) well alternative iron intervention could minimize avoid formation plasma non-transferrin-bound iron . This research three specific aim : 1. characterize pharmacokinetics appearance non-transferrin bound iron systemic circulation oral administration iron supplement iron intervention ; 2. determine effect acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria absorption iron iron supplement iron intervention , use erythrocyte incorporation stable isotope iron ; 3. ass effect acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria iron metabolism repeat measurement serum hepcidin , transferrin receptor , ferritin , haptoglobin , concentration pro- ( Th-1 ) anti- ( Th-2 ) inflammatory cytokine , erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin , complete blood count absolute reticulocyte count reticulocyte hemoglobin content ( CHr ) . These study effect infection P. falciparum iron absorption metabolism basic understanding interaction iron supplement malaria infection . The result could help guide choice optimal mean prevention treatment iron deficiency region endemic malaria . Characterization pharmacokinetics change plasma iron produce administration conventional iron supplement could lead design development new formulation supplemental iron would maximize iron absorption minimize risk associate non-transferrin-bound plasma iron . Because public health importance assure iron sufficiency mother , study focus woman childbearing age result broadly applicable optimal mean provide iron infant child .</detailed_description>
