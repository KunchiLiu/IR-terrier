	<brief_summary>Today 's medical imaging method insufficient specificity reliable differentiation benign malignant breast lesion patient . Pathologic evaluation currently way obtain definitive diagnosis . This research use novel method magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , Sweep Imaging Fourier Transform ( SWIFT ) , high magnetic field ( 4 Tesla ) distinguish malignant benign breast lesion . This research reveal whether SWIFT sequence bear new capability medical image breast cancer diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improved Breast MRI With SWIFT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ask come Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) University Minnesota . Researchers interview patient describe procedure risk . An intravenous ( IV ) line place upper extremity infuse magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contrast dye . Baseline MRI scan do . These MRI measurement compare clinical , radiological pathological finding ( gold standard ) . Follow-up contact occur within one year MRI determine whether pathology report available .</detailed_description>
