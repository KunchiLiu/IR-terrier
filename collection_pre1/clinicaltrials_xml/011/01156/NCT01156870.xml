	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SAR566658 Secondary Objectives : - To characterize safety profile SAR566658 - To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile SAR566658 - To assess potential immunogenicity SAR566658 - To assess preliminary antitumor activity - To assess effect SAR566658 recommend dose CYP3A enzyme activity use midazolam - To assess safety alternative schedule SAR566658 administration</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First Man Study SAR566658 Administered Patients With CA6-Positive Refractory Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration study one patient dose escalation phase study include screen period 3 week , 3-week treatment cycle ( ) 2-week treatment cycle ( ) . The patient may continue treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , willingness stop , follow minimum 30-day follow-up . If patient treat dose escalation part expansion cohort , continue benefit treatment time Clinical Study Report , patient continue study treatment continue undergo assessment per study flowchart . Such patient follow least 30 day last IMP administration .</detailed_description>
