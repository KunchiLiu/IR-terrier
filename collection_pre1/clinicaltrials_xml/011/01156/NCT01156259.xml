	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether 30Gy Involved-field Radiotherapy ( IFRT ) effective 40Gy treatment localize Diffused Large B cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) complete CR chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>30Gy Versus 40Gy Involved-field Radiotherapy Localized Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma Achieving CR After Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The best proper dos IFRT combine modality treatment ( CMT ) localize DLBCL still undetermined . Existing treatment guideline recommend 40Gy standard treatment dosage . However , large-scaled clinical trial imply small dos 30Gy may equivalent effective . Lowering radiation dos decrease treatment toxicity radiotherapy-induced disease , conform HD13 study Hodgkin 's Lymphoma . It may even retain truth modern era radiation technique involve especially patient achieve CR chemotherapy . A comprehensive , prospective dose-comparing study need .</detailed_description>
