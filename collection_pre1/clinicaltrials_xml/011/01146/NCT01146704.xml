	<detailed_description>Obesity major cause morbidity mortality within VA medical system account majority case diabetes mellitus , hypertension , coronary artery disease cerebrovascular accident . An improved understanding regulation body weight Veteran obese patient improve quality life avoidance serious medical complication suggest novel therapeutic approach . The large proportion Veteran population frequent VA health care system suffer obesity obesity-related illness benefit research . Obesity associate early mortality United States . It estimate result 280,000 death per year U.S. adult expense related obesity excess $ 80 billion . Obesity major cause morbidity mortality within VA medical system account majority case diabetes mellitus , hypertension , coronary artery disease cerebrovascular accident . The proposed study address important physiological question regard mechanism gut peptide regulate satiety food intake , well provide potentially important clinical treatment strategy . The release GI hormone response meal stimulus play important role regulation body weight homeostasis . The neural pathway interconnect gut signal satiety brain response nutrient intake regulate neuropeptides GI hormone . The investigator long history study GI hormone . In current application , investigator plan elucidate impact high protein diet profile gut hormone release postprandially obese subject underlying change neuronal ( vagal afferent ) level take place response high protein diet relevant experimental model . Understanding regulatory mechanism involve satiety provide clue exist novel form therapy . Studies may also provide insight underlie mechanism responsible weight loss induce gastroplasty bariatric procedure use treatment obesity . The study design three-group randomized , control study . This randomize controlled study last 24-30 month assign approximately 198 volunteer subject ( age 30 , BMI 27-40 kg/m2 ) ( 66 subject ) follow three group adhere diet number calorie : 1 . Very high protein diet group base 1.4 gram protein per pound lean body mass , 2 . High protein diet group base 1 gram protein per pound lean body mass , 3 . Standard protein diet group control base 0.5 gram protein per pound lean body mass calorie . All participant meet Registered Dietitian ( anticipate join research study team ) , assist diet effort arm . In study , percent energy fat hold constant 30 % difference diet relate protein carbohydrate content ( 35 % protein 35 % carbohydrate , 25 % protein 45 % carbohydrate , 12.5 % protein 57.5 % carbohydrate respectively ) . We assess efficacy high protein diet satiety pattern postprandial gut hormone obese patient . All subject follow dietitian determination circulate gut hormone biochemical assay perform .</detailed_description>
