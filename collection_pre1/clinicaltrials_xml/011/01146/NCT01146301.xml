	<brief_summary>As coronary artery stenting , activation embolisation platelet occur carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) . Based promise data use clopidogrel plus aspirin coronary stenting dual antiplatelet regimen introduce adjunctive treatment CAS . There yet , however , randomize control trial compare different loading dos clopidogrel CAS . Taking account wide interindividual variability response load clopidogrel exists , study intend establish optimal load dose clopidogrel . Therefore platelet function test 1-hour postprocedural TCD ( transcranial doppler ) monitoring perform . Objective : Firstly , investigate whether absolute magnitude Platelet Inhibition inversely correlate number TCD-detected microemboli CAS patient pre-treated either 300 mg 600 mg load dose clopidogrel . Secondly , impact early neurological outcome determine load dose clopidogrel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Carotid angioplasty stent placement ( CAS ) become well-accepted treatment option carotid artery stenosis . In combination experience CAS procedures introduction protection device low-profile system , periprocedural risk thromboembolic complication comparable standard surgical carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) In centre , patient severe asymptomatic carotid artery disease ( luminal diameter reduction 80 % , accord NASCET criterion ) schedule cardiac surgery eligible CAS . As coronary artery stenting , activation embolisation platelet occur CAS . Based promise data use clopidogrel plus aspirin coronary stenting , dual antiplatelet regimen introduce CAS . Specifically , antiplatelet regimen aspirin ( 300mg ) 300 mg load dose clopidogrel least 24 hour carotid angioplasty currently treatment choice carotid angioplasty stent placement . However , several study report wide interindividual variability response 300 mg load clopidogrel subsequent substantial proportion patient receive optimal benefit . Therefore , suggest 600 mg load dose result faster onset , high responsiveness high magnitude platelet inhibition without increase bleeding complication . For reason , interventional cardiology already adopt 600 mg load dose regimen standard care percutaneous coronary intervention . There yet , however , randomize control trial compare different loading dos clopidogrel CAS . Using transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) monitoring middle cerebral artery CAS , possible register number TCD-detected microembolic signal CAS . This monitoring enable operator diminish risk stroke CAS . However , significant number patient develop ischemic stroke hour follow CAS symptom-free interval As publish van der Schaaf et al. , TCD monitoring CEA , one hour monitoring appear effective select patient number microemboli spontaneously decrease . More important , postoperative TCD monitoring able detect patient risk new adverse cerebral event operation . Other study demonstrate potential application ultrasonic emboli detection examine efficacy new platelet agent relatively small number patient . It remain establish whether high magnitude platelet inhibition CAS additional protective effect decrease microembolic load measure TCD procedure . Moreover , TCD-monitoring post-CAS perform systematically past thus could reveal valuable information helpful understand post procedural cerebral complication risk stratification .</detailed_description>
