	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize switch regimen base efavirenz effective safe remain regimen base Lopinavir/ritonavir HIV-infected child . The investigator propose unblinded randomized clinical trial evaluate simplification , protease-inhibitor ( PI ) -sparing treatment strategy among nevirapine ( NVP ) -exposed HIV-infected child treat initially lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) . HIV-infected child age 3-5 year , history exposure NVP part prevention mother-to-child HIV transmission ( PMTCT ) , initiate LPV/r-based therapy first 36 month life enrol control arm Neverest 2 virally suppressed viral load &lt; 50 copies/ml include . These child randomize either substitute efavirenz ( EFV ) LPV/r continue LPV/r-based regimen . Eight week prior primary randomization , eligible child also randomize either remain stavudine ( D4T ) switch abacavir ( ABC ) . Children follow regular viral load clinical test 48 week primary randomization . Children experimental arm breakthrough viremia ( -defined two subsequent viral load &gt; 1000 copies/ml ) EFV-based regimen reinitiate LPV/r regimen . The primary objective test whether durability viral suppression equivalent child switch EFV-based therapy . The primary study endpoint failure HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml and/or confirm viremia &gt; 1000 copies/ml . Secondary aim include comparison immune preservation , toxicity , selection resistance mutation , adherence across two arm . Antiretroviral drug concentration adherence investigate possible explanation success and/or failure simplification regimen . The overall goal study contribute evidence base allow expansion treatment option HIV-infected child low resource setting .</brief_summary>
