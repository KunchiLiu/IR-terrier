	<brief_summary>Two third non small cell lung cancer patient present locally advanced tumour ( stage III ) metastatic disease ( stage IV ) radiotherapy play major role treatment . Treatment ( radiotherapy chemotherapy ) give curative intent select patient locally advance , stage III disease . Patients stage III tumour associate pleural effusion , patient present advanced , metastatic disease ( stage IV ) treat palliatively prospect cure . In latter , radiotherapy ( RT ) offer aim improving symptom , achieve tumour control optimise quality life . It generally believe plateau reach combination chemotherapy radiotherapy lung cancer . There strong rationale combine molecular targeted agent irradiation . AZD6244 potent , selective , uncompetitive inhibitor MEK test early phase clinical trial either alone combination chemotherapy variety cancer include lung cancer . Preclinical study show AZD6244 enhances effect radiation . AZD6244 yet combine radiotherapy clinical trial . In study , maximum 18 patient allocate one 3 dos AZD6244 combination standard dose RT Phase 1 dose escalation/ de-escalation design determine recommend dose Phase 2 trial ( RP2D ) . An expanded cohort 15 patient treated RP2D obtain additional safety preliminary response data . Patients undergo 3 FLT positron emission tomogram ( PET ) scan , first scan treatment , second scan AZD6244 treatment third scan RT . All patient also tissue/blood sample collect biomarkers . Biomarkers FLTPET image examine obtain information may predict response , resistance toxicity radiation AZD6244 .</brief_summary>
