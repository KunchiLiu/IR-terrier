	<brief_summary>The trial randomize , control trial . Adult patient undergo orthopaedic surgical procedure would randomize one two group surgical wound closure , skin suture skin staple . The primary outcome measure would surgical site infection indicate use oral intravenous antibiotic suspect wound infection and/or re-operation site . Patients would follow per usual post-operative course total three month trauma spine population six month total joint arthroplasty population . It hypothesize wound close suture staple similar infection rate define use antibiotic reoperation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sutures Versus Staples Wound Closure Orthopaedic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , clear consensus method best closure surgical wound orthopaedic surgery . Orthopaedic surgeon multitude wound closure habit . A recent meta-analysis comparing staple suture wound closure demonstrate three-fold increase infection staple wound compare sutured wound . The study use meta-analysis primarily poor methodological quality . A large , well-designed randomized , control trial need guide orthopedic surgeon choice wound closure material . This study would attempt provide information use suture versus skin staple effect development surgical site infection adult undergo orthopaedic procedure . A parallel group randomize control trial institutional review board approval conduct . Patients randomize intraoperatively skin wound close suture staple . Dressings use maintain blinding participant outcome assessor . The primary outcome measure infection adjudicate blind data safety monitoring committee . Suspected infection define : Use antibiotic reoperation infection operative site within three month ( six month arthroplasty subgroup ) The independent review , board blind treatment assignment , adjudicate suspect infection base clinical data . A cost analysis also perform compare cost associate wound close suture staple health care institution perspective . All data analyze blinded epidemiologist . Dichotomous primary secondary outcome measure analyze use Chi-squared statistic . Continuous outcome measure analyze use Student 's t-test . Subgroup analysis compare infection rate use suture versus staple anatomic area ( upper extremity , pelvis/acetabulum , hip/femur , knee , ankle ) . A subgroup analysis conduct compare trauma patient elective patient . Non-infected revision surgery also compare primary surgery . It hypothesize wound close suture staple similar infection rate define use antibiotic reoperation .</detailed_description>
