	<brief_summary>Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) important , troubled , part modern health care system . While seem likely technical structural element ICU care important determinant relevant ICU outcome , little known structure ICU care affect outcomes . One element potential importance way ICU physician ( intensivists ) organize provide ICU care , particularly night . The dominant , historical ( `` standard '' ) model intensivist staff involves intensivist present daytime hour , take `` call '' night home . But , recent year widespread concern whether patient experience adverse event bad outcomes relate less level expertise care readily available night hospital . Only two study , single ICUs , use simple vs. study design , conduct interventional study directly compare `` standard '' intensivist staff model `` 24-7 '' model nighttime intensivist coverage via shift work , i.e . daytime intensivist give way late afternoon nightshift intensivist remain hospital covered ICU morning . Those two study find contradictory effect intervention . But despite absence clear data indicate benefit ICU patient associated intensivists remain hospital overnight , major movement around world towards ICU staff model utilize shift work ensure coverage . The potential impact change staff paradigm large , possible effect major stakeholder involve ICU care : family , nurse , house officer . Both benefit detriment possible . On one hand , move shift work model model single intensivist becomes overwork sleep-deprived result responsible care day night , potential reduce sleep deprivation , job distress , burnout prevalent among intensivists standard staff model . But , would also require intensivists , serious challenge give worsen intensivist manpower shortage . Also , many detrimental effect shift work human , include negative effect motor function , cognition , sleep , job satisfaction , mood , error , cardiovascular health . Shift work common reason Emergency Medicine physician give leave field . The physical availability intensivist around-the-clock might also influence problem mention family dissatisfaction communication ICUs , poor communication/ teamwork physician often perceive ICU nurse . In ICUs teach hospital , relatively inexperienced house officer typically remain ICU overnight , nighttime presence attend physician might influence resident ' perception domain teach , clinical autonomy . This purpose study rigorously compare effect two different intensivist staffing model , specifically current standard model , 24-7 staff model enable via shift work . This study conduct two ICUs , one academic house officer remain ICU overnight ( Medical ICU Health Sciences Center ) , one community hospital currently lack overnight , in-ICU physician ( Victoria General Hospital ) . This study design improve upon prior study . To obviate problem use historical control inherent before-vs-after study design , study alternate two staffing model ( e.g . A-B-A-B ) . Also , investigator rigorously assess effect 24 hour intensivist presence major stakeholder , i.e . patient , family , intensivists , nurse , house officer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Around Clock Intensivist Coverage Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design &amp; Procedures - General Procedures The investigator directly compare 2 distinct model intensivist coverage 2 participate ICUs Winnipeg : A ) The standard model : A single intensivist staff ICU 7 day . He/she present daytime hour , take call home afterwards . This current staffing paradigm participate ICUs . B ) The 24-7 in-house coverage model : 24-7 in-hospital coverage intensivist enable split 24 hour period two shift . There , standard model , single intensivist cover ICU day shift one week . The day shift run 8 5:30 pm weekday , 8 3 pm Saturday Sunday . The night shift intensivist arrive take 5:30 pm weekday , 3 pm weekend remain hospital 8 . Call room provide allow night shift intensivist sleep , workload permit . The interventional part study last 32 week , comprise 4 block 8 week . It run October 2008 June 2009 . During 8 week block , ICU staff model A B . Thus alternate model : A-B-A-B one ICU , B-A-B-A . This alternate design obviate problem historical control ; nonrandom difference two staffing model see come go design . A variety outcomes compare two intensivist staff model . The primary outcome , one sample size analysis perform , intensivists ' burnout score . In order avoid contamination staff model , patient ( family participant ) whose ICU stay long enough include time model exclude analysis . Also exclude patient directly transfer one ICU Winnipeg another . For patient admit participate ICU study , initial ICU admission include analysis . The intensivists rotate weekly basis , provide questionnaire end week ICU service . ICU nurse survey end 8 week block give staff model . House officer ICU HSC rotate 4 week basis , provide questionnaire end final week ICU rotation . Even though study design make likely ( apart possibility seasonal difference 32 week study ) participant ' characteristic balance two staffing model , randomize study primary analysis use regression model adjust baseline characteristic subject . The investigator use ordinary least square quantile regression continuous variable , logistic regression binary variable . This approach permit assessment differential effect two site include : ( ) indicator variable represent separate site , ( ii ) interaction term indicator variable covariates . A relevant aspect analysis outcomes intensivists , nurse house officer derive questionnaire , single individual could complete questionnaire . Regression use General Estimating Equation methodology therefore use account correlation response within subject . Design &amp; Procedures - Specific Aims Specific Aim # 1 : To compare clinical outcome ICU patient care two intensivist staff model . • The Department Medicine long maintain comprehensive clinical database patient admit Winnipeg ICUs . It contain information patient ' demographic , illness type severity , comorbid condition , ICU hospital course , include outcome study . The investigator obtain deidentified data file contain information patient admit participate ICUs study period . Specific Aim # 2 : To compare family satisfaction ICU care two intensivist staff model . • On day participate ICUs , investigator attempt recruit next-of-kin one newly admit patient . The investigator use 2 stage consent process participant . The investigator use Family Satisfaction Survey - ICU 24 assess family satisfaction care . This well-validated tool two subscales , extensively used Canadian ICUs . Specific Aim # 3 : To compare work-related personal/emotional burden intensivists work two intensivist staff model . • The intensivists ask complete multiple questionnaire . Before start , conclude intervention , Winnipeg intensivists survey . After one week rotation , intensivists work week participate ICUs survey . A single consent provide begin study intervention ask intensivists consent questionnaire receive . The initial survey establish background information , ask opinion preference relate two different intensivist staffing model . The conclude survey repeat question . The weekly questionnaire contain item 5 scale analyze ; four scale validate . The fifth scale , Role Conflict , aim assess interaction occur shift work staff model , i.e . interface 2 intensivists shift-work . The investigator unable find scale address sort issue , thus create item . Specific Aim # 4 : To compare ICU nurse ' perception work alongside two intensivist staff model . • At end 8 week block study , ask nurse participate ICUs complete questionnaire . The questionnaire ask background information , mix shift work prior 8 week , include item 5 validate scale . Specific Aim # 5 : To compare ICU house officer ' perception work two intensivist staff model . • At end 4 week rotation ICU house officer Medical ICU HSC , ask complete questionnaire . The questionnaire ask background information , number previous ICU rotation complete , item 4 scale . The Autonomy Role Conflict scale validate . The Clinical comfort Education/learning scale previously use , formally validate .</detailed_description>
