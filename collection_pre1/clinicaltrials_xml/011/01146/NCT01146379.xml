	<brief_title>Does More Practice Improve Arm Movement After Stroke ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dose emerge key factor promote functional recovery stroke . Currently , lack data dose-response relationship impede progress field stroke rehabilitation . The goal propose project define range dose movement practice produce great improvement outcomes people chronic stroke . Borrowing animal model stroke , dose human quantify number repetition task-specific practice . Our central hypothesis exist range dos people stroke , , minimal benefit , , practice result benefit . The range beneficial dos likely vary base severity motor deficit presence non-motor deficit domain . Using randomize , parallel dose-response design , evaluate benefit four different dos task-specific upper extremity training match schedule 1 hr session , 4 sessions/wk 8 wks , 100 people chronic stroke . Total repetition dos evaluate ( 3200 , 6400 , 9600 , &amp; individualized-maximum ) base preliminary data . The individualized-maximum group may extend session beyond 8 wks meeting define stop criterion . Our primary aim test whether large total dos result good outcome small total dos . Benefits four dos evaluate impairment , activity , participation level , since understand dose-response relationship level measurement critical advance rehabilitation research . We hypothesize improvement great 9600 individualized-maximum , followed 6400 , 3200 repetition dose group . Our secondary aim characterize dose-response relationship upper extremity task-specific practice . With data multiple assessment point , individual curve model use estimate dose range , , minimal benefit , , practice result benefit . Furthermore , determine various factor modify dose estimate . We hypothesize severity motor deficit primary modifier dose-response relationship , large dos need mild motor deficit . We expect need dos large depression hemispatial neglect . Our team well-positioned investigate critical issue dose expertise stroke rehabilitation research measurement , understand challenge clinical practice clinical research , ready access patient population . Expected outcomes project empirically-driven estimate indicate amount movement practice require drive maximal improvement estimate individually modify people undergo stroke rehabilitation . Our estimate immediately impact rehabilitation research clinical practice . The importance project transcend stroke rehabilitation ; primary result high value many rehabilitation population also impede lack knowledge regard dose-response relationship .</detailed_description>
