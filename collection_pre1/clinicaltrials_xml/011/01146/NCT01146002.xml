	<brief_title>Language-based Learning Skills Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) : Impact Treatment With Sustained-release Guanfacine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LANGUAGE-BASED LEARNING SKILLS AND ADHD : IMPACT OF TREATMENT WITH SUSTAINED-RELEASE GUANFACINE Background : Children attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) often poorly school ( 1,2,3 ) . Their slow academic progress typically attributable inattention , restlessness , disorganization distractibility , diminish ability learn . Additionally , manifestation ADHD may worsen underlie specific learn disability ( SLD ) , common comorbidity ADHD ( 1,4,5 ) . Treatment ADHD often initiate goal enhance learn foster academic success . Yet change academic achievement result pharmacological treatment ADHD less evaluated clinical research change specifically define behavior . Such behavior typically include lack attention task , fidget , call , disorganization hyperactivity . These behavior , rather overall academic improvement , also measure typical ADHD rating scale ( 6 ) . A relatively small number clinical study assess impact medication treatment ADHD academic progress childhood adolescence . Some study ( 3,7 ) focus long-term measure , lack grade retention ultimate graduation high school . Other research try directly measure effect medication ADHD ability perform particular academic task . Typically , ability efficiently correctly solve series arithmetical problem - first , treatment , take stimulant medication , measure ( 8,9 ) . These study demonstrate methylphenidate-based amphetamine-based stimulant drug enable great speed , efficiency accuracy . Studying arithmetical speed accuracy determine medication 's helpfulness school setting may insufficient , however , since mathematics relevant academic material skill child require learn . To investigator 's knowledge prior study evaluate impact medication ADHD language-based task read read comprehension . Yet competency reading , read comprehension , auditory comprehension write arguably important competency arithmetic grammar school , becomes even essential middle school high school . Moreover , even apparently `` arithmetical '' subject mathematics science , word problem often utilized , arithmetical ability alone insufficient . Finally , also note common form SLD language-based disability manifest weakness reading , comprehension , write skill , arithmetical skill ( 10 ) . For reason , assume test arithmetical performance adequate demonstrate effectiveness medication ADHD , whether coexist SLD present . Study Protocol This single-arm study language-based academic skill child diagnose ADHD assess prior , treatment sustained-release guanfacine ( GXR ) . Children diagnose ADHD use standard rating instrument ( see ) . Children meet inclusion exclusion criterion undergo test language-based academic skill Woodcock-Johnson III test prior initiate treatment GXR . The daily dose GXR initiate 1 mg titrate 1 mg weekly interval , base significant improvement ADHD rating scale , maximum dose 4 mg. Once significant improvement ADHD manifestation record use rating scale , upward titration stop dose maintain . After five week repeat test use WJIII do . Results pre- post-medication testing compare group use appropriate statistical method . Study Population : We attempt recruit 20 child ADHD set well-established suburban pediatric neurology office practice . Primary efficacy endpoint : Statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 level ) improvement Woodcock-Johnson test score treatment GXR compare pre-treatment . Inclusion exclusion criterion : Children age 6 12 year newly diagnose ADHD-inattentive type ADHD-combined type identify . The diagnosis ADHD establish use Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Related Disorder , version IV , Text Revision ( DSM-IV TR , 2000 ) criterion ADHD Rating Scale IV ( ADHD-RS ; DuPaul et al. , 1998 ) . Patients follow exclude : - Intelligence ( IQ ) 85 determine formal testing ( see ) . - Identified suspected genetic syndrome . - Autism pervasive developmental disorder . - Psychiatric disorder ADHD oppositional defiant disorder . - Heart , liver renal disease . - Cancer . - Epilepsy non-febrile seizure history . - Cardiac arrhythmia , bradycardia , syncope . - Any condition consider potentially exacerbate endanger treatment alpha-2 agonist drug . - Prior treatment medication ADHD exclusion criterion . Screening initiation study : Children age 6 12 year newly diagnose ADHD-inattentive type -combined type identify . The diagnosis ADHD make mean DSM-IV -TR criterion ADHD-RS . Appropriate inform consent participate study obtain child 's parent ( ) . Patients screen medical condition exclude study . Vital sign check ; patient value 2nd 98th percentile also exclude . A comprehensive physical examination perform . Intelligence test use Wechsler Intelligence Scale Children , 4th ed . ( WISC ; Wechsler , 2003 ) perform . Children full-scale IQ 85 exclude . There one-week period serve washout currently take medication ADHD . Treatment medication test learn parameter : Children qualify study administer select portion Woodcock-Johnson Test III ( WJ-III ; Woodcock et al. , 2006 ) . We utilize section test evaluate phonetics , read fluency , read comprehension listen comprehension . Writing ability assess confound influence fine motor development write speed . Mathematical ability also test . This test include `` A '' `` B '' form . Only A form use initially minimize practice effect test later repeat . Treatment GXR initiate immediately test , titrate 5-week period . The initial dosage 1 mg daily titrate weekly interval maximum dose 4 mg. Clinical improvement measure follow-up visit include ADHD-RS Clinical Global Impression- Improvement Scale ( Guy , 1976 ) . Once change CGI-I score &lt; 2 decrease ADHD-RS score 30 % great note , increase daily dosage . Patients return 5 weekly visit . Vital sign , cardiac auscultation , routine follow-up physical examination perform visit . Patients experience adverse effect judge investigator clinically significant , well non-serious bothersome adverse effect respond dose adjustment take SRG . Events judge serious report IRB , FDA , Shire . After 5 visit , subject assess significant improvement ADHD-RS CGI-I take WJ-III `` B '' form ( see ) begin 2 hour take current dose . Data analysis : The subject ' score WJ-III , obtain initially treatment GXR , compare use one-tailed t-test . Continuation : Patients benefit study drug give option continue medication , prescribed physician , supply commercially . If elect continue , study drug taper 1 mg ( daily dosage ) per week .</detailed_description>
