	<brief_summary>The term 'hypersomnia ' describes group symptom include severe daytime sleepiness sleep long period time ( 10 hour per night ) . Sometimes , hypersomnia cause problem quality sleep occur night , instance nighttime sleep disrupt frequent breathing pause . In case , however , hypersomnia occurs even nighttime sleep good quality . These case hypersomnia presumed symptom brain dysfunction , refer hypersomnias central ( i.e. , brain ) origin . The cause central hypersomnia know . However , group recently identify problem major brain chemical responsible sedation , know GABA . In subset hypersomnia patient , naturally-occurring substance cause GABA receptor hyperactive . In essence , though patient chronically medicate Valium ( Xanax alcohol , substance act GABA system ) , even though take medication . Current treatment central hypersomnia limit . For fraction case narcolepsy , FDA-approved , available treatment . However , remainder patient , treatment approve FDA . They usually treat medication approve narcolepsy , sleep expert agree medication often effective group patient . Based understanding GABA abnormality patient , evaluate whether clarithromycin ( antibiotic approve FDA treatment infection ) would reverse GABA abnormality . In test tube model disease , clarithromycin fact return function GABA system normal . The investigator treat patient clarithromycin felt hypersomnia symptom improve treatment . To determine whether clarithromycin truly beneficial central hypersomnia , study compare clarithromycin inactive pill ( placebo ) . All subject receive clarithromycin placebo different time , reaction time symptom compare two treatment determine one superior . If study show clarithromycin effective placebo treatment hypersomnia , identify potential new therapy difficult-to-treat disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central hypersomnia characterize severe excessive daytime sleepiness despite long sleep period ( &gt; 10 hours/night ) absence nocturnal sleep pathology . They preferentially affect young adult , may result loss employment , lead motor vehicle accident ( 1 ) . Despite health , safety , quality life consequence , FDA-approved therapies several form central hypersomnia , include idiopathic hypersomnia ( IH ) . Currently , IH treat use therapy approve narcolepsy , despite lack clinical trial data consensus treatment response poor ( 2 ) . Treatments include traditional psychostimulants ( e.g. , amphetamine derivative ) well wake-promoting agent unknown mechanisms action modafinil sodium oxybate . In addition side effect include high abuse potential , tachycardia , alter mental status , treatment often ineffective substantial residual sleepiness frequently persist despite poly-therapy . The investigator hypothesize pathology GABA neurotransmitter system , brain 's major inhibitory system , underlies central hypersomnia . Currently , hypersomnia therapy GABA-antagonists . However , macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin show GABA-modulating property , result development insomnia mania subset patient . Clarithromycin therefore potentially viable , promising therapeutic agent hypersomnia relate positive modulation GABAA receptor . Open-label use clarithromycin six hypersomnia patient know ( n = 4 ) suspect ( n = 2 ) excess GABAA potentiation result marked improvement vigilance , measure psychomotor vigilance task ( PVT ) ( unpublished data ) . The investigator therefore propose pilot , crossover trial compare clarithromycin placebo treatment hypersomnia patient excess GABAA potentiation . The primary endpoint decrease PVT reaction time . Secondary endpoint include decrease PVT lapse change Epworth , Stanford , FOSQ sleep scale . Successful result trial would provide early evidence rational efficacious treatment hypersomnia could avoid potential abuse , toxicity , treatment failure associate traditional treatment . This pilot crossover trial clarithromycin placebo treat central hypersomnia . Subjects untreated hypersomnia experience persistent symptom despite traditional therapy eligible . Subjects medication hypersomnia begin study ask maintain stable dos medication one month throughout study period . Twenty subject assess baseline one two week study drug ( clarithromycin 500 mg bid match placebo bid ) . After two week study drug , undergo one week washout period , change study drug additional two week . Patients randomized order presentation study drug ten subject randomize group . Random sequence generation perform pharmacy . All study investigator subject remain blinded group assignment .</detailed_description>
