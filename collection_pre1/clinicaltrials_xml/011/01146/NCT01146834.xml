	<brief_summary>This phase III randomize trial compare three different peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens patient multiple myeloma receive primary induction therapy therapy . Up 180 patient enrol . Patients eligible treatment randomize one three follow mobilization regimen : Arm A = VELCADE , CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE , G-CSF Arm B = VELCADE &amp; G-CSF Arm C = CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE &amp; G-CSF</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES • To compare efficacy follow peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens MM : . High dose cyclophosphamide , VELCADE , G-CSF ii . VELCADE G-CSF iii . High dose cyclophosphamide G-CSF SECONDARY STUDY OBJECTIVES • To evaluate biomarkers surrogate marker mobilization arm To evaluate change tumor mass define standard response parameter . To evaluate safety arm . This phase III randomize trial compare three different peripheral stem cell mobilization regimens patient multiple myeloma receive primary induction therapy Primary Endpoints ) Percentage patient able collect &gt; 6 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg &lt; 2 collection .
