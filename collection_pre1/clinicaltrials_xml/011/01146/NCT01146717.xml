	<brief_summary>This study do find whether regulation brain blood flow alter patent mild cognitive impairment ( memory problem otherwise healthy ) compare healthy elderly individual . In addition , study determine whether exercise training improve brain blood flow , brain structure , brain function patient mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . This research study present investigator know little brain blood flow regulation patient mild cognitive impairment . The investigator also know little whether exercise training improve brain blood flow , brain structure , brain function patient mild cognitive impairment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerobic Exercise Training Mild Cognitive Impairment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We plan study 70 patient amnestic MCI 30 healthy old adult similar age , sex , educational level research University Texas Southwestern ( UTSW ) Medical Center Dallas Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas - Institute Exercise Environmental Medicine ( IEEM ) . To help decide qualify study , researcher may ask question health , include medication take surgical procedure . You may also fill certain form follow exam , test procedure . The screen process usually take 2-3 hour . You require come 7-9 visit include initial screening eligibility participate study . The experiment measure brain perfusion , vascular function exercise capacity . For healthy control , expect length study 2-3 month include test visit . Your participation study end follow completion test . For Mild Cognitive Impairment , expect length study 18 month include test visit exercise training . Your participation study end follow completion repeat test one-year exercise training control intervention . On occasion , training may delay due injury , illness personal matter . If case , enrollment study may last long one year attempt complete training testing .</detailed_description>
