	<brief_title>The Optimal Dosage Intrathecal Morphine Peripartum Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Regional anesthesia technique combine spinal epidural ( CSE ) analgesia effective management intrapartum pain . The advantage technique safe properly conduct provide excellent analgesia allow patient remain awake participate labor delivery . The risk maternal aspiration fetal drug depression associate general anesthesia minimize . Finally , effective analgesia associate regional technique blunt hemodynamic effect cause painful contraction reduce maternal catecholamine , result increase placental perfusion.1 Opioids combination local anesthetic spinal space provide effective pain relief labor minimal side effect . The advantage spinal opioid administration include lack motor blockade faster onset analgesia.2 In addition , since opiate receptor spinal space , small amount opioid use provide excellent pain relief minimize side effect . At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) , obstetric anesthesiology group use standard spinal dosing CSE labor include : 1 ml 0.25 % bupivicaine 12.5 mcg fentanyl . Yeh colleague find morphine 150 mcg add fentanyl-bupivicaine spinal injection prolong duration spinal analgesia associate increased side effect . 3 The side effect profile spinal narcotic include : nausea , vomit , pruritus , urinary retention . Although side effect part easily treat , bothersome post partum patient . In previous study perform institution , addition 100 mcg morphine spinal bupivicaine fentanyl reduce rate breakthrough pain labor analgesia prolonged time first request supplementation . Overall , find incidence side effect low group receive spinal morphine nausea vomit compare placebo group . 4 In current investigation , would like ass whether even small dose spinal morphine would provide effective , pain free recovery vaginal delivery decrease incidence side effect , specifically nausea vomit . We would like perform formal dose response study identify ideal dose intrathecal morphine would compromise pain relief labor minimize side effect .</detailed_description>
