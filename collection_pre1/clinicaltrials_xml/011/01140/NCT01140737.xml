	<brief_summary>The study objective evaluate therapeutic activity , safety tolerability axitinib patient advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma unsuitable relapsed standard chemotherapy . The therapeutic activity separately assess angiosarcoma , synovial sarcoma , leiomyosarcomas sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Axitinib Patients With Advanced Angiosarcoma Other Soft Tissue Sarcomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue sarcomas heterogeneous group rare malignancy account 0.72 % new malignancy 0.65 % malignant death . Advanced sarcoma carry poor prognosis . Angiogenesis hallmark tumour growth , increase evidence antiangiogenic drug , include axitinib , lead tumour regression improve patient survival variety tumour . Patients angiosarcoma , synovial sarcoma , leiomyosarcoma sarcoma separately evaluate . Patients take axitinib 5mg tablet mouth twice daily . This continue 2 year disease progression , development limit toxicity . In event severe toxicity , axitinib stop toxicity improve . Treatment may interrupt maximum 2 week . Following , axitinib restart low dose 3 mg twice daily . If toxicity improve sufficiently , axitinib permanently stop . Patients monitor weekly first month , 4 week interval . Toxicity closely monitor . At clinic visit , patient physical examination routine blood test . A Chest x-ray , CT and/or MRI scan do study entry , every 12 week end treatment . Disease evaluation carry 12 week study entry , every 12 week disease progression . After disease progression , patient follow every 3 month survival . Patients follow death minimum follow period 1 year . Patients enrol hospital UK .</detailed_description>
