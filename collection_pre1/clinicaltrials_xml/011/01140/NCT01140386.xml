	<brief_summary>The issue study prevalence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) hospitalize pediatric patient , identify subgroup patient may high risk . There two hypothesis look study . The first hypothesis individual risk factor VTE hospitalize pediatric patient : age &gt; 14 , obesity , black race , female sex , presence central venous line ( CVL ) , traumatic mechanism injury , orthopaedic surgery , use oral contraceptive . The second hypothesis risk factor additive effect risk stratification develop identify patient high risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Risk Factors Venous Thromboembolism Hospitalized Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism well recognize concern hospitalize adult population : 11-15 % medically ill adult venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) 4-5 % develop proximal DVT absence prophylaxis.6 Furthermore , diagnose event underestimation prevalence VTE 80 % clinically silent.6 VTE risk stratification exist adult population prophylaxis VTE standard procedure . While VTE occur less frequently pediatric population , incidence rise . Vu et al report significant increase DVT 2003 compare 1997 use data Health Care Cost Utilization Project Kids ' Inpatient Database . 2 If one extrapolate know adult risk factor VTE child , rise could attribute increase childhood obesity ,4 increase estrogen-based therapy among teenage girls1 , increase pediatric trauma.3 However , study perform show identify adult risk factor indeed pediatric risk factor well . Due lack knowledge risk factor VTE pediatric population , minimal guideline physician provide prophylactic treatment even heighten awareness possibility VTE pediatric patient . Furthermore , scant publish guideline regard type prophylactic treatment safe efficacious pediatric population , guideline regard treatment establish VTE . Outcomes prophylactic treatment able evaluate accurately measure undertaken patient identify high risk . Identification high risk group subsequent prevention VTE important due significant morbidity mortality associate VTE . Vu et al report two-fold increase in-hospital death pediatric patient identify VTE compare without one . This risk independent comorbid conditions.2 Morbidity include pulmonary embolism , recurrent thrombosis , postphlebitic syndrome ( characterized swelling , pain , skin induration pigmentation cause incompetent venous valve ) . Due young age onset , pediatric patient morbidity live consequence much long period time ; furthermore , may experience secondary consequence limb length discrepancy , etc . Currently sharp delineation prophylaxis strategy define merely age . As soon patient 18 assess risk stratification model give prophylaxis meet criteria . A patient one year younger , however , leave unevaluated due lack criterion VTE risk pediatric patient . The patient may fit height weight average full grown adult , may possess many criterion use ass adult VTE risk . He still may offer prophylaxis treatment due age alone . This assume age best predictive factor VTE young patient . However , study do assess risk factor truly exist pediatric patient , , suggest factor play equation , may even important.5 Due potential complication VTE well prophylaxis , increase prevalence VTE pediatric population , study regard risk factor safety/efficacy prophylactic treatment need establish guideline care .</detailed_description>
