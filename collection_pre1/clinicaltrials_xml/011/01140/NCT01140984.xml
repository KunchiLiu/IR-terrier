	<brief_title>Intra Arterial ( IA ) Steroids Infusion Hepatic Acute Hepatic Graft Versus Host Disease ( aGVHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population include 30 patient SR AGVHD index B , C , D IBMTR severity index localize liver . Standard treatment SR AGVHD include : IV cyclosporine tacrolimus adjust dos depend serum level methylprednisolone prednisone 2 mg/kg/d . This treatment may continue study period although steroid taper attempt clinically possible . GVHD diagnosis base upon clinical criterion biopsy ( need ) involve organ . GVHD grade accord International Bone Marrow Transplantation Registry ( IBMTR ) severity index . Intra-arterial treatment give less 72h completion inclusion criterion . Partially respond non-responding patient may receive second treatment within 14 day initial intra-arterial treatment , discretion treat physician . Definitions Hepatic response : - Initial response - day bilirubin level begin decrease . - Partial response 75 - day bilirubin level decrease 75 % basal level . - Partial response 50 - day bilirubin level decrease 50 % basal level . - Partial response 25 - day bilirubin level decrease 25 % basal level . - Complete response - day bilirubin level decrease normal level .</detailed_description>
