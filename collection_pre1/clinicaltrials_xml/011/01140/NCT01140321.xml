	<detailed_description>Aim Study At present , due global therapeutic approach , prognosis Thalassemia Major Severe Thalassemia Intermedia open-ended . Regular transfusional regimen childhood early iron chelation therapy prevent bone deformity past characterized disease even though accord several author high percentage patient suffer osteopenia-osteoporosis . This persistent complication may explain one coexistent factor anaemia , genetic factor , sex hormone involve bone metabolism , iron chelation therapy , hypothiroidism , low subnormal concentration serum vitamin D , etc . Pain result parameter may consider distinguish patient Thalassemia Major healthy patient age survey Quality Life perform Center Genoa . More frequently pain localized lumbar vertebra , often describe invalidant picture refer osteoporosis vertebral body . The incidence spontaneous fracture observe specialistic center treat pathology increase . Thalassemia Intermedia eterogeneous clinical entity include wide range phenotype mild severe form . In mild form hemoglobin level range 8-9 g/dl , stable without need regular transfusion therapy unless intercurrent episode aggravate anemia ; expansion bone marrow observe . By contrast , form anemia persistently severe ( 6.5- 7.5 g/dl ) mark ineffective erythropoiesis . In case , especially diagnosis make childhood , patient receive transfusional regimen similar Major form similar complication osteoporosis . For reason patient affect Severe Thalassemia Intermedia Thalassemia Major prevention early diagnosis osteoporosis important well treatment establish disease order improve quality life life expectancy . In therapeutical trial previously describe bisphosphonates show effective ability inhibit bone resorption relatively side effect result increase bone density . Since previous trial conduct small number patient , propose randomize , open label large multicentric trial test efficacy Neridronate . The possibility administrate drug every 90 day intravenous make dose regimen simple reduces frequency administration . These important factor improve adherence therapy patient already subject heavy daily therapeutic load . Primary Objectives The primary objective study evaluate efficacy Neridronate ( aminobisphosfonate third generation prove several clinical trial ability inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption ) increase Bone Mass Density ( BMD ) measure Double X-ray densitometry ( DXA ) . Bone densitometry perform basal screen 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month begin treatment . Secondary objectives The effect Neridronate bone turn evaluate bone alcaline phosphatase ( BALP ) telopeptide C-terminal type 1 seric collagen ( CTX-s ) , screen 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month begin treatment . The dosage marker centralize . Study design An Italian Multicentric randomize , open-label therapeutic trial evaluate efficacy safety Neridronate treatment Osteoporosis patient Thalassemia Major Severe Thalassemia Intermedia . Efficacy safety drug evaluate measure every visit parameter : - haematological : Haemochrome - blood chemistry : creatinine , BUN , AST , ALT , Ca , P , proteins electrophoresis , total protein . The prevalence ectopic calcification pseudoxantoma elasticum ( PXE ) -like syndrome follow-up evaluate begin study vs 24 month physical examination , abdominal echography fundus oculi examination . During trial know risk factor osteoporosis record , include prevalence incidence bone fracture , execute , Polimorphisms COLIA1 At begin study month 12 24 morphometry DXA evaluation presence bone deformity Furthermore data regard QOL symptom pain evaluate trough administration scale SF-36 .

Phenotypical characterization MSCs prepare thalassemic patient treat without neridronate A . In vitro analysis effect iron overload chelating molecule MSCs growth osteogenic differentiation 1 . Preparation collection bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell normal subject To isolate prepare MSCs , utilize protocol describe detail Oliva et . al . ( Molec . Cell . Biochem. , 2003 , 247:55-60 ) . The detail MSCs preparation report annex . The cell express specific surface marker , CD13 , CD29 , CD44 , CD105 , CD166 , negative hematopoietic cell marker CD14 , CD34 CD45 . In way , prepare normal MSCs'bank , perform experimentation . At present , already available 10 preparation MSCs normal subject . 2 . Analysis effect iron overload proliferation differentiation MSCs Although well know thalassemic subject undergo iron overload , data available Literature effect metal proliferation differentiation MSCs . To aim proceed indicate . We evaluate proliferation rate iron ferritin intracellular level MSCs logarithmic phase incubate increase concentration iron , start physiological hematic amount , i.e . 2-18 microg/ml , reach value 10-fold high , similar occur thalassemic patient . We analyze effect growth rate direct cell count , MTT vitality assay , 3H-thymidine incorporation ( DNA synthesis ) . Successively analyze effect iron overload level main proteic product MSCs , namely type I collagen , follow protocol report . Confluent culture early passage ( 0-3 ) MSCs , nontreated treat iron overload , tripsinized , count centrifuge 800xg . The pellet resuspend 0.5 M acetic acid contain 250 microg/ml pepsin . After 16 hour gentle shake 4°C , insoluble residue pelleted 20.000xg 1 hour , solubilized run buffer analyzed 6 % SDS-PAGE . Afterwards , proteins blot nitrocellulose membrane incubate rabbit monoclonal antibody specific human type I collagen . The immunoreactive band incubated horse radish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody detect mean enhanced chemoluminescent technique ( ECL ) . The effect differentiation evaluate analyze expression specific marker osteoblastic phenotype , namely alkaline phosphatase activity osteocalcin production . In addition , evaluate osteogenic capacity MSCs express extracellular matrix mineralization . Confluent culture incubate osteogenic medium compose dexametasone 100 nM beta-glycerophosphate 10 mM . If osteogenic capacity present , calcification noduli appear within 2-4 week . To confirm matrix mineralization measure calcium level finally carry specific stain von Kossa method . 3 . Analysis effect iron chelate molecule proliferation differentiation MSCs We evaluate effect DFO , represent far use chelate molecule therapy thalassemia spite well know disadvantage toxicity . MSCs culture , nontreated treat iron overload , add DFO concentration similar obtain vivo follow drug administration thalassemic patient . We analyze effect treatment growth rate , collagen type I level , alkaline phosphatase activity , osteocalcin production , well osteogenic capacity . 4 . Characterization cell cycle component MSCs subject iron overload and/or DFO It well know characterization cell cycle component represent basis comprehension pivotal event proliferation differentiation process . Thus , cell extract obtain MSCs cell population treat described ( i.e . iron , DFO iron overload and/or desferrioxamine ) analyze immunoblotting employ antibody several cycle proteic component .
