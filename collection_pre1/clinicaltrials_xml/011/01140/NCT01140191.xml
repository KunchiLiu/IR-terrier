	<detailed_description>Subjects screen period 14 day prior first treatment , receive treatment daily 20 day . Safety assess monitor AEs , lesion site reaction , vital sign , hematology , blood chemistry parameter . Complete cure ulcerated lesion define 100 % re-epithelialization measurement ulceration 0 x 0 mm . non-ulcerated treated lesion also measure monitor total area exposure lesion study drug evaluate cure ( absence raise area skin ) . Follow-up evaluation 28 +2 day , 60 +7 day 100 +14 day .</detailed_description>
