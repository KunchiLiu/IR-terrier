The exchangeable zinc pool ( EZP ) define estimate total size combine pool zinc exchange zinc plasma within approximately 2-3 day may also differ SGA AGA infant . 1 . Compare longitudinal zinc intake measure milk zinc concentration volume intake breast milk SGA AGA infant first 12 mo . 2 . Compare post-natal growth rate SGA AGA infant first 12 mo life relation zinc intake . 3 . Compare size exchangeable zinc pool ( EZP ) birth 6 mo age SGA AGA infant . Hypotheses : 1 . Zinc concentration human milk significantly different stage lactation mother SGA infant mother AGA infant . 2 . The volume breast milk intake relative body weight similar SGA AGA infant , total intake lower SGA infant . 3 . Linear growth rate , rate weight gain , rate growth head circumference significantly low infant born SGA , positively correlated total daily zinc intake . 4 . The size EZP birth significantly small absolute size relative body weight infant bear SGA compare AGA</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Scientific Background : Large-scale zinc supplementation study demonstrate highly significant positive effect growth , morbidity mortality infant bear small gestational age ( SGA ) . This suggest infant may high postnatal requirement compare appropriate gestational age ( AGA ) infant , possibly due inadequate zinc intake breast milk due either low volume difference milk zinc concentration mother SGA compare AGA infant . Alternatively , SGA infant may lower zinc store birth , may reflect great postnatal requirement optimal zinc status . It thus possible zinc requirement SGA infant exceed zinc intake achieve exclusive breastfeeding , recommend first 6 mo life . Estimated rate infant born intrauterine growth retardation , include SGA , 25-40 % birth south Asia ( Bhutta - 2004a ) . Scientific Scope Project ( Scientific problem address overall specific objective ) : The overall objective project compare zinc intake human milk fluid complementary food SGA AGA infant first 12 mo life ; growth group also monitor . A secondary goal compare size exchangeable zinc pool SGA AGA infant birth 6 mo , period recommend exclusive breastfeeding . Specific Aims : 1 . Compare longitudinal zinc intake measure milk zinc concentration volume intake breast milk SGA AGA infant first 12 mo . 2 . Compare post-natal growth rate SGA AGA infant first 12 mo life relation zinc intake . 3 . Compare size exchangeable zinc pool ( EZP ) birth 6 mo age SGA AGA infant . Expected Outcomes : Expected outcome include longitudinal data SGA AGA infant first year life , include human milk intake , zinc concentration human milk , zinc intake human milk , estimate intake non-milk fluid complementary food , anthropometric measurement ( length , weight , head circumference ) , size exchangeable zinc pool ; cross-sectional data plasma zinc , ferritin hemoglobin 6 mo also obtain . These outcome compare SGA AGA infant . Relationships among variable also examine , include relationship zinc intake size EZP observe growth outcome .</detailed_description>
