	<brief_summary>While hypotension general anesthesia routinely consider tolerable abnormality little clinical consequence , propose study take innovative approach define hypotensive event within construct patient 's hypertensive status , fractional mean arterial blood pressure ( fMAP ) . Because investigator primary variable within control anesthesia personnel , study portends potentially simple easy implement treatment . The introduction neuropsychometric measure relevant evaluator post-operative cognitive dysfunction innovative , may relevant average elderly patient simple mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Dysfunction Hypertensive Patients Having Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After major non-cardiac non-cerebral surgery , postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) occur significant percentage patient . The consequence POCD profound . Elderly patient POCD 1 week increase risk disability voluntary early retirement , patient POCD 3 month increase mortality . The effect low arterial blood pressure , call hypotension , surgery incidence POCD obvious . This effect obscure number previous study , assume hypotension persist minute hour deleterious , , fact , duration uncertain . In addition , patient outcome analyzed function history hypertension . In research application , investigator focus specifically patient history hypertension physiology different patient normal arterial blood pressure . These hypertensive patient may unable compensate low arterial blood pressure process call cerebral autoregulation . As result , patient history hypertension may great risk decrease cerebral perfusion cerebral ischemia secondary decrease systemic arterial blood pressure even surgery procedure think put brain risk ischemia . In prior retrospective study , investigator analyze hemodynamic data fifty elderly ( average age &gt; 60 year ) patient simple lumbar spine surgery , think associate cerebral ischemia . These patient examine battery neuropsychometric test surgery . Patients history hypertension cognitive change dependent low fractional mean arterial blood pressure ( fMAP ) , fMAP mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) divide baseline MAP . Such change find patient without history hypertension . This relationship depend steady state fMAP high fMAP reach either group . To confirm extend result investigator therefore propose hypothesize : In patient history hypertension , compare patient without history , low fMAPs induction predict cognitive performance surgery . To evaluate hypothesis investigator determine incidence post-operative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) function fMAP hypertensive normotensive patient undergo elective simple lumbar spine surgery . If propose study demonstrate acute intra-operative episode hypotension deleterious cognitive performance patient hypertension , demonstrable consequence term QOL measure , possibility direct low cost intervention available lead directly efficacy trial use non-invasive measure cerebral blood flow algorithms prevent POCD . The investigator plan conduct multicenter study 200 elderly patient ( &gt; 60 year ) test validated battery 6 neuropsychometric test simple elective lumbar spine surgery ( microdiscectomy 1-2 level laminectomy without fusion last &lt; 5 hour require blood transfusion ) two time surgery , 24 hour 1 month . Two questionnaire QOL perform surgery 1 month . Patients question whether history hypertension , , , duration treatment . Our analysis base compare fMAP neuropsychometric performance surgery . To see neuropsychometric change occur component routine anesthetic , anesthesiologist give specific protocol intraoperative management . The primary outcome measure change test performance baseline post-operative period 1 day 1 month . This primary measure rating overall change performance compare three value fMAPs : low , steady state high fMAP attain . Our analysis also include uni- multi-variate analysis include QOL .</detailed_description>
