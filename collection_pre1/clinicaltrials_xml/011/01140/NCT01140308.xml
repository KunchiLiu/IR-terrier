	<brief_summary>Statins ( simvastatin Zocor ) effective widely prescribe medication low cholesterol level reduce frequency heart attack , cardiac death stroke . Unfortunately , statin cause muscle discomfort pain call `` myalgia '' patient treat drug . These symptom often cause patient need medication stop take drug . The cause statin muscle pain know , think reduction vitamin-like substance call Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) statin treatment may play role . CoQ10 vitamin like substance drug approve regulate Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This study look effect CoQ10 supplement individual develop muscle symptom simvastatin . The investigator hope test hypothesis CoQ10 supplementation compare placebo patient document statin myalgia reduces intensity pain statin treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview : We estimate , base calculation detail 80 subject document statin myalgia require test hypothesis . Consequently , 135 patient statin myopathic complaint recruit Cholesterol Management Center Hartford Hospital , newspaper radio advertisement contact physician ' office . Subjects withdraw lipid lower medication least 4 week . Subjects serum measure baseline lipid , liver , kidney , thyroid function , creatine kinase ( CK ) CoQ10 value randomize treatment simvastatin 20 mg daily match placebo 2 month . Subjects call weekly ass symptom . Blood measurement repeat treatment ( simvastatin placebo ) stop 2 month subject experience muscle symptom continuously one week . After 4 week , subject cross alternative placebo simvastatin treatment monitor measurement process repeat . Those patient develop myalgia statin treatment , placebo , enter CoQ10 study , 4 week treatment . These subject serum lipid , liver , CK , vitamin D CoQ10 level measure , 4mL blood sample store future white blood cell analysis undergo test muscle performance exercise capacity . They randomize placebo CoQ10 treatment arm , `` load '' placebo CoQ10 ensure adequate tissue level two week , retreat simvastatin 20 mg daily . Subjects call weekly inquire muscle symptom . Blood measurement repeat , another 4mL blood sample store future white blood cell analysis treatment ( simvastatin/CoQ10 simvastatin/placebo ) stop 2 month subject experience muscle symptom continuously one week . After 4 week subject cross alternative simvastatin/CoQ10 simvastatin/placebo treatment monitor measurement repeat . The primary endpoint intensity pain eight week , subject continuous symptom week ( less case intolerable symptom ) , whichever come first . We also determine time day onset repeat myopathic symptom measure muscle performance include skeletal muscle strength endurance maximal aerobic exercise capacity use technique use present NIH fund research project The Effect Statins Skeletal Muscle Function ( R01 HL081893 ) . We measure muscle strength , endurance aerobic capacity weakness frequent , largely unquantified , complaint among patient statin myalgia prevention CoQ10 therefore important . Also , investigator report change rest exercise respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) statin therapy imply alteration cellular substrate metabolism statin may influence CoQ10 treatment . Study Subjects : Subjects recruit Cholesterol Management Center , see approximately 20 new patient weekly , majority statin myalgia refer Dr. Thompson 's expertise topic , via advertisement physician contact mail email informing study . Subjects reimburse $ 500 participation study . Study Definition Statin-Related Myopathic Complaints : Statin myopathic symptom poorly define medical literature . For purpose study , subject consider prior statin related complaint recruit participation study follow occur : 1 . They develop new myalgia , cramp , muscle ache statin treatment ; 2 . The symptom resolve within 4 week stop statin . Subjects meet criterion recruit study . To ensure patient document statin myalgia enter CoQ10 trial , subject history statin myalgia treat 8 week simvastatin 20 mg daily placebo double-blind , cross-over protocol . Those develop statin myalgia simvastatin treatment advance CoQ10 trial . Throughout study , subject contact phone weekly inquire muscle complaint use Brief Pain Inventory ( Short Form ) ( BPI-SF ) ( 18 ) . Results record paper form enter database . During phone contact , subject symptoms statin myopathy CK level determine within 72 hour study drug . If CK &gt; 10 time upper limit normal ( UNL ) , standard diagnosis myositis , unassociated recent exercise , drug stop subject undergo prompt repeat test remove study . If CK &lt; 10 UNL , drug continue subject symptom 1 week document symptom transitory . After 1 week persistent symptom soon possible patient intolerable symptom , subject undergo final testing complete study . This reduce undue subject burden subject maintain statin treatment multiple week pain symptom . Subjects report recurrent symptom treat 8 week , time undergo final testing complete study . Justification Primary Endpoint : We examine ability CoQ10 reduce intensity pain many patient would remain statin therapy discomfort tolerable . Consequently , increase pain tolerability key clinical measure . We select 8 week therapy simvastatin v placebo CoQ10 v placebo section study large clinical study , median time onset myalgia statin na√Øve subject 1 month statin rechallenge typically reproduce symptom rapidly . Consequently , subject true statin myalgia clearly develop symptom 8 week , point study procedure complete , allow u accurately assess impact CoQ10 muscle pain intensity . Except chronic aspirin use , commonly recommend patient risk heart disease , patient chronically use pain medication even statin therapy , counter pain medication use myalgic myopathic symptom prohibit study . Study outline : 135 Subjects Prior Statin Complaints : Stop Cholesterol Drugs least 4 Weeks Run-In : Initial - Simvastatin Placebo 1 . Phlebotomy : Lipids1 , ALT , creatinine , TSH , CK , CKMB , Vitamin D CoQ10 2 . Arterial Stiffness 3 . FMD/Nitroglycerin administration 4 . Simvastatin 20 mg 8 week Until Symptoms Persist 1 Week Intolerable 5 . Obtain lipids CK **4-week washout follow crossover repeat 1 - 5** **4-Week Washout** **100 Subjects Symptomatic Statins Only ( CoQ10 treatment phase ) ** : 1 . Phlebotomy : Lipids , ALT , creatinine , CK , CKMB , Vitamin D CoQ10 , 4mL sample stored future white blood cell analysis 2 . Baseline Strength Exercise Performance Testing , Accelerometer , Pain Questionnaire 3 . Randomization Treatment : Placebo 600 mg CoQ10 4 . Load Subjects 2 week Treatment Simvastatin 20mg + Placebo ( N=50 ) Simvastatin 20mg + CoQ10 ( N=50 ) Weekly phone call : Pain Questionaires At 8 Weeks Until Symptoms Persist 1 Week Intolerable : 1 . Phlebotomy : Lipids , ALT , creatinine , CK , CKMB CoQ10 , Vitamin D , 4mL sample stored future white blood cell analysis 2 . Arterial stiffness 3 . Strength Exercise Performance Testing , Accelerometer , Pain Questionnaire **4 week washout follow crossover , repeat 1-4 1-3 above** Weekly phone call use assess muscle symptom document myalgia All visit include Cognitive Failures Questionnaire .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We exclude patient diagnose CAD , peripheral vascular disease diabetes since patient warrant aggressive lipid treatment , would benefit intervention increase tolerance statin . We consider inappropriate unethical place patient placebo simvastatin v placebo phase patient previously document intolerant statin . All patient maintain lipid lower diet study . LDL Cholesterol Levels LDL level criterion inclusion exclusion study since patient previously deem appropriate candidate statin therapy physician recent clinical trial result suggest statin use high risk individual regardless pretreatment LDLC value . Race We seek recruit Caucasians , Hispanics African American accordance distribution study community . CoQ10 Use Subjects previously use supplemental CoQ10 must discontinue supplementation two month prior enter study . Diet All subject instruct standard lipid lower diet ask maintain throughout 6 month study . Subjects exclude cancer within 5 year entry , hepatic disease ( ALT &gt; 2 time normal ) renal disease ( creatinine &gt; 2 mg/L ) since patient may require careful monitoring study would best manage totally clinical setting . Subjects presently treat medication know alter statin metabolism ( 3 ) Subjects discontinue lipidlowering medication Subjects hypo hyper thyroidism define TSH &gt; 5 &lt; 0.01 IU/L since condition know associated statin intolerance muscle weakness , respectively Subjects hepatic dysfunction evidence baseline alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level &gt; 2 UNL Subjects renal dysfunction define baseline creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl ; Subjects physical disability prohibit strength exercise performance measurement Subjects regularly use corticosteroid drug know affect skeletal muscle metabolism regularly intramuscular injection affect CK level . Women childbearing potential use effective birthcontrol technique .</criteria>
