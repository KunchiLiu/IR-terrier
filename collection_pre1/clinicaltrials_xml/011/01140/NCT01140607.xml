	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) safety Cabazitaxel administer advanced solid tumor patient vary degree hepatic impairment - To determine pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) Cabazitaxel patient vary degree hepatic impairment - To correlate PK variable pharmacodynamic ( PD ) safety parameter order guide prescribers regard dose patient population - To assess effect cabazitaxel recommend dose 25mg/m^2 CYP3A enzyme activity use midazolam probe additional cohort cancer patient normal hepatic function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetic Study Cabazitaxel Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Liver Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist : - screen phase ( maximum length 21-day ) . - treatment phase 21-day study treatment cycle . Cycle length may extend maximum 12 additional day case unresolved toxicity . Patients continue receive treatment experience , unacceptable toxicities/AEs , disease progression , withdraw consent , investigator decides discontinue patient , study cut-off , whichever come first . - 30-day follow-up visit last dose study medication . The cut date last patient treat complete cycle 1 subsequent 30 day follow-up . Patients may continue treat long benefit study treatment meet study withdrawal criterion .</detailed_description>
