	<detailed_description>For patient severe facial deformity facial wound traumatic injury , would like pursue use face transplant help reconstruct person 's damage face . Our goal give patient back normal appearance face also function , movement , sensation face include lip , mouth , eye . For patient severe face deformity simple task smile , talk , eat , kiss love one , even able contain saliva become difficult , impossible . These patient often become depressed facial deformity . Although technique plastic reconstructive surgery repair look patient 's face , often replace move part face . Currently , patient severe facial deformity would undergo several reconstructive surgery tissue , call autologous transplant . This surgery often leave unacceptable scar deformities patient 's donor site . Also , conventional reconstruction method require many return operate room carefully form shape transplant free flap . Lastly , type reconstruction still limit , provide reliable return function , sensation , appearance damage part face . Instead , use composite tissue allograft ( CTA ) , face transplant donor brain dead heart , kidney liver transplant , could replace damage part face miss part could return movement well . However , since transplant facial tissue another person , face transplant recipient need medicine would keep body reject new tissue . This new course medicine would daily responsibility . Though risk take medicine , risk lower many prior study do patient organ transplant . However , risk still consideration decide choose option correct severe facial deformity . This study aim perform face transplant person suffer severe facial trauma tissue functional loss , limited establish surgical option repair deformity . We conduct surgery prospectively follow patient monitor clinical functional outcome ensure optimal result achieve . We systematically document record entire process patient 's surgery recovery . An important factor surgery 's success patient strictly follow take require course medicine prevent rejection donor tissue . In order ensure tissue survives reject patient , continuously check various clinical value , blood work , tissue sample , x-ray image . We would like offer facial segment transplantation reconstructive option patient severe facial deformity . We feel facial transplantation become viable option certain patient . If successful , contribute future research development field tissue transplantation . Most importantly , goal offer patient best option reconstruction restore form function otherwise another option .</detailed_description>
