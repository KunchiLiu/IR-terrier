	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disorder cause mutation gene make cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . A specific type mutation call nonsense ( premature stop codon ) mutation cause CF approximately 10 % subject disease . Ataluren ( PTC124 ) orally deliver investigational drug potential overcome effect nonsense mutation . This study Phase 3 extension trial evaluate long-term safety ataluren ( PTC124 ) adult pediatric patient nonsense mutation CF , determine adverse event laboratory abnormality . The study also assess change pulmonary function , CF pulmonary exacerbation , health-related quality life , antibiotic use CF-related infection , CF-related disruption daily live , body weight , CF pathophysiology . Funding Source - FDA OOPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , open-label , safety efficacy study perform site North America , Europe , Israel . The study enroll approximately 208 patient nonsense mutation CF participate previous Phase 3 study ataluren ( PTC124 ) ( PTC124-GD-009-CF , NCT00803205 ) . Subjects receive study drug 3 time per day ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) approximately 48 week ( approximately 1 year ) . Study assessment perform clinic visit every 8 week .</detailed_description>
