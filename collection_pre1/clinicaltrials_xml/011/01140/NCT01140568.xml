	<brief_title>Study Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor ( PDGFR ) Recurrent Malignant Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma ( MG ) , include anaplastic glioma ( AG ) glioblastoma ( GBM ) , common primary brain tumor . Standard care ( surgery , radiotherapy , temozolomide initial diagnosis ) result median survival 14 month . For patient recurrent disease , conventional chemotherapy generally ineffective response rate &lt; 20 % . Clearly need improve treatment . Recent genome-wide study confirm GBM heterogeneous group diseases subclassified share genetic aberration . The implication , part , underlie genetics may determine responsiveness treatment thus allow u personalize therapy . This , open-label , non-randomized , phase II study oral nilotinib adult patient biomarker-enriched , recurrent malignant glioma develop tumor progression standard therapy . Patients treat oral nilotinib ( start label dose 400 mg ) daily disease progression intolerance . One cycle define 28 day . Approximately 50 evaluable patient enrol study , 32 ( grade IV ) 18 ( grade III ) separate arm . All patient undergo clinical evaluation 28-day cycle . Neuroimaging study ( MRI ) perform baseline , 4 week , 8 week every 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . If contraindication MRI 's exists , patient undergo contrast-enhanced CT scan . Laboratory test obtain weekly first 4 week , day 1 15 subsequent cycle . Patients remain study medication unless develop tumor progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability provide write informed consent prior participation study relate procedure perform . Participants must agree sign authorization release protect health information . Subjects must able adhere dose visit schedule , agree record medication time accurately consistently daily diary . Participants must life expectancy least 8 week . Patients great 18 year age . Histologically documented diagnosis prove glioblastoma ( GBM ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) . Patients eligible original local pathology lowergrade glioma . Pathology read centrally confirm diagnosis . Documentation amplify PDGFRA fluorescent insitu hybridization ( FISH ) , colorimetric insitu hybridization ( CISH ) , quantitative PCR tumor tissue ( = &gt; 3 copy number ) . Availability unstained paraffin slide paraffin block pretreatment baseline tissue require eligibility molecular analysis would help identify molecular predictor outcome ( patient ) . Participants must Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 . Adequate end organ function , define follow : Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL White blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L Biochemistry : AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x institution 's ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institution 's ULN Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institution 's ULN 24hour creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless consider tumor related Patients must follow laboratory value within normal limit ( WNL ) local institution lab correct WNL supplement prior first dose study medication . Potassium ( WNL ) Magnesium ( WNL ) Phosphorous ( WNL ) Calcium ( WNL ) Coagulation study : INR &lt; 1.5 PTT within institution 's normal range , unless receive therapeutic low molecular weight heparin Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day initiation study drug dosing . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Male female patient reproductive potential must agree employ effective barrier method birth control throughout study 3 month follow discontinuation study drug . Participants must unequivocal progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . A scan must perform within 14 day prior registration steroid dose stable least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI/CT require . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . A patient develops contraindication undergo MRI scan study treatment may remain study undergo contrast enhance CT scan . Patients must fail prior radiation therapy must interval great equal 60 day completion radiation therapy study entry . Subjects must recover toxic effect prior therapy . Residual toxicity previous treatment must ≤ Grade 1 . Patients must sufficient time recovery prior therapy : 28 day investigational agent , 28 day prior cytotoxic therapy ( except 23 day prior temozolomide , 14 day vincristine , 42 day nitrosoureas , 21 day procarbazine administration ) , 7 day noncytotoxic agent , e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc . ( radiosensitizer count ) . Patients prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base upon positron emission tomography ( PET ) , Thallium scanning , MR spectroscopy surgical documentation disease . Subjects undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible long follow condition apply : Prior initiate therapy , 4 week must elapse since surgery ; Subjects must recover surgicalrelated trauma ; Wound heal need occur . Patients receive PDGFR inhibitor ( imatinib , sunitinib , nilotinib , etc . ) previously exclude ( patient receive PDGFR antibody base treatment however allow ) . History intratumoral peritumoral hemorrhage deem significant treating physician . For patient require anticoagulation therapy , therapeutic low molecular weight heparin factor Xa inhibitor permit . Due potential interaction nilotinib enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAED ) , patient nonenzyme induce antiepileptic drug ( NEIAED ) antiepileptic drug eligible . Patient &lt; 3 year free another primary malignancy except : primary malignancy currently clinically neither significant require active intervention , primary malignancy basal cell skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . Existence malignant disease allow . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding , intend become pregnant study . Any significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patient rare hereditary problem galactose intolerance , severe lactase deficiency glucosegalactose malabsorption . Patients disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism . Patient electrolyte abnormality ( e.g. , hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , hypophosphatemia , hyperkalemia , hypocalcemia , hyponatremia ) unless level correct normal level prior initiate study drug . Patient known diagnosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Patient receive chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosourea ) prior study entry , unless disease rapidly progress . Concomitant use anticancer therapy radiation therapy , investigational agent . Impaired cardiac function include follow : Congenital long QT syndrome know family history long QT syndrome ; History presence clinically significant ventricular atrial tachyarrhythmias Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) Inability monitor QT interval ECG QTc &gt; 450 msec baseline ECG .
