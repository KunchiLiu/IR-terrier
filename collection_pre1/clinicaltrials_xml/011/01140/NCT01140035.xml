	<brief_summary>Every year US , shortage many thousand kidney need transplant . Furthermore , kidneys available transplanted often exhibit delayed slow graft function ( DGF SGF , respectively ) , lower quality life patient family require significant additional medical care . These need result significant preventable human suffer health care spending . To address need , investigator ' project test use intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) donor neurological determination death ( DNDDs ) intervention decrease acute kidney injury improve renal function time organ recovery . This translate decrease incidence DGF SFG recipient receive organ IIT group . The investigator also expect find trend toward increase number organ available transplant due good organ protection DNDD . Taken together , data provide requisite justification large study power evaluate effect IIT increase number kidney available transplantation . There evidence brain death often lead hyperglycemia may negatively impact organ DNDDs . These observation lead u conduct retrospective study , investigator find hyperglycemia DNDDs indeed associate decreased terminal renal function . Because report intensive insulin therapy ( ITT ) renoprotective ICU conventional insulin therapy ( CIT ) , investigator propose evaluate use IIT DNDDs : ( 1 ) improve organ function , ( 2 ) reduce DGF recipient , ( 3 ) possibly increase number kidney available transplant . Methods : This prospective observational study document impact IIT acute kidney injury DNDDS allograft function recipient . DNDDs divide two group : CIT IIT . In first study , investigator evaluate effect ITT biochemical parameter blood sample predict kidney health function DNDDs . All method use proposal well documented literature establish applicant 's laboratory . In investigator ' second study , compare effect ITT DNDDs graft function allograft recipient term number patient show either DGF SGF . Additionally , currently establish set advanced biochemical criterion DNDDs predict kidney function recipient . The investigator correlate evaluate biochemical marker kidney function health order possibly develop refine method predict transplant success . Such set criterion would useful design study systematically test additional intervention DNDDs improve organ function recovery increase number available organ . Taken together , result study may lead new therapy significantly improve patient outcomes significantly reduce disease associate cost . These result also set stage follow study increase number kidney available transplant .</brief_summary>
