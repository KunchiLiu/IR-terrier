	<detailed_description>Failure wean one feared complication mechanical ventilation . Prolonged mechanical ventilation occur 5-20 % patient require MV intensive care unit . The published experience Cleveland Clinic in-hospital-weaning unit ( ReSCU , Respiratory Special Care Unit ) long-term mechanical ventilation ( &gt; 14 day ) average , 60 % patient achieve complete ventilator independence . The identification factor predict liberation mechanical ventilation improve outcome allocation resource . Several attempt do develop model identify patient wean prolonged MV ; rely multiple measurement predictive ability uncertain . Given complexity medical problem heterogeneity patient prolong MV , unexpected order achieve good prediction , multiple variable need encompass whole population relevant factor associate failure wean . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) obtain measurement interval successive heart beat ; analysis use extensively cardiovascular disease . HRV interpreted manifestation neurohumoral autonomic system influence heart . Some researcher think HRV relate overall variability manifestation health complex biological system . Interpretation apart , multiple study demonstrate loss variability reflect poor prognosis overall . This phenomenon see heart , also breathe pattern , blood pressure , leukocyte count , electroencephalogram , gait , recently temperature . Limitations interpretation difficulty acquisition ( ventilator influence , respiratory rate influence , arrhythmia , medication ) make HRV less practical mechanically ventilated population . Surface temperature usually measure clinical practice ; reflect skin thermoregulatory property ( autonomic system fundamental role ) . Recently , novel marker describe biological variability body temperature study . The temperature curve complexity ( TCC ) use predict mortality critically ill patient . Its performance comparable score like APACHE SOFA , describe HRV , hence suggest relation TCC HRV . Although prior study relate TCC HRV alone prolong mechanical ventilation outcome , reason suspect variability decrease ventilator-dependent patient . In summary , analysis HRV TCC provide prognostic information critically ill patient . A relation HRV TCC expect described . Given multiple influence MV HRV , TCC may better indicator variability patient MV . Our primary hypothesis analysis HRV TCC predict failure wean prolong MV . Our secondary aim : identify relationship HRV TCC , describe TCC patient prolong MV , describe change HRV TCC patient successful fail weaning . This observational study measurement HRV TCC do patient admit ReSCU compare ability wean mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
