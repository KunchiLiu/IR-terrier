	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Intestinal transplantation ( ITx ) offer potential mean survival patient intestinal failure develop life threaten complication . Approximately 200 ITx procedure perform worldwide per year , 2200 procedure perform total , two third child . Overall , patient graft survival rate improve significantly past several year due innovation surgical technique , immunosuppression post-transplant management . One year patient survival rate approach 80-90 % experienced center . Nonetheless , acute cellular rejection ( ACR ) continue pose major challenge patient . Currently , gold standard diagnose ACR histological examination biopsy sample obtain time endoscopy . Limitations include fact endoscopy definition invasive , costly , associated risk bleed , infection , perforation , potentially inaccurate . ACR present patchy process may miss endoscopic surveillance 30 % time . It also present similar fashion infection , lead diagnostic dilemma optimal management patient . Such delays inaccuracy diagnosis management ITx recipients potential lead patient graft loss . New noninvasive technique monitor ACR clearly need continue drive field ITx forward . Proteomics allow identification protein possible biomarkers . Protein profile easily detect body fluid , make protein combination potentially innovative biomarkers useful diagnosis disease monitoring . Following protein metabolite level may prove accurate screen tool patient suspect ACR . In study , use high-throughput proteomic analysis candidate immunoassay protein detection ostomy effluent search non-invasive manner molecular profile epithelial stress innate immunity ACR . IMMUNOSUPPRESSION : All patient manage tacrolimus-based triple immunosuppression . Our standard immunosuppression regimen include induction interleukin-2 receptor antagonist daclizumab basiliximab , versus rabbit antithymocyte globulin . Maintenance therapy consist tacrolimus , corticosteroid , mycophenolate mofetil . Target tacrolimus trough level 10-15 ng/mL . Sirolimus use rescue agent part renal spar regimen . ACR diagnose histopathology treat high dose steroid . In patient severe ACR , ATG use rescue agent . In highly sensitized patient patient suspect antibody mediated rejection , combination plasmapheresis , Rituximab IVIG use . INTESTINAL SURVEILLANCE : Protocol biopsy transplant intestine obtain weekly begin postoperative day 7-14 first 3-4 week , every 2 week 8 week ITx . Endoscopy biopsy also obtain clinical symptom indicate abnormal allograft function . Multiple target biopsy obtain , paraffin-embedded section stain hematoxylin eosin ( H &amp; E ) grade ACR use standard rejection criterion one three UCLA gastrointestinal pathologist . Abnormal result prompt endoscopic surveillance indicate . OSTOMY EFFLUENT COLLECTION AND PROTEOMIC EVALUATION : Ostomy effluent collect , immediately place ice , batch process UCLA High Throughput Clinical Proteomics mass spectrometry core laboratory . All sample process analyzed triplicate use MALDI mass spectrometry . MALDI-MS spectrum convert text file , preprocessed use establish protocol . The preprocessed MALDI data export SpecAlign analyze R. ENZYME LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY : Human HNP 1-3 quantified duplicate process protein sample ELISA kit follow manufacturer 's instruction ( Cell Sciences , Canton , MA ) , use HNP1-3 standard curve construct plate . Protein concentration also determine test sample ( BCA , Pierce Thermo Scientific , Rockford , IL ) , HNP1-3 level normalize total protein ( pg/mg ) . For IHC , biopsy section deparaffinized , block background peroxidase activity goat antibody bind standard method , stain human anti-HNP 1-3 antibody ( rabbit , 1:2000 ) pre-immuned serum ( rabbit , 1:2000 ) negative control . The section incubate anti-Rabbit IgG biotinylated secondary antibody streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate tertiary antibody Vectastain Elite ABC kit ( Vector Laboratories ) accord manufacturer 's protocol , develop diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride ( DAB ) substrate solution ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . For IHC quantitation , 10 crypt three different field biopsy slide evaluate evidence significant defensin staining . The number defensin positive crypt count average . LUMINEX : An aliquot process ostomy effluent use Luminex evaluation , Bio-Rad human cytokine 17-plex assay accord manufacturer 's instruction ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Data acquire Bio-Plex 200 system analyze associate software ( Bio-Rad ) , cytokine concentration normalize protein concentration log transform .</detailed_description>
