	<brief_title>Exercise Program Early Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether 16-week exercise intervention improve component metastasis ( MetS ) breast cancer survivor soon completion cancer-related treatment measure change body composition , waist circumference , blood pressure , serum level insulin , glucose , lipid , C-reactive protein , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) . II . To determine whether 16-week exercise intervention improve physical fitness breast cancer survivor soon completion cancer-related treatment measure cardiorespiratory fitness muscle strength . III . To ass feasibility supervise exercise intervention early breast cancer survivor . IV . To determine whether 16-week exercise intervention result reduction adipose tissue inflammation obese breast cancer survivor soon completion cancer-related treatment measure ATM phenotype ATM cytokine expression . V. To determine whether breast cancer survivor maintain positive benefit exercise intervention follow 12-week follow-up period measure change body composition , waist circumference , blood pressure , serum level insulin , glucose , lipid , C-reactive protein , HbA1c , cardiorespiratory fitness muscle strength . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . Arm I ( Control ) : Patients refrain increase physical activity level 16 week . Arm II ( Exercise ) : Patients participate supervise exercise session 60 minute thrice weekly encourage participate home-based exercise session 30-45 minute weekly 16 week .</detailed_description>
