	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Determine Optimal Procedure Steps Obtain Maintain Uterine Artery Occlusion With D-UAO Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Group 1 - beginning use current instruction use ( IFU ) adjustment make necessary D-UAO procedural step uterine artery occlusion confirm 2/3-D Power Colour Doppler ultrasound ( 2/3DPD ) . 2 . Group 2 - verify optimal D-UAO IFU procedural step generate Group 1 confirm 2/3DPD . 3 . Group 3 - verify optimal D-UAO procedural step reproducible hand multiple surgeon addition group 1 investigator , confirm 2/3DPD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 2555 year regular menses least one symptom relate uterine fibroid ( example heavy bleeding ) . Completed childbearing . At least one uterine fibroid 3 cm diameter great prevail pathology ( e.g . opposed adenomyosis ) fibroid determine abdominal/transvaginal ultrasound . Confirmation ability clearly visualise bilateral uterine artery 2/3DPD . Dominant fibroid ( define &gt; 3cm diameter ) must well vascularise determine CEMRI ( Group 2 3 patient ) . Able tolerate require prolonged supine position treatment ( approximately 6 hour ) . Cervix suitable tenaculum placement determine pelvic exam . Normal Pap smear within last 36 month . Agrees participate study , follow review patient information sheet document agreement sign Ethics Committee approve informed consent . Prior endometrial ablation , uterine artery embolization , uterine artery ligation . Pregnancy ( As confirm urine pregnancy test screen immediately prior procedure ) . One low uterine segment fibroid determine pelvic exam examiner 's opinion would prevent proper clamp application . Any known contraindication contrast agent use CEMRI determine study radiologist ( Group 2 3 patient ) . Pelvic mass outside uterus suggest disease process . An intrauterine device ( IUD ) place day procedure . Hydronephrosis determine interpretation preprocedure renal ultrasound . No ureteral jet observe ultrasound prior clamp . Presence pedunculated fibroid determine ultrasound , hysteroscopy , saline infuse sonography CE MRI . Any current acute chronic systemic infection localize pelvic infection , include unresolved urinary tract infection . Clinical history thromboembolic disease . History gynecologic malignancy , atypical endometrial hyperplasia , pelvic inflammatory disease . Using anticoagulation therapy ( except OTC treatment , e.g . aspirin ) , know underlie bleed disorder . In investigator 's opinion , medical condition psychiatric illness could potentially life threaten affect ability complete study visit accord protocol .</criteria>
