	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis chronic inflammatory disorder gut cause major life-long disability . Afflicting mostly young people age active private professional life , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) represent important public health problem affect patient education , work ability , social life quality life . Previously disease predominantly West , mark increase incidence IBD Hong Kong . The cause dramatic increase last decade unknown . Genetic factor , environmental factor gut bacteria may play role disease development . This study aim explore factor may contribute , cause , rise IBD Hong Kong . The investigator propose study gut bacteria Chinese patient IBD compare non-IBD patient , healthy relative IBD patient . IBD patient prospectively recruit , blood sample obtain serology genotyping , stool sample biopsy collect routine colonoscopy microbiota analysis . Bloods , stool tissue gut microbiota non-IBD patient collect comparison . Studying gut microbiota , genetics environmental factor population change incidence IBD offer great hope identify potentially important causative factor disease .</detailed_description>

Controls exclude previously diagnose IBD first second degree relative IBD . Relatives group : Relatives patient age 16 35 year . They first degree relative patient . Relatives old 35 recruit maximise chance include individual develop IBD future . Relatives contact either via patient directly telephone investigator . They invite attend screen meeting assess eligibility receive information sheet . They undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy biopsy fully consent .
