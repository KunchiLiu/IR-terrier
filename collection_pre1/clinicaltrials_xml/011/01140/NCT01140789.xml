	<brief_title>Chinese Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory disorder gut cause major life-long disability . Afflicting mostly young people age active private professional life , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) represent important public health problem affect patient education , work ability , social life . In past two decade , incidence prevalence CD UC rapidly increase Asia . Familial aggregation , twin study , recent genetic study suggest important genetic component IBD . In West , genome wide association ( GWA ) study identify 50 gene associate CD include gene involve bacterial handling , NOD 2 , gene involve autophagy ATG16L1 IRGM . Only gene study Asian population . Of studied , NOD2 , clear difference Western population . To date GWA study carry cohort Caucasian patient . Genetic study ethnically different population may identify new causal variant IBD , likely lead insight pathophysiology potential treatment . The aim perform GWA study Chinese patient CD UC . Identifying new gene Chinese patient help investigator understand biological pathway function population incidence IBD increase . As part collaborative project China , aim collect blood sample 1600 IBD patient 2000 control subject Hong Kong conduct GWA study . Samples 300 IBD patient 500 control contribute collaborative project China .</detailed_description>
