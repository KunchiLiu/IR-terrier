	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : • To determine effect ketamine , block ion-channel gate NMDA receptor , performance cognitive task extent effect reverse dopamine receptor antagonist , risperidone . The secondary objective study : - To establish whether patient schizophrenia able reliably complete biomarker test battery ass whether response similar healthy volunteer treat ketamine . - To establish multi-site recruitment assessment capacity base share Standard Operating Procedures across three study centre .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study continuation previous study ( P1V-SCH-CT01-07 ) . The overall aim 2 study identify validate potential biomarker task may use provide early indication use new treatment schizophrenia . The study consider two potential model schizophrenia healthy volunteer , first model look high versus average schizotypy , schizotypy personality trait . The second model , explore study , ketamine infusion . Healthy volunteer identify advertise initially ask complete online questionnaire.Suitability next stage study base response online questionnaire . Telephone interview conduct assess suitability screening.Screening visit carry full medical lab screen undertaken . participant also complete number psychiatric questionnaire interview . If participant remain suitable invited assessment day randomise one four study medication arm . Participants complete biomarker task follow questionnaire , rating scale interview . Patients schizophrenia form 5th study arm receive medication . They complete biomarkers way healthy volunteers.87 participant plan , 72 healthy volunteer , 15 patient schizophrenia . This study test investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) ethical issue associate introduce participant study drug applicable study . Ketamine already widely use anaesthetic agent give sub-anaesthetic dos useful tool model schizophrenia psychosis . The current study aim assess sensitivity battery biomarker task ( biomarkers measure process go wrong illness contribute symptom ) cognitive deficit induce ketamine . It may future possible evaluate effect novel treatment schizophrenia healthy volunteer use model , would potentially provide rapid indication potential efficacy candidate compound early phase drug development . The study provide information sensitivity biomarker task detect effect pharmacological treatment schizophrenia healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
