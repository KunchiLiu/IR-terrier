	<brief_summary>This phase I study test safety different dose patient immune cell change help recognize destroy cancer cell . The investigator want find effect , good and/or bad , body prostate cancer . The immune cell ( T cell ) use study patient immune cell . They remove patient blood , change laboratory , put back body . T cell help body fight infection . These cell may also kill cancer cell case . Right patient T cell unable kill cancer cell . For reason , physician change T cell put gene may able good recognize kill prostate cancer cell . A gene portion information come DNA tell cell . This gene put patient T cell weaken virus . It hop approach help T cell recognize prostate cancer tumor cell possibly kill . The investigator find T cell modify way able cure cancer similar Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia mouse . However , entirely new treatment prostate cancer know beneficial unexpected harmful effect .</brief_summary>
