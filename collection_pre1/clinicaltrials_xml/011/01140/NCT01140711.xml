	<brief_title>Functional MRI Evaluation Brain Response Visual Food Stimulation Morbidly Obese Patients Before After Bariatric Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery mediate weight-loss via one several mechanism inherent technique use . Surgical restriction `` low common denominator '' share , various extent , procedure . Different degrees malabsorption utilized `` bypass procedure '' Roux-Y gastric bypass ( GBP ) , biliopancreatic diversion ( BPD ) biliopancreatic diversion duodenal switch ( BPD-DS ) . These surgical option differ , also , degree weight loss promote . This difference due several factor include extent appetite suppression , increase energy expenditure degree malabsorption achieve different procedure . A post-operative change gut-brain hormonal axis component recently draw much attention research still ill define . It effect , presumably mediate change myriad peptide hormone originate mostly intestinal tract , elicit change hunger satiety feeling well change drive eat . Generally speak , patient sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) bypass procedure mention , decrease appetite report reduce drive seek food , presumably contribute weight loss . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) image modality measure hemodynamic response ( change blood flow ) related neural activity brain , therefore allow map area brain become active due discrete stimulus . Recent study utilize fMRI study neural response hunger satiety state , well food anticipation ingestion , map discrete area brain respond stimulus . Fuhrer colleague find hunger , significantly enhance brain activity find leave striate extrastriate cortex , inferior parietal lobe , orbitofrontal cortex . Stimulation food image associate increased activity insulae , leave striate extrastriate cortex , anterior midprefrontal cortex . Nonfood image associate enhanced activity right parietal lobe leave right middle temporal gyrus1 . Stice colleague report brain imaging study suggest obese relative lean individual show great activation gustatory cortex ( insula/frontal operculum ) oral somatosensory region ( parietal operculum Rolandic operculum ) response anticipate intake consumption palatable food . Ghrelin orexigenic ( appetite stimulating ) peptide secrete foregut prior meal therefore consider `` meal initiator '' . Obese patient low ghrelin level maintain normal diurnal variation peptide , patient GBP , reduce ghrelin level remain low throughout day 3 . Malik co-worker demonstrate ghrelin administer intravenously healthy volunteer fMRI neural response food picture affect . The neural effect ghrelin correlate self-rated hunger rating . Leptin adipocyte-derived circulate hormone provide information brain regard energy store . The brain 's response leptin involve change energy expenditure food intake . Farooqi co-worker report data suggest leptin act neural circuit govern food intake diminish perception food reward enhance response satiety signal generate food consumption . Peptide YY3-36 ( PYY ) gut-derived satiety signal whose level increase meal ingestion . Intravenous infusion PYY human volunteer show cause decrease food consumption self-reported feeling hunger . It also able alter neuronal activity within corticolimbic higher-cortical area well homeostatic brain region . Levels PYY low obese subject , show gradually increase early 2 day GBP , perhaps contribute success procedure term appetite control . GLP-1 ( glucagons-like peptide 1 ) , like PYY , anorexigenic ( appetite suppressing ) signal . It secrete gut meal reduces food intake effect brain-stem , well decrease rate gastric empty add feel fullness meal . Like PYY , GLP-1 level low obese patient increase dramatically follow GBP , contribute weight loss well improvement glucose tolerance operation . Several correlation assess : 1 . Correlation subjective reporting hunger/satiety fMRI image . 2 . Change neural response food-neutral food-related picture , follow operation ( vs. 1m vs. 6m procedure ) . 3 . Difference two surgical procedure ( SG vs.GBP ) regard neural response food image . 4 . Correlation gut-derived appetite-regulating hormone blood level subjective report hunger/satiety fMRI image different time point . 5 . Correlation measure parameter change weight , BMI excess weight loss .</detailed_description>
