	<brief_title>A Trial Photodynamic Therapy With HPPH Treatment Dysplasia , Carcinoma Situ T1 Carcinoma Oral Cavity and/or Oropharynx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose initiate Phase 1 clinical trial use HPPH 665 nm light patient cancer oral cavity and/or oropharynx , include lesion moderate severe dysplasia , squamous carcinoma situ T1 squamous cell carcinoma . The study employ fix HPPH dose 4 mg/m2 infuse 1 hour , 24 hour later light dos escalate 100 J/cm2 125 140 J/cm2 , respectively . The primary goal determination maximally tolerate PDT dose . Preliminary evidence PDT efficacy wil also obtain .</detailed_description>
