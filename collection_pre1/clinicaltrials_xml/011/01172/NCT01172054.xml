	<detailed_description>VAX128-01 first human study three inactivate recombinant novel H1N1 influenza vaccine , designate VAX128 A , B C. The purpose study compare safety immunogenicity three vaccine range dos select one vaccine test phase II study . We plan assess safety immunogenicity dose escalate study . The study enroll 100 healthy young adult ( 18-49 year ) 100 healthy adult age 65 year . We include old adult phase 1 study find elderly tolerate vaccine similar one candidate , VAX128A , good young adult , require high vaccine dose achieve similar antibody response . Nevertheless , test two construct ( VAX128B C ) , make conservative assumption safety immunogenicity data come young adult predict result elderly . Therefore , begin study young adult first three dose level test begin test old adult . In study plan enroll 100 young adult 100 adult 65 year old . The young adult likely enrol one clinical site old adult enrol another clinical site . We plan enroll cohort 10 young adult 10 old adult every week . Each cohort consist 3 subject receive one three vaccine ( 9 subject total ) one subject cohort receive placebo . Dosing next cohort base two day assessment period vaccination . The main part study conduct 28 day two follow phone call 6 month one year .</detailed_description>
