	<brief_summary>Malnutrition , include muscle waste commonly occur child cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , negatively influence quality life survival . At time diagnosis CF , severe protein deficit already present . It important get CF child feed adequately prevent condition become bad recovery take longer . Oral supplementation trial show gain lean body mass difficult achieve CF unless specific metabolic abnormality target . However , specific need certain food component clear yet child ill . Therefore , information necessary need protein certain amino acid child CF . Previous study support concept essential amino acid ( EAA ) anabolic stimulus young elderly insulin resistant state . Until yet information present anabolic effect EAA CF . It therefore hypothesis high-leucine essential amino acid mixture specifically design stimulate protein anabolism target metabolic alteration pediatric subject CF . In present proposal , acute metabolic effect high leucine essential amino acid mixture examine pediatric subject CF compare regular balance total mixture essential non-essential amino acid . The principal endpoint extent stimulation whole body protein synthesis principal mechanism either amino acid protein intake cause muscle anabolism , reduction endogenous protein breakdown . Both endpoint assess isotope methodology think reference method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , test follow hypothesis : A high-leucine essential amino acid mixture ( dose 6.7 g ) stimulate protein anabolism great extent standard balance mixture total ( essential non-essential ) amino acid CF pediatric subject . The principal endpoint extent stimulation protein synthesis rate reduction endogenous protein breakdown . The current project provide information enable u good understand underlie metabolic mechanism regulate protein metabolism pediatric subject CF .</detailed_description>
