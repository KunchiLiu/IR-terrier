	<brief_summary>Treatment child infant HIV require modification medication dose accord child 's specific weight . For lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , second line treatment option increasingly necessary due infant drug resistance , dose often complicate impractical busy clinical setting . To address , World Health Organization ( WHO ) release simplified dose table base infant weight band . This study evaluate absorption , safety , tolerance LPV/r infant dose accord new WHO guideline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II/III Trial Lopinavir/Ritonavir Dosed According WHO Pediatric Weight Band Dosing Guidelines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because previous exposure nevirapine non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) , either direct treatment mother pregnancy , infant must often receive alternate antiretroviral regimen include LPV/r . Dosing LPV/r currently base child 's specific weight , calculation proper dosage often complicate practical busy clinic , particularly limited resource setting . In order simplify medication delivery reduce prescribe error , WHO release dose schedule LPV/r base grouping infant child weight . This study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerance LPV/r dose accord guideline . The following stratum use guide accrual : Number Participants Enrolled Weight Band : 3-4.9 kg : 11 liquid 5-6.9 kg : 11 liquid 7-9.9 kg : 17 liquid 10-16.9 kg : 11 liquid , 22 tablet 17-19.9 kg : 11 tablet 20-24.9 kg : 11 tablet Participation study last 6 month . Infant participant caretaker need attend study visit entry Weeks 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 . At entry , participant give LPV/r either liquid tablet form , depend whether swallow pill . Dosing calculated use WHO schedule . At study visit , participant undergo physical exam caretaker ask well child take study medication . In addition , Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , blood sample take participant determine health level medication body . The visit Week 4 also require pharmacokinetic testing , mean child need monitor hospital 12 hour complete six additional blood drawl . All study visit last 1 2 hour .</detailed_description>
