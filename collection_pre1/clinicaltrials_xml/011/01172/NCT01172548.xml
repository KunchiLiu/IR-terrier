	<brief_summary>GISTs common mesenchymal tumor gastrointestinal tract . Approximately 95 % GISTs positive KIT ( CD117 ) -the receptor stem cell factor ( SCF ) . GISTs responsive conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy disease often recur even complete resection wide margin . Imatinib mesylate ( trade name : Glivec® Gleevec® , imatinib , formerly STI571 ) signal transduction inhibitor target several protein-tyrosine kinase believe play role proliferation tumor cell . In Phase II study imatinib [ CSTI571B 2222 ] 147 patient recurrent metastatic GIST , partial response rate 67 % 66 % patient treat 400 mg/d 600 mg/d , respectively . Skin rash elevate transaminase common reason drug discontinuation . The frequently report AEs mild nausea , vomit , diarrhea , superficial edema ( primarily periorbital low limb ) , myalgia muscle cramp . Grade 3/4 event include fluid retention ( pleural pericardial effusion , ascites , pulmonary edema ) , skin rash , liver toxicity gastrointestinal ( GI ) hemorrhage . Myelosuppression ( neutropenia thrombocytopenia ) consistent find . Also , tumor lysis-like syndrome occur patient lead gastrointestinal ( GI ) and/or intratumoral hemorrhage . In Phase 3 , American College Surgeons Oncology Group trial ( ACOSOG Z9001 ) adjuvant imatinib , imatinib significantly improve 1-year recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) compare placebo . In summary , clinical trial show imatinib produce clinical benefit patient unresectable metastatic GIST extend median survival 19 57 month . Imatinib standard care advanced GIST receive regulatory approval treatment unresectable metastatic GIST . Studies suggest adjuvant imatinib 1 year prolongs RFS patient high risk recurrent disease metastases follow complete surgical resection primary GIST . Imatinib appeal adjuvant therapy resect GIST : 1 . Patients primary GIST high chance tumor recurrence 2 . Conventional adjuvant treatment modality ineffective 3 . Imatinib specifically inhibit Kit receptor constitutively activate GISTs 4 . Imatinib inhibit growth Kit positive cell vitro 5 . Imatinib highly effective many patient advanced GIST Phase II trial 6 . Imatinib associate minimal toxicity patient advanced GIST patient chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) 7 . Imatinib may greatest impact survival minimal disease . Primary - To assess Recurrence Free Survival Rate patient resect primary GIST treat adjuvant imatinib duration 2 year Secondary - To compare Recurrence Free Survival , Overall Survival , Time Recurrence patient resect primary GIST treat adjuvant imatinib duration 2 year historical data To assess safety imatinib give adjuvant therapy 2 year patient resect primary GIST</brief_summary>
