	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Genetically-modified neural stem cell ( NSCs ) convert 5-fluorocytosine ( 5-FC ) chemotherapy agent 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) sit tumor brain may effective treatment glioma . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study genetically-modified NSCs 5-FC patient undergo surgery recurrent high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Feasibility Study Oral 5-Fluorocytosine Genetically-Modified Neural Stem Cells Expressing E.Coli Cytosine Deaminase Treatment Recurrent High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility intracerebral administration NSCs combination oral 5-FC patient recurrent high-grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize relationship intracerebral systemic concentration 5-FC 5-FU increase NSC dose level . II . To non-invasively assess presence 5-FU brain use fluorine ( 19F ) -magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) ( longer effect 5/1/2012 ) . III . To assess possible development immunogenicity NSCs . IV . To assess intracerebral distribution NSCs use iron-labeling cellular tracker . V. To gather preliminary imaging data regard perfusion permeability parameter image characteristic show magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study due presence NSCs brain . VI . To determine , time autopsy , fate NSCs . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . After biopsy surgery resect tumor , study patient receive injection genetically modify NSCs directly brain tissue day 0 . Patients take oral 5-FC every 6 hour day 4-10 convert 5-FU brain NSCs . Follow-up MRIs brain perform day 32 , 60 , every 2 month thereafter assess response side effect .</detailed_description>
