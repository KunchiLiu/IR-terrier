	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>The subject &gt; 18 year age . The subject acceptable candidate PTCA , stenting , emergent CABG . Patients multiple lesion long last lesion treat fit Inclusion criterion target lesion . The subject must clinical evidence ischemic heart disease positive functional study . The study stent target vessel must native coronary artery stenosis &gt; 50 % &lt; 100 % . The study stent target vessel reference diameter must &gt; 2.5 mm ≤ 3.0 mm . ( Measurements may make careful visual estimate online quantitative coronary angiography . ) The study stent target lesion de novo lesion previously stented . The study stent target lesion must ≤ 14 mm length thus allow adequate lesion coverage single stent . The subject male , female , either childbearing potential negative pregnancy test within seven ( 7 ) day prior procedure . The subject subject 's legal representative inform nature study provide write informed consent approve Institutional Ethics Committee ( IEC ) clinical site . The subject treating physician agree subject return require postprocedure followup visit . Multiple lesion treat target vessel . Patients require one BioFreedom stent except additional BioFreedom stent may implant target lesion geographic miss bailout A document left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 % assess within 6 month prior procedure echocardiography , previous angiography measure preprocedure angiography . A known hypersensitivity contraindication aspirin , heparin , bivalirudin , ticlopidine , clopidogrel , stainless steel , Biolimus A9 , Paclitaxel sensitivity contrast medium , adequately premedicated . A platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³ , WBC &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³ . Evidence acute myocardial infarction within 72 hour intend treatment ( define : Q wave nonQ wave infarction CK enzymes &gt; 2 time upper laboratory normal presence CKMB elevate institution upper limit normal ) . A previous coronary interventional procedure perform either . ) within 24 hour prior procedure b . ) within 12 month prior procedure lesion target vessel . The subject require planned interventional treatment lesion either target vessel within 12 month nontarget vessel within 30 day postprocedure . The target nontarget lesion require treatment device PTCA prior stent placement ( , limit , directional coronary atherectomy , excimer laser , rotational atherectomy , etc. ) . The target vessel angiographic evidence thrombus excessively ( 2 bend &gt; 90º reach target lesion ) tortuous . The target lesion follow characteristic : 1 . Lesion location aortoostial , leave main coronary artery , within 5 mm origin LAD , LCX , RCA . 2 . Is &gt; 45º bend vessel . 3 . Is moderately severely calcify ( visible fluoro ) . Stenting target nontarget lesion would `` jail '' cover side branch &gt; 2.0 mm diameter occur ostium sidebranch . History stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within prior 6 month permanent neurologic deficit . History upper GI bleeding within prior 6 month . The subject history bleed diathesis coagulopathy refuse blood transfusion . Concurrent medical condition life expectancy le 18 month . Currently participate investigational drug another device study complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current study endpoint . [ Note : Trials require extend followup product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational trial . ] Any contraindication mention TaxusTM LiberteTM Instructions Use ( IFU ) .</criteria>
