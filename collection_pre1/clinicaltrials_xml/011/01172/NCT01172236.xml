	<detailed_description>The study arises need structure care identify product natural antioxidant propriety may reduce extent damage perinatal neurological disorder relate oxidative stress limit pain infant family simultaneously reduce cost SSN arise standard pharmacological therapy rehabilitation short medium term . The research result remain available scientific community use profit commercial . The iron ( Fe ) abundant transition metal1 body essential element growth welfare almost life2 play key role many biochemical processes3 . It essential cofactor many enzymatic reaction catalyst process electron transport , yet potentially toxic rarely available . In presence oxygen Fe cause harmful action cell since enhances production non-enzymatic reactive oxygen specie . The hydroxyl radical particular , damage various cellular component DNA , proteins membrane lipid . All body therefore developed strategy allow retain Fe acquire soluble , nontoxic form readily available . The Fe excess , also cause weak bond metal nonspecific specific plasma protein may carry negative effect generate free radical reaction Fenton Heber-Weiss4 . Physiological requirement Fe high period rapid growth differentiation , perinatal nervous system develop rapidly late fetal life early neonatal period , appear particularly sensitive modulation Fe contents5 In newborn inability regulate , necessary , uptake Fe immature gut may reason failure / excess metal . Both situation may adverse effect neurological development infant case failure become irreversible even6-8 supplementation improve autcome9-11 . In case event occur early childhood adverse effect neuronal function adult . The mechanism iron deficiency affect brain development completely unknown know range general lack metabolic error myelination synaptogenesis change specific funcions12 . It also suggest adverse clinical outcome premature infant receive blood transfusion / colonization13 may relate oxidative damage14-17 &lt; br &gt; The main source food newborn breast milk formula . Breast milk contain heme Fe consequently non-heme Fe , bound milk protein substance low molecular weight , main source Fe diet infant . The child able regulate absorption iron gut , response supplementation , near first year life,18 inability infant regulate intestinal absorption predispose deficiency Fe diet insufficient , overload , level diet high . It also suggest enrichment Fe young child may lead increase plasma concentration formation nonspecific compound ( nonspecific bind protein low affinity bond ) give rise so-called free Fe ( NPBI ) originate reactive oxygen specie . Some author demonstrate increased oxidative stress infant low birth weight subject large oral iron supplementation , especially breastfed seno.19-21 Although gestational age clinical treatment transfusion ventilation consider increased risk oxidative damage Fe-indotto.22 Since status Fe breast-fed term infant usually satisfactory , least sixth month , important part Fe human milk bound lactoferrin , previously suggest effect protective human milk relate presence protein fix Fe regulate absorption . The lactoferrin iron-binding protein , naturally find high concentration breast milk low concentration fluid esocrini23 . For size structure lactoferrin closely link another group Fe-related protein , transferrin consider many member family . Lactoferrin bind iron high affinity binding structure unusually resistant proteolytic degradation . Besides regulate absorption iron inflammatory process infettivi24 performs several physiological function include antibacterial , antifungal , antivirale25 , antiparassitary26 , antitumoral27 , immunomodulator28-29 . This ability antibacterial antiviral property , may explain low prevalence shorter duration infection breast-fed infant . In human milk lactoferrin play antioxidant sequester free ion Fe30 thus prevent lipid peroxidation subsequent milk oxidation31 . Some AA.32 show property vitro use salt Fe ion presence biological agent reduce ascorbato33 . A recent study also demonstrate antioxidant effect blood34 . Again lactoferrin able bind free Fe , bind study , avoid sure trigger series chain reaction produce free radical thus reduces damage induce oxidative stress . This explain breastfed child significantly high total antioxidant capacity significantly low index oxidative stress . A recent study infant supply formula supplement lactoferrin show presence protein help absorption Fe small gut . The study suggest activity could stimulate proliferation differentiation mucosal cell gut35 , thus increase surface turn increase absorption nutrient . Studies pregnancy woman 36 suggests lactoferrin may anti-inflammatory effect , also improve Fe status woman .</detailed_description>
