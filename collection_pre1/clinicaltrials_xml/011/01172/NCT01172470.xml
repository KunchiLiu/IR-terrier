	<criteria>All previously irradiate patient recurrent head neck cancer clinically measurable distant disease patient distant disease low volume local regional palliation clinically warrant . Low volume metastatic disease define asymptomatic minimally symptomatic disease , accord physician judgment without therapy locoregionally recurrent disease , unlikely effect subject 's quality quantity life . Histologic cytological documentation recurrent head neck cancer require regional therapy . Prior radiation therapy complete &gt; 4 month study entry , patient recover side effect grade 1 . Predominance disease amenable radiotherapy . Measurable disease prior induction chemotherapy . Age &gt; 18 year Life expectancy great 12 week Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/ul Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/ul Platelets &gt; 100,000/ul Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5X institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine Clearance ( CrCl ) &gt; 45 mL/min The standard Cockcroft Gault formula ( base actual weight ) measure glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) use appropriate radiolabeled method ( 51CrEDTA Tc99mDTPA ) must use calculate CrCl enrollment dosing . The method use baseline use throughout study . Insufficient number patient study creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min give dose recommendation . Therefore , pemetrexed administer patient whose creatinine clearance &lt; 45 mL/min . Although ibuprofen nonsteroidal inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) administer pemetrexed patient normal renal function ( creatinine clearance 80 mL/min ) , caution use administer NSAID concurrently pemetrexed patient mild moderate renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance 45 79 mL/min ) . Patients mild moderate renal insufficiency avoid take NSAID short elimination half life ( e.g . ibuprofen ) period 2 day , day , 2 day follow administration pemetrexed . In absence data regard potential interaction pemetrexed NSAID longer half life , patient take NSAID interrupt dose least 5 day , day , 2 day follow pemetrexed administration . If concomitant administration NSAID necessary , patient monitor closely toxicity , especially myelosuppression , renal , gastrointestinal toxicity . The presence significant infection another severe complicate medical illness may constitute contraindication entrance protocol . Pregnancy absolute contraindication treatment protocol . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Ability swallow vitamins dexamethasone willingness use feed tube ingest agent Previously untreated patient eligible Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical composition agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
