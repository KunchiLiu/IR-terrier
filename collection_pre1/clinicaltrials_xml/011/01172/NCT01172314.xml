	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occur lung cancer patient , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Gains lean body mass difficult achieve cancer unless specific metabolic abnormality target . It hypothesis nutritional supplement contain high amount essential amino acid target metabolic alteration cancer patient . Preliminary research perform laboratory elderly support hypothesis . We hypothesize intake essential amino acid nutritional supplement positively influence protein synthesis rate advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . Furthermore , insight underlie mechanism high anabolic response essential amino acid supplement examine . This information potentially enable u formulate supplement effective normal food intake , reduce need muscle protein breakdown .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Essential Amino Acid Intake Net Protein Synthesis Weight-losing Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , test follow hypothesis : A high-leucine essential amino acid mixture stimulate whole body protein synthesis ( way protein anabolism ) large extent regular balance mixture total ( essential non-essential ) amino acid NSCLC patient without recent weight loss . The principal endpoint extent stimulation protein synthesis rate principal mechanism either amino acid protein intake cause muscle anabolism . This project provide important clinical information , base novel fundamental basic knowledge process specific underlie mechanisms muscle waste patient NSCLC , role EAA potential anabolic substrate . In way , provide preliminary data development nutritional strategy prevent even stop process ongoing muscle loss NSCLC .</detailed_description>
