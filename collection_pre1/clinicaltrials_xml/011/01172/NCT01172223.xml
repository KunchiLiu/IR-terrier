	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy affect female northern Europe North America , correspond age-corrected annual incidence 100 120 per 100000 female . Approximately 30-40 % patient treat curative intent develop metastatic disease . Perioperative systemic treatment make major impact relapse-free overall survival woman early-stage breast cancer [ , ] therapeutic strategy base endocrine responsiveness estimate risk relapse define tumor size , axillary lymph node involvement , histologic nuclear grade , lymphatic and/or vascular invasion , HER2/neu-overexpression age [ ] . Perioperative therapy traditionally administer postoperatively , chemotherapy increasingly utilized preoperative setting significantly improve rate breast conserve surgery , new regimen evaluate rapidly precisely .</detailed_description>
