	<brief_summary>A new approach treat solid tumour ( operable inoperable ) carry Cork Cancer Research Centre ( CCRC ) Mercy University Hospital , Cork , Ireland since 2002 . The approach simply allow great concentration chemotherapy drug enter tumour cell rather healthy cell . The uptake chemotherapeutic drug directly tumour aid apply short electric pulse tumor mass ( refer - Electrochemotherapy ECT ) . The pulse make tumour porous allows drug easy access cancer cell , whereas tissue organ body remain relatively poor absorb drug , thereby reduce potential side effect healthy tissue . This approach date limit skin base tumour due requirement electrode place directly contact tumour . Procedures electrochemotherapy apply human patient country EU , US Japan . The drug concentration use significantly reduce due target absorption tumor significantly reduce side effect normally associate chemotherapy . A large number preclinical clinical Phase I I/II study demonstrate efficiency safety ECT . These study include patient melanoma , head neck squamous cell carcinoma , merkel cell carcinoma , basal cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma nodule . Case report concern primary tumour also report . The investigator develop endoscopic approach ( EndoVe system ) deliver electric pulse internal cancer currently seek evaluate efficacy treatment inoperable colorectal cancer . The treatment procedure similar standard endoscopic colorectal examination ( colonoscopy ) add element intravenous injection bleomycin follow eight minute delivery electric pulse ( one less 1msec duration ) . The pulse endoscopically deliver directly tumour mass . The entire procedure minimally invasive require intensive care follow stitch . If treatment successful tumour shrink size week follow procedure . The objective study investigate efficacy safety approach reduce size tumour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Treatment Inoperable Colorectal Cancer With EndoVe System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective conduct treatment minimally invasive manner ( use endoscope ) without requirement repeat dos chemotherapy . The single dose drug use ( 15,000 IU/m2 x Body Surface Area bleomycin ) well tolerated patient treat previously approach skin base cancer ( excess 300 treatment since 2003 hospital ) . Therefore , anticipate patient unlikely suffer side effect low concentration drug use . There known side effect instrument test . The pulse generator use certified European electrical safety body charge assess compliance new equipment present security rule electrical device . The electrical pulse generator CE mark approve use clinically ; endoscopic electrode use prototype system currently CE approve . The treatment provide outpatient basis involve overnight stay . The procedure similar colonoscopy examination add element low dose chemotherapy drug inject intravenously . It reduce operative time ; therefore few anaesthetic risk At time , option patient inoperable colorectal cancer symptom relief e.g . defunctioning colostomy stent placement . Both carry risk profile great treatment EndoVe system . Quicker recovery time- This beneficial patient term reduce exposure hospital environment short in-patient stay . Research : The potential benefit study novel medical instrument general include development new alternative conventional exist therapy certain cancer . In particular , widespread availability novel instrument test may lessen requirement invasive procedure . It reduce amount chemotherapy drug use , therefore reduce systemic effect well side effect . The approach currently apply inoperable case future may potentially apply early stage cancer internal cancer e.g . oesophagus , stomach etc . Because treatment procedure short ( outpatient basis ) , allow patient great time outside hospital environment maximise allow great quality life ( individual patient community large ) . If treatment approach proven safe effective , patient inoperable colorectal cancer minimally invasive option palliation symptom .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically verified colorectal tumour . 2 . Case review multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) ( surgery , radiology , oncology , gastroenterology ) curable option standard care . The MDT considers available treatment option enrolment study agree appropriate ; Or case curable patient refuse undergo standard care . The MDT considers possible alternative , also discuss patient , MDT consider enrolment study appropriate option ; Or patient advanced local disease impend obstruction endoscopic evaluation otherwise suitable surgical intervention stenting , MDT would also consider patient enrolment study . 3 . Men woman age least 18 year . 4 . Performance status ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ECOG/WHO &lt; 2 ) . 5 . Treatment free interval least 2 week previously apply therapy . 6 . Patients must mentally capable understanding information give . 7 . Patients must give write informed consent . 8. ) A female NonChildbearing potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant ) eligible participate study : hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal : 1 . Coagulation disorder 2 . Patients preexist renal dysfunction exclude . [ Note : Creatinine clearance measure patient . For Bleomycin treatment : creatinine clearance must great 40ml/min . ] 3 . Patients clinically manifest arrhythmia pacemaker 4 . Patients epilepsy . 5 . Pregnancy lactation/breastfeeding . 6 . Patient known Hepatitis B/C HIV positive . 7 . Concurrent treatment investigational medicinal product participation another clinical study . 8 . Patients undergone regime Bevacizumab previous 4 week . 9 . Patients clinical condition prior therapy , opinion investigator , would make patient unsuitable study unable comply study requirement . 10 . Highly inflame colon tissue ulcerate bleeding . Additional exclusion criterion specifically regard patient Bleomycin study drug : 11 . Contraindications bleomycin use include acute pulmonary infection severe pulmonary disease . 12 . Contraindication bleomycin use : allergic reaction bleomycin observe previous treatment . 13 . Contraindication bleomycin use : cumulative dose 250mg BLM/m2 previously exceed . Additional exclusion criterion specifically regard patient Cisplatin study drug : 14 . Patients hypersensitivity Cisplatin platinum compound excipients exclude receive Cisplatin study . 15 . Cisplatin contraindicate combination live vaccine , include yellow fever vaccine . 16 . Cisplatin contraindicate combination phenytoin prophylactic use . 17 . Cisplatin contraindicate patient myelosuppression . 18 . Cisplatin contraindicate patient dehydrate condition ( pre posthydration require prevent serious renal dysfunction ) . 19 . Cisplatin contraindicate patient preexist hearing impairment . 20 . Cisplatin contraindicate patient neuropathy cause cisplatin . 21 . Contraindication Cisplatin use : Allergic reaction Cisplatin observe previous treatment .</criteria>
