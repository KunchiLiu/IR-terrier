	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Temsirolimus Treat Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temsirolimus inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , crucial regulator cell cycle progression . It approve treatment advance renal cell carcinoma . Temsirolimus demonstrate also antitumor activity variety human cancer model , glioma , rhabdomyosarcoma , neuroblastomas , prostata breast cancer induction apoptosis inhibition proliferation . A similar effect note HNSCC cell line . This first study evaluate efficacy safety temsirolimus platinum/cetuximab-refractory HNSCC .</detailed_description>
