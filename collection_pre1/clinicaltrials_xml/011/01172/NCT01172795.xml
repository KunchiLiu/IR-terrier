	<brief_summary>Diffuse noxious inhibitory control In order quantify central sensitization chronic pain patient , Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Control ( DNIC ) model use frequently . DNIC rely painful condition stimulation one part body inhibit pain another part , remove `` noise '' focus relevant stimulus . Earlier study provide evidence malfunction DNIC Fibromyalgia ( FM ) patient . However , cause impairment yet elucidate , study require unravel pathophysiology DNIC FM . Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal ( HPA ) axis Besides neural mechanism , also hormonal abnormality could cause alter pain processing . Cortisol release answer pain suppress pain . Given evidence hypofunction hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis lower cortisol release response stressor proportion FM patient chronic whiplash associate disorder ( WAD ) patient , relation pain cortisol patient may interest topic consider . Neurocognitive performance Besides chronic pain , people chronic WAD FM suffer severe concentration difficulty decrease neurocognitive capability ( reduce reaction time , short term memory deficit etc . The decreased neurocognitive performance know related pain severity various chronic pain population . It hypothesize malfunction descend inhibitory pathway subsequent chronic pain experience precludes optimal neurocognitive performance . Objectives The present investigation address ( patho ) physiological mechanism DNIC chronic pain population . 1 . Firstly , patient FM , chronic WAD healthy control compare regard function DNIC , cortisol level response neurocognitive performance ( case-control ) . 2 . Secondly , possible interaction function DNIC , cortisol neurocognitive performance study patient FM , WAD healthy control subject ( cross-sectional ) . 3 . Thirdly , examine whether fatigue neurocognitive stressor change DNIC cortisol level patient FM , chronic WAD healthy sedentary control subject .</brief_summary>
