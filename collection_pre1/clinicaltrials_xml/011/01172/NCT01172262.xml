	<brief_summary>Tinnitus poorly understand symptom often describe either ring , click , ocean sound , nature sound . There cure tinnitus . Approximately 50 million Americans affect small minority severely affect . This study target patient tinnitus severely bother . Through MRI investigator plan evaluate cortical network brain hop well understand complex process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Task-Based Functional MRI ( fMRI ) Patients With Severely Bothersome Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tinnitus perceive sensation sound without actual acoustic stimulation affect 50 million Americans , 15 million significantly bother . Using functional connectivity MRI ( fcMRI ) , investigator find distinct difference cortical attention network patient bothersome tinnitus age-matched control . These novel finding suggest classic disturb characteristic tinnitus result derangement cortical pathway . Using validated task-based functional MRI ( fMRI ) paradigm develop Washington University , investigator explore ventral dorsal frontoparietal cortical attention network patient bothersome tinnitus non-tinnitus control . This experimental task-based fMRI pilot study involve neurocognitive neuroimaging assessment patient severely bothersome tinnitus . The investigator plan perform pilot study enroll total 10 subject undergo task-based imaging . These result compare control ( tinnitus ) cohort ( n=35 ) already undergone task-based fMRI . This task-based paradigm allow u advance knowledge role attention , control , cortical network development maintenance bothersome tinnitus . The investigator anticipate take one year successfully enroll test total 10 patient . All scan perform Washington University ground .</detailed_description>
