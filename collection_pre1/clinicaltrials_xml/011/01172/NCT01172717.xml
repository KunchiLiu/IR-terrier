	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis metastatic carcinoid tumor carcinoid syndrome Measurable disease define RECIST criterion evaluable disease 1 . Measurable disease presence least one measurable lesion . If measurable disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology/histology . Measurable lesion lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter great equal 20 mm use conventional technique great equal 10 mm spiral CT scan . 2 . Evaluable disease disease measure directly size tumor evaluate validated biomarker assay include 24 hr urine 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid , serum serotonin , and/or serum chromogranin A . 3 . All sit disease must evaluate less equal 28 day prior enrollment . All subject must 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 0 2 . Subjects may past may receive current treatment octreotide . Adequate laboratory parameter test perform within 72 hour prior first dose . 1 . Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1.5 x 109/L 2 . Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL 3 . Platelet count great equal 100 x 109/L 4 . Serum creatinine le 1.5 mg/dL 5 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 3 time upper limit normal , unless radiographic evidence liver metastasis . If liver metastasis , AST le 5 time upper limit normal . 6 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 3 time upper limit normal , unless radiographic evidence liver metastasis . If liver metastasis , AST le 5 time upper limit normal . 7 . Total Bilirubin le equal 1.5 time upper limit normal . 8 . Magnesium level great low limit normal Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform within 7 day prior start treatment Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Woman men use adequate birth control least 6 month last administration panitumumab . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . A sign informed consent must obtain prior study specific procedure . Evidence localize carcinoid tumor amenable surgical resection chemoembolization . People asymptomatic carcinoid tumor . Past treatment EGFR inhibitor include cetuximab panitumumab . History active malignancy require treatment past 5 year exception resect basal cell carcinoma skin .
