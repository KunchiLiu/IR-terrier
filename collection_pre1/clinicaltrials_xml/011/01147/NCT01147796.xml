	<detailed_description>Left atrial appendage ( LAA ) thrombus major cause cardiogenic embolism . It responsible high morbidity mortality translate significant modification patient management . Transoesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) consider gold standard method detection LAA thrombus semi-invasive investigation . TEE indeed perform use intravenous benzodiazepine sedation order optimize patient tolerance quality operator even general anesthesia . To date validate method assessment LAA thrombus . Multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) currently widely use assessment cardiac function geometry well coronary artery anatomy . Technologic improvement 64 slice CT , offer high temporal spatial resolution , new prospective gating , reduce drastically irradiation dose , make particularly attractive assessment LAA thrombus never evaluate indication . Furthermore , addition current arterial `` early '' acquisition time , second `` late '' acquisition ( 2 minute later ) may reduce false positive result . Aims study . The primary aim study evaluate accuracy 64 slice CT use prospective gating diagnosis LAA thrombus . The secondary objective define optimal acquisition time offer best diagnostic performance ( early , late ) . Design study . The present study preliminary MONOCENTER study TEE reference method 64 slice CT iodine injection prospective gating method ass . All patient hospitalize BICHAT hospital refer TEE clinically motivate search LAA thrombus potential candidate present study . To insure feasibility study rigorous methodology TEE perform patient prevalence LAA thrombus deliberately increase patient negative TEE ( thrombus ) CT perform randomize . Both TEE CT perform within 18 hour . All CT analysis centralize perform blinded clinical echocardiographic information end inclusion period study . We plan enroll 135 patient two year period . Clinical implication . Validation 64 slice compute tomography prospective gating may reduce TEE indication improve patient ' comfort .</detailed_description>
