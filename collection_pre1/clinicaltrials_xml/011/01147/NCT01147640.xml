Subject require surgical intervention ( e.g . laparotomy , laparoscopic surgery , percutaneous drain abscess ) within 24 hour ( ) first dose study drug If subject enrol preoperatively , subject must radiographic evidence bowel perforation intraabdominal abscess Subjects fail prior antibacterial treatment current cIAI enrol must : ( ) positive culture ( intraabdominal site ) ( b ) require surgical intervention . Such subject enrol result culture know ; however , culture negative , study drug administration must discontinue . Willing able comply study procedure restriction Willing able provide write informed consent Women pregnant , nursing , child bear potential use medically accept , effective method birth control ( e.g . condom , oral contraceptive , indwell intrauterine device , sexual abstinence ) Diagnosis abdominal wall abscess ; small bowel obstruction ischemic bowel disease without perforation ; traumatic bowel perforation surgery within 12 hour ; perforation gastroduodenal ulcer surgery within 24 hour ( consider situation peritoneal soil infection become establish ) ; another intraabdominal process primary etiology likely infectious . Simple cholecystitis , gangrenous cholecystitis without rupture , simple appendicitis , acute suppurative cholangitis , infect , necrotizing pancreatitis , pancreatic abscess cIAI manage staged abdominal repair ( STAR ) , open abdomen technique situation infection source control likely achieve Known prior randomization IAI postoperative infection cause pathogen ( ) resistant meropenem Considered unlikely survive 4 5week study period Any rapidlyprogressing disease immediately lifethreatening illness ( include acute hepatic failure , respiratory failure septic shock ) The need concomitant systemic antibacterial agent ( vancomycin linezolid ) addition study drug ( ) Moderate severe impairment renal function ( estimate CrCl &lt; 50 mL/min ) , requirement peritoneal dialysis , hemodialysis hemofiltration , oliguria ( &lt; 20 mL/h urine output 24 hour ) The presence hepatic disease define : ( ) ALT AST &gt; 4 x ULN ; ( b ) Total bilirubin &gt; 2 x ULN , unrelated cholecystitis ( c ) Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 4 x ULN .
