	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) immunodeficiency disease white blood cell unable kill certain bacteria fungi . People CGD likely develop recurrent life-threatening infection . Certain change mutation gene contribute severity CGD , also appear affect success treatment interferon-gamma , substance use improve immune system ability fight infection . Researchers interested studying change immune system cause interferon-gamma treatment CGD individual different mutation cause CGD . Objectives : - To compare change immune system cause interferon-gamma treatment CGD individual different mutation cause CGD . Eligibility : - Individuals age diagnose CGD specific type mutation cause CGD ( determined testing ) . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants must weigh 11 kilogram ( ~24 pound ) participate study . - Participants receive injection interferon-gamma weekly 4 week , twice weekly 4 week , three time weekly 4 week ( total 24 injection ) . - Blood drawn periodically treatment 8 week treatment , total 21 week study . Participants regularly provide information symptom responses treatment study researcher .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Biochemical Response Interferon-Gamma Subjects With Specific Gene Mutation Chronic Granulomatous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) cause mutation 1 4 protein comprise NADPH oxidase result decrease absent production superoxide phagocyte , predisposes CGD subject life-threatening infection . Intensive management antibiotic antifungal agent dramatically increase life expectancy subject CGD . Interferon-gamma ( IFN gamma ) , increase superoxide production neutrophil enhance antimicrobial activity , FDA approve therapy CGD standard care . However , substantial variability biochemical clinical response IFN gamma treatment . Recently , specific mutation gene responsible cause CGD subject follow NIH characterize . Because , know severity disease correlate inheritance pattern , also specific underlie mutation . It know , however , biochemical response IFN gamma therapy correlate specific mutation well . Since treatment IFN gamma expensive , require frequent injection , subject result systemic side effect , would useful determine whether biochemical response systemic side effect correlate underlying mutation GCD . We hypothesize subject X-linked CGD due nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion mutation gp91phox component NADPH oxidase generate small biochemical response IFN gamma therapy compare subject missense gp91phox mutation autosomal recessive form CGD result mutation p47phox p67phox component . The primary objective study assess predictability IFN_F responsiveness CGD base mutational analysis . compare change function NADPH oxidase treatment escalate dose IFN_ompasubjects CGD result missense nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion gp91phox mutation mutation p47phox p67phox . The secondary objective assess change superoxide production , expression NADPH oxidase component , neutrophil bactericidal capacity Staphyloccus aureus , cytokine , cell surface marker , antibody , lymphocyte subset , constitutional symptom , gene expression leukocytes subject missense gp91phox mutation , nonsense/frameshift/RNA processing/deletion gp91phox mutation , p47phox mutation , p67phox mutation treatment IFN_R ass change expression NADPH oxidase component , cytokine , cell surface marker , antibody production , production various lymphocyte subset , constitutional symptom gene expression leukocytes subject follow treatment IFNg . This knowledge assist physician determine subject likely respond full dose alternative dose therapy IFNg provide information biochemical response regimens subject specific CDG gene mutation enable well counsel manage subject CGD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects may enrol : 1 . Already enrol exist CGD protocol Clinical Center ( remain enrolled exist protocol ) ; 2 . Are include one study cohort list ; 3 . Male female ; 4 . Able comply selfadministration subcutaneous injection ; 5 . Willing blood sample store duration study future research . Study Groups/Cohorts : Xlinked CGD Nonsense/Frameshift/RNA Processing/Deletion Mutations Cohort : Subjects cohort must Xlinked CGD result document nonsense , frameshift , RNA processing , deletion gene mutation . Subjects gene defect specific genetic defect determine eligible inclusion cohort . Xlinked CGD Missense Mutation Low Baseline Superoxide Production ( less equal 2.5 nmol/10 ( 6 ) cells/hr ) Cohort : Subjects cohort must Xlinked CGD result document missense gene superoxide production cytochrome c reduction assay baseline less equal 2.5 nmol/10 ( 6 ) cells/hr . Subjects gene defect specific genetic defect determine eligible inclusion cohort . Xlinked CGD Missense Mutation Higher Baseline Superoxide Production ( great 2.5 nmol/10 ( 6 ) cells/hr ) Cohort : Subjects cohort must Xlinked CGD result document missense gene superoxide production cytochrome c reduction assay baseline great 2.5 nmol/10 ( 6 ) cells/hr . Subjects gene defect specific genetic defect determine eligible inclusion cohort . Autosomal Recessive p47phox CGD Cohort : Subjects cohort must autosomal recessive CGD result document p47phox gene mutation . Subjects gene defect specific genetic defect determine eligible inclusion cohort . Autosomal Recessive p67phox CGD Cohort : Subjects cohort must autosomal recessive CGD result document p67phox gene mutation . Subjects gene defect specific genetic defect determine eligible inclusion cohort . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude study : 1 . Have undergone successful bone marrow transplantation ; 2 . Had serious adverse reaction IFN gamma past ; 3 . Are pregnant breast feeding ; 4 . Weigh le 11 kg ; 5 . Are currently therapy INF gamma ; 6 . Have follow medical condition : Coronary artery disease ; Hepatic disease and/or liver enzymes elevate 3 time normal ; Seizure disorder , Severe myelosuppression ( absolute neutrophil count less than1000 cells/mm ( 3 ) ) . Participation Minors : minor patient invite participant study . Participation Women : Exposure IFN gamma develop human fetus may detrimental . For reason , woman childbearingage pregnancy test prior undergo study procedure . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , immediately inform study staff primary care physician . Pregnancy Lactation : The effect IFN gamma therapy develop fetus newborn infant study . Therefore , recommend subject pregnant breastfeed receive IFN gamma exclude study .</criteria>
