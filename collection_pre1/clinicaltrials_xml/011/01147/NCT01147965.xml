	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect ( good bad ) cancer vaccine cancer . The cancer vaccine call Ad5 [ E1- , E2b- ] -CEA ( 6D ) ETBX-011 make Etubics . This vaccine base virus call adenovirus change express protein CEA find cancer cell . Therefore , vaccine tell immune system attack cancer cell make CEA . The investigator try determine whether give virus safe whether cause strong immune system attack cancer . ETBX-011 investigational drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Active Immunotherapy CEA Vaccine Patients With Malignancies Expressing CEA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II study primary purpose determine safety immunization Ad5 [ E1- , E2B- ] -CEA ( 6D ) , patient advance metastatic CEA-expressing malignancy . The secondary objective evaluate CEA-specific immune response immunization obtain preliminary data clinical response rate . The study population consist patient histologically confirm diagnosis metastatic malignancy CEA positive previously treat standard therapy know possible survival benefit refuse therapy . The study determine safety three dosage level Ad5 [ E1- , E2B- ] -CEA ( 6D ) vaccine ( phase I component ) , maximally tolerate dose Ad5 [ E1- , E2B- ] -CEA ( 6D ) vaccine ( phase II component ) . The study drug Ad5 [ E1- , E2B- ] -CEA ( 6D ) give subcutaneous ( SQ ) injection every 3 week 3 immunization . We evaluate safety cohort least 3 week last patient previous cohort receive first injection . A dose scheme consider safe &lt; 33 % patient treated dosage level experience DLT ( e.g. , 0 3 , ≤1 6 , ≤3 12 ≤5 18 patient ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria Patient Eligibility 1 . Histologically confirm diagnosis malignancy express CEA . Because safety immunogenicity study , patient NOT require measurable evaluable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . 2 . For tumor type colorectal , tumor must express CEA define immunohistochemical staining ( least 50 % tumor least moderate intensity stain ) tumor know universally CEA positive ( i.e . colon rectal cancer ) . If colorectal cancer , pathologic clinical confirmation adenocarcinoma require . 3 . Patients must receive treatment standard therapy know possible overall survival benefit . For follow common cancer , follow eligibility criterion apply : Colorectal cancer : Must receive progress least one line palliative chemotherapy consist one follow regimen : Palliative chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer 5 fluorouracil ( capecitabine ) oxaliplatin . Palliative chemotherapy metastatic colorectal cancer 5 fluorouracil ( capecitabine ) irinotecan . Palliative chemotherapy regimen metastatic colorectal cancer include bevacizumab . Colorectal cancer patient currently receive palliative singleagent bevacizumab cetuximab eligible trial may continue therapy concomitant study treatment ( single agent therapy least 3 month ) . Breast cancer : Must receive progress least one line chemotherapy metastatic breast cancer consist one follow regimen : Palliative anthracycline taxanebased chemotherapy Patients tumor express HER2 ( IHC 3+ FISH+ ) must receive progress least one line palliative therapy combine trastuzumab chemotherapy . Breast cancer patient currently receive palliative endocrine therapy singleagent trastuzumab eligible trial may continue therapy concomitant study treatment ( single agent therapy least 3 month ) . Patients treat offer option treatment Bevacizumab ( option clearly state consent form ) . Patients treat offer option treatment Lapatinib ( option clearly state consent form ) . Lung cancer : Must receive progressed chemotherapy metastatic disease consist one follow regimen : Palliative platinumbased ( cisplatin carboplatin ) chemotherapy patient receive chemotherapy previously . Palliative taxanebased ( docetaxel paclitaxel ) vinorelbine chemotherapy patient receive chemotherapy previously . Lung cancer patient currently receive palliative singleagent erlotinib gefitinib eligible trial may continue therapy concomitant study treatment ( single agent therapy least 3 month ) . Pancreatic cancer : Must receive progressed chemotherapy include gemcitabine . Pancreatic cancer patient currently receive palliative singleagent erlotinib eligible trial may continue therapy concomitant study treatment ( single agent therapy least 3 month ) . For malignancy , first line therapy survival palliative benefit exists , administer progressive disease . Patients receive progressed firstline palliative chemotherapy must advise regard secondline therapy enrol investigational study . 4 . Karnofsky performance score 70 % high 5 . Estimated life expectancy &gt; 3 month 6 . Age ≥ 21 year , &lt; 75 7 . Adequate hematologic function , WBC ≥ 3000/microliter , hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ( acceptable prior transfusion ) , platelets ≥ 75,000/microliter ; PTINR &lt; 1.5 , PTT &lt; 1.5X ULN 8 . Adequate renal hepatic function , serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL , bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL ( except Gilbert 's syndrome allow bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ) , ALT AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal . 9 . Patients receive prior CEAtargeted immunotherapy eligible trial , treatment discontinue least 3 month prior enrollment . 10 . Patients take medication know history immunosuppression eligible trial . 11 . Ability understand provide sign informed consent fulfills Institutional Review Board 's guideline . 12 . Ability return clinical site adequate followup , require protocol . Criteria Patient Exclusion 1 . Patients concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy exclude . There exclusion base number prior chemotherapy , biologic , hormonal , experimental regimen . Except permitted concomitant therapy ( bevacizumab , cetuximab , trastuzumab , erlotinib , gefitinib , hormonal therapy patient must least 3 month time enrollment intend continue vaccine ) , must least 3 month prior CEAtargeted immunotherapy study treatment least 4 week prior therapy ( include radiotherapy ) study treatment . Patients must recover grade 1 acute toxicity prior treatment . 2 . Patients history current brain metastasis permit . 3 . Patients history autoimmune disease , restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Autoimmune related thyroid disease vitiligo permit . 4 . Patients serious intercurrent chronic acute illness , cardiac disease ( NYHA class III IV ) , hepatic disease , illness consider Principal Investigator unwarranted high risk investigational drug treatment . 5 . Patients medical psychological impediment probable compliance protocol exclude . 6 . Concurrent ( within last 5 year ) second malignancy non melanoma skin cancer , cervical carcinoma situ , control superficial bladder cancer , carcinoma situ treat . 7 . Presence active acute chronic infection include : urinary tract infection , HIV ( determine ELISA confirm Western Blot ) . Patients HIV exclude base immunosuppression , may render unable respond vaccine ; patient chronic hepatitis exclude concern hepatitis could exacerbate injection . 8 . Patients steroid therapy ( immunosuppressive , azathioprine cyclosporin A ) exclude basis potential immune suppression . Patients must 6 week discontinuation steroid therapy ( except use premedication chemotherapy contrastenhanced study ) prior enrollment . 9 . Pregnant nursing woman exclude protocol since research may unknown harmful effect unborn child young child . If patient sexually active , patient must agree use medically acceptable form birth control receive treatment period 4 month follow last vaccination therapy . It know whether treatment use study could affect sperm could potentially harm child may father study . 10 . Patients acute chronic skin disorder interfere injection skin extremity subsequent assessment potential skin reaction exclude . 11 . Patients allow warfarin 1mg po qd port prophylaxis . 12 . Patients metastatic disease determine resectable exclude .</criteria>
