	<brief_summary>Creatine supplementation RTT : randomize control trial Rett Syndrome ( RTT ) neurodevelopmental disorder characterise apparently normal early development ( stage 1 RTT ) follow loss purposeful hand use , distinctive hand stereotype , slow brain growth , loss language , respiratory irregularity , gastrointestinal disturbance , gait abnormality , seizure , mental retardation . These symptom typically appear 6 18 month age ( stage 2 ) . Subsequently , gradual stabilisation severe mental retardation motor compromise ( stage 3 ) . The majority ( 70 % 80 % ) patient show mutation methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 ( MeCP2 ) gene , locate chromosome Xq28 . MeCP2 encode transcription repressor protein ubiquitously express tissue . As RTT primarily affect female , male mutation MeCP2 identify . Mutations MeCP2 also identify child X-linked mental retardation , autism clinical phenotype resembles Angelman Syndrome . The aim study investigate effect dietary supplement biochemical clinical parameter RTT . About 80 % labile methyl group generate re-methylation cycle use synthesis creatine within human organism . Supplementation creatine therefore increase availability labile methyl group different methylation reaction include methylation DNA . The study double blind cross-over . The patient get creatine monophosphate ( 200 mg/kg/d three dosage per day ) placebo . After 6 month wash-out period 4 week group change next 6 month . All participant RTT mutation MeCP2 undergo physical neurological exam , quantitative EEG , behavioral assessment , laboratory testing , neuropsychological evaluation . Participants follow-up 3 , 6 , 10 , 13 16 month ( 3 month finish study ) , include similar assessment .</brief_summary>
