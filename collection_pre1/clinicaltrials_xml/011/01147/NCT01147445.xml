	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn new candidate vaccine ( dmLT ) ETEC ( E. coli infection ) safe . This vaccine test see effect body ability vaccine help body resist disease . Researchers want find high dose dmLT vaccine give without cause severe side effect . Most E. coli bacteria harmless human even beneficial . However , harmful , cause diarrhea . About 32 healthy adult , age 18-45 , participate study . This study require volunteer stay research facility several night . Participants assign receive 1 4 vaccine dos mouth . Study procedures include : stool sample , blood sample , document side effect . Participants involve study related procedure 8 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study ETEC Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite public health burden enterotoxigenic Escherichia ( E. ) coli ( ETEC ) traveler , deploy soldier , significantly , young child develop world , licensed vaccine ETEC enteritis . The rationale use E. coli heat labile enterotoxin ( LT ) ( R192G/L211A ) vaccine , also call double-mutant LT ( dmLT ) , expect especially well tolerated subject . If dmLT safe immunogenic , may become anti-toxin vaccine component ETEC vaccine candidate , well adjuvant mucosal immunization . This phase I dose escalation study , 4 cohort 6 subject enrol receive 5 microgram ( mcg ) , 25 mcg , 50 mcg , 100 mcg dmLT vaccine , plus fifth cohort 12 subject randomize double-blinded receive either 50 mcg 100 mcg dmLT vaccine . A Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) convene study , review available safety data Day 8 visit cohort prior make recommendation Sponsor whether proceed next cohort . If dose well tolerate determine SMC review safety data , Confirmation Cohort 8 subject enrol administer previous dose . The first two cohort enrol simultaneously , dose investigational product , observed ensure tolerability Day 8 5 mcg 25 mcg dose level . The first two cohort dose simultaneously base excellent safety record dose single mutant LT ( LTR192G ) . Thereafter , dose escalation subject enrollment proceed step-wise fashion . Safety assess solicited symptoms/subject memory aid laboratory evaluation . Adverse event ( AE ) grade accord standardize criterion . The immunogenicity outcome measure interest rate titer seroconversion serum fecal immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) anti-LT antibody measure ELISA stimulation anti-LT antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) . The sample size chosen base exploratory nature test article study previously give human . Participants include 36 healthy adult male female subject , age 18 45 inclusive . The primary objective study assess safety dmLT vaccine administer single oral dose range dose level healthy adult subject . The primary objective Cohort 5 evaluate safety immunogenicity 50 µg 100 µg dos orally administer dmLT vaccine healthy adult subject . The secondary objective assess long-term safety follow-up immunization Month 6 post vaccination evaluate immunogenicity single oral dose dmLT vaccine range dose healthy adult subject .</detailed_description>
