	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine benefit physical activity breast cancer survivor related muscle strength , tiredness , sleep quality . Also , study determine potential role inflammation benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Activity , Fatigue , Sleep , Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous research show increase physical activity improve health well-being breast cancer survivor . The current study determine whether physical activity increase adequate improve health measure physical activity ( accelerometer self-report ) , muscle strength , fatigue , sleep . Moreover , study examine cytokine change cancer survivor participation physical activity behavior change intervention mechanistic focus cytokine may influence muscle strength , fatigue , sleep response intervention . Seventy-four female , breast cancer survivor recruit within 50-miles radius Springfield , IL . Participants study approximately 5 month . Participants ask complete questionnaire begin study 3 month later . A blood sample drawn determine serum cytokine level . Volunteers randomly assign 1 2 study group . The intervention group participate 3 month physical activity intervention involve moderate intensity walk strength training resistance band . This randomize controlled trial include follow study aim : Study aim 1 : The intervention group compare control group examine change physical activity , muscle strength , fatigue , sleep dysfunction participation physical activity intervention . Study aim 2 : To investigate mechanism may underlie effect physical activity intervention muscle strength , fatigue , sleep , compare intervention group control group term change cytokine marker inflammation evaluate whether change consistent may mediate change muscle strength , fatigue , sleep dysfunction .</detailed_description>
