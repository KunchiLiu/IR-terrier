	<brief_title>Immune Response Following Treatment Resectable Renal Cell Carcinoma Intermediate Risk Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicenter , randomize , single-blind study ass patient ' immune response follow treatment HSPPC-96 ( vitespen , OncophageÂ® ) resectable renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , consider intermediate risk recurrence give pathologic tumor stage time resection . The purpose study determine whether patient exhibit measurable durable immune response multiple administration HSPPC-96 maximum 15-month time period . The study consist two part : Part 1 Part 1a ( Assessment Immune Variation ) Part 1b ( Assay Standardization ) , Part 2 ( Immune Monitoring Study ) . The study terminate early 12 patient enrol Part 1a Part 1b . Part 2 study involve randomization 8 dose HSSPC-96 . After 8 dos HSSPC-96 administer Part 2 , patient randomize Treatment Extension Arm Placebo Extension Arm . There patient enrol Part 2 since study terminate early . Therefore , randomization occur conduct study single arm enrol .</detailed_description>
