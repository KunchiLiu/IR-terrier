	<brief_title>Flail Chest - Rib Fixation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chest trauma frequent multiply-injured patient directly responsible 20-25 % trauma death . Additionally , chest trauma major contributory factor another 25 % deaths trauma . Besides short term mortality , injuries chest result significant morbidity cost care long term disability . Among patient sustain chest trauma , flail chest one serious injury . Patients require prolonged ventilation , ICU hospital stay high incidence pulmonary infection . Survivors often go significant impairment pulmonary function half may never return gainful employment . The standard therapy injury chest wall , include flail chest effective analgesia , pulmonary toilet postural drainage aggressive chest physical therapy . Despite measure , flail chest patient often well . Early operative fixation ( surgical anchor brace bone ) stabilize chest wall restore pulmonary dynamic always attractive option . With improvement patient selection , availability good modern anesthesia critical care , mechanical fixation device , small study several case report testify feasibility concept possible short long term benefit . All one small institutional study retrospective nature limit generalizability conclusion . In small single institutional prospective trial patient flail chest randomize either early operative fixation standard non-operative therapy , patient randomize early operative fixation show significant improvement short- long-term health outcome result low in-hospital cost surgically treat group . Despite impressive result , although prospective , one study small number patient single institution . The question benefit operative fixation conclusively answer large multi-institutional prospective randomize study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adults &gt; 21 year &lt; 75 year 2 . `` Stovein chest '' encompass 1 . Unilateral flail chest ( &gt; 3 rib fracture two place ) 2 . Contiguous rib fracture least 2 rib push &gt; rib diameter push rib 3 . Mechanically ventilate 1 . Patient unlikely survive due trauma age multiple comorbidities 2 . Stovein chest patient require early ( less equal 48 hour injury ) ventilatory support 3 . Bilateral flail chest 4 . Sternal flail 5 . P/F ratio &lt; 200:1 period great equal 6 hour ventilator . 6 . Other injury likely prolong tracheal intubation mechanical ventilation eg significant head injury result low GCS ( Glasgow Coma Score , scale use assess central nervous system patient undergone trauma ) , spinal cord injury result paralysis respiratory muscle etc . These merely examples . It opinion investigator/surgeon injury would prolong tracheal intubation . 7 . Any contraindication surgery include severe immunosuppression severe chronic disease make elective surgery dangerous opinion surgeon 8 . Inability proceed aspect critical care due personal belief , live etc eg non acceptance blood product 9 . Inability obtain informed consent . 10 . Subject 's refusal follow 11 . Pregnant woman 12 . Prisoners 13 . Any reason potential subject good candidate , opinion investigator . If site investigator believe patient good candidate study ( i.e . require ventilation primarily due alter chest wall mechanic ) fail meet criterion , site may contact Dr Ajai Malhotra see waiver grant .</criteria>
