	<brief_title>Study Elacytarabine Versus Investigator 's Choice Patients With Late Stage Acute Myeloid Leukaemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study investigate new nucleoside analogue derivative , elacytarabine , treatment patient relapse refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) . To include study , patient must fail respond two three different therapy AML , obtain remission relapse within relatively short period time . Patients age ≥ 65 adverse cytogenetics include study receive one three previous induction/re-induction therapy . Elacytarabine investigational drug commercially available . It elaidic acid ester derivative cytarabine . Cytarabine routinely use treatment patient AML . A substantial portion AML patient deficient uptake cytarabine , often explain lack transport protein ( hENT1 ) leukemic cell membrane . Due elaidic acid ( naturally occur fatty acid ) , cellular uptake elacytarabine independent transport protein . Patients include study randomize elacytarabine control treatment . Since standard therapy relapse refractory AML , list 7 control treatment investigator choose one lock randomization . Elacytarabine give continuous infusion five day , follow rest period minimum two week . Investigator 's choice treatment give accord specific routine . After course response evaluation decision treatment make . Repeated course elacytarabine control treatment might need attain and/or maintain complete remission clinical benefit . After end study treatment , patient follow relapse survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year age old Confirmed diagnosis AML accord WHO classification ( exclude acute promyelocytic leukaemia ) receive two three previous induction/reinduction regimens patient age ≥ 65 adverse cytogenetics receive 13 previous induction/reinduction regimen . One ( ) induction regimen could stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) achievement remission . Maintenance consolidation ( include SCT ) may give , count previous regimen . Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy must contain &gt; 5 % leukaemic blast cell patient must biopsyproven extramedullary AML , patient 's peripheral blood show occurrence leukaemic blast cell Patients must never attain CR CRi ( primary refractory ) , fail initial induction therapy , attain CR CRi salvage therapy ( y ) , relapse within &lt; 6 month , attain CR CRi initial induction therapy relapse within &lt; 12 month , fail respond salvage therapy ( y ) , relapse late CR CRi within &lt; 6 month Patients young 65 year receive previous treatment cytarabine Patients must recover previous bone marrow and/or stem cell transplantation stage patient tolerate study treatment . There restriction number regimens type treatment administer maintenance consolidation previous stage disease ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 2 Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior treatment start Male female patient must use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study , male also 3 month last elacytarabine dose Capable understanding comply protocol requirement , must able willing sign write informed consent form A history allergic reaction egg . A history allergic reaction CTCAE grade 3 4 cytarabine Persistent clinically significant toxicity previous chemotherapy A cancer history , accord investigator , might confound assessment study endpoint Known positive status human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Pregnant nursing patient Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled infection , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Impairment hepatic renal function extent patient , opinion investigator , expose excessive risk enter clinical study Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within previous 3 month , symptomatic coronary artery disease , arrhythmias control medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure . Any New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification grade 3 4 Applicable patient anthracycline part select control treatment : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) must ≥ 45 % measure MUGA scan 2D ECHO within 14 day prior start therapy . Either method acceptable measure LVEF Applicable patient anthracycline part select control treatment : The patient tolerate minimum one course combination therapy Any antileukaemic agent within last 3 week . Hydroxyurea , however , allow 12 hour prior study treatment Any investigational treatment within last 14 day Any medical condition opinion investigator place patient unacceptably high risk toxicity</criteria>
