	<brief_summary>A Phase I/II clinical trial use fractionate dose regimen 90Y-epratuzumab ( anti-CD22 ) show encouraging response follicular aggressive NHL ability administer safely 2 injection 20 mCi/m2 space 1 week apart . The investigator propose combine active 90Y-epratuzumab treatment regimen veltuzumab also find active Phase I/II trial . The goal study determine safety efficacy 90Y-epratuzumab used combination veltuzumab . The primary objective determine response rate combination treatment . Secondary objective assess safety , pharmacokinetics target 90Y-epratuzumab . Veltuzumab blood level anti-antibody response also monitor various time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Veltuzumab Fractionated 90Y- Epratuzumab Radioimmunotherapy Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment regimen consist 2 element . The first element represent one course veltuzumab ( 4 weekly injection 200 mg/m2 ) . 90Y-epratuzumab give 2 injection escalate dos 1 week apart administer start one week follow 4th veltuzumab injection . After confirm eligibility undergoing baseline assessment , treatment start image study use 111In-epratuzumab ( 5-mCi 111In-DOTA-epratuzumab co-infused total 1.5 mg/kg unlabeled epratuzumab ) . Blood sample ( ~7 sample , 5 mL ) pharmacokinetic analysis collect 5-7 day , patient image 4 separate occasion ( e.g. , day injection ( Day 0 ) , Day 1 , Day 3 , 4 , 5 , day 6 7 ) . The patient initiate veltuzumab treatment start 7 day 111In-epratuzumab injection . Veltuzumab give 4 weekly dos , 200 mg/m2 . A single blood sample take veltuzumab dose assess residual veltuzumab concentration serum , 1 h later determine peak value . Patients receive unlabeled , unconjugated epratuzumab ( 1.5 mg/kg ) infuse ~30 minute . Patients also receive 111In-epratuzumab immediately follow unlabeled epratuzumab . Blood sample collect interval first 111In-epratuzumab . Only 2 imaging session require , Day 1 day 6 7 ( day match obtain first 111In-epratuzumab injection ) . The 90Y-epratuzumab treatment begin one week 4th veltuzumab injection . Patients receive unlabeled , unconjugated epratuzumab ( 1.5 mg/kg ) infuse ~30 minute . All patient receive 90Y-epratuzumab dose . Dose escalate patient cohort start 2x15 mCi/m2 , 2x 20 mCi/m2 , 2x 25 mCi/m2.. Blood sample collect interval 111In-epratuzumab.Patients also receive 111In-epratuzumab immediately follow unlabeled epratuzumab immediately 90Y-epratuzumab injection . Blood sample collect interval first 111In-epratuzumab . Only 2 imaging session require , Day 1 day 6 7 ( day match obtain first 111In-epratuzumab injection ) . The second 90Y-epratuzumab treatment give dose , 1 week first 90Y-epratuzumab dose . CBC check prior administration second dose ensure blood count continue meet criterion treatment specify inclusion criterion . Blood sample collect period first injection , image study require . Patients closely monitored infusion , interval 12-weeks post-treatment evaluation period , evaluation procedure include vital sign , physical examination , CT ( chest , abdomen , pelvis , region involvement ) , CBC , serum chemistry , serum immunoglobulin , urinalysis , peripheral blood B-cell level ( immunophenotyping base CD19 ) , serum sample HAHA ( veltuzumab epratuzumab ELISA analyze Immunomedics ) . Follow-up evaluation continue every 3 month 5 year progression occur resolution treatment-related toxicity .</detailed_description>
