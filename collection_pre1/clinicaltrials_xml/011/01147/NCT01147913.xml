Recent research suggest bias may modify use computerized program provide repeated exposure positive interpretation salient , ambiguous situation , goal interpret ambiguity less negatively . These modification program efficacious alter interpretation bias reduce anxiety adult social specific phobia . Therefore , propose study aim examine efficacy adapt interpretation bias modification program depress adolescent . Specifically , study examine efficacy four session modification program alter interpretation bias reduce symptom depression , anxiety , negative affect . A total 60 adolescent ( age 14-21 ) symptom major depression randomly assign either active intervention condition ( four session modification program two week ) attention control condition . Measures include diagnostic interview , self-report measure depression , anxiety , negative affect , test interpretation bias response ambiguous situation . It hypothesize : 1 ) Compared adolescent attention control condition , adolescent receive four session positive interpretive training experience significantly large decrease baseline post-treatment negative interpretation bias ( e.g. , positive few negative interpretation ambiguous situation ) measure interpretation bias ; , 2 ) Compared adolescent attention control condition , adolescent receive positive interpretation training experience significantly large decrease baseline post-treatment self-reported state depression , anxiety , negative affect .</detailed_description>
