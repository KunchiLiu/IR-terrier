	<detailed_description>All currently license influenza vaccine United States produce embryonated hen 's egg . There several well-recognized disadvantage use eggs substrate influenza vaccine . Eggs require specialized manufacturing facility could difficult scale rapidly response emerge need pandemic . It usually necessary adapt candidate vaccine viruses high-yield growth egg , process time consuming , always successful , select receptor variant may suboptimal immunogenicity . In addition , agricultural disease affect chicken flock , might important issue pandemic due avian influenza virus strain , could easily disrupt supply egg vaccine manufacturing . Therefore , development alternative substrate influenza vaccine production identify high-priority objective . One potential alternative method production influenza vaccine expression influenza virus hemagglutinin ( HA ) use recombinant DNA technique . This alternative avoids dependence egg efficient high level protein expression control baculovirus polyhedrin promoter .</detailed_description>
