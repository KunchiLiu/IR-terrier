	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Study JNJ-26489112 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>26489112 drug test see may useful number indication include major depression . This study compare effect 26489112 administer healthy volunteer alone combination mixture 3 drug consist midazolam ( drug use reduce anxiety produce drowsiness anesthesia certain medical procedure surgery ) , omeprazole ( drug use treat symptom gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) condition cause excess stomach acid ) , tolbutamide ( drug use treat type 2 diabetes mellitus patient blood sugar control diet exercise alone ) . Approximately 20 healthy adult volunteer enrol treated study drug 22 day . Volunteers require stay overnight study center receive study treatment 4 night begin study 4 night towards end study . On occasion , volunteer make daily visit study center receive treatment study drug . Participants take combination 3 drug ( omeprazole 20 mg capsule , tolbutamide 500 mg tablet , midazolam 2mg/mL liquid ) orally ( mouth ) 2 tablet study drug ( 2648911 ) orally 1 cup water . Blood sample collect study participant protocol-specified time study determine concentration 4 drug ( 26489112 , midazolam , omeprazole , tolbutamide ) present plasma ( colorless fluid portion blood ) . In addition , blood sample obtain enrolled patient study drug administration pharmacogenomics research ( research help identify genetic marker response , explain variability data , address emerge clinical issue ) . The primary outcome measure concentration midazolam , omeprazole , tolbutamide , 26489112 plasma measure protocol-specified pharmacokinetic parameter protocol-specified time point Days 1-4 Dasy 19-22 . Safety monitor study . Healthy volunteer receive study drug ( 26489112 ) orally ( mouth ) morning Day 4 Day 21 .</detailed_description>
