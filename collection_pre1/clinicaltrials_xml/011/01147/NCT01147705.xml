	<brief_summary>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) common condition arises due build atheroma artery supply blood peripheral muscle tissue . This imbalance oxygen supply demand become particularly apparent patient condition walk . The pain weakness experience ( mainly calf less commonly thigh ) know intermittent claudication resolve upon cessation exercise . It important disease study ( ) common ( est . prevalence symptomatic intermittent claudication Scotland 4.5 % ) ( ii ) 1.6 time higher relative risk ischaemic heart disease . These patient also significantly high mortality age-matched control around 12 % per year . There two main aim therapy - ( ) reduce risk cardiovascular event way standard secondary prevention measure ( smoke cessation , anti-platelet , anti-hypertensive cholesterol-lowering therapy , diabetic control ) ( ii ) treat symptom . Supervised exercise therapy show beneficial improve walking time distance select patient leg pain intermittent claudication overall increase walk distance approximately 150 metre three month . There numerous drug treatment available consideration PAD patient ( mainly cilostazol UK ) , many either undesirable side effect clear evidence benefit . The range increase walk distance cilostazol report 50-76 % increase three month compare 20 % placebo significant improvement Quality Life ( QOL ) indicator , although significant number adverse effect ( 16 % vs 8 % placebo ) limit therapy . The current cost ( March 2010 ) Â£35.31/month . Other option therapy include angioplasty bypass surgery . At present recommend patient fail respond medical therapy severely disable symptom ( absence significant exercise-limiting comorbidities ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit 50 patient peripheral arterial disease randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled parallel group study see allopurinol prolongs time leg pain maximum walking distance assess treadmill test six minute walk test . Recruitment take place Dundee , i.e . single-centre trial . Treatment last 24 week . Participants recruit current past attendee vascular laboratory intermittent claudication clinic outpatient clinic Ninewells . Participants allow continue usual medication throughout . After two baseline treadmill test , randomise either allopurinol placebo parallel group study double blind fashion . Each participant on-study 24 week ( standard time PAD medical intervention trial ) . The ultimate dose allopurinol 300 mg BD , dose know work angina . However , safety purpose , initial dose 100 mg/day two week , rise 300 mg/day four week , follow 600 mg/day next 18 week . Participants blood ( UE , LFT , FBC ) monitor week 0 , 6 , 18 24 week medication stop reduce dose concern arise . If study drug dose reduce , stay study . If study drug need stop , stay study order `` intention treat '' analysis . Double blind medication ( allopurinol placebo ) prepare package Tayside Pharmaceuticals . The medication come label `` Participant 1 '' , `` Participant 2 '' , etc . distribute participant research fellow accord sequence number . The blinded treatment code keep Clinical Trials Pharmacy Department , Ninewells , operate 24 hour emergency unblinding facility ( necessary ) seal envelope lock fireproof cabinet accessible responsible member University Dundee staff directly involve study . The following programme visit involve study ( list take participant information sheet ) - - Visit 1 ( week 0 ) - screen visit 1 - Consent - answer outstanding question may complete consent form . - Measurement blood pressure arm legs - Treadmill test - Blood sample - Visit 2 ( week 0 ) - screen visit 2 - Treadmill test - stable similar previous test able continue study - Six minute walk test - Measurement blood vessel 'stiffness ' - Supply initial study medication along instruction . - Two questionnaire - Walking Impairment Quality Life - Visit 3 ( week 6 ) - progress visit - Check medication - Blood sample - Supply study medication remainder study - Visit 4 ( week 12 ) - progress visit - Treadmill test - Six minute walk test - Check medication - Two questionnaire - Walking Impairment Quality Life - Visit 5 ( week 18 ) - progress visit - Measurement blood vessel 'stiffness ' - Check medication - Blood sample - Visit 6 ( week 24 ) - final visit - Measurement blood vessel 'stiffness ' - Treadmill test - Six minute walk test - Measurement blood pressure arm legs - Check medication - Blood sample - Two questionnaire - Walking Impairment Quality Life</detailed_description>
