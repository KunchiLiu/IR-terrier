	<brief_summary>Clinically Characterized presence chronic widespread pan tenderness , Fibromyalgia ( FM ) one common `` functional '' syndrome . FM currently conceive represent prototype central pain , i.e . condition sensitization central nervous system result overall increase processing painful stimulus , well impairment pain inhibition . This condition responsible significant social economic burden estimate affect 5 % woman . The 1990 American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) classification criterion FM current standard study FM , require presence widespread pain last 3 month , well documentation tenderness least 11 18 pre-defined `` tender point . Multiple additional symptom , part classification criterion , include among others sleep disturbance , mood disturbance , cognitive dysfunction , vulvodynia , dysmenorrhea , sexual dysfunction weight fluctuation . In addition , FM well know overlap clinically epidemiologically ever increase number `` functional '' disorder , include irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , Temporomandibular joint disorder ( TMJD ) , functional dyspepsia etc . In addition central symptom pain , FM patient frequently complain non- specific symptom potentially autonomically - mediate . Thus , palpitation , fatigue inability stand long period time common complaint . About 80-90 percent FM patient one symptom associate autonomic dysfunction . The common presyncope ( 62.5 % ) , follow syncope ( 12.5 % ) , palpitation stand ( 12.5 % ) dizziness ( 12.5 % ) ( 14 ) . Some symptom overlap postural tachycardia syndrome ( POTS ) . POTS common dysautonomia , characterize remarkable increased heart rate assumption upright posture ( &gt; 30 bpm ) . According experience , FM find , least , 15 % POTS patient . But , data exists incidence POTS patient FM.The role autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) initiate maintain syndrome FM study ( debate ) last decade . The ANS extremely complex system , regulate involuntary body function , include heart rate , intestinal motility , urination , sexual activity , among many variable . Notably , vagus inhibitory effect pain . Deterioration vagal control `` associate '' increase pain sensation . Previous study indicate FM patient may increase sympathetic control cardiovascular system reciprocal decrease parasympathetic control . High sympathetic tone usually associate low threshold pain . But , contribution ANS pathogenesis FM syndrome remain unclear . Evidently , ANS interact component CNS pathogenesis FM , include pain processing center thalamus amygdala , well hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis .</brief_summary>
