	<brief_title>Effectiveness Automated Locomotor Training Patients With Acute Incomplete Spinal Cord Injury : A Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About half patient experience traumatic spinal cord injury ( SCI ) still motor and/or sensory function level lesion . A large proportion patient become ambulatory within first six month SCI . In order optimally train walk function patient partially unloaded body weight walk move treadmill . In severe case therapist assist leg movement exhaustive work limit training time . In last year robotic device develop enable longer training time . Studies evaluate training patient hemiparesis show longer training time associate well outcome . The present study aim evaluate effect training time within robotic device recovery ambulatory function . Subject acute incomplete SCI include . The intervention consist walk train last least 50min , train control group last maximum 25min . Both group undergo 3-5 training per week . Group assignment perform random . The study last 8 week . The primary outcome self select walk speed assess bi-weekly training period 4 month later .</detailed_description>
