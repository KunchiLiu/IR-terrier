	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Neoadjuvant chemotherapy woman stage II-III Her negative breast cancer follow Her2Bi arm activated T cell ( ATCs ) may significantly improve pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate time surgery . Arming ex vivo expand T cell laboratory may help T cell kill tumor cell put back body . Giving combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow laboratory-treated T cell surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II clinical trial study well give laboratory-treated T cell neoadjuvant chemotherapy work treat woman stage II stage III breast cancer undergo surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted T Cells After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Treating Women With Stage II III Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) woman stage II-III triple-negative breast cancer without complete pathologic response ( cPR ) receive regimen neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( chemoT ) , surgery , and/or irradiation follow 8 infusion ~10-15 x 10^9 Her2Bi-armed activate T cell ( ATC ) ( aATC ) give twice per week 4 week combination IL-2 ( aldesleukin ) ( 300,000 IU/m^2/day ) GM-CSF ( sargramostim ) ( 250 μg/m^2/twice per week ) begin 3 day 1st infusion end 1 week last infusion ( defined immunotherapy ) . II . To estimate change baseline ( pre immunotherapy [ IT ] ) post-IT specific cytotoxicity interferon gamma ( IFN-γ ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( Elispots ) lymphocytes blood direct breast cancer cell . III . To investigate pathologic response change number proportion infiltrate cell cancer stem cell tumor time surgery associate progressive disease . OUTLINE : NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive dose-dense AC-T regimen comprise doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) cyclophosphamide IV every 2 week 4 course follow paclitaxel IV every 2 week 4 course paclitaxel IV weekly 12 week . Or , patient receive TAC regimen comprise docetaxel IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , cyclophosphamide IV every 3 week 6 course . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . IMMUNOTHERAPY : Beginning 3 week last dose chemotherapy , patient receive Her2Bi-armed activate T cell IV 5-30 minute twice weekly 4 week . Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) daily begin 3 day first T cell infusion end 1 week last infusion . SURGERY : Patients undergo surgical resection breast 2 week later . After completion study treatment , patient may follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
