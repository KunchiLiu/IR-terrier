	<brief_title>GSAO Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine maximum-tolerated dose recommend phase II dose angiogenesis inhibitor GSAO patient advance , refractory solid tumor . - To assess safety toxicity profile dose-limiting toxicity drug patient . Secondary - To determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - To determine pharmacodynamics drug patient . - To determine possible anti-tumor activity patient treatment drug . Tertiary - To determine pharmacodynamics drug patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive angiogenesis inhibitor GSAO IV 1 hour day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients show clinical benefit ( i.e. , stable disease , partial response , complete response ) may receive 6 additional course treatment . Patients receive angiogenesis inhibitor GSAO IV 1 hour day -7 obtain pharmacokinetics information single IV dose drug . Patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) prior , , study determine blood flow parameter . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , biomarker study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day month thereafter .
