	<brief_summary>Lung cancer responsible death due cancer year men woman worldwide diagnose , 10 year survival rate poor ( &lt; 15 % ) . This poor prognosis base large part absence effective diagnostic test disease . The chief objective study develop molecular-based diagnostic test specific lung cancer . Subjects suspect diagnosed lung cancer , either undergoing thoracentesis , biopsy suspicious lesion surgical resection tumor ask participate study . Those subject , undergo surgical resection , donate lung tumor tissue adjacent normal lung tissue ( potentially include lymph node ) , non-surgical candidate donate portion excess biopsy sample , available , diagnosis confirm . Subjects undergoing thoracentesis pleural effusion donate portion fluid sample , fluid volume collect excess need clinical care purpose . Blood sample optionally saliva also collect subject , whether undergo surgery . In addition biosample collection , detail annotate demographic clinical information collect subject . Subjects follow outcome analysis , specifically tumor recurrence , every 6 month , 5 year . In case change chemotherapy treatment , biosamples clinical information also collect . Collected biosamples analyze use series molecular proteomic technology develop biomarkers disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biomarker Discovery Validation Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study discover validate molecular biomarkers lung cancer . Lung cancer remain leading cause cancer death industrialized country . Most patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) present advanced disease , despite recent advance multi-modality therapy , overall 10-year survival rate le 10 % . A significant minority patient ( 25−30 % ) NSCLC stage I disease receive surgical intervention alone . Although 35−50 % patient stage I disease relapse within 5 year , currently possible identify specific high-risk patient . In addition , patient metastatic disease , standard chemotherapeutic approach result less 50 % response rate , mean half patient benefit suffer side effect . Only limited data exist marker capable predict response chemotherapy . This population would certainly also benefit marker . Another situation biomarker could potentially useful situation pulmonary nodule diagnose characterize . In situation biomarker could predict whether nodule cancerous thus , make CT Scan follow unnecessary .</detailed_description>
