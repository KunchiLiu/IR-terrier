	<brief_summary>This phase I study MK2206 ( AKT inhibitor ) gefitinib nonsmall cell lung cancer patient fail prior chemotherapy epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) . The patient population enrich EGFR mutation . The purpose study determine whether safe administer MK-2206 combination gefitinib adult patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . The second purpose study define MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) MK-2206 combine gefitinib . A standard 3-3 dose escalation scheme MK-2206 fix dose gefitinib use study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Defining Study For MK-2206 Combined With Gefitinib In Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical data communication Merck clinical pre-clinical group support application MK2206 EGFR-TKI , synergistic effect combination . This propose study phase I dose define study define MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) MK-2206 combine gefitinib . MK-2206 potent , orally active , allosteric inhibitor human AKT1 , AKT2 , AKT3 preclinical anti-tumor activity . This Phase I , single-center , open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation study patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC . Patients previously fail progressed EGFR inhibitor erlotinib gefitinib one line chemotherapy enrol study . Patients administered oral MK-2206 standard dose EGFR inhibitor gefitinib . This study conduct three cohort identify recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) MK-2206 combination standard dose gefitinib ( 250 mg QD ) . Cohorts 3 patient enrol sequentially escalate dos MK-2206 administer combination standard dose gefitinib . Patients advance dos MK2206 0/3 patient 0-1/6 develop DLT ( Dose-Limiting Toxicity ) . If 1/3 patient develops DLT , cohort expand 6 . If 2/6 patient develop DLT , dose de-escalate 90 mg Qwk . The high dose cohort 0-1/6 DLT deem MTD use cohort expansion total 15 patient .</detailed_description>
