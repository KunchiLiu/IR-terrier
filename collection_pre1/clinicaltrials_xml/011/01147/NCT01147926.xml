	<brief_title>Evaluation Prucalopride Male Subjects With Chronic Constipation .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase III trial subject screen enter 2-week run-in period ( 3-week run-in period subject use agent influence bowel habit ) presence constipation confirm [ subject complete electronic daily diary ( e-diary ) ] . At start run-in , exist laxative medication withdrawn subject instruct change diet lifestyle trial . Subjects allowed take laxative [ Dulcolax ( bisacodyl ) ] rescue medication trial , bowel movement ( BM ) 3 consecutive day . An enema use unsuccessful use Dulcolax ( bisacodyl ) . No Dulcolax ( bisacodyl ) take enema use 48 hour 48 hour first intake study medication . After run-in subject randomly assign placebo prucalopride equal ratio ( 1:1 ) subject fulfil constipation criterion inclusion . Randomisation stratify country average number complete bowel movement ( CBM ) run-in : 0 CBM/week &gt; 0 CBM/week . Adult subject ( i.e . subject ≥18 &lt; 65 year age ) take 2 mg prucalopride match placebo daily breakfast entire 12-week treatment period . Elderly subject ( i.e . subject ≥65 year age ) start dose 1 mg prucalopride match placebo daily breakfast . In case insufficient response , define average &lt; 3 spontaneous complete bowel movement ( SCBM ) /week precede 2 week treatment ( i.e . since previous visit ) Week 2 Week 4 , daily dose increase 2 mg ( match placebo ) . Once dose increase 2 mg daily subject stay dose remainder trial . After Week 4 ( Visit 4 ) change dose allow anymore .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject male outpatient ≥18 year age ( upper age limit ) . 2 . Subject history constipation . The subject report average ≤ 2 SBM/week result feel complete evacuation ( SCBM ) one follow least 6 month selection visit : 1 . Very hard ( little ball ) and/or hard stool least quarter stool ; 2 . Sensation incomplete evacuation follow least quarter stool ; 3 . Straining defecation least quarter time . This include subject never SBMs . The criterion applicable SBMs , i.e . BMs precede within period 24 hour intake laxative agent use enema . 3 . Subject agree stop current laxative treatment willing use rescue medication accord rescue rule [ Dulcolax® ( bisacodyl ) /enemas ] 4 . Subject 's constipation chronic . 5 . Subject able willing complete questionnaire ( validate version language subject available ) ediary . 6 . Subject voluntarily sign write Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) accordance regional laws/regulations , prior first trialrelated activity . 7 . Subject willing adhere trial requirement ( amongst others colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy , require ) . 1 . Subjects constipation think druginduced . 2 . Subjects use disallowed medication 3 . Subjects suffer secondary cause chronic constipation , : Endocrine disorder , e.g . hypopituitarism , hypothyroidism , hypercalcaemia , pseudohypoparathyroidism , pheochromocytoma glucagonproducing tumour , unless control appropriate medical therapy . Subjects insulindependent diabetes mellitus always exclude , also subject appropriate medical therapy ; Metabolic disorder ( e.g . porphyria , uraemia , hypokalaemia amyloid neuropathy , unless control appropriate medical therapy ) ; Neurological disorder ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease , cerebral tumour , cerebrovascular accident , multiple sclerosis , meningocele , aganglionosis , hypoganglionosis , hyperganglionosis , autonomic neuropathy neuropathy due chemotherapy , spinal cord injury , Chaga 's disease , major depression ) ; Surgery . Subjects insulindependent diabetes mellitus always exclude , irrespective whether constipation start prior onset diabetes . 4 . Subjects significant history cancer ( i.e . le 5year diseasefree survival ) . 5 . Subjects intestinal perforation obstruction due structural functional disorder gut wall , obstructive ileus , severe inflammatory condition intestinal tract , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis toxic megacolon/megarectum . Results endoscopy radiologic bowel evaluation require rule polyp , cancer , stricture structural organic disease : 1 . For patient ≤ 50 year : flexible sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy onset constipation symptom within previous 5 year ; 2 . For patient &gt; 50 year : flexible sigmoidoscopy /double contrast barium enema colonoscopy onset constipation symptom within previous 5 year . 3 . For subject , regardless age , even result test available within previous 5 year patient alarm symptom anemia , weight loss , heme positive stool , rectal bleeding : flexible sigmoidoscopy double contrast barium enema colonoscopy need onset symptom . 4 . If abnormality detect sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy e.g. , polyp , subject include trial polyp remove . If clinically indicate , repeat colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy need perform late within one week screen visit . If barium enema flexible sigmoidoscopy colonoscopic examination perform within period describe , assessment schedule screen visit within week follow screening . When clinically indicate repeat colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy need confirm result colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy performed screen visit , subject screen failure . 6 . Subjects know serious illness : clinically significant cardiac , vascular , liver , pulmonary , psychiatric disorder ( evaluated Investigator ) . 7 . Subjects condition opinion Investigator would complicate compromise trial wellbeing subject evidence clinically relevant pathology could interfere trial result put subject 's safety risk . 8 . Subjects know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection AIDS , hepatitis B hepatitis C. 9 . Subjects impaired renal function , i.e . serum creatinine concentration &gt; 180 μmol/l calculate creatinine clearance ≤30 ml/min , include subject require dialysis . 10 . Subjects clinically significant abnormality haematology , urinalysis , blood chemistry determine Investigator . If result haematology , biochemistry urinalysis test within laboratory 's reference range , subject include condition Investigator judge deviation clinically significant . This clearly record electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) . 11 . Subjects know history alcohol drug abuse previous 6 month . 12 . Subjects lactose intolerance expect low dos lactose lead diarrhoea , know allergy ingredient excipients trial medication . 13 . Subjects receive investigational drug 30 day precede runin period trial . 14 . Subjects previously use prucalopride .</criteria>
