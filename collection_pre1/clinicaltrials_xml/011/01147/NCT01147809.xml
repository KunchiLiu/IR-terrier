	<brief_summary>The present study randomize , blind , placebo-controlled , two-Phase , sequential cohort , dose find study ass safety efficacy eltrombopag patient solid tumor receive gemcitabine monotherapy combination gemcitabine plus carboplatin cisplatin . Phase I study examine safety tolerability various dos eltrombopag identify dose schedule eltrombopag . Phase II confirm chosen dose schedule eltrombopag Phase I deliver clinically meaningful benefit ( ) thrombocytopenic patient improve platelet number .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects eligible enrolment Phase I II study must meet following criterion : Signed write informed consent . Age ≥ 18 year . Subjects confirm solid tumor schedule receive least two cycle either gemcitabine monotherapy OR gemcitabine combination carboplatin cisplatin dosages schedule study . Novel anticancer agent ( e.g . bevacizumab , erlotinib ) may allow consider standard treatment investigator . Subjects ONE current diagnosis primary solid tumor allow study . Note : For patient schedule receive novel anticancer agent ( e.g . bevacizumab , erlotinib ) , consultation approval GSK medical monitor occur subject enrol study . Life expectancy least 3 month , opinion investigator . ECOGZubrod performance status ≤ 2 For Phase I : Prechemotherapy platelet count ≤ 300 Gi/L screen period subject start first planned cycle treatment gemcitabine monotherapy OR gemcitabine combination carboplatin cisplatin study . For Phase II ( Part 1 2 ) : Subjects must meet one follow platelet count entry criterion : 1 . Subjects start first cycle disease set platelet count &lt; 150 Gi/L screen period measure within 3 day Day 5 , OR 2 . Subjects start chemotherapy disease set platelet count &lt; 150 Gi/L Day 1 precede cycle entry study , OR 3 . Platelet count &lt; 100 Gi/L Day 8 precede cycle entry study , OR 4 . Platelet count &lt; 100 Gi/L Day 15 precede cycle entry study ( subject receive Gemcitabine monotherapy ) Note : For platelet count , repeat platelet count may allow ensure subject meet platelet count criterion late count take assessment eligibility study.. Subjects previous chemotherapy treatment previous disease set allow provide recovered chemotherapy relate toxicity except alopecia ( lab parameter mention Inclusion criterion # 9 ) . Adequate organ function screen period define criterion ( adequate baseline organ function ) : SYSTEM LABORATORY VALUES Hematologic Platelets , see Inclusion criterion ANC ( absolute neutrophil count ) ≥1.5 × 109/L Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Prothrombin time ( PT/INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) Within 80 120 % normal range Hepatic Albumin ≥2.5 g/dL Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN AST ALT 3 × ULN without liver metastasis 5 × ULN document liver metastasis Renal Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x ULN Subjects AST , ALT bilirubin value outside range ( ) table due Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gall stone exclude . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior randomization agree use effective contraception , study 4 week follow last dose investigational product . Men female partner childbearing potential must either prior vasectomy agree use effective contraception 2 week prior randomization 13 week last dose study treatment . Able swallow retain orally administer medication clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may alter absorption malabsorption syndrome major resection stomach bowel . Subjects meet follow criterion must enrol study : Lactating female . Preexisting cardiovascular disease ( congestive heart failure , New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Grade III/IV ) , arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) , unstable angina , subject QTc &gt; 450 msec ( QTc &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block ) study entry , myocardial infarction within precede 6 month . Subjects a34 pacemaker defibrillator exclude provided cardiac function within normal range . Note : For patient preexist NYHA Grade II cardiovascular disease , investigator consult GSK medical monitor enrol subject study . Patients know factor V leiden , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , prothrombin gene mutation , ATIII deficiency , protein C deficiency , protein S deficiency OR recent history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) within precede 6 month . Note : patient know risk factor thromboembolism e.g. , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , recent major surgery etc. , investigator consult GSK medical monitor enrol patient study risk factor document CRF . Prior surgery within two week study randomization radiotherapy ( RT ) within four week study randomization . Subjects prior surgery RT permit study unless completely recover surgery and/or acute RT toxicity except alopecia . Note : Note : patient minor surgery outpatient procedure ( e.g . insertion central venous catheter ) immediately allow study provide complication procedure surgery . History prior radiotherapy 20 % bone marrow bearing site . History platelet agglutination abnormality , platelet disorder dysfunction bleed disorder prevents reliable measurement platelet count . Subjects history CNS metastases clinical sign symptom brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis confirm CT MRI brain scan unless properly treat . Subjects CNS metastasis treat neurosurgical resection brain biopsy perform within 3 month prior randomization exclude . Treated brain metastasis define Having evidence progression hemorrhage treatment ongoing requirement dexamethasone , ascertain clinical examination brain imaging ( MRI CT ) screen period . Anticonvulsants ( stable dose ) allow . Treatment brain metastasis may include whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , radiosurgery ( RS ; Gamma Knife , LINAC , equivalent ) combination deem appropriate treating physician . Note : subject perform CT scan immediately prior screen period CT could repeat , MRI perform screening period exclude development brain metastasis and/or progression preexist brain metastatic lesion ( ) . Administration investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational product study . Concurrent participation another interventional clinical trial administration investigational drug study also permit . A known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy , opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor due drug chemically relate eltrombopag excipients ( e.g . mannitol ) . Subjects know Hepatitis B , hepatitis C Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . Subjects Gilbert 's Syndrome permit study .</criteria>
