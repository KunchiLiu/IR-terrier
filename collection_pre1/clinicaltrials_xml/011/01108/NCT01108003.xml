	<brief_title>Broccoli Sprout Extract Treating Patients With Transitional Cell Bladder Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : I . To determine tolerability toxicity broccoli sprout extract ( provide 200 micro mol isothiocyanate/dose/per day ) give 14 day patient destine undergo definitive bladder resection bladder cancer . Secondary Objectives : I . Establish safety administration broccoli extract bladder surgery specifically . II . Determine level isothiocyanates metabolite urine , blood , benign urothelium bladder cancer tissue . III . Assess antitumor effect broccoli extract primary bladder tumor measure angiogenesis , cell proliferation apoptosis . IV . Determine feasibility treat patient 200 micro mol isothiocyanate per dose per day broccoli sprout extract future therapeutic prevention clinical trial . Outline : Patients receive oral broccoli sprout extract daily day 1-14 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
