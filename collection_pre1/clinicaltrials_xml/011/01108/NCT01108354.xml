	<brief_summary>The aim present proposal prove adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) patient show low serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) bind use positron emission tomography ( PET ) selective radioligand [ 11C ] DASB . Specifically , 5-HTT binding quantify 20 adult medication-free ADHD patient ( 50 % female ) 20 age- sexmatched healthy control . Investigating untreated adult ADHD patient without psychiatric comorbidities provide opportunity estimate change serotonin transporter bind adult ADHD patient compare group healthy control . Several line evidence support hypothesis serotonergic neurotransmission may , addition dopamine , play important role aetiology ADHD . So far , PET study investigate serotonergic neurotransmission adult ADHD patient conduct , although alteration serotonin system may substantially involve susceptibility subtype characterization ADHD .</brief_summary>
