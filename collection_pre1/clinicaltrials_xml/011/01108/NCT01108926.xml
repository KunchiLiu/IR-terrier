	<brief_summary>The purpose study look level three HIV medication : tenofovir , emtricitabine , efavirenz blood drug intake stop order understand long drug persist blood . The study specifically look blood level three drug ( take 3-in-1 tablet ) take every day 14 day . This study randomise mean subject receive study medication order . You study doctor know study medication take time study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The administration combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) HIV-infected patient associate dramatic reduction AIDS-related morbidity mortality [ 1-3 ] . The key successful HIV drug treatment adhere prescribe combination every day [ 2 ] . The approval Atripla® ( tenofovir/emtricitabine/efavirenz co-formulated single tablet ) provide HIV care provider `` one tablet day '' therapy , make adherence much easy patient . However , HIV therapy , successful adherence also mean attention interval dose dietary restriction . Ideally , guarantee long-term virological response , HIV-infected patient take cART every day time . However , cART life dos forget delay . Importantly , 24-week 'Five-on-Two-off ' ( FOTO ) study result present November 2008 ; show HIV-infected patient stable ( viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL ) Atripla® randomise continue treatment daily stop take weekend , difference maintenance undetectable viral load observe . Eighty percent control arm 83 % 'weekend ' arm viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL [ 4 ] . This suggest either drug ' effect , drug , persist significant time follow drug intake cessation . However , persistence time inter-individual variability parameter component Atripla® clearly define . A drug 's persistence plasma cell depend half life . Long half-life antiretroviral agent may allow miss delayed dos , concentration maintain therapeutic level next dose take . NRTI pro-drugs must activate different phosphorilation step effective HIV . Intracellular triphosphate ( TP ) metabolites show characterized long half life . However , data drug persistence limit whether drug dos omit dose delay unknown . Knowledge length time drug contain Atripla® formulation last would increase confidence doctor combination . Importantly , triple regimen persistence investigate order provide information permissiveness ( forgotten delay dos ) whole regimen rather one single agent . Due simplicity administer Atripla® , study investigate pharmacokinetic `` forgiveness '' tenofovir emtricitabine ( plasma intracellularly ) plasma efavirenz would readily perform healthy volunteer would provide information advise HIV infect patient delay missed dos . Rationale pharmacogenomics analysis Pharmacogenetics hold promise HIV treatment complexity potential toxicity multi antiretroviral drug therapy prescribe long period . Thus far , candidate gene examine limited number allelic variant , number confirm association already emerge . From public health perspective , antiretroviral medication become increasingly available racially ethnically diverse population worldwide , understanding genetic structure population may allow u anticipate impact adverse response , even group represent drug registration trial . The exist literature pharmacogenetic determinant antiretroviral drug exposure , drug toxicity , well genetic marker associate rate disease progression underline recent advance occur past year . However , expect larger-scale comprehensive genome approach profoundly change landscape knowledge future . Additional study need assess implication long-term response antiretroviral agent . For reason plan collect single blood sample participant intensive pharmacokinetic study , one , order able investigate association genetic polymorphism drug disposition gene ( encode cytochrome P450 isoenzymes transmembrane transporter ) drug exposure . A candidate gene approach utilised examine locus interest . This procedure provide potentially important information genetic influence plasma drug concentration give insight improve management HIV-infected patient individualise therapy . These study power genetic association enable u build data base genotype-phenotype . Prospective genetic study would need plan base preliminary data .</detailed_description>
