	<brief_summary>This study center around image internal structure residual limb mean modern radiographic image technique ( Dynamic Radiography-DRSA ) . The purpose research study behavior bone soft tissue socket-stump interface dynamic task walk brisk walking . In long term research could prove basis improvement general design sockets new generation prosthetic device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Management Excess Residual Limb Pressure With New Smart Socket Technology/Intelligent Prosthetic Socket With Variable Volume Elevated Vacuum Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There little known dynamic condition inside prosthetic socket , despite several research effort base pressure sensor , static X-ray image and/or computer simulation ( FEM ) . The man reason inability current measuring device track enough resolution in-vivo high speed kinematics stump-socket interface . Socket manufacture rectification field still rely experience skill technician feedback patient . This result considerable dissatisfaction among user poor quantification socket fit problem . For low extremity amputee , well-fitting socket important element successful rehabilitation . The socket provide interface prosthesis residual limb , design provide comfort , appropriate load transmission , efficient movement control . Attaining objective extremely challenge , 55 % low limb amputee report dissatisfaction socket comfort , residual limb pain , and/or skin breakdown . In addition , current technique use produce socket suitable characteristic labor cost intensive , depend work skilled prosthetist relatively scarce compare number amputee . Currently , 500,000 low limb amputee U.S. alone , 60,000 new one every year . For upper extremity amputee issue related efficiency movement , load transmission comfort become even challenge due different nature associate motor skill perform task . Similarly l7,350 annual upper limb amputation distal elbow individual 21 year age US . In developed country 1.55 amputee per 1000 people . Most amputees wear prosthesis 70 hr/week use crutch wheelchairs alternative assistive device perform certain task . Current solution meet patient specific need . It suggest finding understand effect slippage harmful relative motion stump socket . Eventually new - scientific base - guideline fit artificial limb could recommend .</detailed_description>
