	<brief_title>Improving Low Bone Mass With Vibration Therapy Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis ( AIS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scoliosis three-dimensional spinal deformity AIS commonest high prevalence 2-4 % general population . As many 30 % AIS subject also suffer osteopenia persist result serious health problem later life include vertebral collapse , fragility fracture , decrease quality life even mortality . In spite , safe , effective evidence-based treatment protocol AIS-related osteopenia available . It remain uncertain effective dietary advice , physical activity , Calcium Vitamin D supplement regard . On hand , low-magnitude high-frequency vibration therapy show effective increase bone mass animal model clinical trial involve elderly subject . AIS-related osteopenia may different clinical behaviour . In addition , in-vivo effect bone quality never study . We plan carry scientific clinical study effect vibration therapy skeletally mature female AIS subject osteopenia . They randomly allocate either treatment control group . BMD , bone micro-architectures assessed delineate whether vibration therapy therapeutic effect improve low bone mass osteopenic AIS subject .</detailed_description>
