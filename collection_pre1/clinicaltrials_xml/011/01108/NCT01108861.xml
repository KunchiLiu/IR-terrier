	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize , multi-center study recruit patient in-stent restenosis superficial femoral artery . The safety efficacity Viabahn endoprosthesis ( W.L . Gore &amp; Associates ) , heparin-bonded endoprosthesis , compare plain old balloon angioplasty ( POBA ) . In 4 Belgian 2 German center total 80 Patients recruit . Primary endpoint primary patency 12 month , define evidence restenosis occlusion within originally treat lesion base color-flow duplex ultrasound ( CFDU ) measure peak systolic velocity ratio ≤2.5 , without target lesion revascularization ( TLR ) within 12 month . In comparison POBA , expect use Viabahn endoprosthesis ( W.L . Gore &amp; Associates ) result great 12 month primary patency treat superficial femoral artery in-stent restenotic lesion .</brief_summary>
