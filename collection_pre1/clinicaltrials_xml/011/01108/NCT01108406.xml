	<brief_title>Long Term Safety Sonitus SoundBite System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Sonitus Bone Conduction Device ( BCD ) bone conduction device single-sided deafness ( SSD ) . The Sonitus BCD consist Oral Appliance ( OA ) , external microphone component , wear behind ear ( BTE ) , calibration interface cable PC-controlled calibration software subject calibration . The Sonitus BCD pick sound microphone locate within ear canal deaf ear , capitalize acoustic natural pinna ear canal . The signal pick microphone transmit wirelessly removeable bone conduction oral appliance locate upper molar . The oral appliance receive acoustic signal BTE apply equivalent vibratory signal teeth reach skull via bone conduction rout transcranially contralateral cochlea .</detailed_description>
