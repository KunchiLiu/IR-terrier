	<detailed_description>Patients : This study conduct surgical intensive care unit ( SICU ) Yale New Haven Hospital prospective observational fashion . As pilot study determine accuracy CGM patient population base enrollment projection complete study within approximately 8 month time frame . We identify three group 15 patient candidate enrollment . The primary outcome degree correlation continuous glucose monitor capillary arterial blood sample . The first group patient present SICU hemodynamically unstable . Hemodynamic instability define systolic blood pressure le 90 mmHg requirement continuous infusion vasopressor maintain systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg . The second group patient similar group expect require massive fluid blood resuscitation ( &gt; 6L crystalloid &gt; 6 unit blood ) maintain systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg . This second group patient consist mainly trauma patient . These patient closest available relative approach consent participate trial . For patient enrolled surrogate regain decision make capacity inform participation study one investigator . The third group patient undergo elective surgical procedure likely require post-operative admission SICU . This group include patient undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair , esophagectomy , major abdominal thoracic operation likely require SICU stay 24 hour . At least half group consist diabetic patient . These patient select one investigator base likelihood require 24 hour SICU care . Based experience investigator believe able accurately predict patient require ICU stay least 24 hour . Most commonly patient significant co-morbid medical condition include coronary artery disease , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , obesity , etc . An attempt make contact patient pre-operatively telephone within 1 week plan surgery time detail research explain . Their willingness participate ascertain formally enrol sign consent morning surgery possible . On occasion patient require ICU stay post-operatively predict pre-operatively . These patient patient identified pre-operatively research team enrol post-operatively often surrogate similar study group . Similarly patient enrol pre-operatively subsequently require SICU admission undergo study procedure count towards total enrollment . Study Procedures : Upon arrival surgical ICU subcutaneous glucose sensor ( Guardian RT® CGMS ) place one investigator inform consent obtain . Insertion low lateral abdomen use insertion device provide Guardian RT® system . For patient low abdominal insertion impossible , e.g . open abdomen , site choose proximal thigh proximal arm base estimate thickness subcutaneous fat . The sensor transmit signal wirelessly receiver/monitor . This receiver/monitor maintain patient 's room . The meter calibrate base arterial capillary blood glucose obtain within one hour sensor insertion per pre-existing SICU routine care . The meter recalibrated every 12 hour base blood glucose measurement obtain per exist SICU routine . The exist protocol SICU measurement blood glucose every hour insulin infusion stable every 2 hour thereafter . For patient require sub-cutaneous insulin blood glucose measure minimum every 4 hour . If necessary sensor replace maximum three time within 12 hour placement consider failure . Capillary arterial blood glucose measure every hour patient require fluctuate insulin infusion . If patient stable insulin infusion blood glucose sample obtain every 2 hour . If patient insulin infusion glucose level obtain least every 4 hour per pre-existing SICU protocol . All arterial capillary glucose level enter Guardian RT® system . Blood glucose measurement per SICU routine . All SICU staff , physician study personnel blind CGMS reading . Sensors change 72 hour system identifies problem sensor correct standard system diagnostics per manufacturer recommendation . Total attempt sensor placement limit maximum 4 course subject 's participation study . Sensors remove patient transfer SICU , patient expires , patient 's care transition comfort measure . At end second sensor life-time ( 144 hour ) sensor remove data collection terminate . In addition glucose data , administration insulin medication likely affect blood glucose level perfusion status record infusion contain dextrose , include parenteral nutrition enteral feeding . All clinical event return trip operate room , development new infection , new organ failure , record investigative team . Additional data collect include age , gender , race , prior medical history , reason SICU admission , medication study prior , complication , day mechanical ventilation , length stay , daily vital sign , include weight vital sign abnormality , body mass index , liver failure , renal failure use renal replacement therapy . If patient develops skin reaction device adhesive maintaining device , remove new site employ possible tape replace standard transparent dressing . Data analysis : Data sensor download blood glucose value obtain use proprietary software Medtronic . Because CGMS system record glucose reading every 5 minute capillary arterial glucose sample obtain compare close CGMS reading within 2.5 minute time sample obtain . This generate set pair glucose level analysis . If sample fall immediately 2 reading later CGMS reading use minimize effect lag time interstitial glucose . Several method use assess accuracy CGMS . The International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) put forth requirement blood glucose monitoring system . For reference value ≤75mg/dl sensor value within ±15mg/dl , reference value &gt; 75mg/dl sensor value within ±20 % . We initially determine percentage glucose pair meet criterion . To determine degree agreement sensor reference mean difference ( MD , average sensor value - reference value ) , mean relative difference ( MRD , MD divide reference value multiply 100 ) calculate . The MD MRD allow determination general overestimation sensor . The mean absolute difference ( MAD , mean absolute value : sensor value - reference value ) calculate . The mean median absolute relative difference ( ARD , mean median absolute value : ( sensor value - reference value ) *100 / reference value ) also calculate . These absolute difference provide insight overall accuracy individual meter reading . In previous study medical intensive care unit 22 patient result 546 glucose pair analysis . The calculated MAD 19.7 standard deviation 18.3 . This result 95 % confidence interval [ 18.2-21.2 ] . In study use relatively conservative estimate 45 patient study 1 day ( 24 hour ) blood glucose measurement every 2 hour result 540 meter-sensor glucose pair . Based data study result similarly narrow confidence interval MAD . Bland-Altman plot construct . These plot difference value glucose pair ( y-axis ) versus average two member pair ( x-axis ) . These plot helpful identify particular area inaccuracy range glucose reading e.g . high low glucose level . The accuracy reference reading must consider analyze plot . Clarke error grids become one accepted method analyze continuous glucose data . These grid plot CGMS read versus reference value . Areas grid construct base clinical effect pair blood glucose . The paired glucose reading thereby classify good agreement erroneous varying level clinical consequence . In order identify inaccuracy base time delay CGMS randomly select one two multiple hour time period patient . We compare plots CGMS reading time shift plot capillary arterial blood glucose reading attempt obtain match identify effect time delay . We also analyze effect fluid load interstitial edema accuracy meter well time delay . We define significant interstitial edema increase body mass 15 % admission body weight . It anticipate able enroll 2 patient per month group generate study enrollment duration least 8 month . Enrollment fashion require approximately 5 monitor 75 sensor .</detailed_description>
