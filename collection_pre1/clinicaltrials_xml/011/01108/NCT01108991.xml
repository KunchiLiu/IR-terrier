	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common condition associate major disability . There strong evidence pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) improve outcomes cost saving , few 2 % patient access program . New method PR need increase access patient COPD establish benefit . To address gap propose novel physical activity self-management ( PASM ) program base evidence-based physical activity intervention design increase physical activity quality life . Key component program include tailor telephone counseling , workbook , computer-assisted telephone follow-up . We test follow two hypothesis : 1 ) Patients COPD receive PASM clinically statistically significant improvement functional performance ( i.e. , Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire [ CRQ ] dyspnea domain 6-minute walk ) compare patient receive UC . 2 ) The PASM program cost-effective compare UC . The project address major gap current management COPD may provide novel , cost-effective strategy improve functional performance health status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) target nationally `` priority '' condition multiple strategy need improve outcomes . The absolute number year lose disability due COPD exceed year life lose due premature death . There strong evidence pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) improve outcomes cost saving , few 2 % patient access program . New method PR need increase access patient COPD establish benefit . To address gap propose novel physical activity self-management ( PASM ) program base evidence-based physical activity intervention design increase physical activity quality life . Key component program include tailor telephone counseling , workbook , computer-assisted telephone follow-up . Our specific aim : 1 ) To implement PASM program patient COPD . 2 ) To conduct 18-month , randomize , control , single-blind trial compare PASM ( n=150 ) usual care ( UC ) ( n=150 ) determine effectiveness functional performance health status . 3 ) To determine cost-effectiveness intervention . Follow-up data collect 6 , 12 , 18 month start intervention . We test follow two hypothesis : 1 ) Patients COPD receive PASM clinically statistically significant improvement functional performance ( i.e. , Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire [ CRQ ] dyspnea domain 6-minute walk ) compare patient receive UC . 2 ) The PASM program cost-effective compare UC . The project address major gap current management COPD may provide novel , cost-effective strategy improve functional performance health status .</detailed_description>
