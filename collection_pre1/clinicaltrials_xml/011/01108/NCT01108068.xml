	<brief_summary>This pilot study 10 patient Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome ( OPPG ) Old Order Mennonite community , give lithium 6 month dual energy xray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , peripheral quantitative computerize tomography ( pQCT ) lab assessment baseline 6 month . Studies mouse model OPPG show lithium normalized bone strength . Controls ( n=20 ) recruit Old Order Mennonite community , minimize effect environmental lifestyle factor . The control give lithium . The age range participant 4-64 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma ( OPPG ) syndrome rare genetic disorder ( approximately 50 case report worldwide ) due mutation LRP5 gene , cause blindness birth fragile bone ( osteoporosis ) early childhood . The bony fragility lead recurrent fracture major bone hip ( femur ) spine , leave child wheelchair . Treatment strengthen bone OPPG primarily osteoporosis medication use fragile bone disorder childhood adult , namely bisphosphonates ( eg . pamidronate , alendronate ) . These drug help bone strength OPPG somewhat prevent fracture . We observe fracture hip 3 child OPPG treat , spite attain normal bone density ( determined DXA , dual xray absorptiometry ) bisphosphonates . Therefore , new treatment OPPG greatly need new method besides DXA need monitor bone strength treatment . A mouse model OPPG create . In mouse model OPPG , lithium dramatically improve bone , return normal strength prevent fracture . Lithium , use people psychiatric disease , know lead high bone strength reduce fracture people psychiatric disease . Lithium use safely approved child 12 . The theory lithium improve bone strength OPPG human , mouse , stimulate bone production bypass genetic defect OPPG . In study , plan treat 10 patient OPPG lithium 6 month , monitor response bone DXA pQCT ( peripheral quantitative compute tomography ) , latter give information bone quality . An IND obtain use lithium study .</detailed_description>
