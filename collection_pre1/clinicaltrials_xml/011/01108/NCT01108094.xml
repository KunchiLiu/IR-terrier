	<brief_summary>BCCs common human cancer US affect 1 million people . There effective drug prevent basal cell carcinoma skin . We hope learn oral antifungal drug , Itraconazole , might inhibit marker proliferation biomarker ( tumor signal pathway ) BCC development . Itraconazole FDA-approved drug treatment fungal infection skin , use past 25 year relatively side effect . It show mice reduce BCC biomarker reduce growth BCCs . Thus , may reduce BCC growth human .</brief_summary>
