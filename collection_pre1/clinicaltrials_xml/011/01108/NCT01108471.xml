	<brief_summary>We aim assess new pulse oximeter measure continuous hemoglobin concentration ( SpHb ) healthy patient undergo elective Cesarean delivery ( CS ) . This patient population often experience significant blood loss surgery , measurement surgical blood loss often inaccurate . We compare measurement SpHb estimate blood loss perioperative period , laboratory measurement hemoglobin set time interval perioperative postoperative period ( evaluate accuracy device 's ability measure continuous SpHb ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Invasive Measurement Hemoglobin ( Using Pulse Co-Oximetry ) Patients Undergoing Elective Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hope pulse oximeter provide important new information ( SpHb ) hemoglobin measurement patient undergo elective CS , may often experience significant blood loss postpartum anemia perioperative period . The measurement perioperative blood loss often inaccurate , formal measurement hemoglobin level often associate time delay , especially set ongoing acute blood loss . We hope device provide accurate continuous data hemoglobin patient population , may prove significant advance patient monitoring patient population . Probes SpHb measurement provide Masimo Corporation .</detailed_description>
