	<brief_title>Telemedicine Interventions Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea ( OSAH ) common chronic disease associate daytime sleepiness , impair health-related quality life ( QOL ) , increase risk hypertension cardiovascular disease . The common treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , although adherence CPAP poor one-third patient . Weight loss clearly lessen severity OSAH , although short-term dietary weight loss often achieve difficult maintain . Regular aerobic exercise associate low prevalence OSAH observational study adjustment body habitus , two small clinical trial moderate exercise associate substantial decrease OSAH severity despite little weight loss . Demonstrating dietary weight loss moderate physical activity , promote home setting , independently improve OSAH severity major impact therapeutic approach OSAH , disease highly prevalent VA population . Objective : The investigator hypothesize moderate-intensity physical activity dietary weight loss independently reduce OSAH severity improve QOL . Methods : The propose study randomize clinical trial design test independent effect physical activity diet intervention , attention control intervention subject assign either active intervention . Subjects male female Veterans BMI 24 kg/m2 , physician diagnosis OSAH apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 10/hr . The intervention last six month .</detailed_description>
