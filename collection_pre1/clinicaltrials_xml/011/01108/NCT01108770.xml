	<brief_title>Evaluation Phenotypic Genetic Properties Male Subjects Affected By Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design obtain information male subject HED unaffected male control subject . The study consist standardize collection data HED medical history questionnaire non-invasive test . A subset subject undergo genetic testing . All data collect family attend 2010 NFED Family Conference , July 22-24 , 2010 , Colorado Springs , CO . Since HED rare disease , difficult obtain reliable data sufficient number subject one region . The NFED Family Conference location family affect HED come together , therefore , present ideal location obtain data need design future study . As procedure non-invasive design take relatively short period time , subject participate study attend NFED Family Conference .</detailed_description>
