	<brief_summary>Asthma common chronic disease childhood affect 6.2 million child 2 18 year age , common cause school absenteeism due chronic disease . African American child 3 4 time likely hospitalize asthma 4 6 time likely die disease compare European Americans . The economic burden country asthma enormous , exceed $ 16 billion 2004 . Though cure asthma , several drug available show generally safe effective controlling symptom . Beta 2 agonist commonly use asthma drug . When inhaled drug relax cell lung , help patient asthma breath easy . Two type beta agonist use short-acting beta agonist ( SABA ) long-acting beta agonist ( LABA ) . SABA , like albuterol , use provide quick relief chest tighten help patient breathe easy . Long-acting beta agonist ( LABA ) also help patient breathe easier long period time . Continued SABA use ( example , inhale albuterol 3 4 time day ) recommend , continue LABA use recommend use together inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . ICS commonly use drug use asthma protects inflammation lung . Studies past 50 year suggest continue use SABA , LABA , combination ICS+LABA may worsen asthma patient reduce effect beta agonist , increase rate asthma attack , decrease ability lung work efficiently , death . Recent study suggest asthma worsen continued beta agonist use occurs individual certain genotype . Genotype refers form protein , call beta2 adrenergic receptor ( b2AR ) , lung beta agonist work . Because difference genetic make , different form b2AR . One form call Arg16 genotype form call Gly16 genotype . Compared Gly16 genotype , patient asthma genotyped Arg16 appear susceptible asthma worsening associate continue use SABA , LABA ICS+LABA . Most study influence genotype asthma worsen associate beta agonist use perform adult . The result small number study suggest child susceptible asthma worsen chronic beta agonist use compare adult , child Arg16 genotype susceptible asthma attack child Gly16 genotype . Some evidence suggest child asthma treat ICS+LABA , yet since 2000 , rate child asthma switched ICS therapy alone ICS+LABA increase significantly . The major question pose propose study : Does treatment ICS+LABA compare ICS alone cause worsen asthma child asthma genotyped Arg16 homozygotes Gly16 homozygote ? The specific aim project evaluate safety ICS+LABA child asthma separate accord genotype . Children asthma screen , assent care taker ( parent , example ) consent . A sample saliva collect genetic material ( DNA ) collect purpose genotyping . A total 90 European African American child , 45 Arg16 45 Gly16 genotype , treat 16 week . Half genotype randomly assign receive ICS alone 16 week half receive ICS+LABA . At end 16 week , start ICS receive ICS+LABA receive ICS+LABA first take ICS alone . Before month treatment , participant visit clinic undergo test assess lung function , well asthma control , level inflammation quality life . The result study expected major impact way child asthma treat drug . If result study show Arg16 genotype bad asthma take ICS+LABA compare ICS alone conclude safety combination child questionable test large population child determine popular combination use child asthma . If result show combination genotype worsen asthma compare ICS treatment , conclude combination safe use child , least 16 week .</brief_summary>

For European Americans , frequency Arg16 homozygosity 15 % compare 30 % African Americans ( 48 ) . In previous study , PI restrict analysis European Americans potential confound population stratification ( 48 ; 49 ) . . Participants must diagnosis asthma . In addition , participant must persistent asthma define NAEPP guideline : asthma symptom &gt; 2 day ; &gt; 3 4 nighttime awakening ; SABA use &gt; 2 days/week ; prebronchodilator % predict &gt; 60 % ; FEV1/FVC normal reduce 5 % .

Participants discontinue asthma medication duration study include theophylline , LTRAs ( montelukast ) , LABA monotherapy , ipratropium bromide .
