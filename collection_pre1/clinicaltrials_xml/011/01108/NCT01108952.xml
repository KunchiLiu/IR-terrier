	<brief_summary>Background : While treatment pediatric cancer improve significantly past 40 year , neurotoxic side-effects chemotherapy agent recognize . Two drug suspect acute impact memory performance child methotrexate ( MTX ) steroid ( GCs ) . In addition , new evidence suggest neurotoxicity might actually protect child traumatization . Working hypothesis aim : This project aim examine acute impact MTX GC chemotherapy memory performance child young adult cancer , subsequent impact development traumatic symptom . We hypothesize MTX GCs produce acute decline memory performance child great reduction memory performance few traumatic symptom . Methods : The investigator recruit 45 child treat MTX GCs Dana Children 's Hospital . To determine acute impact memory , battery memory test administer cycle MTX cycle GCs . In addition , traumatic symptom assess post-chemotherapy evaluation point Expected result : The investigator expect poor memory performance MTX GCs performance decline correlate low rate traumatic symptom . Importance : The immediate impact MTX GCs memory well know , especially child . In addition , recent finding lead u hypothesize chemotherapy-induced deficit memory function would paradoxically protect patient traumatization often associated cancer treatment . The propose study test novel hypothesis first time .</brief_summary>
