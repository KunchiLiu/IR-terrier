	<brief_summary>- Diabetic foot ulcer ( DFU ) one chronic consequence diabetes constitute important cause non-traumatic amputation inferior limb . Patients diabetes 22 time likely foot ulceration gangrene nondiabeticsï¼Œwhile foot ulceration precede 85 % lower-extremity amputation . - Three factor combine promote tissue necrosis diabetic foot : ischemia , neuropathy trauma . Among , ischemia peripheral arterial disease may play important role development DFU . Moreover , diffuse vascular disease main characteristic , thus become difficult treatment use arterial bypass balloon angioplasty . Therefore , hypothesize continuous arterial thrombolysis may effective therapy diabetic foot . The purpose study investigate effectiveness safety continuous intra-femoral artery injection urokinase micro-artery-pump diabetic ulcer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Therapeutical Role Continuous Intra-femoral Artery Infusion Urokinase Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- We select 200 diabetic patient Wagner grade 1 ~ 3 foot ulcer . They divide two group randomly : thrombolysis group control group , 100 case group . - After diabetic dietary advice , patient receive insulin therapy control blood glucose within range 5 - 10 mmol/L . Then patient receive conventional care ulcer . To remove extensive callus necrotic tissue , wound debridement perform . Broad spectrum antibiotic prescribe ulcer show clinical sign infection . Adjustments treatment perform indicated basis microbiologic culture sensitivity test . - The conventional group patient receive intravenous injection prostaglandin E1 ( 20 ug per day ) heal ulcer discharge hospital . In continuous intra-femoral thrombolysis group , first , ultrasound Doppler examination vessel include artery venous low limb perform . To avoid pulmonary infarction , filtrator place inferior vena cava thrombolysis process ultrasound result show venous thrombosis . Then insert percutaneous artery canal femoral artery another low limb distal popliteal artery far possible . After finish process , outside part artery canal fix thigh , patient must keep supine position bed.Firstly,20 0000 ~ 40 0000 unit urokinase injected via catheter diseased foot . Then , continuous infusion urokinase via femoral artery artery pump ( 100 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride + 100 0000 unit urokinase rate 4 ml per one hour ) 7 - 10 day . Finally , patient receive intravenous injection prostaglandin E1 ( 20 ug per day ) heal ulcer discharge hospital . - The heal rate foot ulcer , time ulcer , neuropathy symptom , period hospitalization compare two group hospitalization . - The recurrence rate foot ulcer , cardiovascular event , death cause compare two group 1 , 4 , 8 year follow .</detailed_description>
