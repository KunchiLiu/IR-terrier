	<brief_summary>The study consist two part : Drug Interaction ( Pharmacokinetic ) Phase Pharmacodynamic Phase The primary study objective Drug Interaction Study determine pharmacokinetic interaction RAD001 JI-101 . The primary study objective Pharmacodynamic Study progression-free survival 2 moth , evaluate separately three cohort . These include determination tumor response use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Criteria assessment ephrinB4 expression blood sample . Secondary objective determine safety tolerability JI-101 . The investigational product everolimus ( 42-O- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) rapamycin ) JI-101 ( 1- [ 1- ( 2-amino-pyridin-4-ylmethyl ) -1H-indol-4-yl ] -3- ( 5-bromo-2 methoxy-phenyl ) -urea ) Eligible patient meet study entry criterion enrol study . For Drug Interaction study , patient solid tumor receive single dose ( 10 mg ) Everolimus mouth Day 1 Day 8 JI-101 capsule ( 200 mg ) mouth Day 8 Day 15 . For Pharmacodynamic Study , patient receive JI-101 capsule mouth ( 200 mg BID ) 28 day treatment cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-center , non-randomized , open-label study evaluate safety efficacy RAD001 JI-101 patient solid tumor . Patients complete Screening evaluation within 21 day Study Cycle 1Day 1 . All patient provide write Informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) authorization procedure assessment initiated purpose protocol . For Drug Interaction Study , Everolimus administer eligible patient Cycle 1 Day 1 blood drawn pharmacokinetic analysis prior dose 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 24 hour dose . On Day 8 , Everolimus JI-101 administer blood drawn pharmacokinetic analysis prior dose 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 24 hour dose . On Day 15 , JI-101 administer blood drawn pharmacokinetic analysis prior dose 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 24 hour dose . Patients continue receive JI-101 ( 200 mg BID ) 28 day treatment cycle . Patients Drug Interaction Study also receive CT scan prior screen every 2 treatment cycle . For Pharmacodynamic Study , JI-101 dispense eligible patient Cycle 1 Day 1 . JI-101 administer ( 200 mg BID ) 28 day treatment cycle . PET CT scan perform prior commence treatment standard care . A CT scan perform otherwise . Patients return study site every 2 cycle complete safety assessment radiologic tumor assessment ( CT and/or PET ) . Adverse event monitor follow first administration investigational product duration patient 's participation study . Archival tissue collect detection mutation relevant pathway development assay study modulation pathway target JI-101 .</detailed_description>
