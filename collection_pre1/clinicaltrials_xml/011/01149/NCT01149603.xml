	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose Destination Therapy Evaluation Failing Fontan Study ( DEFINe Study ) perform single center physician-investigator lead feasibility study initiate examination safety efficacy implant continuous flow circulatory support device 20 patient fail Fontan physiology , amenable surgical medical therapy candidate heart transplantation . Based upon result DEFINe study , consideration would give large multicenter study . The primary endpoint survival without disable stroke two year . Safety , functional status , total day alive follow hospital discharge quality life assessment evaluate secondary endpoint . Background : Patients bear congenital anomaly single ventricle often undergo Fontan procedure improve oxygenation circulation . As patient matures , benefit Fontan procedures become exhausted . These patient present young adult heart failure , consider heart transplantation . `` Failed Fontan '' physiology patient commonly survive 30 40 due advancement surgical Fontan procedure last several decade . Yet , many patient appropriate transplant candidate due progression pulmonary failure surpass pulmonary vascular resistance limit , end organ failure effect liver , cardiac failure present leave ventricular ejection fraction less 25 % . Congenital heart disease consider high risk indication transplantation . Such patient present complex anatomy , scar tissue prior procedure , unique pathological state limit ability ass hemodynamics . Methods : Patients fail Fontan physiology evaluate surgical intervention , heart transplantation participation study long-term support , know Destination Therapy ( DT ) . Patients meet study criterion ask participate sub-study collect patient information . Consenting patient meet study criterion implant HeartMate II Ventricular Assist Device ( VAD ) improve cardiac output . Following VAD implantation , patient recover hospital , discharge home approve facility . Study data collect long patient receive VAD support . Placement VAD continue patient care improve cardiac output quality life population patient born congenital anomaly single ventricle . Outcomes : The primary endpoint study examine survival without disable stroke two year ( define score four great Modified Rankin Scale ) . Safety , functional status , total-days-alive follow hospital discharge , quality life assessment evaluate secondary endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This single center nonrandomized observational study lead PI . However , patient recruit center participate trial . The recruited patient ineligible cardiac transplantation refer institution . The study institution also evaluate patient cardiac transplantation . If patient determine ineligible transplantation study institution , patient meet study inclusion criterion pertain two institutional turn down transplant . The protocol design way attract propose 20 study patient , allow second opinion whether patient transplant candidate . The patient may pursue cardiac transplantation institution deem him/her transplant eligible , applicable . Those patient candidate transplantation could consider propose research study . Patients need sign inform consent screen study . Patients meet inclusion exclusion criterion implant HeartMate II VAD data collect described section `` data collection '' . Patients fail meet study inclusion exclusion criterion ask participate sub-study . The sub-study collect screen baseline data , clinically indicate . Primary Endpoint : The primary endpoint examine survival without disable stroke two year ( define score four great Modified Rankin Scale ) . Patients reach primary endpoint survival without disable stroke two year consider success study . The percent patient successful outcome target 80 % patient survive 2 year without disable stroke general Destination Therapy patient population Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center . The current survival rate 53 % survival 2 year . Therefore , primary endpoint 40 % survival ( 8 20 patient ) 2 year without disable stroke purpose . Data relate freedom disable stroke roughly base work publish Tsukui et al . show 33-75 % freedom cerebrovascular accident 6 month differ device group patient wait bridge-to-transplant candidate . Secondary Endpoints : Safety , functional status , total-days-alive follow hospital discharge , quality life assessment evaluate secondary endpoint . Secondary endpoint evaluate throughout study one- two- year follow-up time point last patient enrol study . The study design improve quality life , addition length life . - Safety evaluate cause mortality , incidence serious adverse event , per Interagency Registry Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support ( INTERMACS ) definition ( except modify bleed neurocognitive event definition ) , Incidence device replacement device repair due failure . - Functional status hospitalization evaluate cardio-pulmonary stress test ( V.O2 peak ) , New York Heart Association class , 6-minute walk test , total number day alive out-of-hospital . - Quality life assess Minnesota Living Heart Failure Euro-QOL questionnaire .</detailed_description>
