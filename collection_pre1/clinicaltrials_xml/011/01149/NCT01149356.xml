	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I trial study side effect best dose RO4929097 give together exemestane see well work compare exemestane alone treat premenopausal postmenopausal patient advance metastatic breast cancer . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use exemestane may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving exemestane together RO4929097 may kill breast cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RO4929097 And Exemestane Treating Pre- Postmenopausal Patients With Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum-tolerated dose gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) combination exemestane pre- postmenopausal patient estrogen receptor-positive ( ER+ ) advance metastatic breast cancer . II . Determine safety tolerability regimen patient . III . Determine progression-free survival patient treat exemestane v without RO4929097 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall tumor response rate patient treat regimen . II . Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . III . Determine safety regimens patient . IV . Determine quality life patient treat regimen . V. Identify biomarkers response treatment toxicity . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 . Patients receive oral exemestane daily day 1-21 oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stratify accord menopausal status ( pre- v postmenopausal ) visceral disease ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive exemestane phase I oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 MTD determine phase I . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive exemestane arm I . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In addition exemestane , pre-menopausal patient receive goserelin subcutaneously every 28 day . Patients may undergo blood tissue sample collection correlative study . Patients may complete quality-of-life questionnaire baseline periodically study use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer ( FACT-B ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
