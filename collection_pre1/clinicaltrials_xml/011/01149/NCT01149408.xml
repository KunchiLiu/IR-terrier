	<detailed_description>The median age patient AML presentation 65 70 year ( Peterson 1977 , Brincker 1985 , Baudard 1994 ) incidence AML increase advance age ( Wingo 1995 ) . Given , increased attention focus adult patient 60 year old disease . Treatment strategy young patient well establish however therapy elderly deserves particular thought ( Foon 1981 , Sebban 1998 , Lowenberg 1998 ) . Also progress treatment AML elderly population near progress make treatment young population ( Stone 2002 , Kantarjian 2006 ) . Poor tolerability questionable treatment benefit leave old adult patient AML often without effective treatment option best supportive care . According Medicare record , 30 % cohort 2657 AML patient older 65 year provide chemotherapy treatment ( 44 % patient 65 74 year , 24 % patient 75 84 , 6 % patient 85 ) . The mortality 86 % 1 year 94 % 2 year follow diagnosis . The overall survival cohort 2 month ( Menzin 2002 ) . The study could distinguish intensive induction chemotherapy palliative therapy . Despite modest improvement outcomes young patient AML , adults 55 year age ( majority patient AML ) continue poorly ( Tallman 2005 ) . In patient 60 year response rate range 40 % 55 % patient 70 year range 24 % 33 % ( Buchner 2009 , Estey 2007 , Lowenberg 1998 , Rowe 2004 ) . Patient leukemia related factor could explain poor result old patient AML ( Harry 2007 , Gupta 2005 ) . Also patient 60 , adverse cytogenetics response rate range 26 % 34 % ; antecedent hematologic disorder range 28 % 46 % ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 2 around 26 % . ( Grimwade 2001 , Rowe 2004 , Appelbaum 2006 ) . For past several decade , standard induction chemotherapy acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) consist `` 7+3 '' regimen cytarabine plus anthracycline . Standard consolidation chemotherapy consist high dose cytarabine 3-4 cycle . Few trial randomize old patient AML receive standard remission induction ( i.e. , anthracycline-containing ) chemotherapy versus either palliative therapy less intensive chemotherapy . The median survival old adult AML treat cytarabine plus anthracycline `` 7+3 '' schedule 8 12 month ( Estey 2007 , Rowe 2004 ) . Less 10 % patient remain remission 3 year . ( Lowenberg 1998 , Godwin 2003 , Roboz 2007 ) . The European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) conduct trial 60 patient randomized intensive chemotherapy ( daunorubicin 30 mg/m2/day intravenously [ IV ] 3 day , vincristine 1 mg/m2/day IV Day 2 , cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day IV 7 day 50 mg/m2/day IV bolus every 12 hour 7 day ) `` watch wait '' approach ( supportive care alone hydroxyurea 3 g PO Days 1 4 LDAC ( subcutaneous cytarabine ) 100 mg/m2 every 12 hour SC Days 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 administer leukemia-related symptom occur ) . All patient 65 year old , preserve organ function performance status . The patient receive induction chemotherapy high complete remission ( CR ) rate ( 58 % vs. 0 % ) , low incidence early mortality ( 3/31 vs. 18/29 patient ) , long median survival ( 21 week vs. 11 week ) great chance survival 2.5 year ( 17 % vs. 0 % ) . The median duration hospitalization statistically differ two group . In study perform Tilly et al ( Tilly 1990 ) patient &gt; 65 year old , 87 patient randomize receive either LDAC 10 mg/m2 SC every 12 hour 21 day standard chemotherapy induction rubidazone ( daunorubicin-derived agent ) 100 mg/m2 IV 4 day plus cytarabine 200 mg/m2 IV 7 day . The combination chemotherapy arm associate 31 % early death rate compare with10 % low dose arm . There high CR rate rubidazone/cytarabine arm ( 52 % versus 32 % ) , trend toward improved survival favor arm ( 12.8 month versus 8.8 month ) report . Repetitive cycle high dose Cytarabine ( HiDAC- 3 g/m2 ARA-C twice day day 1 , 3 , 5 ) effective consolidation regimen AML patient base CALGB 1994 ( Mayer 1994 ) . In patient young 60 , protocol produce high rate continuous CR . However patient older 60 , high rate neurotoxicity report use regimen ( Mayer 1994 ) . A follow study modify protocol use Intermediate Dose Cytarabine ( IDAC ) ( 1 g/m2 ARA-C twice day day 1 , 3 , 5 ) apply regimen group elderly patient ( ≥60 year ) de novo AML . This protocol ( IDAC ) find effective well-tolerated consolidation regimen elderly patient ( Sperr 2004 ) . Based study median overall survival , disease-free survival , continuous CR 10.6 , 15.5 , 15.9 month , respectively ( Sperr 2004 ) . Thus , data obtain study , chemotherapy form superior best supportive care alone best supportive care chemotherapy initiate evidence disease progression . However single treatment approach appear adequate consider standard care elderly AML patient . Thus , improve treatment strategy suitable chemotherapy regimen need ( Harry 2007 ) . Additionally , clear best administer chemotherapy currently available drug , take account induction consolidation treatment . Several different category new therapy development , include multidrug resistance ( MDR ) reversal agent , immunomodulatory therapy , signal transduction target . Table 1 show example target agent develop develop . Given lack standard treatment elderly AML , use newer agent treat AML justify . Table 1 : Targets New Agents Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( Medscape.com ) Targets Agents CD33 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin CD45 131I-anti-CD45 MDR1/Pgp Cyclosporine , PSC-833 Angiogenesis and/or VEGF Thalidomide , SU-5416 , bevacizumab antibody Hypermethylated chromatin Decitabine Histone deacetylase Phenylbutyrate trichostatin A , trapoxin Bcl-2 Bcl-2 antisense S-phase checkpoint UCN-01 20S proteasome PS-341 Tyrosine kinase ( c-kit receptor ) STI-571 Flt-3 kinase CEP-701 Farnesyl transferase BMS-214662 , R115777 A sizeable percentage old adult attain complete remission induction chemotherapy , almost patient relapse within median four eight month unless give additional cytotoxic therapy ( Cassileth 1999 ) . Even post-remission therapy , relapse common . Furthermore , post-remission therapy old adult complicate high rate treatment related toxicity . To address problem post-remission therapy , Nordic MDS group perform phase II multicenter study , study long-term maintenance azacitidine . They study patient high-risk MDS AML arise MDS . The mean age group 68 year . Patients achieve CR induction receive low dose azacitidine sq 5 28 day relapse . They note median CR duration 13.5 month note mild side effect ( Grovdal 2008 ) . In another phase II trial Decitabine use untreated AML patient older 60 candidate intensive chemotherapy ( refuse ) . PS ECOG &lt; 3 . All pt receive induction Decitabine 20mg/m2 IV day 1-10 4 week cycle . Patients persistent AML end cycle receive repeat 10 day course , respond patient receive maintenance shorten course 3-5 day depend degree duration neutropenia . Forty two percent patient achieve CR . Median OS yet reach ; median f/u 19 survive patient 8 month . The median number cycle receive till date publication five ( Blum 2009 ) . One retrospective study study 141 elderly AML patient first CR 7+3 induction chemotherapy . In patient age 60-70 year , consolidation ± maintenance therapy improve outcome ( DFS OS ) . In patient older 70 WBC &lt; 30 x109/l maintenance therapy without consolidation improve outcome . In patient older 70 WBC &lt; 30 x 109/l consolidation therapy worsen outcome . In patient older 70 WBC &gt; 30 x 109/l , consolidation and/or maintenance therapy improve outcome ( Corre 2005 ) . The purpose study determine whether feasible use maintenance treatment ( prolonged treatment several month ) Decitabine elderly patient AML obtain remission standard chemotherapy . The study also aim obtain preliminary result whether approach prolongs period remission standard chemotherapy . The study group include elderly ( ≥60 year age ) , Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) patient tolerate aggressive therapy .</detailed_description>
