	<brief_title>Cerebral Oximetry Neurological Outcomes Aortic Arch Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Permanent transient neurologic dysfunction frequent complication patient undergoing aortic arch surgery . Two basic method brain protection currently use concomitantly complex surgical procedure : deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA ) without retrograde cerebral perfusion ( RCP ) selective antegrade hypothermic cerebral perfusion . Hypothermic circulatory arrest provide optimal bloodless operative field , incidence neurological dysfunction increase duration DHCA exceed 45-50 minute . Antegrade cerebral perfusion accomplish mean direct differential cannulation common carotid right subclavian artery . Because technique brain protection require separate perfusion circuit , vigilant monitoring perfusion pressure flow rate utmost importance . Multiple study demonstrate antegrade selective cerebral perfusion well establish technique use cerebral protection aortic surgery require long period DHCA favorable result hospital mortality neurologic outcome . The permanent neurological dysfunction note 3.8 % transient neurologic dysfunction 7.1 % patient receive antegrade selective cerebral perfusion . Similarly , neurocognitive study DHCA antegrade cerebral perfusion patient undergoing aortic arch operation demonstrate 9 % transient neurocognitive impairment 2 day postoperatively last 3 week thereafter . Consistent current surgical practice , University Michigan use antegrade selective cerebral perfusion patient undergoing aortic arch surgery require DHCA without RCP . A number monitoring modality use detect cerebral malperfusion aortic surgery carotid surgery , include transcranial Doppler ultrasound near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . The impact monitoring modality clinical ( neurologic ) outcome clearly establish . Currently , NIRS gain considerable attention acceptance non-invasive monitor cerebral oxygenation . One study show sustain drop regional oxygen saturation ( rSO2 ) 55 % 5 minute use cerebral oximetry closely related occurrence neurological event follow aortic surgery . Another study strongly support rSO2 drop &gt; 20 % baseline prevent neurologic compromise . In cohort elective coronary artery bypass graph ( CABG ) patient , intervention cerebral desaturations show significantly less major organ morbidity mortality ( death , ventilation &gt; 48 h , stroke , myocardial infarction , return re-exploration . Whether NIRS use monitor provide rapid detection prevention cerebral ischemia early intervention may improve neurological outcome patient undergoing aortic surgery require DHCA without RCP currently unknown .</detailed_description>
