	<brief_summary>Atopic Dermatitis ( AD ) eczema chronic relapse inflammatory disease affect 1-3 % adult 25 % child United States . Patients severe AD study 24-week study systemic cyclosporine ( Neoral , capsule form ) evaluate immune suppression pathological correlation cyclosporine A patient order determine extent immune activation drive pathological epidermal phenotype .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reversal Epidermal Phenotype Severe Atopic Dermatitis With Cyclosporine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients first screen sure healthy ( aside atopic dermatitis ) physical exam , lab test . These lab test consist CBC , biochemical profile , hepatitis B C profile , urine analysis , HIV , PPD , urine pregnancy test ( applicable ) . Patients return 2 3 day PPD reading . A repeat serum creatinine drawn time 2 baseline value . Patient begin take cyclosporine 5 mg/kg body weight 2 divided daily dose 12 week , period dose reduce 1mg/kg per week ( taper start 12 week treatment ) , cessation treatment occur 16 week start treatment . Patients follow clinic additional 8 week potential relapse , relapse occur topical treatment corticosteroid , immune-modulators phototherapy may institute . Patients see outpatient clinic baseline , wks 1,2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 every 2weeks completion 24-week study . Biopsies ( lesional non-lesional skin ) do assess histological response baseline , week 2 , week 6 ( optional ) , week 12 relapse ( optional ) . Bloods safety analysis pregnancy test ( applicable ) do visit , vital sign measure time . Serum IgE , eosinophils , serum cytokine do baseline , every 2 week week 16 , week 24 . At visit patient assessed adverse event . Clinical assessment , ultrasound , do visit . The widely accepted clinical assessment tool know SCORAD ( SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ) . This tool combine clinical feature AD erythema , dryness , lichenification , percent body surface area , well quality life issue pruritus loss sleep due disease . Another assessment tool use static IGA ( investigator global assessment ) . The IGA represent overall evaluation dermatitis perform investigator every visit . IGA score utilize 6-point scale , range 0 ( clear ) 5 ( severe disease ) . IGA score measure disease severity base morphology , without refer back baseline state . Ultrasound study provide alternate , non-invasive method assess disease activity skin . Clinical photo do week 0 , 6 , 12 , 16 , 24.In study , would like determine whether AD , like psoriasis , immune-driven disease epidermal hyperplasia differentiation . To establish immune contribution AD , treat patient standard dos CsA measure extent immune suppression skin lesion quantitative measure pathological leukocyte expression inflammatory gene product . At end 12 week treatment determine whether pathological epidermal hyperplasia reverse quantitative qualitative measure epidermal hyperplasia aberrant epidermal differentiation . In addition , correlate extent epidermal phenotype modulate extent skin inflammation suppress , effect suppression specific inflammatory molecule result keratinocyte response know . The alternative hypothesis AD immune-mediated disease , instead disease primary epidermal differentiation due germline alteration ( gene deletion ) filaggrin gene cooperate differentiate normal epidermal barrier level stratum corneum . The alternative hypothesis consider likely patho-mechanism AD number current researcher . The alternative hypothesis would support study pathologic epidermal hyperplasia persist skin region significant suppression immune/inflammatory pathway induce CsA treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Severe AD ( define mean SCORAD score &gt; 40 , , significant disease activity , pruritus , sleep disturbance ( 13 ) , suitable treatment Cyclosporine , fail unsuitable treatment modality , include topical systemic steroid phototherapy . Patients must also IGA score 3 great , Males females age 18 ( female childbearing potential must agree use acceptable contraception study ) . No systemic treatment contraception must commence 2 week prior initiate drug . No systemic treatment 4 week , topical treatment phototherapy 2 week Previously treat cyclosporine unacceptable toxicity Past current history malignancy ( except treat isolated skin cancer ) Renal , hepatic , hematologic laboratory value great CTC grade 1 toxicity , limited creatinine &gt; 1.5 ULN , SGOT &gt; 2.5 ULN . Values great grade 1 would likely represent clinically significant renal , hepatic hematologic disease Stage I hypertension define &gt; 140/90 . Patients blood pressure high two separate occasion , whether medication , exclude ( JNC guideline www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension ) Significant lipid panel abnormality ( grade 1 toxicity CTC scale ) Lactating female Other medical condition would increase risk cyclosporine toxicity Positive PPD Primary secondary immune deficiency ( include know HIV status ) Possible know pregnancy Serious infection ( active hepatitis ) Drug alcohol abuse Inability lack willingness cooperate regular monitoring Severe photodamage/precancerous skin lesion due previous sunlight exposure , photo/photochemotherapy Concurrent use PUVA UVB , radiation therapy , Concurrent use immunosuppressive agent MTX , Immuran , Cyclophosphamide , Cellcept , etc . ( possibility excessive immunosuppression subsequent risk malignancy ) Active infection , infection history serious infection require hospitalization , antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal within 30 day baseline History inflammatory skin condition ( psoriasis , pemphigus , etc . Patients background skin condition might directly relate atopic dermatitis ( post inflammatory hyperpigmentation ) exclude well common background noninflammatory skin condition seborrheic keratosis , benign pigment lesion , acne , etc</criteria>
