	<brief_summary>The purpose study detect genetic association development schizophrenia ( SZ ) bipolar illness ( BP ) compare Veterans diseases `` psychiatrically healthy '' Veterans Veterans Health Administration medical center . In addition , genetic basis functional capacity disability Veterans affect SZ BP assess , genetic predictor suicidality tardive dyskinesia . Finally , also establish repository allow future genomic study relate SZ , BP , related disorder sequelae .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CSP # 572 - Genetics Functional Disability Schizophrenia Bipolar Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose identify genetic basis Veterans develop either two major psychiatric ( `` mental health '' ) diseases : schizophrenia bipolar disorder . The study also examine genetic basis disability everyday function ( employment , independent living , self care ) among patient . By `` genetic basis , '' mean person 's gene might risk develop illness affect . We compare information gather Veterans illnesses `` psychiatrically healthy '' Veterans . Participants recruit multiple Veterans Health Administration medical center ; analysis blood sample do designate approved laboratory . Both schizophrenia bipolar disorder chronic psychiatric disease associate considerable lifelong disability ; particular , illnesses common Veterans serve Veterans Health Administration . Both condition also know caused part gene so-called heredity ; study entire set human gene ( referred genome ) tool identify specific reason certain people develop certain condition . In addition , patient schizophrenia bipolar disorder often difficulty function real-world-including problem attention memory , ability perform task everyday live normal emotional experiences-and `` functional impairment '' may also inherit genetically . The current study design help identify high risk disease related problem , good method diagnose treat condition develop future . Among aspect schizophrenia bipolar disorder , suicide stand important issue Veterans , family , Veterans Health Administration . Suicide attempts complete suicide common Veterans schizophrenia bipolar illness ( compare Veterans without illness ) , tendency may inherit well . Part study involve determine whether specific gene might associate suicidal behavior . Similarly , study look genetic basis side effect relate take medication disease . For research , participant recruit VA site extensive experience conduct project involve psychiatric disorder . We collect information gene Veterans blood sample , ask question health related factor . We also establish repository allow future genomic study relate SZ , BP , related disorder sequelae . The total study duration indefinite set create SZ BP repository , although required time period address primary aim 3.5 year . Data comparison ( `` reference '' ) group Veterans medical , psychiatric , illness , obtain research initiative entitle `` VA Million Veteran Program '' ( VA-MVP ) . Ultimately , study attempt advance state-of-the-art regard understanding treatment two common mental health disorder affect Veterans also serve part major initiative support `` personalize '' healthcare . It represent major effort link specific gene illness , eventually treatment intend relieve suffering .</detailed_description>
