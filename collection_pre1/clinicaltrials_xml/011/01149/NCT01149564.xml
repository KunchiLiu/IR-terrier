	<brief_summary>Background : Patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) continue one common problem premature infant . Pharmacological closure PDA intravenous ( IV ) indomethacin first report 1976 , however , concern remain regard safety indomethacin , affect renal , GI cerebral perfusion may lead complication transient permanent renal dysfunction , NEC , GI hemorrhage , reduce cerebral oxygenation . Recently , IV ibuprofen show effective closure patent ductus arteriosus premature infant , without reduce mesenteric , renal , cerebral blood flow . We develop echocardiographic PDA flow pattern guide PDA treatment , few dos drug need achieve acceptable closing rate . We also report IV ibuprofen effective IV indometacin PDA treatment extremely premature infant , without increase incidence complication randomise control trial . Several study report oral ibuprofen may effective PDA treatment . To date firm conclusion efficacy safety oral ibuprofen compare IV ibuprofen PDA closure extremely premature infant . Objective : Since efficacy pharmacological closure PDA relate gestational age , extremely premature infant carry high rate mortality morbidity . We intend conduct randomize controlled trial compare oral intravenous ibuprofen treatment PDA high-risk population extremely premature infant . Methods : Extremely premature infant ( gestational age &lt; 28 week ) admit NICU eligible enrollment . Informed parental consent obtain accord Institutional Review Board 's instruction . Extremely premature infant respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) PDA confirm echocardiography randomly assign receive either oral IV ibuprofen . The subsequent dos ibuprofen also determine accord specific echocardiographic PDA flow pattern interval every 24 hour last dose . The dosage oral ibuprofen 10 mg/kg ( 1 ml ) 5 mg/kg 24-hour interval indicate echocardiographic PDA flow pattern . Sample Size Calculation Length Study Period : About 50-60 extremely premature infant admit NICU year . To prove McNemar 's Test one-sided significance level 5 % power 90 % use oral ibuprofen instead IV ibuprofen result comparable PDA closure rate , 31 extremely premature infant RDS PDA enrol . Allowing attrition exclusion final study group , length study period safe set 2 year . Expected Results : We expect determine whether oral ibuprofen effective safe induce PDA closure extremely premature infant compare complication infant treat oral ibuprofen IV ibuprofen .</brief_summary>
