	<brief_summary>Following cryptogenic stroke , many patient nowadays treat percutaneous closure patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) , assume aetiology stroke secondary paradoxical embolism . After PFO closure procedure dual antiplatelet regimen often prescribe 3-6 month several cardiologic neurologic follow-up exam schedule first 12 month follow-up . Usually transthoracic +/- transoesophageal echocardiography ( TTE +/- TEE ) perform 6 month , however kind control systematically perform . In order improve clinical outcome young patient ' population , investigator prospectively perform complete cardiologic neurologic follow-up program patient undergo successful percutaneous closure PFO . The aim control confirm good position PFO-device , confirm absence residual right leave shunt significant atrial arrhythmia Furthermore prospective follow-up analyze possible mechanism lead cerebral stroke recurrence ( e.g . size PFO , presence atrial septal aneurysm , presence residual shunt , size utilized closure device , ... . ) .</brief_summary>
