	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well veliparib without carboplatin work treat patient stage III-IV breast cancer . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether veliparib effective without carboplatin treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib With Without Carboplatin Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy single agent ABT-888 ( veliparib ) ( NSC 737664 ) breast cancer ( BRCA ) carrier metastatic breast cancer base response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct subset analysis BRCA1 vs. BRCA2 hormone receptor status . II . To evaluate progression-free survival patient single-agent ABT-888 . III . To describe safety tolerability ABT-888 ( NSC 737664 ) single agent combination carboplatin BRCA-associated breast cancer . IV . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ABT-888 ( NSC 737664 ) alone combination carboplatin . V. To assess relationship level poly adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) ribose polymerase ( PARP ) inhibition ABT-888 biomarkers deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC 's ) tumor . VI . To explore relationship biomarkers drug effect progression-free survival . VII . To evaluate efficacy safety combination carboplatin ABT-888 patient fail single agent ABT-888 . VIII . To conduct subset analysis BRCA1 vs. BRCA2 hormone receptor status . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 veliparib Arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month .</detailed_description>
