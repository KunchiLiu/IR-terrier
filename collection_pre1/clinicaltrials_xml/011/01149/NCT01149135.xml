	<brief_summary>One frequently investigate hypothesis pathophysiology underlie Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) call winter depression disturbance circadian rhythm . Since circadian system especially sensitive blue portion light spectrum , new light therapy device blue light ( blue enrich polychromatic light ) test efficacy treat SAD . In chronobiological term light hypothesize potent induce non-visual effect . In present study fluorescent tube emit high portion short wavelength light top normal wavelength test superiority treat SAD . This blue-enriched light ( colour temperature 17000 ยบK ) compare standard light treatment ( 5000 ยบ K ) SAD patients. , In early study show therapeutic effect blue enrich light equal standard light treatment use light condition intensity 10 000 lux . In present study , blue enrich light intensity 750 lux use , possible saturation effect former study . The investigator hypothesise blue- enriched light low intensity improve therapeutic effect light treatment lead high response response shorter time schedule compare standard light treatment .</brief_summary>
