	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether insulin treatment pulmonary exacerbation ( PE ) patient Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) normoglycemia improve short term outcome normalize glycemic profile enhance recovery . investigator would like evaluate whether insulin treatment exacerbation improve general clinical condition patient also protect effect ß-cells prevent deleterious effect `` chronic '' hyperglycemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) Exacerbation Insulin Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The life expectancy patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) increase last decade due improve understanding disease new treatment . CF patient live long develop glucose intolerance cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) , fact , routine annual screen Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests ( OGTT ) show prevalence CFRD increase age . CFRD primarily insulinopenic condition characterize impaired delayed insulin secretion , consequence fibrosis exocrine pancreatic tissue compromise ß-cell function . The occurrence CFRD significantly relate increased morbidity mortality . Based data CF Patients Registry USA , mortality rate patient CFRD six-fold high patient without CFRD . Our pilot study prove pulmonary exacerbation ( PE ) , CF patient Normal Glucose Tolerance ( NGT ) exhibit early latent diabetic glucose intolerance Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) become completely normalized 3-4 week resolution PE . These patient consider normoglycemic may experience relatively long period hyperglycemia recurrent event pulmonary infection . Chronically increase glucose value PE adverse impact pulmonary function PE long-term . Hyperglycemia may increase duration extent recovery PE . Furthermore may impair ability overcome lung infection directly stimulate growth respiratory pathogen . Finally , hyperglycemia per-se stressful condition may worsen general outcome . Insulin therapy consider routine treatment patient CFRD . In addition normalize glucose level , insulin beneficial effect general pulmonary function nutritional status , possibly due anabolic effect . No routine formal guideline treat PE hyperglycemia currently available . Normal Glucose Tolerance ( NGT ) patient , hyperglycemic PE , generally intensively treated condition , except treat physician decides interventional insulin treatment . Some patient may experience relatively long period hyperglycemia recurrent event pulmonary infection .</detailed_description>
