	<detailed_description>The symptom heartburn reliable indicator gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) patient would predictably respond acid inhibition . In post-proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) world , neither statement true since many patient present heartburn symptom mediate mechanisms unrelated esophageal luminal acidity , e.g . functional disease , visceral hypersensitivity activation esophageal stretch receptor . Consequently subject fail respond PPIs [ 1-3 ] . Since PPI-responsive PPI-refractory patient heartburn indistinguishable history , difficult determine PPI-unresponsive subject may respond high dos PPI . Additionally , subject respond PPI therapy , symptom response may correlate lesion healing , make systemic marker heal highly desirable . Lesion heal particularly problematic since histopathologic lesion correlate best heartburn presence dilate intercellular space ( DIS ) within esophageal epithelium , detect standard endoscopy , reliably demonstrable perform transmission electron microscopy [ 4-7 ] . Consequently , would desirable objective marker acid-mediated injury esophageal epithelium could identify PPI-responsive heartburn determine heal acid-damaged epithelium non-invasively . DIS esophageal epithelium establish early histopathologic feature gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . This electron microscopic lesion present erosive nonerosive form GERD result acid damage intercellular junctional complex control paracellular permeability within esophageal epithelium [ 8 ] . Further , know treatment PPIs result resolution DIS along heartburn patient erosive nonerosive type GERD [ 9 ] . E-cadherin protein form intercellular adhesive bridge zonula adherens ( ZA ) [ 10 ] ; ZA play integral role maintain integrity tight junction cell loss adhesion bridge molecule e-cadherin result loss barrier function increase paracellular permeability [ 11,12 ] . Therefore , condition acidic refluxate present within esophageal lumen , 'leaky ' junctional barrier promotes excessive entry hydrogen ion acidification intercellular space , turn trigger heartburn activation acid-sensitive neuron within mucosa [ 13 ] . Recently , lab find DIS non-erosive acid-damage ( rabbit ) esophageal epithelium associate Western blot cleavage intercellular portion e-cadherin cleavage occur acid activation endogenous proteolytic process ( unpublished observation ) . Moreover , phenomenon Western blot replicate human esophagus patient GERD , i.e . endoscopic biopsy esophageal epithelium reveal cleavage e-cadherin erosive non-erosive form GERD present within esophageal epithelium healthy subject subject without sign symptom esophageal disease [ 14 ] - see Fig 4 attach poster presentation . Specifically , cleavage e-cadherin GERD patient leave behind within esophageal epithelium cytoplasmic ' C-terminal fragment ( CTF ) ' molecule CTF readily detect Western blot . Interestingly , size CTF consistent , rabbit model , cleavage e-cadherin endogenous matrix metalloprotease . Also noteworthy cleave extracellular component e-cadherin ' N-terminal fragment ( NTF ) ' fragment absorbed blood stream result high serum level NTFs e-cadherin healthy subject detectable use commercial ELISA assay [ 14 ] - see Fig . 6 attached poster presentation . Since CTFs Western blot endoscopic biopsy elevate NTFs e-cadherin ELISA serum reflection acid-injured esophageal epithelium , suggest tantalize possibility sensitive , minimally invasive ( serum ) test esophageal mucosal damage GERD subject . We hypothesize determination either cleave fragment e-cadherin ( serum tissue-based ) discriminate patient acid-mediated heartburn likely PPI-responsive whose heartburn symptom mediate acid PPI-refractory . The hypothesis test determine presence absence CTFs e-cadherin esophageal biopsy measure level NTFs e-cadherin serum endoscopy-negative patient heartburn correlate finding patient 's ( heartburn ) response Kapidex 30 mg 4 week . Based effective heartburn control Kapidex lack thereof , patient classify PPI-responsive PPI-refractory disease , respectively , classification correlate presence absence CTFs pretreatment biopsy pretreatment serum level NTFs e-cadherin . Also , 4 week Kapidex , repeat serum specimens NTFs obtain treated patient determine , marker healing , whether serum level NTFs post-treatment significantly low pretreatment serum level NTFs PPI-responsive heartburn PPI-refractory heartburn . The result study expected show patient PPI-responsive heartburn CTFs e-cadherin tissue high level NTFs e-cadherin serum baseline , level decrease successful PPI therapy . In contrast , symptom PPI-refractory subject acid-mediated , subject expect lack CTFs tissue low level NTFs serum baseline compare PPI-responsive patient , level remain unchanged PPI therapy . Consequently , finding would establish detection cleave fragment e-cadherin tissue blood useful biomarkers disease identify heartburn responsive standard dose Kapidex . The result also expect show patient PPI-responsive heartburn , PPI-refractory heartburn , significant decline level NTFs serum post-treatment low level NTFs expect fall within range control . Consequently , finding would establish detection serum NTFs treatment useful biomarker ( microscopic ) lesion heal PPI-responsive heartburn . Such finding might help select sub-groups appropriate intensive ( high dose ) long term PPI therapy .</detailed_description>
