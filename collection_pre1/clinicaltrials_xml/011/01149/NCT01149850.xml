	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , also work different way kill tumor cell stop grow . Giving bevacizumab together temozolomide may better way block tumor growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab temozolomide together work treat old patient newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Temozolomide Treating Older Patients With Newly-Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall survival elderly subject treat bevacizumab temozolomide newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 12-months survival . II . To estimate progression free survival 2 year progression detect . III . To investigate safety tolerability bevacizumab/temozolomide elderly patient glioblastoma . IV . To isolate DNA , RNA , protein isolated frozen paraffinized archival tumor sample evaluation immunohistochemical pathway profile VEGF-dependent angiogenic pathway , gene expression microarray , MGMT promoter methylation status define important molecule feature treatment response especially age-related molecular expression . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 2 week oral temozolomide day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 4 month .</detailed_description>
