In addition , `` promiscuous exposure '' hepatitis C amongst injection drug user , unusual latter infect G3 well . There several subtypes G3 . Viral genotype long recognize major factor influence response interferon-based therapy . Patients infected G2 G3 respond much well current therapy peginterferon ribavirin infect G1 G4 . Most study group patient G2 G3 together , publish comparison rate viral clearance two favourable genotype . More recently become evident individual chronic hepatitis C , presence insulin resistance , without accompany metabolic syndrome , major factor influence response antiviral therapy CHC . Very recently report confirmed several site worldwide specific polymorphism IL28 gene closely correlate response antiviral therapy genotype 1 CHC .
