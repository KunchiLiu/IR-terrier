	<brief_summary>Anaemia functional iron deficiency common condition Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) patient , condition reduce significantly quality life increase morbidity mortality . Traditionally , Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents ( ESAs ) use , recently use show negative impact overall survival different oncology population . Recently publish data suggest intravenous ( IV ) iron effective anaemia treatment , even without ESAs . This exploratory study first clinical project ferric carboxymaltose ( FCM ) patient MM : data generate may use evaluation drug large population . In study , 1,000 mg IV iron FCM administer day within 24 hour chemotherapy treatment . The primary objective evaluate efficacy FCM give without ESA , correction haemoglobin level subject MM , undergo chemotherapy . Secondary objective aim describe safety tolerability FCM , effect FCM treatment iron status variable MM subject .</brief_summary>
