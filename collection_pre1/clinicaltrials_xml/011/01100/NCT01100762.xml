	<brief_summary>The use low level electrical stimulation apply head , also call transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , test several group researcher see tDCS improve movement person damage brain . The safety potential benefit tDCS child adult patient paralyze brain damage report medical literature . In addition , patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) experience improvement memory report well use hand tDCS . The treatment require put electrode ( pad ) head send small amount electrical current patient may feel `` little tingling '' . Application tDCS take 20 min . In study wish test tDCS application improve step walk ability subject PD improvement walk treadmill . We plan test subject 's ability step pull laboratory test system also test his/her walk ability . There 3 session 7 day apart . In first session subject test treat 20 min tDCS test . In second session subject test walk treadmill 20 min test . In third session subject test walk treadmill 20 min receiving also tDCS test one last time end session . Each session take 2 3 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance non-invasive electrical stimulation technology include transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) provide novel low risk option rehabilitate impaired ability central nervous system ( CNS ) process sensorimotor information . Furthermore , tDCS appear enhance CNS connectivity preliminary evidence indicate patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) may experience improvement work memory , Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale , simple reaction time Purdue Pegboard test . tDCS inexpensive , portable available repeat home use . It may provide long-lasting enhancement cortical activity part tDCS easy administer frequently combine rehabilitation approach include posture gait training . However date , study examine quantitatively effect tDCS posture control walk ability patient PD . As first step plan identify immediate effect tDCS , well add value tDCS treadmill exercise training , improve posture gait individual PD .</detailed_description>
