	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Breast-conserving surgery less invasive type surgery breast cancer may fewer side effect improve recovery . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II clinical trial study well breast-conserving surgery follow radiation therapy work treat patient stage I stage II breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast-Conserving Surgery Followed Radiation Therapy With MRI-Detected Stage I Stage II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate well tumor bed recurrence rate . Patients follow period five year follow completion radiation determine rate . II . To determine cosmetic outcome result breast conserving surgery breast radiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient factor limit patient 's suitability receive breast conserving therapy set multi-centric disease . II . To determine patient satisfaction breast conserve therapy pertain overall treatment experience measure questionnaire . III . To evaluate wound heal overall complication rate radiation component breast conserve therapy . OUTLINE : Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery consist partial mastectomy follow external beam breast radiation therapy 5 day week 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
