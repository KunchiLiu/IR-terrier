	<brief_summary>This single center , prospective , observational study use Gonal-f control ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) subject undergoing ovulation induction/ intrauterine insemination ( OI/IUI ) therapy across Taiwan . It observe previous study COH follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) consider one positive predictor ongoing pregnancy . Many study past tried predict FSH threshold , define FSH dose day follicle &gt; 10 mm diameter , study conduct date determine predictive factor monofollicular development COH IUI cycle . Monofollicular growth contribute significantly reduction multiple pregnancy thus minimize risk associated pregnancy . This study would provide preliminary data factor associate monofollicular development Gonal-f treat cycle use low dose step-up regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predictive Factors Ovarian Response Ovulation Induction With Intrauterine Insemination Gonal-f Low-dose Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ovarian stimulation improve cycle fecundity rate part increase number follicle available fertilisation correct subtle , unpredictable ovulatory dysfunction . Intrauterine insemination establish treatment subfertility due cervical factor , male factor , unexplained etiology . Ovulation induction aim selection single follicle would able reach pre-ovulatory size rupture . The ovarian sensitivity FSH ( FSH threshold ) identify avoid multiple follicular development hence , lowest effective dose FSH use treat infertility . Treatment subject individualise monitor serum estradiol ( E2 ) measurement ultrasound scan ovary assess endometrial thickness . It observe early study OI unexplained non-conception , induction one follicle improve ongoing pregnancy rate increase risk multiple pregnancy . Therefore , reduce number multiple pregnancy , IUI cycle unexplained non-conception , monofollicular growth suggest . The 'low-dose step-up ' protocol suitable method establish appropriate FSH threshold , involve start FSH dose 75 IU/day give 7 14 day . Subsequent dose increment 37.5 IU/day weekly interval determine base ovarian response , usually follicle diameter ≥10 mm see ovary . Human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) inject lead follicle ≥18 mm diameter . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To describe outcome treatment cohort subject undergoing OI/IUI therapy use Gonal-f Secondary objective : - To explore predictive factor ovarian response OI/IUI therapy use low-dose step-up regimen This study plan enrol 30 female subject 1 centre Taiwan . Each subject receive 3 treatment cycle . Before undergo control ovarian stimulation Gonal-f , thorough gynaecologic endocrinologic evaluation subject perform subject give first administration Gonal-f low dose step regimen control ovarian stimulation baseline visit . The objective Gonal-f therapy develop single mature graafian follicle ovum liberate administration hCG . If subject fail respond adequately 4 week treatment , cycle abandon subject would recommence treatment high start dose abandon cycle . If excessive response obtain , treatment would stop hCG administration withheld next cycle treatment would start dosage low previous cycle . Each enrol subject follow confirmation pregnancy status .</detailed_description>
