	<brief_title>The Links Between Water Salt Intake , Body Weight , Hypertension Kidney Stones : Difficult Puzzle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background rationale Nephrolithiasis disease could define social , due widespread distribution continually increase incidence industrialize country high standard living ( 1 ) . In Italy , strike 10 % population , leading expenditure approx . 200 million euro/year hospital admission alone ( 2 ) . Idiopathic Calcium Nephrolithiasis ( ICN ) formation calcium oxalate stone , sometimes mixed calcium phosphate one , common form , incidence roughly 80 % ( 3,4 ) . As regard distribution two sex , slightly high incidence male observe . The pathogenesis ICN involve genetic acquire factor ( 5 ) , combine lead urinary biochemical anomaly lie root stone formation . A high rate calcium-oxalate and/or calcium-phosphate supersaturation lead formation nest crystal grow aggregate form stone . The element urine compound involve process crystallization , whether inhibitor promoter , know urinary stone risk factor . For Ca-oxalate : low urine volume ( &lt; 2 l/day ) , hypercalciuria ( &gt; 250mg/day ) , hyperoxaluria ( &gt; 40 mg/day ) , hyperuricosuria ( &gt; 600 mg/day ) , hypocitraturia ( &lt; 320 mg/day ) hypomagnesuria ( &lt; 50 mg/day ) . For Ca-phosphate , addition above-mentioned factor , hyperphosphaturia ( &gt; 1000 mg/day ) urinary pH also acquire considerable importance : pH &gt; 7 promotes formation stone prevalently compose phosphate , pH 6 7 associated urine volume &lt; 1l/day , dangerously raise Ca-phosphate supersaturation lead formation mixed Ca-oxalate Ca-phosphate stone . Finally , uric acid stone disease element involve hyperuricosuria pH &lt; 5.5 . Among stone risk factor , common find urine patient affect ICN hypercalciuria incidence around 50 % . With regard age onset , two peak , one 20 30 year age one 50 60 . Hypertension obesity also widespread social disease important epidemiological similarity nephrolithiasis . These affinity , year , lead investigator seek interconnection three disease order find common pathogenic moment . As far hypertension concern , various study demonstrate urinary excretion calcium great hypertensives normotensives . A linear association excretion 24-h calcium arterial blood pressure demonstrate numerous study , include INTERSALT ( 6 ) . In 1999 , follow 132 hypertensive 135 control 5 year , group publish paper report onset stone disease hypertensives significantly high percentage compare control , RR 5.5 ( 7 ) . Moreover , year earlier , Madore Curhan publish two study ( 8,9 ) conduct large cohort Americans demonstrate patient past history nephrolithiasis without hypertension prone become hypertensive follow-up non stone former . These result , confirm many subsequent study , however succeed clarify doubt whether hypercalciuria hypertensive predispose development stone disease whether renal damage , albeit microscopic , cause stone disease trigger development hypertension . Scientific literature , however , identify , hypertensive , stone former control alike , linear relationship excretion calcium excretion sodium , calcium dependent variable slope straight line , i.e . increase calcium mmol sodium , much great stone former hypertensives control . Moreover , far back '80s , demonstrate reduction kitchen salt intake 10 g 4 g per day , capacity reduce calciuria reduction calcium intake 1000 mg 500 mg ( 10,11 ) . In 2002 , confirm experimental data paper publish New England Journal Medicine demonstrate recurrent male hypercalciuric stone former follow 5 year , normal calcium , low-salt , low-protein diet power reduce calciuria stone recurrence much significantly low-calcium diet ( 12 ) . Obviously possible separate effect restriction sodium restriction protein . Both diet accompany recommendation drink water , effectiveness already demonstrate first-episode stone former previous study randomize follow-up 5 year conduct 199 stone former 101 control ( 13 ) . The central role body weight determine stone risk clearly describe scientific literature . BMI , weight , abdominal circumference independently associate kidney stone risk ( 14 ) . Nevertheless , mechanisms underlying relation still unknown . Data exist literature suggest body weight affect excretion many promoter inhibitor crystalline aggregation . For example , population study United States demonstrate urine pH inversely correlate body weight urinary excretion calcium , oxalate uric acid increase body weight increase ( 15,16 ) . Notwithstanding data , effect body weight excretion many urinary stone risk factor remain partly unknown ; due limit weight category , low number obese people study population , absence control group `` non stone former '' failure record food intake study publish . In addition , regard urinary excretion , evaluation excess weight solely basis BMI value abdominal circumference may seem somewhat reductive . It would appear useful ass body composition , lean mass , fat tissue mass mineral mass . In way , good stratify obesity class , might become simple understand intricate endocrine/metabolic change occur obesity ( hyperinsulinism , hyperestrogenism etc . ) establish good correlation urinary excretion stone risk factor . In fact , study ( 16 ) demonstrate slight increase total incidence stone disease female obese patient compare male , slightly high mean age female , case , age equal , low number recurrence female compare male . These phenomenon probably affect concentration serum estrogens transformation fatty tissue adrenal androgen estrogens ; nonetheless effect serum estrogen urinary excretion calcium unknown . Finally , study demonstrate body weight also affect composition stone . In fact , demonstrate incidence uric acid stone higher overweight/obese patient normal weight patient ; study highlight patient idiopathic uric acid nephrolithiasis high BMI hyperuricosuric patient form calcium oxalate stone . The pathophysiological link seek hyperinsulinism : fact insulin resistance associate decrease production renal ammonia lead consequent decrease urinary pH , characteristic uric acid stone disease ( 17 ) . This theory indirectly corroborate aforementioned indirect relationship BMI 24-h urine pH find also age-related reduce urinary acidification capacity increase risk uric stone disease , irrespective body weight . On basis , clear presence excess weight/obesity , uric acid mixed stone disease could raise suspicion Metabolic Syndrome : , however , conclusive study , neither effect stone risk arterial blood pressure water therapy low-salt diet population overweight/obese stone former sufficiently study . In final analysis , nephrolithiasis , arterial hypertension excess weight/obesity prove closely interconnect possible develop target diet aim reduce risk illness death disease . Among dietary approach , reduction sodium chloride food , increased hydration increase intake food alkaline potential ( 18 ) seem play important role . For many year , research unit involved project , partially finance Italian Ministry University Research ( MIUR ) , gear towards study effect induce dietary change patient calcium stone disease . The aim present project deepen knowledge relationship stone disease , hypertension , body weight water salt intake general population area Parma , historically gastronomic tradition normal diet tends high salt content , select population stone former hypertensive . Experimental design/description methodology As already mention , aim project attempt clarify relationship idiopathic calcium stone disease , salt water intake , hypertension body weight . The study divide two sub-projects : 1 . Assessment salt water intake general population area Parma ( duration 24 month ) 2 . Assessment effect low salt + water therapy diet vs water therapy alone one year patient idiopathic calcium stone disease , male female , normal- hypertensive without treatment ( duration 12 month ) At least 350 healthy control , 100 hypertensive non stone former without treatment , 150 normotensive stone former 100 hypertensive stone former without treatment enrol study . Both control stone former subdivide accord 4-class BMI scale . The class follow characteristic : Class 1 BMI £ 18.9 ( underweight condition ) ; Class 2 BMI 19 24.9 ( normal weight condition ) ; Class 3 BMI 25 29.9 ( excess weight condition ) ; Class 4 BMI &gt; 30 ( obesity ) . The patient enrol medical history record subject measurement anthropometric parameter arterial blood pressure , stone risk mini-profile drawn include volume , creatinine , sodium , potassium calcium measure accord method publish . As well-known , 24-h urinary sodium consider `` gold standard '' assessment food-related salt intake , creatinine sensitive marker lean mass , potassium index body 's alkaline potential calcium important pathophysiological role describe . The stone former randomize receive low salt+water therapy diet water therapy alone , one year . The term `` water therapy '' refers abundant intake water low mineral low sodium content ( least 2 litre winter 3 summer ) . For stone former , end 12 month period therapy , anthropometric parameter arterial blood pressure measure urinary mini-profile repeat . Objectives Sub-project 1 ) `` Assessment salt water intake general population area Parma '' Primary objective To assess consumption kitchen salt ( NaCl ) water intake general population area Parma adjustment BMI , study possible relationship presence arterial hypertension . Secondary objective 1 . To study urinary sodium-calcium relationship general normo- hypertensive population without treatment . 2 .
