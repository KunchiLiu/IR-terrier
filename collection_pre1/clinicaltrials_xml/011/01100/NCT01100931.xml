	<brief_summary>Background : - Carboplatin-paclitaxel commonly use chemotherapy combination advance non-small-cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) solid tumor . In randomized clinical trial , combination carboplatin , paclitaxel , additional chemotherapy drug bevacizumab good response rate survival compare carboplatin paclitaxel alone . However , trial treat patient specific diagnosis treatment risk . Further research need determine whether combination useful diagnosis . - YM155 drug target type chemical often find cancer cell . It investigate several phase I phase II clinical trial , show well tolerate moderately effective treating advance NSCLC patient respond well one two standard treatment . Objectives : - To determine efficacy combination carboplatin , paclitaxel , YM155 treatment non-small-cell lung cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma solid tumor standard therapy likely effective . Design : - Before start study , participant screen medical history , blood test , image scan affected area , tumor biopsy , test direct study doctor . - Participants treat six 21-day cycle , 18 week treatment . Each cycle include blood test image study require . - On day 1 cycle , participant receive infusion paclitaxel carboplatin , follow 4-day infusion YM155 ( portable electronic infusion pump ) . - Participants compute tomography scan imaging every cycle ( approximately every 6 week ) determine whether therapy affect cancer site . - After sixth cycle , participant return follow-up visit least every 3 month , ask remain contact researcher allow study long-term effect treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study Paclitaxel , Carboplatin YM155 ( Survivin Suppressor ) Subjects With Solid Tumors ( Phase I ) Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma ( Phase II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Treatment platinum-based doublet chemotherapy result median survival 7 10 month patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . - Carboplatin-paclitaxel commonly use regimen advance NSCLC solid tumor . In randomized clinical trial carboplatin , paclitaxel plus bevacizumab result improved efficacy ( response rate survival ) compare carboplatin paclitaxel alone patient non-squamous histology consider low risk bleeding treat . Improvement survival confirm another randomize study different chemotherapy backbone . - Novel treatment strategy need develop advanced NSCLC . - YM155 transcriptional inhibitor survivin , inhibitor apoptosis protein . Pre-clinical activity YM155 observe several solid tumor , include NSCLC model synergy observe combination chemotherapeutic drug , include carboplatin paclitaxel . - YM155 investigate several phase I phase II clinical trial show well tolerated common toxicity report reversible grade 1 -2 severity . In addition , monotherapy YM155 alone show modest antitumor activity phase II trial advance NSCLC patient fail one two prior chemotherapy line . Primary Objectives : - In Phase I portion study primary objective determine safe tolerable phase II dose YM155 base upon dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) YM155 administer 72 hour continuous intravenous infusion ( CIVI ) every 3 week combination paclitaxel carboplatin . - In Phase II portion study primary objective determine objective response rate ( ORR = partial response ( PR ) + complete response ( CR ) ) YM155 combination carboplatin paclitaxel first line treatment patient advance NSCLC . Secondary Objectives : - In Phase I portion study secondary objective determine preliminary activity combination regimen base upon response rate measure response evaluation criterion solid tumor [ RECIST ] . - In Phase II portion study secondary objective determine median progression free survival ( PFS ) , median overall survival ( OS ) safety tolerability combination regimen patient population . - To assess expression particular gene pretreatment tumor pre/post treatment serum sample evaluate treatment effect correlate clinical outcome . Eligibility : Phase I - The phase I portion trial open patient recurrent advanced cancer ( NSCLC solid tumor ) standard therapy offer curative potential also patient carboplatin / paclitaxel regimen consider standard care . Patients receive one previous chemotherapy regimen . Phase II - Pathologically confirm stage IIIB ( malignant pleural effusion ) intravenous ( IV ) recurrent NSCLC . - No previous chemotherapy advance lung cancer . - Adequate organ bone marrow function . - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0-2 . Design : - Open label phase I/II trial - Following Simon two-stage optimal design</detailed_description>
