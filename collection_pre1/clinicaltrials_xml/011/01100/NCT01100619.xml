	<brief_summary>The primary objective clinical study determine whether inhibition cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) isozyme CYP2C8 XL184 observe vitro preclinical study translate potential clinically significant drug-drug interaction human . The study measure effect daily dose XL184 pharmacokinetics ( PK ) rosiglitazone . The PK XL184 combine rosiglitazone evaluate well . A specific objective study determine whether interaction XL184 drug rosiglitazone sufficiently large enough necessitate dosage adjustment use combination XL184 , whether interaction would require additional therapeutic monitoring . Rosiglitazone , commonly know Avandia , prescription medicine approve FDA use treat adult Type 2 ( adult-onset non-insulin dependent ) diabetes mellitus ( high blood sugar ) . In study , subject take 2 dos rosiglitazone . There intention therapy result take rosiglitazone study .</brief_summary>
