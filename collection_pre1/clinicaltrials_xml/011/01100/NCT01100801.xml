	<brief_summary>This open , non-randomized , multicenter Phase II study evaluate cisplatin plus TS-1 oxaliplatin plus TS-1 first-line therapy predict 'responder ' platinum fluoropyrimidine . This study plan 3 center Singapore Korea . A total 30 subject enrol treatment arm . Each center recruit 15-25 subject predict 'responder ' platinum fluoropyrimidine . The study consist prescreening period , screen period treatment period . A fresh tumour biopsy sample obtain prescreening period gene expression profile . As genomics guide trial , obtain tissue biopsy vital conduct trial . Patients primary situ ( requirement entry trial ) , endoscopic biopsy perform prior 1st cycle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Genomic-guided 'Standard-of-care ' Chemotherapy Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer world 's second leading cause cancer death . For patient unresectable disease recurrent disease surgery , main therapeutic option chemotherapy . Chemotherapy improve survival quality life patient advance disease compare best supportive care alone . Despite large number randomize trial , consensus best agent regimen . In general , combination chemotherapy regimens provide high response rate single agent , however , translate modest improvement outcome trade increase treatment toxicity . The key challenge manage patient advanced gastric cancer identify appropriate drug patient might benefit palliative chemotherapy . Gastric cancer heterogeneous disease differ chemosensitivities anti-cancer drug . Current selection standard therapy often empirical . Gene expression profile show capability dissect heterogeneity allow sub-classification risk-stratification cancer accord biological feature clinical outcome . Utilising gene expression data couple in-vitro , in-vivo clinical response data promise strategy may enable clinician match right drug right patient . The purpose study : 1 . Assess feasibility genomic-guided therapy 2 . Evaluated treatment response standard-of-care chemotherapy enrich patient group define 'responder ' base genomic-guided therapy</detailed_description>
