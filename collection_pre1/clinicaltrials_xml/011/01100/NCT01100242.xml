	<brief_summary>This open label , non-randomized , single arm phase II study . The primary objective study investigate efficacy combination sorafenib VELCADEÂ® ( bortezomib ) . The primary efficacy endpoint Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) . The secondary objective study : Assess response rate combination patient population Assess toxicity combination patient population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Velcade Sorafenib Unresected Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Pretreatment , complete history physical examination include performance status , weight concurrent non-malignant disease therapy do start treatment . Prior surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy detail note . - Prior initiation treatment , laboratory study include CBC differential cell count , platelet count , urinalysis , complete metabolic profile , magnesium electrocardiogram . A baseline imaging study tumor perform . Other X-rays do clinically indicate . - Physical examination , performance status toxicity record do course therapy . - During study , patient follow complete blood count ( CBC ) , differential platelet count day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Chemistries also perform course within 3 day leeway prior treatment . Clinical schedule consider schedule patient treatment , specimen collection processing , specimen shipment . - Measureable evaluable disease evaluate image study do baseline every 2 course thereafter determine tumor response . - For patient warfarin , International Normalized Ration ( INR ) test perform prior first cycle , weekly first cycle , prior day one subsequent cycle INR acceptable range first cycle . If INR acceptable range first cycle , INR monitor weekly value stable three consecutive measurement one week apart . - Since Sorafenib competitive inhibitor cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) patient assessed cycle medication change diet would affect CYP3A4 metabolism .</detailed_description>
