	<brief_summary>Background : - Tumors thymus rare treat surgery , often difficult determine whether thymic tumor malignant base biopsy alone long-term survival rate le 50 percent . Because thymic tumor rare , treatment knowledge come relatively small series case , choice treatment usually depend hospital clinic staff 's experience familiarity give chemotherapy surgery regimen . - Belinostat investigational anticancer drug yet approve Food Drug Administration use cancer . Researchers interested determine whether belinostat combine conventional chemotherapy safely effectively treat advanced thymic cancer . Objectives : - To determine safe tolerable dose belinostat give combination cisplatin , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide . - To determine belinostat ( combine abovementioned standard chemotherapy regimen ) effective thymic cancer cell . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose advanced recurrent thymic malignancy consider curable surgery radiation therapy , receive previous chemotherapy treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , blood test , image study direct study researcher . - Participants receive six 21-day cycle ( 18 week ) treatment belinostat combination cisplatin , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide . The treatment require continuous infusion 3 day , participant remain treatment center time . Participants regular blood test , clinic visit , image study treatment period . - Participants complete six treatment cycle severe side effect may offer option continue treatment belinostat alone . - After 18-week study period , participant return regular follow-up exam least 4 week , ask remain contact study researcher year continue study long-term effect ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1/2 Study PXD101 ( Belinostat ) Combination With Cisplatin , Doxorubicin Cyclophosphamide First Line Treatment Advanced Recurrent Thymic , Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - New option treatment patient advance thymoma thymic carcinoma need . - Belinostat , N-hydroxy-3- ( phenylsulphamoylphenyl ) acrylamide , hydroxamic acid deacetylase inhibitor able inhibit histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDAC ) Class I II enzymes . - An ongoing phase II study belinostat recurrent metastatic thymic malignancy show activity warrant consideration belinostat first line . - Belinostat alteration target protein level due gene expression change may allow increased sensitivity cancer cell conventional chemotherapy . Objectives : Primary Objectives - In Phase I portion primary objective determine safe tolerable phase 2 dose , dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) preliminary activity combination belinostat continuous intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( CIVI ) cisplatin , doxorubicin cyclophosphamide patient advance thymic malignancy . - In Phase II portion primary objective determine clinical response rate ( partial response ( PR ) +complete response ( CR ) ) belinostat combination cisplatin , doxorubicin cyclophosphamide first line treatment patient advance thymic malignancy . Secondary Objectives - To determine time response , duration response , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . - To determine toxicity profile safety combination . - To assess exploratory correlative marker relation response treatment ( immunohistochemistry array Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( CGH ) ) Eligibility : - Patients histologically confirm advanced thymic malignancy chemotherapy na ( SqrRoot ) . - Measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria - Adequate renal , hepatic hematopoietic function Design : - The Phase I portion study consist four dose level dose escalation follow accord traditional 3 patient cohort . - Once maximum tolerated doe determine , phase II portion study begin . - Belinostat give 48h CIVI start day 1 , doxorubicin slow intravenous ( IV ) injection day 2 3 , cisplatin infuse 1 hour day 2 cyclophosphamide slow IV infusion Day 3 . - Treatment give every 21 day 6 cycle disease progression . Treatment belinostat alone may continue disease progression .</detailed_description>

Patients must chemotherapy na ( SqrRoot ) treatment advanced thymic malignancy . 3 . Age &gt; 18 year . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) . 5 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL platelet &gt; 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less equal 5 time institutional upper limit normal evidence metastatic disease liver less equal 3 time institutional upper limit normal without evidence metastatic disease liver creatinine less equal 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 45 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal . 7 . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . 8 . Patients must recover toxicity relate prior therapy ( surgery radiation ) grade le equal 1 must least 28 day since prior radiation major surgery . Target lesion select within previously irradiate area , newly arise clearly progress irradiation proven repeat scan . 9 . Concurrent corticosteroid myasthenia gravis , paraneoplastic syndrome , chronic condition allow . Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect potential affect activity pharmacokinetics belinostat cisplatin , doxorubicin cyclophosphamide determine follow review case Principal Investigator . Efforts make switch patient brain metastasis take enzymeinducing anticonvulsant agent medication . 10 . The effect belinostat develop human fetus unknown . For reason histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDAC ) inhibitor well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 11 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman race ethnic group eligible trial EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients major surgery radiotherapy within 3 week enrollment . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 1 month without steroid may enrol discretion principal investigator . 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition belinostat agent use study . 5 .
