	<brief_title>Combination Decitabine Midostaurin Patients Older Than 60 With Newly Diagnosed Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development primarily outpatient treatment option AML also capable provide significant disease control priority clinician . To address need less toxic , effective treatment old patient AML , purpose Phase 1 single institution study evaluate safety efficacy midostaurin decitabine administer combination . Decitabine epigenetic modifier gene expression show well-tolerated population dose schedule propose study , reasonable efficacy . Although precise mechanism action incompletely understood , postulated work reactivate expression key tumor suppressor gene silence tumor cell reverse pattern hypermethylation promotor element . Midostaurin oral agent show inhibit FLT3 kinase preclinical vitro vivo study , well clinically patient ITD TKD FLT3 mutation ( FLT3mut ) . Both directly indirectly , midostaurin also potently inhibit multiple molecular target think important pathogenesis AML . These target include VEGFR-1 , VEGF receptor ; c-kit ; H- K-ras ; well multidrug resistant gene , MDR . The addition midostaurin decitabine regimen previously establish efficacy tolerability allow u evaluate hypothesis two drug believe work distinct mechanism action may act together improve response patient treated decitabine alone , without significant additional toxicity .</detailed_description>
