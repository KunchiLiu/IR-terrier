	<brief_title>Efficacy Erlotinib Neoadjuvant Setting Patients With Stage IIIA , N2-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It widely accept patient locally advance non-small cell lung cancer would better outcome neoadjuvant therapy follow surgery surgery alone . However standard treatment option still unclear . Erlotinib ( Tarceva® ) oral inhibitor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase anti-neoplastic effect approve especially woman , patient adenocarcinoma , non-smoker Asian population . Moreover malignant tissue EGFR mutation , efficacy know enhanced . So expect population , patient locally advance , N2 positive , erlotinib would beneficial conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy safety convenience neoadjuvant therapy .</detailed_description>
