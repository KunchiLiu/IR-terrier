	<brief_summary>Background : - At present time , drug prove work patient papillary kidney cancer spread ( metastasize ) beyond kidney . Researchers interested determine whether combination drug bevacizumab erlotinib use treat metastatic papillary kidney cancer . - Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Carcinoma ( HLRCC ) inherit type papillary kidney cancer ( run family ) . Papillary kidney cancer also occur sporadically , without family connection . More research need determine whether treatment papillary kidney cancer , bevacizumab erlotinib , work inherit sporadic type kidney cancer , , whether difference . Objectives : -To determine effectiveness combination bevacizumab erlotinib treatment patient ( 1 ) metastatic HLRCC kidney cancer ( 2 ) metastatic kidney cancer associate HLRCC ( sporadic papillary RCC ) . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose papillary kidney cancer spread beyond kidney . - Participants may either HLRCC sporadic papillary kidney cancer . Design : - Participants screen full medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , CT scan evaluate tumor size treatment option . - Participants receive 28-day treatment cycle bevacizumab ( give intravenously every 2 week ) erlotinib ( tablet take mouth daily ) . - Every cycle , participant return regular blood urine test . Every cycle , participant image scan assess tumor size response treatment . Female participant uterine fibroid tumor related kidney cancer may additional scan assess tumor size response treatment . - Participants continue receive treatment study tumor grow spread new area ( disease progression ) , intolerable side effect develop , well treatment option become available , study close , unsafe continue treatment , participant decides remain study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Bevacizumab Erlotinib Subjects With Advanced Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Cancer ( HLRCC ) Sporadic Papillary Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Cancer ( HLRCC ) familial cancer syndrome characterize propensity develop renal cancer , uterine cutaneous leiomyomas.The kidney cancer associate HLRCC associate HLRCC clinically aggressive characterize unique histopathologic feature sometimes describe type2 papillary RCC . - Germline mutation fumarate hydratase ( FH ) genetic hallmark HLRCC . Mutational inactivation FH show result VHL-independent upregulation hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) downstream transcriptional target . - The recognition HIF upregulation may play important role formation propagation renal cancer associate HLRCC suggest intervention direct component pathway , VEGF TGF-alpha/EGFR , may benefit patient population . - We propose test hypothesis dual VEGF/EGFR blockade bevacizumab/erlotinib likely clinically active patient HLRCC associate RCC well sporadic papillary sporadic RCC . Objective : Primary Objective -To determine overall response rate ( RECIST ) patient 1 ) metastatic RCC associate HLRCC 2 ) metastatic sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary renal cancer treat combination bevacizumab erlotinib Eligibility : - Diagnosis advance RCC associate HLRCC ( cohort1 ) sporadic/non-HLRCC papillary RCC ( cohort2 ) - ECOG PS 0-2 - Measurable disease - No history major bleeding , recent active myocardial ischemia , GI perforation , cerebrovascular accident significant intercurrent illness - No coagulopathy bleeding diathesis - No recent surgery ( &lt; 4 week inadequately heal surgical scar ) - Adequate organ function : - Adequate liver function ( total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL &lt; 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) subject Gilbert disease , AST/ ALT less equal 2.5 time ULN ) - Adequate renal function ( creatinine less equal 2.0 time ULN creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min ) - Neutrophils &gt; 1500/microL platelet &gt; 100,000 - No brain metastases - No 2 prior regimen contain VEGF-pathway inhibitor ; prior bevacizumab - Ability understand sign inform consent Design : - Patients receive fix dose bevacizumab ( 10mg/kg IV every 2 week ) erlotinib ( 150mg/day po ) . Dose reduction drug interruption unacceptable toxicity allow . - Patients evaluate response every 8 week use RECIST criterion - The study base open label Simon two-stage minmax design stratify two cohort , 1 ) cohort 1- patient HLRCC , 2 ) cohort 2-patients sporadic papillary RCC . In cohort , 13 patient accrue first stage accrue maximum 20 patient . Accrual analysis two cohort independent . - Following completion accrual cohorts 1 2 , study expand include two additional cohorts- Cohort 3 ( HLRCC patient Cohort 4 ( patient sporadic/non HLRCC papillary RCC ) good estimate overall response rate perform additional exploratory biomarker analysis . Up 20 additional evaluable patient include cohort .</detailed_description>
