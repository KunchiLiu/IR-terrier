	<brief_summary>The overall goal study investigate whether modulatory effect probiotic , use food supplement ( Lactobacillus GG market Culturelle yoghurt ) gastrointestinal tract promote restoration intestinal function enhance specific immune response child cryptosporidial rotaviral infection South India . Rotavirus Cryptosporidium spp . important viral parasitic cause gastroenteritis child south India . Both infection lead severe dehydrate gastroenteritis young child specific treatment . Repeated episode diarrhea result long term deleterious effect nutritional status , possibly due intestinal damage . Most episode infectious gastroenteritis resolve without specific therapy , mainstay treatment rehydration . However , oral rehydration remain under-utilized , part due lack effect frequency bowel movement duration illness . Due interest simple , safe effective measure ameliorate long-term effect diarrheal illness , grow appreciation potential certain microorganism offer direct benefit health host . Probiotics know beneficially modulate several host function , important immune response intestinal barrier integrity . The investigator propose build investigator previous collaborative effort conduct pilot study provide mechanistic understanding effect probiotic supplementation child rotaviral cryptosporidial diarrhea . Based establish efficacy LGG treatment variety diarrheal disease document modulation immune response strengthen intestinal epithelial barrier function probiotic , investigator propose conduct Phase I/II double-blind randomize placebo control clinical trial ass preliminary efficacy safety LGG vs. placebo resolution symptom restoration intestinal function child either rotaviral cryptosporidial diarrhea detect enteric infection . Promising result Phase I/II study provide preliminary data power future randomize trial critical outcome follow rotaviral cryptosporidial infection .</brief_summary>
