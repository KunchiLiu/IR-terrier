	<detailed_description>Investigational Medical Product : Tamiflu® 75 mg hard capsule Objective : The main purpose study assess potential neonatal exposure oseltamivir lactation examine oseltamivir concentration maternal blood , urine , breast milk/colostrum . Study design : Single-country , multicenter , observational pharmacokinetic study Enrolment follow-up : Lactating woman ( 20 subject ) present clinical symptom indicative influenza recruit ( maximum 6 month period recruitment ) receive immediate treatment oseltamivir ( Tamiflu® 75 mg hard capsule , provide free charge study ) standard dose 75 mg twice daily . These subject 12 hour pharmacokinetic plasma , urine breast milk study undertaken steady state oseltamivir concentration ( active inactive metabolite measure ) reach blood , i.e . three day treatment . Subjects need laboratory confirmation influenza infection inclusion study , although result virological test seek confirm influenza infection record . Maternal venous blood ( 2 sample , one pre-dose sample one 2.5-hours-after-dose sample ) , urine sample ( obtain total urine output within 12 h ) , breast milk/colostrum sample ( 8 sample within 12 h ) take determine oseltamivir phosphate ( inactive metabolite ) oseltamivir carboxylate ( active metabolite ) level . Safety : Adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) record . SAEs report Ethics Committee Regulatory authority accord reporting requirement Hungary . Number patient : A total 20 lactate patient enrol . Number centre : Up 3 investigational site Hungary participate study . All site belong academic institution .
