	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate difference long-term outcome sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) patient screen percutaneous nerve evaluation ( PNE ) first stage tined lead procedure ( TLP ) . Furthermore , want evaluate outcome patient respond screen TLP failure initial PNE . Materials method : We evaluate patient screen eligibility receive SNM treatment since introduction tin lead technique centre 2002 . In May 2009 , implant patient ask keep voiding diary record effect SNM urinary symptom . Success define 50 % improvement least one relevant void diary parameter compare baseline . Chi square analysis use evaluate difference long-term outcome separate screening method . Results : In total , 92 patient screen SNM . Of 76 patient screen PNE , 35 ( 46 % ) meet criteria permanent implantation , whereas 11 16 patient ( 69 % ) underwent direct screening TLP permanent stimulators place . Of 41 patient fail PNE subsequently underwent screen TLP , 18 ( 44 % ) implant INS show successful response . The mean follow-up 53 month ( range 35-77 month ) time void diary analysis . Statistical analysis show difference type screen long-term success ( p=0.94 ) . Conclusion : Although first stage TLP reliable screen tool PNE , long-term success rate seem dependent screening method . Furthermore , patient initially fail PNE respond prolonged screening TLP , appear least successful long-term patient directly respond PNE TLP .</detailed_description>
