	<brief_summary>For several year interest people HIV-1 progress slowly disease longer survival without Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ( HAART ) others . The investigator others identify HIV positive individual control viral load many year without HAART , rare individual lose HIV-1-specific cellular immune response , important control viral load . This group refer long-term non-progressors ( LTNP ) . Unlike LTNP majority HIV-1 infected individual chronic progressors ( CP ) make effective HIV-1-specific cellular immune response , even HAART . We propose use novel DNA vaccine boost immune base therapy ( cytokine hormone ) try regenerate miss HIV-1-specific cellular immune response make chronically infect HIV-1+ person like LTNP . By inject novel DNA vaccine immune base therapy people already infect HIV-1 , immune system may stimulate mount great immune response vaccine also real HIV-1 particle HIV-1-infected cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise , Phase I , open label comparative study run 52 week ( 2 screen visit 2 week apart follow 48 week study ) . 50 patient screen initial phase 30 clade B infected individual randomise study , consist 3 arm : Arm 1 ascertain vaccine safety toxicity presence cytokine/hormone therapy . Arm 2 identify vaccine safety toxicity . Arm 3 indicate safety toxicity cytokine/hormone therapy . The target patient chronically HIV-1 clade B infect person nadir CD4 T-cell count &gt; 200 cells/ul blood start ART . The current CD4 T-cell count &gt; 400 cells/ul blood . Patients may receive ART length time , currently receive NNRTI boosted-PI base HAART , viral load level detection ( 50 copies/ml plasma ) . Patients bleed two occasion commence IBT regimen , order establish baseline , regular interval thereafter ( week 0,1,2,4,6,8,12,16,24 48 ) . The treatment regimens consistent previous finding animal model suggest administration IL−2 antigen−specific T−cell contraction phase immune response ( 8 15 day post−vaccination ) may preserve lengthen clinically relevant response . Furthermore study man demonstrate IL−2 administer immunisation ART−treated HIV−1−infected patient increase specific lymphoproliferation T cell . Recent preliminary study HIV−1−infected individual use tetanus vaccine investigator show IL−2 administer immunisation may effective inducing sustain tetanus−specific response IL−2 administer immunisation together immunisation . The dosage use study base use previous pilot study administration IL-2 + GM-CSF rhGH level drug show positive effect immune response demonstrate clinical benefit whilst level safe well tolerated HIV-1 positive individual . The dosage vaccine base previous study dosage level show induce immune response although response transient . In summary investigator aim increase survival vaccine responses administration cytokines/hormones boost memory response round immunisation .</detailed_description>
