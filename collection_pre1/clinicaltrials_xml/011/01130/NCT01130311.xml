	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis global public health problem . One third world 's population infect tuberculosis ( TB ) almost 2 million death per year globally . According WHO , Pakistan rank 8th amongst 22 high TB burden country , estimate prevalence 263 case /100,000 population . In spite effective therapy drug sensitive TB , treatment failure occur frequently leading concern emergence multi-drug resistant ( MDR ) extensively drug resistant ( XDR ) mycobacterial strain . Therefore recent year , interest generate regard role adjuvant immunomodulating therapy treatment TB . WHO classify tuberculosis disease severity 3 distinct category ; mild , moderate severe accord clinical presentation host factor . Severity disease link mycobacterium genotype host factor vitamin D deficiency Vitamin D hormone produce body response sun exposure . Independent 's effect bone mineralization , vitamin D recognize numerous immune modulating effect ; specific mycobacterium tuberculosis . Therefore vitamin D may enhance host immune response pathogen . Vitamin D status accurately determine measure serum level 25- ( OH ) D3 . A recent systemic review meta-analysis explore association low serum vitamin D risk active tuberculosis conclude patient tuberculosis low serum level vitamin D healthy control match sex , age , ethnicity , diet geographical location . Vitamin D deficiency life threaten condition . It usually unrecognized present generalize 'aches pain ' due osteomalacia . The recommended dose treatment vitamin D deficiency 200,000 IU/ month 50,000 IU/ week , give 2 month serum vitamin D level &gt; 30 ng/ml . Bone mineral density change usually complete 10 week treatment . The investigator hypothesize replace vitamin D patient active pulmonary tuberculosis , 'Time Recovery ' shortened.Our aim determine whether replace patient insufficient deficient level vitamin D affect clinical outcome disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis Tuberculosis ( TB ) global emergency . In 2004 , estimate 8.9 million new case 1.7 million death due disease1 . In Pakistan , pulmonary tuberculosis ( TB ) major public health problem . The population Pakistan 160,943,000 estimate prevalence case tuberculosis 263/100,000 , incidence smear positive pulmonary TB 181/100,000 , mortality 34/100,0002 . The management TB remain complicated issue even availability effective anti-tuberculous drug . One important aspect issue difficulty clinician ' face measure clinical response patient , especially smear-negative pulmonary extra-pulmonary disease . Christian et al 3. recently develop validated simple clinical score evaluation TB patient . The score base eleven clinical variable , obtain WHO clinical manual TB . These include self-reported parameter ( e.g. , cough , hemoptysis , dyspnoea , chest pain night sweat ) , sign comprise anemic conjunctiva , tachycardia , positive finding lung auscultation , axillary temperature &gt; 37.0˚C , body mass index ( BMI ) middle upper arm circumference ( MUAC ) . Each variable contributes 1 point , except BMI MUAC contribute 2 point , give maximum score 13 . Using , score patient divide 3 severity class , provide easy tool clinical follow prognosis . Vitamin D Vitamin D normally synthesize skin influence sunlight ingest , It readily metabo-lized liver form 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) , accepted measure vitamin D status . 25 ( OH ) D metabolize 1 hydroxylase enzyme biologically active metabolite , 1 , 25 dihy-droxyvitamin D ( 1 ,25 [ OH ] 2D ) 4,5 . Activated vitamin D circulate bind protein enters target cell interact nuclear receptor . This complex combine retinoic acid X receptor form heterodimer , turn interacts Vitamin D response element target gene . By increase in-testinal calcium phosphate absorption6 , increase renal calcium reabsorption , enhance PTH-mediated bone resorption ( via effect RANKL ) , vitamin D net effect increase serum cal-cium phosphate concentration . Additionally , vitamin D receptor element present multiple gene , vitamin D receptor many organ , 1-alpha hydroxylase activity occur extrarenal tissues7 . These local tissue effect responsible non-mineral-related effect vitamin D ; cell differentiation proliferation immune regulation8 . Vitamin D deficiency The two common cause vitamin D deficiency remain decreased intake vitamin D contain food reduce sun exposure . The major source vitamin D exposure sunlight , anything diminishes transmission penetration solar UVB skin affect cutaneous synthesis vitamin D3 . Vita-min D deficiency therefore occur people live without sun exposure ( include whose skin constantly protect sun protective clothing , indoor life style sunscreen use. ) . In addition , food naturally contain vitamin D food fortify vitamin D often inadequate satisfy vitamin D requirement . Serum level less 20 ng/mL ( 50 nmol/L ) 25-OH vitamin D commonly accept cutoff vitamin D deficiency , whereas level 20 30 ng/mL ( 50 75 nmol/L ) , consider insufficiency9,10 . Asymptomatic minimally symptomatic vitamin D deficiency increasingly recognize around world . In Pakistan , number small study identify high prevalence vitamin D deficiency pa-tient population include present hip fracture , obstetric case attend ambulatory care clinic . Risk factor include history poor nutrition , lack exposure sunlight , low socioeco-nomic status . Zuberi LM et al11 report 92 % outpatient present AKUH , vitamin D defi-cient ; 62 % severe , 24 % moderate 8 % mild deficiency . Almost half patient ( include severe deficiency ) asymptomatic . Two separate study center involve healthy , as-ymptomatic volunteer identify high prevalence vitamin D deficiency ( unpublished data ) . Baig MA et al12 , study outpatient two public hospital Karachi , identify 92 % patient vitamin D deficient severe form D deficiency see patient tuberculosis . Vitamin D Replacement Nutritional deficiency ( 25OHD &lt; 20 ng/ml [ 50 nmol/L ] ) require treatment 600,000 IU/month 50,000 IU/week ) 13 . In study plan give 600,000 IU/month 2 month . Repeat test vitamin D perform 8 week . If level &lt; 30ng/ml treatment repeat 2 month . Vitamin D replacement generally safe . Toxicity , development hypercalciuria hypercal-cemia occurs 25OHD level 88 ng/ml ( 220 nmol/L ) 14,15 . In 1997 , National Academy Sci-ences define Safe Upper Limit vitamin D 2000 U/day14 new data however indicate high dos safe least several-month period16 . The benefit vitamin D replacement occur gradually ; one study , skeletal effect see upto 10 month 5 week course therapy17 . Vitamin D Tuberculosis Clinical study suggest vitamin D enhance antimycobacterial immunity , deficiency associate susceptibility active disease18,19 . High dos vitamin D widely use treat active TB pre-antibiotic era . More recently , case-control study demonstrate vegetarian diet ( low vitamin D ) independent risk factor active TB South Asians18 patient TB Gujarati Hindu ethnic origin significantly high rate vitamin D deficiency ethnically match tuberculin-positive TB contact . Similarly , Gibney et al , document gradation vitamin D level African immigrant Aus-tralia , patient latent TB low level compare control , patient active past history active TB level lower latent infection20 . A recent systematic review meta-analysis 21explored association low serum vitamin D risk active tuberculosis con-cluded patient tuberculosis low serum level vitamin D healthy control match sex , age , ethnicity , diet geographical location . 1 ,25 ( OH ) 2D direct antimycobacterial action , induce antituberculous activity vitro monocytes macrophages22.Several mechanism action propose . Exogenous 1 ,25 ( OH ) 2D in-duces superoxide burst23 enhance phagolysosome fusion Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macrophage ; phenomenon mediate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , suggest response initiate bind membrane vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) 24.1 ,25 ( OH ) 2D also modulate immune response bind nuclear VDR , up-regulates protective innate host response , include induction nitric oxide synthase25.Recently , 25 ( OH ) D also show support messenger RNA induction antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin LL-37 , possess antituberculous activity26 . Although association vitamin D deficiency tuberculosis document epidemiological clinical study , causal role yet verify . Interestingly isoniazid rifampicin therapy show decrease vitamin D level , raise question whether low vitamin D level could consequence disease27 . Additionally , affect replace vitamin D prevention treatment tuberculosis study systematic manner . There , therefore , need randomize controlled trial evaluate effect vitamin D supplementation antimycobacterial host response clinical recovery . Immune responses Mycobacterium tuberculosis Restriction infection M. tuberculosis dependent effective macrophage activation facilitate recruitment leucocyte site infection . The protective role CD4+ , IFN-γ produce T cell confirm acute chronic mycobacterial infections28 . Macrophage TNFα play critical role granuloma formation restriction disease relate pathology29 . TNF-α IFN-γ activate granu-loma formation C-C family chemokines , CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL4 , CCL5 C-X-C chemokine family ; CXCL8 , CXCL9 , CXCL10 CXCL1230 . Chemokines play critical role determine activation migration pattern circulate monocyte blood . CXCL9 early predictive marker IFNγ secrete cell , find increase re-sponse M. tuberculosis antigen stimulation . CCL5 IFNγ-induced CXCL10 also contribute granu-lomatous response31 . Previous study show utility mycobacterial antigen , RD1 antigens early secrete activate T cell ( ESAT ) 6 investigate specific immune response individual infect M. tuber-culosis . Specific immune profile show present TB patient coordinate disease status32,33 . A study household contact TB patient show dynamic cytokine response mycobacterial antigen drive IL10 central protection , development M. tuberculosis infection , peak inflammatory cytokine response 6 month present individual develop disease34 . We show circulate CXCL9 level TB patient differ accord severity disease35 . In addi-tion , mycobacterial antigen induce CXCL9 response correlate IFNγ , great local-ised compare disseminated disease36 . A recent study also show relevance use CCL2 ( MCP-2 ) CXCL10 ( IP-10 ) biomarkers tuberculosis37,38 . In study hope determine immune parameter patient prior post-vitamin D treatment .</detailed_description>
