	<brief_title>Does Coffee Consumption Prevent Shorten Postoperative Ileus After Colon Resection ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent evidence show multimodal rehabilitation program accelerate recovery GI function colon resection . 8 A multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , phase 3 trial demonstrate Alvimopan , peripherally act mu-opioid receptor antagonist , appear accelerate GI tract recovery 1 day , reduces postoperative ileus-related morbidity without compromise opioid analgesia . 9 Asao et al demonstrate gum chew accelerate recovery GI function , also 1 day , abdominal surgery . 10 Epidural anesthesia show shorten duration POI , well improve pain control , decrease pulmonary complication , quicken recovery time . However , appear reduce overall length stay . 4 However , Neudecker et al . unable reproduce result previous trial evaluate effect thoracic epidural analgesia duration postoperative ileus follow laparoscopic sigmoid resection . 11 Given conflict data , one single measure adopt prevention POI . Recent evidence show coffee may stimulant GI Tract . A small study 16 healthy volunteer demonstrate coffee appear increase rectal tone thus imply impact defecation mechanics.12 Furthermore , several study demonstrate caffeinated coffee stimulant motor activity colon.13,14 Given potential pro-motility property GI tract , seem reasonable postulate coffee , commonly consume product general public , may play role shorten possibly prevent POI . This directly impact overall patient satisfaction reduce length stay overall hospital cost .</detailed_description>
