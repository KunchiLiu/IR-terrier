	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating SCIO Biofeedback Device 's Ability Increase Body Wellness After One 45-minute Session</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective Study determine one 45-minute treatment SCIO ( Scientific Consciousness Interface Operations System ) biofeedback device would show change , hopefully improvement , person 's Body Wellness indicator define follow introduction hypothesis . There three ( 3 ) hypothesis objective study define Hypothesis # 1 , Hypothesis # 2 Hypothesis # 3 . Introduction # 1 : The body electrical process require volt amp conduct resistance circuit operate . All muscle turn electrical impulse . Muscles magnetic use volt amps operation . The brain massive collection cell electrical activity measure via EEG ( electroencephalography ) . The heart large electro-magnetic engine use electrical impulse influence muscle heart circulate blood . Most EEG ( electroencephalography ) , ECG ( electrocardiography ) EMG ( electromyography ) measure concerned oscillatory property concern volume basic amperage circuit . The collective baseline circuit EEG ( electroencephalography ) , ECG ( electrocardiography ) , EMG ( electromyography ) GSR ( galvanic skin response ) measurement give u rating global body voltage , body amperage skin resistance ( V=voltage , A=amperage , R=resistance respectively ) . There norm V ( voltage ) , A ( amperage ) R ( resistance ) certain people , due stress factor , low V ( voltage ) , A ( amperage ) and/or R ( resistance ) . Hypothesis # 1 : Our hypothesis measure calculate Voltage , Amperage Resistance , administer one 45-minute treatment SCIO ( Scientific Consciousness Interface Operations System ) stress reduction electro-stimulation biofeedback , Voltage , Amperage Resistance rectify . Our scale 0-110 V , A R measurement , improvement Body Wellness indicator go towards high end scale . Introduction # 2 : The collective inductance capacitance change body reflection redox potential reflect hydration ( H ) oxygenation ( O ) index . Hypothesis # 2 : It also hypothesis study hydration ( H ) oxygenation ( O ) index affect one 45-minute treatment stress reduction electro-stimulation biofeedback SCIO . Our scale 0-110 H O measurement , improvement Body Wellness indicator go towards high end scale . Introduction # 3 : Irregularities EEG , EMG , ECG GSR correct guide electro-stimulation . The V A also greatly affected charge stability free proton electron , ( negative charge positive charge body ) , collectively make proton pressure ( P ) electron pressure ( E ) . The acidity-alkalinity balance electrical measure amount positive versus negative charge particle . This measure carbon base electrode SCIO electro-stimulation biofeedback . Hypothesis # 3 : It hypothesis , proton pressure ( P ) electron pressure ( E ) score improved one 45-minute treatment SCIO . The scale normal P 75 scale normal E 65 score show improvement Body Wellness indicator change towards number . Together , item voltage ( V ) , amperage ( A ) , resistance ( R ) , hydration ( H ) , oxygenation ( O ) , proton pressure ( P ) electron pressure ( E ) form term VARHOPE . These VARHOPE score essential body functioning , therefore overall hypothesis within one 45 minute session , measurable improvement Body Wellness indicator achieve .</detailed_description>
