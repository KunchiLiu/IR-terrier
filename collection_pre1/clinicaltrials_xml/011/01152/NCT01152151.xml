	<brief_title>Point Of Care Testing In Danish General Practice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Point-of-care testing ( POCT ) increasingly use general practice assist GPs management patient diseases . An accredited external quality assessment ( EQA ) program internal quality control system recommend . In Copenhagen area external well internal quality control enforce annual outreach consultant visit split sample EQA procedure , POCT result compare central laboratory result . However , adherence quality guideline see less anticipated among GPs Copenhagen municipality former county Copenhagen . Dissemination guideline alone rarely brings improvement clinical practice even multifaceted implementation guideline may change clinical practice . Multiple strategy implement guideline appear effective single one 5 ; 6 . However , well-designed empirical research look various implementation strategy still need area . E-mails successfully use several study promote health behaviour change risk population hypothesis electronic reminder letter ( send GPs electronic patient record ) efficient inexpensive way influence behaviour GP 's . Due low adherence , Copenhagen General Practitioners ' Laboratory ( CGPL ) plan introduce electronic reminder letter ( alongside standard implementation procedure ) 2010 order increase adherence quality guideline . The aim study : To evaluate effect electronic reminder letter versus postal reminder letter general practice adherence clinical quality guideline regard POCT . Participants All practice conduct POCT INR ( Approximately 240 practice ) . Practices allocate usual CGPL quality guideline activity postal reminder letter ( postal reminder group ) usual CGPL implementation activity addition electronic reminder letter ( electronic reminder group ) . Data collection Data perform split test EQA procedures retrieve CGPL database . These data contain patient relate data split test EQA conduct constructed identification code . Process indicator ( sent reminder letter ) also obtain CGPL . The Capital Region databases provide information participate practice correspond GPs . Data The Capital Region Information regarding : Sex , age , year graduation university , work address , type practice , patient list practice use follow test : Hemoglobin , glucose , INR ; CRP , HbA1C retrospectively collect 4 month start trial ( tentative order establish baseline ) . Every month rest study period investigator receive data Capital Region regard practice study area identify practice use Hemoglobin blood glucose POCT . These data compare CGPL database every month practice do split sample EQA receive electronic reminder letter follow 4 month . Randomization : Practices stratify area type organization mean SAS ( Proc PLAN ) independent organization . Outcome : Primary outcome : 1 . Total number split test perform study period ( three period ) . Secondary outcome : 2 . Proportion practice high quality test define 75 % performed split test INR within accept interval accord CGPL quality guidelines1 study period . 3 . Proportion practice conduct split test study period . Power calculation : The investigator use 50 % adherence estimate base CGPL data 2007 order ascertain power study . Given MEREDIF 25 % power 90 % estimate 160 practice include study . Statistics : Differences outcomes allocation group baseline , intervention outcome period test mean chi-square test ( outcomes 2 3 ) t-tests ( outcome 1 ) . In order investigate development adherence relative intervention investigator three period use logistic ( outcome 2 3 ) linear ( outcome 1 ) regression investigator use GEE method account repeated measurement . To identify predictor adhere guideline adjust odds ratio practice characteristic estimate multivariate logistic ( outcomes 2 3 ) linear ( outcome 1 ) regression analysis outcomes baseline . All statistical analysis perform use SAS , version 9.2 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) . Intervention Standard implementation The standard implementation EQA consist invited meeting annual facilitator visit practice . As part plan implementation strategy GPs invite meeting , receive write material CGPL . At start practice receive write information KPLL emphasize need adhere EQA . Postal reminder letter In group , postal reminder letter send practice adhere guideline recommendation split test within 30 day ; i.e . reminder letter send CGPL database register last split test last reminder letter 31 day ago . Thus , practice may receive four postal reminder letter : Electronic reminder letter In group , electronic reminder letter send practice adhere guideline recommendation split test within 30 day ; i.e . reminder letter send CGPL database register last split test last reminder letter 31 day ago . Thus , practice may receive four electronic reminder letter : Time table Substudy A Jan - Apr 2010 Sep - Dec 2010 Jan - Apr 2011 Baseline Intervention Outcome</detailed_description>
