	<brief_title>Point Of Care Testing In Danish General Practice - Part II</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Point-of-care testing ( POCT ) increasingly use general practice assist GPs management patient diseases . An accredited external quality assessment ( EQA ) program internal quality control system recommended1 . In Copenhagen area external well internal quality control enforce annual outreach consultant visit split sample EQA procedure , POCT result compare central laboratory result . However , adherence quality guideline see less anticipated among GPs Copenhagen municipality former county Copenhagen . Dissemination guideline alone rarely brings improvement clinical practice2 even multifaceted implementation guideline may change clinical practice 3 ; 4 . Multiple strategy implement guideline appear effective single one 5 ; 6 . However , well-designed empirical research look various implementation strategy still need area 7 . E-mails successfully use several study promote health behaviour change risk population 8 ; 9 hypothesis electronic reminder letter ( send GPs electronic patient record ) efficient inexpensive way influence behaviour GP 's . Due low adherence , Copenhagen General Practitioners ' Laboratory ( CGPL ) plan introduce electronic reminder letter ( alongside standard implementation procedure ) 2010 order increase adherence quality guideline . The aim study : To evaluate effect electronic reminder letter general practice adherence clinical quality guideline regard POCT . To evaluate legacy effect potential effect reminder letter ( i.e . impact intervention stop ) . Participants Included study , approximately 320 , GP practice conduct POCT least four POCT ( either haemoglobin glucose ) 4 month study period conduct INR analysis ( define four less test 4 four month period ) . These practice identify GP database Capital area CGPL . Data collection Data perform split test EQA procedures retrieve CGPL database . These data contain patient relate data split test EQA conduct constructed identification code . Process indicator ( sent reminder letter ) also obtain CGPL . KvEAP Capital Region databases provide information participate practice correspond GPs . Data The Capital Region Information regarding : Sex , age , year graduation university , work address , type practice , patient list practice use follow test : Hemoglobin , Glucose , INR ; CRP , HbA1C retrospectively collect 6 month start trial ( tentative order establish baseline ) . Each month remainder study period investigator receive data Capital Region regard practice study area identify practice use Hemoglobin blood Glucose POCT . These data compare CGPL database every month practice do split sample EQA receive electronic reminder letter follow 6 month . Randomization : Practices stratify area type organization mean SAS ( Proc PLAN ) independent organization . Practices allocate usual CGPL quality guideline activity ( control group ) usual CGPL implementation activity addition electronic reminder letter ( intervention group ) . Outcome : Primary outcome : 1 . Total number split test perform study period Hemoglobin Glucose . Secondary outcome : 2 . Proportion practice high quality test define 75 % performed split test Hemoglobin Glucose within accept interval accord follow CGPL quality guidelines1 study period . 3 . Proportion practice conduct split test Hemoglobin Glucose study period . Power calculation : The investigator use 10 % adherence estimate base CGPL data 2007 order ascertain power study . Given MEREDIF 15 % power 90 % estimate 274 practice include study . Statistics : Differences outcomes allocation group baseline 6 month follow-up test mean chi-square test ( outcomes 2 3 ) t-tests ( outcome 1 ) . In order test development adherence relative intervention investigator 3 data collection point use logistic ( outcome 2 3 ) linear ( outcome 1 ) regression investigator use GEE method account repeated measurement . To identify predictor adhere guideline adjust odds ratio practice characteristic estimate multivariate logistic ( outcomes 2 3 ) linear ( outcome 1 ) regression analysis outcomes baseline . All statistical analysis perform use SAS , version 9.2 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) . Intervention Standard implementation The standard implementation EQA consist invited meeting annual facilitator visit practice . As part plan implementation strategy GPs invite meeting , receive write material CGPL . Electronic reminder letter Electronic reminder letter send practice adhere guideline recommendation split test within 30 day ; i.e . reminder letter send CGPL database register last split test last reminder letter 31 day ago . Thus , practice may receive 4 electronic reminder letter period : After 4 month cross-over apply , practice allocate control group receive electronic prompt prompt cease intervention group . This follow-up act investigate legacy effect intervention . The main hypothesis first 4 month intervention also show effect 4 month beyond intervention period .</detailed_description>
