	<brief_title>HOME Study : Hysteroscopic Office Myomectomy Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one hundred subject enrol randomize , comparative setting study conduct 10-15 investigational site . Sixty subject randomize undergo treatment office setting , 40 subject randomize undergo treatment hospital ambulatory surgical center ( ASC ) set . Subjects undergo hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure remove intrauterine polyp , type 0 fibroid , type I fibroids . Saline infused sonohysterogram image ( SIS ) obtain three month post treatment compare pre-treatment image , determine percent reduction target pathology volume . Additionally , subject self-reported pain score ( rat 11 point scale ) compare pain occur treatment procedure average pain level experience PAP smear . Economic data collect compare two treatment setting .</detailed_description>
