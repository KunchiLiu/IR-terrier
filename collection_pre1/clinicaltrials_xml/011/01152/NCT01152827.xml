	<brief_summary>- According Martin F et al , AKT highly phosphorylated phenochromocytoma benign adrenocortical tumor . - In nonfunctioning carcinoid , PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activate . - Although mTOR clearly attractive therapeutic target tumor , clinical study mTOR inhibition RAD001 conduct pheochromocytoma extra-adrenal paraganglioma non-functioning carcinoid . - So design phase II study RAD001 pheochromocytoma extra-adrenal paraganglioma non-functioning carcinoid evaluate efficacy RAD001 orphan disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although several therapeutic option exist patient metastatic pheochromocytoma , option limit cure . Reduction tumor size palliates symptom , survival advantage debulking unproven . A reduced tumor burden facilitate subsequent radiotherapy chemotherapy . External-beam irradiation bone metastases radio frequency ablation lesion treatment alternative . Chemotherapy combination cyclophosphamide , vincristin , dacarbazine provide tumor regression symptom relief 50 % patient , response usually short-lived . To date , 131I-labeled MIBG therapy single valuable adjunct surgical treatment malignant pheochromocytoma . As single agent , 131I-labeled MIBG limit efficacy cure , consensus dos use treat either bone organ metastasis . Multicenter study require reach consensus efficacy high-dose versus fractionate medium dos 131I-labeled MIBG monotherapy versus combination therapy radio nuclides mode chemotherapy . The PI3-K/Akt/mTOR pathway dysregulated many cancer activate several upstream protein , ra , TCL1 , bcr-abl , membrane receptor tyrosine kinase , include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , platelet-derived growth factor receptor , c-kit , Flt3 . Increased expression constitutive activation catalytic subunit PI3-K Akt and/or decrease absent PTEN protein expression report many type cancer . Activating mutation PIK3CA , gene catalytic subunit PI3-K report 25 % gastric cancer . Upstream growth-promoting pathway converge mTOR critical molecule often deregulate cancer . These deregulate molecule precede inappropriate signal activate mTOR switch , drive growth proliferation cancer cell . Because number potential defect cause inappropriate activation mTOR large one another common cancer cell , block effect point convergence rational approach . According Martin F et al , AKT highly phosphorylated phenochromocytoma benign adrenocortical tumor . Although mTOR clearly attractive therapeutic target tumor , clinical study mTOR inhibition RAD001 conduct pheochromocytoma extra-adrenal paraganglioma . So conduct phase II study RAD001 disease And also include nonfunctioning carcinoid study .</detailed_description>
