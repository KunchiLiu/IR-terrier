	<brief_summary>Great controversy exist feasibility safety product employ self-directed cholesterol reduction . The position self-directed cholesterol lowering could lead need low cholesterol take product likely unfounded . This convincing evidence suggest cholesterol level low low one would beneficial conversely dangerous . Ample evidence exists cholesterol cause cardiovascular disease lower cholesterol place individual population low risk . Because high cost , insurance concern suboptimal access physician care , self-directed , effective safe approach cholesterol maintenance reduction would desirable . Drug therapy also associate suboptimal result . Though new concept address cholesterol several mechanism simultaneously show consistently effective good tolerability , still need self-directed cholesterol optimize alternative . It , therefore , intent study evaluate certain food , specifically nutraceutical contain fruit flavor drink hope proven safe effective alternative approach cholesterol management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Of Nutraceutical Drinks For Cholesterol ( Evaluating Effectiveness Tolerability )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholesterol principle component cardiovascular disease . It deposit wall blood vessel contribute chronic vascular insufficiency manifest claudication , ischemic ulceration , angina , acute vascular insufficiency present heart attack , stroke sudden death . Coronary heart disease number one killer worldwide . Approximately 50 % male one-third female develop coronary heart disease relate acute event lifetime . The cost coronary heart disease stagger . In United States alone , $ 120 billion spend annually direct indirect cost attribute killer ( 10 ) . The Framingham Heart Study show coronary heart disease incidence rise proportionately serum cholesterol ( 1 ) . More importantly , numerous study demonstrate reduction coronary heart disease related event fall cholesterol level treatment ( 18 ) . There four class commonly use cholesterol lower drug : 1. statin 2. fibric acid derivates 3. niacin 4. bile acid sequestrants . Of , widely use statin . Statins produce potent LDL lowering , reduce cardiovascular event , relatively safe . However , despite proven effectiveness relative safety , even statins limitation . First , many 30 % people take statin develop myalgia . Second , many drug interaction exist . Third , LDL lower see low dose , make up-titration limited value ( 3 ) ( 20 ) . With fibrates , niacin , bile acid sequestrants , tolerability even problematic titration , end point data somewhat weak statin , especially monotherapy ( 4 ) ( 7 ) ( 14 ) ( 17 ) . Beyond efficacy safety limitation select drug , socioeconomic barrier effective cholesterol lower . Although people cognizant importance cholesterol reduction , many evade doctor/patient relationship cost . Others like , forget take , difficulty swallow pill . Some access health care , drug plan , lack financial mean afford pharmaceutical . Furthermore , high cholesterol represent label might adversely affect one 's ability procure inexpensive life health insurance . Therefore , need alternative cholesterol lower approach circumvent limitation . In devise approach , crucial incorporate relatively new concept cholesterol lower and/or maintenance . Recently , become apparent target single mechanism , either absorption endogenous production cholesterol , may augment potentially compensatory mechanism , thus decrease effectiveness type monotherapy . Hence , raise dose one medication may enhance toxicity proportion gain efficacy . To effective without substantial toxicity , several medication active ingredient low cholesterol via different mechanism employ simultaneously . The rationale application test proven combination statin/niacin therapy ( 12 ) ( 15 ) ( 22 ) also combination statin/phytosterol therapy ( 16 ) . In case , reduction combination therapy great expect sum reduction constituent , thereby , allow low dos drug low toxicity compare single drug therapy ( 21 ) . There several non-pharmaceutical product available public cholesterol lower property ; L-carnitine vitamin C two example , substance think completely safe low dose range show effective cholesterol lower . L-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transfer intracellular mitochondrial metabolism , remove cholesterol blood thereby reduce serum cholesterol . Though side effect rare dose relate , lower seizure threshold patient history seizure report ( 5 ) ( 8 ) . Vitamin C statin-like HMG-coA reductase inhibitory activity , unlike statin , lower cholesterol without raise LPa deplete Co-enzyme Q-10 ( two counterproductive effect statin ) . Vitamin C show completely safe dosage 3 gram per day ( 9 ) . Co-Q-10 demonstrated mitigate side effect statins ( myalgia ) depletion may reduce cardiac muscle function . Side effect Co-Q-10 rare usually involve skin irritation minor GI side effect ( 19 ) . Red Yeast Rice Chinese dietary supplement available flavor color agent century . It known contain least nine different statin well phytosterols . Thus , decrease body 's synthesis cholesterol absorption . Though form augment Lovastatin content illegal United States , naturally ferment product available legally health food store promote favorable cholesterol level . The red coloration may also stimulate appetite hence compliance food dietary supplement contain . Though Red Yeast Rice , general , well-tolerated , headache , GI side effect , muscle pain weakness , liver abnormality dizziness rarely report . The psychological benefit enhance compliance red coloration Red Yeast Rice may augment L-carnitine , show stimulate mild sense euphoria ( 2 ) ( 11 ) . Niacin B vitamin lower LDL triglycerides raise HDL , part , decrease hepatic release lipoproteins bind cholesterol . Though comparatively high dos niacin often need low LDL , beneficial effect HDL realize low dos . Though great 2 gram , predominantly long-acting niacin formulation , associate side effect include flushing , GI side effect , hyperglycemia , gout , abnormal liver function myopathy . Very low dos niacin well-tolerated ( 22 ) . Phytosterols natural plant product low cholesterol compete cholesterol absorption intestine ( 13 ) . The data support cholesterol reduction cardiovascular health improvement strong FDA allow product contain sufficient quantity phytosterols make special claim concern cardiovascular benefit ( 6 ) . Very well-tolerated , 3 gram per day , think essentially devoid side effect ( 13 ) . An ideal cholesterol lower product would prove effective , minimal side effect . It would require one take pill , would preferably liquid form suspension soluble drink . It would contain multiple active ingredient would work different mechanism different site allow low side effect profile synergistic efficacy .</detailed_description>
