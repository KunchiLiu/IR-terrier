	<brief_title>Bendamustine Bevacizumab Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Bendamustine design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cancer cell . Bendamustine also interfere creation new DNA , may keep cancer cell repair form new cancer cell . Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient need tumor growth , may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Bevacizumab long FDA approve treat breast cancer . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level bendamustine base join study . Up 4 dose level bendamustine test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose bendamustine find . All participant receive dose level bevacizumab . Study Drug Administration : You receive bendamustine vein 30-60 minute Days 1 2 28-day study cycle . You receive bevacizumab vein Days 1 15 cycle . The first time receive bevacizumab , give 90 minute . If tolerate well , rest dos give 30-60 minute . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - Women able become pregnant urine pregnancy test . Every 2 cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn test tumor marker . - A chest x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan , and/or PET/CT scan perform check status disease . These scan also perform time doctor think need check status disease . If study doctor think best interest , type scan list may also perform . Length Study : You may continue take study drug combination long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Follow-Up Visit : Six ( 6 ) week stop take study drug combination reason , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT scan , MRI scan , PET scan and/or PET/CT scan perform check status disease . If study doctor think best interest , type scan list may also perform . This investigational study . Bendamustine FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphoid leukemia non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic colorectal cancer , non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , type brain cancer call glioblastoma multiforme . The use drug combination advance cancer investigational . Up 55 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
