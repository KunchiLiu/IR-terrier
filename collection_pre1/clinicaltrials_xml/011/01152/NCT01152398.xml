	<brief_summary>The current trial , BNIT-BR-003 , evaluate safety biological activity fix dose MVA-BN®-HER2 follow adjuvant chemotherapy patient HER-2-positive breast cancer . The intent vaccination induce combine antibody T-cell anti-HER-2 immune response , intend target HER-2-expressing tumor cell , may induce tumor regression slow progression disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MVA-BN®-HER2 candidate breast cancer immunotherapy product comprise highly attenuated non-replicating vaccinia virus , MVA-BN® , engineer encode modify form HER-2 protein . MVA-BN® well-characterized , clonal strain modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) develop smallpox vaccine , suitable use high-risk ( e.g. , immunocompromised ) individual . MVA-BN®-derived vector encode heterologous antigen develop use vaccine infectious disease HIV , treatment cancer . A large database exist safety evaluation animal human MVA-BN® , MVA-BN®-derived vector . HER-2 overexpressed 20-30 % human breast cancer . It oncogene/growth factor receptor critical malignant phenotype HER-2- expressing tumor . It immunogenic target , immune response protein show mediate potent anti-tumor activity multiple animal model . Means stimulate anti-HER-2 reactivity study clinically . Sponsor , collaborator , others use Protein DNA vaccine form HER-2 , safety database develop significant adverse event result HER-2 directed vaccination . MVA-BN®-HER2 encodes modify form HER-2 protein , hereinafter refer HER2 . HER2 contain extracellular domain HER-2 lack intracellular , cell signal domain . In addition , HER2 include two universal T-cell epitope tetanus toxin facilitate stimulation immune response HER-2 , self-protein . The current trial , BNIT-BR-003 , evaluate safety biological activity fix dose MVA-BN®-HER2 follow adjuvant chemotherapy patient breast cancer overexpress HER-2 . Patients receive 6 subcutaneous vaccination 4-week interval blood draw immune function analysis .</detailed_description>
