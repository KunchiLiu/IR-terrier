	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : To know utility manual lymph drainage ( MLD ) part Physical Complex Therapy turn relevant exclusive dedication supposes therapist . To date , evidence-base MLD limit two study analyze relevance . The first study measure effect compression bandage without MLD . The group receive compression MLD significant reduction limb volume decrease pain , despite fact MLD give one week ( Johansson et al. , 1999 ) . A study investigated effect eight session MLD two week 42 woman breast cancer-related lymphoedema , finding suggest MLD contribute significantly oedema reduction , although MLD course relatively short study group limit mild moderate swelling ( 20-30 % difference ) . Information quality life , use questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30 gather result consider final assessment ( Andersen Cabbage 2000 ) . Similar study would provide comparative enlighten information regard previous result . The investigator could determine MLD , spite obtain improvement volume lymphoedema , provide benefit reduction symptom relate . The investigator hypothesize MLD contribute significantly volume limb reduction provide clinical improvement regard quality life accord questionnaire EORT QLQ-C30 . For calculation sample size investigator depart follow assumption : The effect standard treatment control group control produce average volume limb reduction 5 % . The effect treatment experimental group average 25 % ( minor difference effect would indicate discreet effect test treatment ) . The investigator also assume , standard deviation similar group near 25 % . With information alpha risk 0.05 power 0.80 calculation sample size 20 patient every group . Considering rate withdrawal 30 % every group , appropriate sample size 58 patient assign two group 29 patient . Main aim : To analyze effectiveness Manual Lymph Drainage ( MLD ) treatment postmastectomy lymphoedema order reduce volume lymphoedema Secondary aim : To analyze duration reduction lymphoedema time . To analyze improvement concomitant symptomatology lymphoedema use result two quality life test validate Spanish : EORTC QLQ-C30 version 2.0 , cancer general EORTC QLQ-BR23 specifically breast cancer . In particular , item refer upper extremity ( 47 , 48 , 49 ) corporal image ( 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 ) high score worse result . Methodology : Researching Project methodology randomize , control clinical trial . Group A Control : patient standard treatment ( care skin , exercise measure compression -bandage one month later sleeve compression ) . Group B Experimental : patient standard treatment ( care skin , exercise measure compression ( bandage one month later sleeve lymphoedema ) addition receive Manual Lymph Drainage Main variable : Volume reduction affect arm treatment express percentage . Number patient : 58 woman .</brief_summary>
