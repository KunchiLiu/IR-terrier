	<brief_summary>With development recombinant gonadotrophin , use human source protein production hormones become unnecessary . These protein , find urinary preparation , think cause local , post-injection adverse event ( AEs ) subject . There demand physician alternative urinary product treatment . Due allergy urinary product , personal reason , subject able willing treated protein human origin . This study allow subject treat recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin ( r hCG ) ( free urinary protein ) , otherwise would possible . The study sponsor use opportunity collect additional safety data new recombinant product , ( Ovidrel , r-hCG ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label , Canadian Phase IIIb Study With Ovidrel Ovulation Induction ( OI ) Assisted Reproductive Technique ( ART )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one ten couple reproductive age experience infertility . Infertility may cause problem men , woman . A number technique use depend duration type infertility problem . The treatment ovulation induction ( OI ) use help exogenous gonadotrophin follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) hCG order stimulate follicle release oocytes fertilization fallopian tube . Assisted reproductive technology ( ARTs ) , include in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intra- cytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , increase chance success obtain one embryo . In order obtain one embryo , necessary stimulate growth maturation several follicle . Such multiple follicular development obtain daily administration follicle stimulate hormone ( r-hFSH , Gonal-F ) . When follicle reach large enough size , role hCG achieve final oocyte maturation initiation follicular luteinization . Serono International S.A. develop pharmaceutical preparation human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) clinical use application recombinant DNA technology . The result product choriogonadotrophin alpha , pure recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin ( r-hCG ) . The corresponding drug product market tradename Ovidrel . Ovidrel ( choriogonadotrophin alpha injection ) approve United States , European Union Australia . OBJECTIVES The objective study collect safety information order confirm already know profile r- hCG ( Ovidrel ) .</detailed_description>
