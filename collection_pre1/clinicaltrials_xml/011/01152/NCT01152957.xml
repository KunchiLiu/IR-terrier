	<detailed_description>Disparities epidemiology cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk factor among Latinos extensively describe ; however , traditional medical model CVD risk reduction effective Latinos . One promising strategy use community-based community health worker ( CHWs ) . CHWs long use Latin-America integral part health care delivery system . Further , preliminary data prior pilot diabetes self-management CHW program show improvement lipid . However , lack effectiveness data study use rigorous experimental design , adoption CHW model quite limited locally nationally . In MHHI , goal examine effectiveness CHW intervention CVD risk reduction among Latinos . We propose examine effectiveness multilevel CHW intervention adjunct routine primary care reduce CVD risk factor among diabetic Latinos Miami . The UM Jay Weiss Center substantial experience Community Health Worker Program take lead role development implementation intervention CHW program . The study design randomize control trial ( RCT ) 300 Latino patient age 35-70 poorly control diabetes ( AIC &gt; =8.0 ) follow Ambulatory Care Clinic ( ACC ) Jackson Memorial Hospital ( JMH ) . Primary Objective : To determine CHW intervention result lower CVD risk factor include blood pressure , LDL cholesterol , diabetes control ( AIC ) measure Total Framingham Risk Score ( FRS ) . Secondary Objectives : To determine CHW intervention result improvement follow putative mechanism may influence FRS : 1 . Medication adherence ( measure validate instrument ) 2 . Improvements diet exercise ( measure validate instrument ) ; Hypotheses : Among patient receive care ACC hypothesize compare enhance usual care , patient randomize CHW intervention 18 month : 1 . Greater reduction blood pressure low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) 2 . Improved glycemic control 3 . Greater rate medication adherence ( take &gt; 80 % specified medication dos ) 4 . Increases physical activity ( kcal/week ) 5 . Increases mean number daily vegetable consume The CHW intervention involve 4 ( require ) home visit , 10 group session , 10 follow-up phone call per subject 12-month time period . The primary outcome HgA1C ; secondary outcome include LDL level , systolic diastolic blood pressure . Baseline follow-up data medication adherence , medication intensification , diet exercise also collect . The control group continue receive usual care primary care physician . We enhance usual care patient receive provide three set educational material publish NIH .</detailed_description>
