	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) represent `` gold standard '' current management patient acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . Indeed , PPCI associate rapid restore coronary flow well outcome compare pharmacological therapy . However sizable proportion patient PPCI achieve epicardial coronary artery reperfusion myocardial reperfusion , condition know no-reflow . A series consistent data clearly show no-reflow strong negative impact outcome , negate potential benefit PPCI . No-reflow may cause variable combination 4 pathogenetic component : 1 ) distal atherothrombotic embolization ; 2 ) ischemic injury ; 3 ) reperfusion injury ; 4 ) susceptibility coronary microcirculation injury . In particular PPCI embolus different size originate fissurated atherosclerotic plaque occlude microvascular bed . Several pharmacological , mechanical technical strategy propose prevention treatment distal embolization coronary no-reflow variable result , data address possible effect different stent design distal embolization thrombotic fragment . Coronary stent divide open cell close cell stent accord design . Typically , number arrangement bridge connector differentiate open-cell closed-cell design . If adjacent ring segment connect every possible junction , design classify closed cell . If connect junction point remove , design classify open cell . Such design inherently allow flexion adjacent ring , few connection point allow great flexion conformability . The flexion benefit open-cell design cost scaffolding uniformity , scaffold benefit closed-cell design cost flexion conformability . A previous study , perform patient underwent carotid stenting , show significant reduction distal embolization associate use close cell stent compare open cell stent . However study compare open close stent design percutaneous coronary intervention particularly condition high risk embolization acute myocardial infarction . STUDY HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES The aim study determine whether close cell stent design may reduce distal embolization reflow PPCI acute STEMI compare open cell stent design . The study population include consecutive patient admit hospital acute STEMI treat PPCI within 12 hour symptom onset . METHODS Design This study prospective , randomized trial . Patient selection Eligibility criterion : patient age &gt; 18 year acute STEMI treat PPCI within 12 hour symptom onset agree provide write informed consent . STEMI define chest pain associate ST-elevation 1 mm two contiguous lead new left bundle-branch block within 12 hour onset chest pain . Exclusion criterion : implant stent diameter &lt; 2.5 mm , cardiogenic shock , time pain onset PPCI &gt; 12 hour , previous thrombolytic therapy ( rescue PPCI ) , inability provide inform consent . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion may enrol study . Interventional procedure All patient enrol randomize study treat accord standard care centre accord guideline . Pharmacological treatment . At admission procedure patient treat 500 mg chewable aspirin , 600 mg clopidogrel 5000 U unfractionated heparin i.v . Additional intravenous heparin administer procedure maintain activate clotting time 200-250 second use glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor 250-300 second without administration glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor . The administration glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor ( preferably intracoronary abciximab ) leave operator 's discretion significantly encourage . At end procedure final angiography dose 1 µg nitrate i.c . administrate . After procedure case heparin administration interrupt patient treat low dose aspirin ( 100 mg/day ) clopidogrel ( 75 mg/day ) . Procedure . Direct stenting encouraged , use predilation leave operator 's discretion . The use manual thrombectomy stenting predilation mandatory case Thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) flow ≤1 high thrombus burden cross lesion wire . In case effort make use single stent whenever possible . All stent deploy 14 atmosphere 30 second case angiography perform . Post-dilatation expansion stent discourage allow case sub-optimal angiographic result . Stent . Two different stent design employ : close cell stent ( Presillion Plus™ , Cordis ) two open cell stent ( Driver™ Integrity™ , Medtronic ) . Randomization . Eligible patient randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive either close cell stent open stent cell . Allocation one two stent make mean sealed envelope contain conceal computer-generated random sequence set block 20 . In-hospital assessment clinical follow-up Laboratory test : patient undergo pre-procedural , 12 , 24 48 hour blood draw measure creatine kinase ( CK ) , CK-myocardial band ( CK-MB ) mass , troponin T routinely schedule patient centre . Electrocardiogram : A 12 lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record procedure evaluate ST resolution END-POINTS Primary end-point : primary end-point correct TIMI frame count end procedure define number frame require opacify standardized angiographic landmark normalize vessel length composite angiographic electrocardiographic end-point include angiographic event distal embolization , slow-flow ( decrease flow TIMI 3 TIMI 2 ) no-reflow ( decrease flow TIMI 2 3 TIMI 0 1 ) binary ECG criterion microvascular reperfusion injury define presence persistent ( &gt; 50 % initial value ) ST-segment elevation 30 60 min completion procedure previously describe . Secondary end-points : Secondary end-points : correct TIMI frame count stent deployment ; composite angiographic end-point include angiographic event distal embolization , slow-flow ( decrease flow TIMI 3 TIMI 2 ) no-reflow ( decrease flow TIMI 2 3 TIMI 0 1 ) stent deployment ; infarct size detect myocardial enzyme release . Tertiary end-points : hospital major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) ( death , reinfarction , target lesion revascularization )</detailed_description>
