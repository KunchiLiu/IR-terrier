	<brief_summary>Corneal collagen crosslinking ( CXL ) propose effective method reduce progression keratoconus corneal ectasia surgery , well possibly decrease steepness cornea pathology . During CXL procedure , central corneal thickness show significantly change . The investigator 's believe good maintenance corneal thickness potentially could benefit well reproducibility crosslinking effect improve predictability result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Corneal Collagen Crosslinking Progressive Keratoconus Ectasia Using Riboflavin/Dextran Hypotonic Riboflavin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study investigate difference two riboflavin preparation UV ( ultraviolet ) administration . Both riboflavin preparation currently general use worldwide U.S. clinical trial corneal collagen crosslinking . The first preparation contains riboflavin dextran solution , may tend dehydrate cornea keep thinner . The second preparation contains riboflavin solution without dextran ; case , relative hypotonicity may tend keep cornea well hydrate thicker . The primary goal study see use hypotonic riboflavin ( rather riboflavin dextran ) good maintains consistent corneal thickness CXL procedure . The second goal study determine good maintenance corneal thickness potentially could benefit well consistency procedure , decrease corneal haze formation , improve safety endothelial cell . Safety efficacy outcome compare group . In particular , compare corneal thickness measure ultrasonic pachymetry immediately CXL procedure randomize eye . Secondary outcome include visual acuity , long term corneal thickness change , corneal steepness change . Safety assessment include tabulation adverse event , patient symptom , loss visual acuity , change endothelial cell density , slit lamp examination cornea lens , contact lens tolerance contact lens wearer</detailed_description>
