	<brief_summary>Chronic renal failure ( CRF , `` chronic kidney failure '' , CKF , `` chronic kidney disease '' , CKD ) slowly progressive loss renal function period month year define abnormally low glomerular filtration rate , usually determine indirectly creatinine level blood serum . CRF lead severe illness require form renal replacement therapy ( dialysis ) call end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . While renal replacement therapy maintain patient indefinitely prolong life , quality life severely affect . Renal transplantation increase survival patient stage 5 CKD significantly compare therapeutic option ; however , associate increase short-term mortality ( due complication surgery ) . In view , definitely urgent need find different method treatment patient undergo establish modality treatment try unsuccessfully hence inadequacy current treatment modality insufficiency donor organ transplantation drive search improve method deal renal failure . The rise concept cell-based therapeutic provide framework around new approach generate , combination advance stem cell research stand bring field clinical fruition . Since CRF affect large number patient lose productive life , stem cell implantation offer promise improve health . In present study , want evaluate safety efficacy ( know / observe Proof concept five indian patient ) , autologous bone marrow derive stem cell inject Renal Artery five ( initially five patient , increase ten patient observe initial result ) patient Chronic Renal Failure .</brief_summary>
