	<brief_summary>Spirometry recommend component asthma diagnosis treatment primary care setting , yet primary care provider report routine use spirometry provision care asthma patient . Misclassification asthma severity report assessment base symptom alone . This misclassification lead inadequate treatment may result increased morbidity increase healthcare utilization/cost . However , even spirometry utilized aid asthma severity classification , primary care provider high rate fail meet quality goal test establish American Thoracic Society . The goal study evaluate effectiveness Spirometry Fundamentals™ tool training primary care provider staff produce high-quality flow-volume curve compare exist training modality gather information 'real-world ' setting use improve Spirometry Fundamentals™ .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Currently self-paced , distance learn program exist train staff perform good quality spirometry test . This study evaluate effectiveness distance-learning tool training primary care provider medical assistant use spirometry assist manage obstructive lung disease ( asthma COPD ) . This tool call `` Spirometry Fundamentals™ : A basic guide lung function test '' . It computer-based train program teach primary care provider staff spirometry , use , technique require perform high-quality spirometry , clinical interpretation spirometric data . We evaluate effectiveness Spirometry Fundamentals primary care set conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Study participant primary care physician ( MDs DOs ) staff ( medical assistant ( MAs ) nurse ( RNs ) ) recruit study pair . The role MDs utilize spirometry clinical care order spirometry test base clinical judgment , role MAs perform spirometry . The patient perform spirometry part usual care consider study subject .</detailed_description>
