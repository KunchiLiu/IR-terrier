	<brief_summary>Scientists discover number hormone control feeling hunger fullness . One particular hormone , call GLP-1 , associate feeling hunger fullness . The overall purpose study look closely GLP-1 change feeling observe hormone affect brain 's function . To , volunteer ask come clinic screen visit , 2 study visit . This outpatient study screen visit last hour two subsequent study visit 3 hour . During study , patient receive drug block effect hormone make gut . We take series blood sample measure hormone use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) take picture brain . Understanding action hormone brain may eventually lead new way help people avoid obesity lose weight .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role GLP-1 Satiety Perception Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many time day , see food representation food evaluate whether food look good u . If , balance external factor , social situation time day , internal signal hunger state order decide eat . However , recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study suggest internal signal , hormone regulate appetite satiety , govern food intake part act neural circuit affect whether give food appear appetizing moment . In addition , photograph food perceive `` fattening '' activate brain region involve appetite reward processing , include hypothalamus , nucleus accumbens , orbital frontal cortex . This activity potently reduce food intake , suggest reflect underlie brain mechanism involve satiety . We propose study mechanism change brain activity ask directly relate action glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , satiety signal . GLP-1 release cell gut response nutrient , suppress food intake , action block GLP-1 receptor antagonist , exendin- [ 9-39 ] . In 2 randomized , control , crossover study , ass whether exendin- [ 9-39 ] infusion reverse GLP-1-mediated effect food intake brain response visual food cue . Our scientific aim 1 ) observe effect exendin ( 9-39 ) block GLP-1-mediated satiety human assess effect food intake human first time ( knowledge ) 2 ) test whether endogenous GLP-1 signaling required effect meal reduce brain response visual food cue human . We hypothesize exendin- [ 9-39 ] diminish effect meal suppress subsequent food intake reduce activation visual food cue reward pathway . Determining extent experience satiety arise decrease reward value food fundamentally important understand human feed behavior . In addition , promise line research directly relevant press public health issue time : obesity overnutrition . We hope investigate mechanism affect perception satiety basic level eventually result novel behavioral pharmacologic strategy obesity prevention treatment .</detailed_description>
