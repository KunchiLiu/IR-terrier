	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Osteoporosis one common skeletal disorder . Today United States , 10 million individual osteoporosis 34 million low bone mass osteopenia , place increase risk day develop osteoporosis . Of people affected problem , 68 % woman . [ 1 ] Osteoporosis characterize low bone mass microarchitectural disruption , few , thin bony spicule present lead less structural support . These hallmark feature osteoporosis lead increase skeletal fragility increase fracture risk . [ 2 ] Hip fracture specifically show major problem lead increased morbidity mortality . [ 3 ] In addition osteoporotic fracture responsible large portion health care spending . In 1995 $ 13.8 billion health care expenditures attributable osteoporotic fracture . [ 4 ] Because health older adult often deteriorate hip fracture , effort prevent fracture treat prevent osteoporosis critical reducing common cause morbidity , mortality health service utilization . The current thinking development osteoporosis change bone turnover occur age play major factor . One study measure marker bone formation , osteocalcin ( OC ) , marker bone resorption , type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide ( NTX ) , show rate bone formation resorption high elderly woman . However , bone resorption increase bone formation lead resorption major determinant bone mass . [ 5 ] These biochemical marker bone formation resorption may play important role monitoring therapy . In recent review examine clinical study bone turnover marker measure begin treatment bisphosphonate , data show suppression bone turnover marker occur little three month therapy . [ 6,7 ] This suppression bone turnover marker also associate reduction risk fracture . [ 6,7 ] Although dual X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) gold standard diagnosis osteoporosis osteopenia , recent report show DXA may best method measure bone health . For example , bone fracture routinely occur despite modest bone mineral density level significant reduction risk fracture occur patient take one two standard medication , one significantly increase bone mineral density moderately increase . [ 6 ] Thus , currently think bone quality may clinically assessed measure determination bone metabolism biochemical marker bone turnover marker measure `` living '' bone cell . [ 6 ] Many modality treatment use prevent bone loss increase fracture risk associate osteoporosis osteopenia . One method involve use calcium vitamin D supplementation total calcium intake approximately 1500 mg/day . Calcium vitamin D supplementation may increase bone mineral density small extent , nearly degree see treatment modality . [ 8 ] Therefore , often combine another treatment method well efficacy . Bisphosphonates use often postmenopausal woman . These antiresorptive agent show prevent bone loss reduce incidence vertebral nonvertebral fracture . [ 9 ] Calcitonin show decrease vertebral fracture , increase bone mineral density lumbar spine inhibit bone turnover . [ 10 ] Melatonin supplementation may another treatment modality lower risk hip fracture perimenopausal woman . Melatonin remodel bone animal model culture . [ 11 ] Melatonin work melatonin receptor form osteoblast human mesenchymal stem cell [ 12 ] show inhibit osteoclast activity rodent . [ 13 ] Melatonin level correlate modulate bone marker whereby low nocturnal level melatonin correlate increase bone marker metabolism osteoporosis . [ 14 ] The addition exogenous melatonin suppress bone marker metabolism . [ 15 ] Work laboratory reveals application melatonin human bone stem cell grown culture enhances alkaline phosphatase activity 50 % calcium deposition 10-fold . [ 16 ] HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS We hypothesize melatonin improve bone health , menopausal quality life sleep compare placebo perimenopausal woman . 1 . Assess feasibility recruit perimenopausal woman willing enrolled randomize , trial melatonin versus placebo 2 . Assess effect melatonin versus placebo marker bone health , quality life , sleep disturbance . PRIMARY ENDPOINTS : The primary outcome variable bone turnover marker status , melatonin level measure blood bone density measure Achilles method . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS : 1 . Quality life measure MenQOL , validate scale menopausal quality life 2 . Sleep , measure Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire RESEARCH PLAN This study longitudinal , cohort trial 20 subject perimenopausal age 45 year old great new onset irregular menses due know cause polycystic ovary hypothyroidism . Perimenopause define time onset menstrual irregularity menopause ; lab test diagnostic perimenopause . Thus , investigator include woman , accord age , likely perimenopausal ( age 45 great ) symptom perimenopause ( irregular menses ) . Once cohort 20 subject recruit , investigator randomize volunteer use computer-generated blocked randomization scheme . Five study subject receive placebo 15 study subject receive melatonin , 3 mg ) . The woman enrol study ask take treatment mouth bedtime day 6 month coincide nocturnal surge melatonin day . This dose melatonin choose 3 mg melatonin commonly use induce phase-shifts circadian rhythm people . [ 17 ] Seeing one secondary endpoint , dose appropriate . Regarding melatonin 's effect bone , nothing know efficacy form bone woman . Therefore , dose melatonin chosen base report literature use pre-clinical vitro culture model show positive effect bone formation . These report show variable effect melatonin range 400 pM rat [ 15 ] , 5 mg melatonin mouse ( unpublished data ) 50 nM human mesenchymal stem cell grown culture . [ 12,16 ] The bioavailability melatonin 17 % female take 250 mcg melatonin po . [ 18 ] Thus , 3 mg dose melatonin take mouth would result nocturnal exogenous level 2.19 mM . The terminal half-life melatonin 41 minute female [ 18 ] , however , accumulation melatonin bone marrow occur [ 11 ] . Therefore , data suggest 3 mg dose appropriate study . PLANS FOR ASSESSMENT AND STUDY OUTCOMES Our primary outcome level bone turnover marker , OC NTX , bone density melatonin take baseline 6 month treatment . The change bone turnover marker level compare take melatonin take placebo . Baseline level OC NTX calculate . For study investigator also visually inspect data order perform descriptive analysis demographic characteristic population , age , weight . We explore characteristic individual significant improvement bone turnover marker , compliance treatment , diet , lifestyle determine diary . We also make note characteristic current past cigarette smoking alcohol caffeine consumption individual risk factor may show less improvement bone turnover marker . We use intention treat primary analysis . We attempt minimize miss data careful follow-up subject , maintain consistent contact study period , remunerate inconvenience . If subject drop study , investigator still attempt obtain follow study . Expected Outcomes.We expect perimenopausal woman take melatonin show improvement overall bone health reveal increase bone density , increase OC decrease NTX level compare woman take placebo . We also expect take melatonin well control menopausal symptom , good quality life le sleep disturbance compare placebo control . The potential benefit participate study include possibility decrease bone turnover reduce fracture risk well improve sleep regardless , condition much affect population woman . The data study may provide novel alternative us melatonin prevention osteoporosis provide woman option manage disease associate menopause .</detailed_description>
