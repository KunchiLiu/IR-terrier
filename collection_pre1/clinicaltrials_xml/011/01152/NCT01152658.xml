	<brief_title>Partial Tear Supraspinatus ( SSP ) Treatment With Plasma Rich Growth Factors ( PRGF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary endpoint : evaluate functional change treatment local infection platelet rich plasma . This functional change evaluate Constant Score ( questionnaire shoulder function ) clinical examination . Secondary endpoint : evaluate heal effect platelet rich plasma locally inject partial tear SSP tendon . These morphologic change evaluate echography Selection withdrawal subject 40 patient partial tear supraspinatus tendon diagnose echography .
