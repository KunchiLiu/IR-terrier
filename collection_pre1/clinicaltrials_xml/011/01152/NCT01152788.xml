	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect experimental drug , call interleukin 21 rIL-21 , malignant melanoma whether effect look promising compare dacarbazine . In addition , study look side effect rIL-21 , special blood test do check level rIL-21 blood . This study also look previously remove melanoma tissue determine patient might benefit treatment . This research do currently effective treatment type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically document cutaneous malignant melanoma recurrent metastatic curable surgical mean . Patients must tumour tissue primary and/or metastatic tumour available assess putative molecular marker response ( paraffin block 12 unstained slide ) . Presence clinically and/or radiologically documented disease . At least one site disease must unidimensionally measurable follow : Chest Xray &gt; 20 mm , CT scan ( slice thickness &lt; 5 mm ) &gt; 10 mm ( long diameter ) , Physical exam ( use caliper ) &gt; 10 mm , Lymph nod CT scan &gt; 15 mm measure short axis . All radiology study must perform within 21 day prior randomization ( Exception : Within 28 day negative ) . Patients must either maximum tumour lesion size ≤ 50 mm OR tumour lesion &gt; 50 mm , LDH must ≤ 2.5 x ULN . Patients must life expectancy least 12 week . Age &gt; 18 year . ECOG performance status 01 . Previous Therapy : Immunotherapy : Prior adjuvant immunotherapy melanoma permit complete ≥ 1 month prior study entry . No immunotherapy metastatic disease permit . rIL21 dacarbazine must first systemic therapy metastatic disease . Chemotherapy : Patients must receive prior chemotherapy ( include regional therapy ) . rIL21 dacarbazine must first systemic therapy metastatic disease ( except RAF MEKInhibitors ) . Surgery : Previous surgery permissible . Patient must &gt; 4 week since major surgery . Radiation Therapy : Previous radiation therapy permit exception radiation therapy brain metastasis . Patients must &gt; 4 week since last treatment radiation . Exceptions may make , however , low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy . Patients must recover toxic effect radiation . Laboratory Requirements : ( must do within 7 day prior randomization ) Hematology : Absolute granulocyte ( AGC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Chemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL , Bilirubin ≤ UNL AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x UNL , LDH ≤ 2.5 x UNL . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day enrollment . Sexually active patient must agree use medically accept form contraception receive study therapy . Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . It responsibility local participate investigator obtain necessary local clearance , indicate write NCIC CTG Study Coordinator clearance obtain , trial commence centre . Because differ requirement , standard consent form trial provide sample form give Appendix VII . A copy initial REB approval approve consent form must send central office . The patient must sign consent form prior randomization . Please note consent form study must contain statement give permission qualify representative NCIC CTG , BMS , ZymoGenetics , company collaborator , regulatory authority review patient record ( see section 16 detail ) statement give permission NCIC CTG access study tissue biomarker assessment . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients randomized trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization . Patients know HIV , Hepatitis B Hepatitis C infection . History malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , interventional cardiac procedure within past 12 month , autoimmune condition require chronic immunosuppressive therapy , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients may receive investigational agent within 28 day study entry , may receive concurrent treatment anticancer therapy investigational agent protocol therapy . Patients know brain metastasis history CNS metastases exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . A head CT MRI require patient rule brain metastasis . Pregnant lactating woman . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother rIL21 dacarbazine , breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol therapy . Prohibited Medications : Long Term ( &gt; 7 day ) Systemic Corticosteroids ( e.g . prednisone , dexamethasone , etc . ) may counteract stimulatory effect rIL21 lymphocyte . ( Note : Topical steroid allow ) .</criteria>
