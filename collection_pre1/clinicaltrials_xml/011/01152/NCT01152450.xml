	<brief_summary>Rationale current trial demonstrate 24 hour bronchodilator efficacy safety tiotropium 5 µg administer daily ( even ) regard beneficial compliance convenience patient comparison placebo . Further rationale evaluate efficacy safety tiotropium 2.5 µg administer twice daily deliver Respimat® inhaler comparison placebo tiotropium 5 µg administer daily ( even ) deliver Respimat® inhaler patient moderate persistent asthma . Rationale pharmacokinetic subinvestigation evaluate 24 hour exposure tiotropium patient moderate persistent asthma administer 5 µg tiotropium daily ( even ) 2.5 µg tiotropium twice daily .</brief_summary>
