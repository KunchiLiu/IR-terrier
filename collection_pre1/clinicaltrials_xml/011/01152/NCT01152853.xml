	<detailed_description>The role HER-2 carcinogenesis prognostic role breast cancer already well establish . Furthermore value HER-2 reasonable therapeutic target breast cancer translate good clinical therapeutic result use HER-2 target agent , trastuzumab lapatinib . In case gastric cancer , incidence HER-2 positivity ( 2+ , 3+ IHC and/or FISH ( + ) ) report similar breast cancer , 22 % case . A recent ToGA Trial , phase III trial compare trastuzumab combine chemotherapy ( fluoropyrimidine+cisplatin ) versus chemotherapy alone chemotherapy-naïve HER-2 ( + ) gastric cancer show significant benefit use trastuzumab term overall survival progression-free survival . It provide clinical evidence HER-2 reasonable potential therapeutic target gastric cancer . Nowadays , lapatinib , HER-1 HER-2 dual inhibitor , also test clinical trial gastric cancer . PF-00299804 orally available , potent , highly selective irreversible small molecule inhibitor Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( HER ) family tyrosine kinase : HER-1 ( EGFR ) , HER-2 HER-4 ( HER-3 posse kinase activity ) . PF-00299804 inhibits tyrosine kinase activity HER family bind ATP bind site , result covalent modification cystine ATP binding pocket . The unique irreversible highly selective property PF-00299804 HER kinase family result sustain suppression receptor tyrosine kinase activity . The long-lasting inhibition receptor phosphorylation reduces concern potentially short plasma half-lives . Furthermore , low nanomolar potency irreversible binding intend target reduce need high peak plasma level , turn could minimize target-nonspecific toxicity . In preclinical study , PF-00299804 highly active HER-2 amplify gastric cancer cell line . ( SNU preclinical data ) Overall , standard care advance gastric cancer modest benefit plateau response rate use various combination chemotherapy . Therefore , development treatment option advance gastric cancer patient , especially HER-2 ( + ) gastric cancer patient , remain target active research . So , investigator plan phase II trial PF-00299804 monotherapy patient HER-2 positive advance gastric cancer failure least one chemotherapy regimen .</detailed_description>
