	<detailed_description>Following thoracic surgery ( open thoracoscopic ) patient surgically induced pneumothorax hence tube thoracostomy need drain air effusion . Due , patient must undergo post operative chest x-ray ( CXR ) evaluation order evaluate chest make decision regard removal chest tubes well decision regard patient discharge . Following chest tube removal , surgeon advocate CXR evaluation assure pneumothorax introduce removal tube . Repetitive CXR evaluation costly , inconvenient , expose patient healthcare worker repetitive radiation , require time . Surgeon-performed US could perform adjunct physical examination . This would allow surgeon make decision regard chest tube removal round , alleviate need CXRs well decrease patient length stay . The goal project : evaluate reliability accuracy surgeon-performed US follow thoracic surgery , evaluate potential improve convenience patient healthcare system use surgeon-performed US . US technology traditionally domain radiologist ; however , recently US evolve important tool clinician , similar stethoscope past , utilized organ specialty specific manner . Users US clinical care daily basis specialty specific indication : cardiologist , gastroenterologist , anesthesiologist , OBGYN , trauma , breast , ENT , hepatobiliary , colorectal surgeon . US technology yet find place domain thoracic surgeon diagnosis treatment pulmonary malignancy , although many potential important application use . We believe portable hand-held ultrasound may thoracic surgeon 's stethoscope future . Thoracic ultrasound show accurate diagnose pneumothorax ( sensitivity , specificity = 90 % ) well study trauma population ( sensitivity 95 % ) , however , study do use thoracic ultrasound non-injured population . To knowledge , currently center use thoracic ultrasound routinely post-operative set follow general thoracic surgery . Buzzas et al . show surgeon surgical resident perform focus abdominal sonography initial evaluation trauma patient able correctly diagnose injury safely accurately radiologists . Sensitivity , specificity , accuracy negative predictive value significantly different surgeon radiologist group . This study consist prospective evaluation surgeon-performed US follow thoracic surgery . CXR diagnosis pneumothorax/pleural effusion take `` gold standard '' US detection pneumothorax/pleural effusion measure CXR . Standard post-operative evaluation management patient apply . Thoracic US evaluation chest occur time sequence CXR patient enrol study . The result US compare CXR finding . Proposed management decision base US compare actual management decision make surgeon base CXR find . The propose project clinical feasibility safety study concern new indication surgeon perform ultrasound general thoracic surgery . Surgeon perform ultrasound recently become popular initial evaluation injure patient well office-based visualization cyst mass . It also use aid biopsy mass attain central venous access critical care set . We plan evaluate surgeon perform ultrasound evaluation post-operative pneumothorax pleural effusion follow thoracic surgery . Surgeon perform ultrasound compare plain film CXR , consider `` gold standard '' . If result study show surgeon perform ultrasound accurate sensitive evaluation post-operative thoracic surgery patient , ultrasound could replace CXR post-operative care patient . Ultrasound evaluation pleural space surgeon post-operatively would lead decreased cost , length stay patient inconvenience . Surgeon-performed ultrasound could use adjunct physical examination ward round . This would make decision regard chest tube management possible morning round , would eliminate cost repeat CXRs . Following initial cost purchasing ultrasound machine , perform test daily basis would cost anything . Furthermore , patient ( chest tube ) would longer need transported radiology department order undergo proper evaluation pleural space . There tremendous advantage minimally invasive diagnostic treatment strategy one describe proposal healthcare system . By enable early , rapid , safe diagnostic treatment strategy patient , healthcare system benefit short hospital duration stay , wait time procedure cost . This extremely attractive important Canadian environment . This project lead enhance process care lung cancer patient . Hypotheses : Bedside transthoracic ultrasonography simple , quick , reproducible , cost-effective novel method accurately evaluate post-operative thoracic surgery patient . Objectives : - Describe surgeon resident ability learn apply thoracic ultrasound inpatient population . - Evaluate reliability surgeon-performed ultrasound follow general thoracic surgery . - Compare criterion-related validity , specifically sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value surgeon-performed ultrasound diagnose post-operative pneumothorax effusion use chest x-ray criterion `` gold standard '' . - Evaluate marginal cost minimization associate use surgeon perform ultrasound post thoracic surgery compare conventional chest x-ray . Study Design : Prospective , cohort study design . Clinical Trial : Intervention - pleural US . All patient receive post-operative pleural-based ultrasound follow-up care thoracic surgery ward . Methods : This study consist prospective non-randomized evaluation surgeon-performed ultrasound follow thoracic surgery . All patient undergo elective , open thoracoscopic thoracic surgery indication CHUM - Hopital Notre Dame , Montreal , Quebec , Canada approach attempt enrol study . Patients enrol consent study treat physician pre-operative evaluation pre-operative clinic . There approximately 12 potential patient per week . Chest x-ray ( CXR ) diagnosis pneumothorax take `` gold standard '' ultrasound detection pneumothorax measure CXR . The sensitivity ultrasound diagnose pneumothorax show 95 % . A clinical nurse specialist acquire require data interview patient well patient 's chart . He enter data prospective database specifically design study . The nurse also responsible assure surgeon complete study case report form correctly ultrasound evaluation . He also record result CXRs database . Standard post-operative evaluation management patient apply entire study . Chest x-rays order usual decision regard chest tube removal management make base solely CXR finding . Thoracic ultrasound evaluation chest occur time sequence CXR patient enrol study . A thoracic surgeon senior surgical resident train thoracic ultrasound perform ultrasound . The surgeon record outcome his/her evaluation chest dichotomous variable ( pneumothorax - YES/NO , pleural effusion - YES/NO ) specialize study case report form . The surgeon also record management decision study report form ( management he/she would undertake he/she act ultrasound find alone ) . The result ultrasound compare CXR finding ( reported staff radiologist ) . Proposed management decision base ultrasound compare actual management decision make surgeon base CXR find . The radiologist blind respect surgeon 's ultrasound assessment vice-versa . Learning Phase During first two week study , surgeon resident practice ultrasound technique 24 patient . The result finding compare CXR evaluate order ass learn curve technique . During phase study , discrepancy surgical staff 's finding CXR report staff day provide feedback enhance learn process . After surgical staff review CXR , re-evaluate patient use ultrasound machine order learn mistake . Management decision regard patient care base ultrasound record `` learning phase '' study . Assessment Phase Following learn phase , assessment study commence . During phase , patient enrol study undergo ultrasound evaluation pleural space every time CXR order post-operative period . The ultrasound patient conduce two different surgeon select randomly pseudo-randomly base availability . This phase study conduct order define reliability ultrasound diagnose pneumothorax/pleural effusion , well ability ultrasound use sole decision-making diagnostic test follow general thoracic surgery . Reliability specifically inter-rater reliability assess degree agreement ultra-sound result record two surgeon . The kappa statistic use assess degree agreement minimal kappa level 70 % . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , overall accuracy likelihood ratio compute surgeon-ultrasound CXR . Each surgeon 's observation consider independent record , thus remove complication disagreement surgeon possible confounding . The psychometric property list estimated crude value . However , subgroup analyse logistic regression evaluate impact surgeon/assessor , learn curve slope surgeon , difficulty case assess radiologist accuracy likelihood false negative false positive result . Marginal cost difference surgeon perform ultrasound CXR base overall risk-benefit assessment take account training requirement , accuracy cost facility well physician service . Cost assessment take account management potential false negative false positive result .</detailed_description>
