	<brief_title>Study RAD001 Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although histologic appearance adenoid cystic carcinoma low grade , management malignancy distinct therapeutic challenge insidious local growth pattern , propensity perineural involvement , tendency distant metastasis , pronounced ability recur prolonged period . In prospectively perform clinical trial , objective response cytotoxic agent regimen infrequent , whereas stabilization disease observe commonly . In adenoid cystic carcinoma , study focus PI3-K/AKT/mTOR pathway rare . According Younes MN et al 's study , adenoid cystic carcinoma cell line increase pAkt activity EGF-stimulation add . And treat EGFR/VEGFR TK dual inhibitor , phosphorylated form Akt decrease despite total level Akt remain unchanged . When investigator consider increase pAkt activity one possible predictor mTOR inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor might activity adenoid cystic carcinoma . Although mTOR clearly attractive therapeutic target tumor , clinical study mTOR inhibition RAD001 systematically conduct adenoid cystic carcinoma . In phase I study RAD001 , 2 patient adenoid cystic carcinoma show response RAD001 ( unpublished data ) . So investigators design phase II study RAD001 adenoid cystic carcinoma evaluate efficacy RAD001 orphan disease .</detailed_description>
