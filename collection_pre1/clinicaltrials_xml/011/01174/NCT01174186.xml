	<brief_summary>Studies intestinally asymptomatic patient spondyloarthritis show approximately 1/3 visible ulcer colon scopic examination 2/3 change detectable microscopy . Only patient improve arthritis symptom show improvement colonic change . In study colon terminal ileum examine . Inflammation small intestine examine . Newer study show immunological link Crohns disease spondyloarthritis ulcerative colitis . The investigator wish examine small intestine patient treatment , since expect find ulcers link spondyloarthritis Crohns disease heal treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients inflammatory axial spondyloarthritis accord assessment group ankylose spondylitis ( ASAS ) criterion ( 8 ) active disease assess physician recruited outpatient clinic rheumatology department , provide patient normal circumstance expect benefit TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment full fill criterion treatment . Screening view participate study carry accordance inclusion exclusion criterion . Oral write patient information study , patient 's signing informed consent form sign patient 's power attorney accordance study protocol also condition inclusion . The include physician ensure potential participant inform right least 1 hour 's reflection time right friend/family member present information interview . If patient meet basis participation study inform consent form power attorney sign . The screened patient cod identify use Civil Registration Number ( CPR ) several reason . The study open-label , remove need blind patient well investigator . Blood sample book electronically print label CPR number put test tube immediate analysis storage . This guarantee fail-safe method handle various analysis , since procedure similar routine procedure . We find safe system method , label CPR number follow patient thoroughly test . Source data keep Danish Biologics Online Registry ( DANBIO registry ) clinical measure , electronic patient file lab data paper file image data . Data validity completeness control external `` good clinical practice '' monitoring . Adalimumab supply sterile solution without preservative subcutaneous injection 1 ml prefilled syrinx contain adalimumab 40 mg/0.8 ml , self-injected patient every 2 week week 20 . After week 20 patient continue adalimumab treatment 40 mg every week may change injection pen contain drug dosage . The drug inject skin abdomen thigh .
