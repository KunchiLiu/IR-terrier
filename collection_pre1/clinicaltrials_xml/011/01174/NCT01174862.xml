	<brief_summary>In patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft ( CAGB ) surgery , aspirin commonly prescribe prevent graft thrombosis myocardial ischemia . However , still significant number graft occlude postoperative period . This partly attribute reduced aspirin responsiveness , also call `` aspirin resistance '' . At moment , standardize definition laboratory test available quantify `` aspirin resistance '' , strong platelet reactivity laboratory test necessarily associate increase thrombotic event . However , increase evidence reduce aspirin responsiveness platelet function analyzer associate adverse long-term outcome high incidence major adverse event patient stable coronary artery disease patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention . In patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery , predictive value laboratory find reduce aspirin responsiveness remain unclear . Therefore , aim study prospectively evaluate whether pre- and/or postoperative laboratory find reduce aspirin responsiveness define MultiplateTM platelet function analyzer associate high incidence adverse outcome 30 day 12 month patient undergo CABG surgery .</brief_summary>
