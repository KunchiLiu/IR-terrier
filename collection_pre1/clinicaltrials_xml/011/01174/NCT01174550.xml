	<brief_summary>A prospective multicenter image study evaluation chest pain . Objective determine whether initial non-invasive anatomic imaging strategy coronary CT angiography ( CTA ) improve clinical outcome subject symptom concern coronary artery disease relative initial functional testing strategy ( usual care ) . Study hypothesis : initial anatomic testing strategy provide information result superior long-term health outcome compare initial functional testing strategy .</brief_summary>

Qualifying patient present new worsen symptom suspicious clinically significant CAD require diagnostic test previously evaluate randomized initial strategy either anatomic functional testing . All subsequent decision regard additional testing , medication and/or procedure discretion responsible clinical care team Within functional testing arm , subject 's care team select specific test perform ( exercise electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , stress nuclear , stress echocardiogram ( echo ) ) consistent 'usual care ' practice setting . The subject 's care team provide 'Information sheet ' summarize current standard test interpretation preventive care , specific medical treatment mandate trial .</detailed_description>
