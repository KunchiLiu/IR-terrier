	<brief_summary>Liposuction popular aesthetic surgery Brasil worldwide . Evidence show adipose tissue metabolically active tissue lead suggestion liposuction could viable method improvement metabolic profile immediate loss adipose tissue . Studies effect liposuction metabolic profile conflict . A study report improvement insulin sensitivity , inflammatory marker lipid profile , others observe change report worsen metabolic profile . In addition , animal study show compensatory growth intact adipose tissue response lipectomy . Physical exercise improve insulin sensitivity , lipid profile , inflammatory balance , adipose tissue distribution increase preserve free fat mass . Therefore , liposuction physical exercise seem act similar tissue body . To investigator knowledge , study associate effect liposuction exercise human . However , one suggest exercise training associate liposuction could : [ 1 ] attenuate block possible fat recovery compensatory growth ; [ 2 ] block reverse possible harmful effect liposuction ; [ 3 ] exert additive synergistic effect possible beneficial effect induce liposuction metabolic hormonal profile inflammatory balance .</brief_summary>
