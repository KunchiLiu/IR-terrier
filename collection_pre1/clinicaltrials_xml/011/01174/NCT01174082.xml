	<detailed_description>A vaccine make tumor protein take plasma ( liquid part blood ) KLH ( protein design increase immune response vaccine ) . By vaccinate brother sister protein make tumor , researcher hope increase antitumor effect stem cell . KLH use help immune response . Study Treatment Schedule : If find eligible take part study , brother sister receive vaccine KLH . This research involve various step . In Step 1 , large sample plasma collect vein use blood separator device . This plasma send MD Anderson GMP lab prepare vaccine . It take 3 month create myeloma-specific vaccine . It take 3 month prepare enough vaccine next phase study . In Step 2 , brother sister receive vaccine KLH injection skin 8 week , 6 week , 2 week collection his/her lymphocyte ( immune fight cell ) . After injection , brother sister receive injection medication call GM-CSF help body 's response vaccine . GM-CSF give skin near site vaccination every day 4 day , start day vaccination . In Step 3 , brother sister apheresis . During apheresis , blood pass `` cell separator '' lymphocyte ( immune fight cell ) collect . A portion cell give day . You get cell vein remainder store frozen research and/or use later fail respond first infusion . In Step 4 , receive vaccine KLH . It give skin immediately get infusion donor cell , 4 8 week lymphocyte infusion . After vaccine , receive injection medication call sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) help body 's response vaccine . GM-CSF give skin near site vaccination every day 4 day , start day vaccination . If 6 month respond vaccine , allow receive 3 additional vaccine , long develop graft versus host disease serious side effect first vaccine . The vaccine follow-up schedule exactly like first . Study Visits : Within 10 day receive infusion donor 's cell within 72 hour vaccine injection , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You check possible reaction treatment , include graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . Infused donor cell may react body . - You ask side effect may since first vaccine injection . - Blood ( 6-12 teaspoon ) draw routine test check kidney liver function , well status immune system . Part blood use test CMV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV , HTLV , syphilis , West Nile virus , sickle cell anemia , Chagas disease . Part blood collection also use pregnancy test females able child . To continue receive infusion donor 's cell , pregnancy test must negative . - You x-ray bone marrow aspirate biopsy ass response disease . These visit require 1 day time . Long-Term Follow-Up : Once month Months 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month last vaccine , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You check possible reaction treatment , include GVHD . - Blood ( 6-12 teaspoon ) draw check kidney liver , function well status immune system . Part blood collection also use pregnancy test females able child . To continue receive infusion donor 's cell , pregnancy test must negative . - You bone marrow biopsy aspiration . It may repeat often , doctor think need . If able return MD Anderson , study doctor may agree allow test procedures local doctor 's office . Your local doctor need send result research staff MD Anderson . Once year , start 2 year receive last infusion donor 's cell , contact phone check health status . Length Study Participation : You consider study 5 year . You take study time lymphocytes collect , enough lymphocyte collect , doctor think need , recipient able receive vaccine , study doctor think best interest , need treatment allow study , unable keep appointment , intolerable side effect . This investigational study . The myeloma-specific vaccine FDA approve commercially available , authorize use research . Up 10 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
