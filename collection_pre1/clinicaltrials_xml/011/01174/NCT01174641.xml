	<brief_summary>Problems attention affect around 40 % stroke survivor associate poor recovery function . This project provide large scale detailed examination date whether problem attention stroke remediated direct brain stimulation . In Part 1 project investigator use two form direct brain stimulation ( neural inhibition ) try balance activity across two side brain follow stroke one side . The investigator assess whether form stimulation lead improvement attentional function , well wide improvement cognitive ability activity everyday living . Performance test immediately post remediation longer-term follow-up , performance two intervention group assess data investigator collect large-scale screen cognitive impairment recovery function standard treatment condition . In Part 2 project investigator take promise intervention Part 1 investigator use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) determine brain change link recovery attentional function . The investigator test whether recovery link change balance activation within two hemisphere brain , whether associate structural change cortical tissue fibre tract . The project evaluate whether neural inhibition improve attentional function particular , cognitive ability everyday activity generally , stroke survivor . It also provide novel information recovery function come within brain .</brief_summary>
