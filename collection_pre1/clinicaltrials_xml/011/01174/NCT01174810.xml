	<brief_summary>Exenatide license , safe effective treatment patient Diabetes mellitus . Laboratory work show strong , reproducible evidence drug beneficial `` disease modifying '' effect give animal range experimental model Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . This project aim make initial evaluation possible benefit Exenatide among patient moderate symptom PD . The drug give twice daily 10microgram injection skin similar way one conventional `` symptomatic '' treatment PD ( Apomorphine ) . Forty patient moderate symptom PD recruit randomised receive Exenatide injection twice daily , act control open label trial . Detailed assessment make patient baseline periodically total 14 month . The primary outcome measure change baseline follow , severity validate PD assessment scale ( UPDRS part 3 motor score ) overnight period free conventional PD medication . Secondary measure include adverse event report , self complete questionnaire , blood test result . Aside assessment , patient continue regular PD medication throughout trial adjustment make accord clinical need . In subgroup patient ( n=10 ) , brain scan assess severity PD , perform baseline follow help understand possible mechanisms action Exenatide .</brief_summary>

Male patient female partner child bear potential must use adequate contraception ( condom +/spermicidal gel/foam ) throughout duration trial period . Age 4570 year Disease onset age 40 year Disease duration &gt; 5 year On Ldopa treatment . Patient must oral Ldopa treatment without dopamine agonist include Apomorphine , MAOB inhibitor , COMT inhibitor , Amantadine , Beta blocker , anticholinergic treatment History wear phenomena duration action single dose Ldopa &lt; 6 hour Stable PD medication precede 3 month i.e . change medication type dose . UPDRS motor medication score &gt; 15 Ldopa responsiveness . Defined &gt; 33 % improvement UPDRS motor medication score follow Ldopa challenge Able give inform consent Able comply trial protocol willing attend necessary clinic visit medication . Diagnosis suspicion cause parkinsonism include Vascular parkinsonism , post traumatic parkinsonism , drug toxin induce parkinsonism , neurodegenerative condition include Multiple System Atrophy , Progressive Supranuclear Palsy , Huntington 's disease , Wilson 's disease , Pantothenate kinase Neurodegeneration ( PKAN ) , Alzheimer 's disease , Creutzfeld Jacob disease . Known abnormality CT MRI brain imaging consider cause symptom sign neurological dysfunction , consider likely compromise compliance trial protocol . Concurrent dementia define score low 120 Mattis Dementia Rating Scale . Concurrent severe depression define score great 16 MADRS Exposure neuroleptic drug within 6 month prior baseline assessment Prior intracerebral surgical intervention Parkinson 's disease include Deep Brain stimulation , lesional surgery , growth factor administration , gene therapy cell transplant Already actively participate trial device , drug surgical treatment Parkinson 's disease , trial participation within previous 30 day .
