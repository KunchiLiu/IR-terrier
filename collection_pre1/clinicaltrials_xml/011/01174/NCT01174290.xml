	<brief_summary>About one-third patient develop mild , acute confusion ( i.e. , subsyndromal delirium ) go develop severe acute confusional state ( i.e . delirium ) . Delirium refers temporary change way person think thing . Delirium occur patient admitted hospital particularly patient sick , give number medication , able sleep normally . It affect behavior , understanding people thing around , ability make decision . While ICU doctor everything possible eliminate factor may cause delirium , delirium may cause person become agitated control dangerous safety well safety around . As well , delirium develop patient ICU , may increase risk death , keep patient ICU hospital longer send patient long term care facility rather home discharge hospital . A recent medical report find patient ICU develop subsyndromal delirium mortality rate , length stay ICU hospital , transfer rate long term care facility nearly great patient delirium great patient develop neither subsyndromal delirium delirium . Recent study non-ICU patient suggest patient high risk develop delirium receives medication call antipsychotic ( e.g . haloperidol ) may likely develop delirium develop delirium last long . No study evaluate effect administer antipsychotic patient ICU subsyndromal delirium . Another study complete ICUs Tufts Medical Center find may association development delirium patient subsyndromal delirium use haloperidol . However , small study many limitation thus currently know whether use haloperidol patient subsyndromal delirium actually cause few patient develop delirium . Haloperidol make person sleepy help control behavior like agitation . Haloperidol drug use often help control delirium ICU . This prospective , double-blind , randomize control study determine haloperidol administer vein four time daily ( 1mg IV q6h ) patient subsyndromal delirium , breathe machine care Medical ICU service Tufts Medical Center , help prevent patient develop delirium . A total 68 participant enrol . Exclusion criterion extensive include condition could affect ability determine delirium present increase risk side effect relate administration haloperidol . Patients older 80 exclude study . Study medication ( i.e . haloperidol ) administer one follow occurs : 1 ) delirium develop ( confirmed staff psychiatrist designate , 2 ) patient discharge ICU Tufts Medical Center , 3 ) patient receive haloperidol placebo 10 day 4 ) adverse event potentially attributable study drug experience patient deem , opinion pulmonologist member investigative team warrant discontinuation therapy . Haloperidol may cause unwanted side effect low blood pressure , twitch , unsafe abnormal heart rhythm . Patients chronic confusion ( e.g. , dementia Alzheimer 's Disease ) receive haloperidol include study . Patients carefully monitor side effect potentially related haloperidol . Patients become confusion-free ICU leave ICU ( i.e. , subsyndromal delirium ) ask provide consent research activity occur ICU . If patient cognition regain ( ie . subsyndromal delirium delirium ) willing provide consent study data collect ICU destroy approached participate post-ICU component study . This study also seek understand use haloperidol ICU patient subsyndromal delirium may affect memory , emotional status , happiness , ability function , quality sleep patient leave ICU . Patients ( delirium base CAM screening time 3-10 day 6 month assessment attempt ) approach participate post-ICU component study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing ICU Subsyndromal Delirium Conversion Delirium With Haloperidol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium occur 50 % patient mechanically ventilate 80 % intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient mechanically ventilate . Even control preexist morbidity , severity illness , coma use sedative , patient develop delirium ICU 3-times likely dead 6 month compare patient develop delirium . ( 1-4 ) Additionally , ICU delirium predictive threefold-higher reintubation rate &gt; 10 additional day hospital . ( 5 ) Each additional day mechanical ventilation place patient increase risk life-threatening sequela ventilator-associated pneumonia barotrauma . The sequelae delirium cumulative ; example , additional day spend delirium associate 20 % increase risk prolong hospitalization 10 % increase risk death . Given negative outcome , surprising delirium independently associate substantially high ICU total hospital cost patient develop delirium . ( 6 ) Up quarter patient develop delirium ICU develop long-term cognitive impairment frequently manifest dementia . ( 7-10 ) This post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment affect memory , attention , executive function . It therefore compromise ability return work , impairs activity daily live , increase need institutionalization , decrease quality life . ( 11-13 ) More 5,000,000 patient admitted ICU United States year . Delirium may develop 80 % patient . ( 1 , 2 , 14 ) It therefore critical intervention prevent delirium occur ICU discover . Given negative sequela delirium , current practice guideline recommend routine delirium screen ICU validate screen tool confusion assessment method ICU ( CAM-ICU ) Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) . ( 15-17 ) The ICDSC ( Appendix 1 ) 8-item checklist produce score 0 8 , item ( correspond value 1 8 ) reflect DSM-IV ( alternative ) diagnostic characteristic delirium many advantage CAM-ICU . ( 15 , 16 , 18 ) The data collect real-time nursing shift . An ICDSC score ≥ 4 show highly correlate formal psychiatric diagnosis delirium use DSM-IV criterion ( sensitivity 99 % , ROC curve area = 0.901 ) , excellent inter-observer reliability nurse nurse critical care physician . Recent investigation , within outside ICU , move beyond simply assign patient dichotomous outcome either delirious , instead focus grade severity delirium . ( 19 , 20 ) Patients characteristic delirium , full clinical delirium , deem subsyndromal delirium . [ 10 ] The ICDSC , give 8 different domain show good item reliability towards diagnosis delirium , allow one identify ICU patient fall short threshold diagnostic criterion overt 'clinical delirium ' still may clinically important sub-syndromal delirium ( ie . ICDSC 1-3 ) . ( 19 ) One recent ICU study compare outcome patient develop sub-syndromal delirium ( ICDSC 1 3 ) course ICU stay develop delirium ( ICDSC ≥ 4 ) develop neither delirium subsyndromal delirium ( ICDSC = 0 ) . In study 537 consecutive , non-comatose patient , 31.5 % develop neither clinical delirium subsyndromal delirium , 33.3 % develop subsyndromal delirium ( clinical delirium ) 35.3 % develop clinical delirium . Patients develop subsyndromal delirium ICU mortality rate 4x great patient develop neither clinical delirium subsyndromal delirium ( 10.6 % vs 2.4 % , p=0.002 ) . In addition , patient develop subsyndromal delirium , compare patient without clinical subsyndromal delirium , significantly longer ICU hospital length stay likely discharge long-term care facility home . When correction potential causative factor delirium fails reverse delirium , clinicians frequently turn antipsychotic therapy . ( 21 ) Haloperidol remain first-line pharmacologic therapy treatment delirium critical care clinician advocate use population practice guideline . ( 14 , 22 ) One large retrospective cohort analysis , potential confounding variable address , find use haloperidol within 2 day mechanical ventilation reduce death . ( 23 ) Two recent study demonstrate benefit antipsychotic therapy non-ICU patient high risk develop delirium . ( 23 , 24 ) In one randomized study elderly patient undergo hip surgery , population high risk develop delirium , administration oral haloperidol 0.5mg q8h decrease average Delirium Rating Scale ( DRS ) Score ( 14.4 ± 3.4 v 18.4 ± 4.3 , p &lt; 0.001 ) , duration delirium ( 5.4 vs 11.8 day , p &lt; 0.001 ) mean number day hospital ( 17.1± 11.1 v 22.6 ± 16.7 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . No haloperidol-related side effect note . ( 23 ) A recent placebo-controlled study demonstrate post-operative administration single dose risperidone patient undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery decrease incidence delirium 31.7 % 11.1 % ( p= 0.009 ) . ( 24 ) It note neither study enrol ICU patient incidence subsyndromal delirium baseline measure . The safety efficacy treat ICU patient delirium symptom antipsychotic therapy evaluate . Recent data highlight deleterious sequela subsyndromal delirium ICU . In addition , result two study demonstrate benefit administer low-dose antipsychotic therapy patient high risk delirium . We therefore hypothesize treatment subsyndromal delirium critically ill haloperidol prevent progression clinical delirium . This associate decreased agitation , short duration mechanical ventilation , improve cognitive function ICU discharge . Given document safety low-dose haloperidol therapy clinical practice , anticipate potential risk-benefit ratio intervention low - particularly ICU environment patient receive continuous cardio- respiratory monitoring . Critically ill patient subsyndromal delirium ( ICDSC 1-3 ) also risk substantial morbidity mortality high risk develop delirium ( ICDSC ≥ 4 ) . Recent study suggest administration low-dose antipsychotic therapy non-ICU patient risk delirium prevents transition delirium , reduce delirium severity shorten length hospital stay without cause adverse effect . Given 1.5 million Americans may develop subsyndromal delirium year , intervention find safe effective , particularly low cost , profound impact U.S. healthcare system . A subsyndromal risk factor study evaluate ICSDC nursing assessment data 100 consecutive mechanically ventilated patient admit ICU Tufts MC ≥ 24 hour without neurologic reason admission ( e.g. , acute stroke ) acute alcohol withdrawal . Of 100 patient , 72 develop subsyndromal delirium ( ICDSC 1 3 ) . Of 72 patient , 26 ( 36 % ) go develop delirium ( ICDSC ≥ 4 ) ICU admission . The remain 28 patient develop neither subsyndromal delirium delirium course ICU stay . For 26 patient developed delirium , find 2 patient receive ≥ 1 dose haloperidol therapy period prior delirium first identify . In contrast , 46 patient subsyndromal delirium progress delirium , 14 patient receive ≥ 1 dose haloperidol ICU stay . Therefore , weak association lower incidence delirium patient subsyndromal delirium receive ≥ 1 dose haloperidol time ICU admission patient receive haloperidol [ 2/16 ( 12.5 % ) v 24/56 ( 43 % ) , p &lt; 0.0001 ] . This retrospective , observational data suggest patient subsyndromal delirium expose haloperidol may remain subsyndromal delirium progress delirium . However , many methodological limitation pilot study thus remain unknown administer low-dose haloperidol ICU patient subsyndromal delirium prevent development delirium . Over past 3 year , delirium research group , joint collaboration Northeastern University Tufts Medical Center conduct number study surround identification treatment delirium ICU environment . ( 18 , 26-29 ) A three-hospital evaluation lead group find educational intervention consist patient case use script concordance theory didactic presentation improve ability bedside nurse use ICDSC correctly recognize delirium compare judge . ( 26 ) Another study group conduct found physician use ICDSC improve ability recognize delirium compare validate judge . ( 27 ) A large regional survey focus critical care nurse preference practice regard delirium assessment compare delirium assessment practice sedation assessment . ( 28 ) Finally , group conclude 36 patient double-blind randomize control trial evaluate use quetiapine delirium treatment ICU recently publish Critical Care Med . ( 29 ) The track record research group important give many challenge implement ICU delirium-focused investigation one propose . We therefore feel qualified conduct study propose evaluate safety efficacy haloperidol therapy critically ill patient subsyndromal delirium . This prior data experience conduct delirium research demonstrate : 1 . That progression delirium may lower patient subsyndromal delirium receive haloperidol . 2 . Our ability conduct high quality research field ICU delirium . 3 . A multidisciplinary ICU delirium research group include psychiatrist . 4 . An academic environment delirium assessment ICDSC become standard care . Delirium occur 80 % mechanically ventilated patient admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) . ( 1-4 ) Patients develop delirium likely die , stay ICU long cost healthcare system . ( 1-6 ) Moreover , delirium may cause cognitive dysfunction persist long recovery impact long-term functional ability quality life . ( 7-10 ) Given 5 million patient admitted year ICU United States , delirium critically ill major health care issue . Patients meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM ) IV criterion delirium deem subsyndromal delirium . ( 19 ) Patients develop subsyndromal delirium also likely die ICU require high level care ICU discharge . ( 19 ) Current practice guideline recommend routine delirium screen ICU use validated tool Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) . ( 14 , 22 ) Delirium often persist despite reversal causative factor thereby necessitate use pharmacologic therapy . Haloperidol remain pharmacologic treatment choice delirium ICU use associate low ICU mortality . ( 23 ) However , potential role prevent conversion subsyndromal delirium delirium unknown . In study plan determine whether treatment subsyndromal delirium critically ill haloperidol prevents progression delirium without cause adverse effect . Accomplishing aims determine pharmacologic intervention , haloperidol , routinely use critical care practice prevent patient subsyndromal delirium develop clinical delirium . If haloperidol find safe effective propose study , large study need determine effect haloperidol therapy patient mortality evaluate predictor drug response . Information propose study greatly need determine safe effective pharmacological intervention estimate 1.5 million Americans year develop subsyndromal delirium ICU . Survivors critical illness develop delirium may experience prolonged cognitive impairment decline , decrease functionality may suffer significant anxiety depression . Sleep disturbance common factor patient delirium know contribute impaired function . Hence , strategy aim reduce incidence delirium ICU may improve short long-term outcome . Neurocognitive deficit persist 75 % ICU patient 6-12 month ICU discharge presumably may higher ICU patient develop delirium ( 30 ) . Cognitive deficit global ( 31-33 ) , include deficit process speed , memory , attention . ( 31 ) Hopkins conclude consistent deficit across study decrease memory . ( 30 ) This pattern deficits , well consistent finding impair social occupational functioning ICU survivor ( 32 , 34 ) suggest impaired executive function . Executive function refers capacity plan , initiate , organize , inhibit , monitor think behavior . It pattern impairment think represent diffuse frontal lobe damage . Executive function typically poorly assess medically ill patient yet potentially substantial impact overall functioning . Functional incapacity include everyday issue difficulty buy grocery , keep appointment adhere medication regimen . ( 34 , 35 ) For geriatric patient treat ICU , 3 % normal post-ICU functional capacity . ( 36 ) It remain unclear change anxiety depressive symptom among patient develop delirium . Delirium worsen functional ability suspect also worsen emotional well , although well establish whether case . Given deleterious effect delirium may functional status , therefore important measure physical status , social functioning , mental health general health perception patient expose intervention may decrease incidence delirium . Sleep disturbance risk factor neurocognitive impairment prominent component delirium . ( 37 ) Thus disturbed sleep understood potential cause consequence ICU-related psychological cognitive morbidity . Since psychological morbidity often persist ICU discharge , likely disturbed sleep frequent post-ICU hospitalization . An intervention focus reduce delirium incidence affect post-ICU sleep quality .</detailed_description>
