The longterm objective project use new technology sensitively measure , automatically analyze efficiently manage clinical trial data Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) neurological disorder . This project focus develop objective measure balance gait mobility disability fall critical quality life PD . Clinical movement disorder expert team local start-up business develop , produce , test novel clinical balance gait assessment tool , instrument Timed Up Go Test ( iTUG ) patient Parkinson 's disease . Balance gait measure wireless sensor wear wrist , ankle trunk patient stand chair , walk , turn return sit chair . Accelerations angular velocity sensor automatically transmit , store , analyze , displayed Mobility Scores remote , centralized computer , along patient information important clinical trial . Specifically , proposal 1 ) create commercially-available , clinical trial system include completely wireless sensor technology , custom-made , user-friendly , computer interface efficient data management server ; 2 ) develop mobility score many potential balance gait measure 3 ) compare sensitivity iTUG compare traditional clinical test balance change PD due antiparkinson medication . By provide sensitive , accurate , comprehensive method quickly test analyze balance gait , clinical trial improve mobility patient Parkinson 's disease neurological disorder significantly effective efficient . This permit clinical trial Parkinson 's disease complete few subject , short duration , less cost.The current project accelerate development new therapy Parkinson 's disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : Aim I . To create novel , commercially-available system mobility assessment clinical trial Parkinson 's disease . We already develop laboratory prototype system iTUG test , computer interface , sensor , data management system cumbersome use clinical trial . In proposal , create robust , user-friendly clinical system iTUG test use wireless inertial sensor new user interface develop Portland start-up company , Automated Parkinson 's Disease Monitoring ( APDM ) , head co-investigator . This mobility measure system integrate new centralize data management server also develop APDM , Inc. support automatic data analysis data organization multi-site clinical trial . The feasibility new , clinical system vet use busy Movement Disorders Clinic . Aim II . To develop objective , composite iTUG mobility score . We recently demonstrate iTUG metric sensitive distinguish mobility performance people diagnose PD age-matched control traditional clinical test . In proposal , develop composite mobility score iTUG gait postural parameter responsive severity PD change levodopa ON OFF state . The composite score calculate use statistical model optimize difference performance 75 subject PD ON OFF levodopa state . Aim III . To prospectively determine reliability , validity responsiveness iTUG mobility score . We perform prospective study 60 patient PD compare standard clinical measure postural instability gait difficulty mobility ( PIGD item Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) TUG stop-watch score ) new iTUG mobility score OFF ON levodopa state . We hypothesize iTUG good test-retest reliability , significantly correlate standard clinical measure fall history responsive dopaminergic state current mobility test use clinical trial . This project develop , produce , test novel clinical balance gait assessment tool , instrument Timed Up Go test ( iTUG ) use new , wearable , inertial sensor new clinical trial data management server automatically transmits , store , analyzes data collect iTUG . By automatically provide sensitive , accurate , comprehensive method test balance gait , clinical trial improve mobility patient Parkinson 's disease neurological disorder significantly effective efficient .</detailed_description>
