	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 200 patient melanoma . Researchers want know TIL shrink tumor people digestive tract , urothelial , breast , ovarian/endometrial cancer . In study , select specific subset white blood cell tumor think effective fighting tumor use cell make tumor fight cell . Objective : The purpose study see specifically select tumor fight cell cause digestive tract , urothelial , breast , ovarian/endometrial tumor shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 metastatic digestive tract , urothelial , breast , ovarian/endometrial cancer tumor safely remove . Design : Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need . Surgery : If patient meet requirement study undergo surgery remove tumor use grow TIL product . Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis obtain additional white blood cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , TIL cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Metastatic digestive tract cancer , particular esophageal , gastric , pancreatic hepatobiliary carcinoma , associate poor survival beyond five year poor response exist therapy . - Data Surgery Branch literature support metastatic cancer potentially immunogenic TIL grown expand tumor . - In metastatic melanoma , TIL mediate regression bulky disease site administer autologous patient high dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow nonmyeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - The recent young-TIL approach , TIL minimally culture vitro , select tumor recognition , rapid expansion infusion metastatic melanoma patient , lead objective response rate comparable previous trial rely TIL screen tumor recognition , add toxicity . - In pre-clinical model , administration anti-PD-1 antibody enhance anti-tumor activity transfer T-cells . - We propose investigate feasibility , safety , efficacy TIL adoptive transfer therapy combination pembrolizumab metastatic cancer . Objectives : -With Amendment Q , determine ability autologous TIL infuse minimal vitro culture conjunction high dose aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen anti-PD-1 mediate tumor regression patient metastatic cancer . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must : - Metastatic digestive tract , urothelial , breast , ovarian/endometrial cancer refractory standard chemotherapy , originate ) gastric gastroesophageal junction , b ) pancreas , liver biliary tree , c ) colon rectum , ) bladder , e ) breast , f ) ovarian/endometrial ; - Normal basic laboratory value . Patients may : - Concurrent major medical illness ; - Severe hepatic function impairment due liver metastatic burden ; - Unpalliated biliary bowel occlusion , cholangitis , digestive tract bleeding ; - Any form immunodeficiency ; - Severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; - Contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - Patients undergo resection biopsy obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture autologous cancer cell line , frozen tissue archive . Lymph node , ascites , peritoneal implant , normal tissue adjacent metastatic deposit also obtain possible ongoing future research describe 03-C-0277 . - All patient cohort 3 receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine , pembrolizumab . On day 0 patient receive infusion autologous TIL begin high-dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 12 dos ) . - Pembrolizumab administer prior TIL admiistration continue 3 additional cycle . - Clinical immunologic response evaluate first follow-up evaluation follow last dose pembrolizumab . - Twenty-one patient initially enrol group ass toxicity tumor response . If two first 21 patient per group show clinical response ( PR CR ) , accrual continue 41 patient , target 20 % goal objective response . - Up 290 patient may enrol 3-8 year</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Measurable metastatic ( stage IV ) gastric , gastroesophageal , pancreatic , hepatocellular carcinoma , cholangiocarcinoma , gallbladder , colorectal , urothelial , breast , ovarian/endometrial carcinoma least one lesion resectable TIL generation minimal morbidity preferentially use minimal invasive laparoscopic thoracoscopic surgery removal superficial tumor deposit , plus one lesion measure . 2 . All patient must refractory approved standard systemic therapy . Specifically : Metastatic colorectal patient must receive oxaliplatin irinotecan . Hepatocellular carcinoma patient must receive sorafenib ( Nexavar ) , since level 1 data support survival benefit agent . Breast Ovarian cancer patient must refractory 1st line 2nd line treatment must receive least one second line chemotherapy regimen . 3 . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . 4 .
