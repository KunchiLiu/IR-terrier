	<brief_title>Acute Effects Coffee Appetite Inflammation Markers , Glucose Metabolism Energy Intake</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coffee pharmacologically active , widely consume beverage . Scientific interest relation coffee consumption revisit last decade light new , mainly epidemiological , evidence indicate potential health benefit . In specific , cross-sectional prospective study indicate coffee consumption associate low risk type 2 diabetes . Furthermore , inverse association find coffee consumption marker inflammation endothelial dysfunction healthy and/or diabetic participant , although opposite effect also report , mainly relation inflammation marker . In relation body weight , epidemiological data suggest increment caffeine consumption associate low mean weight gain energy intake 12-y period . However , information clinical study scarce . Acute caffeine and/or coffee consumption associate impaired glucose metabolism insulin resistance . In relation inflammation , animal study indicate beneficial effect coffee consumption , whereas clinical study human find increase adiponectin decrease interleukin-18 ( IL-18 ) blood concentration monthly intervention include daily consumption 8 cup coffee . As far energy balance concern , early experiment demonstrate ingestion 300 mg caffeine prior food intake , compare non-caffeine intake , significantly reduce energy intake 21.7 % men , woman . A recent study find combination caffeine red pepper positively associate energy expenditure negatively energy intake , whereas , also report positive association habitual caffeine intake body weight loss achieve very-low-calorie diet . Taking consideration limit clinical evidence regard acute effect coffee consumption appetite-related marker , subsequent energy intake inflammatory marker , undertook clinical study crossover design investigate short-term change energy intake , subjective appetite rating , appetite hormone , inflammation marker glucose metabolism caffeinated decaffeinated coffee consumption .</detailed_description>
