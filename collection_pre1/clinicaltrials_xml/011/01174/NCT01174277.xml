	<brief_title>Pilot Study : Patients With Chronic Active Graft Versus Host Disease That Have Failed Not Tolerated Standard Therapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The occurrence acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) prevention/treatment induce immunologic compromise . Graft-versus-host disease ( GvHD ) account significant morbidity mortality recipient allogeneic bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplant . The condition occur donor lymphocyte recognize recipient 's tissue foreign mount inflammatory destructive response recipient . GvHD predilection epithelial tissue , especially skin , liver , mucosa gastrointestinal tract . This lead severe skin lesion , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , liver failure . In addition , people GvHD especially susceptible infection . Approximately 30-70 % people undergoing allogeneic HSCT hematologic malignancy anticipate experience acute and/or chronic GVHD . The physical consequence depend severity GVHD , moderate severe organ system involvement associate substantial medical morbidity mortality . The current standard care treatment patient chronic graft-vs-host disease steroid treatment without calcineurin inhibitor . This treatment , effective , control chronic gvhd . The use extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) develop patient several inflammatory autoimmune disease , include scleroderma rheumatoid arthritis . Successful use ECP also report patient cutaneous T cell lymphoma , Sezary syndrome variant , cardiac lung transplant rejection T cell mediated/autoimmune autoimmune disease even facial transplantation . More recently , ECP proven highly effective useful tool treatment GvHD . The exact mechanism action ECP unknown , principle process induce leucocyte apoptosis UVA radiation exposure psoralens , light sensitizer . These leukocyte immediately re-infused patient , undergo early apoptosis . Following apoptosis , leukocytes engulfed macrophage antigen-presenting cell , immature dendritic cell , anti-inflammatory cytokine environment . The anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion pattern , switch TH1 TH2 CD4+ lymphocytes , engulfment immature cell without co-stimulatory molecule induces anergy , delete effector T-cells respond present antigen . An increase regulatory T-cells ( T-regs ) also induce ECP may contribute allograft acceptance recipient . ECP also effective treat solid organ transplant rejection improve course various autoimmune disease , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosis , pemphigus vulgaris . Since early 1990s , ECP investigate rescue immunotherapy patient steroid resistant acute chronic GVHD . ECP generally well tolerated Phase II data confirm activity 250 patient steroid-refractory cGVHD . ECP involve isolation peripheral blood buffy coat cell , ex vivo exposure cell 8-methoxypsoralen ( 8-MOP ) ultraviolet-A radiation , subsequent re-infusion treat cell patient . The combination 8-MOP PUVA result DNA crosslinks cause apoptosis . However , direct induction lymphocyte apoptosis unlikely account clinical efficacy ECP give less 10 % circulate leukocyte expose PUVA ECP . The mechanism ECP beyond effect apoptosis induction incompletely understood . Studies date suggest ECP autoimmune condition GVHD stimulate anti-idiotypic response host tissue-reactive T cell clone , attenuate antigen-presenting function type 2 dendritic cell , induces anti-inflammatory cytokine response . In addition , important component tolerance induction think involve expansion Tregs suppress alloreactive mechanism . ECP therapy study two well-defined minor MHC incompatible murine model CD8+ CD4+ T cell mediate GVHD . These study show ECP treat cell could successfully reverse establish GVHD reduce allogeneic response donor effector T cell generate FOXP3+ Tregs donor cell directly expose PUVA , thereby rule mechanistic role direct apoptosis effector cell . The increase Tregs occur early infusion ECP treat cell , remain stable several week , require reduce GVHD mortality BMT . Correlative data human preliminary , one small case series show increase percentage functional Tregs 6 ECP procedure 8.9 % 29 % total circulating CD4+ cell ( p = .05 ) . UVAR Photopheresis System ( Therakos , Inc. , Exton , PA , USA ) approve ECP treatment advance cutaneous T cell lymphoma 1988 Food Drug Administration . In 2009 FDA approval grant indication new Cellex machine .</detailed_description>
