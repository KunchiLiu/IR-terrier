	<brief_title>Evaluation Food Effect Pharmacokinetics Vismodegib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect prandial state pharmacokinetic parameter GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) . II . To evaluate effect fat content meal pharmacokinetic parameter GDC-0449 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect prandial state fat content meal safety profile GDC-0449 . II . To describe anticancer activity GDC-0449 . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive single dose vismodegib orally ( PO ) empty stomach . Beginning 7 day later , patient receive vismodegib PO empty stomach daily day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive single dose vismodegib PO eat high fat meal . Beginning 7 day later , patient receive vismodegib PO empty stomach daily day 1-28 . ARM III : Patients receive single dose vismodegib PO eat low fat meal . Beginning 7 day later , patient receive vismodegib PO eat meal daily day 1-28 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
