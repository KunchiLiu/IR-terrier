	<detailed_description>The principal theme DDHP investigate African-American child main caregiver well oral health others live community . This question dictate design individual project understand determinant oral health disparity . The DDHP follow specific aim : 1 . To promote oral health reduce disparity oral health within community low-income African-American child ( 0-5 year ) main caregiver live City Detroit . This goal address understanding social , familial , biological , neighborhood determinant dental caries periodontal disease , design implement tailored intervention target oral health knowledge behavior access dental care . 2 . To develop multidisciplinary cadre health provider knowledgeable oral health care research City Detroit . 3 . To assist provision dental care service low-income dentally underserved resident City Detroit . The DDHP include three integrate research project center one target population one research project evaluate impact state-sponsored pragmatic experiment access dental care utilization dental service ( Project 4 ) . The DDHP also include one pilot project aim develop new index evaluate impact dental aesthetic employability social acceptance . The research program focus determinants oral health status ( dental caries periodontal disease ) family include least one child le 6 year age baseline ( 2002-2003 ) main caregiver child . The main caregiver individual responsible feeding , bathing , nurture child emotionally , mentally , physically primary home residence . The cohort follow 4 year second assessment ( interviews dental examination ) fourth year six year funding cycle DDHP . The DDHP include follow 4 research project : Project 1 : Socio-cultural determinant , context parent child 's oral health : This project lead Kristine Siefert , MSW , PhD , MPH , Professor , School Social Work , University Michigan . Dr. Siefert contend current research inadequate explain process social location translates poor oral health start early childhood . Without understand process occurs , preventive intervention unlikely succeed . Accordingly , aim research examine influence material social context individual ( e.g. , poverty material hardship , institutional personally mediated discrimination , social cultural support resource ) neighborhood ( Census track , police precinct , City Detroit data ) level , child oral health , mediate moderate effect caregiver parent behavior beliefs . Using ecosocial framework , project focus identify potent modifiable determinant health promotion part parent . To understand context influence parent parent influence outcomes time , project use longitudinal design , take advantage newly develop technique growth curve hierarchical modeling . Data project provide information interaction among social cultural factor caretaking behavior caregiver oral health behavior child risk develop severe dental caries . Project 2 : Lead exposure dietary factor child 's oral health : This project lead Brian A. Burt , BDS , PhD , Professor , School Public Health , University Michigan . This study seek identify relationship lead level , intake dietary fat sugar , dental caries experience disadvantage African-American child , identify variable caregiver relate child 's oral health status . The purpose research identify area successful intervention toward reduce disparity poor oral health better-off peer . The data collect use food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) dental examination caregiver index child . In addition , caregiver ask finger stick blood sample saliva sample ( lead metal assay ) . Blood and/or saliva sample child seek year 4 6 . Participants also measure height weight first subsequent examination . For test hypothesis , outcome severe dental caries experience child , exposures lead level child , sugar fat diet child caregiver . Other variable , demographic information collect study body mass index caregiver child , include multivariate analysis determine relative risk . Nested case-control study , several measure caries outcome , also conduct . The significance study identify area intervention produce unique database African-American population . The 0-2 child 's FFQ , develop study , also valuable tool study child obesity , nutrition , diabetes young African Americans . Project 3 : Efficacy tailor oral health education program : This project lead David Williams PhD , Institute Social Research Jorge Delva PhD , School Social Work , University Michigan . The long-term objective project develop effective tailored behavior change education program promote maintain good oral health prevent oral disease among low-income child caregiver . To achieve , multi-method multi-level intervention target parental behavior belief also contextual determinant oral health behavior identify Project 1 design . Due current lack tailor self-help behavior change dental intervention , substantial time resource need develop content test instrument feasibility propose intervention . This project five specific aim : ( 1 ) To design produce two intervention promote oral health prevent oral disease among caregiver child : ( ) interactive , tailor , theory-driven , behavior change education program , ( ii ) untailored health information ( HI ) comparison program . ( 2 ) To assess feasibility usability unique intervention small-scale feasibility study prior final implementation . ( 3 ) To revise intervention base finding feasibility study implement efficacy trial . ( 4 ) To evaluate efficacy intervention two clinical outcome : gingivitis among caregiver untreated tooth decay among caregiver child . ( 5 ) To examine extent clinical outcome mediate affective , evaluative , situational individual factor influence tailor intervention , broad psychosocial factor address project . The efficacy tailor intervention , whether result well oral health untailored HI intervention , test randomize control trial . In year 4 longitudinal research , participate caregiver randomly assign one two education program begin intervention session . The oral examination year 4 baseline measurement trial , change outcome assess follow-up examination year 6 . The research team mask assignment intervention regimen . Production evaluation state-of-the-science , tailor multi-method , multi-level program oral health provide opportunity obtain currently non-existent information ability influence behavior determine oral health status among low-income African American caregiver child . Project 4 : A pragmatic study new payment system Medicaid : This study , lead Stephen A. Eklund , DDS , DrPH , School Public Health , University Michigan , monitor utilization dental care Michigan child , order evaluate effectiveness recent future SCHIP ( State Children 's Health Insurance Program ) Medicaid initiatives reduce disparity access utilization dental care . Evidence many source demonstrate wide disparity utilization dental care associate socioeconomic status child . Disparities exist measure visit dental care well untreated oral disease . Dental insurance claim data use demonstrate historical pattern utilization disparity privately-insured Medicaid-eligible child . This project specifically investigate on-going program , fund State Michigan , 100,000 Medicaid child eligible privately operate dental insurance program ( Delta Dental Plan Michigan ) . Each Medicaid-eligible child live 37 county Michigan receive dental insurance card ( card hold Delta Dental Plan privately insured beneficiary ) dentist receive 70 80 % reimbursement cost dental care . Future data privately-insured child population Michigan newly-implemented private-insurance base SCHIP Medicaid program Michigan monitor next several year assess ability innovative method payment administration reduce historical disparity dental care utilization . Specific null hypothesis test : 1 ) Payment dental care market rate result difference percent child least one dental visit per year , among child Medicaid , SCHIP , private insurance coverage , 2 ) Payment dental care market rate result difference distance travel receive care , among child Medicaid , SCHIP , private insurance coverage , 3 ) Payment dental care market rate result difference mix service receive among child Medicaid , SCHIP , private insurance coverage . Dr. Eklund 's project project Center focus African Americans live 39 Census Tracts low average family income city . However , research project test important intervention yet implement Detroit area . The analysis Michigan experiment provide evidence whether policy initiative impact access dental care low-income family whether information use develop program specific Detroit .</detailed_description>
