	<brief_summary>The suicidal behavior phenomena eminently multifactorial . It thus always difficult define univocal strategy prevention suicide repetition , emergency stay , i.e . almost general population . One find 23 clinical trial topic past 25 year , 18 negative . The majority positive trial concern dissociate assumption responsibility care strictly speak , adopt position `` méta '' , nearer concept `` case management '' : remain contact suicide attempter , without force every day life , replace possible proposing , assumption responsibility resource reliable quickly accessible event risk situation ? Each one study test device seem appropriate characteristic population , retain simple criterion like sex , number former suicide attempt , proposal assumption responsibility care , observance plan care . Thus , would seem interesting combine approach algorithm entitle `` ALGOS '' . Main aim : To test effectiveness algorithm case management , name `` ALGOS '' , reduce number death suicide , term reduction suicide re-attempts number loss contact patient ALGOS group 6 month period , compare control group suicide attempter treat usual ( i.e . primarily transmit attend physician ) . Secondary objective : To evaluate , accord method validate Beecham 1992 , direct medico-economic impact year follow introduction algorithm ALGOS . Reduction suicidal behavior 6 month ( reduction full number suicidal repetition group , evolution score suicidal ideation , etc… ) . To evaluate effect algorithm , 13th month . To study possible difference within time term suicidal repetition 2 group . To propose different profile answer accord psychopathology , number suicide attempt , suicidal character , sex , … Methodology : Comparative simple blind prospective multicentric control study</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluations : The subject include participate center follow suicide attempt ( SA ) . After check criterion , information signature study consent , subject randomize one 2 group ( ALGOS versus Control ) . A fax inclusion send centralize research team Clinical Investigation Center ( CIC ) Lille . All subject include evaluated 6th month 13th month SA , phone call . The final evaluation carry current 13th month , avoid recontact time period birthday , charge affectively majority patient . This phone call , personal , carry trained psychologist . A mail prevent subject call address approximately 10 day . During evaluation 6th month 13th month , number suicidal repetition report , consumption care since inclusion note , scale suicidal ideation Beck assess , psychopathological evaluation carry ( Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview DSM IV ) .</detailed_description>
