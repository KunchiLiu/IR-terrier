	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate nicotine , withdrawal nicotine , methylphenidate ( drug use treatment ADHD ) affect brain smoker without ADHD task functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner . Study Hypotheses : 1. compare non-ADHD smoker , smoker ADHD exhibit great abstinence-induced decrement response inhibition performance reward great concomitant disruption brain activity 2. administration MPH abstinent smoker ameliorate response inhibition performance reward deficits task-related brain activation effect great among ADHD smoker 3. genetic marker dopamine neurotransmission moderate abstinence- MPH - induced change task-related brain activation across task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals diagnose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) smoke general population , initiate use young age , report difficulty try quit . The overarch goal present application use neuroimaging , neuropharmacological molecular genetic technique study neurobiological basis abstinence-induced deficit response inhibition ADHD non-ADHD smoker . Twenty smoker ADHD 20 smoker without ADHD undergo image Go/No-Go task follow condition : 1 ) smoke usual , 2 ) 24 hr smoking abstinence , 3 ) 24 hr smoking abstinence + methylphenidate ( MPH ) . We hypothesize compare smoking usual , 24 hr smoking abstinence result decrement response inhibition disruption task-related brain activation . These effect great ADHD compare non-ADHD smoker . We hypothesize MPH administration abstinence restore performance brain index response inhibition magnitude effect MPH great among smoker ADHD . In addition aim , preliminarily evaluate moderating effect dopamine receptor D4 7-repeat allele task-related brain activation follow smoke abstinence MPH administration . During study , 101 subject sign consent 38 subject complete study .</detailed_description>
