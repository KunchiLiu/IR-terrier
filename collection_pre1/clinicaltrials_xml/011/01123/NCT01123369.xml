	<brief_summary>To determine retinal choroidal thickness patient sickle cell disease compare age , race match population without sickle cell disease allow good understand clinical manifestation sickle cell retinopathy . The purpose research study evaluate relationship sickle cell disease eye . The research study recruit African American population without Sickle Cell Disease . The investigator charge study Dr E. Bowie . Approximately 60 subject sexes enrol Medical University South Carolina .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>About 10 % African Americans abnormal hemoglobin gene . About 8 % African Americans heterozygous Hb S. In United States , sickle cell anemia primarily occur black population , approximately 0.2 % African American child afflict disease . The prevalence adult low decrease life expectancy . The Storm Eye Institute Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) uniquely situate geographically epidemiologically study interaction sickle cell disease retina . The frequency sickle cell trait ( Hb AS ) African-Americans Charleston County 16 % , twice national average 8 % African-Americans . This thought due autosomal recessive inheritance sickle cell disease , genetic root relative isolation Sea Island Gullah population ( Pollitzer 1999 ) . Variations alteration amino acid sequence globin chain produce variation disease 's expression . The four form disease often refer genotype : sickle cell trait ( AS ) , sickle cell anemia ( SS ) , sickle cell disease ( SC ) sickle cell thalassemia ( SThal ) . Systemically , sickle cell anemia variation ( SS ) produce symptom . With respect eye , sickle cell disease mutation ( SC ) produce effect . The widely accept pathogenesis sickle cell retinopathy vasoocclusion lead retinal hypoxia , ischemia , infarction , neovascularization , fibrovascularization . In sickle cell anemia , amino acid substitution valine glutamate occur beta chain sixth position . This substitution , combine condition may promote sickling ( ie , acidosis , hypoxia ) , trigger deoxygenate Hb S polymerize , make erythrocyte rigid . This rigidity partially responsible vasoocclusion . Vasoocclusion also part due interaction sickled cell vascular endothelium . The adherence sickled cell endothelium trigger inflammatory process release inflammatory agent . The result cascade vascular stasis , hemolysis , vasoocclusion capillary bed . Classically , posterior segment change classify either nonproliferative sickle retinopathy ( NPSR ) proliferative sickle retinopathy ( PSR ) . In NPSR , retinal change involve neovascularization PSR . The use Spectralis HRA+OCT give u visualization individual layer retina determine underlying change see clinically gross ophthalmic posterior segment exam . This knowledge aid care African-Americans sickle cell disease enable great understand ocular disease progression lead early eye screening , possible novel treatment ultimately visual loss prevention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>SUBJECTS approximately 60 subject sexes African American race without sickle cell disease . Patient Subjects MUST fulfill follow condition qualify enrollment trial Twelve year age old . Patients diagnose sickle cell disease ( n=40 ) age , race match control group subject ( n=20 ) without sickle cell disease . Sickle disease define genetic blood disease due presence abnormal form hemoglobin , namely hemoglobin S. It include four genotype : sickle cell trait ( AS ) , sickle cell anemia ( SS ) , sickle cell disease ( SC ) sickle cell thalassemia ( SThal ) . Patients genotype include . Willing able comply schedule visit study procedure Subject must history prior intraocular retinal surgery , prior laser photocoagulation , cryotherapy , active ophthalmic disease abnormality ( e.g . blepharitis , corneal infection ) , clinical evidence trauma ( include scar ) . Any clinically significant , serious severe medical psychiatric condition may increase risk associate study participation may interfere interpretation study result . Participation ( current participation ) investigational drug device trial within previous 30 day prior start date trial . Pregnant nursing mother .</criteria>
