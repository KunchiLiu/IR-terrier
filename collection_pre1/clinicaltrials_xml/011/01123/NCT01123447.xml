	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine surgery use plate screw fix forearm fracture ( ulnar shaft ) improve functional outcome compare non-operative treatment 1 year follow-up . It hypothesize skeletally mature patient isolated ulnar shaft fracture , patient treat surgery improve functional outcome compare non-surgical treatment below-elbow cast 1-year follow-up . This measured Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) score . Secondary outcome include SF-36 , range motion , pain , grip strength , return work , time union .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Surgical Treatment Versus Non-surgical Treatment Ulnar Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ulnar diaphyseal , `` nightstick '' , fracture uncommon , fraught complication ( Pollock et al. , 1983 ; Grace &amp; Witmer , 1980 , Atkin et al. , 1995 ) may prevent return work ( Atkin et al. , 1995 ) . 3 systematic review conclude insufficient evidence guide treatment isolate ulnar shaft fracture ( Handoll &amp; Pearce , 2000 ; Mackay et al. , 2000 ; Bhandari &amp; Schemitsch , 2004 ) comparison operative non-operative management . Therefore , true clinical equipoise regard optimal treatment injury . The aim study determine open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) efficacious close reduction below-elbow cast 6 week restore function forearm wrist . We hypothesize skeletally mature patient isolated ulnar shaft fracture , ORIF improve functional outcome compare non-operative treatment below-elbow cast 1-year follow-up . The primary objective compare Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) score 1-year post-injury . Secondary outcome measure include SF-36 , range motion , pain , grip strength , return work time union . The study design multi-centre , open-label parallel randomize clinical trial . 100 skeletally mature patient close , extra-articular isolated ulnar diaphyseal fracture randomize one two treatment arm . Polytrauma patient pre-existing bone pathology exclude . Post-treatment follow-up evaluation occur 2 , 6 12 week 6 12 month . Interim analysis complete independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee ensure patient safety . Radiologic displacement , angulation time union evaluate two independent , blind observer . Time fracture union define bridge callus across fracture line 2 view . The sample size calculate 50 patient per group . Independent sample t-test use compare DASH SF-36 score return work . An ANOVA use DASH , SF-36 range motion comparison follow-up . There true clinical equipoise regard optimal treatment isolate ulnar diaphyseal fracture , therefore , result trial provide robust evidence clinical decision-making treatment injury orthopaedic surgeon .</detailed_description>
