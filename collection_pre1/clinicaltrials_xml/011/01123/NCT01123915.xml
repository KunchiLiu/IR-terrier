	<brief_summary>This phase I study first step determine Opal immunotherapy may potential utility treatment HIV . Although effective treatment HIV infection exist , limited requirement life-long daily treatment , cost , side effect , development resistance . There need therapeutic approach induce enhance T-cell immunity control HIV disease . Overlapping Peptide-pulsed Autologous Cells ( Opal ) technique autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) whole blood pulse set overlap peptide span whole protein HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Opal-HIV-Gag ( c ) direct injection administer ex vivo incubation whole blood separate blood component ( white blood cell peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) reinfusion . As practical alternative PBMC separation optimise vaccine presentation ex vivo incubation , blood cell separation device use separate whole blood enrich white blood cell component . The device process whole blood close , single use disposable kit . Reconstituted Opal-HIV-Gag ( c ) match placebo add white blood cell , incubate one hour reinfused subject . Subjects receive 4 administration 4 weekly interval . Subjects follow 12 week final administration . Each dose group enrol sequentially , sentinel group dose group . Satisfactory safety data cohort , review Data Safety Monitoring Board , permit dose escalation .</detailed_description>
