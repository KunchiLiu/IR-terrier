	<brief_summary>We hope find safer , noninvasive method measure tumor hypoxia . Hypoxia , mean lack oxygen , associate strongly wide range human cancer . Hypoxia occur tumor growth exceed ability blood vessel supply tumor oxygenate blood . It currently understand hypoxic tumor aggressive . Current method measure hypoxia include invasive procedure tissue biopsy , insertion electrode tumor . EF5-PET may non-invasive way make measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To establish PET image tracer FMISO accurate reliable method measure oxygen content tumor establish measurement secreted marker blood accurate reliable method measure oxygen content tumor .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>3.1.1 Eligible Diseases Any solid tumor malignancy stage meeting follow criterion : Minimum tumor dimension least 1 cm ( ensure detection threshold PET imaging ) . Examples include limited : locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck treat either initial surgery primary chemoradiotherapy ; inoperable nonsmall cell lung cancer pancreatic carcinoma treat stereotactic radiotherapy , may biopsied time percutaneous needle delivery implant fiducial marker . 3.1.2 Allowable type amount prior therapy : Patients newly diagnose malignancy initiate treatment disease participate study . Patients recurrent second malignancy may prior therapy appropriate disease , complete prior treatment least 30 day participation study initiate new treatment current problem . 3.1.4 Patients must great equal eighteen year age . 3.1.5 ECOG Karnofsky Performance Status employ , patient need sufficiently healthy tolerate study procedure . 3.1.6 Requirements organ marrow function applicable study , function need sufficient undergo plan therapy . 3.1.7 Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Pregnant nursing patient exclude study .</criteria>
