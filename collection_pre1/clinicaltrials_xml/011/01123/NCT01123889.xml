	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator initiate study clinically evaluate efficacy new treatment subacromial impingement syndrome partial thickness rotator cuff tear . This treatment consist platelet rich plasma injection around rotator cuff . It think treatment dramatically improve outcome patient suffer two condition . Subjects randomize choose slip paper envelope . This process randomize 25 patient experimental group , 25 patient control . The experimental group undergo blood draw , allow injection platelet rich plasma around rotator cuff . The control group undergo corticosteroid injection subacromial space surround rotator cuff sole treatment . Patients follow three month pain , fill questionnaire six week three month post injection , give insight functionality pain change rotator cuff experience due treatment . Subjects outpatient . Subjects may include employee , student , minority , elderly , although subset form . Subjects 18 89 year age . In total , subject participation last approximately 3 month .</brief_summary>
