	<detailed_description>Epidemiological study show incidence atopic disease ( eczema , food allergy , allergic rhinitis asthma ) rise last decade . The rate increase preclude genetic make-up sole cause atopic epidemic implicates environmental factor instead . Currently , allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) one world 's common chronic allergic disease . It affect 600 million people often lead asthma . There huge cost associate condition term health care work day lose , British business estimate lose Â£324 million summer alone . For sufferer , symptom severely affect quality life . It disturb sleep impairs daytime concentration performance work school . Currently cure . The importance gut microbiota general well-being evidence several experimental observation . It difficult achieve oral tolerance germ-free animal [ Sudo et al . 1997 ] administration lipopolysaccharide ( constituent outer membrane gram-negative bacteria ) together food antigen increase tolerizing effect feed [ Kim &amp; Ohsawa 1995 ] . While able assist tolerance induction , bacterial product may also break oral tolerance [ Gaboriau-Routhiau et al . 1996 ] . These finding lead Wold suggest 1998 alter normal intestinal colonization pattern infancy , fail induce immunological tolerance , could responsible increase allergy . Recent study suggest effect gut microbiota may relate food antigen , also aeroallergens [ Noverr et al . 2004 , 2005 ] . Forsythe colleague ( 2007 ) manage attenuate adverse airway response mouse model allergic asthma oral administration probiotic . The mechanisms probiotic exert effect unknown present , experiment mice document improved gastrointestinal barrier function [ Ewaschuk et al . 2008 ] . Since experiment also reveal strain-dependent heterogeneity efficacy probiotic [ N.G . Hord 2008 ] unlikely improve barrier function alone responsible beneficial effect note . Given sheer number microorganisms inhabit mucosal surface , likely normally bidirectional interaction epithelial , immune , neurologic endocrine physiological process initiate . We hypothesize probiotic organism ingest sufficient quantity amplify particular trait relative milieu organisms present relatively low quantity , temporarily over-riding diversity present . In case , transfer information probiotic organism cellular component gut particular impact . In order understand manipulate probiotic-mucosa cross-talk towards therapeutic advantage , need focus transfer information microbiota cellular component mucosal immune system . Few study examine effect probiotic allergic rhinitis study perform [ Helin et al . 2002 ; Wang et al . 2004 ; Xiao et al . 2006 ] inconclusive . In pilot study test ability Lactobacillus casei Shirota ( LcS ) alter immunological event seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) [ Ivory et al . 2008 ] . The study format double-blinded placebo-controlled ten SAR sufferer group . We compare change immune status arise daily ingestion milk drink supply Yakult , without live LcS , period 5 month . Pre- , peak- post-grass pollen season blood sample collect determination plasma grass pollen-specific IgG IgE level immunoassay . At time , cytokine level determine flow cytometric bead array technology follow culture peripheral blood mononuclear cell six day presence absence specific grass pollen antigen . We find volunteer treat LcS show significant reduction level antigen-induced IL-5 , IL-6 IFN- production compare volunteer supplement placebo . Meanwhile , level pollen-specific IgG increase IgE decrease probiotic group . Other change cytokine level see attain statistical significance , likely due small number volunteer test . Our work establish first time probiotic supplementation modulates immune response allergic rhinitis down-regulation Th1- Th2-type cytokine beneficially alter balance pollen-specific IgG IgE level allergic rhinitis subject . It also suggest impact probiotic reach beyond intestine . We would like conduct another study show immunological change arise probiotic consumption impact clinical symptom hay fever . In addition , propose elucidate mechanism involve may contribute health benefit . As far know similar study date . The ability demonstrate clinical efficacy dietary intervention hay fever treatment obvious benefit relevant sufferer . Economic benefit would arise relatively inexpensive 'treatment ' would self-administered likely low absenteeism work . There also need evidence-based viability many health claim make probiotic consumption could result clear guidance general public .</detailed_description>
