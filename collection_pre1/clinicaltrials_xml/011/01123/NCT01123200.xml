	<brief_summary>The investigator develop tool help people severely paralyzed . This tool call brain-computer interface ( BCI ) . BCIs connect computer electronic device . This study allow person ALS communicate , control wheelchair tilt perform task use BCI , thus increase independence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An In-home Study Brain Computer Interfaces</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This small-scale study feasibility BCI operate tilt position power wheelchair also design determine condition support structure necessary use BCI home . In study , people Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS ) BCI home . They receive train order operate maintain BCI . The BCI allow access least one task primary interest . Task may include communication , computer access , control assistive technology , control wheelchair seat position . Data concerning use BCI collect throughout study . Custom installation make participant connect wheelchair provide communication option need . Each installation expect unique prototype differ control requirement individual wheelchair use participant . We intend enroll six participant , able enroll one .</detailed_description>
