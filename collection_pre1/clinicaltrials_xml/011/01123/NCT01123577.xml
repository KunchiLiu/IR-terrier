	<brief_summary>Background : Hypertension ( HTN ) major risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lead cause death United States New York City ( NYC ) . One 4 NYC adult hypertension , high prevalence Blacks Latinos compare Whites ( Angell 2008 ) . In NYC , 65 % adult HTN treatment control ( Angell 2008 ) . Self-blood pressure monitoring ( SBPM ) associate reduced blood pressure patient hypertension ( Cappuccio 2004 ) . Studies suggest SBPM may increase control either induce clinician titrate medication actively , ( Agency Healthcare Research Quality 2002 ) engage patient participate health care , ( Taylor 2007 ) combination two . However , minimal research do evaluate effectiveness SBPM different racial and/or ethnic group low income population discern effective pattern SBPM use patient . Best practice integration self monitor HTN regular treatment also yet establish . Objectives : The goal study assess impact SBPM condition consistent exist community health clinic resource infrastructure NYC 's medically underserved neighborhood use commonly available automate home BP monitor . By use community clinic 's electronic health record ( EHR ) automate BP monitor capability transmit reading research database , facilitate rigorous evaluation pilot SBPM intervention ass pattern home monitor use clinical management association outcomes . The three specific aim intervention : 1 . Assess whether use SBPM reduces elevate BP increase HTN control similar level two historically understudied minority population , Blacks Latinos . 2 . Confirm pilot finding assess impact SBPM BP HTN control compare usual care use randomize controlled trial methodology . 3 . Develop standard refine guidance effective use SBPM easily communicate key stakeholder .</brief_summary>
