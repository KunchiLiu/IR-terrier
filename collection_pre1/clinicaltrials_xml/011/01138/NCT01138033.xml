	<detailed_description>This study Phase I dose escalation study subject solid tumor . Part 1 identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use dose-escalation procedure . Following identification MTD , enrollment Parts 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 may concurrent . Part 2 explore safety , PK , tolerability , anti-tumor activity GSK2256098 subject tumor know overexpress focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) . Part 3 characterize range biologically effective dos assess pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker hair , skin tumor tissue dos go low 80 mg MTD dose level test Phase 1 dose escalation . Part 4 explore safety , PK , tolerability anti-tumor activity GSK2256098 subject relapse glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . The primary objective study determine safety , tolerability , MTD GSK2256098 . Secondary objective characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) GSK2256098 ; identify range biologically active dos ; explore anti-tumor activity GSK2256098 , explore relationship GSK2256098 PK , PD clinical endpoint . Subjects solid tumor receive GSK2256098 orally without interruption consecutive day . The planned start dose Part 1 total daily dose 160 mg administer 80 mg twice daily ( BID ) repeat dose phase study . In first cohort , administration study drug initiate single dose ( 80 mg ) Day 1 follow collection PK sample . Subjects may begin repeat dose ( 80 mg BID ) Day 2 follow collection 24-h PK sample . In subsequent cohort , administration study drug give single dose ( half total daily dose ) Day 1 follow collection PK sample . Subjects may begin repeat dose Day 2 follow collection 24-h PK sample . During dose escalation ( Part 1 ) , modify accelerate dose titration design follow standard 3+3 dose escalation design MTD establish . After MTD establish approximately 30 additional subject tumor report FAK over-expression enrol explore safety , tolerability clinical activity GSK2256098 ( Part 2 ) . Additional cohort MTD may expand explore characterize range biologically effective dos ( Part 3 ) . Part 4 explore safety , PK , tolerability anti-tumor activity GSK2256098 subject relapse glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) . Part 5 investigate time course , extent apparent change PK GSK2256098 follow repeat dose , screen potential CYP3A induction possible mechanism reduce systemic exposure GSK2256098 Day 15 later time point .
