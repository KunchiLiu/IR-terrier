	<brief_summary>High blood pressure ( hypertension ) important cause myocardial infarction stroke . High blood pressure often occur people overweight . These people frequently also abnormal fat sugar metabolism . The combination problem call 'metabolic syndrome ' . People hypertension obesity currently receive drug therapy people hypertension , without obesity . Different class drug think equally effective lower blood pressure . Next lower blood pressure , hypertension treatment additional effect , like change blood vessel function ( ability dilate constrict ) change metabolism sugar fat . Particularly patient metabolic syndrome , additional effect think great importance , influence risk cardiovascular disease . The blood pressure lower mechanism differs class blood pressure lower medication . The purpose study compare effect three type blood pressure lower medication belong different class . The main outcome interest blood vessel function ( ability dilate constrict ) blood pressure . Moreover , effect treatment additional outcome , like metabolism sugar fat , study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment obesity relate hypertension ( ORH ) challenge become important global health problem . According guideline , class antihypertensive equally effective treatment hypertension . However , guideline base evidence study patient essential hypertension , without specific focus ORH . There increase body evidence complex pathophysiological mechanism ORH . Adipose tissue dysfunction commonly regard common soil eventually cause regulation sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) renin-angiotensin-system ( RAS ) . Moreover , development hypertension closely related development endothelial dysfunction , dyslipidemia disorder glucose metabolism . The investigator hypothesize treatment antihypertensive direct regulation SNS ( moxonidine ) RAS ( aliskiren ) result beneficial effect treatment diuretic ( hydrochlorothiazide ) , latter reduces blood pressure inhibition sodium resorption , without influence underlying disease mechanism . The main outcome interest endothelial function blood pressure , many secondary outcome study .</detailed_description>
