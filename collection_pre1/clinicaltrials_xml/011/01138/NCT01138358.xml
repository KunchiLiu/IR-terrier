	<brief_title>Study Episodic Breathlessness Patients With Lung Cancer Other Advanced Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To explore experience episodic breathlessness patient advanced disease ( i.e. , primary secondary lung cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] , chronic heart failure [ CHF ] , motor neuron disease [ MND ] ) . - To explore impact episodic breathlessness daily live . - To explore individual coping strategy reduce burden episodic breathlessness . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo 1 2 interview collect data experience breathlessness ( general , rest , exertion include symptom description , interpretation , mean ) ; experience episodic breathlessness ( EB ) ( rest exertion include symptom description , interpretation , meaning , definition ) ; trajectory/course EB ( onset/relief , time , severity ) different types/trajectories EB ; impact EB ( burden , emotional reaction [ panic fear ] , care burden , dependency ) ; trigger EB ( cause , situation , setting ) predictability EB ; management EB ( cop strategy , non-pharmacological pharmacological management [ include different application ] , worsen/relief , role care cop , emotional/behavior strategy ; view experience services/professionals management EB response professional advice ; attitude towards future , course disease , awareness prognosis . At end interview , patient ask draw figure illustrate trajectory episode . After interview , debrief carry give patient chance express worry , potential harm , comment interview . In addition interview , information collect include demographic , diagnosis co-morbidities , current pharmacological non-pharmacological treatment ( medical history ) , functional status ( Karnofsky ) , breathlessness characteristic ( e.g. , intensity , frequency , duration ) . The interview tape-recorded , transcribed verbatim , analyze concurrently use Framework Approach .</detailed_description>
