	<brief_summary>The study investigation novel immunotherapy , SCIB1 , treatment melanoma . SCIB1 solution plasmid DNA molecules express modify antibody human cell . The antibody modification design stimulate patient 's immune T cell strong specific reaction melanoma cell eliminate . SCIB1 inject muscle use device simultaneously deliver electrical impulse enhance transfer SCIB1 muscle cell . The trial ass safety tolerability SCIB1 , safety performance injection device immunological effect SCIB1 . This first study SCIB1 humans trial two part , first part dose escalate determine safe tolerable level maximum 8 mg per dose . In second part patient receive dose determine first part . Patients stage III IV melanoma , HLA type A2 life expectancy least three month . All patient receive 5 injection SCIB1 5.5 month . At discretion investigator , patient may continue receive SCIB1 3-6 month interval 5 year . The study conduct major cancer centre UK expect last seven year . Patients follow five year complete trial .</brief_summary>
