	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer remain major public health issue , fourth common cancer second lead cause cancer death worldwide . In Korea , gastric cancer common cancer men , second common cancer woman , second lead cause cancer death . Despite development early gastric cancer detection program , two-thirds patient diagnose gastric cancer develop unresectable disease . Even patient operable tumor evidence high rate local distant recurrence . In case advanced gastric cancer , median survival rate 9 10 month . Additionally , overall 5-year survival rate le 25 % Korea Japan . Several combination regimen chemotherapy gastric cancer develop , survival advantage appear marginal , worldwide standard regimens yet establish . Recently , meta-analysis conducted evaluate efficacy tolerability chemotherapy patient advance gastric cancer . The analysis chemotherapy versus best supportive care ( Hazard Ratio/HR = 0.39 , confidence interval ( CI ) 95 % 0.28-0.52 ) combination versus single agent , mainly 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , ( HR = 0.83 , 95 % CI 0.74-0.93 ) demonstrate significant OS result favour chemotherapy combination chemotherapy . Several chemotherapeutic drug , include 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , mitomycin C , nitrosoureas , doxorubicin evidence level efficacy advance gastric cancer . However , majority combination chemotherapy regimens advanced gastric cancer evidence overall response rate range 30 50 % phase II study . Furthermore , new regimen include use taxanes irinotecan improve either response survival phase II III trial docetaxel , cisplatina infusional 5-FU ( DCF ) combination . Oxaliplatin , third-generation platinum analogue , diaminocyclohexane platinum form interstrand DNA adduct , differ form cisplatin carboplatin term capability overcome resistance mechanism . FOLFOX-4 FOLFOX-6 combination regimen demonstrate response rate 38 % -50 % first-line treatment gastric cancer . Irinotecan ( CPT-11,7-ethyl-10- [ 4- ( 1-piperidino ) -1-piperidino ] semi-synthetic plant alkaloid obtain Camptotheca acuminate Nyssaceae family . After conversion active metabolite , SN-38 , irinotecan act inhibit eukaryotic enzyme , DNA-topoisomerase I. Single-agent irinotecan evidence response rate 13-23 % case advance gastric cancer . 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) Topoisomerase I inhibitor-based regimen demonstrate response rate 20-29 % , suggest first-line treatment advance gastric cancer . FOLFOX follow FOLFIRI reverse sequence treatment regimen use standard treatment modality metastatic colorectal cancer . The study design evaluate safety efficacy FOLFOX follow FOLFIRI reverse sequence treatment regimen first-line second line therapy patient relapse metastatic gastric cancer similar colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
