	<brief_summary>This research do yet know dose foretinib combination lapatinib give safely patient breast cancer , type severity side effect result combination two treatment . This research also do clear addition new drug foretinib treatment lapatinib offer good result longer survival treatment lapatinib alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Foretinib Combination With Lapatinib Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find dose foretinib safely give combination lapatinib . This do starting dos drug low usual dos give . Patients give foretinib lapatinib watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , patient ask join study give high foretinib lapatinib . Patients join study later get high dos foretinib lapatinib patient join earlier . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give .</detailed_description>
