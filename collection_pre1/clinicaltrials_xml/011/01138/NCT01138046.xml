	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-randomized , multi-center study lapatinib plus paclitaxel evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy Japanese patient ErbB2 express advance metastatic breast cancer . Lapatinib 1500mg/day administer combination paclitaxel 80mg/m2/week . Lapatinib paclitaxel administer disease progression withdrawal study due unacceptable toxicity . The study proceed two phase . The first phase ( Phase I part ) lead evaluate safety tolerability lapatinib take together paclitaxel first 6 subject . Pharmacokinetic profile also evaluate secondary object . Then study move next treatment phase ( Phase II part ) evaluate safety clinical activity , major safety concern raise Phase I part . The primary objective study evaluate overall survival ( OS ) , secondary objective Objective tumour response rate ( ORR ) , Duration response , Time response , Clinical benefit Progression-free survival ( PFS ) 12 subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Lapatinib Combination With Paclitaxel 1L Chemotherapy ErbB2-positive MBC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm , Phase I/II study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability weekly paclitaxel lapatinib subject ErbB2-overexpressing advance metastatic breast cancer receive prior therapy metastatic disease . These subject receive weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 IV 3 week 4 week cycle ) plus lapatinib ( 1500 mg daily ) . Subjects receive daily dose lapatinib disease progression withdrawal study treatment due unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent . Subjects treat paclitaxel standard 6 cycle , may continue discretion investigator . If subject experience progression , unacceptable toxicity relate paclitaxel , termination lapatinib therapy , paclitaxel therapy must terminate time study period , even 6 cycle paclitaxel give . This study consist Phase I Phase II part : Phase I part Tolerability pharmacokinetics 6 subject evaluated Phase I part study tolerability criterion set follow : Tolerability criterion first cycle ; Concerning safety tolerability trial , 1 6 first enrolled subject meet tolerability criterion , study proceed phase II part regimen judge well tolerable . If 2 subject meet tolerability criterion , sponsor consult safety review committee . GSK finally judge base consultation regard tolerability medical significance . Grade 4 hematologic toxicity . Thrombocytopenia le equal 25,000/mm3 Grade 3 4 clinically significant non-haematologic toxicity . Inability start cycle 2 within 2 week schedule dose due unresolved toxicity . For 6 subject enrol , safety profile occur cycle 1 closely monitor individually . When consider appropriateness study continuation , safety profile note cycle 1 study , also safety profile report pilot part EGF104578 study relevant study refer order make medical decision . Phase II part After tolerability 6 subject enrol Phase I part confirm , 6 subject enrol Phase II part ( i.e . total 12 subject ) . Subjects receive daily dose lapatinib disease progression withdrawal study treatment due unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent . All 12 subject follow survival .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Prior write consent participate study subject his/her private attorney . Japanese female &gt; =18 year age . Invasive breast cancer stage IV disease . Documentation local laboratory ErbB2 status immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) amplification fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) . If taxane administer neoadjuvant adjuvant setting , progression must occur &gt; 12 month completion treatment patient recover associated toxicity . Measurable lesion ( ) accord RECIST criterion . Radiotherapy palliative treatment painful metastatic disease permit must stop within 2 week prior initiation investigational treatment . For patient whose disease ER+ and/or PR+ one follow criterion meet : Patient visceral disease require chemotherapy ( e.g. , patient liver lung metastasis ) . Rapidly progress life threaten disease consider inapplicable hormonal therapy , determine investigator . Patients receive hormonal therapy longer benefit therapy hormonal treatment must stop first dose investigational treatment . Subjects recover associated toxicity prior endocrine therapy . Eastern cooperative oncology group ( ECOG ) Performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Able swallow retain oral medication . Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram . MUGA scan accept case echocardiogram perform inconclusive . Adequate organ function . Pregnant lactating female anytime study . Received prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy antiErbB1/ErbB2 therapy metastatic disease . History malignancy . Prior therapy ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 inhibitor , trastuzumab , adjuvant setting . Planned concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy ) take investigational treatment . Used investigational drug within 30 day five halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational treatment . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior anticancer treatment . Uncontrolled infection . Patients least positive antibody either HBs HBc . Patients positive HCV antibody . Peripheral neuropathy grade 2 great . Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Known history clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety . Known history concurrent condition uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure . Concurrent treatment prohibit medication . Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate paclitaxel lapatinib excipients . Have current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) .</criteria>
