	<brief_summary>Rationale : Consuming Plant Sterols ( PS ) fortify food widely accept easy apply , life-style change combat modestly elevate plasma cholesterol concentration . PS typically formulate PS fatty acid ester ( PSE ) margarine . In study , PS formulate new innovative type spread . To confirm new spread result comparable cholesterol absorption inhibition reference product dual isotope cholesterol study plan , prior large efficacy study . Primary objective : Cholesterol absorption inhibition ( % ) calculate plasma concentration vs. time curve label cholesterol , PS PSE containing product , compare control product without PS PSE . Secondary objective : PK parameter cholesterol derive plasma concentration vs. time curve . Study design : Acute , single dose , double-blind , randomize , cross-over . Study population : 18 healthy , non-obese men ( BMI 20-27 kg∙m-2 , age range 20 - 65 yr ) Test product : PS ( 2250 mg ) formulate innovatively process spread ( 30 g ) ; PSE ( 2250 mg PS ) reference product ( 30 g ) ; Control product without PS PSE ( 30 g ) Intervention : Three study period single dose either Test , Reference Control ( regular light spread ) spread consume together standard breakfast . At study period , 50 mg D7-cholesterol add meal 30 mg 13C-cholesterol injected measure cholesterol absorption . Before four time consumption spread , blood sample take 24 h interval 7 day . Key parameter : Enrichments label cholesterol isotope determine GCMS IRMS . Fractional absorption determine ratio two isotope plasma cholesterol 7 day .</brief_summary>

Concomitant medication may modulate gastrointestinal secretion pH ( e.g . antacid , protonpumpinhibitors , prostaglandin , anticholinergic agent , H2receptor antagonists ) 30 . Concomitant medication alter gastric emptying ( e.g . metoclopramide , cisapride , domperidone erythromycin , anticholinergic , tricyclic antidepressant , narcotic analgesic , adrenergic agent , calcium channel blocker ) 31 . Concomitant medication alter intestinal transit ( e.g . loperamide , chemical/ osmotic/bulk laxative ) , influence satiety/energy intake ( e.g . sibutramine , gluco¬corticoids , anabolic steroid ) 32 . Intolerance allergy test product .</criteria>
