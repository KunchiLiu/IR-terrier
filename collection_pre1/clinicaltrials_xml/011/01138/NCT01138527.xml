	<brief_summary>The primary objective prospective multi-centre study prove diagnostic accuracy vivo 3T multi-modality Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( high resolution T2-weighted MRI , DCE-MRI , MRSI DWI technique ) distinguish carcinoma prostate tissue . The gold standard distinguish tissue type analysis whole-mount section resect prostate genitourinary histopathologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Localization With Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Goal Proving multi-parametric MR image multi-centre setting allow localize clinically significant ( volume &gt; 0.5cc ; Gleason &gt; 6 ) prostate carcinoma prostate . Objective 1 To determine diagnostic accuracy ( area receiver-operating characteristic curve ) 3-Tesla multi-modality non-endorectal coil ( ERC ) MR image localize prostate cancer , correlate : 1. focal area low signal intensity T2-weighted image ; 2. extent degree deviate metabolite ratio derive MRSI . This choline+creatine/citrate ratio possible , choline / citrate ratio ; 3. extent degree apparent diffusion coefficient reduction DWI ; 4. extent degree perfusion abnormality DCE-MRI ; presence absence cancer ( reconstruct ) whole mount section histopathology . Objective 2 Proving multi-modality MR data allows predict tumor grade . The parameter different MR method tumor focus correlate local Gleason grade correspond lesion histopathological specimen .</detailed_description>
