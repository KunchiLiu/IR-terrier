	<brief_summary>The primary objective study measure LDL apheresis affect level inflammatory cholesterol marker human being . The investigator address question draw pre- post-LDL apheresis blood patient undergoing procedure . A secondary objective study learn specific inflammatory marker behave blood term time rebound back normal level . The investigator address question draw post-LDL apheresis blood predetermine time interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Low-density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) Apheresis Inflammatory Lipid Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous epidemiological investigation demonstrate importance cholesterol - specifically low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - development progression atherosclerosis . A continue relationship cholesterol level coronary morbidity establish . The initial approach manage elevate cholesterol include lifestyle intervention , namely eat low fat diet , weight loss overweight patient , regular aerobic exercise . Once lifestyle intervention apply , pharmacologic therapy become mainstay therapy , conventionally statin follow adjunctive medicine indicate . Certain population refractory aggressive pharmacotherapy , however - patient familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) - necessitate alternative mean lipid management . Therapeutic consideration patient include LDL apheresis number rare procedures partial ileal bypass , liver transplantation , portocaval shunting , possibly gene therapy future . The anti-inflammatory effect LDL apheresis effect endothelial function well know . Considering several pathway atherogenesis , inflammation central mechanism thereof , LDL apheresis may theoretically provide synergistic benefit lipid lower well proinflammatory agent lower lead significantly decrease atherogenesis . This study look address question assess effect LDL apheresis inflammatory lipid marker .</detailed_description>
