	<brief_summary>It hypotheses 1 ) readily available Emergency Department data utilize Atrial Fibrillation clinical prediction rule identify patient low high risk adverse outcome ; 2 ) Assigned risk utilized drive physician decision-making identifying patient require hospital admission ( low risk ) patient need hospitalization ( high risk ) ; 3 ) facile version AFPR easily incorporate standard Emergency Department patient management system assist physician risk stratification patient present Atrial Fibrillation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AF : Impact Present Future National Health Over 2 million people United States Atrial Fibrillation , common sustain arrhythmia.1 That number patient expect increase 5.6 million 2050.1 Atrial Fibrillation associate 4-5 fold increase risk stroke , 3-fold increase risk heart failure 1.5-1.9 increase risk death.2-6 The prevalence Atrial Fibrillation increase individual age ; 5.9 % 65 year age 9 % 80 year diagnose arrhythmia.25 The lifetime risk development Atrial Fibrillation estimate 1 4 men woman forty year age older.26 The proper management patient AF critical due well-documented association heart failure stroke.2-6 , 11 , 27 . The number Emergency Department visit complaint related Atrial Fibrillation increase 88 % 1993 2003 account approximately 1 % percent Emergency Department visit United States.7 , 24 More 65 % Atrial Fibrillation visit result hospital admission $ 6.65 billion expenditure , include $ 3.88 billion hospitalization , $ 1.53 billion outpatient treatment nearly $ 240 million prescription drugs.8 , 24 Patients primary admission diagnosis AF mean length stay hospital charge 4 day $ 7000 1999.28 Over past 20 year , admission rate Atrial Fibrillation increase 66 % .29-31 The combination increase Atrial Fibrillation prevalence , unnecessarily high admission rate Emergency Department crowd likely severely burden healthcare system .</detailed_description>
