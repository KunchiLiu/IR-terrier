	<detailed_description>Inflammation common individual chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) hemodialysis ( HD ) . HD may lead increase inflammatory response number mechanism ; factor also result pro-inflammatory cytokine release consequently cause overlap anemia , accelerate atherosclerosis inflammation . HD-related inflammation mainly due underlie kidney disease , coexist comorbidities , uremia per se , dialyzer membrane biocompatibility contaminate dialysis fluid . Accordingly , HD patient chronically expose microinflammation result blood-membrane interaction dialysis fluid contamination . Among factor , biofilm formation contaminate dialysis fluid closely related enhance immune activation HD patient . Furthermore , dialysis fluid quality controllable preventable . Therefore , correct rHuEPO poor response reduce cardiovascular ( CV ) event , prompt u conduct prospective randomize control study explore whether heat disinfection link HD water treatment system effectively prevent biofilm formation , ensure dialysis fluid purity , subsequently improve patient outcome , term CV event mortality .</detailed_description>
