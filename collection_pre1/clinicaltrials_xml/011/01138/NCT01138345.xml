	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor understand well patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research study study biomarkers blood sample old woman stage I , stage II , stage III breast cancer finish primary therapy breast cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To measure compare normalize p16^INK4a gene expression woman ≥ 65 year age stage I-III breast cancer complete primary therapy comprising surgery without radiotherapy follow endocrine therapy ( cohort 2 ) versus surgery without radiotherapy follow chemotherapy without endocrine therapy ( cohort 3 ) . - To measure compare normalize p16^INK4a gene expression woman ≥ 65 year age stage I-III breast cancer complete primary therapy comprising surgery without radiotherapy ( cohort 1 ) versus woman treat cohort 2 . - To compare normalized p16^INK4a gene expression cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 versus age-matched contemporaneous control group healthy volunteer accrue separate study ( cohort 4 ) . Secondary - To access functional status ( ability live independently home community ) , co-morbid medical condition , cognition , psychological status , social function support , medication review , nutritional status , health-behavior status patient . Tertiary ( exploratory ) - To compare methodology p16 ^INK4a gene expression measurement 50 patient order develop batchable analytically validate assay eliminates need rapid sample processing . - To explore association p16^INK4a expression amount vigorous physical activity , smoke habit , and/or weekly alcohol consumption . - To explore association p16^INK4a expression type chemotherapy receive , co-morbidities , concomitant medication , and/or tumor characteristic . - To correlate p16^INK4a expression score select domain Geriatric Assessment ( i.e. , cognitive function , activity daily live ( ADL ) , instrumental ADL . OUTLINE : Breast cancer survivor healthy volunteer undergo blood collection p16^INK4a gene expression analysis Taqman RT-PCR . Breast cancer survivor complete Health Behavior Geriatric Assessment Questionnaires . They also complete Timed Up Go test determine physical mobility . Medical chart review record information diagnosis treatment .</detailed_description>
