	<brief_summary>This study Phase 1 dose-escalation open-label study determine recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) regimen combination orally administer MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 orally administer AKT kinase inhibitor GSK2141795 . The study consist two part . Part 1A identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use Zone-Based , modify 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure . The start dose ( Zone 1 , Cohort 1 ) 0.5mg GSK1120212 combine 25mg GSK2141795 . Dose escalation continue base predefined parameter MTD establish . The initial regimen dose escalation Part 1A continuous oral daily dosing . Once continuous daily dose MTD RP2D establish Part 1A , Part 1B explore alternate dosing schedule ( ) dose schedule may adjust either GSK1120212 GSK2141795 . Dose escalation proceed use 3 plus 3 dose escalation procedure MTD RP2D alternate schedule define . Part 2 explore specific tumor type safety , tolerability , clinical activity , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) property combination GSK1120212 GSK2141795 recommend dose ( ) regimen ( ) identify Part 1 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Part 1 Dose Escalation Subjects eligible enrollment study must meet following criterion : Male female 18 year old , time signing informed consent . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis solid tumor malignancy responsive standard therapy approve curative therapy subject refuse standard therapy ( Part 1A ) . Part 1B subject must confirm diagnosis one following ( document lab result confirm mutational status must available Screening ) : colorectal cancer ( CRC ) : KRAS mutation nonsmall cell lung ( NSCLC ) : KRAS mutation Pancreatic : mutational status specify Endometrial : mutational status specify Ovarian : mutational status specify Squamous cell carcinoma head neck : mutational status specify BRAF wild type melanoma ( preferentially enrol Part 2 ) BRAF inhibitor failure melanoma . This include BRAFmutant melanoma either initially refractory BRAFinhibitor therapy OR Initially respond BRAFinhibitor therapy eventually develop documented radiographic progression BRAF inhibitor therapy Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) ( preferentially enrol Part 2 ) NOTE : Subjects meet one category describe molecular evidence suggest benefit study drug may consider enrollment discussion GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor . Performance Status score 0 1 accord Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale . Able swallow retain oral medication . Must agree collection blood sample evaluation circulate free DNA ( cfDNA ) ( Part 1B Part 2 ) . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] great 40 MlU/ml estradiol le 40 pg/ml [ le 140 pmol/L ] confirmatory ) . Females hormone replacement therapy [ HRT ] whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method Section 8.1.1 wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 7.3.2 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Additionally , woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 14 day prior first dose study medication . Female subject must agree use contraception four week last dose study medication . Note : Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction use combination alternative method outline Section 8.1.1 . Male subject must agree use one contraception method list Section 8.1.2 . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication four month last dose study medication . Adequate organ system function define protocol . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 X 10 ninth/L Hemoglobin great equal 9.5 g/dL Platelets great equal 75 X 10 ninth/L Prothrombin time ( PT ) / International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Partial Thromboplastin Time ( PTT ) less equal 1.1 X ULN Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 x ULN ( isolate bilirubin great 1.5 x ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin le 35 percent ) AST ALT less equal 1.5 X ULN Albumin great 2.5 g/dL Creatinine le equal ULN OR Calculated creatinine clearance great equal 30 mL/min OR 24hour urine creatinine clearance great equal 30 mL/min Fasting Serum Glucose les 126mg/dL Cardiac Ejection fraction great equal low limit normal ( LLN ) ECHO Inclusion Criteria Part 2 Expansion Cohort : Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed diagnosis one following : Triple negative ( estrogen receptor ( ER ) / progesterone receptor ( PR ) / human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) ) breast cancer locally advance metastatic set BRAFwild type melanoma . Based emerge data , subject tumor histology may require meet specific genetic selection criterion criterion felt improve likelihood give subject respond study drug ( ) . If occur , site Investigational Review Board ( IRB ) notify change constitute protocol amendment . Known Phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) status tumor . At least 6 subject enrol Stage 1 tumor type PTEN deficiency least 6 others PTEN wild type . If subject 's tumor PTEN status previously determine acceptable , analytically validate assay ( i.e. , Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) , sequence , copy number analysis ) PTEN IHC Screening need repeat purpose enrollment study . However , archival tumor tissue tissue fresh biopsy specimen submit confirmation PTEN status central laboratory use IHC . If PTEN status previously determine , archival tissue previous tumor biopsy specimen must available PTEN IHC analysis ; archival tissue available find contain tumor tissue , fresh biopsy require obtain tumor tissue test . Subjects Part 2 previously diagnose Type 2 diabetes must also meet additional follow criterion : Diagnosis diabetes great equal 6 month prior enrolment HbA1C le equal 8 percent Screening visit Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting follow criterion must enrol study : Chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy , anticancer therapy include investigational drug within 28 day 5 half life , whichever short prior first dose one investigational drug describe study .
