	<brief_summary>The primary objective study identify group woman early stage breast cancer likely benefit treatment selective progesterone receptor modulator ( SPRM ) mifepristone . This do treating woman briefly prior plan surgery examine decrease growth rate ( measure Ki-67 immunohistochemistry ) tumor sample take exposure mifepristone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Testing Anti-Progesterone Mifepristone Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Secondary objective study include ; ( 1 ) Measuring objective response tumor size treatment , ( 2 ) Establishing safety tolerability short term mifepristone exposure early stage breast cancer patient , ( 3 ) Performing exploratory study expression relate target follow drug exposure . Anti-estrogen therapy mainstay breast cancer treatment three decade . It highly effective modest toxicity , certainly comparison chemotherapy . The selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen long history number aromatase inhibitor anti-estrogen fulvestrant also widespread use along ovarian ablation pre-menopausal woman . Given success approach , highly analogous parallel progesterone signal , unfortunate anti-progesterone therapy similarly pursue . Additionally , data Woman 's Health Initiative trial reveal potentially significant role progesterone breast cancer development growth . Healthy postmenopausal woman treat combination estrogen progesterone 5 year period 24 % likely develop invasive breast cancer large tumor diagnosis . Notably effect see post-hysterectomy woman treat estrogen alone nearly 7 year . In fact non-statistically significant reduction breast cancer incidence observe estrogen alone . The anti-progesterone mifepristone find reduce proliferation normal breast tissue . Even low dose mifepristone ( 50mg every day 3 month ) demonstrate statistically significant reduction breast cell proliferation ( measure Ki-67 immunohistochemistry ) . Higher dose mifepristone , 200mg daily , use patient metastatic breast cancer duration almost 2 year without serious toxicity . Response rate 11 % grade 4 5 toxicity occur . Some grade 3 toxicity occur , include lethargy , nausea , vomit , skin rash . These rash resolve temporary discontinuation drug recur drug resume . As whole data strongly support research anti-progesterone therapy early stage breast cancer . To knowledge first study .</detailed_description>
