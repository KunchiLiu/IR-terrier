	<detailed_description>This study Phase II single arm , open-label , multicenter , ( people involve know identity intervention ) study 50 HIV-1 infected adult patient , receive ETR 400mg darunavir ( DRV ) /r 800/100mg give orally daily . This trial design evaluate efficacy aforementioned ARV regimen , measure percentage patient HIV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) &lt; 50 copies/mL 48 week , early treatment-experienced HIV-infected patient . In addition general safety parameter measurement , trial also assess change metabolic , inflammatory , immune restoration , bone marker . Screening occur 6-week period . The trial schedule include Baseline Visit ( Day 1 ) , Open-label Treatment Phase ( Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48/ Early Withdrawal ) Post-treatment Phase ( 4 Week Follow-Up ) visit . In addition , patient two pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample draw Weeks 4 24 , A single PK sample drawn Weeks 12 , 36 , 48 ( early withdrawal visit ) . There also substudy conduct 24 hour intensive PK week 4 subset patient . For patient consent , genotyping CYP2C9 CYP2C19 perform Baseline . A Modified Medication Adherence Self-Report Inventory ( M-MASRI ) questionnaire collect , patient-reported survey assess adherence medication take . The primary endpoint assess Week 48 , treatment period 48 week . The end study endpoint meet either complete Week 48 visit , early termination study reason . ETR 400mg daily 48 week DRV 800mg daily 48 week .</detailed_description>

CD4 count = 50 cells/mm3 . Primary HIV1 infection Previously document HIV2 infection Use disallow concomitant therapy Any condition ( include limit alcohol drug use ) , , opinion investigator , could compromise patient 's safety adherence protocol Life expectancy le 6 month accord judgment investigator Patient currently active AIDS defining illness ( Category C condition accord Center Disease Control [ CDC ] Classification System HIV infection 1993 follow exception , must discuss sponsor prior enrollment : Stable cutaneous Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( i.e. , pulmonary gastrointestinal involvement oral lesion ) unlikely require form systemic therapy trial period Wasting syndrome due HIV infection , investigator 's opinion , actively progressive treatment require hospitalization compromise patient 's safety compliance adhere trialrelated procedure . If patient maintenance therapy ( may include Growth Hormone , appetite stimulant anabolic steroid ) previously diagnose waste syndrome , he/she may eligible trial . Note : An AIDS defining illness clinically stabilize least 30 day consider clinically active . Note : Primary secondary prophylaxis AIDS defining illness allow case medication use part disallow medication Any active clinically significant disease ( e.g. , pancreatitis , cardiac dysfunction ) finding screen medical history , laboratory physical examination , investigator 's opinion , would compromise patient 's safety outcome trial .</criteria>
