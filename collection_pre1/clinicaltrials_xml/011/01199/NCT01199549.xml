	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) continue rank high among lead cause morbidity mortality adult worldwide . While diet increased physical activity constitute primary preventive health approach , role plant-based bioactive compound attract much attention due unique cardio-protective benefit . Several epidemiological study suggest dietary pattern characterize relatively high intake fruit vegetable significantly associate reduced risk coronary heart disease stroke . Dietary bioactive compound potent anti-oxidants anti-inflammatory agent , thereby counteract oxidative damage inflammation , underlie pathogenesis CVD . However , area really lack good set chemistry , bioavailability efficacy data vital nutrition researcher doctor emphasize role prevention treatment clinical outcome different stage CVD , dissemination information general public . Cambridge Theranostics focus effort develop product prevent damage oxidation lipoproteins lead heart attack stroke , understand cause damage . Extensive literature show Lycopene , Resveratrol Soy Isoflavones key ingredient diet long know reduce risk heart attack stroke . However , normally poorly absorb ( 'bioavailable ' ) . The investigator unique production process present Lycopene , Soy Isoflavones Resveratrol body form easily absorb use . The aim current study perform compare bioavailability absorption three different dietary antioxidant combination . The study fund Cambridge Theranostics do healthy volunteer various age 30 people product group . It conduct primacy Cambridge Theranostics Babraham Research Campus . And manage team experience professional employ Cambridge Theranostics . The study last 12 month include recruitment process , screen process , periodical blood sample collection examination statistical analysis end .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>90 volunteer , fulfill inclusion criterion , meet exclusion criterion , give write informed consent enter study . Lab assay statistical analysis data perform plasma sample subject complete study accord study protocol partially complete study evaluable data . Subjects recruit subject pool CTL database . The study perform daily 8 week dose , open label , three arm study 90 subject . The study consist three group one treatment period , wash-out period 4 week prior study . All evaluable data suppose use safety evaluation . The subject take product main meal daily . At certain time point ( T0 - study , T1 - 1 week treatment , T2 - 2 week treatment , T3 - 3 week treatment , T4 - 4 week treatment , T8 - 8 week treatment ) overnight fast 11 hour subject invite lab blood sample collection . Blood sample analysis serum concentration Lycopene , Resveatrol Soy Isoflvones shall draw . Two aliquots sample prepare . One aliquot frozen serum sample ship analytical lab bioanalysis Lycopene , Resveatrol Soy Isoflvones . Other aliquot retain CTL 's lab . A total 7 blood sample collect product intake . Analytical laboratory Institute Food Research , Norwich , perform measurement concentration Lycopene , Resveatrol Soy Isoflvones use validated LC-MS/MS method . Calculations pharmacokinetic parameter assessment bioavailability carry product CTL . The final report include aspect concern clinical part study , bioanalysis , statistic discussion obtain data well legal ethical requirement .</detailed_description>
