	<brief_summary>Protective airway reflex may impair postoperative period , create potential aspiration gastric content , even patient exhibit appropriate response command . Because assessment airway reflex recovery possible intubated patient , clinician must make empiric decision patient safe extubate , choose combination technique least likely result pharyngeal impairment . Adequacy reversal neuromuscular block cholinesterase inhibitor ( e.g. , neostigmine ) unpredictable , especially presence profound paralysis , tactile assessment train-of four sustain tetanus show poor correlation objective assessment . Protective airway reflex may also impair early recovery anesthetic , even muscle relaxant avoid . In absence muscle relaxant investigator previously demonstrate patient receive anesthetic high tissue solubility , sevoflurane show significantly great impairment swallow 14 minute response command compare patient receive anesthetic low tissue solubility , desflurane . Therefore , ask whether combination soluble anesthetic presence neuromuscular block antagonize neostigmine may create multiplicative effect might prolong pharyngeal recovery . We plan randomly assign 100 patient schedule undergo surgery general anesthesia standardize anesthetic include 1 ) sevoflurane , rocuronium 70 µg/kg neostigmine + 14 µg/kg glycopyrrolate antagonism ( group S ) ; 2 ) desflurane , rocuronium 70 µg/kg neostigmine + 14 µg/kg glycopyrrolate antagonism ( group D ) . Airway reflex recovery judge adequate patient 's ability swallow 20 mL water without cough drool 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 60 minute response command . Anesthetic ( sevoflurane desflurane ) discontinue administration reversal agent recovery TOF ( train-of-four ) ratio 0.7 .</brief_summary>
