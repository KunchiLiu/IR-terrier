	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study side effect well give paclitaxel without viral therapy work treat patient ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Viral therapy may able kill tumor cell without damage normal cell . Giving paclitaxel together viral therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel With Without Viral Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival hazard ratio combination weekly paclitaxel Reolysin ( wild-type reovirus ) weekly paclitaxel alone patient persistent recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event associate treatment weekly paclitaxel alone weekly paclitaxel REOLYSIN assess Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival overall survival patient treat weekly paclitaxel alone weekly paclitaxel REOLYSIN . II . To estimate ( compare ) proportion patient respond regimen arm study ( accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 measurable patient cancer antigen [ CA ] -125 patient detectable disease ) . III . To characterize compare progression-free survival overall survival patient measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 criterion ) patient detectable ( non-measurable ) disease . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . ARM II : Patients receive paclitaxel arm I wild-type reovirus IV 1 hour day 1-5 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
