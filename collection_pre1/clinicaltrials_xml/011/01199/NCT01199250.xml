	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess frequency spectrum mutation fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) low- , intermediate- , and/or high-risk endometrioid endometrial cancer GOG-0210 . ( Project 1 ) II . Determine relationship FGFR2 mutation clinicopathologic variable include disease-free overall survival low- , intermediate- , and/or high-risk endometrial cancer GOG-0210 . ( Project 1 ) III . Identify cognate FGF ligands receptor express normal endometrium endometrial cancer , examine expression multiple tissue microarrays GOG-0210 determine association clinical outcome . ( Project 1 ) IV . Identify epigenetic biomarkers ( differential methylation CpG island locus ) associate recurrence disease progression endometrioid endometrial cancer Washington University School Medicine ( WUSM ) . ( Project 2 ) V. Confirm epigenetic biomarkers ( differential methylation CpG island locus ) associate recurrent disease progression endometrioid endometrial cancer GOG-0210 . ( Project 2 ) VI . Define performance ( sensitivity specificity ) epigenetic biomarkers associate recurrence disease progression endometrioid endometrial cancer independent cohort case GOG-0210 . ( Project 2 ) VII . Develop molecular screen regimen compliment family history risk assessment identify carrier Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer ( HNPCC ) -related form inherit endometrial cancer GOG-0210 ascertain family history . ( Project 3 ) VIII . Estimate prevalence HNPCC-related form inherit endometrial cancer GOG-0210 . ( Project 3 ) IX . Define relationship defective DNA mismatch repair clinical epidemiological factor GOG-0210 . ( Project 3 ) X . Determine clinicopathologic significance mismatch-repair defect include association disease-free overall survival GOG-0210 . ( Project 3 ) XI . Assess expression five candidate ERK1/2 substrates normal endometrium , primary endometrial cancer ( WUSM GOG-0210 ) endometrial cancer cell line determine substrate phosphorylation ERK-dependent . ( Project 4 ) XII . Determine relationship ERK substrate-phosphorylation status upstream ERK-signaling pathway activation primary endometrial cancer WUSM GOG-0210 . ( Project 4 XIII . Determine clinicopathologic significance ERK substrate expression primary endometrial cancer WUSM GOG-0210 . ( Project 4 ) XIV . Explore GSK3/3 inhibition therapeutic treatment endometrial cancer ass role inhibit ERK substrates endometrial cell line . ( Project 4 ) XV . Explore predictive prognostic accuracy panel single nucleotide polymorphism alone informative clinical , surgical , pathologic variable cohort Caucasian woman stage IB IC v IIIC endometrioid endometrial cancer WUSM GOG-0210 . ( Project 5 ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Previously collect sample analyze biomarker laboratory analysis .</detailed_description>
