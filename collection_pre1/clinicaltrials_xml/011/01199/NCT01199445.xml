	<detailed_description>Iron , zinc vitamin A deficiency particularly common among child young woman develop country South Southeast Asia . Rice common staple large part sub-regions Asia . In spite wide range rice variety eat , rice eaten age group one first food use complementary food infant . Fe fortification rice use method heat extrusion micronized ferric pyrophosphate ( FePP ) iron fortificant show efficacious increase iron store reduce prevalence iron deficiency Indian school child . Subsequent extrusion trial show promising result respect color vitamin A ( VA ) stability rice grain triple fortified Fe , Zn vitamin A . Preliminary data region Satun , South Thailand , show zinc vitamin A intakes low . Biochemical indicator confirm zinc deficiency suboptimal vitamin A status 1/3 school age child . Since rice main staple food area , rice triple fortify Fe , VA Zn promise strategy combat micronutrient deficiency child . The aim study demonstrate whether triple fortified rice impact vitamin A status child . The study conduct school child ( 8 12 year old ) . The child randomize either receive daily lunch rice meal prepare fortified rice ( triple fortify rice grain mixed natural rice ratio 1:50 ) non-fortified rice 60 day . As serum retinol concentration , widely use indicator assessment vitamin A status , reliable indicator due homeostatic control influence infection , addition use tracer methodology use dilution stable isotope total body vitamin A pool size estimate prior intervention 60 day intervention..</detailed_description>
