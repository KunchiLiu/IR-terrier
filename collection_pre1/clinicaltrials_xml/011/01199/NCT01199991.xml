	<brief_summary>Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) currently widely use tool determine bone density . However , expert consider DXA imperfect intermediate technology . DXA subject artifact arthritis body composition , also account geometric material property bone also important component bone strength . Xtreme CT ( high-resolution peripheral quantitative compute tomography , HR-pQCT ) new technology dramatically improve spatial resolution . It able define bone ' cortical trabecular surface three-dimensional manner , therefore provide information bone microarchitecture well bone density . As , may provide new information characteristic bone strength . The purpose study compare Xtreme CT DXA measurement bone density , also generate normative database healthy young adult . This cross-sectional study involve single visit Xtreme CT DXA measurement obtain single time-point . This normative database allow u generate clinically relevant comparison two image technology .</brief_summary>
