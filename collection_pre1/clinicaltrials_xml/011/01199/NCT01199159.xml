	<brief_title>Preoperative Misoprostol Reducing Blood Loss Total Abdominal Hysterectomy ( TAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma common benign tumour affect woman reproductive age . Around 20-50 % cause symptom warrant treatment . Different medical therapy , include gonadotrophin release hormone analogue , mifepristone , progestins androgen try . However , medical therapy significant side-effects would allow short-term treatment . Total abdominal hysterectomy definitive treatment large , symptomatic fibroid . Operative mortality total abdominal hysterectomy rare . However , operation may associate significant morbidity . Significant operative blood loss require blood transfusion oral iron supplement uncommonly encounter total abdominal hysterectomy . Various method try reduce operative blood loss total abdominal hysterectomy . A course hormonal therapy month operation aim shrink size fibroid ( ) reduce vascularity common approach . Although effective , significant side effect cost gonadotrophin release hormone analogue high . Intramyometrial vasopressin injection report , serious complication report . Misoprostol , prostaglandin E1 analogue , widely use clinical practice obstetrics gynaecology . It stimulate uterine contraction increase myometrial contraction lead contraction vessel supply blood leiomyoma . Misoprostol also show increase uterine artery resistance reduce blood flow leiomyoma . Study Celik et al show pre-operative misoprostol reduce intra-operative blood loss need post-operative blood transfusion abdominal myomectomy . Chang et al investigate use misoprostol oxytocin laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy find combination pre-operative misoprostol intra-operative oxytocin reduce blood loss 200 ml . As misoprostol stimulate uterine contraction reduce uterine blood flow , base hypothesis pre-operative misoprostol may redistribute blood diseased uterus back circulation hence reduce operative blood loss total abdominal hysterectomy , use double-blind randomized control trial investigate whether single dose sublingual misoprostol total abdominal hysterectomy +/- salpingo-oophorectomy symptomatic uterine leiomyoma reduce operative blood loss need post-operative blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
