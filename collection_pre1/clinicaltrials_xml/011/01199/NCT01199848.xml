	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether compound find strawberry ( polyphenolics typically find berry product , tea , coffee , red wine , chocolate ) help reduce insulin resistance inflammation , know factor blood associate disease risk , eat standard high fat/carbohydrate meal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Strawberries Disease Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main study single-center , randomize , cross-over , 4-arm , dose-response , single- blind , 6-hour postprandial study evaluate ability strawberry powder block meal-induced oxidative stress inflammation concomitantly improve postprandial insulin sensitivity glucose handle . A planned sample size 45 recruit study . Thirty subject main study 15 subject complement study . Subjects participate study subject participate study , time gap main study complement study due volume blood permit collect within 56 day . The complement study 2-arm placebo control study follow exact protocol main study , use one strawberry dose ( Dose 3 main study ) compare effect relative placebo control fiber . The main study take 5- 6 week per subject complete complement study take 1-2 week per subject complete , depend subject 's schedule . The procedure conduct screen visit include blood sample finger prick fasting blood sugar test anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , waist circumference ) , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure heart rate ) completion series questionnaires relate volunteer ' general health eat habit . Volunteers may ask complete oral glucose/sugar tolerance test ( OGTT ) screening . Volunteers exempt OGTT procedure qualify condition present . Briefly , subject undergoing OGTT ask drink glucose drink ( similar taste kool-aid ) morning 10 hour fast . Blood glucose finger prick do 1 hour 2 hour determination glucose tolerance . If OGTT necessary , additional compensation provide . If qualify , subject undergo 7-day pre-study period ask record usual diet intake 3 day , include 2 weekday 1 weekend day , EITHER follow randomization 1 4 treatment beverage sequence main study : Placebo ( Pbo ) , Strawberry Dose 1 , Strawberry Dose 2 Strawberry Dose 3 , OR follow randomization 1 2 treatment ( Placebo without fiber Strawberry Dose 3 ) beverage sequence complement study . We expect difficult eliminate severely restrict polyphenolic diet entire study period , therefore subject ask limit berry product intake study period . However , subject ask limit polyphenolic food diet 3 day prior study visit . All subject consume standard high fat/ carbohydrate meal ( know induce oxidative- inflammatory- stress ) accompany 1 4 test beverage ( whole milk shake without strawberry powder ) four separate occasion main study OR 1 2 test beverage two separate occasion complement study , subject serve control . Subjects arrive study visit fast least 10 hour , well hydrate rest . Each study visit require blood draw throughout visit . After pre-study procedure ( height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure , blood glucose finger prick ) fasting , register nurse ( RN ) place catheter ( flexible tubing ) subject ' arm purpose draw blood . This catheter remain throughout study day . Approximately 1 tablespoon blood take time . The test meal strawberry shake serve thereafter subject blood draw ( 1 T time ) designate time point next 6 hour . Each visit last approximately 7 hour subject require remain Clinical Nutrition Research Center IIT Campus duration visit . Blood sample collect designated time point postprandial period analysis metabolic ( insulin glucose homeostasis ) , oxidative inflammatory endpoint marker .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible volunteer must meet ONE MORE criterion ( number 14 ) associate insulin resistance along criterion list ( number 59 ) : 1 . Blood glucose concentration between140199 mg/dL 2hr OGTT . 2 . Elevated fast glucose ( ≥110 mg/dL &lt; 126 mg/dL ) 3 . Elevated fasting insulin ( &gt; 75th percentile cutoff 13.13 μU/mL ) 4 . Insulin resistance define homeostasis model assessment method insulin resistance ( HOMAIR ) ( glucose [ millimoles per liter ] × insulin [ microunits per milliliter ] /22.5 ) value least 2.5 . 5 . Waist circumference &gt; 102 cm ( men ) &gt; 88 cm ( woman ) screen visit invitation many epidemiology study show waist circumference may relate insulin resistance . 6 . Nonsmokers 7 . Not take medication would interfere outcomes study , i.e . lipid lower medication , antiinflammatory drug , dietary supplement 8 . 18 year age old 9 . No clinical evidence cardiovascular , metabolic , respiratory , renal , gastrointestinal hepatic disease Pregnant and/or lactate Allergy intolerance strawberry dairy product . Current regular consumption strawberry &gt; 2 serving per day . Fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL . Subjects identify elevated fast blood glucose level advise contact primary care physician appropriate followup care . Taking counter antioxidant supplement supplement may interfere study procedure endpoint . Subjects unusual dietary habit ( e.g . pica ) . Actively lose weight try lose weight ( unstable body weight fluctuation &gt; 5 kg 60 day period ) . Excessive exerciser train athlete . Subjects document atherosclerotic disease , inflammatory disease , diabetes mellitus , systemic disease . Addicted drug and/or alcohol . Medically documented psychiatric neurological disturbance . Smoker ( past smoker may allow cessation &gt; 2 year )</criteria>
