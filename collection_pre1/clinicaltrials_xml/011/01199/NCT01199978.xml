	<brief_summary>In research study look another type radiation call proton radiation know spare surround normal tissue radiation . The proton radiation deliver use fractionate stereotactic radiotherapy ( FSRT ) improve localization small tumor target . Proton radiation delivers minimal radiation beyond area tumor . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience conventional radiation therapy . In research study , look determine effect fractionate proton radiotherapy long-term hearing preservation control tumor growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Proton radiation deliver daily approximately 5.5 week . Participants assess weekly side effect may experience . - Participants follow-up visit 6 month last proton radiation treatment every year time treatment completion 5 year . The following test procedure perform visit : medical history , physical exam , MRI scan , comprehensive hearing test questionnaire .</detailed_description>
