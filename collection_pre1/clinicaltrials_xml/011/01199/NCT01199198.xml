	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Tolvaptan design help raise salt level blood remove extra body water urine . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . You equal chance assign either group : - If Group 1 , take tolvaptan receive standard care - If Group 2 , take placebo receive standard care patient hyponatremia . A placebo tablet look like study drug active ingredient . You know group assign . However , need safety , able find receiving time . Study Drug Administration : You take tolvaptan placebo 1 time every day mouth 14 day . If receive placebo , also receive standard care hyponatremia . Examples standard care include limit water fluid intake , give salt tablet drug diuretic . Your doctor describe detail . You give drug diary record take study drug/placebo .
