	<brief_summary>The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Research Consortium ( CRC ) conduct two-arm , multi-center phase II trial Revlimid® rituximab Relapsed Refractory CLL patient age 65 patient 65 year old . Lenalidomide ( Revlimid ) immunomodulatory agent promise clinical activity CLL FDA approve treatment relapse multiple myeloma 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome . Rituximab ( Rituxan ) monoclonal antibody CD20 approve treatment CLL . The primary objective study determine overall response rate combination Revlimid® rituximab previously treat CLL patient . All patient receive treatment Revlimid® start low dose dose escalate base individual patient tolerability . The combination Revlimid Rituximab administer maximum 7 cycle . Patients residual leukemia follow seven cycle treatment combination may elect continue protocol additional 6 cycle single agent Revlimid® consolidation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Research Consortium ( CRC ) conduct two-arm , multicenter phase II trial Revlimid® rituximab Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) patient age 65 patient 65 year old . Revlimid® ( lenalidomide ) derivative thalidomide immune-modulating property . Revlimid® FDA approve treatment relapse multiple myeloma 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome . Revlimid® promise clinical activity , previously treat treatment naive CLL early clinical trial . However , mechanism ( ) whereby Revlimid® active CLL unknown . Rituximab ( Rituxan® ) monoclonal antibody bind CD20 express normal leukemia B cell . Rituximab approve treatment CLL . In preclinical model lymphoma Revlimid improved activity Rituximab . In clinical study relapse and/or refractory CLL combination Revlimid Rituximab associate well therapeutic effect compare historically observe either agent alone . The purpose study evaluate safety activity combination Revlimid® rituximab relapse refractory CLL , elucidate mechanism action Revlimid® CLL , ass whether prognostic factor might predict patient likely benefit therapy future . The primary objective study determine overall response rate ( ORR ) combination Revlimid® rituximab previously treat CLL patient age 65 year younger 65 . Secondary objective evaluate safety combination Revlimid® Rituximab , response duration , improvement hematologic parameter , activity combination high-risk CLL subset , significance tumor flare reaction compare activity regimen administer previously treat patient protocol front line set compare outcome arm study . All patient receive treatment Revlimid® start low dose slowly dose escalate base individual patient tolerability . The combination Revlimid Rituximab administer maximum 7 cycle . Patients residual leukemia follow seven cycle treatment combination may elect continue protocol additional 6 cycle single agent Revlimid® consolidation . All patient baseline assessment know CLL prognostic factor CRC tissue core . These know prognostic feature CLL together novel prognostic factor evaluate ability predict response treatment Revlimid® combination Revlimid® Rituximab .</detailed_description>
