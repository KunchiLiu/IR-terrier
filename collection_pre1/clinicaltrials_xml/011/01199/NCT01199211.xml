Using echocardiogram characterize early determinant `` athletic remodeling '' . We also assess effect intense physical training lipid metabolism , focus HDL subspecies function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Left ventricular hypertrophy , define increase mass leave ventricle may occur physiologic response exercise ( athletic remodeling aka `` athletic heart '' ) , frequently encounter pathological manifestation cardiovascular disease . The early determinant athletic remodel general population largely unknown . In order longitudinally explore early determinant athletic remodeling , recruit community , physically untrained woman volunteer run marathon . We prospectively assess leave ventricular mass function echocardiogram three consecutive stages/visits : - Baseline : prior start intense physical training - Trained : end least 12 week training period , prior run marathon . - Post-marathon : 6 week run marathon . In addition , exercise impact lipid metabolism short-term exercise know increase HDL level plasma . Human HDL structurally heterogeneous , comprise least sixteen discrete specie . It multiple function , pertinent cardiovascular medicine ability accept effluxed cholesterol artery wall , culminate sterol uptake liver . This `` reverse cholesterol transport pathway '' think prevent accumulation cholesterol artery wall . We assess clinical genetic determinant HDL response physical exercise .</detailed_description>
