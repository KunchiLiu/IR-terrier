	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) give together temozolomide radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose malignant glioma . Enzyme inhibitor , gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 , may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 together temozolomide radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose/recommended phase II dose RO4929097 combination temozolomide radiotherapy patient glioblastoma malignant glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics RO4929097 give combination temozolomide ( correlative study C1 ) . II . To evaluate brain tumor penetration RO4929097 give recommend phase II single agent schedule give maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination radiotherapy temozolomide ( correlative study C2 ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacodynamic effect RO4929097 resect specimen , comparison specimen obtain untreated patient . II . Effects RO4929097 cancer stem cell population ( correlative study C4 ) . III . Effects RO4929097 angiogenesis ( correlative study C5 ) . IV . To evaluate combined effect RO4929097 , radiation temozolomide explants establish patient ' tumor specimen ( correlative study C6 ) . V. To evaluate effect RO4929097 magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) parameter ( correlative study C7 ) , include dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) MRI perfusion , diffusion weight image volumetric analysis . VI . Preliminary evaluation efficacy treatment regimen : 6 month ( 6m ) median progression-free overall survival , response rate . VII . To evaluate potential biomarkers gamma-secretase Notch inhibition activity ( correlative study C8 ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . PRE-SURGERY TREATMENT : Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 week 1 day 1 week 2 . SURGERY : Patients undergo surgery 2-3 hour administration gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 day 1 week 2 . TREATMENT CONCURRENT WITH RADIOTHERAPY : Beginning 3-4 week surgery , patient undergo conventional focal ( intensity-modulated radiation therapy [ IMRT ] 3-D conformal ) radiotherapy 5 day week approximately 6 week . Patients also receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD approximately 10 week begin day radiotherapy temozolomide PO QD approximately 6 week begin day radiotherapy . ADJUVANT TREATMENT FOLLOWING RADIOTHERAPY : Approximately 4 week completion radiotherapy , patient receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD day 1-28 temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
