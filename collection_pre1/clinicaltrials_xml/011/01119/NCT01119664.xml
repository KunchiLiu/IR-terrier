	<brief_title>Combination Gene Transfer Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) cancer cure . The effective combination chemotherapy , Pemetrexed ( Alimta ) /Cisplatin , yield overall response rate 40 % , improvement overall median survival 3.5 month . Prior Phase I trials intrapleural infusion ( IP ) Ad.hIFN-beta ( BG00001 ) safe . The recent trial IP Ad.IFNalpha ( SCH 721015 ) dose 3e11 viral particle ( vp ) give three day apart safe well tolerate , show high level IFN pleural fluid serum . Our preclinical data model propose study suggest two IP dose Ad.IFN-alpha combination chemotherapy well tolerate markedly enhance efficacy . The purpose new study determine safety administrate intrapleural SCH 721015 ( Ad.hIFN-alpha 2b ) combination chemotherapy management malignant pleural mesothelioma . This study enroll subject pleural mesothelioma . Subjects receive two fixed dose SCH 721015 follow 4-6 cycle chemotherapy . Subjects require placement pleural catheter administration SCH 721015 . Some patient require pleural catheter control pleural fluid place research purpose . Protocol participation 15 year .</detailed_description>
