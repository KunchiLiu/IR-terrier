	<brief_summary>The purpose research study find safe feasible improve appearance quality scar use procedure adipose tissue ( fat ) take part body inject , transplanted scar . This procedure call autologous fat transfer ( AFT ) . The main goal study see AFT safe improve quality appearance scar tissue . Another main goal determine much tissue transplant get best result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before begin study treatment , follow test procedure : - A physical examination - A review medical history . You ask history psychiatric illness . - You ask medication might currently take . In addition , ask alcohol drug use . - Pregnancy test , woman childbearing potential . - Digital photography treatment site . - Scar assessment - ask complete quick simple questionnaire appearance scar well healing/have heal . - Passive Active range motion assessment ( P/AROM ) - If study scar extend joint elbow , finger knuckle , test see well move bend joint study treatment . - After screening , prior AFT procedure , may need undergo additional test . These test may include laboratory assessment , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The requirement additional testing largely depend age , recent surgical medical history , medical condition indicate need test . - Outpatient surgery procedure include anesthesia put sleep ( either without breathe tube ) , medicine give IV ( vein ) , and/or local numbing medicine , lidocaine . You receive ALL usual standard monitoring , medication , safety precaution , care provide patient undergoing surgery , include antibiotic need , pain medicine need ( procedure ) supportive care need . - You 2 treatment site identify AFT study . Under anesthesia , skin biopsy research purpose take prior study procedure designate treatment area . Both treatment sit similar size location body . One sit treat use AFT procedure ; treat use fake procedure ( placebo procedure ) . - The surgeon remove fat tissue skin use standard liposuction method . - This tissue wash concentrate remove unwanted fluid medicine inject designated skin grafts/scars use small needle . - There follow-up visit do 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month AFT procedure perform follow test procedure : - A physical examination - A review medical history - You ask medication might currently take - Digital photography treatment site . - Scar assessment - ask complete questionnaire appearance scar well heal . - Active range motion assessment ( AROM ) - If site span joint , test see well move joint . - As part research study , two skin biopsy take study site ( time treatment , 6 month , 12 month AFT procedure ) . A skin biopsy routine procedure involve obtain small skin sample ( 2-4 mm ) special instrument ( punch biopsy ) cut small circular piece skin . If need , area biopsy take may closed stitch .</detailed_description>
