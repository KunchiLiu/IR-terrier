	<brief_summary>The objective study compare humeral tibial IO needle insertion peripheral IV access cardiac arrest . Hypothesis There difference first attempt success tibial IOs compare humeral IOs peripheral IV among cardiac arrest patient . Methods This randomize control trial conduct within Mecklenburg County Mecklenburg County EMS Agency ( MEDIC ) . The study population include adult ( great 18 year age ) cardiac arrest patient medical etiology upon resuscitative effort initiate . Patient Care Protocols Prehospital protocols adult cardiac arrest patient within Mecklenburg County state first responder follow advanced cardiac life support ( ACLS ) algorithms cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Current MEDIC protocols specify initial vascular access obtain paramedic via either tibial humeral IO needle insertion , follow peripheral IV secondary access . This study randomize initial vascular access humeral IO , tibial IO , peripheral IV . Once paramedics arrive on-scene , take pack ambulance contain necessary supply begin resuscitation . These pack already present ambulance Mecklenburg County contain EZ-IO drill , IO needle , ACLS medication , KING LTD airway device . For purpose study , peripheral IV start kit add resuscitation pack start study implementation . Randomization Process 150 note card prepare advance label vascular access method . [ 50 card `` Tibial IO '' , 50 card `` Humeral IO '' , 50 card `` Peripheral IV '' ] Each note card seal blank , numbered envelope . A master list prepare advance accord envelope number indicate vascular access method place numbered envelope . This list available MEDIC Quality Assurance/Quality Improvement ( QA/QI ) personnel responsible paramedic debrief recirculation unused envelope . Sealed envelope shuffle place MEDIC circulation window resuscitation pack ambulance equipment distribute daily . Each crew randomly select open envelope prior every shift . By open envelope start day , eliminate possibility envelope leave ambulance unit lose scene , well prevent delay patient care . The envelope number record circulation window indicate specific MEDIC ambulance unit assign crew . The vascular access route select apply crew 's first cardiac arrest day . Resuscitation Protocol Paramedics conduct resuscitation accord exist procedure , proceed vascular access follow depend method select randomization : Tibial IO First attempt tibial IO . Second attempt occur opposite tibia first IO fails . Subsequent attempt humeral IO peripheral IV select paramedic . Humeral IO First attempt humeral IO . Second attempt occur tibia first humeral IO fails . Subsequent attempt peripheral IV additional IOs determine paramedic . Peripheral IV First attempt peripheral IV AC . If fails , second attempt tibial IO , follow humeral IO indicate . Since extremely rare crew conduct one cardiac arrest give day , randomize vascular access method apply first cardiac arrest day . As crews return distribution center end shift ( 12 hour ) , impossible select additional envelope subsequent patient encounter . Paramedics proceed vascular access per current MEDIC prehospital protocol cardiac arrest resuscitation day . If contraindication vascular access site select extremity amputation , orthopedic hardware , skin infection , traumatic injury , paramedic proceed next insertion site per protocol . For instance , patient bilateral low extremity amputation randomize tibial IO insertion site , paramedic classify fail attempt proceed humeral IO , peripheral IV state . For patient isolated skin infection orthopedic hardware involve one extremity , paramedic select unaffected extremity first attempt . Any unforeseen circumstance address accord paramedic ' discretion report primary investigator immediately . Such occurrence include final data analysis study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . All cardiac arrest medical nature patient great equal 18 year age occur Mecklenburg county , NC . 1 . Traumatic cardiac arrest different prehospital protocol exist resuscitation involve traumatic arrest ( i.e . motor vehicle accident , motorcycle accident , fall , penetrate injury include stabbings gunshot wound ) . 2 . Cardiac arrest due hemorrhage purpose study , arrest consider `` medical etiology '' since massive blood loss contribute factor rapid volume resuscitation indicate . 3 . Cardiac arrest involve child young adult patient less 18 year age exclude different prehospital protocol exist child cardiac arrest . Age verification occur upon data collection use patient date birth available . Any data collect patient find less 18 year age resuscitation , also exclude data analysis . 4 . Patients establish vascular access prior cardiac arrest patient deteriorate transport cardiac arrest already peripheral IV IO needle establish exclude study . Randomization apply encounter vascular access already select documentation sole provider possible transport . 5 . Patients Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) circumstance , cardiopulmonary resuscitation initially perform patient DNR order produce . These patient exclude study full protocol implement .</criteria>
