	<brief_summary>Meningococcal disease occur throughout world attack rate Sahelian sub-Sahelian region Africa - African meningitis belt - many time higher see part world . During 2009 , 70,000 meningitis case 3,200 death report Nigeria , Niger , Chad alone . In 2001 , public private partnership WHO PATH create , Meningitis Vaccine Project ( MVP ) . The MVP set develop affordable meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine ( MenAfriVac™ ) use African meningitis belt . This successfully achieve , new vaccine , produce Serum Institute India ( SII ) , grant licence 2009 international export . The vaccine dossier submit WHO prequalification begin 2010 . Introduction mass vaccination plan three African Meningitis belt country 2010 ( Burkina Faso , Mali Niger ) . The implementation MenAfriVac responsibility local Ministry Health , support World Health Organization . It anticipate vaccine deployed country meningitis belt 2011 . This vaccine provide high level direct protection immunise individual , serogroup C conjugate vaccine United Kingdom , great public health impact achieve carriage transmission infection also prevent . The London School Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine ( LSTHM ) coordinate African Meningococcal Carriage Consortium ( MenAfriCar ) . One primary objective MenAfriCar project evaluate impact new conjugate vaccine meningococcal carriage transmission serogroup A meningococci Mali , Niger Chad . A community-based prospective , pre- post intervention , observational study conduct . MenAfriCar also help develop research capacity participate African country .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Impact Vaccination With Conjugate Vaccine Meningococcal Carriage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidemiological information obtain community , household individual level . In country , informed consent obtain adult select participate study child care . Written inform assent also obtain participant age 12 15 year . Oral assent obtain young child . Once consent assent obtain , structured questionnaire complete following discussion head household record information sleep cook arrangement household . Each study participant guardian complete questionnaire collect information potential risk factor meningococcal carriage occupation , smoking , recent travel , include travel pilgrimage , attendance social gathering , recent respiratory infection . Following interview , pharyngeal swab obtain study participant . A 5 ml blood sample obtain 200 randomly select subject four old age category 50 infant age 6 - 11 month ( total 850 sample ) initial survey measure serogroup A bactericidal Immunoglobulin G ELISA serogroup A , C , W135 , X Y meningococcal antibody . Blood collect infant age 6 month . In country , immediate processing pharyngeal swab allow identification subject carry meningococci serogroup meningococci determine within 2 - 4 day collection sample . The households subject visit soon possible identification carrier make , informed consent obtain participant agrees , pharyngeal swab obtain twice month two month monthly four month , total 8 follow-up sample estimate rate acquisition loss carriage household 's contact . During first visit , 5 ml blood sample obtain subject age 6 month measurement IgG ELISA bactericidal serogroup A meningococcal antibody determine concentration protect acquisition carriage . No blood sample collect . A rapid diagnostic test malaria perform subject febrile unwell antimalarial treatment provide accord national guideline positive . The result household study show impact vaccination acquisition rate carriage . Similar cross-sectional longitudinal survey describe conduct approximately 6 18 month mass vaccination campaign serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine . AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL STUDY PROTOCOL : The initial proposal include provision interview collect information potential risk factor carriage , collection pharyngeal swab study participant , 8 swab household contact index carrier six-month period . It include provision collection one 5 ml blood sample initial cross-sectional survey 800 subject age 6 month old baseline serological assay , collection 5 ml post-vaccination sample . It also include provision collection 5 ml blood sample subject age 6 month first visit household follow study determine concentration protect acquisition carriage . During pre-vaccination survey conduct 2010 , pharyngeal swab collect 4,300 5,000 age stratify subject Mali Niger respectively . Molecular analysis perform Oxford , confirm serogroup A meningococci among 48 338 isolates putative meningococci identify Mali Niger respectively . In contrast , serogroup A meningococcal carrier identify Chad course relate epidemiological study ( REF.5699 ) . In addition , 2011 African meningitis season , 90 % case serogroup A meningococcal disease record meningitis belt come Chad Cameroun case report Mali Niger . These observation indicate may possible measure impact MenAfriVac™ serogroup A meningococcal Chad rather Mali Niger propose originally . For reason indicate , propose undertake pre-vaccination carriage survey Chad 5,000 subject 2011 rainy season instead 2,000 subject propose originally epidemiological study ( REF . 5698 ) . As prevalence carriage high rural urban area 2010 rainy season survey conduct Chad , propose study 4000 subject two rural area 1,000 subject urban area . This allow comparison make result obtained 2010 rainy season survey 1000 subject recruit urban rural area respectively . The study procedure describe original proposal perform Chad , except blood sample obtain initial survey collect 2010 . However , one blood sample obtain household contact index carrier set survey originally plan Mali Niger . The consent form one propose initially use . Depending upon prevalence serogroup A meningococcal carriage 2011 rainy season survey conduct Chad , decision make whether proceed two post-vaccination survey indicate original protocol Mali Niger . Vaccination whole Chad MenAfriVac™ commence last quarter 2011 whole country likely cover early 2012 .</detailed_description>
