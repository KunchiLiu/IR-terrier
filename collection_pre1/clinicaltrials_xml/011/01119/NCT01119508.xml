	<brief_title>Ipilimumab + Temozolomide Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ability control melanoma depend well immune system recognize attack cancer cell . Researchers want use ipilimumab try trigger immune system response , temozolomide design damage cancer cell . Study Drugs : Ipilimumab design block activity cell low immune system 's ability fight cancer . Blocking cell may help body 's immune system fight cancer cell well . Temozolomide design stop cancer cell make new DNA ( genetic material cell ) . If make DNA , divide new cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin receive treatment ipilimumab plus temozolomide . You intravenous ( IV ) catheter place large vein Ipilimumab . There 2 phase study drug treatment : Induction Maintenance . During Induction Phase , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 3-week Induction `` course . '' You take temozolomide mouth tablet form Days 1-4 course . You receive 4 course Induction therapy . During Maintenance Phase , receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute Day 1 every 12 week . You also take temozolomide mouth 5 day row , every 4 week . You may take Temozolomide dose within 48 hour receive Ipilimumab dose Day 1 Induction Maintenance Phase . You see doctor new course ( every 3 week ) Induction Phase , every 4 week Maintenance Phase . All treatment give outpatient clinic . You give anti-nausea medication decrease risk nausea vomiting , need . Study Tests : Before Each Course : ( Every 3 week Induction , every 4 week Maintenance ) - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test test liver kidney function . - You ask medication take side effect experience . - Women able become pregnant blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . - Your performance status record . - Your vital sign measure Day 1 . Every week , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . At end course , tumor felt hand measure physical exam see shrink . Every 2 course ( +/- 7 day ) , chest x-ray CT MRI scan perform check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If stop receiving study drug reason , End-of-Treatment Visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 14 day stop study treatment , come clinic End-of-Treatment Visit . At visit , follow test perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask medication take side effect experience . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Your may CT MRI scan perform check side effect . Every 2 month 3 year , also contact telephone clinic visit see . This investigational study . At time , temozolomide FDA approve commercially available treatment primary brain cancer . However , use temozolomide treat metastatic melanoma consider investigational . At time , ipilimumab use research . The use drug together also consider investigational . Up 64 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
