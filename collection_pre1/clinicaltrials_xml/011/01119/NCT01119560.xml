	<detailed_description>Study Subtype : Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model : Case-only Time Perspective : Prospective Biospecimen Retention : Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description : Saliva Tissue Study Population Description : Patients already register ACCRN07 Sampling Method : Probability Sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate independent association common genetic polymorphism involve folate , vitamin A , relate metabolic transport pathway risk neuroblastoma ( NB ) . II . Evaluate joint effect multiple gene risk NB . III . Evaluate effect gene-exposure interaction risk NB . IV . Evaluate genetic effect within NB subgroup define age diagnosis Children 's Oncology group classification schema base age , MYCN oncogene status , histology , DNA ploidy . V. Recontact mother participate NENA case child , conduct brief web-based screen ascertain whether pregnancy include index NENA child multiple ( twin , triplet , etc ) , whether mother know child MZ DZ , obtain complete pregnancy history . VI . Request saliva sample twin/multiple sibling NENA child . VII . Extract DNA saliva sample securely store . VIII . Clean new survey data merge main NENA study database . OUTLINE : The biologic mother patient ask complete Diet History Questionnaire diet pregnancy , information demographic , lifestyle factor , medication use pregnancy , history breast feeding , family history cancer birth defect . Parents give ORAgene saliva collection kit self-collection . Saliva bio-specimen sample collect biologic parent patient . Tissue sample previously store tissue bank obtain deceased patient , available . DNA extract sample , amplify analyzed use real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) quantitation assay , genotyped use single nucleotide polymorphism .</detailed_description>
