	<brief_summary>Rationale : The narrow therapeutic range wide inter-patient variability dose requirement make anticoagulation response coumarin derivative unpredictable . As result , patient require frequent monitoring avert adverse effect maintain therapeutic efficacy . Polymorphisms cytochrome P450 2C9 ( CYP2C9 ) vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1 ( VKORC1 ) jointly account 40 % inter-individual variability dose requirement . To date , several pharmacogenetic guide dose algorithm coumarin derivative , predominately warfarin , develop . However , potential benefit dose algorithm term safety clinical utility adequately investigate randomised setting . Objective : To determine whether dose algorithm contain genetic information increase time within therapeutic INR range anticoagulation therapy warfarin , acenocoumarol phenprocoumon compare dose regimen contain information . Secondary outcome study include cost effectiveness , number thromboembolic bleed event , time reach stable dose number supratherapeutic INR peak . Study design : This two-armed , single-blinded , randomise control trial . In one arm ( intervention ) patient commence anticoagulation therapy either warfarin , acenocoumarol phenprocoumon dose accord drug-specific genotype-guided dosing algorithm , base genetic information , clinical data ( monitor phase ) previous INR . For arm ( control ) patient dose accord non-genotype-guided dosing regimen include genetic information . The follow-up period per patient 3 month . Study population : Newly diagnose patient gender least 18 year old need anticoagulant treatment either acenocoumarol , phenprocoumon warfarin within low intensity INR range include trial . Main study parameters/endpoints : The % time within therapeutic INR range first 3 month anticoagulation therapy . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Six extra blood sample take participant start study . Patients also attend 8 schedule visit within 3 month study period ask fill questionnaire . The genotype-guided dosing algorithm anticipate improve accuracy coumarin dose thus improve safety efficacy anticoagulation therapy .</brief_summary>
