	<brief_title>Prenatal Iron Supplements : Safety Efficacy Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency anemia malaria urgent public health problem sub-Saharan Africa , include Tanzania . There paucity good quality randomize trial assess safety efficacy iron supplementation pregnancy , effect perinatal health outcome . Prenatal iron supplementation recommend base demonstrated benefit prevent treat maternal anemia . There limited data efficacy iron supplementation pregnancy outcome , include birth weight . There also concern regard use iron supplementation , particularly among non-anemic woman . In particular , lack research safety efficacy prenatal iron supplementation develop region , characterize extensive burden iron deficiency , malaria , endemic infectious disease . Evidence randomize control trial urgently need examine safety efficacy iron supplement among pregnant woman malaria endemic region , particularly among woman anemic . NOTE : The time frame list maternal malaria hemoglobin outcomes updated 4/22/15 . This record initially indicate maternal malaria anemia hemoglobin would measure several specific time point throughout study . Instead , maternal malaria measure throughout pregnancy hemoglobin measure delivery . Due oversight , update record protocol change take effect start study .</detailed_description>
