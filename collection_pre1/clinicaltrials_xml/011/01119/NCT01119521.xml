	<brief_summary>The purpose research study tuberculosis ( TB ) vaccine , Bacillus Calmette Guérin ( BCG ) . The goal study evaluate whether BCG vaccine effective preventing TB adult give 6 month treatment widely use anti-TB drug , isoniazid ( INH ) . Participants include 82 healthy , tuberculin skin test positive ( TST+ ) , HIV-uninfected , male female volunteer , age 18-40 year . The study conduct Worcester , South Africa . Subjects assign chance 1 2 possible treatment group . Group 1 receive 6 month oral INH treatment follow intradermal ( administered skin ) BCG revaccination one year follow-up . Group 2 observe 7 month follow intradermal BCG revaccination another 6 month follow-up . Then 6 month INH treatment give . Participants involve study procedure 22 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pre-clearance Latent Tuberculosis Infection And BCG Revaccination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase I , single-center , open label , randomize control clinical trial assess effect pre-clearance latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) Isoniazid , isonicotinic acid hydrazine ( INH ) treatment Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) revaccination versus BCG revaccination alone mycobacterial-specific immune response tuberculin skin test ( TST ) positive adult . Subjects initially assign observation prior BCG revaccination receive INH treatment latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) begin six month revaccination . Volunteers include 82 healthy , TST positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -uninfected , male female person age 18-40 year . The primary objective study : determine effect INH preclearance kinetics characteristic specific immune response follow BCG revaccination adult latent MTB infection ( TST positive ) ; determine safety reactogenicity BCG revaccination TST positive adult . The secondary objective study : determine effect INH preclearance BCG revaccination MTB-specific Th1 effector central memory cell function ; determine effect INH preclearance BCG revaccination MTB-specific Treg cell function ; determine effect INH preclearance BCG revaccination innate immune response measure T cell mediate inhibition intracellular mycobacterial growth inflammatory cytokine production . All subject expect enrol 12 month . The duration screening , enrollment , follow-up subject 22 month . Subjects randomly assign receive either : 6 month INH treatment LTBI ( complete within 7 month ) follow intradermal BCG revaccination 7 month observation ( run period ) follow intradermal BCG revaccination follow 6 month observation 6 month INH treatment LTBI . Both group receive BCG vaccination time period . Volunteers evaluate 7 14 day 1 , 3 , 6 and/or 12 month BCG revaccination month INH therapy end study safety , reactogenicity immunogenicity . Blood immunologic study draw study enrollment subject , prior BCG revaccination , 1 , 2 week 1 , 3 either 6 12 month ( depend study arm ) BCG vaccination , month 1 , 3 , 6 INH therapy end study measurement MTB specific T cell response . Both treatment arm follow safety immunogenicity endpoints 12 month BCG revaccination . Immunologic outcomes chosen goal measure characteristic kinetics human immune response follow BCG vaccination support ultimate aim develop method determine biological relevance immune response induce BCG revaccination relevance protection tuberculosis ( TB ) . Overall , study may provide key information characteristic kinetics immune response follow BCG revaccination adult whether affected preclearance INH treatment LTBI .</detailed_description>
