	<brief_summary>The objective study determine weekly dose 17 hydroxyprogesterone caproate ( 17P , Makena® ) give woman preterm rupture membrane : 1. increase probability continue pregnancy favorable gestational age . 2. increase interval randomization delivery . 3. decrease neonatal morbidity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Progesterone ( 17P , Makena® ) Prolongation Pregnancy Women With Preterm Rupture Membranes ( PROM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm rupture membrane ( PROM ) lead identifiable cause prematurity account one-third preterm delivery 18-20 % perinatal death USA . When PROM occur early gestational age , clinician must make decision whether attempt prolong pregnancy whether recommend prompt delivery . Both approach carry substantial risk . The strategy continue pregnancy commonly call `` expectant management . '' During expectant management , gestational age steadily increase , balance naturally shifts toward favor delivery . Once gestational age reach 34 week , risk lethal permanent sequela prematurity minimal , clinician agree delivery warrant . Despite attempt expectant management , majority patient PROM deliver within first week . Unfortunately , intervention antibiotic prophylaxis corticosteroid show prolong latency reduce neonatal morbidity PROM . Recent evidence suggest prophylactic administration progesterone medication may reduce risk preterm delivery woman certain risk factor , notably history prior preterm delivery shorten cervix discover ultrasound examination . Clearly , woman PROM high risk preterm delivery , press need study whether 17 hydroxyprogesterone caproate ( 17P ) effective PROM . Progesterone might beneficial PROM tend promote uterine quiescence suppress formation myometrial gap junction anti-inflammatory property , suppress production inflammatory cytokine thereby inhibit cervical ripening . Inflammation major pathway lead preterm labor , cervical dilation &amp; preterm delivery . 17P would seem like ideal candidate prolongation pregnancy PROM . This double-blinded , placebo-controlled , multicenter , randomize clinical trial 17P versus placebo . The primary outcome measure percentage group reach either gestational age 34w0d documentation fetal lung maturity 32w0d 33w6d . Secondary outcome include latency period group percentage newborn group major neonatal morbidity death .</detailed_description>
