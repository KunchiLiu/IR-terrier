	<brief_summary>The number child undergo MRI image increase significantly past year , many young child stay still duration scan , difficulty tolerate confine space noise produce Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) machine , sedation General Anesthesia require case . In investigator institution , investigator use General Anesthesia child undergo MRI . Because child large surface area body weight ratio ; hypothermia passive heat loss one anesthesiologists ' concern . MRI require cool environment low humidity ; specialize environment represent significant thermal challenge anesthetize child . Since temperature device compatible MRI , simple task measure temperature change never investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It known follow induction anesthesia , core hypothermia occur three stage ; 1 . Redistribution 2 . Linear phase 3 . Plateau phase Redistribution This account large drop core temperature three stage . Vasodilatation cause redistribution heat core periphery . Linear Phase This begin start surgery patient expose cold cleaning fluid cool air flow theatre . Heat loss exceed heat production , surgery extend past linear phase . - Radiation contributes ( 40 % ) proportional environment/core , temperature difference power four . - Convection contribute 30 % proportional air velocity . - Conduction contribute 5 % proportional difference surface temperature . - Evaporation contribute 15 % occur cleaning fluid , skin , respiratory wound . A laparotomy contribute 50 % total . - Respiratory contribute 10 % ( 8 % evaporation water ; 2 % heat air ) enhance cool effect cold anesthetic gas . - Cold intravenous fluid . Plateau Phase Once core temperature fall thermoregulatory threshold , peripheral vasoconstriction increase act limit heat loss core department . When core heat production = heat loss peripheral compartment , core temperature reach plateau . Patients autonomic neuropathy ( diabetic ) impair sympathetic vasoconstriction unable establish core plateau phase 3 . Combined general regional anesthesia similar effect regional anesthetic ( spinal/epidural ) prevent vasoconstriction legs ; i.e . failure establish core plateau . The ability maintain body temperature also compromise anesthesia impairs intrinsic thermoregulatory response . Heating device include fluid warmer bear hugger , commonly use Operating Room theater , incompatible MRI . On hand , MRI produce Radiofrequency Energy transform heat within patient 's tissue . This may partially offset heat loss . The purpose study determine child undergo MRI General Anesthesia become hypothermic whether aggressive measure take prevent passive heat loss MRI study . Study Design This observational , prospective non blind study .</detailed_description>
