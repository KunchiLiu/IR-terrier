	<brief_summary>This primary purpose study evaluation immunological persistence follow completion 3-dose primary vaccination course either clinical commercial lot pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A study NCT00808444 . In addition , study also assess safety , reactogenicity immunogenicity fourth dose pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A ( commercial lot ) co-administered Infanrix-IPV/Hib 18-21 month age child prim study NCT00808444 . The primary vaccination study conduct Malaysia Singapore . The booster vaccination study perform Malaysia since pneumococcal conjugate vaccine GSK1024850A register September 2009 . However , subject Malaysia offer booster dose commercial pneumococcal conjugate vaccine license Malaysia Infanrix-IPV/Hib vaccine second year life accord nationally recommended regimen . Administration booster dose outside set-up clinical trial . Hence data collect , blood sample take Malaysia .</brief_summary>
