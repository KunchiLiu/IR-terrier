	<detailed_description>Lactate , addition find common ferment food today , yogurt , lactate , two stereoisomer form , know D ( dextrorotary ) L ( levorotary ) also produce colon normal fermentative process lactic acid produce bacteria . Both D-lactate L-lactate produce microbe metabolize enzymes within human cell typically pose acid-base risk reduce pH threaten degree healthy individual . However , specific dehydrogenase convert D-lactate pyruvate far less active L-lactate , suggest young infant may vulnerable group D-lactic acidosis . Previous data show urinary D-/L- lactate excretion significantly different 2 group 4 month old infant take control formula formula contain D-lactate produce probiotic 4 week . However , measure collect baby first month birth . In study want test safety D-lactate produce bacteria baby birth 1 month age . This safety study randomize , control , single center , clinical trial 2 group infant . The primary objective clinical trial : evaluate effect starter formula contain D-lactate produce probiotic versus starter formula without probiotic , D-lactic acid urine level healthy formula-fed infant , birth 28 day age . Urinary D-lactate concentration ( mmol/mol creatinine ) , measure ( baseline , 7 day , 14 day 28 day ) . Secondary objective include evaluation effect gut microbiota , gastrointestinal tolerance , duration sleep cry , morbidity growth , follow 6 month age .</detailed_description>
