	<detailed_description>Patients admit hospital pain crisis may eligible study . In addition , patient 12-60 year old sickle cell type SS S-beta-thalassemia . People take part study evaluate randomly assign receive either GMI-1070 placebo IV , addition usual treatment pain crisis . During hospital stay pain crisis , GMI-1070 placebo give twice day , patient ask pain severity ( pain score ) beginning study every hour hospital stay . Their general health , vital sign , lab test , pain medication also check regular basis hospital stay .
