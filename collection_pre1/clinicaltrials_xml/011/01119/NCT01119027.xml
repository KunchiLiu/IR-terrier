	<detailed_description>In study investigator use objective evaluation system deconstruct laparoscopic colectomy component step . Critical component procedure well overall operative performance evaluate . This applied surgeon trainee surgeon attend laparoscopic colorectal training course use different training model compare model correlate outcome model pre-course experience . This project aim well educate trainer get good information validity new training model laparoscopic colectomy . Aims Project - To observe assess surgical technique laparoscopic colorectal skill train course use previously validate tool formal assessment surgical technical skill . - To evaluate technical error pattern error training laparoscopic colectomy . - To determine outcomes error rate different training model correlate prior surgical experience . Number participants/subjects research : Subjects recruit several site : - principal investigator facility University Hospitals Cleveland Case Medical Center , surgeon outside institution visit regularly training course - Society American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons ( SAGES ) Laparoscopic colorectal training course , surgeon participate course invite faculty national meeting ( PI national Program Director run course ) . - American Society Colorectal Surgeons ( ASCRS ) Laparoscopic colorectal training course , surgeon participate course invite faculty national meeting ( PI national Program Director run course ) . Course attendees informed start appropriate laparoscopic course study perform . The study explain detail give copy appropriate paperwork review . Verbal consent request . It explain feel pressure participate study , participate data use evaluation . The number case component case perform related participation non-participation trial . Study Design This observational study trainee ' technical surgical skill evaluate perform specific step laparoscopic colectomy case , outline accompany datasheets . The plan enroll 200 participant . At completion case , form complete trainee , teach / supervise surgeon . Independent observer use , attend laparoscopic colorectal surgeon adequately skilled score resident perform case , feasible second attend surgeon present case . Dr Delaney score trainee possible use standardized form . For course University Hospitals Case Medical Center ( UHCMC ) , colorectal faculty instruct standardized assessment , also assess trainee . For course SAGES ASCRS , course faculty show train assessment direct standardized assessment prior evaluation .</detailed_description>
