	<detailed_description>1 . Utility Urgent Upper Endoscopy Setting Na√Øve Dislodged PEG Tubes define : - Percentage Open vs. Closed Gastrotomy upon urgent endoscopy - Presence Incidental Pathology note Endoscopy - Complications Urgent Endoscopy - Time Procedure 2 . Technical Feasibility NOTES procedure determine : - Number Successful/Failed PEG Placements - Number Patients Requiring intra-operative conversion laparotomy laparoscopic procedure - Time Complete Procedure - Presence absence post-procedural contrast extravasation completion contrast radiographic study 3 . Efficacy NOTES PEG Rescue compare historical control characterize follow post-operative criterion : - Number Patients Requiring Subsequent Medical Surgical Treatment Intra-Abdominal Abscess - Number Patients Requiring Subsequent Medical Surgical Wound Infection within 30 post-op day - Post-Operative CT Operative Findings consistent abscess confirm culture positive drainage , aspiration - Intra-Operative Post-Operative Red Blood Cell Transfusion - Length Stay - Antibiotics &gt; 24h Post-Op - 30 day Re-Admission - Mortality</detailed_description>
