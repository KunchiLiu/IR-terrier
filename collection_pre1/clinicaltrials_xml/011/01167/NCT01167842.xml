	<brief_summary>This study analyze tumor tissue patient know genetic mutation ( BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CHK2 , etc ) tumor tissue available two surgery , either primary/recurrent , two different anatomical site .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Tumors From Patients With Inherited Cancers Having Had Two Surgeries ( Primary + Recurrent , 2 Separate Types Cancer )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit individual know BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation mutation similar cancer cause gene CHK2 PALB2 cancer remove surgery biopsied two time available pathological block . We wish enroll individual one surgery biopsy cancer allow u obtain tumor block one time point . Such patient would include one cancer recur one separate cancer . We conduct brief interview subject obtain personal information medical treatment history . In addition , collect clinical information treat physician ( ) correlate molecular finding clinical response treatment survival recurrence data . We collect background clinical information family history information copy genetic test result document cancer cause mutation . We recruit patient know BRCA1 BRCA2 mutation know mutation cancer cause gene CHK2 PALB2 perform genetic test non-tumor tissue new information genetic susceptibility patient sample . Enrolled subject donate blood sample obtain locally ship research laboratory , cost entirely cover research group .</detailed_description>
