	<brief_summary>Treatment option patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) often limited . In case , amenable local therapy include surgery radiofrequency ablation . The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib show increase overall survival patient group 3 month . Radiation therapy treatment alternative , however , high local dos require long-term local control . However , due relatively low radiation tolerance liver normal tissue , even use stereotactic technique , delivery sufficient dose successful local tumor control achieve date . Carbon ion offer physical biological characteristic . Due invert dose profile high local dose deposition within Bragg peak precise dose application spar normal tissue possible . Moreover , comparison photon , carbon ion offer increased relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) , calculate 2 3 depend HCC cell line well endpoint analyze . Japanese Data evaluation carbon ion radiation therapy show promising result patient HCC . In current Phase I-PROMETHEUS-01-Study , carbon ion radiotherapy evaluate patient advanced HCC . The study perform dose-escalation study evaluate optimal carbon ion dose respect toxicity tumor control . Primary endpoint toxicity , secondary endpoint progression-free survival response .</brief_summary>
