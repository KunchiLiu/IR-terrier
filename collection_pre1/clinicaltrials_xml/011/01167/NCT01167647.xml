	<brief_title>The Role Routine Bacterial Culture Including Tuberculosis During Bronchoscopy : A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many center routinely culture bronchoscopy sample bacteria mycobacteria even infection include tuberculosis ( TB ) strongly suspect . However , value practice poorly define . Unnecessary bronchial culture bacteria may lead treatment patient without clinical evidence infection may increase drug resistant strain . In area high prevalence TB , routine bronchial culture may detect clinically unsuspected TB appreciable proportion case . However , population low prevalence TB , routine culture bronchial aspirate may incur unnecessary expanse may lead diagnosis treatment patient non pathogenic atypical mycobacteria detect acid-fast bacillus strain .</detailed_description>
