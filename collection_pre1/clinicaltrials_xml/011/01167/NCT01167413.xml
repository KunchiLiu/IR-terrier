	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FMS ) non - inflammatory condition characterize presence chronic , widespread musculoskeletal pain tenderness ; FMS consider result increase processing pain central nervous system . Axial spondyloarthropathy hallmark Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) , inflammatory joint disease involve axial spine , sacroiliac joint well peripheral joint . Although FMS AS differ vastly pathogenesis , considerable clinical overlap may exist condition . Both disorder typically cause chronic nocturnal back pain disturbed sleep may accompany either condition . In addition , investigator previously describe increase prevalence ( secondary ) FMS among female AS patient . This overlap may important clinical implication since presence comorbid FMS may lead increased severity result commonly use instrument evaluation disease activity AS , BASDAI BASFI . Recently , Assessment Spondyloarthritis international Society ( ASAS ) publish updated classification criterion axial spondyloarthropathy . These criterion , summarize table 1 , base evaluation patient suffer chronic back pain age onset less 45 . Objective : The objective current study evaluate prevalence axial spondyloarthropathies among FMS patient , utilize new ASAS criterion .</brief_summary>
