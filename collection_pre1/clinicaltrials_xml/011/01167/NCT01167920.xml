	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize control trial design determine whether blue tooth telephone technology utilize successfully relay home blood pressure information electronically healthcare provider timely frequent treatment intervention institute optimize reach goal blood pressure level individual compare usual care . The primary study outcome improvement systolic , diastolic , blood pressure control time control blood pressure . Secondary outcome proportion patient control blood pressure goal end study , adherence blood pressure monitor utilization VHC model . If successful cost-effective technology intervention could utilize large scale improve care proportion hypertensive patient achieve goal blood pressure United States .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypertension major risk factor renal cardiovascular disease , significant contributor adult disability . About 50 million individual hypertensive United States1 . The Framingham Heart Study suggest normotensive individual 55 year 90 % lifetime risk hypertension2 . Treatment hypertension lead reason physician visit prescription drug US3 . Despite increase awareness risk complication poorly control hypertension , 58 % hypertensive patient treat 38 % achieve blood pressure control4 , 5 . Sub-optimal therapy remain common cause uncontrolled hypertension6 . One major barrier effective management hypertension therapeutic inertia part physicians lead suboptimal therapy prescribe hypertensive patients7 . This barrier effective hypertension treatment achieve significance data several clinical trial clearly demonstrate reduction blood pressure even millimeter mercury significantly decrease individual risk mortality cardiovascular disease8 . Although hypertension remain common reason patient visit physician office United States , lack patient-health care provider connectivity outside office setting may play important factor disappointing proportion patient achieve blood pressure control US past 30 year . Recent home blood pressure monitor guideline publish American Heart Association professional society emphasize importance home blood pressure monitor management hypertension9 . In addition , recent study Green et al extend concept step utilize web base intervention utilized pharmacist control blood pressure10 . Results study demonstrate significant reduction blood pressure intervention group compare usual care ( -14.2 mmHg Vs -5.3 mmHg p &lt; 0.001 ) . One potential draw back web base intervention blood pressure control could lack access internet general population . According recent USDA report , almost 40 % Americans urban area 60 % rural area internet access ( http : //arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/03/the-many-blessing-of-rural.ars ) . This essence would deprive large number hypertension access web base new model blood pressure control test recent study Green et al . The Stabil-o-Graph validate home blood pressure device ( http : //www.dableducational.org/dabl_library/library2_sbpm.html # upper_arm ) relay blood pressure reading designate health care provider use blue tooth technology telephone connection The current model health care US management hypertension employ direct patient-physician encounter office set control blood pressure . This exist healthcare model fail keep abreast current national guideline consensus among expert hypertension promote home blood pressure monitor application new technology potential seamlessly connect patient health care provider goal improve blood pressure control . Our propose study aim address gap patient-healthcare provider connectivity utilize new technology home blood pressure monitor achieve goal blood pressure foe individual .</detailed_description>
