	<detailed_description>Principal Hypotheses : An intervention program design provide developmentally appropriate guidance parent infant responsive parent healthy lifestyle prevent rapid weight gain infancy overweight age 3 year . Further , compare control infant , intervention infant low BMI percentile age 3 . We also hypothesize control infant gain weight rapidly time , adjust trait-stable time-varying covariates ( e.g. , maternal pre-pregnancy BMI , percent feeding breast milk vs. formula , sleep duration , feed frequency ) . The Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing Healthy Trajectories ( INSIGHT ) Study , test hypothesis two arm randomize trial participant program prevent childhood obesity compare child safety control program . Nurses deliver intervention first-time parent infant study group four home visit first year birth follow annual clinical research center visit age 3 . Blood sample genetic test appetite , growth , temperament collect mother , child , father . The obesity prevention program focus message responsive parent healthy lifestyle , extend infancy age 3 year . The intervention teach first-time parent interact infant way prompt , emotionally supportive , contingent , developmentally appropriate . This information especially important first year birth infant make dramatic dietary transition initial exclusive milk diet one many food adult diet culture . During transition , food introduce child , numerous opportunity address dietary content well parent feed style . In addition message , intervention parent give education growth chart , mean growth chart percentile , healthy growth pattern early life . The intervention program hypothesize show efficacy breast formula feed infant measure primary outcome , body mass index ( BMI ) percentile age 3 year . Additionally , participant follow collect anthropometric measurement 4,5,6,10,14 , 17 year age provide significant insight long-term obesity risk . The propose research add two major piece enrol second born sibling collect genetic specimen sibling parent . Specifically , translational research ) prospectively evaluate obesity-related parenting similarity difference well weight-related outcome first second-born sibling , b ) explore genetic difference among sibling associate appetite , temperament , obesity susceptibility affect parent-child interaction , degree responsive parenting , weight status , c ) determine whether INSIGHT study intervention carryover effect occur among family participate observation-only second-born child evaluation .</detailed_description>
