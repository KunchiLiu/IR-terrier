	<brief_summary>This phase III clinical trial study two different dose schedule paclitaxel see well work combination carboplatin without bevacizumab treat patient stage II , III IV ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Bevacizumab type drug call monoclonal antibody block tumor growth stop growth blood vessel tumor need grow . It yet know whether give paclitaxel combination chemotherapy every three week effective give paclitaxel week treat patient ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Carboplatin With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine weekly paclitaxel regimen increase time first progression death ( progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) compare every-3-week paclitaxel regimen woman primary stage II , III IV epithelial ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer receive carboplatin without bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine weekly paclitaxel increase duration overall survival compare every-3-week paclitaxel combine carboplatin without bevacizumab . II . To compare weekly paclitaxel every-3-week paclitaxel respect incidence severe serious adverse event combine carboplatin without bevacizumab . III . To compare weekly paclitaxel every-3-week paclitaxel respect patient ' self-reported quality life ( QOL ) measure Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Ovarian ( FACT-O ) -Trial Outcome Index ( TOI ) , paclitaxel combine carboplatin without bevacizumab . ( As 02/08/2012 , QOL portion study complete ; patient enrol date QOL assessment ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) associate progression-free survival toxicity advance stage epithelial ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer use genome wide association study ( GWAS ) . * II . To evaluate genomic signature tumor tissue predictive patient survival advance stage epithelial ovarian , peritoneal fallopian tube cancer . * III . To evaluate association serum plasma biomarkers response anti-angiogenesis therapy advance stage epithelial ovarian , peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer . * NOTE : *As 02/08/2012 , translational research ( TR ) portion study complete ; patient enrol date TR specimens collect . IMAGING PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether large change tumor perfusion parameter baseline timepoint ( T0 ) early-therapy T2 prognostic high progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 6 month ( PFS-6 ) enrollment patient treat weekly every-3-week paclitaxel regimen , receive carboplatin without bevacizumab . *** IMAGING SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether large change tumor perfusion parameter baseline T0 intermediate T1 T1 T2 prognostic high PFS-6 patient treated weekly every-3-week paclitaxel regimen , receive carboplatin without bevacizumab . *** II . To determine whether large change tumor perfusion parameter value T0 T1 , T0 T2 , T1 T2 prognostic good overall survival treatment arm . *** III . To assess association change tumor perfusion parameter chemotherapy initiation ( T0 T1 ) subsequent best tumor response accord standard anatomic Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . *** IV . To assess association tumor perfusion parameter chemotherapy subsequent best tumor response accord RECIST , PFS-6 , overall survival . *** V. To test assumption tumor perfusion parameter reliable , user-independent , reproducible parameter tumor microvascular characteristic ; subgroup 15 patient repeat compute tomography ( CT ) perfusion study intermediate T1 time point . *** NOTE : ***Patients enrol February 8 , 2012 must participate ACRIN 6695 component ACRIN-qualified institution . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm ( begin 04-30-2012 , trial longer randomize chemotherapy regimen select declare prior enrol study ) . ARM I ( adjuvant chemotherapy suboptimally debulked ) : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . ARM II ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy interval cytoreductive surgery ) : Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients undergo interval cytoreductive surgery course 3 4 . Patients arm may receive optional** bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 begin course 2 . Courses bevacizumab repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients Arm II receive bevacizumab course 2 , 5 , 6 . NOTE : **Before enrol onto study , patient choose whether study treatment include concurrent maintenance bevacizumab . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
