	<brief_summary>For patient leukemia respond progressed initial response standard therapy , therapeutic option limit . Although response standard regimen occur , durable remission achieve infrequently current regimen curative majority patient . Identification active agent patient relapse Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) ultimately affords potential use upfront component induction regimen may translate improved outcome . Therefore , development new agent critical importance . This study look new , investigational agent , ON 01910.Na , determine potential help Patients AML Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( ALL ) transform Myeloproliferative Neoplasms .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single center , open-label , phase 1/2 study 2 34 patient refractory acute myeloid lymphocytic leukemia transform myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPNs ) meet inclusion/exclusion criterion administer daily dose 2400 mg ON 01910.Na dose intravenous continuous infusion ( IVCI ) 24 hour 72 120 consecutive hour every 2 week first 4 week receive oral rigosertib 560 mg twice-daily dose capsule take continuously . In phase 1 component trial , standard dose escalation scheme follow enrolment least three patient treat daily dose 2400 mg ON 01910.Na IVCI 24 hour 72 hour . The dose escalation scheme follow traditional dose escalation rule , also know `` 3+3 '' rule : If none initial three patient treat 72-hour cohort experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , first two 2-week cycle , new cohort three patient treated 2400 mg/24h daily dose increase 120 hour duration . DLT define adverse event possibly relate ON 01910.Na : - Grade ≥ 3 non-hematological toxicity nausea , vomit , diarrhea , fever , esophagitis/dysphagia - Grade ≥ 3 nausea vomit uncontrolled antiemetic ; grade ≥ 3 diarrhea uncontrolled antidiarrheal agent ; grade ≥ 3 drug-induced fever uncontrolled antipyretic ; grade ≥3 metabolic abnormality control optimal supportive care measure - Grade ≥ 3 stomatitis and/or esophagitis/dysphagia last &gt; 3 day - Marrow cellularity &lt; 5 % day 42 later ( 6 week ) start therapy without evidence leukemia If one three patient 72-hour cohort experience DLT first two cycle , three additional patient treat 72 hour duration . Escalation 120-hour cohort proceed one six patient treat 72-hour cohort experience DLT . If two patient 72-hour cohort experience DLT first two cycle , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) exceed , dose extension occur , full safety review determine enrollment patient proceed . If none initial three patient 120-hour cohort experience DLT first two cycle , regimen confirm Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) dose escalation occur . If one three patient 120-hour cohort experience DLT first two cycle , three additional patient treat duration . If one patient experience DLT , 120-hour regimen confirm Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) dose escalation occur . If two patient 120 hour cohort experience DLT first two cycle , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine 2400 mg/24h administer 72 hour every week . Once phase 1 portion study complete , accrual phase 2 portion begin . Patients treat MTD phase 1 portion include phase 2 component evaluate response secondary end point . The total study duration 30 week , include 2-week screening phase , 24-week dosing phase ( 4-week rigosertib CIV administration , follow 20 week oral rigosertib administration ) , 4-week follow-up phase begin last dose rigosertib . Beginning week 5 , patient assess response every time complete blood count ( CBC ) perform follow . Patients achieve week 24 response stabilization disease eligible receive additional 24 week rigosertib dose follow .</detailed_description>
