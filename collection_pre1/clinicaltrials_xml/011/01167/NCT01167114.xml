	<brief_summary>In research study , investigator look see effective STA-9090 treat esophagogastric cancer . The investigator also evaluate side effect STA-9090 , examine relationship presence HSP-90 well study participant respond STA-9090 . STA-9090 work block protein tumor cell call HSP90 , think play role tumor growth . By interfere protein 's function , STA-9090 may help kill tumor cell . This drug use research study information research study suggest agent may help slow tumor growth esophagogastric cancer .</brief_summary>
