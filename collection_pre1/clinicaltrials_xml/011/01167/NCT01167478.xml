	<brief_title>Neurophysiological Reserve With Caffeine Manipulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A neurophysiological reserve related central mechanism suppose present , observe increased central drive occurs . In theory , accord central regulation model effort , increase performance could due elevation Central Nervous System excitability activity , since exercise peripherally limit . Conversely , absence muscle performance improvement increase central drive promote caffeine would evidence peripherally localized neurophysiological limit would indicate absence reserve . Therefore , present , reserve could verify use peripheral central measure derive electric-stimulation , evoke twitch interpolate twitch technique , associate measure EMG peripheral metabolism , caffeine manipulate closed- opened-loop exercise . In addition , also possible access reserve without stimulant substance manipulation ( placebo effect ) . By teleological argument derive central regulation model effort , neurophysiological reserve would natural mechanism protect cellular integrity . Therefore , would reasonable hypothesize , present , reserve would observe increase performance promote elevation central drive placebo perceive caffeine . Unfortunately , however , study utilized experimental approach , include measure central peripheral activity closed- opened-loop exercise , consistently respond reserve question .</detailed_description>
