	<brief_summary>The aim study determine different ingredient find food consumer product affect ability saliva form surface film . Saliva form protective film surface inside mouth . This film affect way consume digest food protects teeth surface inside mouth disease decay . It well know film form , component everyday life affect formation film , therefore protective property . Samples saliva collect apparently healthy volunteer . The property film ( thickness , density , strength , protein composition ) study laboratory control condition . The effect common ingredient food product protein , emulsifier , preservatives surfactant formation property film determine . The result study help u understand different ingredient change property saliva may affect way sense digest food , ability saliva protect decay infection . This could , future lead new idea develop : healthy food ( e.g . low fat ) taste well , effective dental care product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study determine physical biochemical mechanism responsible formation structure development ( vitro ) salivary mucous film impact common ingredient find food oral hygiene product . Saliva form film pellicle oral surface serve protective barrier lubricate oral tissue food consumption . However , also provide primary site bacterial attachment build plaque . Therefore physical molecular structure salivary film important sense taste food , food broken mouth , effectiveness protective barrier . Much know composition saliva , little known composition structure salivary film pellicle . We believe film formation physical property , viscosity strength result complex interaction different protein within saliva , component calcium salt , food component proteins emulsifier , active compound find oral hygiene product preservatives surfactant . This study determine salivary film form , molecular composition critical component affect ability form stable , protective barrier . This knowledge hopefully , future contribute strategy design healthy food effective oral hygiene treatment . The physical property saliva stable protein tend aggregate follow secretion , affect length time film formation study ( ex vivo ) . Therefore need use fresh human saliva sample collect healthy volunteer use define protocol ensure sample quality , ass within four hour collection . Saliva collect ( either whole mouth parotid ) , take laboratory allow form film model surface , representative find mouth . The rate formation , strength , thickness mass film study use range physical method . The protein content composition also determine identify component responsible various stage film formation . Then , influence environmental condition pH , calcium salt determine . Finally , determine film interact external component find food oral hygiene product proteins , emulsifier , preservatives surfactant . Although study effect dietary intervention saliva property , want determine underlie mechanism responsible film formation break . Paired T-tests use compare parotid whole mouth saliva volunteer . Two sample T-tests use comparison similar measurement sample different volunteer . Diagnostic check result perform check whether transformation require meet normality assumption . Two type saliva sample collect : Whole Mouth Saliva ( WMS ) Parotid Saliva ( PS ) . The saliva store 4ºC ( WMS may also centrifuge 2700xg 20 minute 5°C remove aggregate ) use within 4 hour collection , protein aggregation begin immediately secretion , affect film formation property , determine previous work . A range physical technique employ determine rate extent film formation , well thickness , mass rheological property , different solution condition presence absence add ingredient describe . Protein concentration composition also determine . This enable improved experimental design ( e.g . normalise protein concentration ) improve quality result . The result use inform design study centre expertise order understand impact vivo behaviour salivary film , example sensory perception food role saliva digestion food structure .</detailed_description>
