	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient consistently underfed . Feeding protocol standardized system tool use guide nutrition practice , date fail improve delivery nutrition . The PEP uP Protocol new enhance feeding protocol . Twenty North American Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) ass baseline nutrition practice . Ten ICUs randomize implement PEP uP Protocol educational intervention , ten randomize continue usual care . Nutrition practice reevaluate 6 month baseline . The investigator hypothesize PEP uP Protocol increase delivery nutrition , may ultimately lead improved survival critical illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Protein-Energy Provision Via Enteral Route Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There well know well describe relationship malnutrition , immune dysfunction , infection . Critically ill patient often hypermetabolic rapidly become nutritionally compromised . Repeated effort past year significantly improve amount calorie deliver via enteral route . Historically , feed protocol use guide delivery enteral nutrition ( EN ) frequently utilize conservative , reactionary approach optimize nutrition . We propose new , innovative approach protocolizes aggressive set strategy provide EN shift paradigm reactionary proactive follow de-escalation nutrition therapy need . The key component new protocol following : 1 ) Starting feed target rate base increase evidence patient tolerate start nutrition high rate delivery slow start ups necessary . For patient hemodynamically stable , propose shift hourly rate target goal 24 hour volume goal give nurse guidance make volume interruption non-gastrointestinal reason . This 'volume-based ' goal represent significant shift practice traditional fix hourly rate goal new protocol nurse increase hourly rate depend many hour leave day ensure patient receives 24 hour volume within day . 2 ) For patient deem unsuitable high volume intragastric feed , provide option initiate 'trophic feed . ' Trophic feed represent idea provide low volume concentrate feeding solution 24 hour longer , design maintain gastrointestinal structure function rather meet protein caloric goal . This option reduce number patient order kept nil per o ( NPO ) . Thus , PEP uP patient may gain benefit early EN . 3 ) To optimize tolerance early phase critical illness , propose use semi elemental feed solution instead standard polymeric solution . There evidence semi elemental solution well assimilate polymeric solution critical care set . These solution change traditional polymeric solution patient tolerate adequate amount nutrition . 4 ) Rather wait protein debt accumulate inadequate delivery EN , protein supplement prescribe initiation EN discontinue EN well tolerate receive protein requirement standard EN . This strategy guarantee patient likely receive protein requirement early phase critical illness . 5 ) Rather wait problem gastrointestinal tolerance develop , propose start motility agent time EN start re-evaluation day follow see necessary . By prevent delay gastric emptying , frequently occur patient population , improve nutritional adequacy . 6 ) Based emerge evidence high gastric residual volume ( volume feed remain stomach bedside nurse aspirate feed tube ) safe perhaps result great nutritional adequacy , include high gastric residual volume 300ml protocol . It show one randomize trial feed protocol start motility agent empirically time initiation feed use high threshold critical gastric residual volume ( 250 ml ) improve nutritional adequacy . Since bedside nurse initiate utilize feeding protocol achieve target goal , couple new generational feeding protocol comprehensive nurse-directed nutritional educational intervention focus safe effective implementation . This focus nursing nutrition education represent major shift away traditional education focus dietitian physician . Our hypothesis aggressive feeding protocol combine nurse-directed nutrition educational intervention safe , acceptable , effectively increase protein energy delivery critically ill patient . We postulate increase provision calorie protein may translate improved clinical outcome , particularly patient extremes weight , current study power demonstrate difference .</detailed_description>
