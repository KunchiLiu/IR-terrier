	<brief_title>A Study Therapy Selected Molecular/Metabolic Profiling Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following first-line therapy gemcitabine base regimen , significant number patient maintain adequate performance status able tolerate second-line therapy . A recent phase III trial randomize patient either 5-flurouracil ( 5FU ) , folinic acid addition weekly oxaliplatin regimen 5FU/folinic acid . The interim result show statistically significant survival advantage oxaliplatin contain arm ( 26 versus 13 week , P= 0.014 ) . However outcome patient progress first-line gemcitabine regimen still poor median survival 2-6 month . Almost patient advance APC , treat gemcitabine alone gemcitabine base combination therapy exhibit resistance therapy . In patient treated gemcitabine alone , time progression ( TTP ) 3-4 month . Thus patient exhibit progression /or toxicity require second line therapy 4-6 month first line therapy . The best one year survival report phase II trial 24 % . However standard second line therapy APC , rapid progression tumor see set , new strategy base rational target identification need . In study propose select therapy base molecular profiling patient tumor .</detailed_description>
