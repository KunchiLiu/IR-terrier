	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness daptomycin , antibiotic compare another one vancomycin give around time joint replacement surgery . Vancomycin recommend perioperative prophylaxis methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) colonize patient undergo primary total joint arthroplasty . Daptomycin recommend indication FDA approve treatment MRSA blood stream skin soft tissue infection . Data collect study may support use daptomycin indication may also use research purpose yet specify .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daptomycin Use Antimicrobial Prophylaxis Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) Colonized Adult Patients Undergoing Primary Elective Hip , Knee , Shoulder Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 4 randomize open label prospective pilot study compare use daptomycin versus vancomycin peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis patient undergo elective primary knee , hip shoulder arthroplasty risk infection methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus . The study population include male non-pregnant , non-lactating female 18 year age old , history methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection colonization , undergo primary elective hip , knee shoulder arthroplasty . The target enrollment 100 patient , randomize daptomycin vancomycin two 50 patient study group . After sign informed consent , patient undergo pre-enrollment nasal screen methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus identify eligible patient . Patients positive MRSA nasal screen proceed enrollment get randomize one two study group . In one group , patient receive one dose daptomycin 6 mg/kg infuse 30 minute . In group , infusion start complete within 60 minute surgical incision . In second group , patient receive one dose vancomycin 15 mg/kg infuse 1-2 hour surgical incision accord dose avoid red man syndrome . In group , infusion start complete within 120 minute surgical incision . After surgery , second similar dose vancomycin give 12 hour first dose patient creatinine clearance ( CLcr . ) ≥50 ml/min . All patient group ask shower chlorhexidine skin cleanser ( HIBICLENS® ) daily neck 7days surgery apply Mupirocin ointment 2 % nostrils twice daily 5 day surgery . The patient evaluate day surgery , 2-3 day postoperatively , discharge , one month three month follow visit . During study evaluation , patient assess clinically sign symptom wound , prosthetic joint infection ( include pain , tenderness , swell , erythema , poor wound heal wound drainage ) prior hospital discharge , one , three month follow visit . Blood work include complete blood count , erythrocytic sedimentation rate , c-reactive protein , culture order clinical finding suggest infection . Bacterial isolates cause infection test locally antibiotic susceptibility include daptomycin vancomycin save test need . Adverse effect tolerability document use drug two patient group . Data collect analyzed appropriate testing . The primary endpoint success prevention postoperative SSI prosthetic joint infection one month postoperative follow visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed , date informed consent define Institutional Review Board . Male female patient older 18 year age undergoing primary elective hip , knee shoulder arthroplasty . Documented nasal carriage MRSA . If female childbearing potential patient agree practice reliable contraceptive method ( e.g . birth control pill , condom , intrauterine device [ IUD ] ) treatment one month receive study medication . Concurrent urinary tract infection colonization unless treat evidence microbiologic cure . Evidence active infection elsewhere urinary tract , unless treat evidence microbiologic cure document infectious disease service . Patients undergo elective secondary arthroplasty . Concurrent open wound Pregnant nursing woman ( patient still childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test confirm ) . History allergy contraindication study drug . Weight &gt; 150 kg &lt; 50kg Patients creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) &lt; 30ml/min ( calculate use CockcroftGault equation use ideal body weight ) Severe neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.500x103 /µl ) . Patients consider unlikely comply study procedure return schedule post treatment evaluation . Ongoing antibiotic therapy active infection anticipate continue day surgery . Any condition opinion investigator , would confound interfere evaluation safety efficacy investigational medication , prevent compliance study protocol .</criteria>
