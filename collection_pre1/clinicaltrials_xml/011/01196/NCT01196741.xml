	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether addition Src inhibitor saracatinib ( AZD0530 ) weekly paclitaxel improves efficacy , compare paclitaxel plus placebo , patient relapse platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . The trial also determine toxicity ascertain whether combination paclitaxel plus saracatinib proceed phase III trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Saracatinib Paclitaxel Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A multicentre , randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase II trial conduct . The overall aim trial investigate whether addition saracatinib weekly paclitaxel improve efficacy , measure progression free survival , compare paclitaxel plus placebo . The trial also determine toxicity ascertain whether combination paclitaxel plus saracatinib proceed phase III trial . The toxicity data Study NCT00610714 ( D8180C00015 ) suggest small number patient could experience febrile neutropaenia first chemotherapy cycle . To combat , saracatinib ( 175 mg OD ) /matched placebo begin 1 week prior commencement chemotherapy , give continuously progression . All patient receive cycle weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy . One cycle consist weekly paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2 ) 6 week follow 2 week rest . If evidence on-going response 4 cycle , 3 cycle saracatinib/placebo plus weekly paclitaxel give , unless dose-limiting toxicity patient request discontinue treatment . If best response stable disease 4 cycle , treatment discontinue may continue discretion Investigator .</detailed_description>
