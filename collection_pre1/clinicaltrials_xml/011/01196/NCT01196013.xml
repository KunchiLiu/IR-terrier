	<brief_title>A Study Clofarabine Japanese Paediatric Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I Study Clofarabine Japanese Paediatric Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia . Subjects receive intravenous administration clofarabine 30 52 mg/m2/day ( 2 hour ) 5 consecutive day administration withhold Day 14 . If evidence recovery neutrophil ( ≥750/mm3 ) and/or platelet count ( ≥50,000/mm3 ) , therapy may withhold Day 42 . However , absence progression base judgment investigator cycle treatment benefit continue treatment judge exceed risk , subject may receive total six cycle . If subject receive two cycle , write consent must obtain prior start Cycle 2 . When subject complete final dose , safety observe followed-up 45 day final study drug administration . Cohort 1 receive 30 mg/m2/day x 5 day Cycle 1 assess tolerability . Samples draw assess pharmacokinetics dose . If subject develop adverse event indicative dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) Cycle 1 , dose increase 52 mg/m2/day x 5 day Cycle 2 subject assessed safety activity . Cohort 2 receive 52 mg/m2/day x 5 day Cycle 1 assess tolerability . Samples draw assess pharmacokinetics dose . Whether proceed Cohort 2 Cycle 1 Cohort 1 complete determine sponsor base assessment safety data recommendation Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) .</detailed_description>
