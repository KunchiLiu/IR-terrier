	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) frequent airway disease characterize bronchial inflammation remodelling . Bronchial mucosa infiltrate macrophage , neutrophil lymphocyte . In addition , number eosinophil also increase exacerbation . Airway remodelling abnormal tissue repair follow bronchial inflammation , contribute none reversible pathological feature , bronchial peri-bronchial fibrosis . It also influence prognosis COPD mechanism remain largely unknown . The role fibrocytes demonstrated pathophysiology asthma , lung fibrosis pulmonary hypertension . However , recruitment blood fibrocytes involvement COPD airway remodelling remain unknown .</brief_summary>
