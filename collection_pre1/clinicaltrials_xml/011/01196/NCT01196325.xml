	<brief_summary>The study investigate change structure function blood vessel front back eye follow laser anti-VEGF treatment sight-threatening diabetic eye disease . Sixty four volunteer recruit , include age-matched control subject diabetic patient require conventional contemporary treatment pre-existing diabetic eye disease . Volunteers assess treatment use state-of-the-art technique measure vision , rate blood flow structure front back eye effectiveness blood flow delivery . Changes follow treatment novel , non-invasive technique quantify described . We anticipate conventional new / develop treatment lead narrow vessel consequent reduction blood flow back front eye . There strong relationship structural change eye functional change blood vessel front back eye . The result study improve understanding impact various treatment entire eye . The research also ensure improve understanding mechanism action various treatment provide insight reason good poor outcome , base upon specific change structure blood flow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anterior Posterior Segment Vascular Changes Following Laser Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic Retinopathy ( DR ) single lead cause blindness people work age . The total number people live diabetes Canada well 2 million . The WHO estimate around 12 % people diabetes blind develop severe vision loss . The two common treatment DR : Laser Photocoagulation anti-VEGF intravitreal injection . Clinical evidence demonstrate treatment lead morphological vascular retinal change , however actual mechanism nature post treatment change fully understood . It recently objective quantitative image hemodynamic technology previously unachievable resolution become available enable u evaluate compare various effect treatment vital eye structure . We propose take advantage state-of-the-art technology order explore unknown effect treatment vital eye structure . We hypothesize : 1 ) Laser Photocoagulation anti-VEGF treatment result vessel constriction hence reduction posterior ( retinal choroidal ) anterior ( conjunctival ) ocular blood flow ; 2 ) Changes anterior segment ocular morphology blood flow positively correlate change posterior segment morphology blood flow ; 3 ) Combined treatment result great reduction posterior anterior blood flow single treatment ; 4 ) There differences anterior posterior blood flow outcomes anterior segment oxygen saturation compare healthy control . The study include four group participant : Laser treatment group ; Intravitreal injection Bevacizumab treatment group ; Intravitreal injection Ranibizumab treatment group ; Healthy age match control . The administration ranibizumab bevacizumab randomize across participant . Randomization number assign participant record Master Randomization Assignment List . All patient recruit Retina Clinics Toronto Western Hospital . Every type 2 diabetic patient Diabetic Macular Edema assess prior treatment followed-up 3rd , 7th,30th day 3 month initial treatment .</detailed_description>
