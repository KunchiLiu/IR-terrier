	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well radiation therapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin without trastuzumab work treat patient esophageal cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether give radiation therapy combination chemotherapy together without trastuzumab effective treat esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy , Paclitaxel , Carboplatin With Without Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To determine trastuzumab increase disease-free survival combine trimodality treatment ( radiation plus chemotherapy follow surgery ) patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate addition trastuzumab trimodality treatment increase pathologic complete response rate overall survival patient HER2-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma . II . To develop tissue bank tumor tissue patient non-metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma . III . To determine molecular correlate complete pathologic response , disease-free survival , overall survival patient HER2-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma treat neoadjuvant maintenance trastuzumab . IV . To evaluate predictor cardiotoxicity patient esophageal cancer treat trastuzumab chemoradiation . V. To evaluate adverse event associate addition trastuzumab trimodality treatment patient non-metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition trastuzumab trimodality treatment improve patient-reported Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy Esophageal Cancer ( FACT-E ) Esophageal Cancer Subscale ( ECS ) score . II . To determine improvement FACT-E ECS score 6-8 week post completion neoadjuvant chemoradiation correlate pathologic complete response . III . To determine pathologic complete response correlate FACT-E ECS score 1 year and/or 2 year start chemoradiation . IV . To determine addition trastuzumab trimodality treatment improve Swallow Index Eating Index Subscale score FACT-E. V. To determine addition trastuzumab paclitaxel , carboplatin , radiation impact quality-adjusted survival . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5.5 week . Patients also receive trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 57 paclitaxel IV 60 minute carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Beginning 21-56 day surgery , patient receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute . Treatment repeat every 21 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 5.5 week . Patients also receive paclitaxel IV 60 minute carboplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Within 5-8 week completion radiotherapy , patient undergo surgery . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 4 month 2 year yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
