	<brief_title>Low-Dose Tamoxifen Citrate Reducing Breast Cancer Risk Radiation-Induced Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine impact two-year course low-dose tamoxifen ( tamoxifen citrate ) administer 5 mg per day surrogate endpoint biomarkers breast cancer ( BC ) risk , include : mammographic breast density ( MBD ) , establish radiographic biomarker BC risk ; cytomorphology proliferative index , tissue biomarkers closely link BC risk ; sex steroid hormone insulin growth factor , circulate biomarkers BC risk . II . To establish safety tolerability low-dose tamoxifen regimen , assess objective measure ( lipid profile , clot factor bone metabolism marker ) patient-reported outcome . III . To examine modify effect demographic , clinical , molecular characteristic risk : benefit ratio two-year low dose tamoxifen intervention . IV . To explore relationship low-dose tamoxifen regimen clinical measure efficacy ( new breast cancer ductal carcinoma situ [ DCIS ] diagnose ) toxicity ( thromboembolic event , report hot flash gynecological symptom , liver function abnormality , cancer diagnosis ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive tamoxifen citrate orally ( PO ) daily 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO daily 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
