	<detailed_description>The effectiveness drug use treat colorectal cancer may different person person . Researchers want learn certain biomarkers use help predict cancer drug may work good drug different people colorectal cancer . Study Participation : If agree take part study , follow test procedure perform : - A leftover sample tumor tissue previous procedure , available , used biomarker test . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing , check level cytokine ( protein may affect immune system ) , check circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) blood . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . You also fill questionnaire cancer symptom . This take 5 minute . Biomarker Test Results : The study doctor staff review biomarker test result . If result seem show certain investigational drug may help control cancer , drug available separate MD Anderson clinical research study call `` companion '' drug study , doctor may recommend additional test procedure perform . The test procedure perform part companion drug study see eligible receive drug . You ask sign separate consent form companion drug study . It possible biomarker test result may seem show one drug may help control cancer . If , may possible could receive drug ( ) companion study future . The study test describe would repeat study well . Even biomarker test show certain drug may helpful , possible may eligible take part separate companion drug study , study drug may available , may reason take part drug study . You may also decide want take part companion drug study . Your doctor discus available treatment option . Study Visits : At study visit biomarker research study , follow test procedure perform : - You fill cancer symptom questionnaire . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker , cytokine , CTC test . Your schedule study visit depend whether take part companion study . There different schedule visit participant take part companion study instead either take part clinical research study companion study receive standard cancer drug ( ) . If take part 1 companion study , study visit biomarker research study follow schedule : - start take drug ( ) join companion drug study 2 week since test do ( note : amount blood drawn 2 tablespoon visit ) - time return image scans time take part 1 companion drug study - stop take part companion drug study If first treatment consent biomarker research study part clinical research study companion study receive standard cancer drug ( ) , study visit biomarker research study follow schedule : - start take drug ( ) first treatment period MD Anderson 2 week since test do ( note : amount blood drawn 2 tablespoon visit ) - time return image scan first treatment period MD Anderson - first stop take part clinical research study companion drug study , first stop take standard cancer drug ( ) . Length Treatment : The study test continue : long take part companion drug study , first stop take part clinical research study companion drug study , first stop take standard cancer drug ( ) , take part companion drug study . Follow-Up Visit : If stop take part study : - You fill cancer symptom questionnaire . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn biomarker , cytokine , CTC test . Long-Term Follow-Up : After follow-up visit , , research staff collect information health status , drug ( ) receive , status disease . This information may collect time standard clinic visit , review medical record imaging scan , and/or contact phone , mail , and/or email . If call , call last 10 minute less . This investigational study . This study 's biomarker test research purpose . Up 1280 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
