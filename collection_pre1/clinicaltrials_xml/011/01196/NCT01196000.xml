	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery may less invasive type surgery rectal cancer may fewer side effect improve recovery . It yet know whether robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery effective laparoscopic surgery treat patient rectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery see well work compare laparoscopic surgery treat patient rectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Laparoscopic Surgery Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery Treating Patients With Rectal Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery versus standard laparoscopic rectal cancer resection mean randomize , control trial . II . To assess technical ease operation , determine clinical indicator low conversion rate open operation . III . To assess surgical accuracy improve oncological outcome determine clear pathological resection margin . IV . To assess quality life analyze cost-effectiveness aid evidence-based knowledge inform NHS service provider decision-makers . V. To analyze disease-free overall survival local recurrence rate 3-year follow-up . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo standard laparoscopic resection . ARM II : Patients undergo robotic-assisted laparoscopic resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , 6 month , annually thereafter 3 year .</detailed_description>
