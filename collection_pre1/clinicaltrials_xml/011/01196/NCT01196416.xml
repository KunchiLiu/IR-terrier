	<brief_summary>This phase Ib/II trial study side effect best dose gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 give together cisplatin , vinblastine , temozolomide see well work treat patient recurrent metastatic melanoma . Gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , vinblastine , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gamma-secretase/Notch Signalling Pathway Inhibitor RO4929097 Combination With Cisplatin , Vinblastine , Temozolomide Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability daily RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) administer orally daily combination CVT ( start dose : cisplatin 25 mg/m^2 intravenous [ IV ] daily x 3 ; vinblastine 1.2 mg/m^2 IV daily x 3 , temozolomide [ TMZ ] 150 mg/m^2 orally [ PO ] daily x 5 ) administer every 21 day schedule . ( Phase Ib ) II . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) RO4929097 CVT patient metastatic melanoma correlative biomarkers Notch pathway signal gamma secretase enzyme activity . ( Phase Ib ) III . Based MTD phase Ib study , conduct phase II trial determine response rate overall survival . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics combination RO4929097 temozolomide . ( Phase Ib ) II . To obtain tissue biopsy correlative study initiation therapy one week treatment RO4929097 CVT . ( Phase Ib II ) III . To determine progression-free survival patient treat phase II dose . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I dose-escalation study gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 , follow phase II study . Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , cisplatin IV 30 minute vinblastine IV 30 minute day 1-3 , temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without progressive disease continue receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 temozolomide absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 24 month .</detailed_description>
