	<brief_title>Follow-up Adult Height Cohort Subjects Born Small Gestational Age Treated With Growth Hormone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The small gestational age ( SGA ) concept include baby born term whose weight and/or height low two standard deviation ( SD ) mean . Pathologically short stature understood stature 2.5 SD mean age expect adult height adjust parental height one SD mean . These SGA child pathological short stature four year age unsuitable GH treatment . In fact , efficient treatment short stature insufficient development child GH . In addition short stature , SGA syndrome also include resistance insulin consequent risk develop type 2 diabetes interrelate metabolic alteration like dyslipidemia hypertension ; glucose-insulin-insulin growth factor ( IGFs ) -proteins transport axis regulate growth well foetal metabolism development . Independent possible maternal environmental cause , bear SGA low level somatomedin C ( IGF-I ) transport protein [ Insulin-like growth factor bind protein 3 ( IGFBP-3 ) ] well fast hyperinsulinemia . The low level IGF-1 IGFBP-3 persist present catch-up growth insulin resistance secondary somatotrope axis . Treatment GH increase IGF-I IGFBP3 level also plasmatic level fast insulin long term net result combination unknown . An analysis show , although first 2 year GH treatment , sign glucose intolerance even though less sensitivity insulin , could great incidence type 2 diabetes deficient child treat GH long period . Treatment GH , child bear SGA caught-up growth 4 year age , majority case achieve good initial growth speed increase order continue grow within normal limit end adult height fall within normal . This achieve authorised daily dose 0.035 mg/kg ( 1 mg/m2/day ) . However , question regard possible metabolic consequence GH treatment bear SGA remain unanswered form , find GH treatment increase reduce resistance insulin associate metabolic parameter therefore , risk develop type 2 diabetes . Continued monitor adult height cohort subject bear SGA treat GH efficient , easy comfortable tool answer question . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To quantify evolution insulin sensitivity start treatment GH adult stature reach . Sensitivity resistance insulin calculate use HOMA-IR model ( Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance ) reliable easy mathematical model use follow formula : insulinemia ( Î¼U/ml ) x glycemia ( mmol/l ) /22.5 . Secondary objective : - To find predictive factor possible change insulin sensitivity complex associate obesity , hypertension high triglyceride type dyslipidemia low high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -cholesterol . For , relation metabolic factor auxological parameter identify . . The following consider independent predictive variable : - Speed growth cm/ year - Standard deviation height - IGF-I ng/ml - IGFBP-3 ng/ml b . The dependent variable : - HOMA-IR value - Triglycerides rate mg/dl / HDL-cholesterol mg/dl - Blood pressure mmHG - Body mass index This observational study single cohort , without possibility control group bear SGA , experience catch-up growth enter normal auxology within first four year life subject paediatric follow-up similar catch-up normal auxology treat GH . Therefore , auxological metabolic test result available standard care . The collection say parameter require `` ad hoc '' intervention study would experimental interventional . The observation period study encompass start treatment GH year finish treatment reason . The starting age well time treatment end vary per subject . However , subject finish treatment adulthood reach . In accordance clinical study , average observation period probably 10 year . After basal data make available , collection data afterwards carry year per subject .</detailed_description>
