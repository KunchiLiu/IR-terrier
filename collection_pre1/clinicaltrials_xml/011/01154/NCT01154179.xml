	<brief_summary>During patient ' stay hospital , patient may require artificial feed various reason either vein tube go directly gut . However , amount feeding consider 'adequate ' unclear due lack research data . The current evidence investigator suggest doctor might give patient require , might carry risk . This n't proven evidence yet show investigator exactly much doctor fee patient . The aim study see whether feed patient less currently fee associate well outcome . The patient randomly ( like toss coin ) allocate 2 group . One group get 100 % current amount ; second group get 60 % . The investigator compare group decide feed patient less current practice associate well outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Appropriate Controlled Feeding : Single Blinded Prospective Randomised Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : The primary aim study ass whether hypocaloric feed patient receive artificial nutritional support associate reduce septic non septic morbidity compare `` standard '' nutritional support . Secondary end point include assessment metabolic , physiological clinical response different feeding protocol . ENTERAL FEEDING OBJECTIVES 1 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive enteral artificial nutritional support associate reduce septic non septic morbidity compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 2 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive enteral artificial nutritional support associate change inflammatory response compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 3 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive enteral artificial nutritional support associate change metabolic response compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 4 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive enteral artificial nutritional support associate change nutrition status compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 5 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive enteral artificial nutritional support associate difference systemic complication compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 6 . To undertake cost benefit analysis patient receive enteral artificial nutritional support , assumption patient receive hypocaloric feed necessarily manifest low feeding cost . PARENTERAL FEEDING OBJECTIVES 1 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive parenteral artificial nutritional support associate reduce septic non septic morbidity compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 2 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive parenteral artificial nutritional support associate change inflammatory response compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 3 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive parenteral artificial nutritional support associate change metabolic response compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 4 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive parenteral artificial nutritional support associate change nutrition status compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 5 . To investigate whether hypocaloric feed patient receive parenteral artificial nutritional support associate difference systemic complication compare `` standard '' nutritional support . 6 . To undertake cost benefit analysis patient receive parenteral artificial nutritional support , assumption patient receive hypocaloric feed necessarily manifest low feeding cost . Study Design Study Group : This single blind , randomize control clinical trial . All patient require adjuvant nutritional support include study . The need nutritional support method administration ( enteral parenteral ) decide hospital 's nutrition team present practice . Clinically , patient require supplemental nutrition fall two clinical group . Those functional gut feed enterally ; group , whose gut , whatever reason , functional fed parenterally . This rationale study two group administration . Please see Flowchart exact detail . Patients enter parenteral enteral component stud mutually exclusive manner crossover randomisation occur point . Thereafter , patient either arm study ( enteral parenteral ) randomise one two group . Comparisons do within , across , enteral parenteral arm . Enteral feeding detail : Enteral control group : patient receive energy protein intake recommend use Schofield equation ( TER=total energy requirement ) , current practice . Enteral intervention group : patient prescribe 60 % recommend ( Schofield ) requirement . Parenteral feeding detail : Parenteral control group : control group , receive energy protein intake recommend use Schofield equation , current practice . Parenteral intervention group : patient prescribe 60 % recommend ( Schofield ) requirement . Data analysis `` intention treat '' basis . Enteral parenteral study arm analyse separately .</detailed_description>
