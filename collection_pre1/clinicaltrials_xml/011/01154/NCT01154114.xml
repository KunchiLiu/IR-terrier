	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Darapladib Moderately Hepatically Impaired Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , non-randomised study ass pharmacokinetics safety/tolerability repeat oral 40 mg dos darapladib subject moderate hepatic impairment ( define Child-Pugh score 7-9 ) comparison match healthy volunteer . The hepatically impaired healthy volunteer group receive repeat oral dos darapladib 10 consecutive day . The pharmacokinetics darapladib metabolite evaluate . The effect liver impairment plasma protein bind darapladib metabolite also determine data permit . Safety assess clinical laboratory test ( hematology , chemistry urinalysis ) , vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate measurement ) , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) monitor adverse event ( AEs ) . Subjects house clinical unit even first dose 24 hour final dose 10 day repeat dose . A follow-up period include 2 visit , one conduct approximately 10-14 day last dose study drug second visit 35 day +/- one week last dose study drug</detailed_description>
