	<brief_summary>Both patient peripheral structural pathology , like rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) -patients , patient central sensitivity syndrome ( CSS ) suffer chronic pain . CSS characterize increased responsiveness central pain neuron . An impaired endogenous pain inhibition already demonstrate CSS . In present study investigator want evaluate efficacy pain inhibition response physical stressor whether efficacy opioid-mediated two chronic pain population ( RA &amp; CCS ) compare control . Therefore triple-blinded randomized control trial ( RCT ) cross-over design perform . The efficacy wind-up pain spatial summation pain evaluate submaximal exercise , experimental group receive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . Participants 20 RA-patients 20 CSS-patients , specific patient fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome , 30 healthy control . This way , investigator analyze pain inhibition react different type physical stressor different pain patient pain inhibition opioid-mediated .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Each study participant age 18 65 year . All three group comparable age , gender , education level socioeconomic status ; patient group comparable illness duration . The Central Sensitivity Syndrome ( CSS ) group comply diagnostic criterion Fibromyalgia ( FM ) define American College Rheumatology Centre Disease Control criteria Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ( CFS ) . At time study participation , healthy control subject suffer pain complaint . Sedentary define sedentary job &lt; 3 h moderate physical activity/week . Moderate physical activity define activity demand least threefold energy spend passively . Patients able cycle bicycle ergometer . In order preclude confound factor , participant pregnant ( pregnancy test ) 1 year postnatal ask stop medication two week prior study participation , undertake physical exertion , refrain consume caffeine , alcohol nicotine day experiment . For ethical reason , Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient able take nonopioid pain medication describe 1st step World Health Organization analgesic ladder ( NonSteroidal AntiInflammatory Drugs paracetamol ) .</criteria>
