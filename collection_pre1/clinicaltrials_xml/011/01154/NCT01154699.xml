	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic respiratory disease characterize airway inflammation airway hyperresponsiveness , cause airflow obstruction . It extremely prevalent , affect estimate 22 million Americans , costly loss productivity direct healthcare cost billion dollar . The incidence prevalence asthma increase , US around world . This increase come despite great understanding inflammatory allergic basis asthma , despite good antiinflammatory medication . One explanation increase prevalence asthma concomitant increase obesity , majority Americans overweight obese . Numerous study convincingly link asthma obesity , demonstrate increased obstruction weight gain decreased obstruction weight loss . However , mechanism underlie linkage know . We believe low lung volume contribute pathogenesis severity asthma . End-expiratory lung volume decrease obesity , likely fall sleep , particularly overweight obese patient . Both upper low airway resistance increase decrease lung volume , airways become small . However , prior work show low airway resistance increase proportion decrease lung volume occur sleep asthma patient . This difference control people asthma explore , yet may provide insight asthma pathogenesis provide potential target therapy . Therefore , propose series experiment define impact lung volume sleep airway resistance . One experiment test hypothesis lung stretch use therapeutically tonically dynamically increase lung volume sleep use bi-level positive airway pressure . This research help delineate asthma pathogenesis may help improve therapeutic option exceedingly common disease .</detailed_description>
