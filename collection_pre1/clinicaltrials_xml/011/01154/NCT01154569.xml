	<brief_summary>Bariatric ( obesity ) surgery become preferred treatment option patient severe obesity increase popularity . It commonly perform , nearly 350 000 operation world every year . The common type bariatric surgery gastric bypass , stomach size reduce 95 % upper intestine bypass . Bypass upper intestine may lead medication malabsorption , although potential adverse effect receive little study . The objective study determine whether gastric bypass reduces absorption azithromycin , medication commonly prescribe first-line infection , especially pneumonia . Patients non-surgical control receive single dose azithromycin highly standardize study condition . The absorption azithromycin calculate compare surgical non-surgical study group . The investigator hypothesis significant reduction absorption azithromycin gastric bypass patient compare non-surgical control . This raise possibility post-gastric bypass patient treat azithromycin may fail respond treatment , become bad even die . This study important implication large number past future gastric bypass recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Absorption Drugs Post-Bariatric Surgery ( Absorb-Azithromycin )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past decade , bariatric surgery emerge preferred treatment option patient either severe obesity [ body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 40 kg/m2 ] moderate obesity ( BMI 35.0-39.9 kg/m2 ) major medical complication ( e.g. , diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea ) . Surgery reduce weight 33 % 2-3 year , associate improvement obesity-related comorbidities , mortality quality life . Consequently , demand bariatric surgery increase exponential rate Canada , United States globally , 350 000 estimate surgery perform annually globally . Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass commonly perform type bariatric procedure . This operation restrict stomach capacity 5 % original size bypass duodenum much jejunum . The major adverse consequence intestinal bypass nutrient malabsorption lead deficiency iron , fat-soluble vitamin vitamin B12 . The malabsorption drug , many design maximally absorb upper small intestine , also major potential concern . Surprisingly , issue receive surprisingly little attention publish literature . A number factor may contribute reduced absorption post-bypass , delay gastric emptying , reduce intestinal transit time , diminish opportunity mucosal exposure , change drug solubility result alteration intestinal pH . Azithromycin , macrolide antibiotic interferes ribosomal protein synthesis , indicate treatment respiratory tract , skin/soft tissue , sinus pelvic infection . Azithromycin commonly prescribe orally treatment community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , recommend first-line treatment patient condition manage outpatient basis . CAP account 1 million physician visit , 60 000 hospital admission , 640 000 day restrict activity ( together influenza ) 6th lead cause death United States . In Edmonton , least 50 % CAP manage outpatient therapy . Post-bariatric surgery patient develop CAP treat outpatient oral antibiotic would clearly risk treatment failure antibiotic optimally absorb . Treatment failure may pose significant risk respiratory complication death . Unfortunately , study examine absorption antibiotic post-gastric bypass . Because , azithromycin intrinsically poorly absorb , bioavailability 38 % , suboptimal absorption post-gastric bypass major concern . The purpose study determine whether gastric bypass result clinically significant reduction azithromycin absorption .</detailed_description>
