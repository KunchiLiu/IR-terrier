	<brief_summary>A study evaluate pazopanib tablet male female adult non-child bear potential subfoveal CNV due neovascular AMD . The goal ass safety well subject tolerate drug . The study also look body break metabolizes drug . All subject start study 8 day prior receive drug . Once started subject take one tablet day 28 day . A follow visit occur approximately 2 week drug stop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Pazopanib Tablets Patients Who Have Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open label study pazopanib administer 28 day adult patient subfoveal CNV due neovascular AMD . The primary aim evaluate safety tolerability patient neovascular AMD secondary aim evaluate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics . This study include control treatment group ( e.g . placebo active comparator ) , instead benchmarked visual acuity OCT change observe follow treatment anti-angiogenic agent similar patient population treatment period . All subject receive tablet administer daily . Subjects screen within eight day prior treatment assignment initiation study treatment . The duration treatment 28 day , subject participate baseline four subsequent weekly study visit treatment phase . Subjects also return follow-up visit approximately two week last dose study medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Agerelated macular degeneration patient diagnose subfoveal choroidal neovascularization study eye , follow characteristic require confirmed central reading center : CNV cause AMD extend geometric center foveal avascular zone CNV comprise ≥ 50 % lesion area Total lesion area great 12 disc area fluorescein angiography , lesion complex include CNV , blood , block fluorescence blood , serous detachment retinal pigment epithelium classic CNV comprise &lt; 50 % lesion area fibrosis comprise ≤ 25 % lesion area Center subfield &gt; 320 micron SDOCT ( inclusive subretinal fluid ) evidence classic CNV , presume recent disease progression deterioration ( ≥ 5 letter decrease vision evidence growth CNV lesion fluorescein angiography ) within last 3 month evidence hemorrhage CNV Bestcorrected ETDRS visual acuity score study eye 25 73 letter ( approximately equivalent Snellen VA 20/320 20/32 ) screening . Male female ≥ 50 year age . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential define either premenopausal document tubal ligation hysterectomy , postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . In questionable case postmenopausal status blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) value consistent local laboratory recommend value confirmatory . Subject willing able return study visit , willing able comply protocol requirement procedure . Subject capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . If subject unable read consent form due visual impairment consent must read subject verbatim person administer consent , family member legally acceptable representative . ( Note : Consent legally acceptable representative allow accordance local law , regulation ethic committee policy . ) QTcF &lt; 450msec ; QTcF &lt; 480msec subject Bundle Branch Block . AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Additional eye disease study eye could compromise bestcorrected visual acuity ( e.g . glaucoma document visual field loss , clinically significant diabetic retinopathy , ischemic optic neuropathy , infection retinitis pigmentosa ) . CNV study eye due cause unrelated agerelated macular degeneration . The presence retinal angiomatous proliferation ( RAP ) study eye , determine investigator ( confirmation indocyanine green angiography require ) . Geographic atrophy involve center fovea study eye . Anterior segment vitreous abnormality study eye would preclude adequate observation fundus photograph , fluorescein angiography SDOCT . Vitreous , subretinal retinal hemorrhage study eye unrelated AMD . Any previous treatment study eye neovascular AMD , approve investigational . Current intravitreal antiVEGF therapy fellow eye . Within 6 month prior Screening Visit , use systemically administer antiangiogenic agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab , sunitinib , cetuximab , sorafenib , pazopanib ) , approve investigational . Intraocular surgery study eye within 3 month dose . Aphakia total absence posterior capsule ( Yttrium aluminum garnet ( YAG ) capsulotomy permit ) study eye . History vitrectomy study eye . Presence RPE tear study eye . Subject uncontrolled glaucoma ( intraocular pressure &gt; 25 mmHg ) despite treatment antiglaucoma medication . Within 6 month prior Screening Visit , use medication know toxic retina , lens optic nerve ( e.g . desferoximine , chloroquine/hydrochloroquine , chlorpromazine , phenothiazine , tamoxifen , nicotinic acid , ethambutol ) . Use systemic steroid ( &gt; 10 mg prednisone equivalent/day ) within 14 day first dose . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Medical history unresolved medical condition , example : Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus , hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) &gt; 10 % Myocardial infarction stroke within 6 month screen Active bleed disorder Major surgery within 3 month screen Hepatic impairment Clinically relevant thyroid disease Uncontrolled hypertension , base criterion provide Section 4.4.1.2 . Subject history within past 2 year alcohol , substance abuse , psychiatric disorder likely confound efficacy safety assessment . A history know HIV infection . Use prohibit medication list Section 9.2 within restrict timeframe relative first dose study medication . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . A condition situation , , opinion investigator , may result significant risk patient , confound study result interfere significantly participation . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation .</criteria>
