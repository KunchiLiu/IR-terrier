	<brief_summary>Central venous catheterization ( CVC ) ICU common . It associate many complication . These complication well identify literature . They primarily mechanical , infectious thrombotic event . Many measure take reduce choice insertion site , strict aseptic technique insertion type catheter use . However , despite measure , appear incidence complication still high . The technique ultra-sound guide ( USG ) catheter insertion show effectiveness reduce complication general ICU population . The increase obesity general population accompany increase obese population ICU ( BMI &gt; 30 kg.m-2 ) . Many study investigate effect obesity morbidity mortality ICU . Some study find high rate catheter infection obese patient . Moreover , insertion central venous catheter technically difficult obese patient . To investigator knowledge study impact USG central venous catheterization obese patient ICU . The objective prospective randomize control study demonstrate superiority USG central venous catheterization ( jugular femoral ) complication population obese patient . 450 patient include dispatched two group ( jugular femoral ) accord choose site catheter insertion . In group , patient randomize USG technique usual anatomical technique . The rate complication ( mechanical , thrombotic infectious ) primary endpoint . Secondary endpoint follow : rate catheter colonization , rate catheter-related bacteremia , rate failure insertion , number puncture , procedure timing mortality The investigator hope establish benefit use USG central venous catheterization obese ICU patient thus contribute improve quality care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Study Influence Ultrasound Guidance Complications Central Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determination insertion technique The insertion technique ( anatomical landmark ultrasound-guided ) determine randomization . To aim , use software available intranet server available ICUs involve study . All central venous catheter include study insert experienced physician train use ultrasound placement access ( minimum 2 previous CVC installation ultrasound ) . The central catheter use study ( Arrow International , Inc. ) single , double triple lumen ( 16 20 cm length ) . The choice make clinician patient management . Catheters impregnate antibiotic antiseptic exclude . The ultrasound use Site~Rite ® V ( C.R . Bard Inc ) type equip multifrequency probe 5-10 MHz . Acts examination perform protocol : - Systematic culture CVC achievement blood culture case hyperthermia - Systematic ultrasound examination D4 look thrombosis . The examination necessary sample require strict follow-up patient make ICUs participate study send usual laboratory analysis . Ultrasounds perform physician department participate study . The primary endpoint rate complication relate composite criterion incorporate mechanical , thrombotic infectious complication . The secondary endpoint : - Rate failure / success place catheter ( failure define three skin biopsy lead lay venous access ) . - The time require installation CVC ( time first puncture introduction catheter ) - The number puncture final lay - Type complication accord method site installation - The overall mortality accord technique use - The duration stay ICU / hospital We define complication follow : - Mechanical complication : - Number fail insertion , - Number bleeding require compression 30 minute , - Number arterial wound , - Number misposition visualize radiological picture , - Rare complication ( pneumothorax , hematoma , air embolism ) . - Infectious complication ( accord recommendation Twelfth Conference Society Consensus resuscitation French updated 2002 ) : - Colonization catheter : Positive culture ( ≥ 1 000 CFU / ml ) accord quantitative method describe Brun-Buisson catheter 's distal end ( 4-5 cm ) aseptically remove . This technique diagnose colonization induce subcutaneous infection , also intra vascular pathway . However , differentiate mode colonization . - Catheter-related infection : - In absence bacteremia , diagnosis catheter-related infection base : - positive culture ( &gt; 1 000 CFU / ml ) total partial regression sign infection within 48 hour catheter removal - purulence inlet catheter - tunnelite . - Bacteremic infection relate C.V.C . define : - association one positive bacteremia occur within 48 hour withdrawal CVC ( two case Staphylococcus epidermidis ) positive culture insertion site organism culture CVC &gt; 1 000 CFU / ml organism - quantitative central / peripheral blood culture ratio &gt; 5 - differential blood culture positivity delay &gt; 2 hour . - The infection NOT relate CVC : - CVC finally sterile - CVC culture positive , strain different isolate blood / focus infection present removal CVC sepsis regress removal CVC - CVC culture positive strain identical find infected site find least 48 hour removal CVC whether responsible bacteremia sepsis regress removal CVC . - Thrombotic complication : A venous Echo-Doppler exploration perform within four day follow catheter ablation look loss compressibility venous segment pressure probe associate intravascular image measure 3 mm anteroposterior diameter ( maximum diameter ) .</detailed_description>
