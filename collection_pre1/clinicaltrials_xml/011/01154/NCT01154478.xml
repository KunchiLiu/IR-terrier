	<detailed_description>Fish consumption associate low cardiovascular risk dietary supplementation ω-3 fatty acid reduces plasma triglyceride level . The mechanisms action ω-3 fatty acid currently completely understood . It hypothesize polyunsaturated ω-3 fatty acid beneficial effect may mediate ability facilitate plasmalogen replenishment . Polyphenols associate beneficial effect cardiovascular risk factor , particular reduce lipid oxidation . Less data available effect lipid metabolism . Recent data suggest effect could mediate change plasmalogen level . The effect lipid metabolism combine two dietary approach ( ω-3 fatty acid polyphenols ) know . While developed population live part postprandial state , much information lipid metabolism refers fast condition . Dietary Intervention Study Design Eighty people high cardiovascular risk randomly assign one four different nutritional 8-week intervention : ( A ) Control diet poor omega-3 fatty acid polyphenols ( B ) Diet rich omega-3 fatty acid ( C ) Diet rich polyphenols ( D ) Diet rich omega-3 fatty acid polyphenols</detailed_description>
