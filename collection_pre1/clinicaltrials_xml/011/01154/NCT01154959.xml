	<brief_summary>The immune response latent tuberculosis poorly understood . While difficult define onset latency natural infection , patient undergo treatment tuberculosis drive state latency cure . The present study effect 3 4 month regimen contain moxifloxacin sputum smear culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis ( TRC Study number 24 ) offer u opportunity study definitive immune response pre post treatment . We evaluate variety innate adaptive immune response patient treatment study compare difference immuno-phenotype ( eg . Markers T , B NK cell activation , proliferation regulatory phenotype ) function ( eg . Production cytokine , proliferative response TB antigen ) different time point follow treatment . In addition , since small percentage patient undergo relapse follow treatment , kinetics immune response patient use assess immunological predictor relapse tuberculosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infect approximately 2 billion people worldwide , 90 % Mtb infected individual able resist overt disease ( active tuberculosis ) development manifest latent infection . Latent tuberculosis ( TB ) define persistent presence live Mtb within infect host without cause disease . It characterize delay type hypersensitivity response purify protein derivative ( PPD ) mediate mycobacteria specific T cell . During latency , Mtb contain localize granuloma mycobacteria reside macrophage growth replication appear constrain . Maintenance granulomatous lesion mediate CD4+ CD8+ T cell . Based murine model , immunity Mtb require Th1 response ( less extent ) Th17 response . Thus , IL 12 , IFN gamma , TNF alpha ( IL 17 IL 23 ) play important role induction maintenance protective immune response tuberculous disease . Although CD4+ T lymphocytes Th1 type critical protective immunity , evidence exists CD8+ T cell well unconventional T cell ( gamma-delta T cell CD 1 restrict T cell ) contribute optimum protection susceptible animal model . Aside produce cytokine activate macrophage initiate granuloma formation , T cell also direct mycobactericidal activity concert action perforins granulysins . T cell differentiation Th1 Th2 lineage base cytokine profile transcription factor expression serve basis understand pathogenesis variety infectious allergic disease . With advent new technique , T cell differentiation expand several subset , include Tregs , Th17 cell , polyfunctional T cell , among others . Th1 cell absolutely essential resistance TB mouse human . Deficiencies IL 12 IFN gamma Stat1 pathway lead disseminated mycobacterial infection human abrogation resistance mouse . In addition , TNF alpha , another Th1 cytokine , almost equal importance , treatment biologics ( e.g. , anti TNF alpha antibody ) inflammatory disorder rheumatoid arthritis cause reactivation TB individual . Latent TB maintain lifetime individual unless immunological balance host pathogen perturb , result reactivation Mtb active disease . The host environmental factor involve compromise ability contain latent infection human immunodeficiency virus co infection , malnutrition , age , stress , Type 2 diabetes , use immunosuppressive agent , genetic factor . On pathogen side , latency think reflect transition replicate nonreplicating dormant bacillus , transition influence variety factor include oxygen deprivation nitric oxide . The use vitro vivo model latency combine genome wide transcriptome profiling lead identification Mtb gene highly express latency call dosR devR ( dormancy ) gene ; however , host pathogen related factor control resistance and/or susceptibility TB await complete elucidation . The subset CD4+ T cell constitute ever expand repertoire , classify discrete cytokine profile often expression prototypical transcription factor and/or cell surface molecule . Two relatively newly emerge CD4+ T cell subset importance Th17 cell , characterize production IL 17 family cytokine , regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) , characterize surface expression CD25 transcription factor FoxP3 . Little known role two subset latent TB . The mechanism Mtb subvert immune response establish chronic , latent infection also well understood . Recently , number regulatory factor , include Tregs , IL 10 , TGF-beta , CTLA 4 , PD 1 , implicate establishment chronic viral , bacterial , parasitic infection . The role T , B NK cell evolution immune response follow therapy Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection elucidate . The development cellular immune response TB-infected patient post-chemotherapy delineate cellular arm immunity response crude define TB antigen treat patient need study .</detailed_description>
