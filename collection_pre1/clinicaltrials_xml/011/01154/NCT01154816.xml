	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine objective response rate MLN8237 ( alisertib ) child relapse refractory solid tumor leukemias , administer daily 7 day every 21 day . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define describe toxicity MLN8237 administer schedule . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics MLN8237 child refractory cancer . III . To evaluate aurora A kinase expression use immunohistochemistry solid tumor leukemic blast tissue obtain diagnosis , available , relapse . IV . To explore relationship polymorphic variation UDP-glucuronosyltransferase gene UGT1A1 exposure MLN8237 , assess 2 common polymorphic variant aurora A kinase gene , Phe31Ile Val57Ile . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord type tumor ( measurable neuroblastoma v neuroblastoma metaiodobenzylguanidine [ MIBG ] -positive lesion vs osteosarcoma v Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor [ PNET ] v rhabdosarcoma v non-rhabdomyosarcoma [ RMS ] soft tissue sarcoma v hepatoblastoma v malignant germ cell tumor v Wilms tumor v acute myeloid leukemia [ AML ] v acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ ALL ] v rhabdoid tumor ) .

ARM VI ( NON-RMS SOFT TISSUE SARCOMA ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM VII ( HEPATOBLASTOMA ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM VIII ( MALIGNANT GERM CELL TUMOR ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM IX ( WILMS TUMOR ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM X ( ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM XI ( ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM XII ( RHABDOID MALIGNANCY ) : Patients receive alisertib PO QD day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 35 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Plasma sample collect patient baseline periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
