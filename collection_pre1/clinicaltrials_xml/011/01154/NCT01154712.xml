	<detailed_description>Deep Low-Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation cessation pathological gamble Introduction : Pathological gambling ( PG ) characterize persistent pattern continue gamble behavior despite adverse consequence . PG chronic , progressive , male-dominated disorder , prevalence 1 % 3.4 % among US adult . Typically , patient 's life become dominated gamble behavior lead overwhelming financial burden , inability maintain career , eventual disintegration family relationship . The enormous personal social consequence disorder include high rate suicide attempt , legal problem , criminal behavior [ R1 ] . Several theoretical model drug addiction suggest addiction relate abnormal activity ventromedial prefrontal cortex system , necessary inhibit crave immediate reward excitement-seeking behavior [ ref2 ] . Neuropsychological study pathological gambler [ ref 3to9 ref2 ref10 ] demonstrate pathological gambler deficit frontal lobe/reward system lead investigator hypothesize impairment executive function may play important role etiology pathological gambling . Drawing field drug dependence , speculate underlying pathology pathological gamble reduction sensitivity reward system . Reuter et al studied pathological gambler control guess game use functional magnetic resonance image observe reduction ventral striatal ventromedial prefrontal activation pathological gambler negatively correlate gamble severity , link hypo-activation area disease severity [ ref11 ] . Studies field addiction show prefrontal regulation behavior reduce basal condition , thereby contribute reduce salience non-drug motivational stimulus reduce decision-making ability . However , stimuli predict drug availability present , profound activation prefrontal cortex glutamatergic drive nucleus accumbens [ ref12 ] . Potenza et al functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrate male pathological gambler show relatively reduced activity frontal orbitofrontal cortex , caudate basal ganglion thalamus compare control present visual gamble cue [ ref13 ] .Recent neurobehavioral study demonstrate poor performance test executive function pathological gambler suggest financial risk-taking behavior see PG may associate dorsolateral prefrontal orbitofrontal cortex dysfunction [ ref 14-17 ] .Neuropsychological study PGs demonstrate PGs deficit frontal lobe/reward system [ ref18 ref10 ] .Patients pathological gamble demonstrate great decrease bind potential ventral striatum gambling ( 13.9 % ) control patient ( 8.1 % ) , likely reflect great dopaminergic release . Ventral striatal binding baseline control task also low patient pathological gamble [ ref19 ] . Reductions right prefrontal activity decision-making appear modulate presence gamble problem may reflect impaired work memory , stimulus reward valuation , cue reactivity substance dependent individual [ ref20 ] . PG related response perseveration diminish reward punishment sensitivity indicate hypoactivation ventrolateral prefrontal cortex money gain lose . Moreover , intact plan ability normal dorsal frontostriatal responsiveness indicate deficit due impaired executive functioning . Response perseveration ventral prefrontal hypo-responsiveness monetary loss may markers maladaptive behavior see chemical non-chemical addiction [ ref21 ] . In one study , subject 10 match healthy control subject underwent fMRI visual presentation gambling-related video alternate video nature scene . Pathological gamble subject control subject exhibit overlap area brain activity response visual gambling cue ; however , compare control subject , PG subject exhibit significantly great activity right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , include inferior medial frontal gyrus , right parahippocampal gyrus , leave occipital cortex , include fusiform gyrus [ R22 ] . It report High-frequency ( 20-Hz ) rTMS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex reduce cigarette smoke significantly [ ref23 ] .In another study , find multiple high-frequency rTMS DLPFC attenuate nicotine crave [ ref 24 ] .Regarding cocaine addiction treatment TMS , show one session 10Hz rTMS right , leave , DLPFC transiently reduce crave cocaine dependent individual [ ref25 ] .Politi et al . conduct study include thirty-six subject fulfil DSM-IV criterion cocaine dependence . Subjects treat 20 train TMS apply left prefrontal cortex frequency 15 Hz intensity 100 % motor threshold . Repeated measure analyse variance show cocaine crave gradually reduce session TMS [ ref26 ] . Hypothesis Assuming substance addiction pathological gamble share similar patho-physiology consider evidence transcranial magnetic stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ameliorate addiction smoke [ ref23 ] cocaine [ ref26 ] hypothesize transcranial magnetic stimulation may also reduce gamble `` crave '' pathological gambler . H-coil place frontal cortex exerts significant effect entire ipsilateral cortical hemisphere , significantly less contralateral hemisphere [ ref27 ] .Thus , H-coil place DLPFC hypothesize exert direct consistent effect cortical subcortical region anterior cingulate nucleus accumbens ( ventral striatum ) , compare figure-8 coil . Because region consider play role drug crave addiction , rTMS apply H-coil may effective reduce drug crave rTMS apply standard figure-8 coil . Deep TMS : Deep TMS currently evaluate treatment option major depression . It show safe procedure [ ref28 , ref29 ] . The innovative design Brainsway H-Coils intend generate sufficient magnetic field strength stimulate neuron deep inside brain mass without pose hazard . This forms basis Brainsway H-Coil use deep rTMS device . The coil design maximize electrical field deep brain summation separate field project skull several point around periphery . The device also minimize accumulation electrical charge surface brain , give rise electrostatic field might reduce magnitude induced electric field surface inside , reduce depth penetration induce electric field [ ref30 ] . The unique shape device 's base include wire coil contain several wire strip , set tangentially scalp 's surface . Each set strip connect series contain current flow direction , therefore generate field extend brain specified orientation location along scalp . Computerized theoretical calculation make order optimize coil design maximize percentage stimulation depth relative cortical region . These , conjunction test perform phantom model , [ ref 30 , ref28 , ref27 ] demonstrated ability stimulate , mean H-Coil , deep brain region . It may assume activation deep brain region interconnect fiber may serve new approach treat neuropsychiatry illness prominent advantage standard coil , unable affect region deep H-Coil . Deep TMS could effective rTMS due deep penetration brain tissue [ ref28 ] . The deep penetration produce great action nerve fiber connect prefrontal cortex limbic system . In randomize control study deep transcranial magnetic stimulation conduct Israel , 32 healthy volunteer ( 9 test H1 coil present report ) evaluate possible cognitive impairment . Cognitive evaluation conduct use Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) , sensitive cognitive change cause wide range Central Nervous System disorder medication side-effects . No deterioration cognitive function find , except transient short-term effect H1-coil spatial recognition memory first day rTMS ( follow treatment day ) . Questionnaires conduct emotional mood alteration , show significant change except report 'detachment ' experienced subject treat H1-coil.In addition , stimulation novel H-coils found well tolerate , adverse physical neurological outcome [ ref29 ] . Contraindications deep TMS essentially rTMS . Absolute contraindication include history metal object head , know history metallic particle eye , implanted cardiac pacemaker intra-cardiac line , implanted neurostimulators , surgical clip medical pump , history cochlear implant history seizure heat convulsion . Relative contraindication include epilepsy seizure first degree relative , history head injury ; frequent severe headache , migraine ; hear loss ; drug abuse alcoholism , pregnancy use reliable method birth control systemic metabolic disorder .
