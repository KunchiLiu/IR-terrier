	<brief_summary>Induction therapy antibody administer transplant surgery short period time follow transplant surgery effort render immune system less able mount initial rejection response . In general , induction therapy associate well outcome compare absence induction therapy . However , currently use induction agent , label indicated induction therapy transplantation , drawback relate long-term immune system suppression increase susceptibility opportunistic infection malignancy , immune-mediated side effect . An unmet medical need exists specific approach prevent acute organ rejection , without unnecessarily expose patient non-specific open-ended immune suppression , may exacerbate risk infection malignancy . TOL101 novel antibody target specific immune cell type critical acute organ rejection response . In two-part study , TOL101 evaluate prophylaxis acute organ rejection use part immunosuppressive regimen include steroid , MMF , tacrolimus first time kidney transplant recipient . This study test hypothesis specific approach ( TOL101 ) prevention acute organ rejection may provide similar good efficacy currently use induction antibody ( Anti-Thymocyte Globulin Thymoglobulin ) carry few risk term opportunistic infection , malignancy adverse effect .</brief_summary>
