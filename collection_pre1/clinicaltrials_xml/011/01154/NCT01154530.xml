It known bacterial content stomach low due acidic environment bacteria pass mouth throat endoscope could potentially result bacterial peritonitis . That bacteria throat lead infection due instrumentation know intensive care unit . Ventilated patient may risk get pneumonia bacteria throat . Several study show use mouthwash chlorhexidine solution reduce risk ventilator associate pneumonia . Hypothesis : Mouthwash 2 cl 0,2 % chlorhexidine solution gastroscopy reduce bacterial content culture take stomach endoscope gastroscopy . Simultaneous PPI treatment give high bacterial count culture . Trial Participants : Trial Participants recruit among patient refer gastroscopy outpatient setting , Herlev , Gentofte Bispebjerg Hospital . Participants must 18 year old regardless gender . The participant include oral write information trial write consent . The request participation write information trial send patient conventional mail . The oral information give day gastroscopy . Inclusion trial consequence purpose gastroscopy , diagnostic procedure treatment . Trial Participants may time withdraw trial without consequence . Method : Included participant randomize draw random envelope continuous registration number contain information whether patient allocate intervention control group . Enclosed envelope registration form follow record : sex , age , weight , height , indication gastroscopy , number instrumentation gastroscopy , use rinse suction , PPI treatment . Participants intervention group perform mouthwash 2 cl 0,2 % chlorhexidine 30 second immediately gastroscopy . Participants control group perform mouthwash gastroscopy . The gastroscopy perform accordance indication . A total 2 culture sample take participant . The culture sample send department clinical microbiology , Herlev Hospital cultivation , bacterial count typing . The first culture sample take instill 50ml sterile saline instrumentation channel gastroscope locate fundus stomach . Approximately 10ml aspirated channel antrum stomach . The second culture sample take gastroscope procedure rinse instrumentation channel sterile saline . A sample approximately 10 ml collect distal end gastroscope . Samples mark respective continuous registration number accord randomization . Side effect , discomfort risk : There side effect associate use chlorhexidine mouthwash . There discomfort associate gastroscopy . This result participation trial . Many patient feel slight discomfort gastroscope pass throat . The passage stimulate vomit reflex . For reason gastroscopy always perform patient leave lateral position ensure free airway . There may mild soreness irritation throat first day gastroscopy . The discomfort directly link participation trial taste chlorhexidine mouthwash half participant . There risk associate participation trial , although risk associate gastroscopy . These bleed stomach wall perforation stomach duodenum . These complication rare . Ethics : Since participant recruit referral gastroscopy general practitioner indication gastroscopy already assess outweighs mention rare risk . The discomfort directly relate trail brief sensation bad taste mouth half participant . The result gain trial greatly overshadow mild discomfort associate taste chlorhexidine mouthwash . Economy : The mention trial part PhD project try bridge gap animal study implementation NOTES daily clinical practice . Salaries fund grant University Copenhagen , Herlev Hospital Research Council Capitol Region Denmark Research Foundation Health Research . Operating cost found grant private foundation . There commercial interest support project .</detailed_description>
