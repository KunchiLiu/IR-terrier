	<brief_summary>This phase III , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , placebo-controlled study compare efficacy 6-months therapy ropinirole Prolonged Release ( PR ) placebo adjunctive therapy L-dopa Parkinson 's disease patient optimally control L-dopa . This study conduct China . Subjects total 14 visit 26 week duration study . Following screening , eligible subject receive study medication fourteen day placebo run-in period instruct take addition background L-dopa . If subject still eligible end placebo run-in period randomize ( 1:1 ) receive daily dos ropinirole PR identical appear placebo tablet . Dosing start 2 mg ropinirole PR , placebo equivalent . During 24 week treatment phase , subject dose adjust accord recommended schedule achieve symptomatic control . All subject must titrate minimum dose 6 mg/day . If sufficient symptomatic control achieve maintain dose 6mg/day ropinirole PR , daily dose increase 2mg weekly long interval dose 8mg/day.If sufficient symptomatic control still achieve maintain dose 8mg/day ropinirole PR , daily dose increased 4mg two weekly long interval . Further dose titration conduct within final 8 week treatment phase . The maximum recommended daily dose 24mg . The planned reduction L-dopa dose begin subject titrate Dose Level 4 Dose Level 5 study medication . For increase study medication , correspond decrease L-dopa . If loss symptom control occur reduction background L-dopa dose , dose study medication increase next high dose level adjustment dose L-dopa . If loss symptom control persist , subject titrate additional dose level . Subjects experience improvement symptom follow upward titration 2 dose level study medication , `` rescue '' L-dopa . Subjects dispense down-titration medication study completion/early withdrawal visit patient enter extension study schedule return follow visit 4 14 day last dose study medication . The extension study aim evaluate safety profile ReQuip PR long-term treatment subject advance parkinson 's disease .</brief_summary>
