	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) without expiratory positive airway pressure ( EPAP ) ( inspiratory positive airway pressure ( IPAP ) -only ) result increase patient usage NIPPV compare standard , Bi-level NIPPV . Secondarily , investigator assess measure dyspnea , quality life , patient satisfaction , side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Standard Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation ( NIPPV ) Low Expiratory Pressure NIPPV ALS Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize 1:1 basis one two group differ sequence NIPPV setting ( ( ) standard , Bi-level NIPPV follow IPAP-only NIPPV ( b ) IPAP-only NIPPV follow standard , Bi-level , NIPPV ) . Subjects spend 6 week use first NIPPV set-up cross NIPPV treatment 6 week . At begin study , subject undergo approximately two hour train education respiratory therapist regard proper use Viasys® Healthcare , Pulmonetic Systems , lap-top ventilator ( LTV machine ) . They fit appropriate NIPPV set-up . The patient use mask interface study NIPPV machine use NIPPV ( bi-level positive airway pressure ( BiPAP ) ) machine prior study entry . The patient two additional study visit consent/training session : one end 6 week , first NIPPV treatment period ( prior cross second NIPPV treatment ) , second end 12 week , second NIPPV treatment period . NIPPV usage record hour use measure objectively NIPPV machine hour meter . When patient return his/her first study visit end week six , NIPPV machine hour meter record study investigator . By subtract hour record begin week two hour record end week six , NIPPV hour usage week two , three , four , five six obtain . This procedure repeat record NIPPV hour usage begin week eight end week twelve measure hour usage second NIPPV set-up week eight , nine , ten , eleven twelve . This allow study subject one week adjust new pressure setting treatment arm . Dyspnea measure transition dyspnea index ( TDI ) , quality life measure EuroQol Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) re-administered 6 12 week study visit study personnel . Lastly , patient preference NIPPV treatment subjectively assess 12 week study visit Likert scale ( definitely first treatment , probably first treatment , preference , probably second treatment , definitely second treatment ) .</detailed_description>
