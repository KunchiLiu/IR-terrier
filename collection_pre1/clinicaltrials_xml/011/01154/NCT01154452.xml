	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 ( RO4929097 ) give combination fixed-dose Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 ( GDC-0449 ) become recommend dose phase II portion study . ( Phase Ib ) II . To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) combination RO4929097 without GDC-0449 two arm patient advanced sarcoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe tolerability adverse event profile daily GDC-0449 administer orally combination daily RO4929097 administer orally 21 consecutive day . ( Phase Ib ) II . To describe pharmacokinetics combination combination GDC-0449 RO4929097 . ( Phase Ib ) III . To assess Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 overall response rate ( complete partial response [ CR+PR ] ) combination therapy . ( Phase Ib II ) IV . To conduct pharmacodynamic study tissue biopsy ( pre- post-study ) explorative hypothesis-generating study . ( Phase Ib II ) V. To assess overall survival . ( Phase II ) VI . To describe pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics combination GDC-0449 RO4929097 phase II dose continuous schedule . ( Phase II ) V. To conduct pharmacodynamic study tissue biopsy ( pre- post- study drug [ ] ) explorative hypothesis generate study . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study gamma-secretase/notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 follow phase II study . PHASE IB : PART A : Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . PART B : Beginning within 7 day finish part A , patient receive vismodegib PO gamma-secretase/notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive gamma-secretase/notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD day 1-21 . ARM II : Patients receive vismodegib PO gamma-secretase/notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD day 1-21 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
