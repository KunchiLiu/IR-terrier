The first aim examines acute effect two high-quality milk protein ( casein vs. whey ) whole-body muscle protein metabolism COPD patient severe loss muscle mass effect add leucine . The principal endpoint extent stimulation net whole body protein synthesis principal mechanism either amino acid protein intake cause muscle anabolism .

	<brief_title>Hydrolyzed Casein Whey Protein Supplementation Addition Leucine Induce Protein Anabolism Malnourished COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cachectic COPD patient characterize decreased muscle protein synthesis elevate myofibrillar protein breakdown . A substantial number patient , characterize enhanced systemic inflammatory response , fail respond nutritional therapy , clinical relevance weight gain nutritional therapy significant , independent predictor mortality COPD . In present study , acute protein anabolic effect two high-quality milk protein supplement COPD examine compare hydrolyze casein whey protein meal . We make use hydrolyzed protein correct absorption difference . Furthermore effect milk protein without enrichment leucine investigate . Variables interest : net whole body protein synthesis ; whole body protein synthesis breakdown rate ; whole body myofibrillar protein breakdown rate ; whole body collagen breakdown ; kinetics insulin ; glucose ; amino acid level . It investigators hypothesis nutritional supplement contain casein protein high level leucine target metabolic alteration cachectic COPD patient specifically stimulate protein anabolism . The knowledge gain study benefit insight term promotion protein anabolism COPD patient . The long-term goal reformulate nutritional composition accord effect COPD protein metabolism order ameliorate even prevent progressive muscle waste subject , improve quality life survival rate .</detailed_description>
