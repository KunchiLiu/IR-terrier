	<brief_title>Paclitaxel , Carboplatin Cetuximab ( PCC ) With Cetuximab , Docetaxel , Cisplatin Fluorouracil ( C-TPF ) Previously Untreated Patients With Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment study consist 2 part . The first part treatment call induction chemotherapy last 6-9 week , depend group . The second part treatment radiation therapy ( either without chemotherapy ) . The type treatment receive depend site stage disease . Study Drugs : Paclitaxel , carboplatin , 5-fluorouracil design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Docetaxel design stop growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . It may also damage blood vessel tumor tissue . Cisplatin platinum atom center . The platinum suppose poison cancer cell , may cause die . Cetuximab design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein inside cancer cell , call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . There equal chance assign either group . - If Group A , receive cetuximab , paclitaxel , carboplatin . - If Group B , receive cetuximab , docetaxel , cisplatin , 5-fluorouracil . Part 1 Study Drug Administration : Group A : During induction , receive cetuximab , paclitaxel , carboplatin vein week 6 week . During Week 1 , cetuximab infusion last 2 hour . During Weeks 2-6 , cetuximab infusion last 1 hour . Following cetuximab infusion , receive paclitaxel 1 hour follow carboplatin 1 hour . Your vital sign monitor , , cetuximab infusion . Group B : During induction , receive cetuximab , docetaxel , cisplatin vein . You also receive 5-fluorouracil non-stop infusion 4 day infusion pump . This pump portable treatment outpatient basis . On Day 1 21-day cycle : - You receive cetuximab 1-2 hour . - You receive docetaxel 1 hour . - You receive cisplatin 1-3 hour - You begin receive 5-fluorouracil . This infusion non-stop next 4 day . On Day 2 cycle , receive saline ( salt water ) prevent dehydration . On Days 5-10 cycle , take antibiotic , mouth , prevent infection . Your doctor tell type antibiotic take . On Day 8 cycle , receive cetuximab 1 hour . You 3 cycle induction therapy . Other drug may give receive study drug prevent side effect . You closely monitor side effect infusion clinic set allow leave . Part 1 Study Visits : Every week : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask drug may take . - You ask side effect may . After complete induction therapy , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET-CT check status disease . Part 2 Study Drug Administration : Before begin radiation , dental exam . You begin either radiation chemotherapy radiation without chemotherapy . Your doctor decide treatment best . All participant begin radiation 2-4 week induction therapy . You receive radiation Monday Friday 7 week , recommend treat radiologist . If receive radiation chemotherapy , receive carboplatin cisplatin every week receive radiation . If receive cisplatin , give vein 1-3 hour . If give carboplatin , give vein 1 hour . Part 2 Study Visits : Every week : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Your skin lining mouth check sore . Follow-Up Phase : About 6 week finish treatment : - You physical exam . - You chest x-ray . - You ask side effect may . - You ask drug take . - Your skin lining mouth check sore . If Group B , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan 6 week ( +/- 14 day ) complete radiation/chemoradiation check status disease . If Group A , CT scan , MRI scan , and/or PET/CT scan 9 week ( +/- 14 day ) complete radiation/chemoradiation check status disease . Six ( 6 ) , 12 , 24 month finish treatment , videofluoroscopic check swallow . You complete separate consent form procedure . You also complete questionnaire day-to-day activity . All participant clinic visit every 3 month 2 year . At visit : - You physical exam . - You chest x-ray . - You ask side effect may . - You ask drug take . - If doctor think need , additional tests/procedures perform . After Year 2 , follow do per standard care . You contact member study team phone letter ask received treatment cancer . Length Study : You remain treatment 15-16 week . If , time , disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . This investigational study . All study drug FDA approve commercially available . The combination drug give patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma investigational . Up 128 patient take part multicenter study . Up 100 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
