This `` wearing '' characterize return symptom ( i.e. , tremor , slowness , rigidity ) may occur course minute hour . When patient 's PD symptom return , patient say `` '' state . When patient take another dose medication , his/her PD symptom improve resolve , patient say `` '' state . Antagonism adenosine Type 2a receptor ( A2a ) may provide relief PD symptom .
