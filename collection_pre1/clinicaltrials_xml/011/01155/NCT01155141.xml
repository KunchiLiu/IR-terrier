	<brief_summary>FSGS immunologic disorder wherein circulate immune protein cause damage kidney progressive injury scar . Corticosteroid therapy occasionally , nearly universally , successful reduce proteinuria , patient respond , favorable prognosis . The investigator believe ACTH therapy ( H.P . Acthar Gel ) provide rapid , well tolerate reduction glomerular injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Idiopathic Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) Treatment With ACTH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT : Patients biopsy proven FSGS treat ACTH open-label pilot study tolerability efficacy . The investigator recruit 18-20 patient complete study , 2 year . ACTH therapy : Patients receive H.P . Acthar gel IM SQ , initially 40 IU SQ every week 16 week therapy . All patient treat goal BP &lt; 140/90mmHg patient treat ACEi ARB therapy tolerate . H2 receptor blockade proton pump inhibitor therapy also offer patient . Dose titrate 160 IU SQ every week , 1 month patient substantial reduction proteinuria , deterioration blood pressure development hyperglycemia well serious adverse event felt related medication . CLINICAL OUTCOME : Patients follow primary outcome remission proteinuria . This define partial remission proteinuria reduce 50 % initial , pre treatment value complete remission proteinuria reduce &lt; 0.5 g/g &lt; 500 mg/day 24 hour urine sample . Secondary outcome include effect eGFR , effect glucose level , effect blood pressure ( total dos antihypertensive medication absolute change blood pressure ) immune status . Outcomes determine look 3 month 6 month value urine protein eGFR follow initiation treatment . IMMUNOLOGIC TESTING : In order ass role immunologic perturations FSGS effect ACTH immune system , patient bank blood urine start study cytokine analysis , RNA , DNA , protein protoarray test . MONITORING AND SAFETY : All patient undergo full informed consent per Stanford Institutional Review Board . Contact number provide study staff available time case medical emergency . All patient continue routine health monitoring minimal monthly assessment . A comprehensive interview undertaken assess side effect , complete physical exam accomplish include vital sign , CBC , clinical chemistry ( include electrolyte , creatinine , glucose liver function test ) , urine protein creatinine fast lipid profile every 3 month . Also screen baseline . PATIENT WITHDRAWAL/TERMINATION OF STUDY : Patients closely monitor , detailed . Patients may voluntarily leave study time , although every effort make follow clinical course monitor safety issue possible benefit therapy . Patient monitor adverse event . Patients severe adverse event evaluate relatedness event study medication . If event consider severe possibly probably relate study medication , medication discontinue patient continue monitor . In case adverse event possibly relate , medication may restart , investigator subject agree . For patient probably relate severe adverse event , study treatment discontinue however , investigator still follow patient see course underlie disease modify treatment . As open label , pilot study , data safety monitor board felt necessary . If drug relate SAEs develop 20 % patient , study submit back IRB determine continue .</detailed_description>
