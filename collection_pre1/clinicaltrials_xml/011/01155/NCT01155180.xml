	<brief_summary>You invite take part research study role leptin ( fat cell hormone normally circulate blood ) maintaining reduce body weight . This study also evaluate leptin impact hormone level , metabolic rate ( many calorie use rest ) , autonomic nervous function ( part brain control heart rate breathing ) , change body composition sense appetite . Under normal condition , leptin secrete fat cell signal brain decrease appetite regulate energy usage hormone level . When obese individual lose weight , leptin level go , may cause later regain weight . This study provide leptin investigational medication ( yet approve Food Drug Administration ) increase level leptin hormone normally circulate blood back normal range . We see help maintain reduce body weight improve hormonal metabolic function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study leptin administration individual recent 10 % weight loss , achieve lifestyle intervention program . In study proposal , propose 90 subject recently complete lifestyle intervention weight loss program ( one four participate Boston Weight loss center ) achieve weight loss 10 % body weight enrol study . They baseline study perform ( include full neuroendocrine evaluation describe ) randomize leptin/placebo ratio 1:1 stratification center . They continue receive standard weight maintenance advice intermittent nutrition behavioral counseling . Our aim finally study total 36 subject per treatment arm ( 20 % drop inability achieve and/or maintain10 % weight loss expect ) . Leptin level check every month dose titrate achieve keep serum level equivalent baseline base baseline weight . We start leptin/placebo dose 0.08mg/kg fat mass men 0.14mg/kg fat mass woman , dose titration achieve baseline leptin level utilize formula derive pharmacokinetic study Leptin level check every month . Circulating leptin level +30 % -10 % baseline consider acceptable . Otherwise , leptin dose adjust accordingly . Our aim keep mean leptin level within +30 % baseline . Subjects study prior receiving leptin , four week six month weight maintenance compare change body weight composition , neuroendocrine function , metabolic function leptin placebo-treated group . In addition , first 23 subject per group measurement total energy expenditure perform use doubly label water baseline 6 month . This allow u examine effect leptin replacement , level observe baseline body weight , maintenance weight loss neuroendocrine metabolic adaptation decrease body weight obese individual . While difference weight maintenance six month primary outcome , subject also study 4 week weight maintenance , allow u determine role leptin adaptation weight loss stable , weight maintenance condition . We choose four week time point previous nonrandomized , uncontrolled study able document effect leptin replacement time . Both group follow extended 6-month period receive standard weight maintenance advice , addition leptin/placebo . We observe change weight , neuroendocrine function , metabolic function leptin signal time compare leptin placebo group . In subset 23 subject per group evaluate energy expenditure doubly label water . Finally , subject follow 6 month end study document change body weight additional study outcome .</detailed_description>
