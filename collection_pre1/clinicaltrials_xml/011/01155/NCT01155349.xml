	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) affect 1 million individual United States . In addition typical motor dysfunction , PD also affect cognition vision , even early stage disease , impair instrumental activity daily live drive . Reduced cognitive speed processing , bradyphrenia , strongly contribute cognitive decline PD . Recent research demonstrate intervention enhance cognitive speed processing , protect cognitive decline , improve everyday function relatively healthy , old adult . However , potential training technique enhance cognitive function among subpopulation different disease state , PD , thoroughly investigate . The propose study examine feasibility test efficacy well-established cognitive training tool among individual early stage PD diagnose dementia . A variety factor find influence cognitive performance among person PD may moderate ability benefit cognitive training age disease onset , disease duration , manifestation , severity , medication use well concomitant depression . These factor along demographic variable evaluate moderator train benefit . Baseline cognitive assessment complete among seventy-five individual PD randomize cognitive training treatment-delayed control condition . The efficacy train immediately enhance cognitive functioning evaluate post-training ( equivalent delay ) assessment . Disease demographic factor may impact efficacy cognitive training person PD examine relation training gain . Considering cognitive function among individual PD strong predictor everyday functioning subsequent need long term care , enhance cognitive function individual PD training great potential prolong person ' productivity , independence , quality life . The information gain study useful identifying individual PD likely benefit cognitive training well development , refinement , implementation appropriate cognitive intervention population .</detailed_description>

Subjects random severe motor fluctuation dyskinesias exclude . Further inclusion criterion diagnosis dementia evidence severe dementia may limit ability benefit training , adequate visual acuity view test training stimulus ( far visual acuity &gt; = 20/80 ) .</criteria>
