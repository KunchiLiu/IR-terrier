	<brief_summary>Introduction : With rapid development technology telemedicine become tool potential improve optimize treatment different disease make diagnostics , treatment counsel possible shorter long distance . Home base telemedicine new method lead series important question need answer . This study design answer question concern patient safety telehomecare , patients´ quality life , efficiency cost benefit analysis implement technology . This study patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) admit hospital acute exacerbation . Approximately 24 hour admission half patient randomize admitted home support telemedical equipment half remain admitted hospital ( typically 5-7 day ) . Primary Aim : To investigate telemedical surveillance treatment recovery period acute exacerbation safe conventional admission patient COPD measure treatment failure . Secondary Aims : To evaluate telemedical surveillance treatment recovery period acute exacerbation compare conventional treatment COPD : 1 . Is comparable reestablish Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) . 2 . Demands number treatment days/time discharge/cessation telemedical surveillance . 3 . Is comparable quality life two group treat patient . 4 . Have comparable adverse event profile . 5. lead low total cost health service ( health economical analysis ) 6 . Is possible patient ( drop-outs technical equipment patient know use equipment . ) 7 Is well see physician 's perspective come : 1 . The virtual patient contact / communication 2 . Technology 3 . The work process compare conventional work process 4 . Time spent patient 5 . Usability 6 . Improvement potential ( `` doctor view '' ) 8 . The equipment satisfactory patient use Method For study telemedical platform develop possible treat patient home . The platform consist videoconference part allow patient make contact qualified medical staff technology part transfer vital indicator patients´ health condition ( lung function , oxygen saturation , pulse etc . ) 175 patient include expect drop-out 20 % 35 patient . The patient equally recruit two hospital ( Frederiksberg Herlev Hospital ) . All patient must exacerbation COPD require hospitalization include study . Each patient participate study 6 month discharge follow-up 1 , 3 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In addition main study , two sub study conduct , use intervention subject main study ; 1 . COPD patients´ self-efficacy virtual admission compare hospital admission - implication clinical practice 2 . Cognitive function daily life virtual admission compare conventional hospital admission patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) Ad . 1 : COPD patients´ self-efficacy virtual admission compare hospital admission - implication clinical practice Background : In order transfer patient hospital telemedicine base homecare treatment regimen , patient must able perform test treatment also contribute identification problem change physical condition . However , far investigated whether patient use telehomecare acquire necessary skill cope problem entail COPD , interaction healthcare professional relative . Aim : The primary aim sub study describe characterize COPD patients´ self-efficacy virtual admission compare hospital admission . Method : Self-efficacy measure use `` The COPD self-efficacy scale '' , develop Wigal et al ( Chest 1991 ) . The mean score compare two study arm , furthermore change within two group assess . Data collect baseline , also three day , six week three month discharge . In addition , analysis conduct explore association self-efficacy , readmission use bed day three month follow-up period . Ad.2 : Cognitive function daily life virtual admission compare conventional hospital admission patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) Background : COPD affect distant organ cause several complication , include cognitive dysfunction . The impairment form significant clinical problem consequence patient dependency help basic daily activity , increase symptom experience poor compliance medical treatment . Aim : The aim study investigate cognitive function daily life virtual admission compare conventional hospital admission patient COPD . The study part randomize multicenter trial , investigate feasibility safety telemedicine base treatment regime COPD patient , compare conventional hospital treatment ( Telemedicine technology make possible communicate patient use video conference system connect telemedicine communication platform ) . Method : For sub study , consecutively include 150 patient multicenter trial . The primary outcome cognitive function evaluate neuropsychological test battery ( ISPOCD ) , include verbal learning , memory capacity attention , discharge , six week discharge . The secondary outcome daily life evaluate questionnaire include self-reported cognitive function , self-efficacy , activity daily live , health relate quality life , anxiety depression , discharge , six week three month discharge .</detailed_description>
