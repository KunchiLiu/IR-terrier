	<brief_summary>The study design test follow hypothesis : In obese patient OSAS , benefit combination exercise training + continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) high CPAP alone term functional capacity , metabolic , inflammatory , cardiovascular sleep parameter quality life . In obese patient OSAS , benefit training use ventilatory assistance ( NIV ) cycloergometer [ cycloergometer NIV ] respiratory muscle train ( spirotiger ) addition cycloergometer [ cycloergometer + spirotiger ] high cycloergometer train alone [ cycloergometer ] term functional exercise capacity . Dyspnea walk test respiratory muscle strength baseline could influence response combine exercise training [ cycloergometer + NIV ] [ cycloergometer + spirotiger ]</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>OBese Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) EXercise Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity sleep apnea syndrome lead metabolic trouble increase cardiovascular risk . Furthermore , diseases associate reduced exercise tolerance . We hypothesize exercise training could complementary nocturnal ventilatory treatment restore metabolic disturbance , exercise tolerance sleep parameter obese patient SAS . Objective : To evaluate effect training exercise tolerance ( walk distance dyspnea walk ) ( main objective ) , systemic inflammation , vascular endothelial function , insulin resistance , quality sleep quality life obese patient treat CPAP OSAS ( secondary objective ) Methods : We propose conduct control , randomize clinical trial compare efficacy 3 different modality train obese patient SAS . After 6-week control pre-inclusion period , patient include either [ cycloergometer ] vs. [ cycloergometer ventilatory assistance ] vs. [ cycloergometer + respiratory muscle exercise ] . Before control period , immediately 9 month training , patient perform walk test , maximal incremental test cycloergometer , blood sample cardiovascular function , body composition , muscle function , quality sleep quality life assessment well spontaneous physical activity measurement . During 5 year follow inclusion train program , number cardiovascular event record every year . An interim analysis carry 30 complete third evaluation session ( train program ) . The Peto 's method use correct p-values .</detailed_description>
