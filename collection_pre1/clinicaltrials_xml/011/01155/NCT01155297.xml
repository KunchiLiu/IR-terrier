	<brief_summary>Introduction : Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) consider important public health problem , prevalence 9.6 % population . The CKD main symptom fatigue , muscle weakness poor exercise tolerance , directly contribute physical inactivity low mobility , increase risk morbidity mortality CKD patient significant impact quality life patient . Thus , patient CKD poor quality life , high incidence cardiovascular disease , high prevalence endothelial dysfunction , consequent increase arterial stiffness serum concentration asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) . It believe condition patient may reduce cardiovascular risk improve quality life . Aim study : Evaluate impact exercise training relation functional capacity , quality life , pulse wave velocity ADMA patient CKD dialysis . Materials method : Is randomize controlled study , 34 CKD patient conservative treatment , divide control group ( stretch exercise metabolic exercise ) train group , undergo physical training , aerobic resistance six month . Before exercise training , patient assess use SF-36 IPAQ . Also hold assessment pulse wave velocity , measurement serum ADMA spirometry test . Statistical analysis consist test independent data chi-square appropriate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CKD currently regard important worldwide public health problem . In United States , approximately 10.8 % population disease ( Sarnak et al 2003 ) estimate 2015 40 million people country develop chronic renal failure ( BRONAS , 2009 ) . In Brazil , epidemiological data rare , study prevalence 9.6 % population ( Bastos et al , 2009 ) . The skeletal muscle patient CKD may present structural alteration degeneration muscle fiber , contribute reduction strength endurance . The use steroid medication , malnutrition , hormonal electrolyte abnormality also element ( CHAN , CHEEMA , SINGH , 2007 ) . These symptom directly contribute physical inactivity low mobility , increase risk morbidity mortality patient CKD ( MANSUR LIMA ; NOVAES , 2007 ) . To measure quality life CKD patient need identify dimension patient 's life affect , investigation SF 36 widely use ( CATTAI et al , 2007 ) . The SF-36 ass quality life individual analysis physical , social , emotional mental health . ( Castro et al , 2003 ) . There numerous way assess functional capacity , cardiopulmonary exercise test ( ET ) , valuable method . Involves assessment respiratory , metabolic cardiovascular variable measurement pulmonary gas exchange exercise expression functional assessment index ( SIERRA , 1997 ; Yasbek JR , 1998 ) . The functional capacity aerobic capacity determine obtain content maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2 max ) ventilatory anaerobic threshold ( BARROS NETO ; Tebexreni ; TAMBEIRO , 2001 ) . Several study bounce importance physical activity indicate benefit bring patient CKD dialysis . Smith colleague ( 2007 ) submit dialysis patient exercise protocol , consist heating , stretch active resistance exercise conduct 24 session . They observe significant improvement blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) , well improve quality life assess use SF-36 . Patients CKD high prevalence cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) include coronary dysfunction , peripheral vascular dysfunction heart failure ( CANZIANI , 2004 ) . The CVD represent lead cause death patient early stage CKD , rate approximately 45 % patient dialysis ( Abedin et al , 2010 ) . Recent study show marker arterial stiffness important predictor mortality morbidity relate CVD CKD patient ( MOLLER et al , 2007 ) . The arterial stiffening hallmark age process , due change wall structure artery consequent remodel process accelerate metabolic disturbance arise CKD ( Frimodt-MOLLER et al , 2008 ; PORAZKO et al , 2009 ) . The pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) valid instrument ass arterial distensibility , recognize gold standard measure arterial stiffness , good reproducibility , noninvasive easy perform ( Di Iorio et al , 2009 ) . Mustata et al ( 2004 ) study evaluate arterial stiffness insulin resistance dialysis patient , aim measure impact aerobic training variable obtain response significant decrease value arterial stiffness training . Toussaint et al ( 2008 ) conduct prospective study impact cycle dialysis arterial stiffness patient CKD find significant improvement physical training compare exercise . With study author speculate improvement arterial compliance relate enhance NO bioavailability serum . The result study promise suggest exercise training improve arterial compliance reduces leave ventricular hypertrophy patient CKD . Clearly , research need area confirm finding patient CKD . Abedin et al ( 2010 ) analyze data control study , find high prevalence vascular calcification arterial stiffness pre-dialysis patient , show positive relationship progression CKD CVD . The CKD generalize vasculopathy , mention accompany endothelial dysfunction ( COSTA-HONG et al , 2009 ) . One cause endothelial dysfunction inhibition nitric oxide ( NO ) , important vasodilator potent factor oppose atherogenesis . This inhibition occur , among cause , increase serum concentration substance asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) present mainly CVD CKD ( Mittermayer et al , 2005 ) . Oner - Iyidogan et al ( 2009 ) show close relationship increase value ADMA CKD , justify lack excretion substance . In another study , Gibson et al ( 2008 ) analyze patient metabolic syndrome find low endogenous NO formation high concentration circulate ADMA . The patient CKD generally along disease develops insulin resistance , CHF high concentration ADMA ( ONER-IYIDOGAN et al , 2009 ) . However knowledge study evaluate effect physical exercise value ADMA serum group . The work knowledge evaluate impact physical training patient pre-dialysis , write Boyce et al ( 1997 ) , examine variable renal function , blood pressure cardiorespiratory endurance . They conclude exercise training reduces blood pressure , increase aerobic capacity muscle strength . Moinuddin Leehey ( 2008 ) report aerobic exercise muscle training great benefit CKD patient , improve VO2max muscle mass . Chan , &amp; Singh Cheema ( 2007 ) , undergo 12 week high intensity exercise progressive resistance training hemodialysis routine , obtain result increase muscle mass strength subsequent improvement quality life patient . Given importance topic fact appropriate therapeutic slow progression dysfunction , reduce suffer patient reduce cost national health system , see need study implementation physical rehabilitation patient CKD undergoing hemodialysis . Therefore , study aim evaluate impact exercise training relation functional capacity , quality life , pulse wave velocity ADMA patient CKD conservative treatment . This project randomize control study develop Clinic Hospital , School Medicine Botucatu . The work approve Ethics Research committee start inform formal consent patient . The data collection begin assessment quality life use SF-36 validated Brazil ; application short version IPAQ Questionnaire identify sedentary patient , evaluation PWV functional capacity spirometry test ( brand Cosmed K4b2 , Rome , Italy ) . This study use lab test already part routine department monitoring patient CKD , The Brazilian Guidelines Chronic Kidney Disease recommend . Simultaneously collect venous blood sample measurement serum ADMA . The result record submitted statistical analysis . The baseline characteristic group compare test independent data chi-square appropriate . The behavior group analyze test dependent sample .</detailed_description>
