	<brief_title>The Effects Lovaza® Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cause 19 million death US annually coronary artery disease accounting mortality burden.1 Despite major advance treatment coronary heart disease patient , large number victim disease apparently healthy die suddenly without prior symptom . For arrive alive emergency department , benefit accrue orchestrated program live-saving therapeutic design preserve ischemic infarcted myocardium prevent ventricular arrhythmia . However , despite improvement door-to-balloon ( angioplasty ) time past decade , reduction in-hospital mortality materialized.2 Average 30-day mortality ST elevation MI show approximately 7 % despite modern aggressive approach utilize acute pharmacologic percutaneous intervention well comprehensive approach risk factor modification.3 Antiplatelet agent include aspirin , clopidogrel , heparin , IIb/IIIa inhibitor represent stalwart component acute coronary syndrome therapeutic treatment program . At time , safety combination antiplatelet agent use acutely chronically individual acute coronary syndrome concern bleed complication result serious , life-threatening consequences.4 Studies show patient treated combination aspirin clopidogrel small significant increase risk major minor bleeding compare agent alone.4-6 In contrast , use fish oil conjunction aspirin clopidogrel patient cardiovascular disease follow average 33 month show significant effect risk major minor bleeding compare aspirin clopidogrel alone , trend toward reduce risk minor bleed take fish oil.4 In Preliminary Data show robust synergistic effect Lovaza® aspirin downregulation platelet function may occur . These data suggest potent omega-3 fatty acid find fish oil ( eicosapentaenoic acid { EPA } docosahexaenoic acid { DHA } ) act acutely modulate major contributor pathophysiology acute coronary syndrome . This study randomize 60 patient ST elevation myocardial infarction treatment Lovaza® placebo measure difference platelet function electrophysiologic parameter treatment arm acute hospitalization 1 week discharge .</detailed_description>
