	<detailed_description>Sanfilippo syndrome , Mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) III , rare lysosomal storage disease ( LSD ) cause loss activity 1 4 enzyme necessary degradation glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) heparan sulfate ( HS ) lysosomes . MPS IIIA result deficiency enzyme heparan N-sulfatase ( sulfamidase ) . In absence enzyme , intermediate HS degradation process accumulate lysosome neuron glial cell , less accumulation outside brain . MPS IIIA symptom arise average 7 month age , average age diagnosis 4.5 year majority patient . Patients present wide spectrum severity clinical symptom . The central nervous system ( CNS ) severely affect organ system patient MPS IIIA , evidence deficit language development , motor skill , intellectual development . In addition , abnormal behavior include limited aggression excess motor activity/hyperactivity contribute disturbance sleep.Overall , individual MPS IIIA mark developmental delay significantly reduce lifespan 15 year age average . No effective , disease-modifying therapy currently approve treatment devastate disable disease . Shire Human Genetic Therapies ( Shire HGT ) develop sulfamidase enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) rhHNS patient MPS IIIA . rhHNS administer cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) via surgically implanted intrathecal drug delivery device ( IDDD ) , administer intravenously ( IV ) cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . This study multicenter , multiple-dose , dose escalation study design evaluate safety , tolerability , clinical activity 3 dose level ( 10mg,45mg 90mg monthly 6 month ) rhHNS administer via IDDD patient Sanfilippo syndrome Type A age great equal 3 year age . Patients complete study requirement study invited participate open-label extension study design evaluate long term safety clinical outcome intrathecal administration rhHNS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient must meet follow criterion enrol study : A documented deficiency sulfamidase enzyme activity great equal 10 % low limit normal range AND either normal enzyme activity level least 1 sulfatase 2 documented mutation â€¢At least 3 year age developmental age 1 year Patients must medically stable , opinion Investigator , accommodate protocol requirement , include travel , assessment , IDDD surgery , without place undue burden patient/patient 's family . The patient 's parent ( ) legal guardian must voluntarily sign Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committeeapproved inform consent form . Patients meet follow criterion exclude study : Significant nonMPS IIIA related central nervous system ( CNS ) impairment behavioral disturbance would confound scientific integrity interpretation study assessment MPS IIIA behavioralrelated issue , determine Investigator , would preclude performance study neurocognitive developmental testing procedure . Patient pregnant , breast feeding , female patient childbearing potential comply use acceptable method birth control The patient blind and/or deaf . The patient know suspected hypersensitivity anesthesia think unacceptably high risk anesthesia due airway compromise condition . The patient patient 's family history neuroleptic malignant syndrome , malignant hyperthermia , anesthesiarelated concern . Complications result prior lumbar puncture . CNS shunt Skeletomuscular/spinal abnormality contraindication surgical implantation IDDD . History poorly control seizure disorder . Patient currently receive psychotropic medication The patient sustain absence aspirin , nonsteroidal medication , medication affect blood clotting within 1 week prior relevant studyrelated procedure ingest medication within 1 week procedure change clot activity would deleterious . The patient receive treatment investigational drug device intend treatment MPS IIIA within 30 day prior , study , currently enrol another study involve investigational drug device ( screen safety followup contact ) . The patient receive hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow transplant . The patient 's parent ( ) , patient 's legal guardian ( ) is/are unable provide consent patient provide assent</criteria>
