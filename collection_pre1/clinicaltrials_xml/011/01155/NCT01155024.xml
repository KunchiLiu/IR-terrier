	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Direct Manufactured Prosthetic Sockets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many member Armed Forces civilian need prosthetic device due amputation result gunshot , bombing , vehicular accident , trauma . As number amputee increase high rate , limited number certify prosthetist find harder satisfy patient demand . Therefore , overall goal provide Orthopedic &amp; Prosthetic ( O &amp; P ) industry tool accommodate increase prosthetist patient ratio still provide acceptable product quality . The practice create prosthetic socket plaster-casting amputee ' residual limb around decade continue commonly use method shape capture , modification fabrication prosthetic socket . Using traditional plaster-casting approach many limitation overcome use technology . With advance development Computer Aided Design ( CAD ) Computer Aided Manufacturing ( CAM ) technology past ten year , possible completely replace plaster-casting approach handheld , portable scanner . While current CAD/CAM approach certainly create substantial efficiency clinical aspect create prosthetic socket , actual manufacturing prosthetic device continue rely use positive model lengthy manual fabrication process . The continue development direct manufacturing technology may serve final piece effective utilization CAD/CAM care prosthetic orthotic patient . Direct manufacturing provide mean quantify alteration accurately reproduce prosthetic socket . Additionally , direct manufacture potential reduce time , cost , waste , result improve quality care ability patient . This study compare two fabrication technique diagnostic definitive socket : manually fabricate ( positive model technique ) direct manufacture ( experimental ) .</detailed_description>
