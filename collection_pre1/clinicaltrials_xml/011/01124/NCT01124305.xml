	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine whether surgical time require primary total knee arthroplasty significantly less performed Customized Patient Instrumentation ( CPI ) conventional instrumentation . Each case record video camera , order time length surgery surgical step . The number surgical tray require case record . As additional endpoint , investigator measure limb component alignment x-rays determine two method achieve equivalent alignment result . The thickness bone cut compare surgical plan . The primary hypothesis use customize patient instrumentation reduce operative time require total knee arthroplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Knee Arthroplasty Performed With Conventional Customized Instrumentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient-specific instrumentation ( PSI ) develop total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) several potential advantage traditional instrumentation ( TI ) . Shortened surgical time , few surgical instrument , improve alignment propose advantage . We seek examine assertion . 52 patient ( 26 per group ) enrol prospective , randomized trial compare CT-based PSI TI . No difference see average patient age ( 68 year ) BMI ( 31 ) group ( p=0.84 p=0.89 ) , although male PSI group ( 14 v 7 , p=0.002 ) . A single surgeon consistent staff perform surgery knee prosthesis , case videotape measure length surgery individual step . Any additional bone cut , size change , ligament release make achieve correct alignment balance document . The number instrument tray open case record . Postoperative long alignment lateral radiograph take measure coronal sagittal plane component alignment mechanical axis patient .</detailed_description>
