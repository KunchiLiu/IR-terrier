	<detailed_description>Introduction Barrett 's oesophagus common complication patient suffer gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . By mean chronic acid exposure squamous epithelium oesophagus turn specialise columnar epithelium ( SCE ) goblet cell . This histological change prevalent 1 % normal population , 4 , 9 % patient reflux symptom [ 1 ] . Although Barrett 's epithelium necessarily cause additional symptom , presence diagnose accurately , since affected patient increase risk 0.5 % per year develop Barrett 's associated cancer . An important prognostic factor make grade dysplasia within Barrett 's mucosa . While patient dysplasia low-grade dysplasia remain clinically inconspicuous , annual risk develop cancer 10 % patient high-grade dysplasia . If Barrett 's associate neoplastic lesion find endoscopy , Barrett 's associated cancer also present another site Barrett 's oesophagus 30 % [ 2 ] . Consequently , undergo periodically screen , consist endoscopy oesophagus 4-quadrant biopsy every 2 3 cm , case HGIN , local ablative therapy . The time period control depend grade dysplasia diagnose upper gastrointestinal endoscopy . If dysplasia present , recommend follow-up period less 5 year . In case low grade dysplasia endoscopic control perform every year . Patients high grade dysplasia examine every 3 month prepare therapeutic intervention [ 3 ] . Early detection Barrett 's associated neoplasm , histologically classified adenocarcinoma , important therapeutic implication . Cancerous infiltration submucosal structure associate significant risk lymph node metastases therefore treated surgery . However , oesophagectomy show suffer mortality rate 3 12 % , apart substantial short- long-term morbidity . Hence essential detect early neoplastic lesion broader range therapeutic option disposal . Patients high grade intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGIN ) mucosal cancer perfect candidate curative endoscopic intervention like endoscopic ablation ( radiofrequency , example ) , endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) . The latter technique prefer resect specimen evaluate histologically , provide definite information invasion depth whether resection border free neoplastic tissue . Because high rate newly occur neoplasia , remain area Barrett 's mucosa ablate resected histological confirmation Barrett 's oesophagus associate neoplasia [ 3 , 4 ] . Trying improve diagnostic yield surveillance patient high risk Barrett 's oesophagus associate neoplasia , many new endoscopic invention introduce management Barrett 's oesophagus order optimize detection rate early lesion . Among development improve image quality conventional white light endoscope like high-resolution high-definition endoscope . Another approach , call chromoendoscopy , use vivo stain methylene blue , indigo carmine acetic acid . These dye help increase tissue contrast lead improvement detection rate comparable high-resolution endoscopy . High contrast level without stain agent achieve use narrow band imaging ( NBI ) . This technology additionally improve visibility capillary , vein subtle tissue structure use light wavelength restrict small band blue green spectrum . In prospective randomize crossover study show equal result high-resolution endoscopy plus indigo carmine [ 4 , 5 ] . The new development introduce endoscopic management gastrointestinal tract call confocal laser endomicroscope ( CLE ) . Confocal microscopy develop Marvin Minsky late 1950s . Its principle microscopic scan focal point surface object . In comparison conventional light microscopy use special filter system avoid image overlap surround tissue . In detail , light source ( normally laser ) focus microscope objective lens diffraction limit spot inside object . Light scatter , fluorescence excite ( achieve fluorescein stain , example ) emit , focus sample partially return back optic along path arrive . A beam-splitter place path reflect return light towards detector . The optics focus light focal point specimen conjugate focus near detector ( hence technology term `` con-focal '' ) . Here spatial filter ( `` pinhole '' ) use extinguish light derive area outside focal point . Light reflection focal point forward detector connect computer system digitalise optical signal creates vivo histological image [ 6 ] . Focussing clinical impact , confocal microscopy first technique allow vivo evaluation tissue structure beneath surface . Because many breakthrough miniaturisation ( mostly 1990s ) technology could apply intraluminal use gastroenterology , integrate otherwise standard endoscope . It allow vivo histological visualisation upper 250 micrometer wall within gastrointestinal tract , additionally normal function white light endoscopy ( provide two separate screen top workstation ) [ 6 ] . Using CLE first clinical approach , Kiesslich et al . find high sensitivity specificity rate detection Barrett 's oesophagus well prediction Barrett 's associate neoplastic change - result CLE derive picture compare conventional histology [ 7 ] . In first prospective , randomize , double-blind , control , crossover trial Dunbar et al . proved finding , CLE-targeted biopsy higher diagnostic yield Barrett 's oesophagus associate neoplasia standard endoscopy 4-quadrant random biopsy [ 8 ] . Study Aims In clinical investigation want use confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ) accurately target Barrett 's oesophagus associate neoplasia subsequent endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) . To knowledge combination document one case report far , describe successful resection high-grade dysplastic Barrett-segment use CLE-targeted EMR [ 9 ] . We want show CLE suitable detect exact border high grade intraepithelial neoplasia . In experience feasibility reliably provide establish technique like chromoendoscopy narrow band imaging , often cause need re-treatment even surgery . To guarantee accurate documentation mucosal CLE-mapping , dimension neoplastic lesion mark term colour , photograph simultaneously available white light endoscopy finally evaluate histological assessment specimen . Analysing border resect specimen concern tumour infiltration able calculate en-bloc resection rate CLE-targeted EMR . In order evaluate CLE concern true negative result resect remain mucosal area affect Barrett within second phase examination ( lesion big one-time resection ) within second examination . Once , CLE apply lesion search malignancy . If CLE detect area neoplasia , CLE-mapping mention perform . All resect tissue part evaluate histologically check result CLE . If CLE provide reliable data investigation would big step way establish new technology within pre-interventional endoscopic management patient suffer Barrett 's oesophagus . This could help increase en-bloc resection rate , decrease amount repetitive resection consequentially improve patient comfort . Study Design Prospective clinical trial without randomisation blinding Study Population Patients refer department endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) Barrett 's mucosa high grade intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGIN ) detect routine upper endoscopy Barrett 's surveillance endoscopy department another hospital . Exclusion criterion : - patient allergic one drug component ( include drug use conscious sedation like propofol midazolam well fluorescein , fluorescent dye use CLE ) - patient present contraindication EMR ( low platelet count , therapeutic anticoagulation , coagulation disorder ) - refusal participate study Methods Our investigation perform Medical University Vienna , department medicine III , clinical division gastroenterology hepatology . Patient recruitment start 1st July 2010 . The study last two year . The number patient include within period 40 , base current number EMR perform department Barrett 's intraepithelial neoplasia . All patient fulfil list inclusion criterion , receive patient information form study together usual informed consent form respective endoscopic examination undergo . Patient information do least 24 hr . intervention , practise unit . If patient agrees participate study prepared endoscopy confocal laser endomicroscope ( Pentax EC3870K ISC-1000 confocal endomicroscopy processor - Pentax , Tokyo , Japan Optiscan Pty Ltd , Notting Hill , Victoria , Australia ) administration intravenous propofol and/or midazolam routinely use conscious sedation endoscopic procedure department . Additionally , 5-10 ml 10 % solution fluorescein sodium administer intravenously enhance tissue fluorescence endomicroscopy . All drug administer medical specialist ( project director ) , assistant doctor ( project assistant ) register nurse , routinely practised institution . Ethical implication Confocal laser endomicroscopy safe new technique already study clinical trial [ 7 , 8 ] . Its safety guarantee use low intensity laser light bad cause local bleaching fluorescein contain cell , harmless , reversible even use diagnostic sign experimental condition [ 6 ] . Endoscopic mucosal resection well establish technique minimal invasive , non-surgical curative treatment intramucosal neoplasia . It study many clinical trial routinely perform unit lesion oesoophagus , stomach , duodenum colo-rectum . Although severe complication like prolonged bleeding perforation potentially occur , risk/benefit profile procedure good , compare surgical treatment neoplastic disease oesophagus [ 10 ] . This study protocol submit ethic commission Medical University Vienna ( EK-Nr . 697/2009 ) handle meet 8th September 2009 . A positive vote already deliver institution write form .</detailed_description>
