	<brief_summary>The goal study create comprehensive database Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) pathology patient brain tumor . Both standard , advanced , research MRI component may include , analyze comparison pathology result if/when biopsy obtain , also use predict/evaluate response therapy . This study create database de-identified MRI image include technique brain tumor study time ( longitudinally ) organize manner .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glioblastoma ( GBM ) common primary malignant neoplasm adult brain . Even multimodal therapy , treatment outcome remain poor , median survival approximately one year . A central challenge facing investigator modern era resolve heterogeneity inherent GBM pathology use technology identify individual genetic molecular marker indicate treatment individualize improve outcome emphasis use heterogeneity improve patient care . With advance image potential genetic sequence analysis , increasingly clinicians researcher focus specific clinical , image , genetic biomarkers allow personalization brain tumor treatment attempt improve limitation face extend patient survival devastate disease . Specific methodology develop allow genetic microarray analysis patient 's tumor tissue , type research ongoing one participating institution , Swedish Medical Center . In addition , center Washington University School Medicine St. Louis , Missouri extensive experience pursue advance image biomarkers application clinical neuro-oncology research . Of importance , however , although clinician researcher come recognize in-vivo image technology may much relevance genetic biomarkers personalization brain tumor treatment , clinical trial attempt validate biomarkers correlate particular outcome limited lack technology infrastructure would allow multi-site image acquisition , processing , data analysis , subsequent correlation clinical genetic data , ultimately share anonymized data researcher central archive site . BIRN infrastructure integrate neuroimaging , genetic microarray , clinical data focus integrate image biomarkers prospective clinical research patient malignant brain tumor . In project , consortium neuro-oncology research center federate obtain unified set clinical , genetic , image data . In initial phase , 100 patient malignant brain tumor two participate site study . Our ultimate goal use develop protocol informatics infrastructure expand consortium include large number neuro-oncology clinical site suitable execute large scale clinical trial facilitate generation data identify image biomarkers relevant personalization brain tumor treatment ultimately improvement outcomes patient devastate disease .</detailed_description>
