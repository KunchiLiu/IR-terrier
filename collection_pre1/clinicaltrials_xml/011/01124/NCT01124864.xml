	<brief_summary>This study ass efficacy AUY922 , administer weekly 70 mg/m2 , adult patient advance Non-small-cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) , receive least two prior line chemotherapy . Patients retrospectively , prospectively , stratify base molecular tumor etiology . The following stratum assign : Patients Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activate mutation , Patients Kirstin Raus sarcoma virus ( KRAS ) activate mutation , Patients EML4-ALK ( anaplastic lymphoma kinase ) translocation patient EGFR Kras wild type .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm advanced ( stage IIIB stage IV ) NSCLC receive least two prior line treatment . Patients , investigator opinion , deem unsuitable standard 2nd line chemotherapy eligible protocol participation . One prior line must include platinum agent . Prior treatment platinum agent requirement EGFR mutant patient patient EML4ALK translocation Patients enrol fifth stratum , modify EGFR mutant , must document prior response EGFR TKI define CR , PR SD 6 month great unless patient de novo resistance EGFR TKI ( e.g . exon 20 insertion . ) All patient must least one measurable lesion define RECIST criterion . Previously irradiated lesion measurable unless lesion new demonstrate clear progression radiation World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status ≤ 2 . For patient enrolled fifth stratum , modify EGFR mutant , World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status ≤ 1 Patients enrol fifth stratum , modify EGFR mutant , must willing suitable undergo fresh baseline biopsy prior study treatment ( unless patient recent biopsy EGFR TKI progression conclude resistance EGFR TKI . ) Hematologic : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dl . Platelets ( plt ) ≥ 100 x 109/L . Biochemistry : Total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) within normal limit correctable supplement . Magnesium within low normal limit correctable supplement . Adequate liver function define : AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT ≤ 3.0 x Upper limit Normal ( ULN ) ≤ 5.0 x ULN liver metastasis present . Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Serum albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dL . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 24 hour clearance ≥ 50 mL/min . Patients receive four line prior treatment . Exception : Patients enrol fifth stratum , modify EGFR mutant , must receive two prior line therapy . Chemotherapy administer adjuvant treatment six month prior study enrollment consider prior line therapy purpose study . Patients history CNS metastasis . Note : Patients without clinical sign symptom CNS involvement require MRI brain . Exception : Patients treat brain metastasis asymptomatic , discontinued corticosteroid , clinically stable one month eligible protocol participation . This exception valid patient enrol fifth stratum , modify EGFR mutant . These patient must CNS involvement . Prior antineoplastic treatment HSP90 HDAC inhibitor compound . Patients must receive : systemic anticancer treatment radiotherapy within 4 week prior first dose study treatment recover baseline less Grade 1 toxicity therapy prior first dose study treatment 2 week palliative radiotherapy bone , 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin 4 week monoclonal antibody ≤5 halflife agent active metabolite [ ] continuous systemic anticancer treatment investigational Patients either archival tumor sample available unwilling fresh tumor sample collect baseline . Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
