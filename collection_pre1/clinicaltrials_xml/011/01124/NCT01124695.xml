	<brief_title>Tamoxifen Citrate Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To correlate CYP2D6 score ( 0 vs 1-2 ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic breast cancer treat tamoxifen citrate . Secondary - To correlate CYP2D6 score ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) PFS patient treat regimen . - To correlate CYP2D6 score ( 0 vs 1 + 2 ) proportion patient PFS 6 month . - To correlate endoxifen concentration response patient treat regimen . - To correlate CYP2D6 response patient treat regimen . - To correlate presence candidate estrogen receptor ( ESR ) 1 2 variant allele , UGT7 , SULT1A1 , candidate gene PFS . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood , plasma , tissue sample collect periodically laboratory study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
