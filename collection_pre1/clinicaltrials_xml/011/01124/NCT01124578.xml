	<brief_summary>PURPOSE OF EVALUATION : This study verify &amp; validate acceptability Egret 's extend use product compare existing daily change-out product . Based extensive in-vitro study , Egret 's product confirm significant kill positive negative gram bacteria . In addition meeting current product requirement , total aerobic bio-burden catheter test various interval 10 day use . The current used product use control group change daily per current policy . The control group test total aerobic bacteria count last day use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol Title : Extended Use In-line Endotracheal Suction Catheter w/BIOSAFE Protocol Number : RT 2008-001 Study Director : Richard C. Dowdy Study Director 's Address Method Contact : Egret Medical Products Inc. Richard C. Dowdy 2713 Industrial Lane Garland , TX 75041 ( 214 ) 291-0238 Phone ( 817 ) 991-7459 Cell ( 214 ) 291-0243 Fax rdowdy @ egretmedical.com I . PURPOSE OF EVALUATION : This test verify &amp; validate acceptability Egret 's extend use product compare exist Ballard 's daily change-out product . In addition meeting current product requirement , total aerobic bio-burden catheter test various interval 10 day use . II . BACKGROUND : Prior evaluation , baseline study conduct Medical City determine exist total aerobic bio-burden one day use , use 25 randomly select Ballard catheter per attach protocol . The data baseline study use establish appropriate sample size Extended Use Protocol . This data gather Extended Use Protocol compare baseline data determine effectiveness Egret 's antimicrobial property extend use . III . POTENTIAL RISK TO PATIENT : Closed endotracheal suction catheter intend maintain hermetical seal . However , catheter propensity build bio- film tip area require saline rinse cleaning use . Egret 's catheter compound non-leaching antimicrobial address issue . There possibility excessive patient secretion saturate closed suction catheter . Egret address concern incorporate unique squeegee-and-filter design facilitate tip clean prevents debris migrate clean chamber sleeve area . IV . BENEFTS OF THE EGRET MEDICAL DEVICE 1 . The catheter contain non-leaching antimicrobial agent enables product use safely fourteen ( 10 ) day . 2 . Based previous in-vitro testing , Egret product BIOSAFE find reduce bacteria count extend time . 3 . Minimizing frequency change-out close catheter system reduce chance cross-contamination since air way open less frequently , e.g. , every five day versus daily . 4 . Less frequent product change-out reduces need manipulate ET-Tube . The ET-Tube manipulate , great chance upper airway content trap cuff enter pulmonary bed . 5 . The catheter reduce bacteria colonization span use 6 . The swivel connector enable accessory easily connect disconnect . 7 . An integrated positive lock valve facilitates use prevents gas escaping use . 8 . A uniquely design filter incorporate device 's manifold provide 95 % BFE level prevent cross-contamination caregiver patient . 9 . Egret 's device MRI safe - metal part use assembly . V. PRODUCT BE EVALUATED : Product Code Description Size 454 Egret 14 Fr . T-Piece - Extended use 14 FR/4.6 mm 54 cm ( 21.75 '' ) length VI . INVESTIGATOR David Barton , BA , RRT , RCP VII . SPONSOR Egret Medical Products Inc. VIII . AFFLICATION OF APPLICANT Egret Medical Products Inc. IX . FUNDING AGIENCIES Egret Medical Products Inc. X . ANTICIPATED TEST DATES April 2008-May 2008 XI . METHODOLOGY : 1 . Egret provide 100 unit product support use testing requirement 2 . An in-service meeting hold Egret facilitator prior begin test ensure participant aware use test requirement responsibility . 3 . During test period , Egret product use instead specific normally used procedure 10 day need . 4 . This device use per exist Medical City Policy RCSCC12 exception change- required daily , Egret device use 10 day extubation . 5 . Careful instruction give caregiver catheter flush rinsed suctioning . This step essential maintain patency catheter well reduce bio- burden catheter must combat . 6 . Clinical Trial Subject Tracking - As per attached spreadsheet , product installation usage track investigator . Products provide Egret discreetly number 1 thru 100 bottom suction catheter valve . 7 . Arrangements make MicroChem Laboratory , Inc. conduct total aerobic bio-burden use method use baseline study . 8 . After product use , representative sample red bagged sent courier MicroChem conduct aerobic bacterial testing . Transportation test requirement clearly outline approved test protocol . 9 . Egret personnel present Medical City facilitate observe use test product duration test period . 10 . At completion test period , healthcare participant complete questionnaire concern Egret use test product compare exist Ballard product . 11 . All test product end test period return Egret . 12 . During evaluation , caregiver perceives defect failure , caregiver contact investigator assessment . Products perceive defective set aside additional evaluation Egret . XII . DATA TO BE COLLECTED : After product use , healthcare participant complete write questionnaire concern test device per attach . XIII . DELIVERY OF PRODUCT : Available test product deliver use-test site per Medical City instruction . XIV . RECOVERY OF PRODUCT : The investigator responsible gathering unused test product return Egret . XV . SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS : Participants brief specific feature Egret 's extend use product test facility . XVI . TEST FACILITATORS : Egret provide on-site qualified personnel assist resource require Medical City . XVII . APPROVALS Study Director : Richard C.
