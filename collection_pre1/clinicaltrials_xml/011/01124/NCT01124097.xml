	<detailed_description>Post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) syndrome intractable pain follow acute infection herpes zoster ( shingle ) . Treatment PHN often suboptimal . More 50 % subject fail respond pharmacological treatment experience intolerable side effect . The clinical development ESL treat neuropathic pain base chemical pharmacodynamic relationship sodium channel blocker , include carbamazepine , effective treat neuropathic pain condition . Preclinical data support theoretical background . This study examine efficacy , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics Eslicarbazepine acetate treatment post herpetic neuralgia .</detailed_description>
