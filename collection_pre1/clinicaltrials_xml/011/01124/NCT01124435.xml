	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate antitumor activity potential adverse effect combination celecoxib plus carboplatin patient recurrent , heavily pre-treated Ovarian Cancer ( OC ) . The potential change induce experimental combination angiogenesis-related serum marker quality life measure also evaluated.The main objective evaluate response rate . Secondary objective follow : toxicity ; progression free survival ; overall survival ; duration response ; quality life ; modulation angiogenesis-related molecule .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination Carboplatin Plus Celecoxib Heavily Pre-treated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II prospective study conduct Gynecologic Oncology Units Catholic University Rome Campobasso , Italy . The study non-sponsored , investigator initiate . The primary objective determine tumor response rate RECIST criterion . Secondary objective include duration response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) , toxicity assessment , QoL measures.Patients require take celecoxib ( 200 mg tablet mouth twice daily , day 1 28 ) , associate intravenous carboplatin ( area curve ( AUC ) 5 30 60 minute , every 28 day ) . Patients develop carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction ( HSR ) follow desensitization protocol , alternatively switch cisplatin . Erythropoietic stimulating agent myeloid growth factor permit cycle 1 study treatment , use choose treat physician , accord hospital policy.Treatment discontinue follow event occur : radiographic clinical evidence cancer progression ; deterioration health intolerable toxicity ; patient refusal . Before start treatment , patient evaluate medical history , physical examination , cell blood count ( CBC ) , chemistry panel , Ca125 , either compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging scan . The primary endpoint determine overall response ( OR ) rate . Secondary endpoint include assessment duration response , PFS , OS , toxicity event QoL score . When treatment discontinue , patient receive follow-up visit every 3 month</detailed_description>
