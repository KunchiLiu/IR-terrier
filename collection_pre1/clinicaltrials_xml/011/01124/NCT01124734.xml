	<brief_summary>The investigator recently observe many patient receive high dose Interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) fail respond go immediately temozolomide seem enjoy extremely good response seem good quality long duration typically observe temozolomide alone . To date , investigator observe 5 sequentially treated patient metastatic melanoma fail high dose IL-2 go receive immediate temozolomide . Two patient complete response 3 strong partial response . In recent phase II study extend low dose temozolomide alone give manner post IL-2 patient note , response rate 12.5 % partial response . The response investigator observe much high rate response well much good quality expect temozolomide . The response also well observe temozolomide give first follow high dose IL-2 . The investigator conclude perhaps major benefit investigator observe result prior high dose IL-2 therapy modulate temozolomide sequence treatment clearly crucial response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metastatic malignant melanoma remain disease poor prognosis median survival duration less one year . Durable remission conventional therapy rare therefore clinical trial remain primary treatment modality metastatic disease . There 2 currently FDA-approved therapy metastatic melanoma . Chemotherapy single agent parenteral dacarbazine oral pro-drug , temozolomide , capable produce response 6.5 20 % patient . These response usually minor partial best durable . Combination chemotherapeutic drug successful . The immune system also seem play role malignant melanoma . High dose Interferon therapy current standard therapy adjuvant treatment stage IIB , IIC III melanoma surgical resection show result modest improvement disease free survival overall survival . In metastatic disease , various immunologic approach employ well . High dose IL-2 produce response rate 10-15 % patient metastatic melanoma . About 5-10 % responses complete complete response durable lucky patient durable complete response intent purpose cure . Attempts combine chemotherapy immunotherapy , although improve response rate , impact survival summarize recent meta-analysis .</detailed_description>
