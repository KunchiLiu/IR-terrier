	<brief_title>MGuard Stent ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Embolization thrombotic debris still represent complication ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Distal embolization may decrease coronary myocardial reperfusion PCI STEMI set . Unfortunately , intracoronary filter present several important limitation limit use efficacy especially presence huge amount thrombus . In respect , recent trial investigate whether default manual thrombectomy strategy stenting would ameliorate angiographic well clinical outcome STEMI patient undergo percutaneous revascularization . Of note , embolization occurs guidewire , thrombectomy device cross thrombus , stent implant consequence plaque prolapse stent strut . MGuard net protective stent , investigational device , bare-metal stent cover ultra-thin flexible polyethylene terephthalate ( Dacron ) mesh sleeve , anchor external surface strut . This biocompatible fiber net ( string diameter 10-22 Î¼m ) minimal effect stent ' trackability deliverability . During stent deployment , net stretch slide expand stent strut , trap thromboembolic debris underneath fiber net isolate prothrombotic intima component blood stream . This protocol test hypothesis MGuard stent would superior conventional revascularization strategy ( i.e . bare-metal stenting plus manual thrombectomy ) , STEMI patient undergo urgent PCI term angiographic well clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
