	<brief_summary>STUDY HYPOTHESIS : Does outpatient NovaSureTM endometrial ablation alleviate excessive menstrual bleeding improve life quality effectively outpatient ThermachoiceTM endometrial ablation ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Effectiveness Two Different Outpatient Endometrial Ablation Techniques Used Heavy Periods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heavy menstrual bleeding ( HMB ) 'menorrhagia ' common condition major impact health-related quality life health resource utilization primary secondary care . In 50 % case organic pathology present term dysfunctional uterine bleeding ( DUB ) use . First line treatment DUB medical fails , surgery indicate use either minimally invasive approach ( endometrial ablation ) major surgery ( hysterectomy ) . Endometrial ablation extensively evaluate gold standard hysterectomy show effective associate few complication . The technique involve destroy entire , substantial proportion , endometrium thereby prevent cyclical endometrial regeneration suppress reduce menstrual blood loss . Recent advance endoscopic technology result development miniature , automate ablative system ( call 'second generation device ' ) , easy use , safe obviate need routine unpleasant expensive endometrial preparatory drugs10 . Moreover , device potential routinely use outpatient 'office ' setting without need general anaesthesia . This approach increasingly advocated expands patient choice potentially increase safety cost-effectiveness treatment . The three commonly employ evaluate ablative device ThermachoiceTM III thermal balloon ablation ( Gynecare Inc , Somerville , NJ , USA ) , Microwave endometrial ablation ( Microsulis plc , Waterlooville , Hampshire , UK ) NovaSureTM impedance-controlled endometrial ablation ( Cytyc , Marlborough , MA USA ) . All appear comparable efficacy employ inpatient general anaesthesia term patient satisfaction life quality although data direct head head comparison procedure perform outpatient environment scarce . All technique employ without need general anaesthesia11,16-19 , ThermachoiceTM report outpatient setting11 , without need formal theatre facility conscious sedation . The Microwave technique necessitate significant dilatation cervix limit potential use outpatient set contrast ThermachoiceTM NovaSureTM10 . The new NovasureTM system effective ThermachoiceTM inpatient study report high rate amenorrhoea ( cessation menstrual period - 43 % versus 8 % ) . Moreover , NovaSureTM may better technique use conscious patient outpatient set short procedure ( 1.5 versus 8 minute ) associate less post-operative pain16,19 require great degree potentially painful cervical dilatation10 . There thus need randomise trial compare effectiveness acceptability ThermachoiceTM NovaSureTM endometrial ablation outpatient set treatment menorrhagia .</detailed_description>
