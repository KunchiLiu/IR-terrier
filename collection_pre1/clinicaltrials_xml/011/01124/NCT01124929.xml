	<brief_summary>Most guideline treatment tuberculosis suggest 6 month treatment sufficient extrapulmonary tuberculosis except bone tuberculosis tubercular meningitis . Despite recommendation , physician treat abdominal tuberculosis use antituberculous therapy 9 month , sometimes even 12 month without scientific justification . In randomized controlled trial , Balasubramaniam et al report difference success rate 6mo ( 99 % ) vs 12 month ( 94 % ) antituberculous drug ( conventional strategy ) treatment abdominal tuberculosis . Although Directly Observed Therapy ( DOTs ) prove effective patient pulmonary tuberculosis , lymph nodal tuberculosis , however , lack data efficacy DOTS extra-pulmonary disease include abdominal tuberculosis . Therefore , urgent need establish efficacy DOTs strategy antituberculous therapy treatment abdominal tuberculosis .

	<detailed_description>Rationale Most guideline treatment tuberculosis suggest 6 month treatment sufficient extrapulmonary tuberculosis except bone tuberculosis tubercular meningitis . Despite recommendation , physician treat abdominal tuberculosis use antituberculous therapy 9 month , sometimes even 12 month without scientific justification . In randomized controlled trial , Balasubramaniam et al report difference success rate 6mo ( 99 % ) vs 12 month ( 94 % ) antituberculous drug ( conventional strategy ) treatment abdominal tuberculosis . Although DOTS prove effective patient pulmonary tuberculosis , lymph nodal tuberculosis , however , lack data efficacy DOTS extra-pulmonary disease include abdominal tuberculosis . The aim present study ass efficacy DOTs whether Cat I regimen 6 month effective treatment abdominal tuberculosis . We , therefore plan conduct multicenter randomize control trial determine difference efficacy recurrence rate 6months 9 month intermittent short course category I regimen RNTCP . Hypothesis There may significant difference efficacy recurrence rate abdominal tuberculosis treat six month vs treat 9 month intermittent short course category I regimen RNTCP . Objectives Primary objective : 1 . To determine efficacy intermittent short course chemotherapy 6 month Directly Observed Therapy ( Category I RNTCP ) treatment abdominal tuberculosis ( proportion patient respond treatment ) 2 . To determine difference recurrence disease two randomized group observation three month extension RNTCP Cat I three month subset patient definite clinical response 6 month DOTs Secondary objective 1 . To study effect anti-tubercular drug natural history intestinal stricture due tuberculosis Outcomes Outcome measure : Primary : 1 . Response treatment ( 6 month nine month RNTCP Cat I treatment ) define early 2 . Recurrence symptoms abdominal tuberculosis ( intestinal peritoneal ) 1 year follow receive 6 month 9 month Cat I treatment .</detailed_description>

Patients willing likely comply study procedure follow Patients give informed consent . Eighteen year cut age definition adult pediatric adolescent medicine . The dose drug different two age group . Therefore plan include patient 18 year age abdominal TB study . Intake ATT past 5 year Doubtful diagnosis Crohn 's disease Patients HIV AIDS may another systemic opportunistic infection include GI infection like cryptosporidiosis , Microsporidiosis isosporiasis . There may overlap GI manifestation diarrhea , abdominal pain , anemia , fever . Therefore , assessment response antituberculosis therapy may blur . In order keep study group homogenous comparison , plan exclude HIV infection Chronic Liver Disease Associated significant comorbidities H/O Sensitivity Peritoneal carcinomatosis Patients must use investigational agent past 6 month Unwilling patient</criteria>
