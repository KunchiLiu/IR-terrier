	<brief_title>HaemocomplettanÂ® P During Elective Complex Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibrinogen concentrate increasingly used surgical patient suffer excessive bleed refractory conventional hemostasis treatment . However , study publish far comprise small study group questionable study design . The aim study determine whether fibrinogen concentrate reduces blood loss transfusion patient undergoing elective complex cardiac surgery . By choose domain complex cardiac surgery prone excessive blood loss transfusion , focus subject undergoing high risk procedure . Hereby hypothesize administration fibrinogen concentrate improves hemostasis patient experience microvascular bleeding complex cardiac surgery . This improvement hemostasis measure reduced blood loss transfusion blood product surgery postoperative period . Furthermore , hypothesize fibrinogen concentrate safe well tolerated patient undergo complex cardiac surgery . This hypothesis investigate detailed study clinical outcome . Update regard interim-analysis : On 09 August 2013 interim-analysis perform describe protocol . The outcome discuss Steering Committe 09 October 2013 . During meeting , base result interim-analysis , continuation current study order .</detailed_description>
