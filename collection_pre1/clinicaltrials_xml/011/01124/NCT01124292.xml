	<brief_title>Evaluation Tongue Operated Assistive Technology Individuals With Severe Paralysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A new assistive neuro-technology ( ANT ) , call Tongue Drive System ( TDS ) , enable individual severe disability access environment nothing tongue motion . The human tongue inherently capable sophisticated control manipulation task many degree freedom . It move rapidly accurately within mouth tip touch every single tooth . The direct connection brain tongue generally allow escape damage even severe spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Unlike brain , tongue accessible , location inside mouth affords degree privacy . TDS consist magnetic tracer , size lentil , attach tongue gluing , implantation , pierce . The tracer generate magnetic field inside around mouth detected array magnetic sensor mount wireless headset . Tongue-movement-induced change magnetic field send wirelessly ultra-mobile computer smartphone , carry user , process translates every tongue motion particular user-defined function . Once individual disability `` enabled '' access compute device , he/she nearly everything able-bodied individual device . This include communicating , education , training , entertainment , control device power wheelchair ( PWC ) , assistive robotic manipulator , home/office appliance local area network ( LAN ) . Even individual 's natural prosthetic limb manipulate move functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) . This study intend evaluate TDS ultimate intend user , individual severe disability , best expert indicate benefit possible shortcoming new ANT . Our goal ass acceptability usability TDS various task important daily life computer access , wheel mobility , environmental control . Three group subject recruit : Group-A : Able-bodied subject already tongue pierce Group-B : Able-bodied subject want receive tongue pierce part trial Group-C : Subjects high-level disability , want receive tongue pierce part trial Each group subject participate battery task quantitatively measure performance access computer drive wheelchair use TDS . We also devise acceptable procedure receive magnetic tongue piercing ( require order use TDS ) , assess potential safety issue .</detailed_description>
