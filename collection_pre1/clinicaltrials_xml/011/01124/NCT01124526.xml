	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether rituximab administration fludarabine cyclophosphamide result , good , one obtain conventional therapy CHOP ( cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , vincristine , prednisone ) also determine whether rituximab administration maintenance treatment two year , increase global clinical response disease free time interval .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Response Duration Toxicity Rituximab , Fludarabine , Cyclophosphamide ( RFC ) 1st Line Treatment Rituximab ( R ) Maintenance Treatment Follicular Non Hodgkin ( FNH ) Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use monoclonal antibody , specifically chimerical humanize anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ( Rituximab , MabTheraÂ® ) represent one innovative aspect indolent lymphoma treatment . Preliminary data show 40 % 50 % response median response duration 6 11 month patient relapse FL . This response rate increase rituximab administer initial treatment . Therefore , due clinical result also tolerance , base innovative mechanism action minimal toxicity , seem reasonable raise possibility incorporate administration monoclonal antibody chemotherapeutic agent . The development new treatment scheme include Rituximab administration within treatment protocol combine fludarabine cyclophosphamide , whose result good one obtain conventional treatment CHOP , increase molecular response rate contribute therefore increase disease-free time interval ( time progression ) , without add toxicity , addition achieve high proportion clinical response ( global complete response ) . In order increase time interval progression , maintenance treatment carry 2 year , show evident benefit time progression preliminary study .</detailed_description>
