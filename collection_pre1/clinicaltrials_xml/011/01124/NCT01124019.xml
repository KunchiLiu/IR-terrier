	<detailed_description>Calculating risk woman develop breast cancer lifetime lead decrease mortality rate result increase screening prevention method person know high risk . Though several risk assessment model commonly use , important continue improve process calculate risk . Several genetic marker note potentially indicate risk develop breast cancer . New test , call SNP panel , detect genetic marker . This study aim use SNP panel commonly use risk model calculate risk examine outcome woman come screen mammography . This study enroll woman age 40-65 undergo screen mammography ( n=1000 ) , addition woman BIRADS category 4 mammogram reading undergo biopsy ( n=600 ) , personal history breast ovarian cancer , ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) , mantle radiation , know BRCA 1/2/mutation self family member . The participant expect rto provide consent , swabs inside cheek mouth , baseline questionnaire answer allow risk assessment perform .</detailed_description>
