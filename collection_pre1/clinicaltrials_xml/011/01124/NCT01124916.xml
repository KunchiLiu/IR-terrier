	<brief_summary>The purpose research determine difference total cost care return health woman undergo laparoscopic abdominal sacrocolpopexy ( ASC ) compare undergoing procedure assistance robot . Both traditional laparoscopic robotic assist laparoscopic approach find result shorter hospital stay , decrease blood loss similar surgical outcome compare open abdominal surgery . The decision use robotic assistance typically base surgeon preference robot availability . The study compare outcomes cost , quality life , return work among woman undergo laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy utilize robot use traditional laparoscopic technique . This research study design compare total cost treatment success two surgical technique . In addition , study compare outcomes post-operative pain , quality life , sexual function , return normal activity satisfaction treatment outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately one ten woman undergoes surgery prolapse incontinence lifetime . Of , thirty percent require re-operation recurrence prolapse incontinence symptom . It estimate one nine woman undergo hysterectomy lifetime , 10 % woman require surgery symptomatic vaginal vault prolapse . The search ideal repair pelvic organ prolapse lead invention several approach problem . Abdominal sacrocolpopexy ( ASC ) synthetic mesh consider gold standard surgical management pelvic organ prolapse anatomic success rate range 90 100 % . Randomized comparative effectiveness trial systematic literature review demonstrate anatomic superiority open ASC compare vaginal sacrospinous ligament suspension . Although ASC high anatomic success rate correct apical prolapse , traditionally do via laparotomy require abdominal incision . Open technique associate frequent short-term complication , include gastrointestinal . Minimally invasive approach ASC use laparoscopy robotic assist laparoscopy demonstrate shorter hospital stay , decrease blood loss , similar short-term anatomic outcome compare open ASC . Increasing number surgeon patient choose minimally invasive ASC maximize benefit abdominal place mesh shorter-recovery associate minimally invasive surgery . Few study compare laparoscopy robotic assisted-laparoscopy pelvic reconstructive surgery . Like many technique pelvic surgery , trend management pelvic organ prolapse continue evolve . Unfortunately , trend support robust data , specifically provide randomized clinical trial . Although robotic technology new rapidly spread throughout urologic gynecologic community , randomize trial compare outcomes robotic traditional laparoscopic technique reconstructive pelvic surgery . Retrospective series indicate comparable efficacy respect cure prolapse . However , date unknown robotic surgery compare laparoscopic technique respect cost , patient safety , pain , ability return normal activity . The use robot laparoscopic surgery costly . The cost purchase robot estimate $ 1.5 million dollar annual maintenance cost $ 112,0007 . In addition , additional cost exist robotic equipment utilized case . It arguable maintenance operative equipment cost may overshadow potential saving length hospital stay patient convalescence . However , robotic sacrocolpopexy provide good immediate quality life , less pain , fast recovery compare laparoscopic technique , investment robotic technique may well cost effective societal perspective take .</detailed_description>
