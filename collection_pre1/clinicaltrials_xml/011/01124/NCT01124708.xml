	<brief_summary>ADHD associate persistent deficit efficient allocation attention support notion regulation cholinergic system may improve cognitive deficit ADHD . It suggest effect nicotine pronounced task demand effortful processing ( Rusted Warburton 1994 ) . In addition , recent theory propose cholinergic system allocate additional attentional resource task demand ( i.e . sustain attention , set shifting , etc ; Sarter Bruno 1997 ) . Thus may ADHD , cholinergic system under-responsive under-developed thus stimulation nicotinic receptor via nicotinic agent may result improved cognitive performance particularly test require effortful processing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomize , parallel , forced-titration design use assess effect TC-5619 versus placebo efficacy . A parallel group design allow effect TC-5619 clearly establish , randomized nature design allow minimization observer subject bias . Because force dose up-titration design use , effect individual dos preliminary , design confounds dose time . The dos choose ( 1mg , 5mg , 25mg ) reflect appropriate range around anticipate efficacious dose ( 3-10 mg ) , base upon preclinical extrapolation human , upon pro-cognitive effect TC-5619 identify CDR MRD study ( Targacept Study TC-5619-238-CLP-002 ) . All subject tobacco non-users . It possible tobacco ( nicotine ) interfere Î±7 NNR-mediated effect .</detailed_description>
