	<brief_summary>The objective study demonstrate , add tiotropium ( TIO ) , fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination ( FSC ) DISKUS 250/50 significantly increase exercise endurance time ( EET ) endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWT ) , compare TIO alone . Male female subject least 40 year age diagnosis Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) eligible . Subjects screen consent 6-week ( wk ) period prior visit ( V ) 1 . The 4-wk run-in period begin immediately V1 , subject receive open-label TIO plus as-needed relief inhaler ( identical formulation call albuterol US salbutamol Canada ) . At V2 , subject perform incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT ) establish maximal walk response . The first ESWT occur V3 . Subjects must demonstrate EET ≤20 min reproducible ( EET V3 V4 vary ≤2 min ) . Eligible subject randomize V5 either FSC 250/50mcg DISKUS twice daily plus open label TIO 18 mcg daily , placebo DISKUS twice daily plus open label TIO 18 mcg daily 4-wk treatment period . The last study visit V6 . The primary efficacy measure difference EET V6 ( wk-8 ) vs. V4 ( wk-3 ; last ESWT do randomize study drug give ) . Secondary efficacy measure include V6 vs. V4 comparison exercise dyspnea scale ( EDS ) , exercise inspiratory capacity ( EIC ) cardio-respiratory measurement ( CRM ) , V6 vs. V5 comparison dyspnea related activity daily live ( baseline dyspnea index transition dyspnea index interviewer-administered [ BDI-TDI ] ) quality life ( Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Self-administered Standardized [ CRQ-SAS ] ) . The safety measure assessment adverse event .

	<detailed_description>We postulate add fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination DISKUS 250/50 ( FSC ) tiotropium ( TIO ) improve exercise endurance time ( EET ) clinical physiologic correlate , base combination three different mechanism action represent . We propose test hypothesis compare outcome exercise test ( Endurance Shuttle Walk Test ; ESWT ) FSC add TIO compare TIO alone . The primary objective demonstrate , add TIO , FSC significantly increase EET compare TIO alone Visit 6 ( V6 ; week [ wk ] -8 ) vs. V4 ( wk-3 ; last ESWT double-blind drug ) . Secondary efficacy measure follow . Exercise dyspnea scale ( EDS ) , exercise inspiratory capacity ( EIC ) cardio-respiratory measurement ( CRM ) involve V6 vs. V4 comparison . Dyspnea related activity daily live ( ADLs ) assess use baseline dyspnea index transition dyspnea index interviewer-administered ( BDI-TDI ) , quality life assess use Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire Self-Administered Standardized ( CRQ-SAS ) . The BDI-TDI CRQ-SAS base comparison data V6 vs. V5 . We also attempt validate prospectively minimal clinically-important difference ( MCID ) change EET correlation dyspnea ( Likert scale ) . Safety evaluation include type , incidence severity adverse event . This randomized , parallel-group study total 6 visit . Screening 6 wk prior V1 , include discussion study procedure , review inclusion/exclusion criterion , collection inform write consent , adjustment medication determination spirometry pre- post-albuterol/salbutamol . At V1 , subject meet inclusion criterion enrol , familiarize incremental shuttle walk test ( ISWT ) , give paper diary . The run-in begin dispense open-label medication end V1 . During 4-wk run-in , subject 3 visit ( V2-V4 ) . Open-label TIO take daily begin V1 , open-label relief inhaler ( identical formulation call albuterol US salbutamol Canada ) take as-needed basis begin V1 . Open-label medication withhold V2 , V3 V4 ( last dose TIO , morning day visit ; last dose albuterol/salbutamol , least 6 hr start visit ) . At V2 , subject give open-label TIO , undergo ISWT 2.5-hr post-TIO , familiarize ESWT . At V3 V4 , subject give open-label TIO , undergo ESWT 2.5-hr post-TIO . ESWT perform V4 EET V3 ≤20 min . Subjects study V5 EET result V4 also ≤20 min EET V3 V4 vary ≤2 min ; otherwise , subject withdraw . The ESWT V4 use baseline EET exercise-related outcome last ESWT do double-blind study drug give . Open-label medication withhold V5 V6 ( last dose TIO morning day visit ; last dose albuterol/salbutamol , least 6 hr start visit ) . At V5 , subject undergo spirometry , lung volume diffuse capacity , randomize . Subjects give open-label TIO double-blind DISKUS study drug , undergo spirometry lung volume 2 hr post-TIO/double-blind DISKUS study drug , ESWT 2.5 hr post-dose . Per randomization , subject receive 4 wk V5 , open-label TIO plus either FSC placebo DISKUS . Double-blind DISKUS study drug withheld V6 ( last dose even day visit ) . V6 last study visit , consist spirometry lung volume , follow open-label TIO double-blind DISKUS study drug , spirometry lung volume 2 hr post-dose , final ESWT 2.5 hr post-dose . All study visit begin check-up determine eligibility study procedure . Details paper diary report review drug administration , V2 V6 . Immediately review paper diary , BDI ( V5 ) , TDI ( V6 ) CRQ-SAS ( V5 V6 ) undertaken , post-dose study activity , outline , follow . Final contact telephone approximately 2 wk V6 Early Withdrawal . The total duration study 8 wk , include 4 wk run-in 4 wk period double-blind plus open-label treatment . There also screen period 6 wk prior V1 , 2-wk period final study visit phone call follow-up . Subjects subset site undergo EIC CRM ESWT use portable telemetric monitoring ( Oxycon Mobile ; CareFusion , San Diego , CA ) .</detailed_description>
