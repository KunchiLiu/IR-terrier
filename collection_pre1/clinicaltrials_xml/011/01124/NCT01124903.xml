	<brief_summary>The sport medicine literature provide consensus threshold value constitute euhydration ( normal body water ) use variety hydration assessment marker ( e.g. , blood , urine ) . The investigator add literature provide decision level multiple body fluid use start point diagnose treat dehydration . At present , plasma osmolality ( Posm ) provide best potential measure static dehydration assessment ( spot measure ) , dynamic dehydration assessment ( serial monitoring ) best accomplish use change value Posm , urine specific gravity , body mass ( weight ) . These finding consider useful clinical , military , sport medicine community .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Well-recognized marker static ( one time ) dynamic ( monitoring time ) dehydration assessment rigorously test usefulness clinical , military , sport medicine community . This study evaluate component biological variation accuracy potential marker plasma , urine , saliva , body mass , static dynamic dehydration assessment . Design : Eighteen healthy volunteer ( 13M , 5F ) study carefully control hydration numerous pre-analytical factor . Biological variation determine three consecutive day use publish method . Atypical value base statistical deviation homeostatic set-point examine . Measured deviation body fluid produce use separate , prospective dehydration experiment evaluate ROC analysis quantify diagnostic accuracy . All dehydration marker display substantial individuality half display marked heterogeneity intra-individual variation . Decision level dehydration marker within one standard deviation ROC criterion value nearly identical prospective group mean dehydrate volunteer 1.8 - 7.0 % body mass . However , plasma osmolality ( Posm ) show statistical promise use static dehydration assessment . A 301 Â± 5 mmol/kg diagnostic decision level propose . Reference change value ( RCV ) 9 mmol/kg ( Posm ) , 0.010 ( urine specific gravity , Usg ) , 2.5 % change body mass ( Bm ) also statistically valid dynamic dehydration assessment 95 % probability level . Posm useful marker static dehydration assessment . Posm , Usg , Bm valid marker set dynamic dehydration assessment .</detailed_description>
