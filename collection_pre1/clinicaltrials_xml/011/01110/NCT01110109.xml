	<detailed_description>The development pneumonia infection intubation intraoperative set well-studied . An understanding content fluid accumulate cuff set strengthen relationship intubation infection . The purpose study characterize content fluid extract endotracheal tube cuff surgery . This study also evaluate content fluid across various interval suction . Suctioning Schemes - - Continuous Suctioning Anesthesia staff suction secretion continuously 20 mmHg safety stop 5 second every 30 minute . Staff responsible monitoring interval safety stop . - Intermittent Suctioning Anesthesia staff suction secretion intermittently use intermittent suction regulator . The regulator set suction 100-150 mmHg . The regulator preset cycle intermittent suction 15 second 8 second pause . This prospective randomize clinical study 48 subject single site United States . Those place tube perform suction scheme experience study staff meet training requirement ensure consistency . Subjects patient undergo surgery require intubation use TaperGuard Evac Endotracheal Tube minimum two hour , long twelve hour . They must also 18 year age old , able provide consent presence tracheostomy . Pregnant subject also exclude . Suctioning begin soon tube place continue extubation patient move operating room , whichever come early . Secretions collect Lukens Trap . Anesthesia staff collect accumulate secretion every 30 minute duration surgery , secretion process accord instruction provide sample collection kit . To address first objective study , first last sample obtain subject analyze individually pH , volume , microorganism ; sample evaluate volume . The amount colony form unit ( CFUs ) determine semi-quantitatively across organism , present separately individual genus specie . The sample characterize descriptive statistic include frequency , percentage , mean , median , standard deviation , 95 % CIs . To address second objective study , comparison pH , volume , microorganism , CFUs suction scheme patient-level characteristic conduct use chi-squared test independence analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Graphical method develop aid interpretation , function time cumulatively time .</detailed_description>
