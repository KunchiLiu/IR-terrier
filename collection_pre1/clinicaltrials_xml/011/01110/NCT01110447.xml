	<brief_title>Secondary Prophylaxis Hepatic Encephalopathy With Probiotic Preparation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) represent spectrum neuropsychiatric abnormality see patient liver dysfunction exclusion know brain disease . The Working Party 11th World Congress Gastroenterology , Vienna propose multi-axial definition HE define , type hepatic abnormality ( type A , B C ) duration/characteristics neurological manifestation ( episodic , persistent minimal HE ) chronic liver disease . Overt hepatic encephalopathy occur 30 % -45 % cirrhotic patient 10 % -50 % patient transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt . Development HE associate poor prognosis . Bustamante et al report survival probability 42 % 1 year follow-up 23 % 3 year patient cirrhosis first episode acute HE . The primary treatment HE identification treatment precipitate factor . The majority drug use treatment HE primarily direct reduction elimination increase neurotoxic ammonia level . A meta-analysis 22 randomized trial highlight lack data support efficacy nonabsorbable disaccharide ; however , investigator conclude current evidence insufficient support refute use nonabsorbable disaccharide treatment HE . Recent study well define group however demonstrate efficacy lactulose . Alternative therapy benzodiazepine receptor antagonist , branched-chain amino acid , L-ornithine-L-aspartate also show role . Antibiotics effective treatment HE , adverse effect concern long-term safety limit widespread use . Probiotics may multiple beneficial effect prevention and/or treatment HE . All four publish study effect probiotic hepatic encephalopathy demonstrate efficacy . Treating patient prevent development first episode classified primary prophylaxis HE prevent recurrence HE patient previous episode HE secondary prophylaxis HE . Sharma et al recently demonstrate lactulose effective secondary prevention HE . This study assess effect probiotic preparation prevention recurrence HE ( secondary prophylaxis ) patient recovery episode overt HE .</detailed_description>
