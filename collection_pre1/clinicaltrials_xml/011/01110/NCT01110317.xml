	<brief_title>A Study Paliperidone Blood Concentrations Patients With Schizophrenia After Administration Paliperidone Palmitate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( patient know name study drug receiving ) , randomize ( patient select `` chance '' like `` flip coin '' administration study drug intramuscular [ i.m . ] injection gluteal [ buttock ] deltoid [ upper arm ] muscle body ) study patient schizophrenia . A minimum 40 patient ( 20 patient per group [ 1 group patient administer study drug injection gluteal muscle 1 group patient administer study drug injection deltoid muscle ] ) participate study , include least 4 woman group . The study consist screen period occur within 21 day first study drug administration , open-label treatment period patient receive total 4 injection study drug ( paliperidone palmitate ) either deltoid gluteal muscle , end-of-study visit final study evaluation perform . At screen visit , patient treat antipsychotic medication study entry , medication may continue study except medication specify exclusion criterion study . If patient previously treat 1 follow antipsychotic drug : risperidone , paliperidone , paliperidone palmitate , undergo 4-day evaluation period give 3 mg/day dose extend release ( ER ) formulation paliperidone evaluate ability tolerate study drug . Patients meet entry criterion study randomly assign 1 2 treatment group receive 100 mg equivalent paliperidone palmitate i.m . injection either gluteal muscle deltoid muscle . Blood sample pharmacokinetics ( ie , test concentration study drug blood ) collect specify time dose study drug . A single blood sample may also collect time screen first day i.m . administration study drug patient agree participate optional part study call pharmacogenomic evaluation evaluation genetic information obtain patient 's blood use predict whether study drug help make patient well . During study , patient 's psychiatric symptom , severity symptom , injection site reaction evaluate . The primary outcome measure study determination concentration paliperidone patient 's blood study drug administration protocol-specified time point study . The patient 's safety monitor throughout study perform physical examination , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , monitor extrapyramidal symptom ( ie , symptom associate take antipsychotic medication ) , injection site evaluation , record adverse event ( side effect ) . Each patient receive total 4 paliperidone palmitate 100 mg equivalent injection gluteal deltoid muscle Day 1 , 8 , 36 , 64 .</detailed_description>
