	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia . B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) prevalent leukemia Western Hemisphere , account ~25 % leukemia 's . It represent monoclonal expansion small , long-lived , apparently slowly divide CD5+ B cell . Because low proliferative index presume uniform proliferative rate B-CLL cell vivo ( fact yet test document ) , B-CLL appear primarily disease accumulation rather proliferation . B-CLL remain incurable illness survival benefit early intervention . Therefore , patient early stage disease usually follow closely without initiate treatment . Patients extensive disease progressive cytopenia eventually treat cytotoxic agent , without prednisone , nucleoside analogues promote apoptosis leukemic cell . The clinical outcome disease determine profound dysregulation immune system result infection autoimmunity leukemic infiltration destruction organ . Autoimmune phenomena common frequently direct hematopoietic cell , result autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( 10-25 % ) immune thrombocytopenia .</detailed_description>

Must meet clinical laboratory criterion BCLL ( i.e. , compatible clinical history physical exam , presence lymphocytosis , i.e. , &gt; 10,000 lymphocyte / mm3 , evidence monoclonal population CD5+/CD19+/CD23+ cell periphery dim surface membrane lg L chain isotype restriction ) . All patient stag accord system Rai . Only new onset patient receive therapy enter heavy water leukemic cell turnover study . Patients hospitalize acute medical problem , related leukemia , within 4 week enrollment . A history second malignancy involve hematopoietic system , need extensive chemotherapy second malignancy ; patient active immunologic disorder ( e.g. , HIV AIDS ) , especially autoimmune problem ( e.g. , autoimmune hemolytic anemia cause BCLL ) . Patients impaired decisionmaking capability , e.g . dementia , psychosis , alcoholism , illicit drug use also exclude .</criteria>
