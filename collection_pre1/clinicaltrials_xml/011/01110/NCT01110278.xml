	<brief_summary>Urgency incontinence ( bladder muscle contract suddenly , cause immediate urge urinate difficult prevent ) commonly experience patient overactive bladder . New finding discover urgency incontinence may connect interaction certain region brain bladder . Although common problem , researcher still know interaction impact process urgency incontinence . The purpose study well understand brain function , use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) machine Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) create image brain different bladder state .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Bladder Control Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One devastate manifestation overactive bladder urgency incontinence . Although urgency incontinence common problem profound clinical , social psychological consequence , little understood underlying cause . The involuntary detrusor overactivity ( DO ) often associate disease point possible abnormality voluntary control spinobulbospinal voiding reflex high order neuronal network . Recent functional MRI ( fMRI ) PET study identify increased brain activity bladder fill void normal subject high order cognitive control center . In addition , data suggest interaction brain area , include pontine micturition center ( PMC ) , periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) , thalamus , insula , dorsal anterior cingulate prefrontal cortex , may abnormal patient urgency incontinence . Despite encouraging finding , yet know region interact , , unknown important , region brain . Nor know interaction might play role disease process . Expanding knowledge region integrate achieve continence , importantly , aspect complex circuitry atypical patient urge incontinence key future therapeutic endeavor . With mind , goal study well characterize functional integration ( i.e . functional connectivity ) brain 's control network relation typical atypical bladder function . We aim identify distinct difference brain 's functional anatomic topography woman without urgency incontinence . Our approach potential advance understand high level pathophysiology disease process , could also lead novel centrally act therapeutic approach treatment urgency incontinence .</detailed_description>
