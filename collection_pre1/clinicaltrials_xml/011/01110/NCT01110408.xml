	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Doripenem Compared With Cefepime Children Hospitalized With Complicated Urinary Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign study drug ) , double-dummy ( patient give placebo [ salt solution ] study drug alternate period time study ) , active comparator-controlled ( compare 'test ' treatment standard-of-care therapy ) , multinational , multicenter study establish safety tolerability antibiotic doripenem compare antibiotic cefepime administer intravenous ( iv ) infusion ( slow injection drug solution vein period time ) child age 3 month le 18 year hospitalize complicate urinary tract infection ( cUTI ) . The study include 3 period : pretreatment ( screen ) period occur within 2 day prior randomization ( assignment study drug ) ; treatment period 10 14 day patient receive study drug treatment , posttreatment period consist 2 study visit . The maximum duration study drug therapy 14 day . The total duration study approximately 7 8 week patient . Safety tolerability evaluate examine incidence , severity , type adverse event , change clinical laboratory test , vital sign measurement , finding physical examination record adverse event treatment posttreatment visit . An independent monitoring committee ( IDMC ) establish study ensure safety patient compromise . The IDMC consist individual associate conduct study , include limited individual expertise relevant care pediatric patient , include least one infectious disease physician least one statistician . IV study drug therapy ( Cefepime [ 50mg/kg 2g/dose ] doripenem placebo doripenem [ 20mg/kg 500mg/dose ] cefepime placebo administer every 8 hour 14 day . After receive minimum 3 day IV study drug therapy , patient may discharge hospital continue PO antibiotic therapy amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium , ciprofloxacin , alternative antibiotic therapy .</detailed_description>
