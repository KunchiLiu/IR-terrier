	<brief_summary>This Phase I Clinical Trial . Phase I study design determine amount investigational drug safely deliver define side effect limit dose . The drug administer study KML-001 . It highly soluble , orally available arsenic agent . It currently test determine effect telomerase activity . In word , purpose research study find high dose KML001 , give without cause severe side effect combine standard , commercially available anti-cancer drug call cisplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Of Cisplatin And KML-001 Platinum Responsive Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Telomerase enzyme synthesize specific DNA sequence find telomere body 's chromosome . It thus responsible maintain length telomere . Telomerase detect human cancer cell find 10-20 time active normal body cell . This provide selective growth advantage many type tumor . If telomerase activity turn , telomere cancer cell would shorten , like normal body cell . This would prevent cancer cell divide uncontrollably early stage development . In event tumor already thoroughly develop , may remove anti-telomerase therapy could administer prevent relapse . This study offer patient advanced cancer either standard therapy progress treatment one standard treatment . The primary objective study : To determine maximum tolerate dose KML001 combination cisplatin patient advanced malignancy . This objective met . The study reopen expansion cohort advance small cell lung cancer non-small cell lung cancer well ass activity combination , pending IRB approval . Secondary Objectives study : To determine pharmacokinetics KML001 cisplatin combination . To assess response rate , disease-free survival survival associate regimen . To correlate indication patient benefit ( response stable disease ) pretreatment specimens The high safest dos determine increase dos cisplatin KML001 successive group patient least serious side effect . All patient study receive dose cisplatin , know antitumor effect . The dos KML001 increase successive group patient . It possible enter study early may receive suboptimal dos KML001 . At end study hope determine appropriate dose KML001 combination cisplatin , learn side effect understand body metabolizes drug . Laboratory data UMGCC demonstrate combination KML001 cisplatin synergistic lung cancer cell line . Cisplatin best establish agent treatment lung cancer treatment regimens establish cisplatin ( congener , carboplatin ) . This synergism particularly interesting give anti-telomere effect cisplatin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer `` platinum responsive malignancy '' , include limited : esophageal cancer , ovarian cancer , germ cell malignancy , transitional cell cancer etc . curable chemotherapy , surgery radiotherapy . A tissue block fresh tissue biopsy require . Patients CNS metastasis symptomatic must receive therapy ( surgery , XRT , gamma knife ) neurologically stable steroid . Patients asymptomatic lesion without significant edema evidence shift allow participate without prior CNS therapy . Such patient anticipate receive specific CNS therapy 24 course therapy . Patients may receive prior systemic chemotherapy radiation therapy . At least 2 week elapse since last treatment patient recover previous significant toxicity ( i.e . grade 1 less ) . Alopecia , skin discoloration etc . consider significant toxicity . There limit number prior therapy . Patients may receive prior cisplatin platinum regimen . ECOG Performance Status less equal 2 . Patient 18 year age old . Absolute Granulocyte Count great equal 1.5 x 10^9 Platelet count great equal 100 x 10^9 Serum creatinine within normal limit , estimate measure creatinine clearance great equal 65 ml/min . All patient must inform investigational nature study must sign give write informed consent . Serum calcium , magnesium potassium must within normal limit . Patients must serious infection serious underlie medical condition would impair ability patient receive protocol treatment . These need specified history physical document signature eligibility checklist . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : 1 . Current uncontrolled cardiac disease ; 2 . Corrected ( Bazett ) QTc interval &gt; .50 m ( male ) &gt; .52 m ( female ) ; 3 . Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; 4 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy within 4 week registration ; 5 . Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; 6 . Patients acquire Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition patient know HIV positive . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception . Preexisting â‰¥ grade 2 peripheral neuropathy .</criteria>
