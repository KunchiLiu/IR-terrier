	<brief_title>Advisa MRI Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Advisa MRI IPG dual chamber , multi-programmable IPG . The IPG indicate restore heart rate , improve cardiac output , prevent symptom , protect arrhythmias related cardiac impulse formation conduction disorder . The IPG indicate use patient may benefit rate-responsive pace support cardiac output vary level activity modify use MRI exam . Subjects require follow-up visit implant , 2 month , 9-12 week , 3 month , 4 month , 6 month every 6 month thereafter study end . The MR scan occur 9-12 week visit .</detailed_description>
