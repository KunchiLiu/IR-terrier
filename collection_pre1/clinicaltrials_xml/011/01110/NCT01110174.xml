	<brief_summary>A pilot study adult ( ≥ 18 year ) woman stage II-III breast cancer receive preoperative chemotherapy prior mastectomy . Patients real-time serum glycan profiling , expression tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response additional mammography HD PET/CT examination assess response . The investigator hypothesize functional tumor assessment utilize high-definition positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( HD PET/CT ) , real-time serum glycan profiling , expression tissue MUC 1 oncoprotein isoforms predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy response breast cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized clinical trial pilot study . Consenting adult ( ≥ 18 year ) woman stage II-III breast cancer undergo receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy standard ACT regimen prior mastectomy . Prior begin chemotherapy , patient receive baseline mammogram , breast HD PET/CT , blood draw . Not 7 day prior second cycle chemotherapy , patient HD PET/CT diagnostic mammography image take assess early response treatment . Patients two additional mammography HD PET/CT examination : one first cycle chemotherapy , another upon completion last cycle chemotherapy mastectomy . The investigator collect data size ( maximum diameter , estimate volume ) 18FDG uptake ( SUV ) know primary breast cancer HD PET/CT . Blood sample patient 12 separate time point study glycan analysis . At least 3 ml take blood draw . The first blood draw take patient agrees enroll study . The second blood draw take prior first cycle chemotherapy . Thereafter , blood drawn serum glycan analysis cycle chemotherapy complete . After patient undergoes mastectomy , tissue collect MUC-1 assay two additional blood draw take .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient must sign informed consent participate study . Patient must ≥ 18 year age . Histologic diagnosis invasive breast cancer ( ductal lobular ) Stage II III breast cancer consider candidate curative mastectomy . Selected mastectomy surgical option treatment . Patient must agree receive standard dosedense adriamycin , cyclophosphamide , taxanebased chemotherapy give preoperatively . Patient must follow preoperative laboratory value confirm within 28 day prior registration : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 time ULN . Platelets ≥ 90,000/mm3 . White blood count ≥ 1,500/mm3 .
