	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . Subjects undertake screening period may last approximately 3 week , follow baseline period 1 week , randomise treatment period 5 week follow-up period approximately 2 week . This multi-centre , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled study subject least moderate intensity neuropathic pain result lumbosacral radiculipathy . It investigate efficacy , safety tolerability GW856553 . Approximately 142 subject randomise ensure 128 evaluable subject . Randomisation ratio 1:1 placebo GW856553 respectively . The dose GW856553 7.5 mg BID .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Male female subject age 18 80 year inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list protocol appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception 14 day last dose study medication . Male subject must agree use contraception method list protocol A diagnosis neuropathic pain due lumbosacral radiculopathy follow characteristic : Pain perceive one low limb site consistent area innervate L4 , L5 S1 nerve root , without sensory symptom affect area ; ( typically , pain may perceive buttock , thigh , calf , leg , foot toe ) . History pain suggestive cause lumbosacral radiculopathy due injury lumbosacral nerve root ( ) degenerative disease vertebrae lumbosacral spine associate soft tissue include intervertebral disc , secondary spinal injury due infection/abscess , haematoma malignancy . Duration pain least 12 week since onset . Intensity pain stable 2 week prior Screening , base clinical history . As part neurological examination , investigator must also conduct procedure specify Standardised Evaluation Pain [ Neuropathic Pain ] ( StEP ) instrument [ Scholz , 2009 ] 2 , calculate total score . In clinical opinion investigator , diagnosis lumbosacral radiculopathy support least one follow feature Screening documented medical note relation current symptom : Pain/sensory disturbance dermatomal/myotomal distribution precipitate exacerbated straight leg raise ( straight leg raise test perform specified StEP ; Neurological examination lower limb show impair muscle power , sensory function deep tendon reflex territory affect nerve root ; The total StEP score great 4 ( indicative lumbosacral radiculopathy cause pain ) ; Electromyographic ( EMG ) evidence denervation muscle innervate affect nerve root ; Quantitative sensory test ( QST ) show evidence alter sensory threshold dermatome innerved affected nerve root ; At Screening , investigator satisfy diagnosis base clinical review , result investigation related current symptom already document medical note , essential investigator conduct computerise tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , EMG QST . It requirement eligible subject nature spinal disease establish imaging ( CT/MRI ) review neuroradiologist / Investigator prior start study medication . This CT/MRI review Investigator ensure consistent clinical diagnosis without aetiology exclusion criterion Subjects medication neuropathic pain ( may include study stable dos medication least 4 week prior baseline period ( Day 7 ) continue stable dos study . Subjects ' baseline average daily pain score neuropathic pain due LSR PINRS , calculated average daily PINRS score baseline period ( Day 7 Day 1 ) , great equal 4 PINRS , washout prohibit medication . Male subject must agree use contraception method list protocol . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication 14 day last dose study medication . Subject provide full write informed consent prior performance protocolspecified procedure , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Key Subjects , opinion Investigator , unable reliably delineate ass pain anatomical location/distribution ( e.g . subject reliably tell difference back pain lower limb pain rate intensity separately ? ) . Subjects lumbar canal stenosis pain low limb occur solely walk rest . Subjects cause neuropathic pain specify inclusion criterion [ e.g . postherpetic neuralgia , painful diabetic neuropathy , mononeuritis multiplex , central poststroke pain , fail back surgery relation present episode radiculopathy , spinal abscess/infection/haematoma/malignancy , phantom limb pain , peripheral neuropathy due alcoholism , malignancy , HIV , syphilis , drug abuse , vitamin B12 deficiency , hypothyroidism , liver disease , toxic exposure ] , pain associate substantial somatic pain component [ e.g.nonneuropathic / musculoskeletal pain low limb part body apart back ] one cause potential cause pain symptom concurrent rheumatic disease limit fibromyalgia , rheumatoid arthritis significant osteoarthritis . Any question regard acceptability aetiology neuropathic pain discuss GSK medical monitor . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A positive test HIV antibody positive history HIV . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen History liver disease within last 6 month [ exception know Gilbert 's disease ] . History excessive regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study . History presence significant cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , renal disease condition know interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion drug , opinion Investigator may interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History presence clinically significant abnormality vital sign / ECG / laboratory test , medical psychiatric condition , , opinion Investigator , may interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Subject clinical evidence recent major depression ( medical history ) except subject already control antidepressant screen . Subjects , clinical judgement investigator , may malinger motivated secondary gain participation study , exclude . Unable stop remain abstained nonpharmacological treatment neuropathic pain study History hypersensitivity GW856553 component thereof history drug Pregnant lactating female Subjects condition require immunosuppressive therapy , otherwise consider immunosuppressed .</criteria>
