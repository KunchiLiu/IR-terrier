	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Doripenem Compared With Meropenem Children Hospitalized With Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign study drug ) , double-dummy ( patient give placebo [ salt solution ] study drug alternate period time study ) , active comparator-controlled ( compare `` test '' treatment standard-of-care therapy ) , multinational , multicenter study evaluate safety study drug ( doripenem meropenem ) administer intravenous ( iv ) infusion ( slow injection drug solution vein period time ) child age 3 month le 18 year hospitalize complicate intra abdominal infection ( cIAI ) . Complicated intra abdominal infection include limited appendicitis rupture and/or abscess ( local collection pu ) , acute ( severe intense ) gastric , duodenal ( begin section small intestine ) , gall bladder perforation ( hole wall stomach , small intestine , gallbladder ) , secondary peritonitis . The study include 3 period : pretreatment ( screen ) period occur within 2 day prior randomization ( assignment study drug ) , treatment period 5 14 day patient receive iv study drug treatment IV study therapy switch oral antibiotic therapy , posttreatment period consist 2 study visit . The max duration study drug therapy 14 day . The total duration study approximately 7 8 week . Safety tolerability evaluate examine incidence , severity , type adverse event , change clinical laboratory test , vital sign measurement , finding physical examination observe treatment posttreatment visit . An independent monitoring committee ( IDMC ) establish study ensure safety patient compromise . The IDMC consist individual associate conduct study , include limited individual expertise relevant care pediatric patient , include least one infectious disease physician least one statistician . Patients receive IV Doripenem ( 20 mg/kg 500 mg/dose ) meropenem placebo OR meropenem ( 20 mg/kg 1 gram/dose ) doripenem placebo every 8 hour 14 day . If patient 's cIAI symptom improve 72 hour treatment iv study drug , investigator may choose stop iv study drug switch patient orally administer antibiotic ( amoxicillin/clavulanate postassium ) complete 5- 14 day course antibiotic therapy .</detailed_description>
