	<brief_title>An Observational Study Evaluate Quality Life ( QoL ) Influence Cognitive Status QoL Patients With Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis ( RRMS ) During 2 Years Treatment With Rebif New Formulation ( RNF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) acquire demyelinate disease unclear etiology , occur mainly adult . Multiple sclerosis occur 30-100 people per 100 000 . Usually disease attack young adult age 20 40 year . The peak occurrence population 30-35 year old . The main feature disease multifocal ( disseminate ) injury central nervous system . The injury cause various neurological symptom sign go ( relapsing-remitting form ) progress steadily , time cause irreversible damage nervous system permanent disability . In neuropsychological study , 40-65 % MS subject show cognitive impairment prominent involvement memory , sustain attention information process speed . Multiple sclerosis subject different disease course different cognitive profile . Cognitive dysfunction dramatic impact subject 's QoL , influence fulfillment work social life , independently physical disability . The methodology cognitive status assessment MS base establish set test , could conduce qualified neurophysiologists . There need simple test could quickly conduct every physician , provide information cognitive status/ one parameter ( attention/concentration ) . That kind information could immediately use physician visit adjust way take history give advice subject . During last 10 year 's enormous progress MS treatment . New drug appear proved diminish clinical activity disease slow progress . Early treatment disease modify therapy may reduce cognitive impairment slow progression cognitive deficit . The scope study evaluate cognitive status ( attention/concentration ) influence cognitive impairment QoL subject RRMS two year treatment RNF . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To evaluate QoL subject RRMS two year treatment RNF Secondary objective : - To evaluate cognitive status ( attention/concentration ) influence cognitive impairment QoL subject RRMS two year treatment RNF Subjects treat accord widely-acknowledged standard MS treatment choice drug depend solely medical indication . The potential subject prescribe Rebif first time treat physician give option enter observational study . As purely observational study , subject follow treat physician , accord current medical practice Rebif SmPC ( Summary Product Characteristics ) requirement ( i.e monitoring thyroid liver enzymes prior start therapy , hepatic function month 1 , 3 , 6 periodically thereafter , prescription antipyretic etc . ) After control visit , treat physician complete subject 's observation chart . The planned schedule visit identical routine schedule control visit dictate National Health Found : 1st Visit - 3 month RNF therapy start , 2nd Visit - 6 month , 3rd Visit - 9 month , 4th Visit - 12 month , 5th Visit - 18 month , 6th Visit - 24 month . `` 0 '' visit - doctor ask complete data subject history ( doctor give proposal test ( MusiQoL [ Multiple Sclerosis International Quality Life ] , MMSE [ Mini Mental State Examination ] 10-PCT [ 10-Point Clock Test ] ) subject visit disease-modifying drug [ DMD ] therapy institute ) .</detailed_description>
