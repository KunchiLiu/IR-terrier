	<brief_summary>Rationale : During exercise protein breakdown muscle large protein synthesis . This negative muscle protein balance lead increased muscle damage thereby reduce muscle tissue recovery . To achieve positive muscle protein balance reduce muscle damage , many athlete use protein . In professional soccer player , considerable stress place musculoskeletal system . Recovery time often short player restore homeostasis , result catabolic process . This increase play error lead lapse concentration . Therefore , great importance professional soccer team optimal condition fast recovery exercise desirable accomplish maximum performance . Supplementation whey protein thought support . Objective : To assess whether post-exercise supplementation whey protein lead good muscle recovery supplementation carbohydrates Dutch soccer player age 15 18 year old . Study design : A double blind randomise control cross-over trial . Study population : Healthy soccer player A B selection AJAX age 15 18 year old . Intervention : Supplement , contain either whey protein isocaloric carbohydrate placebo . Each supplement administer 2 week separate 7 day washout period . Treatment order randomly assign . Main study parameter : The main study parameter Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 2 score vertical jump test . The score evaluate soccer player ' ability repeatedly perform intense exercise potential recover exercise .</brief_summary>
