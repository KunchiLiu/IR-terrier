	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Simvastatin may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving simvastatin together panitumumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well simvastatin give together panitumumab work treat patient advanced metastatic colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine proportion ( least 40 % ) patient K-ras mutant-type advanced metastatic colorectal cancer free progression alive base RECIST criterion version 1.1 11 week first administration panitumumab ( i.e. , 12.5 week scan baseline start simvastatin ) . - To determine result comparable historical result k-ras wild-type colorectal carcinoma patient treat panitumumab . - To evaluate clinical sign progression ( accord RECIST criterion ) patient treat regimen . Secondary - To evaluate safety regimen patient fail prior treatment fluorouracil- , oxaliplatin- , irinotecan-containing regimen . - To evaluate overall survival patient treat regimen fail prior fluorouracil- , oxaliplatin- , irinotecan-containing regimen . - To evaluate progression-free survival ( base RECIST criterion version 1.1 ) patient . - To evaluate objective response rate ( base RECIST criterion version 1.1 ) patient . - To evaluate correlation skin toxicity anti-tumor response patient . Tertiary ( exploratory ) - To evaluate role serum cholesterol biomarker treatment panitumumab simvastatin . - To correlate level serum cholesterol treatment response factor , progression disease occur . - To investigate whether PTEN , PIK3CA , b-raf , ERK , MEK status correlate response panitumumab patient . - To investigate role single nucleotide polymorphisms related efficacy metabolism panitumumab predictor response panitumumab . - To investigate role proteomics ( e.g. , EGF ) potential predictive marker response panitumumab potential biomarkers treatment panitumumab . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral simvastatin daily day 1-14 panitumumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically biomarker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
