	<detailed_description>GSK573719 high-affinity , specific , reversible muscarinic receptor ( mAChR ) antagonist develop treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The long duration action GSK573719 , administer via inhalation human , support potential use long act bronchodilator COPD . This open-label , single dose , dose-ascending study healthy male subject establish well tolerate intravenous ( IV ) dose GSK573719 administer subsequent definitive human radiolabel metabolic study . The pharmacokinetics bioavailability single oral single inhale dose GSK573719 also evaluate . Blood urine sample pharmacokinetic analysis take regular interval 48 hour dose . Safety assess measurement heart rate , blood pressure , ECG , lead II monitoring twenty four hour Holter monitoring , safety laboratory data review adverse event .</detailed_description>
