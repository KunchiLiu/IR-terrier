	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety immune response live attenuate dengue vaccine could protect people 4 type dengue virus . Live attenuate mean vaccine contain 4 live dengue virus virus attenuate ( weaken ) cause dengue disease people . Dengue virus spread people mosquito cause sickness even death . Seventy-two subject age 18-45 year old enrol research study Saint Louis University Center Vaccine Development . Participants randomly assign 1 4 group receive 2 dos study vaccine placebo ( inactive substance ) . Study procedures include : maintaining diary record temperature side effect , physical exam , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) ( measure activity heart ) , blood sample . Participants involve study related procedure 10 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tetravalent Chimeric Dengue Vaccine Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity tetravalent dengue vaccine administer subcutaneously intradermally . The hypothesis test study whether tetravalent dengue vaccine may safely administer healthy normal individual intradermal ( ID ) subcutaneous ( SC ) injection provide measurable level serum neutralize antibody four dengue virus serotypes . The study also design compare safety immunogenicity rout administration dose level . The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability two-dose regimen tetravalent dengue vaccine administer either SC ID healthy adult volunteer . Two dose level test dose-escalation format . Safety tolerability measure conduct post-vaccination safety assessment include physical examination , injection site examination , adverse event monitoring , hematology , blood chemistry , urine dipstick . The secondary objective study assess immunogenicity vaccine , term neutralize antibody , four dengue serotypes administer two dose level two route administration healthy adult . Titers serum neutralize antibody measure pre-vaccination , prime boost vaccination assess compare titer two dose level well two route administration . In addition , viremia deriving attenuate vaccine virus measure day 0 ( baseline ) , 2 , 4 , 5/6 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 14 prime boost vaccination . Levels neutralize antibody also measure sample obtain day 180 270 analysis submission supplement study report . This study enroll 72 healthy flavivirus-negative male female subject age 18 45 .</detailed_description>
