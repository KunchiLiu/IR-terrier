	<brief_title>A Safety Tolerability Study Doripenem Compared With Cefepime Hospitalized Children With Bacterial Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign study drug ) , double-dummy ( patient give placebo [ salt solution ] study drug alternate period time study ) , active comparator-controlled ( compare 'test ' treatment standard-of-care therapy ) , multinational , multicenter study establish safety tolerability doripenem ( antibiotic ) compare cefepime ( antibiotic ) administer intravenous ( iv ) infusion ( slow injection drug solution vein period time ) child age 3 month le 18 year hospitalize pneumonia ( include nosocomial pneumonia [ NP ] , severe community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , ventilator-assisted pneumonia [ VAP ] ) . The study include 3 period : pretreatment ( screen ) period occur within 2 day prior randomization ( assignment study drug ) ; treatment period 10 14 day patient receive study drug treatment , posttreatment period consist 2 study visit . The maximum duration study drug therapy 14 day . The total duration study approximately 7 8 week patient . The primary outcome measure study safety tolerability . Safety tolerability evaluate examine incidence , severity , type adverse event , change clinical laboratory test , vital sign measurement , finding physical examination observe treatment posttreatment visit . An independent monitoring committee ( IDMC ) establish study ensure safety patient compromise . The IDMC consist individual associate conduct study , include limited individual expertise relevant care pediatric patient , include least one infectious disease physician least one statistician . Patients receive IV Doripenem ( 20 mg/kg maximum 500 mg/dose ) cefepime placebo OR cefepime ( 50 mg/kg maximum 2 grams/dose doripenem placebo every 8 hour 14 day . After receive minimum 3 day IV study drug therapy , patient may switch oral antibiotic ( amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium suspension tablet ) approve alternative oral agent complete total 10-14 day course antibiotic .</detailed_description>
