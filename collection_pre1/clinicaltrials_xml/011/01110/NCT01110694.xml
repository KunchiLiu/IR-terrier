	<brief_summary>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) progressive scar condition lung cause unknown.There currently effective treatment IPF condition tend cause progressive disability death average survival 3.5 year diagnosis . The condition responsible deaths 4000 people per year UK . At present definite diagnosis IPF rest identification specific pattern fibrosis section fibrotic lung tissue examine microscope . Unfortunately , process obtain lung biopsy require operation risk . The investigator hope identify specific marker blood lung patient IPF enable condition diagnose without biopsy . Furthermore , investigator hope identify indicator ( biomarkers ) predict patient aggressive progressive disease also identify biomarkers might useful identify response treatment might therefore used future clinical trial IPF . As well look marker blood lung investigator also plan assess use daily home lung function measurement computerise technique analyze lung sound see investigation able predict development worsen lung fibrosis .</brief_summary>
