	<brief_title>Safety Study Cell Therapy Treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main feature pulmonary emphysema , include range Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , airflow obstruction result destruction alveolar wall distal terminal bronchiole , without significant pulmonary fibrosis . The exist clinical approach contribute enlargement amelioration emphysema patient life quality , although effective curative treatment achieve . The surgical treatment , hand , involve complex procedure , specific case lung transplantation , lack donor . Considering aspect , several experimental model propose aim increase knowledge pathophysiological process enable new clinical approach pulmonary emphysema . The cell therapy , briefly describe use cell disease treatment , present promise therapeutic approach great potential applicability degenerative pulmonary disease . In way , intend project , proposition protocol evaluate safety cell therapy pool mononuclear cell bone marrow patient clinical laboratory diagnosis pulmonary emphysema advance stage ( stage IV dyspnea ) .</detailed_description>
