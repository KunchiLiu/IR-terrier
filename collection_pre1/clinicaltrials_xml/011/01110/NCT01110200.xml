	<brief_summary>This trial randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , multicenter study conduct United States . The purpose study evaluate rate exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) follow hospital discharge acute exacerbation COPD , patient receive either fluticasone propionate/salmeterol combination product 250/50mcg BID salmeterol 50mcg BID via DISKUSâ„¢ 29 week . The study population include patient hospitalized acute exacerbation COPD . The target enrolment 720 subject 80 study center . The primary endpoint rate exacerbation require hospitalization occur 21 day post-discharge , emergency room visit physician 's office visit exacerbation COPD require treatment oral corticosteroid oral corticosteroid antibiotic . The secondary endpoint rate COPD exacerbation require treatment oral corticosteroid , antibiotic , and/or hospitalization ( alone combination ) . Related efficacy endpoint include , time first exacerbation COPD require treatment oral corticosteroid , antibiotic , and/or hospitalization ( alone combination ) , pre-dose AM FEV1 , probability premature withdrawal subject study , supplemental albuterol use , change biomarkers inflammation , include , surfactant protein D ( SP-D ) , clara cell secretory protein 16 ( CC-16 ) high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) . Health outcome assessment include domain score evaluation fatigue , dyspnea , emotional function mastery , measure Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire self-administered standardized format ( CRQ-SAS ) ; symptom ( congestion , cough , phlegm , mucus , chest discomfort , shortness breath sleep disturbance ) , assessed EXAcerbations Chronic pulmonary disease Tool ( EXACT ) . Albuterol supply study subject use as-needed throughout study . Safety assess monitor adverse event .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible enrolment study must meet following criterion : Male female least 40 year age screening . To eligible entry study , female childbearing potential must commit consistent correct use acceptable method birth control start day visit 1 , throughout clinical trial , period trial account elimination drug ( minimum six day ) , define one following : Abstinence Females childbearing potential sexually active must commit complete abstinence intercourse Oral contraceptive ( either combine estrogen/progestin progestin ) Injectable progestogen Implants levonorgestrel etonogestrel Percutaneous contraceptive patch Intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) document failure rate le 1 % per year , Male partner sterile ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) prior female subject 's entry study sole sexual partner female subject , Doublebarrier method ; condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical /vault cap ) plus spermicide . Current former smoker &gt; 10 packyear cigarette smoke history [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) X number year smoke ( e.g. , 10 packyears equal 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ] . Former smoker define quit smoke least 3 month prior screen visit . Any following population : Patients hospitalize duration exceed 10 day due acute exacerbation COPD , must randomize within 10 day postdischarge . Patients COPD treat hold observation emergency department ( i.e . emergency room , ER ) least 24 hour due acute exacerbation COPD , must randomize within 10 day postdischarge . Patients receive oral corticosteroid oral corticosteroid antibiotic treatment exacerbation COPD physician 's office visit must randomize within 10 day visit , hospitalize within previous six month due acute exacerbation COPD . Clinical diagnosis COPD ( least 6 month ) . The following definition COPD American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) use : COPD disease state characterize presence airflow obstruction due chronic bronchitis emphysema ; airflow obstruction generally progressive , may accompany airway hyperreactivity , may partially reversible [ American Thoracic Society , 1995 ] . Documented evidence ( within year prior Visit 1 ) medical chart spirometry confirm diagnosis COPD and/or spirometry perform prior randomization ( Visit 2 ) confirms prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio less equal 0.70 prebronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 70 % predict . Review subject 's completion write informed consent : subjectsigned date write informed consent ( form ) must obtain prior study procedure , subject must willing comply requirement study protocol . Subject must able read , comprehend , record information English Spanish . Subjects meet follow criterion must enrol study : Diagnosis pneumonia , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , complicate comorbid condition hospitalize within last 6 month exacerbation COPD . Historical current evidence clinically significant uncontrolled disease include , limited , list . Significant defined disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation , would affect safety analysis analyse disease/condition exacerbate study . A previous lung resection surgery ( e.g . lobectomy , pneumonectomy , etc ) within year precede Visit 1 ( Screening ) Asthma primary diagnosis Lung cancer Cystic fibrosis , pulmonary fibrosis , active tuberculosis , sarcoidosis Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Uncontrolled hypertension Unstable angina Current malignancy previous history cancer remission &lt; 5yrs ( localize basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin resect exclude ) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism Immunologic compromise Cushing 's Addison 's disease An abnormal 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Visit 1 ( Screening ) deem clinically significant investigator . A chest Xray compute tomography ( CT ) scan perform 6 month precede Visit 1 reveal evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . If subject record chest Xray , one must obtain review prior randomization . Female patient positive urine pregnancy test Visit 1 . Any infirmity , physical disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Any adverse reaction , immediate delay , hypersensitivity Betaagonist , sympathomimetic drug , corticosteroid include component study drug formulation . Limited ability provide valid informed consent due psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation , current substance abuse ( include illicit drug alcohol ) , neurological disorder might interfere completion study procedure hear problem may impede effective communication . Study site staff ( i.e . participate investigator , subinvestigator , study coordinator , employee participate investigator ) family member site staff .</criteria>
