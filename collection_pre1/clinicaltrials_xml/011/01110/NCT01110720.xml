	<criteria>Probable possible PSP define : least 12month history postural instability fall first 3 year symptoms present ; screening , decrease downward saccade velocity define observable eye movement ( deviation `` main sequence '' linear relationship saccade amplitude saccade velocity ) , supranuclear ophthalmoplegia define 50 % reduction upward gaze 30 % reduction downward gaze ; age symptom onset 40 85 year history ; akineticrigid syndrome prominent axial rigidity . Aged 41 85 year time screen . Judged investigator able comply neuropsychological evaluation baseline throughout study . Must reliable caregiver accompany subject study visit . Caregiver must read , understand , speak local language fluently ensure comprehension inform consent form informantbased assessment subject . Caregiver must also frequent contact subject ( least 3 hour per week one time different time ) willing monitor study medication compliance subject 's health concomitant medication throughout study . Modified Hachinski score ≤ 3 ( Appendix 7 ) . This modified Hachinski include focal neurological sign , symptom pseudobulbar affect question , give prominence 3 PSP . Score ≥ 15 minimental state examination ( MMSE ) screening ( Visit 1 ) . Written inform consent provide subject ( legallyappointed representative , appropriate ) caregiver ( legallyappointed representative ) fluent local language speaker . Subject reside outside skilled nursing facility dementia care facility time screening , admission facility plan . Residence assist live facility allow . If subject receive levodopa/carbidopa , levodopa/benserazide , dopamine agonist , catecholomethyltransferase ( COMT ) inhibitor , Parkinson 's medication , teh exception Azilect ( rasagiline ) , dose must stable least 60 day prior screen visit ( Visit 1 ) must remain stable duration study . No medication initiate study . Subjects receive rasagiline CoQ10 must stable dose least 90 day prior screen visit . Able tolerate MRI scan screening either sedation low dose lorazepam . Able ambulate independently assistance defined ability take least 5 step walker ( guard allow provide contact ) ability take least 5 step assistance another person contact one upper extremity . Presence symptoms less 5 year presence symptoms 5 year PSPRS baseline score ≥ 40 . Stable chronic medication least 30 day prior screen visit ( Visit 1 ) . Insufficient fluency local language complete neuropsychological functional assessment . A diagnosis Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis motor neuron disease . Any following : Abrupt onset symptom define inclusion criterion 1 associated ictal event , Head trauma related onset symptom define inclusion criterion 1 , Severe amnesia within 6 month symptom define inclusion criterion 1 , Cerebellar ataxia , Choreoathetosis , Early , symptomatic autonomic dysfunction ; Tremor rest . Presence significant neurological psychiatric disorder include ( limited ) Alzheimer 's disease ; dementia Lewy body ; prion disease ; Parkinson 's disease ( subsequently revise PSP ) ; psychotic disorder ; severe bipolar unipolar depression ; seizure disorder ; tumor spaceoccupying lesion ; history stroke head injury loss consciousness least 15 minute within past 20 year . Within 4 week screen course study , concurrent treatment memantine ; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ; antipsychotic agent ( quetiapine ) mood stabilizer ( e.g. , valproate , lithium ) ; benzodiazepine ( except ) . Low dose lorazepam ( 2 mg ) may use sedation prior MRI scan subject require sedation . Neuropsychological testing may perform lorazepam administration . Subjects take short act benzodiazepine ( temazepam zolpidem allow ) sleep may continue stable dose 30 day prior screen . Clonazepam may use treatment dystonia painful rigidity associate PSP dose stable 90 day prior screen expect change course study . Treatment lithium , methylene blue , tramiprosate , ketone body , latrepirdine , putative diseasemodifying agent direct tau within 90 day screen . A history alcohol substance abuse within 1 year prior screen deem clinically significant site investigator . Any malignancy ( nonmetastatic dermatological condition ) within 5 year screen visit ( Visit 1 ) current clinically significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , neurological disease . For noncancer condition , condition stable least one year screen visit judge site investigator interfere subject 's participation study , subject may include . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality screen , include creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥ 3 time upper limit normal reference range , vitamin B12 laboratory normal reference range , thyroid stimulate hormone TSH laboratory normal reference range . The systolic blood pressure measurement &gt; 190 &lt; 85 mm Hg . The diastolic blood pressure measurement &gt; 105 &lt; 50 mm Hg screening . Abnormal ECG trace screen judge clinically significant site investigator . Treatment investigational drug device within 90 day screen . Known history serum plasma progranulin level le one standard deviation normal subject mean laboratory perform assay . Known presence know diseaseassociated mutation TDP43 , PGRN , CHMPB2 , VCP gene frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) causative gene associate underlying tau pathology ( e.g. , Chromosome 9 associate FTD ) . History deep brain stimulator ( DBS ) surgery sham surgery DBS clinical trial . History early , prominent rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep behavior disorder . Women pregnant lactate woman childbearing potential use least two different form medically recognize highly effective method birth control , result low failure rate use consistently correctly implant , injectables , combine oral contraceptive , IUDs , sexual abstinence vasectomise partner . An employee relative employee Sponsor , clinical site , Contract Research Organization participate study . Significant anatomical nasal abnormality ( e.g. , septal deviation obstruct airflow least one nostril septal perforation ) history nasal turbinate surgery . History clinically significant medical condition would interfere subject 's ability comply study instruction , would place subject increase risk , might confound interpretation study result . Contraindication MRI examination reason ( e.g. , severe claustrophobia , ferromagnetic metal body ) . Structural abnormality MRI preclude diagnosis PSP , cortical infarct brain region might account subject 's symptom . In subject receive antiParkinson 's Disease medication time screening , opinion investigator substantial worsen motor sign symptom compare normal function follow overnight withdrawal antiParkinson medication . Known hypersensitivity davunetide ingredient formulation .</criteria>
