	<brief_title>Prospective Comparative Study Refractive Outcome STAAR Alcon Toric Intraocular Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The improvement surgical technique well advance technology employed modern cataract surgery make safe procedure routine case . Moving forward , single pressing challenge face cataract surgeon develop country today ability achieve predictable accurate refractive outcome . Increasingly , surgeon patient alike come measure success surgery refractive outcome . Using partial coherence interferometry lead accurate biometry consequently predictable spherical result . This also help pave way satisfactory correction presbyopia multifocal intraocular lens ( IOL ) . Astigmatism also important component refractive equation . Estimates incidence significant , naturally occur astigmatism vary widely 7.5 % 75 % 1 . It think 3 % 15 % eye may 2 diopter ( D ) astigmatism2 . Many surgeon would agree astigmatism great 0.5 D visual consequence symptom ghost shadow aim spherical astigmatic outcome +/ - 0.5 D3 . Several method develop address reduce preexist astigmatism . While corneal relax incision astigmatic correction unpredictable highly surgeon dependent , opposite true toric IOLs . The refractive result associate use toric IOLs likely predictable independent corneal wound heal . The implantation IOL also less surgeon dependent . Other advantage associate toric IOLs include absence need additional astigmatic correction procedure cataract surgery , faster visual recovery well reversibility procedure . Studies carry evaluate efficacy rotational stability STAAR AA4203 TF/TL toric IOL since FDA approval November 1998 . These trial carry Caucasian eye show significant reduction pre-existing refractive astigmatism , improvement postoperative unaided visual acuity well excellent refractive well rotational stability ( latter especially TL model ) . Ruhswurm et al.6 review 37 eye STAAR toric IOL mean duration 20.3 month find 78.4 % eye residual refractive astigmatism within +/- 1.00 D 48.6 % within +/- 0.50D . 83.4 % eye achieve best-corrected visual acuity 20/40 better . Sun et al.7 demonstrate improved unaided visual outcome eye toric ( 130 eye ; 86.4 % visual acuity 20/40 better ) spherical IOL ( 51 eye ; 76 % visual acuity 20/40 good ) . Similar result also obtain Alcon toric IOL . In Horn et al.9 , clinical trial result 250 patient Alcon toric IOL described , demonstrate good unaided visual acuity 20/25 good 6-month postoperative visit ( 66 % patient unilateral toric implant 97 % bilateral implant ) . 97 % toric patient achieve spectacle freedom distance vision , compare 50 % control patient . It well document rotational stability toric IOL crucial efficacy astigmatic reduction . Theoretical calculation show estimate 1/3 astigmatic correction lose IOL rotate 10 degree axis , well potential worsen preoperative astigmatism presence 30 degree off-axis rotation . Toric IOL stability dependent multiple factor , one capsular bag size . Vass et al.11 show good correlation axial length capsular bag diameter ( CBD ) , especially eyes axial length le 25.0mm . On hand , highly myopic eye show great risk large CBD normal axial length . A formula derive calculate predict CBD ( CBDp ) show value great 10.3mm likely exist large CBD hence benefit implantation longer toric IOL due good centration . To date , trial carry evaluate result toric IOL either local population East Asia . There also prospective clinical trial conduct compare difference ( ) plate-haptic loop-haptic toric IOL . Hence , set evaluate compare efficacy , safety , predictability stability STAAR Alcon toric IOL Asian eye .</detailed_description>
