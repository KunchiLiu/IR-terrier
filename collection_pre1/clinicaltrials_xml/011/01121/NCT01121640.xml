	<brief_summary>The Novel Markers Trial compare safety , feasibility effectiveness two different epithelial ovarian cancer screen strategy use CA125 add HE4 either first second line screen . This study next step large research effort develop blood test use screen method early detection epithelial ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Using Novel Markers Predict Malignancy Elevated-Risk Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) usually lethal unless diagnose early stage , thus early detection likely play important role reduce mortality . Within Ovarian Specialized Programs Research Excellence Pacific Ovarian Cancer Research Consortium ( POCRC ) researcher work decade discover , develop , validate biomarkers ( protein substance find blood ) could help save life detect EOC early . During last five year several biomarkers , include CA125 , evaluate ability detect EOC earlier stage . The best marker study new randomize control trial ovarian cancer screening .</detailed_description>
