	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma ( NB ) , common cancer early childhood originate primitive sympathetic neural precursor , characterize remarkable heterogeneity clinical behavior spontaneous regression rapid progression death . The current therapeutic option develop accord Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) risk stratification criterion base clinical biological factor , include tumor stage , MYCN status , age diagnosis , histology , ploidy status . 1-2 The treatment strategy range observation alone intensive multimodality therapy depend risk stratification three subgroup low , intermediate , high risk death . Despite number molecular biologic factor identify predict prognosis , MYCN amplification , occur roughly 20 % primary NB , one powerful prognostic factors.3 The co-opting neurotrophin pathway include neurotrophin receptor ( TrkA , TrkB , TrkC ) ligands ( NGF , BDNF , neurotrophin-3 , respectively ) , regulate differentiation , apoptosis , growth neural cell , also important molecule relate prognosis NB.4 However , proportion patient MYCN nonamplified NB still present clinically aggressive progression similar MYCN amplify tumor , suggest unfavorable molecule exist inferior survival.5-6 The IGF-II RNA-binding protein 3 ( IMP3 ) , also know L532S K homology domain-containing protein overexpressed cancer ( KOC ) , member RNA-binding protein family include IMP1 , IMP2 , IMP3 . The IMPs primarily express early embryogenesis implicate various post-transcriptional function , include mRNA localization , cell growth , cell migration early embryogenesis.7-8 The IMP3 orthologue Vg1-RBP Xenopus also describe promote migration neural crest cells.9 Recently , IMP3 consider oncofetal protein increase proliferation invasion various cancer include pancreas , kidney , lung cancers.10-14 The expression IMP3 , however , low undetectable adjacent benign tissues.13 These line evidence indicate IMP3 capable potential biomarker predict cancer progression metastasis , may serve target molecule cancer therapy.14 oligonucleotide microarray powerful tool genome-wide screening candidate gene relate cancer prognosis.15 In study , 22 primary NB tumor subject oligonucleotide microarray analysis . Among differentially express gene accord patient ' prognosis , IMP3 show especially high expression level NB tumor carry unfavorable prognosis . Further evaluation IMP3 expression large sample size demonstrate IMP3 expression could predict unfavorable prognosis NB patient independent biomarkers . Targeting IMP3 expression NB cell line suppress cell invasion ability , suggest IMP3 could prognostic factor , also potential therapeutic target NB .</brief_summary>
