	<brief_summary>In-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) human oocytes follow replacement embryo uterine cavity become well establish treatment female infertility attributable damage fallopian tube , endometriosis unexplained cause alternative form therapy fail . The commonly used protocol follicular stimulation employ follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) long-acting agonist gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) prevent occurrence mid-cycle luteinizing hormone ( LH ) surge ensure induction well-synchronized large cohort ovarian follicle . The result number study demonstrate majority clinical situation , FSH administration alone sufficient achieve successful follicular development . A study show subject receive recombinant human-follicle stimulate hormone ( r-hFSH ) recombinant human-luteinizing hormone ( r-hLH ) , pregnancy rate similar young old age group , however , woman receive r-hFSH alone , significant decline pregnancy rate woman 35 old . This particular study also go show subgroup woman 35 old , may benefit supplementary r-hLH . A number study conduct assess safety efficacy r-hLH administer concomitantly r-hFSH presence develop follicle reduce rate growth intermediate small follicle allow dominant follicle continue progress . This Phase III , open-label , multicentre study evaluate safety efficacy addition Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone ( Luveris ) standard assist reproductive technology ( ART ) protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Luteinizing hormone heterodimeric glycoprotein compose non-covalent association α β subunit . Prior generation human-LH ( hLH ) recombinant technology , hLH available therapeutic use human menopausal gonadotropin ( hMG ) , co-extracted , purified preparation hLH hFSH urine post menopausal woman . Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone ( Luveris ) find well tolerate human pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study dose 40,000 IU healthy female volunteer without Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) experience report . OBJECTIVES - To evaluate safety efficacy addition Recombinant Human-Luteinizing Hormone ( Luveris ) standard ART procedure . In study , subject first treat GnRH agonist induce pituitary desensitization accord centre 's standard practice follow administration r-hFSH . All subject treat Recombinant Human -Luteinizing Hormone ( Luveris ) 150 IU per day subcutaneous ( s.c. ) Day 6 stimulation ART treatment cycle , continue dose injection hCG upto include day last FSH dose .</detailed_description>
