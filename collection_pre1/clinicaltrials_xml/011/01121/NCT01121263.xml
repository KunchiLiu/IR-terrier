	<brief_summary>The purpose study get good understanding patient multi-vessel coronary artery disease ( blockages one vessel bring blood heart ) either Hybrid Coronary Revascularization [ HCR ] ( combination surgery catheter procedure open clog heart artery ) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention [ PCI ] ( catheter procedure open clog heart artery ) . Participation study last 21 month patient 's heart procedure ( ) . The study collect information medical care patient receive plan procedure ( ) well follow procedure ( ) . No new testing procedure do . Patients receive test procedure doctor already plan . The information collect help plan design pivotal comparative effectiveness study hybrid revascularization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The increase prevalence coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , advance coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , concomitant medical therapy , cost revascularization result rise interest regard appropriate indication coronary revascularization . For patient 3-vessel disease , revascularization CABG recently rat appropriate revascularization PCI rat uncertain . Ideally , physician would like offer multi-vessel CAD patient truly seek : solution provide safe , minimally invasive treatment compromise long term durability survival . Integrating positive feature PCI CABG fundamental rationale `` hybrid '' coronary revascularization . Hybrid Coronary Revascularization ( HCR ) ( intend combination CABG PCI ) scientifically validate approach would major healthcare impact . The ability deliver new therapy CAD provide durability , without obligatory trauma prolong recovery time characteristic conventional CABG would major advance field cardiovascular medicine . Candidates HCR would particularly advantageous would several subgroup CAD patient increase number : elderly , patient high predict risk mortality and/or morbidity CABG , deconditioned patient patient significant disability patient treatment durability important , significantly invasive approach option . Moreover , HCR likely bridge divide treatment philosophy approach exist cardiologist cardiac surgeon . Collaboration rather competition specialty ultimately benefit patient , hospital , payer healthcare provider . The Hybrid Revascularization Observational Study multi-center observational study plan grant explore target population Hybrid Coronary Revascularization ( HCR ) , outcomes , variation specific way patient manage , order inform design pivotal comparative effectiveness trial emerge therapeutic strategy . Given observational nature study , HCR PCI group ' baseline characteristic event rate directly comparable ; rather , result intend inform design large , randomize pivotal trial . The study design two phase : Cohort 1 , capture demographic , angiographic , practice pattern data 6,669 consecutively screened patient ; Cohort 2 capture demographic , angiographic , practice pattern , outcome data 298 patient underwent either HCR PCI DES ( 90 also part Cohort 1 ) .</detailed_description>
