	<brief_title>Epigenetic Modulation Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma Marginal Zone Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , non-randomized , un-blinded , phase 2 efficacy trial use Immunomodulatory derivative thalidomide ( IMiD™ ) compound hypomethylating agent epigenetic target therapy patient relapsed/refractory follicular marginal zone lymphoma . There two part trial . Each patient progress part study . Part 1 : Sequential single agent therapy azacitidine lenalidomide . Each agent give four-six 28-day cycle . Subjects less complete response ( CR ) 4 cycle study drug Part 1a 1b proceed next study drug ( ) prescribe washout period . Subjects CR may receive 6 cycle study drug receive next study drug ( ) evidence progressive disease . There 1-6 week 'washout ' period stop start agent Part 1 , unless rapid progression suggest hold therapy would patient 's best interest . There washout period require Part 1 Part 2 . Part 2 : Combination therapy azacitidine lenalidomide give 28-day cycle 13 cycle subject stable disease well .</detailed_description>
