	<detailed_description>Obesity epidemically prevalent major risk factor chronic disease make fundamental understand pathway control food intake . During course meal afterwards gut brain communicate control full eater feel thus control amount food eaten . The information relay gut brain regard ingested nutrient increase importance understand mechanisms nutrient molecule initially detect gut signal brain influence food intake critical development novel food product could induce fullness reduce food consumption . Increasing understanding nutrient sense gut may influence subsequent food intake provide promising target obesity prevention treatment . Recent discovery show sweet taste receptor similar locate tongue present gut . It suggest thesis receptor involve way nutrient sense may play important role appetite control food intake .</detailed_description>
