	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study evaluate safety clinical effectiveness use physician-directed , patient self-management system , guide leave atrial pressure measurement , use patient heart failure . The system allow patient adjust HF medication daily base physician-directed prescription plan current HF status , similar manner diabetes patient manage insulin therapy . The goal LAPTOP-HF study demonstrate reduction episodes worsen heart failure ( HF ) hospitalization patient manage left atrial pressure ( LAP ) management system ( treatment group ) versus receive current standard care ( control group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Pressure Monitoring Optimize Heart Failure Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Sponsor believe direct measurement heart may provide accurate , reliable medically acceptable way well manage heart failure prior notice symptom hospitalize . This may enable doctor take preventative measure , fine tune care include frequently adjust medication goal avoid hospitalization .</detailed_description>
