	<detailed_description>Parkinson Disease ( PD ) neurodegenerative , progressive illness . It multi-system disease influence motor also cognitive autonomic system . The main cognitive impairment individual PD find executive function ( EF ) . EF define set cognitive skill necessary planning , monitor execute sequence complex activity . Previous study reveal relation cognitive state physical function healthy adult . Few study examine effect computer-based cognitive training various population . These study show positive emotional-cognitive effect population . This type intervention plan also apply PD patient . However , report effect intentional cognitive training gait function . The purpose study ass whether cognitive training , design improve EF ability , also improve gait function PD patient .</detailed_description>
