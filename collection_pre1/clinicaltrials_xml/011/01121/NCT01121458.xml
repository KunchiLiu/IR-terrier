	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rare blood vessel disorder lung pressure pulmonary artery ( PA ) rise normal level may become life threaten . PAH frequently misdiagnosed often progress late stage time accurately diagnose . PAH historically chronic incurable poor survival rate . However , new treatment available significantly improve prognosis . Right-heart catheterization ( RHC ) accurate useful test PAH , test directly measure pressure inside PA . It perform patient least , get definitive diagnosis PAH . The commonly used medication purpose intravenous nitroprusside , however medication 25-30 % patient well tolerate cause fast heart rate , well tolerated patient pulmonary hypertension and/or heart failure . The CARVE study ass effect Clevidipine , ultra-short act vasoselective calcium antagonist , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) utility pulmonary vasoreactivity test right heart catheterization ( RHC ) patient pulmonary hypertension ( PAH ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CARVE Phase 4 open-label descriptive observational trial PAH patient undergo invasive vasoreactivity test cath lab Dallas VA Medical Center . Patients clinically indicate RHC assessment pulmonary artery vasoreactivity enrol meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . The study involve follow test : 1 . Performance clinically indicate RHC assessment pulmonary hypertension pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) . 2 . Performance clinically indicate pulmonary vasoreactivity assessment IV Nitroprusside ( standard care ) 3 . For patient responsive Nitroprusside , inconclusive result intolerability Nitroprusside , pulmonary vasoreactivity assessment study drug ( IV ) conduct .</detailed_description>
