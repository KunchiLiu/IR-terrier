	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether crosslinked Marathon standard Enduron polyethylene liner show difference bone loss around hip implant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Marathon Polyethylene Enduron Polyethylene Acetabular Liners Used Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several institution report low wear rate highly crosslinked polyethylene base early clinical data . However , since bone loss typically appear 5-year follow-up , reduction incidence extent bone loss among total hip replacement patient crosslinked Marathon liner , compare standard Enduron liner , dramatic wear reduction . Despite substantial reduction wear observe 5-year follow-up , patient ' perception outcome remain similar among Marathon Enduron group . This study evaluate outcome minimum 10-years surgery among group patient whose outcome previously report 5-year follow-up . At 10-year follow-up , anticipate reduction wear associate Marathon polyethylene associate significant reduction bone loss compare Enduron polyethylene .</detailed_description>
