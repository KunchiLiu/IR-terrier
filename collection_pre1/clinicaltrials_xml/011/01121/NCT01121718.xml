	<brief_summary>This study try define appropriate dose investigational drug indocyanine green ( ICG ) combination near infrared ( NIR ) image use future study . ICG dye use since 50 , approve test liver function measure blood flow heart . It use study map lymphatic pathway lung breast cancer information study suggest may help identify lymph node associate melanoma . ICG detect within body use near-infrared light camera . In study investigator look easily ICG get first lymph node ( sentinel lymph node [ SLN ] ) associate melanoma , whether investigator see path ICG SLN use near infrared camera , dose ICG work best . While current method SNL mapping , know lymphoscintigraphy , effective provide small amount radiation . This study compare investigator result standard procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At time surgery , undergo lymphoscintigraphic procedure standard care patient melanoma . You also receive dose ICG mixed human serum albumin . This administer four small injection immediately around tumor tumor scar already remove . Pictures ICG solution take NIR camera progression dye along lymphatic channel tumor SLN monitor . As lymph node remove , picture take see ICG dye enter colored node . We compare technique result lymphoscintigraphy measure accuracy . Patients follow least one hour post injection adverse event . The patient take study . The result intervention subsequently analyze .</detailed_description>
