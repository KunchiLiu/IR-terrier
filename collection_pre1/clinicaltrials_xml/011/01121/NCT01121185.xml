	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether human monoclonal antibody Hepatitis C ( MBL-HCV1 ) effective prevent detectable level Hepatitis C virus patient undergo liver transplantation due chronic HCV infection . The study also determine MBL-HCV1 effective delay reduce amount detectable HCV patient transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Infected Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation Evaluate Human Monoclonal Antibody Against Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo control study Hepatitis C ( HCV ) infect patient undergo liver transplantation . Chronically infected patient HCV genotype 1a schedule receive liver transplant either decease living donor satisfy study inclusion exclusion criterion approach participate . The study conduct two part test human monoclonal antibody Hepatitis C ( MBL-HCV1 ) . In Part 1 , sixteen eligible patient randomize 1:1 receive 50 mg/kg MBL-HCV1 0.9 % sodium chloride placebo intravenously . Eleven dos give first 14 day post transplantation . Patients evaluate day 56 safety clinical outcome include measurement anti-HCV antibody , anti-drug antibody HCV viral load . On study visit day 42 , liver biopsy perform evaluation hepatitis . Physical examination , vital sign measurement , emergence adverse event concomitant medication usage assess schedule visit need 56 day study period . The Data Safety Monitoring Board perform futility analysis first 16 patient enrol complete study follow-up study visit day 42 post transplant . Based result interim analysis , dose MBL-HCV1 part 2 study determine . Part 2 study conduct manner Part 1 .</detailed_description>
