A male female , include : 8 11 week age time first vaccination subject &lt; 6S &lt; 6NS group 7 11 month time first vaccination subject 711S 711NS group 12 23 month time first vaccination subject 1223S 1223NS group ( Note second dose administered 23 Months age late allow , need , compliance National Recommendations administration 23valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine child SCD 24 month age ) . Written informed consent , sign thumb print , obtain parent ( ) /LAR ( ) subject . Where parent ( ) /LAR ( ) illiterate , consent form countersign witness . Additional inclusion criterion child SCD ( &lt; 6S , 711S 1223S group ) : Children diagnosis sickle cell disease [ homozygous sickle cell disease ( hemoglobin SS disease ) , double heterozygous sickle hemoglobin C disease ( hemoglobin SC disease ) sickle ßthalassemias ] confirm hemoglobin status hemoglobin chromatography electrophoresis ( &lt; 6S group ) electrophoresis ( 711S 1223S group ) . Free know suspected health problem ( establish medical history clinical examination enter study ) , would contraindicate initiation routine immunization outside clinical trial context Additional inclusion criterion healthy child ( &lt; 6NS , 711NS 1223NS group ) : Healthy subject establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Children negative diagnosis sickle cell disease confirm hemoglobin status hemoglobin chromatography and/or electrophoresis . Child care Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study vaccine ( ) within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug since birth . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day , equivalent . Inhaled topical steroid allow . Planned administration/administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day dose study vaccine end 30 day . Locally recommended vaccine ( recommended EPI program national immunization campaign ) example inactivated influenza vaccine always allow , even concomitantly administer study vaccine , document eCRF . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational product ( pharmaceutical product device ) . Previous vaccination plan vaccination study pneumococcal vacccine . History reaction hypersensitivity likely exacerbate component vaccine ( ) . Major congenital malformation . History neurological disorder seizure . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product since birth plan administration study period . Birth weight 1500g . Serious chronic illness SCD . Acute disease and/or fever time enrolment . Fever define temperature ≥ 37.5°C oral , axillary tympanic setting , ≥ 38.0°C rectal setting . The preferred route record temperature study tympanic . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhoea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever may , enrol discretion investigator . Additional exclusion criterion child SCD ( &lt; 6S , 711S 1223S group ) : • Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , ( include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection ) SCD related condition , base medical history physical examination ( laboratory testing require ) . Additional exclusion criterion healthy child ( &lt; 6 NS , 711NS 1223NS group ) : • Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , base medical history physical examination ( laboratory testing require ) .</criteria>
