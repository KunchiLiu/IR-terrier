	<brief_title>RO4929097 Treating Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Epithelial Ovarian Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumor activity RO4929097 recurrent / metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer primary peritoneal cancer progression free survival rate end 4 cycle . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess antitumor activity RO4929097 secondary endpoint include : overall response rate CA125 response rate ( GCIC criterion ) . II . To assess safety single agent RO4929097 advance platinum resistant ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . III . To explore expression Notch biomarkers advance platinum resistant ovarian , fallopian , primary peritoneal cancer . IV . To explore impact RO49097 ascitic fluid circulate tumor cell . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor tissue sample collect correlative study . Ascitic fluid may also collect . After completion study therapy , patient follow every month least 1 year .</detailed_description>
