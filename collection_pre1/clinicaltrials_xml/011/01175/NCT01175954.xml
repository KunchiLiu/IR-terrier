	<detailed_description>The investigator examine group patient partial epilepsy ( chronic seizure arise one particular part brain ) whose seizure control .

They receive new anti-epileptic drug , lacosamide , add whatever epilepsy medication currently take . They closely follow 24 week regular doctor 's visit monitor physical health seizure control , complete inventory assess frequency severity seizure . During period time , medication remain unchanged . At end 24-week period re-take battery cognitive test mood quality life inventory . The cognitive , mood , quality life variable analyze determine change well bad course lacosamide treatment . Any change also analyze respect seizure frequency severity adverse event side effect addition lacosamide , well lacosamide dosage . The investigator choose design since closely represent investigator clinical practice .</detailed_description>
