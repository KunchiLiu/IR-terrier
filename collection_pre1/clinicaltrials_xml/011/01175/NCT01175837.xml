	<brief_title>Short-Term Fasting Before Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety feasibility short-term fasting prior administration chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate weight change patient expose short-term fasting prior chemotherapy . II . Get preliminary estimate long feasible fasting period prior chemotherapy . III . Evaluate toxicity profile systemic chemotherapy treatment patient undergo short-term fasting prior treatment . IV . Investigate change plasma glucose , insulin , Insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) IGF-1binding protein ( BP ) patient undertake short-term fasting . OUTLINE : COHORT I : Patients fast 24 hour day 1 course 2 chemotherapy . If fast well tolerate , patient may escalate fast 12 hour subsequent course chemotherapy 3 course absence unacceptable toxicity . COHORT II : Patients fast long fast regimen find safe tolerable cohort I day 1 course course chemotherapy 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
