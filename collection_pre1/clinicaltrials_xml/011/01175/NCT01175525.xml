	<brief_summary>Mastocytes proven central rule development lipoid plaque vascular system . Mastocytes also important role stabilisation plaque build brain barrier . Different animal study show inhibition mastocyte activity decrease significantly risk secondary bleeding post ischaemic stroke.It also show post stroke inflammation process also block inhibition mastocytes.Other study show 100 % decrease brain barrier disruption post stroke oedema , treatment mastocyte inhibitor . Cromolyn synthetic drug anti-allergic effect inhibition mastocytes . This drug well know , safe drug main sub-substance use previously mention study .</brief_summary>
