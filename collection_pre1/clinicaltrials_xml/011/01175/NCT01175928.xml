	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy NormaTec PCD , non-invasive pneumatic compression device patent peristaltic pulse pneumatic waveform , treatment Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy ( DPN ) . The study compare treatment NormaTec PCD sham device ass whether NormaTec PCD improve sign symptom DPN .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes frequently lead decreased sensation leg cause diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . DPN important risk factor development foot ulceration , one common cause hospital admission lower-limb amputation among diabetic patient . However , date medication currently approve Food Drug Administration treat DPN . The goal research project assess effectiveness non-invasive , patented peristaltic pulse pneumatic compression device ( NormaTec PCD ) home treatment program improve symptom DPN ( e.g . numbness , pain , tingle leg ) underlie function nerve leg ( determined sensory perception assessment Nerve Conduction Studies test ) . In prospective , randomize , double-blind study , subject randomly place one two group : control group use sham NormaTec PCD ( `` placebo '' ) ; experimental group use NormaTec PCD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient diagnose type 1 type 2 diabetes Patient diagnose distal symmetric polyneuropathy ( DPN ) attributable diabetes A1C â‰¤ 11 % Abnormal peroneal motor nerve conduction study CMAP amplitude le 4 mV bilaterally . Refuses consent Unlikely compliant research protocol judge clinical investigator Neuropathy document cause something diabetes Medication neuropathic pain initiate within previous 3 month ( avoid confounding result study ) Medication glucose control change within previous 3 month ( avoid confounding result study ) Documented DVT within previous 3 month ( since acute DVT contraindication Pneumatic Medicine treatment ) Significant hepatic disease judge clinical investigator ( might cause neuropathy unrelated diabetes ) Documented cancer treatment within past 5 year ( might cause neuropathy unrelated diabetes ) History exposure neurotoxins heavy metal ( might cause neuropathy unrelated diabetes ) Documented alcohol drug abuse ( might cause neuropathy unrelated diabetes ) Documented major psychiatric disorder ( could contribute nonadherence protocol ) Presence major low extremity amputation ( since unable perform bilateral distal sensory perception test foot NCS peroneal motor nerve ) Significant peripheral arterial disease define anklebrachial index ( `` ABI '' ) &lt; 0.6 ( avoid critical limb ischemia thus high likelihood patient require major amputation near future drop study ) Severe low extremity edema judge clinical investigator ( order confound result ) End stage DPN peroneal motor nerve conduction result legs show Amplitude = 0 mV Currently participate another clinical trial</criteria>
