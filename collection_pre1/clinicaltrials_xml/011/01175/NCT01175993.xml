	<brief_summary>Background : - Traumatic brain injury may range effect , severe permanent disability subtle functional cognitive deficit often go undetected initial treatment . To improve treatment therapy provide uniform quality care , research need different treatment traumatic brain injury . - Exercise show improve movement balance people stroke , cerebral palsy , condition affect brain , improve symptom memory problem depression . Bright light therapy also show improve mood people depression . Researchers interested study problem movement , balance , think , mood people traumatic brain injury . By compare effect exercise bright light exposure brain function , new treatment may develop acute traumatic brain injury . Objectives : - To compare effect exercise bright light therapy brain function individual traumatic brain injury . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 44 year age either diagnose traumatic brain injury healthy volunteer . Design : - Individuals traumatic brain injury four outpatient evaluation visit clinical center , 3-month home exercise program , 3-month bright light exposure program home . Healthy volunteer one evaluation visit clinical center . - At first study visit , participant full physical examination medical history . Individuals traumatic brain injury also eye exam determine safe receive light therapy . - All participant follow initial test : - Tests walk movement , include monitor physical therapist ; test record joint movement evaluate muscle function ; test combine movement , thinking , speaking ; balance reaction time test . - Magnetic resonance imaging scan - Tests think mood , include questionnaire , computerized test , simple action test . - Participants traumatic brain injury separate 3-month session exercise bright light therapy , additional evaluation visit 3-month session end study . Between 3-month session , participant 1 month intervention . - Exercise session involve regular workout elliptical machine 30 minute 5 day week , bright light therapy session involve sit front light box 30 minute 5 day week . Participants keep journal monitor effect therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We : 1 ) compare performance healthy volunteer ambulatory adult traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) range motor , neurobehavioral brain imaging outcome ; 2 ) evaluate effect rapid , reciprocal arm leg exercise elliptical trainer high-level motor coordination balance , neurobehavioral cognitive functioning person TBI . Brain connectivity change connectivity response intervention quantify . We hypothesize even highly functional adult TBI poorer score measure control ; exercise lead significant improvement motor performance balance , neurobehavioral cognitive functioncompared equivalent length time participate training . We hypothesize improvement cortical connectivity representation relate directly functional one . Study Population : 80 adult ( 50 TBI ) recruit 20 TBI 20 healthy volunteer complete study . Only TBI group receive intervention . Design : Healthy control single assessment include motor , neuropsychological brain imaging test . Participants TBI 3 visit motor , neuropsychological brain imaging test healthy control . They perform 2 month fast elliptical training . . Assessments occur 0 , 2 , 4 month . The exercise device elliptical trainer exercise legs arm emphasis maintain fast speed . Mild resistance provide initially progressively increased speed optimize . . The training perform home 5 day per week 30 minute . Outcome Measures : Performance complex motor balance task assess 3D motion capture &amp; EMG , Smart Balance Measurement System High Level Mobility Assessment Tool ( Hi-MAT ) . Primary outcome Hi-MAT score , reaction time balance test Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( Ham-D ) . Secondary outcome include measure motor speed reaction time , dual task performance , memory , anxiety , sleep quality , responses stress . Cortical connectivity quantify use rest state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) , evaluate white matter tract . Cortical activation pattern imagine walk quantified fMRI .</detailed_description>

A ventriculoperitoneal shunt Have claustrophobia comfortable small enclose space . metal body would make MRI scan unsafe : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion device , cochlear ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( nitroglycerine ) , metallic implant object , body pierce remove , bone joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt , cerebral aneurysm clip , shrapnel metal embed ( war wound accident previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near eye ) . If question metal object present body , ask study doctor . Excessive startle reaction fear loud noise You able fit scanner</criteria>
