	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Immunogenicity Live Attenuated Virus Vaccine Prevention H2N3 Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Animal influenza virus , H1N1 H5N1 virus , typically infect animal like bird pig , virus also infect human . The recent outbreak H1N1 influenza virus demonstrate possible virus cause pandemic outbreak human . Researchers specifically interest evaluate vaccine H2 virus , virus cause pandemic outbreak human late 1950s 1960s . In addition , half world 's current population previous exposure relate virus , mean pandemic outbreak could pose serious health risk many people would immunity virus . In 2006 , outbreak H2N3 infection occur pig Midwest United States . While human contract virus outbreak , remain concern researcher event virus ever spread human . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity two dos experimental H2N3 vaccine , H2N3 MO 2006/AA ca healthy adult . This live attenuated vaccine , mean participant expose small amount H2N3 vaccine virus need remain isolated least 12 day receive vaccine prevent spread virus others . This study enroll healthy adult . Participants receive two dos vaccine , 4 week apart , stay isolation facility 12-day vaccination period . Participants admit isolation facility 2 day receive first vaccination . They receive one nasal spray administration vaccine monitor side effect . On various day isolation facility , undergo physical exam , blood urine collection , nasal wash procedure . Participants remain isolation facility least 9 day receive vaccine possibly longer , nasal wash test negative vaccine virus 2 consecutive day . Participants readmitted isolation facility 26 day first vaccination . They receive second vaccination study procedure repeat . Participants attend study visit 56 , 82 , 208 day first vaccination follow-up health safety monitoring , blood collection , nasal wash procedure .</detailed_description>
