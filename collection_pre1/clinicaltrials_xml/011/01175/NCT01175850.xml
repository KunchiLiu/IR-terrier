	<brief_summary>The objective Study evaluate safety efficacy IN.PACT Admiral® drug coat PTA balloon , utilized dilatation narrow section artery , compare standard ( non drug coat ) PTA balloon . The IN.PACT Admiral , besides mechanical dilatation effect typical PTA balloon , release drug ( paclitaxel ) balloon surface vessel wall . This drug absorption intend limit chance entity artery re-narrowing time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The efficacy IN.PACT Admiral balloon evaluate assess primary patency rate treat artery thighs patient include Study . Primary patency measure durability 1 year free lumen artery restore procedure base : - need re-dilatation previously treat vessel segment - ultrasound examination The safety IN.PACT Admiral assess evaluate incidence death , amputation re-dilatation pre-treated artery patient include Study . The IN.PACT SFA Trial enrol 2 phase : IN.PACT SFA I IN.PACT SFA II . The 150-patient IN.PACT SFA I phase intended support second phase IN.PACT SFA II IDE trial congruent design protocol . Aggregate data two phase intend provide statistical power 12-month primary safety effectiveness endpoint .</detailed_description>
