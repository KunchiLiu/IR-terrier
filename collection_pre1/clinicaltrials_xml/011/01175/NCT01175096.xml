	<brief_summary>RAD001 continue investigate anticancer agent new indication neuroendocrine tumor ( incl . carcinoid ) , breast cancer , liver cancer , gastric cancer lymphoma base potential act : - directly tumor cell inhibit tumor cell growth proliferation - indirectly inhibit angiogenesis lead reduced tumor vascularity ( via potent inhibition tumor cell HIF-1 activity VEGF production VEGF-induced proliferation endothelial cell ) A role RAD001 combination Sandostatin LAR® Depot treatment advance carcinoid tumor suggest data regulatory role mTOR cell growth protein translation find somatostatin-induced growth arrest mediate part inhibition PI3K pathway ( Charland , et al . 2001 ) . The present study design collect safety/tolerability data evidence efficacy RAD001 medically highly unmet indication advance pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor Chinese patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Profile RAD001 Daily Chinese Patients With Advanced Pulmonary Neuroendocrine Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose phase I b study characterize safety , tolerability , efficacy 10 mg RAD001 administer orally continuous once-daily dose regimen treatment advance pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor . The neuroendocrine tumor arise bronchus lung account 30 % carcinoid tumor , lot well differentiate adenocarcinoma , squamous cancer large cell lung cancer significant neuroendocrine carcinoma characteristic seem similarly prognosis carcinoid tumor . There effective treatment available advanced pulmonary NETs time . The rationale study base preclinical clinical consideration . IGF-1 known autocrine regulator CgA secretion cell growth human neuroendocrine tumor cell ( von Wichert , et al . 2000 ; Wulbrand , et al . 2000 ; Van Gompel Chen 2004 ) . A role RAD001 monotherapy carcinoid pancreatic NET suggest regulatory role mTOR cell growth , metabolism protein translation ( Fingar Blenis 2004 ; Vignot , et al . 2005 ) Novartis observation PI3K/mTOR pathway activate IGF-1 carcinoid pancreatic NET cell ( von Wichert , et al . 2000 ; Van Gompel Chen 2004 ) . The propose RAD001 dosage regimen 10 mg/day monotherapy combination therapy setting . This regimen base Novartis Phase I/II study result investigator-sponsored study NET . Initial Phase I study RAD001 10 mg/day schedule demonstrate dose limit toxicity 2 12 patient . Tolerability schedule verify total 33 patient Phase 1 study well 12 breast cancer patient treat letrozole 2.5 mg plus RAD001 10 mg/day . Pharmacodynamic model indicates downstream effector mTOR completely suppress RAD001 10 mg/day dose . No increased toxicity expect use RAD001 combination Sandostatin LAR® Depot . The investigator-sponsored study NET , toxicity observe RAD001 5 mg/day combination Sandostatin LAR® Depot similar observe RAD001 5 mg/day alone Phase 1 study ( Yao , et al . 2006 ) . Therefore dose RAD001 10 mg/day evaluate study .</detailed_description>
