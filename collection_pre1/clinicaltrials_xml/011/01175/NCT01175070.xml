	<detailed_description>Diabetic macular oedema : A combination increase longevity increase obesity cause rise incidence diabetes associate complication diabetic retinopathy . Almost patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) develop sign retinopathy approximately 60 % patient type 2 DM develop diabetic retinopathy . Of type 2 DM , diabetic macular oedema ( DME ) common cause reduce visual acuity . [ 1 ] DME one lead cause loss vision people work age develop world . It affect function macula , key part retina use central vision . In DME abnormal structural change blood vessel wall lead leakage fluid proteins blood vessel . [ 2 , 3 ] DME classify ischaemic exudative , base dominant underlying problem . In ischaemic DME , main problem reduction blood flow macula cause reduced central vision swell retinal tissue area . [ 4 ] In exudative DME , excessive leakage fluid blood vessel around macula result thicken swell retina resultant reduction central vision . There often combination ischaemia exudation . Vascular endothelial growth factor : A chemical call vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) implicate potential cause abnormality see DME . It show modulate growth pattern blood vessel , tone permeability wall , cause white blood cell draw inner wall blood vessel . [ 5 , 6 ] The actual role play VEGF part dependent need tissue act . [ 5 ] Studies diseases eye involve abnormal development new blood vessel , neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) , demonstrated central role VEGF . It also implicate development problem associated central retinal vein occlusion ( CRVO ) DME . VEGF exist variety subtypes , call `` isoforms '' , describe number amino acid ( build block protein ) contains . The different VEGF isoforms distinct activity different site body various tissue . [ 7 ] This may part help explain VEGF able elicit variety function within blood vessel beyond . [ 5 ] A role VEGF inhibitor eye : Macugen [ TM ] ( OSI-Eyetech , Inc. Pfizer , Inc. ) , also know pegaptanib , drug ability block one isoforms VEGF call VEGF ( 165 ) , leave type VEGF unaffected [ 8 ] . It inhibit amount leakage fluid blood vessel wall . It demonstrate VEGF ( 165 ) alone mediate abnormal new blood vessel development eye , inactivation Macugen [ TM ] inhibit new vessel development observe patient neovascular AMD [ 8 ] without affect normal blood vessel development , support VEGF ( 121 ) isoform . In addition , animal model study show injection Macugen [ TM ] fluid back eye ( `` intravitreal injection '' ) inhibit even show sign reverse typical damage blood vessel occur diabetes . [ 9 ] These finding suggest intravitreal Macugen [ TM ] could provide safe effective treatment development abnormal new blood vessel eye diabetes-induced damage blood vessel retina . [ 6 ] They form basis randomize control trial examine efficacy Macugen [ TM ] therapy AMD DME . [ 8 ] Other inhibitor VEGF `` antiVEGF '' drug exist . These include Avastin [ TM ] ( bevacizumab , Genentech , Inc ) Lucentis [ TM ] ( ranibizumab , Genentech , Inc. ) bind inhibit VEGF isoforms , contrast Macugen [ TM ] specific VEGF ( 165 ) . To date , Macugen [ TM ] Lucentis [ TM ] receive regulatory approval treatment neovascular AMD . Increasingly antiVEGF drug examine see might play beneficial role ocular condition . The generalized leakage fluid tiny blood vessel ( `` capillary hyperpermeability '' ) see DME describe somewhat analogous leakage `` hyperpermeability '' see abnormal blood vessel ( choroidal neovascularisation ) associate AMD . [ 10 ] Therapeutic effect blockade VEGF ( 165 ) isoform previously demonstrate AMD demonstrate DME . That particular study , detail , specify degree macular ischaemia patient . Safety efficacy Macugen [ TM ] assess randomize , sham-controlled , double-masked , Phase 2 trial enrol 172 diabetic subject DME affect centre fovea . The participant individual best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) 20/50 20/320 study eye DME involve centre macula investigator judge laser photocoagulation ( present standard treatment clinically significant exudative DME ) could safely withhold 16 week . Intravitreal injection Macugen [ TM ] , sham injection , administer baseline every six week thereafter . At Week 36 , 0.3 mg Macugen [ TM ] significantly superior sham injection . The result suggest overall visual acuity ( VA ) gain well reduce risk VA loss eye DME treat intravitreal Macugen [ TM ] . The 0.3 mg dose seem efficacious dose study , due relatively small number participant study , author unable identify statistical difference different dos give . The author felt result consistent establish known effect selective blockade VEGF ( 165 ) bioactivity- decreased leakage blood vessel walls-and postulate suggest anti-permeability effect macula . Most adverse event transient , mild moderate severity , attribute injection preparation procedure , rather study drug . Macugen [ TM ] equally well tolerate systemically , apparent increase risk cardiac , ischaemic haemorrhagic adverse event . [ 11 ] Rates serious injection-related complication , notably infection inside eye ( endophthalmitis ) , within range historical benchmark injection eye associate severe visual loss . These preliminary finding provide evidence selective inhibition VEGF ( 165 ) may produce clinically meaningful statistically significant benefit treatment DME . Confirmation preliminary observation Macugen [ TM ] safety , patient tolerance , significant efficacy across broad spectrum patient DME require . [ 10 ] There grow body evidence [ 12 , 13 ] suggests may role antiVEGF drug , selective unselective , treatment wide range ocular condition cause development abnormal blood vessel , include exudative DME . [ 14 ] Results large , randomise , control trial need confirm early safety efficacy finding small , open-label prospective study . Laser photocoagulation treatment , however , remain current best treatment clinically significant exudative DME . The primary aim type laser treatment try stabilise vision rather improve . [ 15 ] In ischaemic diabetic maculopathy laser treatment option would expect make vision bad . There known effective treatment ischaemic DME , natural history gradual decline central vision . Ischaemia well known major factor development progression diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) . It may due part effect VEGF tone blood vessel wall narrow small blood vessel . Consequently study do try ass effect antiVEGF treatment retinal ischaemia . The result literature conflict . VEGF inhibitor retinal ischaemia : Neubauer colleague [ 16 ] show anti-VEGF drug Avastin [ TM ] , inhibit isoforms VEGF , cause reduction peripheral retinal ischaemia improvement visual acuity patient diabetic retinopathy . They investigate change central peripheral ischaemia intravitreal injection Avastin [ TM ] able demonstrate small series patient DR Avastin [ TM ] treatment improve peripheral ischaemia short term . They saw evidence increase ischaemia , might fear . Limitations study include small number patient short follow-up one administration . They believe observe reduction ischaemia make anti-VEGF therapy promise approach treatment DR , investigation longer follow-up time need . In contrast , single case report [ 17 ] demonstrate deterioration VA use Avastin [ TM ] chronic , refractory DME 58-year-old woman undergone multiple previous treatment include laser photocoagulation intravitreal triamcinolone ( steroid ) injection . The author felt use Avastin [ TM ] way exacerbate macular ischaemia disrupt already fragile perfusion status . It difficult attribute poor outcome fully antiVEGF drug , report highlight need examine effect antiVEGF ischaemic DME closely . Chung colleague [ 18 ] retrospectively analyse effect macular ischaemia outcome treatment DME Avastin [ TM ] . They collect data 59 eye 53 consecutive patient analyse preoperative imaging test ( fluorescein angiogram ) sign ischaemia . They divide patient two group , without sign ischaemia , order ass outcomes . 3 month treatment , group ischaemia show reduction visual acuity approximately 20/63 20/80 , whereas group without ischaemia show improvement visual acuity 20/100 20/80 . Nine 18 eye ( 50 % ) ischaemic group , 9 41 eye ( 21 % ) non-ischaemic group , experience visual loss &gt; or=1 line ETDRS chart ( P = 0.031 , Pearson chi-square test ) . Four eye ( 22 % ) ischaemic group , 2 eye ( 5 % ) non-ischaemic group , lose &gt; or=3 line ( P = 0.042 , Pearson chi-square test ) . Whilst data show poorer outcome patient macular ischaemia treat Avastin [ TM ] , compare without , show treatment Avastin [ TM ] compare would happen patient ' vision without treatment . As already discussed natural history ischaemic DME decline visual acuity currently establish treatment option . The investigator would expect patient ischaemic DME well without ischaemia tend much severe disease without ischaemia . In particular group appear baseline acuity much poor non-ischaemic group , give scope improvement visual acuity treatment non-ischaemic group , average , good visual acuity , probably much less oedema , begin . Macugen [ TM ] ischaemic DME : The investigator choose look Macugen [ TM ] specificity generally good safety profile validate &gt; 4 year . It possible non-selective VEGF inhibitor block VEGF isoforms could deleterious retinal function long term selective VEGF antagonist could spare several small soluble VEGF isoforms within eye . [ 19 ] No increase risk serious systemic adverse event show major clinical trial Macugen [ TM ] . [ 11 ] The incidence ocular adverse event use treat AMD low [ 20 ] . As discussed , Macugen [ TM ] use benefit exudative DME effectiveness ischaemic DME , currently available treatment , remain unknown . The investigator plan use Macugen [ TM ] treat 30 patient ischaemic DME . The investigator diagnose macular ischaemia assess size foveal avascular zone ( FAZ ) . This area centre macula . It usually devoid blood vessel order maximise visual clarity . The FAZ may abnormally enlarge irregular patient diabetes requirement diagnosis ischaemic DME . Enlargement FAZ think sign reduce blood flow , possibly related effect VEGF , associate reduced vision . Macugen [ TM ] give standard dose use treat AMD identify effective phase 2 study Macugen [ TM ] DME , i.e . 0.3mg . Our primary outcome change size FAZ secondarily would like look change thickness retina centre macula change visual acuity . The investigator hope pilot study clarify whether Macugen [ TM ] might able reverse effect VEGF ( 165 ) benefit ischaemic DME , severe end DME spectrum .</detailed_description>
