	<brief_summary>Management type 2 diabetes ongoing challenge patient doctor . In order prevent complication , patient need monitor control blood sugar level . In addition , may need ongoing communication doctor order modify treatment . In study investigator wish compare benefit continuous glucose monitor system ( CGMS ) internet-based glucose monitoring system ( IBGMS ) . The investigator also want determine whether frequency blood glucose test affect blood glucose control see whether benefit CGMS IBGMS independent test frequency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Monitoring Data Acquisition Utilization Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Treated With Insulin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current study , investigator wish test several hypothesis : whether frequency SMBG correlate HbA1c , whether knowledge strip count affect HbA1c , whether reduction HbA1c use IBGMS independent frequency test , whether difference IBGMS CGMS HbA1c reduction . The investigator recruit 100 patient type 2 diabetes satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion . For first visit , patient immediately randomize four group . One group test 3 time day ( SMBG ) . The second group similar SMBG group except know count frequency test ( SMBG With Knowledge ) . The third group use IBGMS fourth group use CGMS . During first visit , teach patient use program machinery group . All four group ask follow protocol visit doctor 3 month interval 6 month along complete laboratory blood test result . For SMBG SMBG With Knowledge group , give new meter ask test 3 time day . They also require keep diary SMBG level . The difference two SMBG With Knowledge group know count strip . The SMBG group believe test new meter know SMBG With Knowledge group exist . This deception necessary test experimental effect patient know count frequency testing , affect frequency test . The investigator tell SMBG group test accuracy new meter test 3 time day . For CGMS IBGMS group , also count frequency blood glucose test see whether benefit independent number test . Furthermore , wish compare two method blood glucose monitoring . Both group upload data onto internet communicate doctor every 2 week use secure online web site . At end 3 6 month , collect frequency test group determine whether increased glycemic control correlate increase test . We also collect SMBG diary see whether write data correlate data meter . The investigator also compare measure blood glucose level group determine effectiveness CGMS IBGMS .</detailed_description>
