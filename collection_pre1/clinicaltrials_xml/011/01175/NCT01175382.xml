	<brief_summary>The primary aim project evaluate effectiveness combine behavioral + drug therapy compare behavioral treatment alone drug therapy alone way improve outcome treatment OAB symptom men . We hypothesize combined therapy result well outcome either behavioral drug therapy alone . The second aim compare two method implement combined therapy : simultaneously initial therapy vs. step therapy , therapy combine follow initial behavioral drug therapy alone . The third aim examine cost cost-effectiveness combined behavioral + drug therapy compare behavioral drug therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Behavioral Drug Treatment Overactive Bladder Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) common , distress condition manifest bothersome symptom urgency , frequent urination , urge incontinence , nocturia , impact life million men . OAB symptom often treat pharmacologic therapy ( alpha-blocking agent and/or antimuscarinic agent ) behavioral treatment . Although drug therapy ( even combine drug therapy ) behavioral treatment reduce OAB symptom , patient completely cure either treatment alone . Therefore , need improve intervention common problem . The primary purpose study test effectiveness combine behavioral treatment drug therapy way improve outcome treatment OAB symptom men . This 3-site , 2-stage , 3-arm randomized clinical trial behavioral treatment , drug therapy , combine drug + behavioral therapy men OAB , examine efficacy combine therapy whether yield high success rate either therapy alone . 201 men OAB enrol randomized 1 ) drug therapy alone follow combined therapy , 2 ) behavioral treatment alone follow combined therapy , 3 ) combine therapy initial treatment .</detailed_description>
