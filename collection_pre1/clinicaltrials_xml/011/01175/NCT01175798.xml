	<brief_summary>Dialysis patient often suffer defect immune system ( part body fight infection ) . Evidence suggest Vitamin D deficiency may negative effect immunity , many dialysis patient deficient Vitamin D. We believe give Vitamin D dialysis patient deficient , may help improve immune system . This study test idea .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Vitamin D Repletion Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Innate adaptive immunity commonly impair patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) dialysis . The myriad immune defect patient , often attribute uremia , may account high risk bacterial infection suboptimal response vaccination . The mechanisms underlying abnormality immune function remain elusive , emerge evidence indicate 25OH-Vitamin D exert potent complex control innate adaptive immunity . Vitamin D deficiency common dialysis patient , immune effect associate 25OH-Vit D deficiency overlap find many dialysis patient . The kidney dominant site 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity require produce active 1,25OH-Vit D ; however , immune cell also express 1-alpha-hydroxylase enzyme . Evidence indicate effect Vitamin D modulate immunity require conversion 25OH-Vit D 1,25OH-Vit D within immune cell ( rather via circulate 1,25OH-Vit D ) . As consequence , total body deficiency 25OH-Vit D impact immune function despite ongoing therapy active 1,25OH-Vit D ( dialysis patient receive ) . Our preliminary data confirm high prevalence 25OH-Vit D deficiency dialysis patient show Th1 T cell alloimmunity strong patient deficient 25OH-Vit D , support hypothesis Vit D deficiency important immunological consequence . Based published literature preliminary data , hypothesize repletion 25OH-Vit D enhances immunity dialysis patient . To test hypothesis , propose randomize controlled trial oral 25OH-Vit D repletion patient population . One hundred fifty 25OH-Vit D deficient study subject randomize either treatment 50,000 IU oral 25OH-Vit D weekly treatment ( standard care ) . The primary outcome change 25OH-Vit D level measure 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month . Secondary outcome measure include change peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) profile flow cytometry 6 12 month , change ELISPOT-based panel reactive T cell ( PRT ) readout 6 12 month , change PMBC cytokine production response toll-like-receptor stimulation 6 12 month , response influenza vaccination .</detailed_description>
