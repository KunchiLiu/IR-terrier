	<brief_summary>Procalcitonin ( PCT ) one many inflammatory marker rise response infection . Many study show marker indicative patient 's clinical course comparison inflammatory marker , Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate ( ESR ) C reactive protein ( CRP ) , assess patient 's risk serious infection . A particular population potential serious infection patient fever central line , often secondary oncologic disease . These patient often neutropenic unable fight infection , thereby render extremely vulnerable rapid decline clinical status . By identify level procalcitonin significant threshold serious bacterial infection , investigator early identify sick patient could potentially worse clinical course and/or outcome . The primary study goal identify whether level procalcitonin exist rate bacteremia serious bacterial infection patient fever central line exist . The investigator try determine level PCT correlate bacterial infection line sepsis specific population patient often central line secondary oncologic process . The investigator propose theory since peak value PCT show elevate acute setting make useful tool particular population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Procalcitonin Levels Patients With Fever Central Line</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective study patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) fever central line procalcitonin level check , along CBC blood culture . Procalcitonin level record blood culture result follow see whether high procalcitonin level correlate great risk positive blood culture . A prospective study conduct patient fever central line present Emergency Department . Written inform consent obtain patient . We include patient 18 year age young exclude patient receive antibiotic within previous 24 hour present ED study show PCT level dramatically decrease institution antibiotic therapy . Patients identified presentation ED chief complaint `` Fever Central Venous Catheter '' . Diagnosis sepsis make clinical finding ( fever , chill , alter mental statusâ€¦ ) confirm laboratory finding ( leukocytosis leucopenia neutropenia , later positive blood culture ) . Management individual patient determine pediatric emergency medicine physician consult pediatric hematologist-oncologist , require case , intensivist . On presentation ED , patient CBC differential , blood culture central line procalcitonin level draw . All receive empiric antibiotic initiate either Ceftriaxone ( patient clinically stable non-neutropenic define Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500 cells/microliter ) Cefepime Gentamicin neutropenic ill appear patient . Electronic medical record review patient demographic , medical social history clinical presentation . Medical record admission use follow progression hospital stay well management use . Office record use post admission outcome . Levels PCT determine use Brahms Kryptor compact require minimum 200 microliters plasma , serum whole blood run PCT level could detect level low &lt; 0.02ng/ml within 20-25 minute . Levels report &lt; 0.05ng/ml consider indicative sepsis level &gt; 2 ng/ml indicative high sepsis probability . Levels 0.05 2 suggest repeat level drawn 24 hour .</detailed_description>
