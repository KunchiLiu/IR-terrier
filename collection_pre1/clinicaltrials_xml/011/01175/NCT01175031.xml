	<detailed_description>Study Objectives : To compare positive airway pressure ( PAP ) device 's detection respiratory event airway status device detect apneas event score simultaneous polysomnography ( PSG ) . Design : Prospective PSGs patient sleep apnea use new-generation PAP device . Settings : Four clinical academic sleep center . Patients : Forty-five patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) complex sleep apnea ( Comp SA ) perform PSG PAP level adjust induce respiratory event . Interventions : None .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female , age 2180 . Able willing provide write informed consent . Diagnosis complex sleep apnea ( CompSAS ) Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) within one year study participation . For participant CompSAS : ( ) Diagnostic PSG ApneaHyopnea Index ( AHI ) great equal 10 events/hour central apnea index ( CAI ) great equal 5 events/hour sleep ( b ) PAP titration CAI great equal 5 events/hour sleep . For participant OSA , diagnostic PSG AHI great equal 15 events/hour sleep . Must CPAP titration necessary PAP level treat sleep disorder breathe know . Agreement undergo fullnight , inlaboratory PSG CPAP device . Participation interventional research study within 30 day study participation . Premenopausal females know pregnant sexually active use reliable method birth control . Surgery upper airway , nose , sinus , middle ear within last 90 day . Surgery time treatment OSA uvulopalatopharyngoplasty ( UPPP ) . Major medical psychiatric condition would interfere demand study , adherence positive airway pressure , ability complete study .
