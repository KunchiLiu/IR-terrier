	<brief_summary>This study compare TNFE-NBI biopsy , DRE biopsy diagnostic evaluation stag patient suspicious UADT lesion . All patient enrol study undergo TNFE-NBI biopsy suspicious lesion prior plan regular clinical care ( DRE ) . Biopsies evaluate standard clinical method patient diagnosis care . As current standard care , biopsy give patient non-malignant , 3 month office visit arrange evaluate determine need intervention . At end study enrollment set biopsies re-evaluated blinded fashion surgical pathologist . Study assessment malignant vs. non-malignant ( benign ) pathology use see whether test tend agree diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single arm prospective study evaluate concordance standard-of-care diagnostic procedure TNFE-NBI diagnosing malignancy . The primary aim investigation determine whether TNFE NBI procedure detect stage cancer head neck well standard DRE require general anesthesia . Patients pending direct laryngoscopy present Department Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery UCSF UADT lesion ask participate study provide eligibility criterion meet . Under current standard-of-care diagnostic evaluation stag UADT lesion , patient undergo image study include CT and/or MRI neck contrast prior direct laryngoscopy . Study participant undergo TNFE NBI DRE procedure . The study procedure TNFE NBI perform , follow 1-6 week later DRE , standard approach diagnosis , without surgeon knowledge detail first procedure . The sequence examination investigation dictate need minimize mucosal trauma first examination allow mucosal heal prior second examination , thus randomize . TNFE-NBI produce much less mucosal trauma avoid direct blunt manipulation small , 1.8mm , cup biopsy forceps . Because possible TNFE NBI procedure might detect small tumor lesion different location , biopsy location TNFE NBI procedure make known end DRE surgery ensure need area biopsied . Therefore , secondary aim study explore whether TNFE NBI procedure may improve detection malignancy add DRE surgery . Patients enrol study undergo TNFE-NBI biopsy suspicious lesion . The TNFE-NBI examination digitally record . The examiner describe , use standard language diagram , anatomic location suspicious area reveal procedure . Biopsy tissue label area origin . In event participant tolerate TNFE-NBI , study procedure abort . At least one week 6 week TNFE-NBI , patient undergo standard care direct rigid endoscopy . The intervening time DRE allow recovery mucosal surface . Participants tolerate TNFE-NBI undergo DRE standard care . The DRE examiner blind area biopsied TNFE-NBI procedure completion standard care DRE examination tissue biopsy selection . In investigator 's experience , area prior biopsy apparent DRE examiner mucosal recovery occur 1-6 week elapse TNFE-NBI DRE . Upon completion standard care DRE examination tissue biopsy selection , DRE examiner open TNFE-NBI examiner 's note describe area deem suspicious TNFE-NBI . Additional area may examine biopsied DRE base TNFE-NBI note . Records keep anatomic area : 1. identified procedure , 2. identify DRE prompt TNFE-NBI note 3. identify DRE ( previously identify TNFE-NBI ) . A diagnosis carcinoma situ invasive squamous cell carcinoma consider positive malignancy . If diagnosis malignancy make initial endoscopy , regardless test positive , patient contact immediately appropriate treatment pursue . For diagnosis dysplasia non-malignant condition polyp , lymphoid tissue , papilloma , etc. , patient schedule follow-up . Routine follow-up benign lesion include routine head neck examination , include indirect laryngoscopy fiberoptic endoscope 2-3 month biopsy . New enlarge lesion assess operating room DRE per standard care . Lesions initially diagnose non-malignant stable visualize follow-up need re-biopsy per standard care . At conclusion study enrollment , biopsy specimen de-identified , batch , evaluated pathologist blind type endoscopy . A diagnosis carcinoma situ invasive squamous cell carcinoma consider positive malignancy . If patient non-malignant diagnosis study pathology ( TNFE-NBI DRE ) diagnose malignancy routine follow-up , study evaluation consider false negative . If malignancy develop within three month biopsy procedure , study evaluation consider true negative . ( This design represent compromise evaluate patient negative endoscopy . By necessity negative diagnosis one exclusion , give complete pathologic evaluation every patient ' upper aerodigestive tract neither ethical , practical , feasible clinical practice . Precedent design find Smith-Bindman , Chu et al . 2005 )</detailed_description>
