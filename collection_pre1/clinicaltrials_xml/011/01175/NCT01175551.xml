	<detailed_description>Preterm birth ( PTB ) currently important maternal child health problem United States . It lead cause neonatal mortality significant contributor neonatal morbidity . In United States , approximately 12 % live birth bear preterm , incidence continue rise . The extreme cost PTB reside immediate neonatal care also longterm care last morbidity result prematurity . Effective prevention treatment PTB could significantly lower neonatal mortality morbidity well health care cost . In United States , PTB cost order 28 billion dollar year . But , cost stop delivery . The cost prolong hospital care birth increase need hospital admission first year life ex-preterm infant significant confers large economic burden society . It well know PTB rate United States high Black infant ( 17.9 % ) , follow Native Americans ( 14 % ) , White infant ( 11.8 % ) , Asian infant ( 10 % ) . The specific large disparity black white infant strike etiology disparity fully understood . This disparity persist even adjust socioeconomic status . Maternal stress implicate potential cause PTB . Racism potent lifetime stressor live Black woman particular . It plausible perception racism well distrust health care system may explain persistent racial disparity PTB , especially mediation factor associate premature birth . The data date offer preventative strategy woman prior PTB . These woman represent small percent woman PTB . More half PTB occur apparently low risk pregnancy . Cervical shortening appear common biological pathway lead preterm birth , often well advance PTB . Regardless etiology PTB , cervical change must occur . The cervix must remodel ( change ) birth occur gestational age . We hypothesize experience discrimination health care system distrust associate preterm birth . Further , hypothesize premature cervical remodel occurs week prior actual birth may able detected woman high risk preterm birth ( nulliparous women-women previously carry pregnancy beyond 15 week ) . This study investigate whether experience discrimination health care system distrust associate PTB woman ( group 1 ) . It also investigate detection cervical remodeling ( change cervix measure protein level , ultrasound length physical exam ) accurately identify woman great risk PTB-nulliparous ( group 2 ) . A prospective cohort pregnant woman enrol . All enrol woman ask complete validated questionnaire experience discrimination health care system distrust . Nulliparous woman evaluate cervical change , comprehensive evaluation 18-24 week . The main outcome assess preterm birth .</detailed_description>
