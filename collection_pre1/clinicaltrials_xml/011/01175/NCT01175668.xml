	<brief_summary>The study plan compare use Clonidine versus Phenobarbital additional medication neonatal morphine sulfate treatment newborn infant undergoing drug withdrawal symptom due mother 's use opioid drug use . The investigator hypothesis use Clonidine lead shorter duration treatment , hospital stay thereby early discharge home .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clonidine Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) symptom complex experience 55 94 % neonate expose intrauterine opioids . Recent study show combination therapy superior monotherapy neonatal morphine sulfate ( NMS ) . Phenobarbital show reduce length hospitalization , decrease severity withdrawal , well decrease hospital cost care giver demand . Similarly , clonidine , α2-adrenergic receptor agonist , also show safe , effective reduces length treatment . Phenobarbital antiepileptic act GABA ( A ) receptor show animal model inhibit neuronal cell proliferation , survival neurogenesis . In human infant long term treatment phenobarbital may result neuro-developmental compromise . Due potentially harmful effect Phenobarbital ( P ) alternative therapy explore thoroughly include clonidine ( C ) . Our primary aim compare length NAS treatment NMS two study group - NMS/C versus NMS/P . Our secondary aim compare total dosage NMS , total length hospital stay NAS treatment , treatment failure adverse effect profile two study group . We hypothesize clonidine compare phenobarbital adjunct therapy , short length stay , few treatment failure side effect . Study design/Methods : This study prospective , randomize , non-blinded clinical trial NMS/C versus NMS/P treatment infant NAS . Infants recruit Baystate Children 's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) Neonatal Continuing Care Nursery ( NCCN ) , level III unit , 2 year study period . After randomization , infant adhere strict treatment initiation withdrawal protocol . Maternal infant descriptive data collect along specific data regard vital sign , drug dosage , length treatment , treatment failure adverse effect . The primary outcome length treatment NMS two study arm . The secondary outcome - ) total length hospital stay NAS treatment , b ) mean total treatment dose mean daily dose NMS , c ) total number treatment failure , ) adverse effect bradycardia , hypotension , hypertension e ) Total outpatient therapy day Phenobarbital Significance : This comparison study potentially great significance . If clonidine prove equally effective treatment NAS many detrimental effect phenobarbital therapy may avoid infant long term pharmacotherapy treatment withdrawal shorter length hospital stay .</detailed_description>
