	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether creatine helpful adjunctive treatment treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) female male Veterans . We hypothesize Veterans receive creatine show decrease depressive symptom measure Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . We also use 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31-P MRS ) brain scan compare level neurochemical relate energy metabolism brain , before-and-after treatment creatine , healthy control MDD participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creatine Augmentation Veterans With SSRI-Resistant Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label clinical trial investigational drug creatine augmentation treatment female male Veterans , age 18-55 , Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) fail respond antidepressant treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) drug . Based converge preclinical animal model research , laboratory 's prior clinical trial , hypothesize nutritional supplement creatine may provide benefit adjunctive treatment SSRI pharmacotherapy , Veterans treatment-resistant depression . Twenty ( n=20 ) Veterans age 18-55 year MDD recruit participation open-label trial creatine augmentation . Veterans depression unremitted MDD , despite adequate trial SSRI antidepressant . Participants MDD treat oral creatine 5 gm daily 8 week continue take SSRI antidepressant . Participants undergo brain scan baseline , scan repeat follow 8 adjunctive creatine . The neuroimaging technique utilized Phosphorus-31 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) . 31P-MRS non-invasive method exposure ionize radiation . At magnetic field strength utilized ( 3 Tesla ) , magnetic resonance image FDA-approved associate irreversible serious adverse event . Furthermore , 31P-MRS vivo method vivo quantification phosphorus energy metabolism , live human brain . In addition Veterans MDD , twenty ( n=20 ) healthy control ( HC ) participant recruit . HCs Veterans age 18-55 , history psychiatric substance use disorder . No treatment administer HC participant . The HCs undergo single 31P-MRS scan , use measure phosphorus-bearing neurometabolites involve brain energy metabolism . The research team use data 31P-MRS scan compare level high-energy phosphate metabolite MDD participant vs. healthy control . In addition , comparison pre- post-treatment 31P-MRS metabolite level conduct MDD participant , test hypothesis creatine augmentation improve brain energy metabolism .</detailed_description>
