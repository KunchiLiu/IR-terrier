	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Recurrent , Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy mean response rate ( base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 criterion ) vorinostat treatment patient locally advance , recurrent metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety tolerability vorinostat patient population . II . To assess time tumor response ( TTR ) . III . To assess response duration ( RD ) . IV . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) . V. To assess overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess association metabolic response positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) one cycle chemotherapy subsequent best tumor response accord standard anatomic response evaluation criterion ( RECIST ) . II . To assess association metabolic response PET/CT first second chemotherapy cycle PFS . III . To assess flow sort diploid , aneuploid , tetraploid population tumor cell formalin fix , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tissue block patient benefit suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) therapy patient demonstrate durable benefit . IV . Profile genome cell population use oligonucleotide comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) array . V. Perform whole exome analysis sort tumor population match germ line sample patient select . VI . To assess stable disease duration ( SDD ) . VII . To assess association response vorinostat treatment RAD23 homolog B ( HR23B ) tumor paraffin block . VIII . Retrospectively compare volumetric density ( viable tumor volume = VTV ) pre-determined RECIST target lesion cross section imaging ( CT/magnetic resonance [ MR ] ) already obtain . IX . Correlate VTV , RECIST treatment response ( partial response , stable disease , progressive disease stable disease 6 month ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow 180 day .</detailed_description>
