	<brief_title>Dilute Betadine Lavage Prevention Postoperative Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infections total knee arthroplasty still major source morbidity mortality Orthopaedics . They often necessitate long term antibiotic , reoperation , lead complication sepsis even death . Infection prevention remain one primary goal orthopedic surgeon . While source report infection rate primary total knee arthroplasty le 1 % , report rate infection revision total knee arthroplasty report high 5.6 % . Despite step take towards infection prevention proper administration preoperative antibiotic , strict adherence sterile method , meticulous sterile preparation surgical site ; infection remain high total knee revision arthroplasty patient population compare primary total knee arthroplasty . A dilute betadine lavage ( 0.35 % 1 % povidone iodine ) prior surgical closure show general surgical procedure well orthopaedic spine surgery reduce infection rate patient , examine total joint arthroplasty . The study enroll patient schedule undergo revision total knee arthroplasty . Patients randomize two group . The treatment group receive dilute betadine lavage prior surgical closure 3 minute follow 2000ml sterile saline irrigation control group receive 2000ml sterile saline lavage alone . All treatment standard care . Subjects follow one year post surgery infection , define Appendix 1 , interval 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , one year date surgery . During visit patient receive standard post operative care include infection screening . If infection clinically suspect symptom warmth erythema joint , reduce mobility joint , increase pain joint , infection data collect consist Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate , C-Reactive Protein level synovial fluid sample take white blood cell count bacterial culture .</detailed_description>
