	<brief_summary>OSPREY multi-center , single arm , non-randomized , prospective clinical trial . Subjects undergo superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) stent procedure use Misago™ Peripheral Self Expanding stent inclusion none exclusion criterion meet . The stent efficacy safety evaluate immediately post procedure , 30 day , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month post procedure . A subject consider enrol OSPREY study he/she sign inform consent meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . The study objective demonstrate efficacy safety novel stent design inferior historical Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty ( PTA ) stent outcomes meet performance goal publish objective performance goal Rocha-Singh , et al . This multi-center , single arm , non-randomized , prospective clinical trial Misago™ Self-Expanding Stent System treatment atherosclerotic stenosis occlusion SFA . The primary endpoint stent patency evaluate 12 month .</brief_summary>
