	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent , Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Metastatic Urinary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine time disease progression ( defined time diagnosis metastatic urothelial carcinoma first confirm progression disease ) patient locally recurrent , locally advanced , unresectable , metastatic urothelial cancer treat sunitinib malate ineligible cisplatin-based chemotherapy . - To determine safety drug patient . Secondary - To determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . - To determine overall response rate patient treat drug . - To determine overall survival patient treated drug . - To determine time treatment failure patient treat drug . - To determine pharmacodynamic profile drug pre- post-treatment serum tumor tissue ( i.e. , IL8 , VEGF , MMP9 , bFGF , p27 , Ki-67 , apoptosis [ H/E ] ) week 6 , possible , time progression . - To determine quality life patient treat drug use QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire ( EORTC QLQ-C30 ) , , end study treatment . Serum tumor tissue sample collect baseline study treatment pharmacodynamic study . Samples analyze marker ( i.e. , IL8 , VEGF , MMP9 , bFGF , p27 , Ki-67 , apoptosis [ H/E ] ) via immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 2 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
