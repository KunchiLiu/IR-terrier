	<brief_title>EGEN-001 Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month proportion patient objective tumor response ( complete partial ) patient persistent recurrent ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event assess National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect blood peritoneal lavage fluid patient stored future research . OUTLINE : Patients receive intraperitoneal EGEN-001 day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
