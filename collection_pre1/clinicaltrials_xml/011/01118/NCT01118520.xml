	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) balloon-like swelling body 's main blood vessel ( aorta ) course abdomen . As result National Aneurysm Screening programme many detect . Small AAAs grow slowly remain benign condition diameter exceed 2-3 time diameter normal aorta ( 5.5cm size ) , operative repair aneurysm recommend avoid potentially fatal event burst bleeding ( aneurysm rupture ) . It therefore important identify strategy prevent aneurysm growth . There suggestion use specific drug class , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , may reduce risk rupture large aneurysm . This trial ass whether ACE inhibitor ( perindopril ) aneurysm-related benefit , patient small AAAs screening centre London area . The effect perindopril versus placebo ( dummy ) AAA growth rate compare . In addition comparing effect perindopril effect equivalent blood pressure lower another non-ACE inhibitor class drug ( amlodipine ) aneurysm growth rate , see whether benefit perindopril simply result lower blood pressure . 225 Patients assign one 3 treatment chance ( randomisation ) .In addition analysis effect perindopril blood pressure lowering , effect treatment quality life assess . Patients return 3-monthly interval ultrasound scan blood pressure measurement , questionnaire regard quality life start end 2-year research period . An ultrasound scan painless test use sound wave create image organ structure inside body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effect Angiotensin-converting Enzyme ( ACE ) Inhibitors Small Aneurysm Growth Rate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial investigate idea ACE-inhibitor reduce abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) growth rate , pilot 3-arm randomise control trial ( i.e . study treatment choose random patient ) . The three intervention ACE-inhibition perindopril ; equivalent blood pressure reduction amlodipine ( calcium channel blocker ) placebo tablet . By compare effect perindopril amlodipine arm , design permit evaluation blood pressure independent effect perindopril . Pending result pilot trial , plan work local National Aneurysm Screening programme conduct large , definitive trial , investigate hypothesis blood pressure reduction ACE-inhibitor slow rate small AAA growth preferentially compare antihypertensive agent . Secondary research question trial effect perindopril therapy aneurysm-related death rate , diseases possibly cause AAA quality life compare similar blood pressure lower effect amlodipine placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All men woman , age 6085 year , AAA &lt; 5.5 cm systolic BP &lt; 150 mmHg eligible inclusion trial . For patient whose systolic BP &gt; 150 mmHg , treatment initiate diuretic Indapamide SR 1.5mgs principal investigator and/or amlodipine ( 5 mg daily ) initiate general Practitioner . If SBP subsequently fall &lt; 150 mmHg medication subject would eligible inclusion study . Patients already receive ACEinhibitor amlodipine 10mg daily . Patients know renal artery stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) . Patients convert diuretic therapy and/or low dos amlodipine . Those unable give inform consent frail travel 3monthly surveillance .</criteria>
