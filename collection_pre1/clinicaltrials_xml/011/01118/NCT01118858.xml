	<brief_summary>Cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) important enzyme body break many medication commonly use child various age . The purpose proposal investigate relative role development genetic variation CYP2D6 activity school-aged child adolescent attention deficit hyperactivity disorder health control use over-the-counter cough suppressant , dextromethorphan `` DM '' , standard probe determine CYP2D6 phenotype . Embedded study design sub-studies search by-product normal body metabolism reflect difference enzyme activity , pharmacokinetic study ass consequence CYP2D6 genetic variation systemic exposure medication use patient population . Ultimately , goal research personalize use medication child select appropriate dose correct medication individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This proposal represent continuation previous ongoing longitudinal study characterize relative contribution pharmacogenetics ontogeny variability CYP2D6 CYP3A4 activity birth adolescence . Specifically , overall goal research program test hypothesis genetic variability , rather ontogeny , primary source variability CYP2D6 CYP3A4 activity adolescence . This study extend current series longitudinal phenotyping study cross-sectional study child age 7-15 year , study seven occasion , 6 month apart . Children recruit Children 's Mercy Hospitals Clinics , The Children 's Mercy Hospital Northland Campus , The Children 's Mercy South Campus . Subjects participate study consist total 220 child adolescents 7 15 year age gender ethnic distribution representative patient population serve Children 's Mercy Hospital ( CMH ; representative 12 month period ) follow : White , 59.6 % ; African-American , 31.9 % ; Hispanic , 4.9 % ; Asian , 0.6 % ; Native American , 0.1 % ; Other , 2.9 % . The gender distribution 44.4 % female 55.6 % male . An equal number pediatric patient meet DSM-IV criterion primary diagnosis ADHD ADD ( ~33 % ) age- sex-matched control ( ~67 % ) recruit . The patient represent population child reasonably expect treat medication primarily dependent upon CYP2D6 elimination body . An example atomoxetine , also know Strattera® . Each patient ask invite friend participate phenotyping study , provide non-ADHD population reference . Additional phenotyping visit occur every six month ( total 7 visit ) . Justification : Assuming 10 % attrition rate second visit , sample size expect provide approximately 25 patient 25 control ( 50 subject total ) initial 2-year age bin : 7.0 9.0 , 9.1 11.0 , 11.1 13.0 , 13.1 15.0 . Subjects enrol via informed permission/assent study outpatient utilizing resource provide Pediatric Clinical Research Unit locate Division Clinical Pharmacology Medical Toxicology Children 's Mercy Hospital . For ADHD group , patient treat atomoxetine time study enrollment allow participate . Although vitro study indicate atomoxetine inhibits CYP2D6 activity ~50 % , appear effect vivo single dose pharmacokinetics CYP2D6 substrate , desipramine , unaffected four day atomoxetine 60 mg b.i.d . Thus , expect substantial effect DM biotransformation . Furthermore , six month interval phenotyping visit ADHD patient prescribed medication know CYP2D6 inhibitor , allow continue study ; dose start date medication record effect inhibitor CYP2D6 phenotype ( urinary metabolite ratio endogenous biomarker ) determine . These data point exclude ontogeny genotype-phenotype correlation analysis Pre-study visit . ( 1 hour long ) On screen visit , prospective subject ( parent ) provide description propose study . After question answer , give copy permission/assent form review sign Subjects medical history use medication review , include use non-prescription herbal remedy . All subject give complete physical examination physician , include vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature , height weight ) assessment pubertal development Tanner stage . Breast development assess visual inspection . Pubic hair assess visual inspection . Testicular volume measure direct comparison orchidometer bead . Tanner Staging assessed gender appropriate physician . Blood drawn needle stick serum chemistry , liver function test hematology panel ; portion also retain DNA test ( approximately 2 teaspoon blood total ) . Urine collect Urinalysis Micro . Numbing cream may apply site minimize discomfort . A urine pregnancy test perform female child bear age . The DNA testing , refer `` genotyping '' conduct combination technology design detect variation single nucleotide level ( include polymorphism , insertion deletion ) , large gene deletion , rearrangement , hybrid structure copy number variation use establish method Developmental Pharmacology Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory . As next-generation sequence technology becomes establish , exist technology replace next-generation sequencing ability ass entire gene region rather individual location . Study Day 1 ( 5 hour long ) Within approximately one week pre-study visit , subject admit study unit . The child must refrain eat 2 hour prior schedule visit . Prior dosing , subject completely empty bladder provide blank urine sample . Each subject give single 0.5 mg/kg dose DM Robitussin Cough ( 7.5 mg/5 ml ; alcohol-free , fruit punch flavor ) . All urine produce 4-hour study period collect . Urine retain analysis DM three metabolite , metabolomic analysis . One hour dosing , subject provide small meal select standard hospital menu . A pregnancy test perform female child bear age . Subjects ask provide breath ( inspiratory expiratory ) ten minute handheld indirect calorimeter ( ie . MedGen/Body Gem : also know `` GEM '' ) clip nose . The measurement obtain rest metabolic rate occur prior dose 4 hour post dose . Subjects ask feel study go home . Study Day 2-7 ( 5 hour long ) The remain visit occur every 6 month follow Study Day 1 ; study session delay 1-2 week subject suffer flu-like symptom . The child must refrain eat 2 hour prior schedule visit . For female , pregnancy test conduct use pre-dose urine sample prior DM dose . Subjects medical history use medication review , include use non-prescription herbal remedy . Subjects give complete physical examination physician , include vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature , height weight ) assessment pubertal development Tanner stage . Breast development assess visual inspection . Pubic hair assess visual inspection . Testicular volume measure direct comparison orchidometer bead . Tanner Staging assessed gender appropriate physician . Subjects admit study unit . Prior dosing , subject completely empty bladder provide blank urine sample . Each subject give single 0.5 mg/kg dose DM Robitussin Cough ( 7.5 mg/5 ml ; alcohol-free , fruit punch flavor ) . All urine produce 4-hour study period collect . Urine retain analysis DM three metabolite , metabolomic analysis . One hour dosing , subject provide small meal select standard hospital menu . A pregnancy test perform female child bear age . Subjects ask provide breath ( inspiratory expiratory ) ten minute handheld indirect calorimeter ( ie . MedGen/Body Gem : also know `` GEM '' clip nose . The measurement obtain rest metabolic rate occur prior dosing . Subjects ask feel study go home .</detailed_description>
