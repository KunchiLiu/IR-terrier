	<brief_title>Biomarkers Tissue Samples From Patients With High-Risk Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess genomic gain loss high risk renal tumor , include 80 favorable histology Wilms tumor relapse ( RFHWT ) , 50 anaplastic Wilms tumor ( UHWT ) , 15 clear cell sarcoma kidney ( CCSK ) , 40 rhabdoid tumor ( RT ) use high density genetic platform survey recurrent copy number variation allelic imbalance . II . To define transcription pattern within 80 RFHWT , 50 UHWT , 15 CCSK , 40 RT use high throughput platform global gene expression . III . To define DNA methylation pattern within 80 RFHWT , 50 UHWT , 15 CCSK , 40 RT use high throughput platform . IV . To identify genetic mutation involve pathogenesis Wilms tumor , development relapse anaplasia study 80 RFHWT , 50 UHWT , 15 CCSK , 40 RT use next generation sequencing tool . V. To facilitate integration database allow meaningful access investigator infrastructure provide TARGET , include data portal associate caBIG tool . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Archived tumor tissue sample analyze DNA copy number determination , gene expression , DNA methylation , genomic re-sequencing array-based method , include PCR analysis , methylation-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR ( RT-PCR ) , quantitative RT-PCR .</detailed_description>
