	<detailed_description>Justification research : The trisomy 21 frequent cause handicap genetic origin incidence 1.3/1 000 birth increase maternal age . Several strategy antenatal screen develop . The High Authority Health recently recommend propose pregnant woman 1st trimester combine screening , realize 11+0 13+6 week amenorrhoea , associate measure NUCALE translucency dosage maternal serum : PAPP-A ( Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A ) βhCG ( free β human Chorionic 1st trimester Gonadotrophin ) . However , sensibility screening test 80 % 5 % positive false . The diagnosis aneuploidy establish population classify high risk , foetal karyotype ( require invasive procedure : biopsy trophoblast amniocentesis ) . A positive screening increase maternal medical anxiety . Furthermore , inappropriate combination test origin numerous useless invasive procedure ( national rate amniocentesis 11 % ) , risk foetal loss ( 0,5 1 % ) . This inflation invasive procedure lead many loss affect child trisomic child badly know maternal morbidity . Several study show 10 % free DNA find first quarter pregnancy maternal plasma foetal origin DNA specific foetal nuclear DNA current pregnancy . This open way possible invasive antenatal diagnosis foetal aneuploidy collide last 10 year performances limit isolation sequence foetal DNA maternal plasma . A new technique analysis broadband sequence DNA circulate maternal blood diagnosis frequent aneuploid trisomy 21 bring back ( report ) . The High-output shotgun sequence DNA circulate maternal blood , read identification chromosome sequence allow analyze quantity DNA result supernumerary chromosome , without necessity differentiate maternal foetal DNA . On basis recent work 10 , excess sequence result specifically chromosome 21 foetal supernumerary allows discrimination complete trisomy 21 disomy 21 . However , study analyze 9 case trisomy 21 sample maternal blood realize amniocentesis choriocenteses , could artificially increase quantity circulate foetal DNA . Objectives : Demonstrate High output shotgun sequence foetal DNA maternal blood could allow complete discrimination mother trisomic fetus 21 DISOMIQUE fetus 21 first quarter pregnancy , obtain reliable alternative invasive procedure . Method Two public centre antenatal screen establish answer specifically recommendation High Authority Health capacity make 20 000 act screenings year . All woman present high risk ( &gt; 1/250 ) aneuploidy candidate invasive procedure , see suggest participate study . The included patient maternal blood sample invasive test . This take put hold in-80°C centrifugation follow recommend protocol . At end inclusion , technic analysis circulate DNA realize blind laboratory diagnose case ( usual invasive examination , conclusion pregnancy ) trisomy 21 control representative spectre level risk . A study reproducibility quantification DNA chromosome 21 realize . Number subject : plan include 75 case trisomy 21 150 control case normal karyotype , allow detect 99,9 % sensibility 99,99 % specificity power least 95 % . Duration study : objective practicable two year basis number invasive taking realize center already realize study Ethical Aspects : research data biological collection . No individual medical decision take accord estimated test . Perspectives : new technique , generalizable , would allow limit number procedure invasive diagnosis ( amniocentesis choriocentesis ) contain significant risk grave maternal fetal complication , optimize capacity screen .</detailed_description>
