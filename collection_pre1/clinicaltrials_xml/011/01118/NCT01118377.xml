	<brief_title>A Study Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) Concomitant Radiation Therapy Children With Newly Diagnosed Brainstem Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The open-label phase 2 study NO21125 ( NCT01118377 ) evaluate progression-free survival , safety , pharmacokinetics capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) rapidly disintegrate tablet concomitant radiation therapy child adolescent patient newly diagnose brainstem glioma . There 2 phase study : A 9-week radiation phase , follow 2-week rest period , 9-week post-radiation phase . In radiation phase , capecitabine 650 mg/m^2 administer orally twice daily 9 week . Concomitantly , patient receive radiation therapy ( 180 cGy fraction ) 5 day week total target dose 56 Gy . During 9-week post-radiation phase study , capecitabine 1250 mg/m^2 administer orally twice daily 14 day follow 7-day rest period . This cycle 14 day treatment follow 7 day rest repeat 2 additional time . The dose could adjust accord toxicity body surface area . The single-arm phase 1 study NO18517 ( NCT00532948 ) assess maximum tolerated dose dose-limiting toxicity capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) administer concurrently radiation therapy child newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic brain stem gliomas high grade glioma . Patients phase 1 study NO18517 diagnose intrinsic brainstem glioma treat establish maximum tolerate dose capecitabine 650 mg/m^2/dose twice day include analysis phase 2 study NO21125 . The efficacy safety result study NO21125 report .</detailed_description>
