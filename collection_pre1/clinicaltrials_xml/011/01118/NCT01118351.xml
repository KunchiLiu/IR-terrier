	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Recurrent Transitional Cell Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical efficacy oral sunitinib ( Sutent ) give continuously maximum 12 week , respect complete response rate 12 month completion treatment patient high-risk superficial bladder cancer fail previous intravesical BCG . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess impact sunitinib treatment recurrence-free survival , progression-free survival , overall survival patient high-risk superficial TCC bladder fail previous intravesical BCG . II . To evaluate safety tolerability sunitinib ( Sutent ) administer patient high-risk superficial TCC bladder fail previous intravesical BCG . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess pre-treatment tissue baseline angiogenic marker evaluate magnitude difference among variable post-treatment tumor tissue treatment sunitinib ( Sutent ) . II . To evaluate effect Sunitinib ( Sutent ) immunosuppressive regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) . III . To determine presence circulate tumor cell superficial BCG-refractory TCC patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
