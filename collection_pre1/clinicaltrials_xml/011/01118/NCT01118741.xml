	<detailed_description>The primary hypothesis study disulfiram DNA methyltransferase inhibitor may provide benefit patient prostate cancer restoration tumor suppressor gene . Disulfiram potent DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1 ) inhibitor vitro laboratory recently find one potent inhibitor PCa growth vitro screen Johns Hopkins Drug Library . Based data , extensive vitro vivo study perform explore potential antitumor activity prostate PCa . Using androgen sensitive insensitive PCa cell line , confirm disulfiram demethylate know highly methylated tumor suppressor gene APC RARß PCa cell line . Disulfiram inhibit PCa cell growth vitro vivo . In addition new finding , antitumor activity disulfiram possible mechanism action well documented literature . Disulfiram show induce apoptosis number cell line include PCa . A variety underlie mechanisms anticancer activity report . Disulfiram show reduce angiogenesis , inhibit DNA topoisomerases , inhibit nuclear factor κB , induce p21 p53 G1/S cell cycle arrest , induce pro-apoptotic redox-related mitochondrial membrane permeabilization , inactivate Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase Cu2+ complexation , inhibit Zn2+-dependent matrix metalloproteinases , prevent tumor invasion metastasis . The disulfiram analogue pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( PDTC ) show inhibit proteasomal activity combination copper human breast PCa cell line . Also , disulfiram metabolite permanently inactivate human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein reverse either MDR1- MRP1-mediated drug efflux .</detailed_description>
