	<brief_summary>Distal radius fracture ( DRF ) common type fracture human body , large proportion DRFs result complication . Previously propose preventive strategy questionable efficacy may impose additional risk patient . Because many complication secondary distal radius fracture associate excessive swelling , prophylactic mean edema reduction could dramatically reduce morbidity among population . A compression glove non-invasive , non-pharmacological way reduce edema . Previous study confirm utility edema reduction hand trauma among patient chronic inflammatory condition , none sufficiently investigate application patient distal radius fracture , population intervention could large impact . The investigator propose randomize controlled trial evaluate use compression glove recovery among patient sustain unstable distal radius fracture . The investigator hypothesize patient wear compression glove distal radius fracture : - Will experience less edema - Will demonstrate great functionality - Will recover quickly - Will low incidence rate carpal tunnel syndrome - Will low incidence rate complex regional pain syndrome</brief_summary>
