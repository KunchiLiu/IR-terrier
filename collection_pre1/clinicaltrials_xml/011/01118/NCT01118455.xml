	<brief_summary>This randomize study design compare long-term treatment outcome pediatric patient refractory seizure treat VNS ( Vagus Nerve Stimulation ) Therapy versus anti-epileptic drug ( AEDs ) . Seizure reduction , quality life measure , side effect profile evaluate . The result study provide control comparative data well guide physician determine best overall treatment strategy patient seizures failed initial AED therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Assess Vagus Nerve Stimulation Therapy vs. Anti-Epileptic Drug ( AED ) Treatment Children With Refractory Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , parallel group , multi-center study . Screening Visit ( visit 1 ) Subjects , parent , investigator sign date informed consent subject eligibility check . Eligible subject enter baseline period . Baseline Period ( visit 1 2 ) Eligible subject enter 8-week baseline period seizure count do . During period , subject caregiver contact regular basis ensure date information collection . At end baseline period , subject continue eligible stratify base previous therapy history ( Early : previously treat 2 5 AEDs versus Non-early : previously treat &gt; 5 AEDs ) . Within stratification , investigator randomize subject receive one 2 treatment ( VNS Therapy treatment AED treatment ) end visit 2 use randomization schedule provide independent third party ( Synergos ) . Implantation/AED Treatment Initiation ( visit 3 ) For subject randomize AED arm , new AED treatment initiate gradually increase effective dose accordance investigator 's discretion manufacturer 's suggest guideline . Subjects randomize VNS treatment arm implant VNS Therapy System allow adequate surgical recovery accord usual clinical practice initiation treatment . A delay 2 week end baseline period surgery authorize allow practical organization implantation . Extension period approve advance Study Director delegate . Treatment Ramp-up ( visit 3 4 ) This ramp-up period AEDs VNS may take 9 week , end visit 4 . Additional visit schedule outside study protocol adequately accommodate Treatment Ramp-up need . Initiation treatment well ramp-up schedule document Case Report Forms . Study Treatment Period The Study Treatment Period 12 month ( 52 week ) follow visit 3 include Treatment Ramp-up . Because study design compare natural course treatment , change study AED dose ( AED group ) VNS stimulation parameter ( VNS Therapy group ) allow clinically indicate Study Treatment Period . The protocol allow approximately 10 % increase baseline AED allow increase growth patient VNS arm . Study End At end study , subject AED group significant improvement study assessment complete offer VNS device implantation . Subjects VNS arm adequate improvement evaluate AED treatment . Number Subjects : Approximately 400 subject randomize 1:1 ratio either AED VNS treatment stratum . Strata accord AED treatment history ( Early subject previously treat fail treatment 2 5 AEDs , Non-early subject treat fail treatment &gt; 5 AEDs ) . At least 15 study site enroll subject . Initially , United Kingdom ( UK ) sit select . During course trial , extension use add non-UK center . A total 151 subject underwent screen prior enrollment . Eight fail screening , 143 go randomize . Of randomized , 8 subject ( 4 treatment group ) treat . One patient VNS arm explanted prior initiation device stimulation , exclude . Therefore , 134 subject treat ( ITT population ) : 65 implant VNS system 69 treated AED . Nineteen investigational site UK , Austria , Belgium , Germany , Sweden participate study enrol subject . Study Duration : The maximum study follow-up approximately 14 month enrollment study exit . The study terminate due insufficient enrollment prior reach 400 subject specify protocol . After 4.5 year enrollment , Sponsor terminate enrollment follow remain subject 52 week follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
