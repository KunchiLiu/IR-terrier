	<brief_summary>Orotracheal intubation follow general anesthesia require blade perform . The risk patient contamination infectious agent relate reusable metal blade lead promote single-use blade . Some latter plastic material may need strength lift jaw expose larynx orotracheal intubation . Sometimes , change blade , plastic metal , procedure necessary increase larynx exposure . This change blade may increase frequency sore throat follow orotracheal intubation . Consequently , study hypothesis increase sore throat intensity frequency plastic blade compare metal blade . The primary purpose present study compare impact two type blade , metal versus plastic , sore throat intensity frequency follow schedule orotracheal intubation general anesthesia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Blades Used Scheduled Orotracheal Intubation Postoperative Sore Throat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial design : This multicenter , prospective , randomized single-blind control study Material Methods : The obtain Ethic Committee approval allow enrolment 712 patient schedule surgery perform general anesthesia orotracheal intubation . Adult patient , 18 70 years-old , grade I-II ASA ( American Society Anesthesiology ) status enrol clear information obtain , anesthesia visit , non-opposition enrol trial . At anesthesia visit , anesthesiologist explain purpose protocol patient propose participate study . The decision enrol know pre-anesthesia visit , one day surgery . Therefore , patient delay anesthesia pre-anesthesia visit make decision . The non-opposition participate trial clearly mention medical file . A randomization list establish statistician . Informed non-opposed patient allocate randomization number plastic metal blade operating theatre via Clean Web software . The evaluation measure primary outcome make single-blind way . The patient evaluate sore throat intensity unaware type blade use orotracheal intubation . An independent research assistant centre collect data evaluate operating room orotracheal intubation procedure post-operative period . The duration tracheal intubation define time elapse mouth insertion blade passage tube throughout vocal cord announce operator . The intra-tracheal position tube confirm three square cycle capnography . Protocol : Anesthesia monitoring : Patients premedicated hydroxyzine 1 mg kg-1 previous even one hour transfer operating room . The randomization perform operating room anesthesia induction . The monitoring standard : - An electrocardiogram ( lookout cardiac rhythm modification ) - A pulse oxymetry lookout arterial oxygen saturation - A non-invasive blood pressure monitor - A capnograph lookout carbon dioxide elimination expire gas confirm intra-tracheal position tube - A gas analyser control concentration administer halogenated volatile agent - A neuromuscular blockade monitor lookout depth neuromuscular blockade require perform tracheal intubation optimal condition . The monitoring consist stimulate facial nerve 1 cm near external eyelid corner train four electric charge ( 30 mA ) . The muscular response evaluate corrugator Supercilia count number contraction . - A bispectral index ( BIS ) entropy monitor hypnosis depth . The expected value 40-60 25-35 , respectively . - A manometer control tracheal tube cuff pressure Before anesthesia induction , patient breathe 100 % oxygen till expire oxygen concentration reach 90 % . Intravenous anesthesia perform propofol ( 1.5-2.5 mg kg -1 ) hypnotic , sufentanil ( 0.2 mcg kg-1 ) atracurium ( 0.5 mg kg-1 ) muscle relaxant . Cis-atracurium vecuronium middle act muscle relaxant SUNCCYNILCHOLINE short act muscle relaxant authorize . According randomization , blade use orotracheal intubation metal plastic . The metal blade reusable plastic blade disposable . When BIS entropy reach 40-60 25-35 , respectively , efficient face mask ventilation ( good thoracic amplitude follow capnography cycle ) , response TOF corrugator Supercilia , laryngoscopy perform accord orotracheal intubation algorithm . Tracheal tube size 7 mm female 7.5 male . Tracheal tube cuff standard . After tracheal intubation , anesthesia maintain inhaled halogenated gas intravenously . Inhaled gas moisten . Postoperative analgesia anticipate operating room paracetamol 1 g , ketoprofen 100 mg nefopam necessary . In absence contraindication , three analgesic administered laparotomy . Wound abdominal hole laparoscopy infiltrated ropivacaine . At end surgery , tracheal tube withdrawn accord standard procedure recommend French Anesthesiology Society . Mouth secretion suction delicately . In PACU , analgesia continue accord protocol adapt type surgery . Morphine administer pain VAS reach 4/10 . Pharyngeal laryngeal morbidity evaluation begin discharge PACU last 48 hour . If sign persist 48 hour , ENT examination perform make diagnostic . Statistics : Sample size : The literature report 30 % incidence postoperative sore throat metal blade . The hypothesis incidence could increase 30 % 40 % plastic blade use . Un sample size 356 patient per group require detect increase 10 % Chi2 test , statistic power ( 1-beta ) 0.80 alpha type I error probability 0.05 .</detailed_description>
