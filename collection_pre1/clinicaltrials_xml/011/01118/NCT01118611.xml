	<brief_title>Aurora B/C Kinase Inhibitor GSK1070916A Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine establish safety profile Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A define dose-limiting toxicity patient advance solid tumor . - To determine maximum-tolerated dose Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A patient . Secondary - To determine plasma pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter follow administration Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A patient . - To evaluate tumor response least 1 cycle treatment Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A patient . - To propose safe dose Phase II evaluation . Tertiary - To investigate effect Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A marker mitosis/cell proliferation apoptosis human . - To investigate metabolism Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A human . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A IV 1 hour daily day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive escalate dos Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) determine . Once MTD define , 15-18 additional patient recruit expanded MTD cohort patient receive Aurora B/C kinase inhibitor GSK1070916A MTD . Patients expand MTD cohort must consent either tumor biopsy take FDG-PET/CT DW-MRI scan perform . Patients may undergo tissue , blood , urine sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , correlative laboratory study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 28 day .

	<criteria>Eligibility criteria The patient must fulfil eligibility criterion ( list Section 4.1.1 4.1.2 ) . Additional eligibility criterion must fulfil expand MTD cohort ( list Section 4.1.3 ) . 4.1.1 Inclusion criterion : 1 . Histologically cytologically proven solid tumour refractory conventional treatment , conventional therapy exist 2 . Life expectancy least 3 month 3 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 0 1 4 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week ( Day 7 Day 1 ) patient go study . Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 10.0 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) AND aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless raise due tumour case 5 x ULN permissible Calculated creatinine clearance ( preferably measure EDTA/ DTPA ( isotope method ) otherwise calculate use Wright formula ) ≥ 50 mL/min ( uncorrected value ) 5 . 18 year 6 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup 4.1.2 Exclusion criterion : 1 . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy chemotherapy previous four week ( six week nitrosoureas , MitomycinC six week investigational medicinal product ) treatment . 2 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator Drug Development Office ( DDO ) exclude patient . 3 . Known brain metastasis . 4 . Patients therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin exclude . ( 1mg warfarin line maintenance acceptable ; conversion low molecular weight heparin acceptable must do minimum seven day prior first dose study drug ) . 5 . Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom , intrauterine device condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) four week enter trial , trial six month afterwards consider eligible . 6 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] trial six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( e.g . condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 7 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 8 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 9 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 10 . QTc interval ≥ 450 msec men ≥ 470 msecs woman clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality ( QTc preferably calculate use algorithm Appendix 6 ) . 11 . Use medicine know prolong QTc within 14 day prior first dose study drug ( see Category 1 Appendix 5 ) . 12 . Previous exposure aurora kinase inhibitor 13 . Concurrent congestive heart failure , prior history class III/ IV cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] refer Appendix 4 ) 14 . History cardiac ischaemia , cardiac arrhythmia , coronary angioplasty stenting previous 12 month . Patients currently medication cardiac arrhythmia also exclude . 15 . Patients know leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % . A multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram must perform clinically indicate . 16 . Any condition Investigator‟s opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial . 17 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical study , whilst take part Phase I study GSK1070916A . Participation observational study would acceptable . 4.1.3 Additional inclusion / exclusion criterion expand MTD cohort : Once tolerability confirm initial three six patient MTD , patient expand cohort must either consent tumour biopsy take FDG PETCT DW/DCEMRI scan perform . The minimum number patient required part expansion cohort six . The following additional inclusion / exclusion criterion apply . For patient consent tumour biopsy : 1 . Additional write ( sign date ) inform consent tumour biopsy must give . 2 . The patient‟s tumour amenable biopsy . For patient consent FDG PETCT DW/DCEMRI scan : 3 . Additional write ( sign date ) inform consent FDG PETCT DW/DCEMRI scan must give . 4 . Patients diabetes must condition good control ( blood sugar le 10mmol/L ) . 5 . Patients must able tolerate / comply image protocol ( i.e . patient high level pain , urinary incontinence , claustrophobia etc exclude ) . 6 . Patients tumours know poorly FDG avid ( e.g . mucinous adenocarcinoma , well differentiate neuroendocrine hepatocellular carcinoma ) falsely negative ( e.g . tumour less 56mm ) exclude . Refer Appendix 7 full list exclude tumour . 7 . Patients implant metallic device ( e.g . pacemaker ) exclude .</criteria>
