Hypothesis 2 : A significant difference psychiatric outcome ( psychiatric hospitalization , suicidal ideation , suicide attempt completion , mental health-related contact ) identify history TBI versus without history TBI determine , first , TBI-4 , second , OSU TBI-ID . Hypothesis 3 : The prevalence Traumatic Brain Injury- Loss Consciousness ( TBI-LOC ) population similar identify Walker et al1 ( 31.7 % individual report 1 TBI-LOC ) .</brief_summary>
