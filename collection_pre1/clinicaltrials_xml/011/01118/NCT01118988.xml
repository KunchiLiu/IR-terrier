	<brief_title>Peer Mentorship : An Intervention To Promote Effective Pain Self-Management In Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic intractable non-malignant pain , include functional disorder irritable bowel syndrome recognize significant problem child adolescent , potential long-term impact child 's physical , social , academic functioning , well family whole . A recent study 5000 Dutch school child 18 find 25 % report suffering recurrent continuous pain 3 month , prevalence increase age ; survey 735 German child age 10-18 use modify version instrument find 45.5 % . The common type pain two study headache , abdominal pain , limb pain , back pain . This data would appear confirm earlier estimate recurrent headache , include migraine , occur 11 % 26 % child age 7-15 ; recurrent abdominal pain 10-15 % recurrent limb pain 4-18 % child age 7-15 . Many child apparently continue function effectively , attend school continue normal activity , medical intervention acute episode . A small , significant , number , however , find unable self-manage pain . They become patient chronic pain disability , fall cyclical pattern pain , impair functioning physical , school , social , even family self-care domain , `` doctor-seeking '' over-utilization medication , psychosocial distress , include anxiety depression . Functional impairment , particularly academic work social participation , likely long-term effect individual 's quality life , even aside possibility pain physical limitation may persist adulthood . Several well-designed study use quantitative measure provide evidence impaired functioning child chronic pain strongly associate psychosocial distress low quality life . In particular , child unexplained chronic pain , pain associate organic diagnosis , often report significant dysfunction normal activity , schoolwork , sleep , family activity , athletic activity . But , although impaired function major factor low quality life child chronic pain , still know relatively little prevalence severity functional impairment , child experience limitation others , treatment intervention effective improve function . The available evidence also indicate child show different level adjustment chronic pain time . Chronic idiopathic musculoskeletal pain show persist 59 % case long nine year ; study , author find child pain disability level comparable child juvenile chronic arthritis , low level psychosocial functioning . Hunfeld , Perquin , colleague Rotterdam trace persistence chronic benign pain 30-45 % case two year three year , increase intensity frequency . In latter study , open-ended interview elicit information function cop skill , identify continue problem physical activity , mental concentration , social interaction , psychological stress ( become `` moody '' ) , particularly pain severe . The researcher find , however , several child develop strategy maximize functionality despite continue pain : `` â€¦pain become part daily live several adolescent , structured activity sleep hour prevent aggravation pain '' . A recent cluster analysis 117 child chronic pain divide three group basis set psychosocial behavioral measure : highly distress disable ; show low level distress disability ; show moderate level distress disability , whose family environment score low cohesion . Although several factor may account child 's differential ability function adjust persistent chronic pain , child 's sense self-competence identify key variable recent literature . Claar colleague , example , find adolescent young adult irritable bowel syndrome , relationship pain functional disability moderate individual 's sense academic , social , athletic competence . The concept self-competence ( general sense mastery ) overlap self-efficacy ( task-specific sense mastery ) , develop Albert Bandura late 1970s early 1980s 18 . The concept self-efficacy suggest explanation relationship cop skill , perceive ability cope , reduction physical psychological disability . Bandura argue sense self-efficacy enables individual persist even task great difficulty master , reject negative thought `` bring cognitive cerebral production '' assist achieve goal . To summarize briefly , impair functioning domain major potentially long-term problem child recurrent chronic pain family , significant segment American population . Children show significant variation ability cope pain continue function , child learn good functioning time . The child 's sense self-competence , task-specific self-efficacy , one important factor may reinforce moderate child 's functioning . Functional disability clearly associate psychosocial distress . But factor also mutually reinforce ; child psychosocial distress may problem function pain , certainly child experience pain attendant functional problem likely react anxiety and/or depression . Current Therapeutic Interventions : When chronic pain fully alleviate , optimal goal patient learn effective way continue function self-manage pain ; several therapeutic program develop , base theory health behavior change , assist patient process . The early , operant learn model develop Wilbert Fordyce colleague late 1970s , demonstrate individual could induce alter behavior - specifically , engage active exercise limit dependence medication - response social form positive reinforcement . Fordyce 's program prove helpful many patient , criticize determinist emphasis observable behavior disregard fact patient `` active information processor '' , behavior merely response learn cue shape cognitive process , expectation increase pain anxiety physiological harm . The revise therapeutic program develop response criticism draw overlap model link health belief health behavior self-efficacy describe Bandura . These new model rely expectancy-value theory behavior ; behavioral change simple learn response reinforcement , learn influence individual 's cognitive belief ( expectancy ) s/he able change function positive consequence ( self-efficacy ) his/her expectation ( value ) potential benefit barrier behavioral change . Thus new therapeutic program , well-known widely practice cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , seek mediate behavioral change cognitive relearning . The cognitive behavioral therapist use number method -- include education pain , verbal reinforcement positive cognition action , biofeedback , group therapy allow patient observe learn , teach cognitive tool repress negative thought -- help patient develop positive expectation behavior change , minimize negative expectation , internalize conviction his/her ability overcome barrier effectively self-manage pain In effect , patient becomes agent change . CBT show effective controlled trial treatment pain cancer patient ; chronic low-back pain ; osteoarthritic knee pain ; sickle cell disease ; pediatric migraine ; recurrent abdominal pain child . CBT family involvement find effective intervention adolescent chronic pain chronic fatigue 31-33 . Flor , Fydrich , Turk 's 1992 analysis 65 study multidisciplinary treatment chronic low back pain adult , cover number variant cognitive , behavioral , cop skill train package , note many study `` marginal '' quality , nevertheless demonstrate method superior treatment single-modality treatment -- medical physical therapy -- decrease pain impairment , improve mood , promote return work , decrease health service utilization . `` Even follow , patient ... function well 75 % '' control group ; finding efficacy `` quite impressive '' . A recent systematic review behavioral treatment low back pain find six study `` high quality '' . The author nevertheless think evidence strong behavioral therapy least `` moderate positive effect '' pain intensity `` small positive effect '' functional status ; note `` still unknown type patient benefit '' behavioral therapy . A well-designed intervention , appear , enough : patient benefit CBT . As Dennis Turk , lead exponent CBT , state , patient motivation least one critical factor successful outcomes therapeutic model . Jensen colleague recently propose cogent general model integrates vary theoretical approach describe dynamic process pivot concept motivation , readiness change . An individual 's readiness change , argue , essential his/her ability learn successful pain self-management new behavior ; readiness dynamic function 1 ) his/her perceive importance change ( beliefs cost benefit change , past experience change ( learn history ) , current contingency ( availability social material support ) 2 ) his/her self-efficacy belief ( personal experience , model provide others , verbal persuasion , perceive barrier ) . They suggest clinical approach enhance readiness promote change , include encouragement practice self-management ; allow patient observe pain patient practice self-management ; support positive belief non-judgmental non-support negative belief ; development plan address real perceived barrier ; call research intervention along line enhance motivation . Another formulation recently propose Sharp stress patient 's cognitive activity appraise evaluate pain , ongoing interactive effect mood , behavior , somatic focus . The patient 's initial response pain function cultural belief , learn history , current contingency , argues , continually reinterpret ongoing event . In particular , anxiety recurrent pain avoidance activity might cause pain help perpetuate patient 's hypervigilance sign recur pain ( describe Eccleston Crombez ) his/her perceived inability manage pain . Moreover , Sharp contend attitude `` learned helplessness '' may perpetuate physician fail offer helpful treatment even confirm physical reality patient 's suffering . `` That , patient could start believe 'nothing work far would future treatment help ? '' A patient reach point likely negative assessment benefit pain self-management his/her ability self-efficacy learn skill , therefore show lack readiness change . In study , consider adolescent pain patient whether new type innovation promote readiness change learn pain self-management skill , promote positive outcome pain reduction improve functioning . Findings Current Research : Our interdisciplinary group , comprise researcher anthropology , history , pediatrics , psychology , sociology , collect quantitative interview data 74 adolescent child present 2003 2006 Pediatric Pain , Pediatric Gastroenterology , Pediatric Neurology Clinics recurrent persistent pain . We complete preliminary analysis qualitative data subset 37 ( 28 girl 9 boy , average age 13.97 ) intake six-month follow-up data obtain . These child report suffer pain period range one month `` life '' : average compute duration 53.6 month , 4.5 year . All see least one physician prior referral UCLA majority see three . The child 's level function vary considerably quantitative measure , evidence long , semi-structured interview ( conduct prior first Clinic appointment 6 month ) show virtually distressed level impairment . Those pain several year report pain become part daily life adjust life around : Many child also state unexplained chronic pain , series doctor able diagnose , give sense isolation difference others , sense powerlessness , contribute distress : Those child see Pediatric Pain Clinic ( 28 , 76 % 37 ) give recommendation choose one list complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) provider work clinic ; include several teach pain self-management skill , include physical therapist , yoga therapist , biofeedback trainer , guide imagery/hypnotherapist . These recommendation make addition test , change medication therapy . Children see GI Neuro Clinic might give recommendation PT another CAM treatment , standardized part treatment plan . At follow-up interview , child ask whether pain functioning improve , also talk participation CAM therapy : Better , pain improve resolved medication change - 8 ; 22 % Better , participation active CAM help - 8 ; 22 % Better , medication change participation active CAM therapy - 4 ; 11 % Same , med help , interest CAM - 6 ; 16 % Same , med help , CAM try recommended reimbursement issue - 5 ; 13 % Same , med help , child tried CAM persist - 2 ; 6 % Worse , med help , interest CAM - 1 ; 3 % Worse , med help , CAM expensive - 1 ; 3 % Worse , med help , child tried CAM persist - 1 ; 3 % Worse reason ( intervene surgery increase pain ) - 1 ; 3 % These finding present supportive evidence benefit CAM therapy . Rather , indicate , , group child , aside small group help medication change one outlier case , self-motivated participate therapy teach active self-management consistently report good outcome self-motivated unable . Why 16 child choose participate persist participate recommend CAM therapy ? One possible explanation lack confidence new therapy work many others fail work believe pain different intractable problem doctor know treat could manage . Another give opportunity observe others ; give sufficient reinforcement family significant contact participation ; help overcome perceived barrier access . On basis preliminary data , consider light current theoretical model , propose follow hypothesis : - Adolescents participate actively learn pain-management skill show improvement pain function 2 4 month . - Adolescents lack peer support learn pain management skill follow learning skill without reinforcement , even recommend part treatment plan . - Adolescents may help adhere treatment involve learn pain management skill improve pain function talk others learn skill ; receive ongoing positive reinforcement ; help overcome perceived barrier . We propose test hypothesis trial peer mentorship intervention , use trained adolescent successfully learn pain management skill mentor . The mentor help relieve child 's sense isolation difference relate similar experience , provide model successful skill learn reinforce mentor subject 's participation skill learn activity .</detailed_description>
