	<brief_summary>Background : - Adoptive cell therapy involve take white blood cell call lymphocytes patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient allow cell attack tumor . Because process lengthy difficult perform , researcher develop improved mean perform adoptive cell therapy . Researchers interested compare adoptive cell therapy standard treatment metastatic melanoma ( skin cancer ) . Objectives : - To compare effectiveness adoptive cell therapy standard high-dose aldesleukin treatment metastatic melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old diagnose metastatic melanoma previously receive aldesleukin therapy cell therapy disease . - Participants must least one tumor easily remove part treatment procedure . Design : - Participants screen full medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , image scan evaluate tumor size treatment option . - Participants separate two group , one group adoptive cell therapy one aldesleukin treatment . - Adoptive Cell Therapy - Participants tumor sample take order collect white blood cell treatment . Participants whose tumor provide sufficient white blood cell may switch aldesleukin-only treatment group . - The white blood cell grown laboratory several week . - Prior receiving cell therapy , participant receive chemotherapy 7 day improve chance successful treatment . - Participants cell therapy follow high-dose aldesleukin treatment every 8 hour 5 day . This treatment follow 1 2 week recovery time inpatient clinical center . - Participants evaluate 12 week follow start study , every 2 3 month first year , every 6 month next 5years , yearly thereafter.. - Standard Aldesleukin Treatment - Participants high-dose aldesleukin treatment every 8 hour 5 day ( one cycle treatment ) , second cycle treatment 7 10 day first cycle . - If test show tumor grow , participant offer chance additional cycle aldesleukin , begin cell therapy treatment . - Participants evaluate 12 week follow start study , every 2 3 month first year , every 6 month next 5years , yearly thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Comparative Study Cell Transfer Therapy Using CD8+-Enriched Short-Term Cultured Anti-Tumor Autologous Lymphocytes Following Non-Myeloablative Lymphocyte Depleting Chemotherapy Regimen Compared High-Dose Aldesleukin M ...</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer autologous patient along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - Although adoptive cell therapy ( ACT ) show capable mediate objective clinical response patient metastatic melanoma , include patient previously treat aldesleukin chemotherapy , treatment available Surgery Branch , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) one two institution United States . - Despite report objective regression patient receive adoptive cell therapy ( ACT ) , doubt raise concern possible influence patient selection bias may account increase survival use ACT compare historical control . - ACT cumbersome labor intensive procedure discourage many apply . We recently develop simplification technique generate TIL also capable mediate objective response . - To evaluate efficacy ACT propose prospective randomize trial compare form therapy standard available treatment patient metastatic melanoma . Objectives : - To determine , prospective randomize trial , response rate progression free survival patient metastatic melanoma receive either ACT standard high-dose aldesleukin treatment . - Survival rate evaluate secondary endpoint . - To determine toxicity two treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old must : - Evaluable metastatic melanoma ; - No prior treatment high-dose aldesleukin ( great equal 600,000 IU IL-2 q8h equivalent ) - No contraindication high-dose aldesleukin administration ; - No concurrent major medical illness form immunodeficiency ; - Lesions least 2cm diameter surgically remove minimal morbidity . Design : - Prior amendment D , patient metastatic melanoma lesion resect minimal morbidity prospectively randomize receive either ACT use CD8+ young TIL ( arm 2 ) aldesleukin ( arm 1 ) follow non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen , receive standard high-dose aldesleukin therapy . - With approval amendment D , arm 1 2 close , two new arm open . Patients metastatic melanoma lesion resect minimal morbidity prospectively randomize receive either ACT use young TIL ( arm 4 ) aldesleukin ( arm 3 ) follow non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen , receive standard high-dose aldesleukin therapy . - Response rate time progression evaluate patient intent-to-treat basis . - Patients may crossover treatment arm progressive disease document Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , still eligible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Measurable metastatic melanoma least one lesion resectable tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) generation . The lesion must least 2cm diameter surgically remove minimal morbidity ( defined operation expect hospitalization less equal 7 day ) . 2 . Patients 3 less brain metastasis eligible . Note : If lesion symptomatic great equal 1 cm , lesion must treat stable 3 month patient eligible . 3 . No prior highdose aldesleukin therapy dose great equal 600,000 IU/kg . 4 . Greater equal 18 year age . 5 . Willing practice birth control treatment four month receive protocol relate therapy . 6 . Life expectancy great three month . 7 . Willing sign durable power attorney . 8 . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document . 9 . Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 1 . 10 . Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm^3 without support filgrastim Normal White blood cell ( WBC ) ( &gt; 3000/mm^3 ) . Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl Platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 k. Serology : Seronegative human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , hepatitis C antibody antigen . l. Chemistry : Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less three time upper limit normal . Calculated creatinine clearance estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &gt; 50 ml/min . Total bilirubin less equal 2 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3 mg/dl . m. More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time time randomization , patient ' toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except alopecia vitiligo ) . Patients must stable progress disease prior treatment . Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . n. Six week must elapse since prior antiCTLA4 antibody therapy allow antibody level decline . . Patients previously receive cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 ( antiCTLA4 ) antibody document gastrointestinal ( GI ) toxicity must normal colonoscopy normal colonic biopsy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Prior cell transfer therapy include nonmyeloablative myeloablative chemotherapy regimen . 2 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect preparative chemotherapy fetus infant . 3 . Systemic steroid therapy requirement . 4 .
