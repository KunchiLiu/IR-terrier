	<brief_title>GCC 0845 : Vorinostat Lapatinib Advanced Solid Tumors Advanced Breast Cancer Evaluate Response Biomarkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lapatinib anti-cancer drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer . HER2 protein involved growth cancer cell . In lab test small clinical study , lapatinib also find kill type cancer another relate protein call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . For participant cancer , use lapatinib study investigational . This mean drug FDA approve use . Vorinostat FDA approve treatment cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( type cancer ) . Vorinostat currently FDA approve breast cancer type cancer . The use vorinostat study investigational . Cancer cell travel blood stream spread organ . This process call metastasis . Lab test small clinical trial show vorinostat kill cancer cell prevent cancer cell travel blood stream . These trial show vorinostat improves well lapatinib kill cancer cell . Newer study also show subset cell , call `` cancer stem cell , '' come back , spread , become resistant usual chemotherapy . In laboratory test , find vorinostat lapatinib reduce number cancer stem cell . We look combine vorinostat lapatinib hope reduce number cancer stem cell cancer cell travel blood stream . There two part study . First part- We want learn best dose vorinostat give lapatinib . We want learn much vorinostat lapatinib go blood treatment . We also want learn side effect ( safety ) combination vorinostat lapatinib . All patient receive FDA-approved dose lapatinib . The first group patient get slightly low dose vorinostat give normally . If side effect serious , next group patient get dose vorinostat give normally . Second part- We find well combination vorinostat lapatinib work patient HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age great equal 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status less equal 2 . Consent peripheral blood sample analysis circulate tumor cell . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define protocol . Female patient histologically confirm adenocarcinoma breast recurrent localregional disease , metastatic disease progress treatment regimen include anthracycline , taxane , trastuzumab . Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) positive primary secondary tumor tissue define : Grade 3plus stain intensity ( scale 0 3 ) mean Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis OR Gene amplification fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) great equal 2.2 . Patients must measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion time enrollment . Prior trastuzumab therapy allow . Trastuzumab stop least 4 week prior enrollment . Patients receive investigational agent . Prior exposure lapatinib , vorinostat , Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor . Prior valproic acid exposure allow provide great equal 30 day washout period . History allergic reaction hypersensitivity compound similar chemical biologic composition vorinostat lapatinib . Patients history clinically significant uncontrolled cardiac disease , define protocol , significant cardiac condition judgment investigator unsuitable . Significant chronic recent ( less 30 day ) acute gastrointestinal disorder diarrhea major symptom ( e.g . Crohn 's disease , malabsorption , Grade 2 great diarrhea etiology baseline ) . Prior exposure 360 mg/m2 doxorubicin liposomal doxorubicin , 120 mg/m2 mitoxantrone , 90 mg/m2 idarubicin , elevate baseline cardiac troponin T ( upper limit normal ) . Patients active Central Nervous System ( CNS ) metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis exclude . Patients CNS metastasis complete course therapy would eligible study provide clinically stable 3 week prior entry define : ( 1 ) evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis ( 2 ) steroid and/or anticonvulsant , least 4 week enrollment . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding expect conceive study . Women able child must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment . All patient must use two effective method contraception ( include barrier method ) treatment 12 week stop treatment . The patient know Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis Cpositive ( test result require order participate ) . Patients current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Previous current systemic malignancy within past 3 year follow : Female breast cancer adequately treat carcinoma insitu cervix , Female Male basal/squamous carcinoma skin .</criteria>
