	<brief_title>A Study Explore Plasma Levels CONCERTA , Ritalin-SR Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study measure blood plasma concentration methylphenidate healthy volunteer 24 hour take three different long act methylphenidate product . This single-centre , randomize ( subject assign treatment sequence base chance ) , open-label ( people involve know identity intervention ) , single-dose , three-way crossover study ( participant may receive different intervention sequentially trial ) 30 healthy adult volunteer . Study drug take mouth 240mL room temperature noncarbonated water . Blood sample do via indwell catheter pre dose 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 20 24 hour post dose . An indwell venous catheter put place 24 hour period minimize discomfort frequent blood sampling . Each patient receive one dose treatment study specific sequence specify timepoints . The treatment : one 54mg Concerta tablet , one 54 mg Novo-methylphenidate ER-C tablet , 3x20mg Ritalin-SR tablet . The methylphenidate plasma concentration observe 24 hour post-dose time period compare volunteer across volunteer . Adverse event monitor time informed consent sign patient completes last study-related procedure . The investigator must follow adverse event report investigator satisfactory resolution reach clinically stable endpoint . Vital sign take study entry dose - well specific timepoints 24 hour sample period . Clinical lab EKG do screen 24 hour timepoint . The official study title follow : A Randomized , Open-label , Single-dose , Three-way Crossover Study Determine Relative Pharmacokinetic Profile Oral Doses CONCERTA Tablets , Ritalin-SR Tablets Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C Tablets Under Fasted Condition Healthy Subjects . Methylphenidate indicate treatment attention deficient hyperactivity disorder adult , adolescent child . Each volunteer receive one 54-mg CONCERTA tablet ( ) , one 54-mg Novo-Methylphenidate ER-C tablet ( ) three 20mg Ritalin-SR tablet ( ) specify time point study . Tablets administer single oral dose fast ( minimum 10 hour fast ) condition . Study drug administer orally 240 mL room temperature noncarbonated water .</detailed_description>
