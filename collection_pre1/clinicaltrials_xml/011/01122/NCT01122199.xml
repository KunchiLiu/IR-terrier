	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety combination two drug call RAD001 AMG479 . This study see effect ( good bad ) RAD001 AMG479 cancer . This study also find high dos RAD001 AMG479 give without cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study RAD001 + AMG479 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate ( MTD ) recommend Phase II dose AMG479 ( ganitumab ) RAD001 ( everolimus ) patient refractory solid tumor . II . To determine safety toxicity AMG479 RAD001 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine preliminary antitumor efficacy AMG479 RAD001 solid tumor : response stable disease rate , duration response stable disease , time progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . For patient , analyze tumor blood sample pharmacodynamic biomarkers relate IGF-1R mTOR signaling : pAkt , pS6 , p-4EBP1 , PTEN , IGF-1 , IGF-2 , pIGF-1R IGFBP3 correlate response stable disease . III . For patient , analyze pharmacokinetic profile ( PK ) RAD001 AMG479 , correlate response/stable disease pharmacodynamic marker . IV . To evaluate effect RAD001 AMG 479 pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive everolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ( day 1-7 16-28 course 1 ) ganitumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 15 ( day 15 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 30 , every 3 month 2 year registration study treatment , every 6 month year 3-5 , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
