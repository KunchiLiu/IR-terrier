	<detailed_description>The overall goal proposal determine autonomic nitric oxide contribution pathogenesis hypertension insulin resistance obese African American woman . Each year cardiovascular disease cause death approximately 54,000 African American woman United States.Obesity , hypertension insulin resistance prevalent among African American woman compare men Caucasians . These condition put increase risk development diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease . Obesity associate increase sympathetic nervous system activity . A positive linear association consistently report body fat muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA ) , direct measurement baroreflex modulate vasoconstrictive sympathetic outflow . We others report Caucasians increase sympathetic activation contribute obesity-associated hypertension . Our preliminary data African American woman indicate body mass index ( BMI ) , African American woman low autonomic contribution blood pressure Caucasians . We also find important difference body composition African American woman less fat mass . When total fat mass analyze base different component , visceral fat show metabolic active tissue subcutaneous fat mass , correlate sympathetic activity well index obesity . Therefore , specific aim 1a , propose test hypothesis visceral fat mass modulates contribution autonomic nervous system blood pressure obese African American woman . If autonomic nervous system contribute obesity-associated hypertension African American woman , cause racial difference ? . Other pathway involve blood pressure regulation , nitric oxide , might alter group . Several study report , compare Caucasians , African Americans decrease nitric oxide function isolate vascular bed . The significance finding blood pressure regulation unknown . We implement laboratory , new approach isolate contribution nitric oxide ( NO ) blood pressure , block autonomic ganglia neurotransmission trimethaphan production NO nitric oxide synthase inhibitor . This paradigm allow u define nitric oxide function absence baroreflex buffer interaction autonomic nervous system . In specific aim 1b , propose test hypothesis obese African American woman impair NO contribution blood pressure part pathogenesis hypertension group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Race selfdefined , subject report parent race include . All subject premenopausal . Age 3050 year old . We recruit subject wide range BMI 3045 kg/m2 . Both hypertensives nonhypertensives recruit Hypertension define seat blood pressure &gt; 130/85 determine least two occasion , therefore , include patient `` prehypertension '' . Subjects require negative serum/urine pregnancy test . In addition , ask use reliable contraceptive method prior enrollment determine PI ( Dr. Cyndya Shibao ) Previous allergic reaction study medication ( trimethaphan , LNMMA , phenylephrine ) inability take study medication prescribe course study . Use pacemaker metal implant NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MRI ( artificial heart valve , implant drug infusion port , artificial limb , implant nerve stimulator , metal pin , screw , plate , surgical staple ) . Type 1 2 diabetes mellitus define fast glucose 126 mg/dl great use antidiabetic medication . Cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , presence angina pectoris , significant arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ( LV hypertrophy acceptable ) , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , second third degree heart block , mitral valve stenosis , aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . History smoke current smoker . Significant weight change &gt; 5 % baseline past three month . Pregnancy breastfeed . History serious neurological disease cerebral hemorrhage stroke , transient ischemic attack . History presence immunological hematological disorder . Clinical significant gastrointestinal impairment could interfere drug absorption . Impaired hepatic function ( aspartate amino transaminase [ AST ] and/or alanine amino transaminase [ ALT ] &gt; 1.5X upper limit normal range ) . Impaired renal function ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 60mL/min ) . Any underlying acute disease require regular medication could possibly pose threat subject make implementation protocol interpretation study result difficult . History alcohol drug abuse . Mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope possible consequence study . Inability comply protocol , e.g . uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit , unlikelihood completing study .</criteria>
