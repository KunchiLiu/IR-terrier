	<detailed_description>Patients receive least 6 8 cycle R-CHOP 14 R-CHOP 21 regimen 6 R-CHOP-14 -21 complete 2 Rituximab alone accordance local preference . Patients register participate study two time point : - At time initial diagnosis study enrolment ( signature inform consent ) first cycle treatment R-CHOP . - At randomization ( signature inform consent ) treatment first line R-CHOP reach least PR CR . Evaluation response R-CHOP must accordance Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma ( 2007 ) . Stratification : Before randomization , patient stratify accord country response R-CHOP ( PR v CR ) . Randomization : Patients CR/PR R-CHOP randomize maintenance therapy lenalidomide placebo .</detailed_description>
