	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) . ( Group A ) II . Efficiency neurosphere generation pretreatment RO4929097 ( gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 ) . ( Group B ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Radiographic response rate . ( Group A ) II . Toxicities associate regimen . ( Group A ) III . Overall survival . ( Group A ) IV . Expression level Notch pathway component downstream target . ( Group B ) V. Tumor propagation . An extension lifespan 50 % tumor bearing mouse ( mice bearing fresh tumor tissue ) . ( Group B ) VI . Patient event-free survival correlation expression level Notch pathway component downstream target . VII . 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) . VIII . Toxicities associate regimen . IX . Overall survival . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP A : Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 , 22-24 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . GROUP B ( surgical resection indicate ) : Patients receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD day -6 -1 . Patients undergo surgical resection day 0 . Within 30 day surgical resection , patient receive gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 Group A . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
