	<brief_title>Sunitinib Plus Temsirolimus Patients With Renal Cell Cancer ( RCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Sunitinib design block pathway control important event ( growth blood vessel ) essential growth cancer . Temsirolimus design block growth cancer cell , may cause cancer cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level combination sunitinib temsirolimus base join study . There 2 stage study . Up 5 dose level study drug combination test Stage 1 . Two ( 2 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . During Stage 2 , different dos individual study drug test base high tolerable combination dose find Stage 1 . Study Drug Administration : During 3-week `` study cycle , '' take sunitinib 1 time day ( either without food ) 2 week follow 1 week rest study drug . You receive temsirolimus vein 1 time every week 30-60 minute . About 30 minute receive temsirolimus , receive Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) vein 30 minute help prevent side effect . If side effect drug , tell study doctor right away . The study doctor may lower dose keep dose level . Study Visits : Every week ( right receive temsirolimus ) , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test ( addition weekly blood draw described ) . Every 6 week , : - You image scan ( CT and/or MRI scan ) screen visit . If stable disease 2 scan , every 12 week . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check thyroid function . - Urine collect routine test . Blood Pressure Monitoring : During first 3 week study , blood pressure check weekly . This may do local doctor 's office . You write blood pressure time check blood pressure journal study staff give bring see doctor . Length Study : You remain study long benefiting . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : After last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At end-of-study visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You ask side effect may experience since last visit . This investigational study . Sunitinib temsirolimus FDA approve commercially available treatment advance kidney cancer . The use drug combination investigational . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
