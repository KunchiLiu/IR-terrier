	<criteria>Japanese male subject surgically sterile postmenopausal Japanese female subject age 25 75 year . without tear subscapularis labral pathology require surgical repair , estimate close magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) within 3 month surgery . In shoulder study , subject able achieve passive range motion ( ROM ) , least 150 degree forward elevation ( flexion ) , abduction , elevation scapular plane ( scapular abduction ) . Subjects least 40 degree passive ROM external rotation . In contralateral shoulder , subject able achieve active ROM , least 150 degree forward elevation ( flexion ) , abduction , elevation scapular plane ( scapular abduction ) . Subjects least 40 degree active ROM external rotation . Subjects previous surgical intervention shoulder joint study ( eg , shoulder arthroscopy , acromioplasty , previous RCR , fracture ) . Subjects stage 3 4 fatty infiltration ( accord Goutallier grade scale ) RC muscle MRI take within 3 month prior surgical repair subject moderate severe degenerative glenohumeral arthritis ( accord Samilson Prieto arthrosis grade scale ) , avascular necrosis , calcific tendonitis , chondrocalcinosis , hypertrophic osteoarthropathy , Paget disease shoulder study bone abnormality ( eg , HO , previous fracture ) confirm radiograph within 3 month prior surgical repair . Subjects rheumatologic condition ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylose spondylitis ) affect shoulder joint , autoimmune disorder . Subjects treat 3 corticosteroid injection shoulder study within 1 year prior plan surgery subject treat corticosteroid injection shoulder study within 3 month prior plan surgery subject currently receive oral corticosteroid take within past 3 month . Subjects either unwilling unable ( eg , claustrophobia presence automatic cardioverter defibrillator ) undergo examination close MRI . Subjects major illness/condition substantially increase risk associate subject 's participation completion study .</criteria>
