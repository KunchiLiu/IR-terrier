	<brief_summary>Background : - Severe atopic dermatitis , also know eczema , chronic inflammatory skin condition affect child adult cause severe itch skin redness . Current treatment atopic dermatitis include topical cream lotion , light therapy , medication . However , difficulty long-term treatment chronic severe nature disease require effective better-tolerated therapeutic option . - Anakinra drug block substance call interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , may important cause inflammation atopic dermatitis . Researchers interested determine whether anakinra use help treat atopic dermatitis . Anakinra approve Food Drug Administration treat rheumatoid arthritis adult child , approve use adult child atopic dermatitis consider experimental treatment study . In study Anakinra administer injection skin every day 3 month Objectives : - To assess safety effectiveness use anakinra treat severe atopic dermatitis child . Eligibility : - Children 10 18 year age diagnose severe atopic dermatitis respond standard treatment . Design : - Initial Screening : Participants initial screen visit complete physical examination medical history , blood urine test , photograph skin , skin biopsy , test require . - Run-in Period : At screen visit , participant receive diary card ask track atopic dermatitis symptom standard treatment 2 month . - Start Treatment : At end 2 month Run-in period participant return inpatient visit ( 2 day ) receive initial dose anakinra watch side effect . During inpatient visit , participant additional examination blood urine test , instruct administer anakinra injection home . Treatment Period : - Participants return week first 2 week treatment , end first month , month follow 2 month , physical exam blood test . Participants ask record symptom relate atopic dermatitis , anakinra administration side effect relate anakinra diary card . The diary card review collect visit.- End Treatment Period : At end 3 month treatment anakinra , participant ask record symptom relate atopic dermatitis diary card . Participants see month 3 month physical exam , blood test review diary card . . The final study visit take place end 3rd month include physical exam , blood test , photograph skin biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Using Anakinra/Kineret Treatment Patients With Severe Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe refractory atopic dermatitis chronic inflammatory pruritic skin condition affect child adult . The disease mark period exacerbation remission . Symptoms atopic dermatitis may resolve adolescence ; however , estimate disease may persist 50 percent affect child well adulthood . Current possible treatment atopic dermatitis include use topical corticosteroid , calcineurin inhibitor , phototherapy , well systemic medication i.e. , methotrexate , cyclosporine , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil interferon gamma . The difficulty long-term treatment disease lie chronic nature associate severe episode . The combination chronicity severity episodes disease demand effective better-tolerated therapeutic option currently available . While pathway allergic inflammation different inflammatory condition , certain element may overlap , provide target immune modulation . One target interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) receptor . The IL-1 receptor play important role development maintenance Th2 response . Genetic , vivo vitro data demonstrate significant role IL-1 signal allergic skin inflammatory condition . This pilot study therefore design assess safety efficacy IL-1ra , natural inhibitor IL-1 receptor , disrupt atopic pathophysiologic pathway . Specifically , treat severe refractory atopic dermatitis associate evidence multiple specific allergic sensitivity . Up 8 patient age 10-30 severe refractory dermatitis enrol . Patients initially evaluate establish diagnosis severe refractory AD evidence SCORAD score great 40 , follow 2 month ( 8 week ) run-in period , 3 month ( 12 week ) treatment period 3mg/kg/day anakinra give subcutaneously , follow 3 month ( 12 week ) post-treatment evaluation period . In order consider evaluable response , patient must receive minimum 67 84 dos ( 80 percent ) anakinra . The primary endpoint lack increase serious infection , secondary endpoint reduction 30 percent SCORAD score , tertiary endpoint cellular phenotypic cytokine responses IL-1 receptor blockade atopic patient .</detailed_description>

Patient known disease immunodysregulation immunodeficiency . 4 . Any chronic medical condition atopic dermatitis , allergy/asthma infection , heart disease , diabetes autoimmunity , investigator opinion , place patient undue risk participate study . 5 . History anaphylactic reaction hypersensitivity anakinra . 6 . The presence certain type acquire abnormality immunity human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , cytotoxic chemotherapy malignancy could ground possible exclusion , opinion investigator , presence disease process interfere evaluate coexist abnormality immunity subject study protocol . 7 . The presence dermatologic diagnosis , investigator 's opinion , consistent atopic dermatitis would impair ability assess drug response . 8 . Has diagnosis active tuberculosis consistent finding PPD skin test , computerize tomography ( CT ) scan Chest xray . Those subject find positive PPD refer back primary care physician appropriate management . 9 . Has receive live vaccine within 4 week prior therapy potential need live vaccine study . 10 . Is unwilling undergo testing procedure associate protocol . 11 . The patient guardian unable unwilling give daily injection .</criteria>
