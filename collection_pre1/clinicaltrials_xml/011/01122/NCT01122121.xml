	<brief_title>Leuprorelin Associated With Radiotherapy Versus Leuprorelin Alone T3 - T4 pT3 ( Biopsy ) N0 , M0 Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call leuprorelin SR. Leuprorelin SR test treat people prostate cancer . This study look overall survival people take leuprorelin SR addition radiation therapy compare take leuprorelin SR . The study enroll approximately 273 patient . Participants randomly assign one two treatment group . - Combined Radiotherapy Hormone Therapy - Hormone Therapy alone . All participant receive leuprorelin injection every 3 month flutamide tablet thrice daily first 30 day part hormone therapy . Participants randomize combined radiotherapy hormone therapy group , also receive radiotherapy 70 +/- 4 Gy 35 fraction rate 5 fraction 2 Gy per week . This multi-center trial conduct France Tunisia . The overall time participate study 8 year . The scheduled duration hormone therapy 3 year arm , additional treatment-free follow-up period 2 year i.e . total follow-up period 5 year . Post-protocol collection information relative survival perform end 5-year follow-up period .</detailed_description>
