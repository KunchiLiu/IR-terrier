	<brief_summary>The use ultrasound image technique regional anaesthesia rapidly become area increase interest . It represent one large change field regional anaesthesia see . For first time , operator able view image target nerve directly , guide needle real-time observation , navigate away sensitive anatomy , monitor spread local anaesthetic ( LA ) .The key successful regional anaesthesia deposition LA accurately around nerve structure . In past , electrical stimulation rely surface landmark identification , use . However , landmark technique limitation ; variation anatomy nerve physiology , well equipment accuracy effect success rate complication . However , alongside enthusiasm ultrasound guidance regional anaesthesia , degree inform scepticism . The widespread use various technique ultrasound-guided regional block without adequate training raise danger malpractice subsequent impair outcome . Adequate education use regional block technique ultrasound guidance essential . Recent technical development achieve high ultrasound frequency well image resolution , well well post-processing user-friendliness . The purpose study determine whether new technical feature reference image , high ultrasound frequency , good image resolution small size weight ultrasound probe may improve outcome ( clinical benefit ) may show increased efficacy safety . And new technology ultrasound image improves train quality trainee novice art ultrasound-guided block .</brief_summary>
