	<detailed_description>In accordance carbohydrate-based model feed , one may expect food choice well `` like '' `` want '' ( two component reward system ) could influence glycogen store carbohydrate-to-fat balance . More precisely , one may expect high fat oxidation rate could increase like want carbohydrate replenish glycogen store conversely , high carbohydrate oxidation rate could produce reverse . In order validate hypothesis , present study conduct investigate human influence carbohydrate-to-fat oxidation ratio carbohydrate-to-fat selection food reward system .</detailed_description>
