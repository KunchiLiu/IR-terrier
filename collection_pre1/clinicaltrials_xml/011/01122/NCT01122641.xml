	<detailed_description>After food intake , insulin secretion depend degree glycemia , also secretion insulinotropic effect gut hormone , gastric inhibitory polypeptide ( glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ; GIP ) glucagon-like polypeptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , know incretins . Normally , incretins GLP-1 GIP responsible much half glucose-dependent insulin release food ingestion . In obesity patient insulin resistance GIP GLP-1 response mixed meal impaired latter case relate degree insulin resistance [ 1 , 2 ] . In subject type 2 diabetes , insulin release action GIP reduce , however GLP-1 responsiveness normal [ 3 ] . This result successful use therapy either increase endogenous GLP-1 ( inhibit breakdown dipeptidyl-peptidase IV ; DPP-IV ) administer synthetic GLP-1 order treat hyperglycaemia type 2 diabetes . It widely recognise , however , diabetes insulin resistance adversely impact vascular function , independently hyperglycaemia , result premature ischaemic heart disease , stroke , retinopathy lead blindness , renal failure peripheral vascular disease . Dysfunction vasculature , macro- microcirculation , well described people diabetes . Further , alter vascular function demonstrate individual predispose diabetes , example subject fast hyperglycaemia [ 4 ] , impair glucose tolerance [ 5 ] , woman previous gestational diabetes [ 6 ] , obese individual [ 7 , 8 ] 3 month old infant low birth weight [ 9 ] . Unpublished data laboratory demonstrates capillary pressure positively associate fovea ( macular ) thickness , thicken early pre-clinical sign macular oedema , healthy subject wide range body mass index ( BMI ) vary lean morbidly obese ( 20.0 - 46.6 m2/kg ) . In patient establish retinopathy treatment reduce fovea thickness associate improvement visual acuity , whereas increase fovea thickness associate trend towards poorer eyesight [ 10 ] . Microangiopathy appear precede development cardiovascular event diabetes [ 11 ] , change microvascular function appear precede microangiopathy [ 12 , 13 ] . Therapies improve clinically detectable evidence microangiopathy , microalbuminuria , demonstrate improvement cardiovascular outcome independent antihypertensive effect [ 14-16 ] . In latter study linear relationship reduction albumin excretion rate cardiovascular outcome independent intervention suggest microangiopathy integral aetiopathogenesis cardiovascular disease . Thus may possible improve vascular function , example lower capillary pressure , may able prevent delay progression clinical vascular complication ( eg macular oedema increase risk cardiovascular disease ) individual risk diabetes . In case administration therapy improve glycaemic control vascular function enormous health benefit . There grow evidence GLP-1 may favourable effect vascular function , independent glucose lower effect . GLP-1 administration animal model show mediate endothelial dependent relaxation rat pulmonary artery [ 17 , 18 ] , attenuate presence nitric oxide synthase blocker suggest involvement nitric oxide ( NO ) mediate vascular effect . This supported observation GLP-1 promotes NO-dependent relaxation mouse mesenteric artery [ 19 ] . This vary vascular bed , cause endothelial independent relaxation , via GLP-1 receptor , femoral artery [ 20 ] impact rat aorta isolate [ 17 ] . GLP-1 also protective ischaemia-reperfusion injury isolate rat heart [ 19 , 21-24 ] renoprotective ( reduce proteinuria microalbuminuria ) effect , addition , cardio protective effect Dahl salt sensitive hypertensive rat [ 25 ] . Whether effect mediate directly via GLP-1 receptor unclear , vasodilatory effect observe dependent [ 20 ] independent [ 19 ] GLP-1 receptor . In latter study GLP-1 ( 9-36 ) , product degradation GLP-1 dipeptidyl peptidase-IV ( DPP-IV ) , mediate relaxation mouse mesenteric artery [ 19 ] . Thus clearly evident GLP-1 act vasodilator cardio protective property . Work human still embryonic stage , although literature look similarly promising . Acute administration GLP-1 increase flow mediate dilatation ( endothelial dependent ) type 2 diabetic male subject coronary artery disease significant effect young healthy , lean male subject [ 26 ] . In broad general population sample age 18-50 , GLP-1 improve forearm blood flow ( approx 30 % increase ) augment endothelial dependent forearm blood flow response acetylcholine ( approx 40 % increase ) [ 27 ] . Conversely , endothelial independent function influence acute administration GLP-1 either diabetic healthy individual [ 26 , 27 ] . GLP-1 infusion also show improve regional global leave ventricular function administer within 6 hour acute myocardial infarction improve systolic function successful primary angioplasty severe leave ventricular dysfunction [ 28 ] . Much work complete use direct administration GLP-1 mimetic , however , clinical practice , patient tolerability repeat subcutaneous injection limit utilisation early stage diabetes . There little work date explore role DPP-IV inhibition vascular function . It reasonable assume effect DPP-IV inhibitor ( `` gliptins '' ) impressive direct GLP-1 administration , low level GLP-1 achieve , however long term therapy tolerable acceptable , due simple oral administration good side-effect profile . It crucial , therefore , determine whether agent prompt clinically relevant improvement vascular function thereby attenuate inevitable cardiovascular decline observe insulin resistance , would necessarily alter current prescribing pathway guideline . Study Question This study aim explore effect DPP-IV inhibitor , vildagliptin , range macro- microvascular parameter . Specific hypothesis test include : 1. increase incretin activity administration DPP-IV inhibitor vildagliptin low capillary pressure improve microvascular function ( skin maximum microvascular blood flow , endothelial dependent independent function ) insulin resistant individual . 2. improved microvascular function accompany reduction macular thickness ( reduce macular oedema ) microalbuminuria , recognise surrogate early diabetic retinopathy renal failure respectively . 3. administration vildagliptin improve macrovascular function ( flow mediate dilatation arterial stiffness ) insulin resistant individual .</detailed_description>
