	<brief_title>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) History Assessment In SpaiN ( CHAIN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study need ascertain natural history progression COPD , good define phenotype . These two aspect consider fundamental proper evaluation current ( future ) COPD treatment option , could possibly justify limited impact recent major drug trial . Currently , remain gaps natural history patient COPD . Most data analysis mild COPD patient smoker , usually measure fall FEV1 , significant limitation design interpretation . Studies severe patient COPD also conduct mainly study lung function , possibly influence recommendation current guideline disease management . In recent year , longitudinal data change exercise capacity , imaging , biomarkers , among variables interest , knowledge yet partial . The research project CHAIN ( COPD Assessment History Spain ) : `` A Multidimensional Study Evolution Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) multicenter observational study follow prospectively two cohort : ) COPD group active former smoker ( COPD cohort ) b ) group active smoker former smoker without COPD ( control cohort ) . Both cohort follow period least 5 year , visit every 12 month ( phone control least every 6 month ) . We try extend monitoring cohort 10 year . CHAIN support PII COPD SEPAR</detailed_description>
