	<detailed_description>National recommendation state patient history transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) ischemic stroke receive hypertension treatment , include antihypertensive medication lifestyle modification , goal reduce blood pressure ( BP ) &lt; 120 mm Hg systolic BP &lt; 80 mm Hg diastolic BP . Statin treatment lifestyle modification also recommend post-stroke post-TIA patient elevate cholesterol level history stroke TIA atherosclerotic cause . Despite clear benefit secondary stroke prevention , gap evidence implementation clinical practice . We determine whether telephone-delivered behaviorally tailor intervention ( TI ) lead sustain change result ( ) BP lipid control ( b ) improve adherence diet , medication , exercise recommendation veteran history stroke TIA compare attention placebo ( AP ) veteran complete 6 month clinical trial . In CDA project , evaluate long-term effectiveness booster session randomize manner . One arm receive 6 month tailor intervention ( TI ) follow two booster TI session 8 10 month , one arm receive 6 month attention placebo ( AP ) follow two booster AP session 8 10 month . BP ( 3 measure take least 5 min apart ) dietary sodium primary outcome , secondary outcome total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio , adherence antihypertensive lipid-lowering drug , exercise adherence .</detailed_description>
