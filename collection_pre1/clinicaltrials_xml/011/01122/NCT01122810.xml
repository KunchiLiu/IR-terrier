	<detailed_description>Background : Heart transplantation major advance care patient terminal heart failure . But , despite spectacular prognosis improvement obtain treatment , coronary vasculopathy remain leading cause decrease survival first year post-transplantation ( 8 % death 1 year , 42 % 5 year ) . This coronary artery disease ( CAD ) particular feature involve immunological inflammatory process , also favour classical risk factor context immunosuppression , rapid diffuse involvement . Because denervation transplant heart , remain mainly asymptomatic let non invasive stress test poor accuracy CAD screening . It explain current use systematic coronary angiogram transplant heart recipient 's survey . But coronary angiogram remain invasive technique expose potential serious adverse event . The recent advance coronary multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) may allow non invasive visualization coronary tree . Indeed , 64-row CT already show accuracy screen CAD symptomatic patient sinus rhythm . However , study set heart transplantation small sample size mainly use 16-row CT. Only two small sample size study ( 20 patient ) conduct use 64-row CT set heart transplant recipient . None compare X-Ray contrast iodine exposure . Aim : Our primary aim compare diagnostic accuracy value 64-row CT 256-row CT gold standard ( conventional coronary angiogram ) set CAD screen large population heart transplant recipient ( = 110 pt ) . We make assumption sensitivity CT enough allow switch coronary angiogram CT screen asymptomatic CAD heart transplant recipient without CAD CAD suitable revascularization . We plan also compare X-Ray contrast agent exposure . Methods : All transplant heart patient systematically follow cardiovascular thoracic surgery service prospectively include . All patient sign inform consent , CT perform 24 H coronary angiogram . multidetector coronary compute tomography : The Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) -gated contrast-enhanced multidetector compute tomography coronary angiography perform 64 256-row CT Philips , Brilliance . The contrast medium ( Iomeron* , ioméprol , Bracco-Altana Pharma GmbH ) mean quantity use 80-100 ml . The CT scan parameter , adapt patient 's weight , include 120 kV , 800mA , 0.625 mm slice thickness , 0.42-s rotation time 0.2 pitch . To determine X-Ray exposure , Dose Length Product ( Gycm ) measure . After scan , reconstruction perform 40 75 % cycle use ECG gating . Additional reconstruction different phase perform case coronary calcification motion artefact . A semi quantitative analyse ( N=normal , I=intermediate , S=stenosis ) coronary narrow perform blindly coronary angiogram result two experienced radiologist . The CT quality determine use quality scale ( scale 1 5 ) . A Calcification score also determine . A segment analyse perform accord AHA classification ( 17 segment model ) . Only 1.5 mm diameter vessel segment analyse . Coronary angiogram : According good practice , patient receive 0.9 % saline serum intravenously dose 1000 ml per 12 H 1000 ml per 12 H contrast medium injection . Coronary angiogram perform accord standard protocol , use radial access 4 5 French sheath continuous invasive survey blood pressure ECG monitoring . The contrast medium quantity use ( Hexabrix* , sodium méglumine ioxaglate , Guerbet ) X-Ray dose era product ( Gy.cm² ) measure . Quantitative coronary analysis perform two experienced interventional cardiologist blind CT result . Significant stenosis define &gt; 50 % vessel narrowing . Serum creatinine control day , day 72 H coronary angiogram . Statistical analysis : Comparison two technique do segment , artery patient determination sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value CT screen significant coronary stenosis ( &gt; 50 % ) . Statistical analysis make Statview 5.0 . Ethical comity : All patient receive sign inform consent . The ethical comity ( CPP Ile-de-France VI ) approve protocol French Society Cardiology support study . Expected Calendar : We plan perform CT systematic annual hospitalisation invasive coronary angiogram . In cardiovascular department , approximately 8 patient benefit coronary angiogram per week . Thus plan include 110 patient within 30 month , take account exclusion criterion availability technique .</detailed_description>
