	<brief_summary>The Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center conduct clinical research study ass use medication metformin improve quality life , exercise capacity , improve outcome patient heart failure diabetes . If participate study , receive drug metformin approximately 3 month . During study undergo comprehensive test include blood draw , echocardiogram , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ( pacemaker defibrillator ) . You also fill questionnaire keep blood glucose log . You must 18 year old participate . The study drug , study follow—up visit , laboratory test provide free charge . Participants reimburse $ 200 time travel expense .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Management Diabetes With Metformin In Patients With Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) affect 5 million individual United States include 10 % elderly person &gt; 75 year . HF mortality high , approximately 20 % 1-year risk death ( 1 ) . Diabetes ( DM ) common co-morbidity patient HF , present approximately 25 % stable outpatient 40 % hospitalized patient HF ( 2 ) . Diabetes HF patient associate high mortality ( 3,4 ) . Hyperglycemia independently associate hospitalization HF , long length stay HF hospitalization , well high in-hospital HF mortality ( 5-7 ) . Furthermore , HF patient symptoms bad functional status likely insulin resistance ( 8,9 ) . Despite abundance evidence link diabetes , insulin resistance , hyperglycemia impair functional status bad outcome patient HF , lack data guideline optimal strategy manage diabetes patient chronic HF . In retrospective study , many diabetes medication HF associate harm include insulin , thiazolidinediones , sulfonylurea ( 10 ) . The anti-hyperglycemic medication associate retrospective study benefit patient HF diabetes metformin , recently `` black box warning '' HF lift FDA , although physician unaware change labeling ( 10-12 ) . Our analysis data 401 advance , systolic HF patient DM follow Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center also find metformin therapy associate improvement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) well decrease 1-year mortality ( figure 1 ) ( 13 ) . Glycemic control HF patient prospectively study ; however , improved glycemic control potential benefit HF , include improvement myocardial glucose utilization , decrease potentially cardiotoxic free fatty acid , reduce accumulation myocardial collagen advance glycation end-products ( 14,15 ) . Metformin therapy , compare insulin antidiabetic medication , potentially beneficial mechanism action HF include insulin sensitization , improvement lipid profile , efficient myocardial metabolism ( 16,17 ) . The purpose study gather pilot data anticipate comprehensive study DM management HF , goal NIH funding .</detailed_description>
