	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 180 million people worldwide diabetes . This number likely double 2030 . Further , WHO proclaim diabetes cause 5 % death globally year . Cardiovascular event common cause death T2DM patient . According VERONA study , observed 6000 T2DM patient 10 year , 44 % death cause CVD , primarily heart attack stroke . Interesting fact male diabetic 2 3 fold risk CVD whereas female T2DM patient 3 7 fold risk suffer cardiovascular event although satisfy explanation phenomenon . CVD cause atherosclerosis , condition arise ED . Hence , ED represent important diagnostic prognostic parameter estimate cardiovascular risk early state . Such ED frequently cause reduce bioactivity NO . This molecule synthesize endothelial cell oxidation L-arginine reaction catalyze endothelial nitric oxide synthase . NO able protect vessel wall due vasodilatating , anti-adhesive anti-proliferative activity . Experimental clinical study demonstrate T2DM closely associate ED , may consequence reduce bioactivity NO . Central mechanisms explain defect T2DM inactivation NO reactive oxygen specie , reduction amount co-factors necessary NO-synthesis , biopterin NADPH , well inhibition endothelial NO-synthase phosphorylation ( protein kinase C ) O-glycosylation ( hexosamine pathway ) . Endostatin ( ENST ) , anti-angiogenetic factor , block endothelial cell proliferation migration , induce endothelial cell apoptosis inhibit thereby angiogenesis . Basal plasma level ENST high T2DM patient thus may miss link explain inactivation NO pro-angiogenetic factor process atherosclerosis . In T2DM , high glucose load blood lead swell basement membrane thus microangiopathy . This favor genesis hypertension due glomerulosclerosis . Eventually , three factor promote increase risk heart attack stroke : 1 . Hypertension 2 . Increase VLDL ( due low insulin level ) 3. elevate clot disposition ( due hyperglycemia induce production fibrinogen , coagulation factor V VIII ) . One difficulty T2DM coexistence polyneuropathy . As result symptom angina pectoris stress painless silent infarct frequent often end point CVD progress . Thus , important aim T2DM therapy prevention secondary complication CVD . Therefore , exact adjustment blood glucose ( monitored HbA1c ) play pivotal role prevention . Unfortunately , two third patient T2DM USA Europe find recommended HbA1c span ( 6.5-7.0 % ) . Consequently , oral anti-diabetic medication need permanent adjustment intensification delay progress T2DM . However , metformin sulfonylurea derail optimal treatment unwanted side effect , especially hypoglycemia weight gain . Recently , two peptide hormone , GLP-1 GIP , insulinotropic effect identify . These so-called incretins secrete gastrointestinal tract exposure glucose nutrition . Physiological effect result - increase insulin secretion - inhibition glucagon secretion - reduction body weight . It observe incretin level reduce patient impair glucose tolerance . Thus , therapeutic approach lie within elevation GLP-1 GIP prevent degradation enzyme DPP-4 ( dipeptidylpeptidase 4 ) , so-called gliptins inhibit DPP-4 enzyme . Best result HbA1c reduction achieve gliptins combine metformin , glimepiride pioglitazone . In study , patient T2DM , take metformin first line medication achieve HbA1c 7.0 % intolerance sulfonylurea ( hypoglycemia night ) glitazones ( obesity , weight gain ankle edema ) , routinely get add-on therapy gliptins ( Vildagliptin Sitagliptin ) second line therapy accord guideline Österreichische Diabetes Gesellschaft ( ÖDG ) prescribe medical doctor involve study . This medication ÖDG standard therapy T2DM , patient receive anyway despite study . Therefore , therapy gliptins study medication influence study either . Only patient , meet inclusion criterion study voluntarily participate study , investigate . Rationale study This study aim investigate effect modern oral anti-diabetic medication accord guideline ÖDG ED . A special focus put outcome female male patient elucidate different effect drug inflammatory parameter woman men . The following parameter measure : - Catecholamine ( norepinephrine , dopamine , epinephrine ) Catecholamines release adrenal gland situation stress psychological stress , physical stress low blood sugar level . They water-soluble 50 % bound plasma protein . The three major catecholamine circulate blood epinephrine , norepinephrine dopamine . They mainly produce adrenal medulla postganglionic fiber sympathetic nervous system . The measurement catecholamines serf control parameter apply stress situation . - ENST ENST , 20-kDa C-terminal fragment derive type XVIII collagen , endogenous protein block formation blood vessel . It inhibit endothelial cell proliferation , migration angiogenesis . There evidence several function neovascularisation plaque growth maintain perfusion beyond limit diffusion artery lumen outer adventitial vas vasorum , deposit pro-atherogenic plasma molecule , recruit immune cell progenitor , promote intraplaque hemorrhage . ENST , angiostatic factor , might weapon choice battle effect . - BNP Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) 32-amino acid peptide . It synthesize predominantly leave ventricle heart 108-amino acid pro-hormone preproBNP ( -BNP ) . The hormone potent vasodilator natriuretic factor regulate salt water homeostasis . BNP store human cardiac tissue mainly BNP-32 lesser amount precursor preproBNP . The circulate plasma form BNP BNP-32 NH2-terminal portion proBNP ( Nt-proBNP ) . Increased secretion BNP Nt-proBNP occur mainly increased tension ventricular wall , decrease oxygen supply , acute myocardial infarction , chronic cardiac heart failure , hypertrophy heart . The Nt-proBNP level show significantly elevate cohort patient T2DM . Taken together , BNP Nt-proBNP serve sensitive marker CVD . - Intima-media thickness ( carotid-ultrasound ) IMT measurement thickness artery wall , usually external ultrasound , detect presence track progression atherosclerotic lesion . Cross-sectional association common carotid artery IMT cardiovascular risk factor demonstrate several study . - Heart rate - Blood pressure - ECG</detailed_description>
