	<brief_summary>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) safe , noninvasive investigation patient walk treadmill cycle whilst attach ECG mask measure air breathe . It numerous clinical us , diagnose main cause patient breathlessness , decide time heart transplantation assess whether patient safe general anaesthetic . A patient 's peak oxygen consumption , maximum amount oxygen take blood lung breathe increase exercise , main measurement take CPET . It low heart disease use predict risk death therefore plan treatments patient . However also low numerous disease include lung diseaseÍ¾ reduce oxygen consumption patient two condition may wrongly think heart lead inappropriate action distress patient . Newer measurement exercise capacity exercise test well predict death heart failure . We propose specific heart failure disease , example lung disease , compare peak oxygen consumption , superior single best test heart failure require . This research aim identify measurement exercise capacity specific heart failure . We perform test many patient different disease , procedure implantation special pacemaker , heart valve operation . This lead accept use investigation appropriate identification patient procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Ideal Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test Parameter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure , heart muscle damage unable pump blood efficiently , affect 9 % age 55 responsible 2 % hospital admission UK . The first symptom many patient complain breathlessness exercise inability perform normal daily activity . Unfortunately symptoms similar experience numerous disease heart lung . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing , measure numerous value take breathe exercise tell u disease cause symptom . The lead parameter CPET , peak VO2 , many year single value use guide management patient follow diagnosis many disease heart lung . Newer measure predict outcome heart failure ( principal area interest ) well . We believe may less affected lung disease peak VO2 know many patient heart lung disease . By show best CPET variable individual disease state , able ensure patient correctly put level risk condition followed-up accurate marker exercise testing , rather `` one size fit '' approach peak VO2 . With regard heart valve disease , standard exercise test use ECG lead , rather cardiopulmonary exercise testing , start use identify patient without symptom possible surgery . The inaccuracy test inevitably lead patient wrongly categorise . Cardiopulmonary exercise test much accurate way establish impact disease heart lung traditional exercise test therefore believe evidence role around time surgery could use support role improve decision make patient . Ultimately great knowledge test use help patient common heart condition treat appropriately , potentially help many patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Aged 18 year age . 2 . Able perform cycle ergometry agree perform 2 3 test . 3 . If previously undergone echocardiography evidence reasonable echo window ( good view ) . 4 . Agree full study protocol . 1 . Significant coexistent pathology group test unless specifically group mixed pathology `` Observational Study '' . This include combination COPD restrictive lung disease alongside heart failure valvular disease . Therefore cardiac condition significant limitation spirometry , patient lung disease good leave ventricular function significant increase pulmonary vascular pressure see echocardiography . Patients atrial fibrillation/ flutter exclude . Patients mild valvular lesion exclude group except joint group group mitral valvular disease 2 . Symptomatic coronary disease , significant ischaemia note cardiopulmonary exercise test ( unless account aortic valve disease , case prior coronary angiogram would undertake significant coronary disease invite participate ) . 3 . Anaemia ( Hb &lt; 12 men , &lt; 11 woman ) . 4 . Obesity ( BMI &gt; 30 ) could lead limitation independent cardiovascular respiratory condition . 5 . Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 3 ( estimate GFR &lt; 60ml/hr calculate Cockcroft Gault equation ) . The metabolic acidosis associate condition affect ventilatory equivalent . 6 . Poor echocardiographic window full data set achievable . 7 . Inability perform symptom limit cardiopulmonary exercise test . 8 . Inability perform spirometry . 9 . Inability consent/make decision ( lack competence ) 10 . Vulnerable adult/current detainee prison/elsewhere . 11 . Significant neurological musculoskeletal abnormality . 12 . Inability complete investigation time interval agree protocol . 13 . Permanent Pacemaker unless biventricular pacemaker group Interventional Study . These patient group exclude pace dependent ( biventricular function disable normal intrinsic rhythm ) significant first degree AV block rest exercise ( activate right ventricular pace sinus beat ) . 14 . Patients atrial fibrillation interventional group exclude revert back atrial fibrillation procedure , procedure never restore sinus rhythm . These patient still eligible inclusion observational study . 15 . Recent ( recovery within &lt; 1month ) decompensation underlie cardiac respiratory disorder . 16 . Uncontrolled hypertension . 17 . Untreated life threaten arrhythmia . 18 . Recent surgery ( within 10 week ) .</criteria>
