	<brief_summary>Lung transplantation ( LT ) establish treatment option patient wide variety end-stage lung diseases- aim improve quality life survival . Pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) widely recognize important component care patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , improve dyspnea , exercise tolerance , quality life , reduces healthcare resource utilization . The goal pulmonary rehabilitation follow lung transplantation enhance physiological functional benefit result surgery . Inspiratory muscle Training ( IMT ) define intervention goal train inspiratory muscle . IMT improve inspiratory muscle strength , endurance exercise capacity adult COPD . IMT provide additional benefit patient undergoing PR program worthwhile even patient already undergone general exercise reconditioning ( GER ) program . IMT provide additional benefit ( together without ) PR patient follow lung transplantation . No formal guideline exist regard optimal method exercise train component pulmonary rehabilitation patient recover lung transplantation . This study evaluate unique influence IMT Patients Following Lung Transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Rehabilitation Inspiratory Muscle Training ( IMT ) Patients Following Lung Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The post lung transplant patient participate rehabilitation program 6 month . Participants propose study belong one four intervention group : 1 . Conventional regular pulmonary rehabilitation program alone ( exercise program consist 3 main component : aerobic conditioning , resistance training , flexibility exercise ) . 2 . Very low load IMT ( sham IMT ) alone . 3 . Conventional regular pulmonary rehabilitation program + Targeted inspiratory resistive threshold IMT . 4 . Targeted inspiratory resistive threshold IMT alone .</detailed_description>
