	<brief_summary>Management type 2 diabetes ongoing challenge patient doctor . In order prevent short long term complication , patient need monitor control blood sugar level . In addition , may need ongoing communication doctor order modify treatment . In study investigator wish compare two system monitor communication blood sugar level . The first use continuous glucose monitoring system second use Internet-based glucose monitoring system . The investigator want compare effect and/or benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring System Continuous Glucose Monitoring System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To compare benefit Internet-based glucose monitoring system Continuous Glucose monitoring system patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Hypothesis : The investigator propose benefit Internet-based glucose monitoring system ( IBGMS ) comparable benefit Continuous Glucose monitoring system ( CGMS ) patient type 2 DM . Justification : Half subject standard treatment , involve glucose monitoring test blood glucose 3 time daily , perform laboratory test blood hemoglobin every three month , visit doctor every three month standard care . They also use internet system report glucose reading , allow health care profession view result provide feedback . The half use continuous glucose monitoring system , involve minimum test blood glucose least 2 time day calibrate sensor , perform laboratory test blood hemoglobin every three month , visit doctor every three month standard care . All subject standard care ; Research Method : Type 2 diabetes patient satisfy inclusion criterion recruit St. Paul 's Diabetes Teaching Training Centre . They randomize 2 group ( IBGMS CGMS ) . There equal chance , 50/50 chance , place either group . The IBGMS group receive standard care ask perform self-blood glucose monitoring 3 time daily 6 month . The IBGMS group also ask report blood glucose reading every 2 week Internet base glucose monitoring system . The IBGMS group make visit endocrinologist every 3 month A1c serum creatinine measurement 3-month interval 6 month . The CGMS group also receive standard care ask perform self-blood glucose monitoring least 2 time day 6 month calibrate sensor.The CGMS group also use internet system generate report blood glucose reading use patient 's preference . Their reading also send endocrinologist feedback every 2 week . The CGMS group make visit endocrinologist every 3 month A1c serum creatinine measurement 3-month interval 6 month . The laboratory measurement group record use data analysis . Statistical Analysis : The primary endpoint A1c level change A1c level . The secondary endpoint include severe hypoglycemia define require external aid , hospital admission CVD relate intervention , adverse event unplanned hospitalization cause last 24 hour . Patients required number SMBG ( Self monitor blood glucose ) test perform patient require new laser therapy ask discontinue study . For group , A1C level start study compare A1C level 3 6 month start study . Paired t-tests random effect model ( longitudinal analysis ) examine difference A1C value study duration . Unpaired , independent t-tests do examine difference A1C value two group intervention . The planned sample size 50 .</detailed_description>
