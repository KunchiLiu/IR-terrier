	<brief_summary>The investigator hop discover cause chest pain patient normal coronary arteriogram . For patient chest pain coronary angiography standard method blood vessel heart visualize narrow assess . In case investigator find totally normal coronary blood vessel minor disease . Such finding associate excellent long term prognosis . However , large proportion patient normal coronary artery mild coronary narrowing often continue experience recurrent chest pain investigator interested understanding mechanism responsible . The investigator hypothesise many case , coronary artery spasm responsible recurrent chest pain . These spasm usually respond treatment drug know vasodilator . The acetylcholine test ( ACH-test ) recommend European Society Cardiology American College Cardiology diagnostic test . This test reveal whether coronary blood vessel tendency go spasm . The investigator plan study carry test patient chest pain suggestive coronary narrowing find normal mildly narrow coronary artery angiography . A positive test -indicating tendency spasm- may help guide therapy vasodilator , often effective prevent coronary spasm . The investigator would also like take blood sample test ( ) every patient measure blood marker see relation marker result ACH-test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Markers Inflammation Coronary Artery Vasoreactivity Testing Patients With Chest Pain Normal Coronary Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study comprise two part : 1 . Blood sample 2 . ACH-test ( include coronary flow measurement ) Blood take , frozen store 5 year . The following marker study : C-reactive protein , E-selectin , neopterin , troponin CD40 ligand . These essential biochemical marker call pro-inflammatory substance normally circulate blood level increase certain condition stress inflammation . In addition , expansion CD4+CD28null T-cells measure via flow cytometry . Coronary angiography perform accord routine clinical guideline . If investigator find severe disease standard treatment procedure take place investigator ask blood sample . If investigator find normal coronary artery coronary angiography investigator conduct ACH-test part study . After inject ACH coronary artery narrow occur provoke similar symptom home ( i.e . chest pain ) . If experience severe pain investigator inject drug call nitroglycerine relieve pain . Then investigator measure capacity blood vessel dilate special catheter . The whole procedure include coronary angiography ACH-test last one hour . There little radiation need ACH-test unlikely cause health problem ( ~2.4mSv ) . In rare case chest pain prolonged heart rhythm disorder occur . In bad case prolong narrow lead heart attack ( myocardial infarction , &lt; 1 % ) . The result ACH-test lead 3 different result . 1 . Epicardial coronary spasm . This mean narrowing blood vessel occur place see screen angiography . 2 . Microvascular dysfunction This mean narrowing blood vessel see screen ECG . It affect small blood vessel heart . 3 . Normal ACH-test This mean test normal patient chest pain test also narrow . Depending result investigator suggest start medication accord current guideline inform patient 's GP result suggestion treatment . To maintain confidentiality participant enter onto secure database use initial study number .</detailed_description>
