	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) far common disorder group irreversible cause visual disability . AMD lead dysfunction loss photoreceptors central retina . Neovascular AMD ( nAMD ) affect visual function early disease process severely compromise highly developed function macula , perception detail , central fixation , color vision , read ability . AMD-related visual impairment associate loss autonomy quality life . Current therapeutic approach target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , identify main cytokine pathogenesis nAMD . Ranibizumab , fab-fragment antibody target VEGF approve treatment nAMD apply intravitreally monthly interval disease activity stop . However , significant proportion patient nAMD suffer persistent recur disease need continuous anti-VEGF therapy month year , often lead irreversible change photoreceptor layer pigment epithelium . Recent study regard treatment nAMD utilized different form therapy , combine photodynamic therapy verteporfin ( PDT ) ranibizumab , well therapeutic regimen contain steroid . Even though study provide evidence combination therapy superior ranibizumab monotherapy , study conduct patient previously untreated nAMD . Therefore , currently alternative therapeutic approach patient recurrent persistent form nAMD multiple treatment ranibizumab monotherapy . The purpose study assess treatment effect reduce fluence PDT intravitreal ranibizumab versus intravitreal dexamethasone ranibizumab versus intravitreal ranibizumab monotherapy patient persistent recurrent choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) due AMD . The investigator hypothesis finding offer new insight management persistent recurrent CNV secondary AMD .</brief_summary>
