	<brief_summary>Sepsis clinical syndrome often cause bloodstream infection result common set symptom term systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Severe sepsis ( sepsis organ failure ) lead cause death critically ill patient US . Most patient severe sepsis need treat intensive care unit mechanical ventilation intravenous antibiotic . Between 30 50 % severe sepsis patient die quality life survivor substantially reduce . New therapy need improve clinical outcome patient sepsis . A new area interest treatment critical illness pharmaconutrition , micronutrient ( like zinc ) study administered determine affect inflammatory response immunologic process critical illness . The FDA regulate micronutrient require rigorous pharmacokinetic ( study drug nutrient metabolize body ) test clear dose micronutrient critically ill patient . It also clear critically ill patient would metabolize micronutrient differently healthy people would need different dosing level . This true zinc , focus research study . Zinc essential normal immune function , oxidative stress response , wound healing , homeostasis tightly regulate . Zinc deficiency occur &gt; 10 % Americans lead loss innate adaptive immunity increase susceptibility infection . The symptom zinc deficiency similar many symptom SIRS strong biologic rationale suggest zinc deficiency see nearly sepsis patient may contribute development sepsis syndrome `` immunoparalysis '' common sepsis patient This study three specific aim , 1 ) perform phase I dose-finding study intravenous zinc mechanically ventilate patient severe sepsis ; 2 ) define pharmacokinetic intravenous zinc mechanically ventilate patient severe sepsis compare healthy control ; 3 ) investigate impact zinc inflammation , immunity , oxidant defense patient severe sepsis . A total 40 critically ill patient FAHC intensive care unit 15 healthy control enrol study . The critically ill patient population divide 4 dose group 10 subject ( 7 randomize zinc 3 saline placebo ) . Group 1 receive 500mcg/kg IBW/day elemental zinc divide dos every 8 hour . If 50th percentile normal plasma zinc range ( 110mcg/dL ) achieve patient 7 day safety concern , sequential group patient receive increase dos 250mcg increment ceiling dose . Groups 2 4 receive 750 , 1000 , 1250mcg/kgIBW/day elemental zinc , respectively . Each participant receive intravenous zinc placebo total 7 day unless die leave ICU earlier . Pharmacokinetic testing obtain 40 critically ill subject 15 healthy control . Additional blood drawn infusion protocol investigate impact zinc inflammation , immunity , oxidant defense .</brief_summary>
