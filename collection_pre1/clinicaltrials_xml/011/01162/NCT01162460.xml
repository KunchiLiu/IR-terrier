	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Eslicarbazepine Acetate Monotherapy Patients With Newly Diagnosed Partial-onset Seizures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epilepsy affect 50 million adult child worldwide . Prevalence estimate total population vary 4 8 per 1000 subject . Anti-epileptic drug ( AEDs ) major intervention approximately 60 % newly diagnose patient seizure free single AED , 40 % satisfactorily control 25 % suffer significant adverse event ( AEs ) . This lack seizure control unsatisfactory tolerability mean still need new , effective AEDs use monotherapy . Given efficacy ESL control partial onset seizure , good tolerability convenience QD dose instead twice daily ( BID ) dosing , ESL could offer beneficial alternative first-line therapy patient newly diagnose epilepsy experience partial-onset seizure . This study aim demonstrate efficacy safety ESL monotherapy treatment patient population prove non-inferiority standard therapy , Carbamazepine control release ( CBZ-CR ) .</detailed_description>
