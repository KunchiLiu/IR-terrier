	<brief_summary>Treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) major health concern , 10 % patient major depressive disorder respond conventional treatment . The investigator propose compare MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) brain scan patient TRD , collect surgical planning deep brain stimulation , age , sex , handedness education-matched healthy volunteer control , investigate anatomical difference , specifically volume certain brain structure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) Scans Patients With Treatment Resistant Depression ( TRD ) Healthy Controls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient treat Frenchay Hospital , UK , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) give Patient Information Sheet , ask would like participate research related condition . If indicate would like participate , patient ask sign separate inform consent form ( ICF ) give permission previously collect MRI scan use new research purpose . Information handedness patient previously collect , patient give short questionnaire determine handedness . The patient require perform task . For patient agrees participate study , two healthy match control participant recruit . Participants recruit exist volunteer database local advertisement . Respondents interested participate give letter invite participant information sheet . They ask several basic question include contact detail , health status , age , sex , handedness , high qualification achieve , scan requirement order ass basic suitability study . If suitable , participant invite attend screening visit . Here , informed consent form sign , medical history take , give MINI neuropsychiatric evaluation assess physical mental status . Females possibility pregnant ask provide urine sample check pregnant , require use adequate contraception scan . If suitable , participant complete two computerised test mood . Then scan date book Frenchay hospital . At scan visit , participant assess change health since screen visit , complete MRI scan . The scanner sequence use healthy control use patient . Two sequence collect : coronal T1 FFE ( fast field echo ) volume acquisition axial high resolution T2 limit volume acquisition 16 slice collect 8 ACPC ( anterior commissure posterior commissure ) plane 8 . These sequence match sequence DBS patient allow automated anatomical quantitative analysis ( use Statistical Parametric Mapping version 5 ( SPM5 ) ) quantitative description MRI signal white matter bright spot . Participants receive payment , printout scan wish . The scan analyse compare patient scan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Up 12 female 4 male , sex , handedness age ( Â±5 year ) match DBS patient . Current past psychiatric disorder assess MINI clinical interview . Significant head injury . Standard MRI risk criterion ( metallic clip pin body , pacemaker , aneurysm clip , pregnancy , possibility metal eye include history traumatic eye injury , shrapnel bullet injury ) . Inability lie scanner whatever reason ( e.g . claustrophobia ) . Current acute medical illness . Started new medicine last two month investigator feel may interfere study . Any medical condition principle investigator 's opinion match DBS sample ( e.g . epilepsy , diabetes , cardiac/hepatic/renal failure hypertension ) . The investigator feel volunteer unsuitable research protocol , unable unwilling comply study procedure .</criteria>
