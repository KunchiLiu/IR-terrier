	<brief_title>1B Intravesical Administration SCH 721015 ( Ad-IFNa ) Admixture With SCH 209702 ( Syn3 ) The Treatment BCG Refractory Superficial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : SCH 72105 design cause `` gene transfer '' give gene call interferon -alpha-2b body . SCH 72105 make process lab study drug call Syn3 . This combination study drug also call SCH 721015 Syn3 . Syn3 design help body make protein call interferon -alpha-2b , may help body 's immune system react cancer . Study Drug Administration : On Days 1 4 , SCH 72105 give bladder 1 minute urinary catheter . A urinary catheter thin flexible tube place urinary tube bladder . SCH 72105 stay bladder 1 hour . You ask turn left right , back stomach , every 15 minute allow bladder surface expose drug . A belladonna opium ( B &amp; O ) suppository insert rectum 30 minute study drug dos . Levsin SL ( hyoscyamine sulfate ) give mouth 15 minute study drug dos . These drug use low risk urinary urgency ( strong need urinate ) . Study Visits : On Day 1 : - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect test IFN level check infection . - Your vital sign measure study drug dose . - You ask side effect urinary symptom may drug may take . - Your performance status record . On Days 2 3 Days 5-14 : - Urine collect biomarker test . Biomarkers urine may relate reaction study drug . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect urinary symptom may drug may take . On Day 4 : - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect biomarker test check infection . - Your vital sign measure study drug dose . - You ask side effect urinary symptom may drug may take . - Your performance status record . During Days 1-11 , add 1/2 cup bleach toilet bowl every time urinate . You wait 15 minute flush . You avoid public bathroom day . This procedure require avoid expose people study drug . One ( 1 ) time week Weeks 2-11 , study staff call ask side effect urinary symptom may drug may take . During call , performance status also record . At Week 12 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Urine collect biomarker test check infection . - Your vital sign measure . - You ECG . This ECG use screen test help doctor decide eligible take part Part 2 study . - Your performance status record . - You ask side effect urinary symptom may drug may take . - You cystoscopy biopsy check status disease . All area doctor think might tumor biopsied . Your bladder also measure procedure . Length Participation : You may receive 2 dos study drug plan , doctor think best interest . You able receive second dose study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Part 2 Study : If disease completely respond Week 12 ( sign cancer ) , ask take part Part 2 study . In Part 2 , participant receive another 2 dos study drug . There separate inform consent form describe Part 2 , include screen test help doctor decide eligible . You ask sign inform consent form agree take part . The level effectiveness SCH72105 treatment study measurement IFN level daily urine collection . End-of-Study Visit : You may choose stop study participation time . If choose stop Week 12 visit , ask return end-of-study visit . You also call study staff ask health 1 time year next 2 year . The following test procedure perform end-of-study visit : - You physical exam . - You ECG . - Urine collect routine test . Follow-Up : If sign bladder cancer Week 12 , study staff call Months 6 , 9 , 12 , 24 , 36 . You ask serious side effect . This investigational study . SCH 72105 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 9 patient take part study ( 9 total , Parts 1 2 ) . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
