	<brief_title>Visualization Structured Attention Behaviour Pain Anxiety Reduction During Ablation Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common form cardiac arrhythmia prevalence 5 % among people older 65 year , 0.4 % total population . Ablation relatively new treatment proven effective remove physical symptom patient severe symptom . Compared ablation treatment , ablation AF complex long duration . It accompany significant discomfort pain , despite pharmacological analgesia . Non pharmacological analgesia form relaxation exercise visualization successfully use reduce experience pain intensity anxiety invasive procedure . Aim : The study test follow hypothesis also act aim intervention : Relaxation visualization perform patient ablation atrial fibrillation combine structured attention behaviour nurse reduce patient 's experience pain anxiety - secondary reduces consumption painkiller number episode adverse outcome require extra attention staff . Design / Methodology : The Trial conduct cardiac lab . The survey conduct controlled Trial . The control group receive conventional care treatment intervention group receive visualization relaxation exercise together structure behavioural attention . The patient score experience pain intensity anxiety validate linear numerical rank scale . A Statistical calculation power estimate required number patient 70 group .</detailed_description>
