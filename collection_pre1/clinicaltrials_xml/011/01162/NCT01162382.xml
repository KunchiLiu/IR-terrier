	<brief_summary>This protocol , `` Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Treatment Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) : A Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fcMRI ) Study , '' open-label pilot treatment study . The purpose present protocol treat participant diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder 4 week rTMS , perform fcMRI EEG study prior follow treatment determine treatment response relate change fcMRI and/or EEG result . The investigator hypothesize patient respond treatment display change functional connectivity pattern think related occurrence depressive symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression accompany rumination support inwardly focus cognitive attention negative event emotion . There evidence indicate one aspect ruminative behavior lie abnormal increase intra-regional connectivity among element default mode network ( DMN ) . It also widely recognize depression associate disturbance cognition include deficit attentional processing , include reduction process speed deficit selective attentional processing consider part executive function . Thus , least equal reason believe attention executive control network might show change intra-regional functional connectivity . Given attentional deficit associate MDD , hypothesize weaken intra-network rest state BOLD functional connectivity ( rs-fcMRI ) addition strengthen connectivity report others.Further , suggest shift intra-regional connectivity extend well-recognized anti-correlated activity two network support intrusion introspective , ruminative think cognitive activity require externally direct attention . To test hypothesis , use fMRI rest state functional connectivity examine shift network connectivity prior follow rTMS treatment depression .</detailed_description>
