	<brief_summary>To establish whether short duration tourniquet application ( cement fixation cement set ) associate well patient functional outcome compare long duration tourniquet application ( surgical incision cement set ) . It hypothesise tourniquet application cement fixation ( approximately 20-30 min duration ) associate less pain impairment longer tourniquet application ( &gt; 45 minute ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short- Versus Long-duration Tourniquet Use During Total Knee Replacement ( TKR )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Tourniquets commonly use total knee replacement ( TKR ) surgery provide bloodless field improve visualisation [ 1 ] . The optimum timing tourniquet release ( ie prior wound closure ) subject many randomise controlled trial recent meta−analysis [ 1 ] conclude whilst early release may increase blood loss , may protect patient regional complication require re−operation wound dehiscence , haematoma require drainage , knee stiffness infection . Thus , good evidence suggest tourniquet use short duration may optimal far complication concern . Few study look effect tourniquet duration functional recovery , one [ 2 ] observe quadriceps lag recover quickly short duration tourniquet use . There research date use tourniquet cement fixation prosthesis good visualisation key prevent blood−cement mix . Such approach important investigate could reduce risk tourniquet use . However , tourniquet use short duration may increase blood loss increase risk donor blood transfusion . Aim : To establish whether short duration tourniquet application ( cement fixation cement set ) associate well outcome compare long duration tourniquet application ( surgical incision cement set ) .Research Design : A randomised control trial use ass research hypothesis . The research hypothesis tourniquet use cement fixation associate well physical functional recovery . However , may associate great need donor blood transfusion . Methods : Consenting patient randomly allocate tourniquet use either short long duration operate theatre patient anaesthetised.The tourniquet apply time first skin incision ( standard practice surgeon involve ) allocate Long−Duration Group , apply cement fixation prosthesis Short−Duration Group . In group , tourniquet remove cement set . Assessments conduct baseline ( 6−weeks surgery pre−admission visit ) , discharge , 2,10 , 26 52 week post surgery . The outcomes interest include patient-centred measure ( Oxford knee score -primary outcome ) physical measure stair climb test quadriceps lag , knee range motion . As risk donor blood transfusion may increase short tourniquet duration , use donor blood also primary outcome . Reinfusion drain use routinely patient order reduce need donor blood . All enrol patient undergo screen leg doppler another 2 week post surgery detection DVTs . Length stay , discharge destination ( home versus rehabilitation ) , also record . Complication type frequency ( include evidence prosthesis loosening first year ) monitor . The study power detect significant difference Oxford score . Thus , sample size 200 patient provide sufficient power ( 80 % ) 0.05 significance level detect 0.5SD difference Oxford score 2 treatment arm . This provide 20 % loss follow-up also provide sufficient number detect large absolute difference ( &gt; 20 % ) transfusion rate group .</detailed_description>
