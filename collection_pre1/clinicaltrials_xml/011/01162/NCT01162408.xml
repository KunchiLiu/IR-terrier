	<brief_summary>Objective : To evaluate compare outcome predictive power Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) Ⅳ、Ⅲ、Ⅱ score system intensive ill patient independent medical intensive care unit ( MICU ) , explore best time point accurately predict outcome . Design : Retrospective analysis medical record . Methods Materials : Collect data patient admit July 2010 July 2013 medical intensive care unit First Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-sen University Guangzhou , China . Patients ICU stay less 4 hour age less 16 year exclude . Calculate APACHE Ⅳ、Ⅲ、Ⅱ score correspond predictive mortality risk first 24 hour ICU admission 3th , 5th , 7th , 14th , 21 th , 28th day day transfer ICU death . The predictive power model assess ratio observe death rate predictive death rate ( Standardized mortality ratio , SMR ) , calibration observe predictive death rate discriminative ability survivor non-survivors . Hosmer-Lemeshow test employ assess calibration discriminative ability assess area receiver operate curve . Compare predictive power three model different time point explore best time point accurately predict outcome .</brief_summary>
