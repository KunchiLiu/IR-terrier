	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency iron deficiency anemia two major public health problem develop country . In country , use monotonous plant-based diet , low animal source food high iron absorption inhibitor phytic acid polyphenol , lead poor iron status aggravate poor iron status cause infection . In many West African country sorghum major source energy , protein , vitamins mineral especially poverty-stricken people . Some sorghum variety know contain high level polyphenols inhibitory effect iron absorption human . Polyphenols huge group plant metabolites vary chemical structure . Depending structure , level complex formation iron intestine thus negative effect iron absorption different . Micronutrient deficiency combat fortification plant-based staple . Fortification promise food-based approach apply strategy fail provide adequate level respective micronutrient diet . To fortify food iron , wide variety different iron compound use . The iron compound sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic ( NaFeEDTA ) overcome inhibitory effect phytate human iron absorption . No information potential enhance effect NaFeEDTA presence polyphenol available . The aim study investigate effect different sorghum polyphenol concentration human iron absorption investigate negative impact polyphenols overcome use NaFeEDTA iron compound . The study include 32 apparently healthy young woman consume sorghum porridge different polyphenol level sorghum porridge fortify ferrous sulfate compare NaFeEDTA . Furthermore test meal add vitamin C add laccase compare control meal . Iron absorption determine stable isotope technique .</brief_summary>
