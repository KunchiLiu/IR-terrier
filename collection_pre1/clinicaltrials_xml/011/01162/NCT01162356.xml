	<brief_summary>Since introduction vitrectomy 1971 , procedure become third frequently perform ophthalmic surgery . Approximately 225,000 vitrectomy perform annually United States indication continue expand . Known long-term complication vitrectomy relatively include retinal detachment cataract formation . Although much write literature concern acute rise intraocular pressure ( IOP ) immediate postoperative period , surprisingly little information long term IOP outcomes vitrectomy . A recent report Chang give LXII ( 62 ) Edward Jackson Memorial Lecture hypothesize causal relationship vitrectomy open-angle glaucoma ( OAG ) via oxidative stress exacerbate removal crystalline lens . A second report Luk colleague report similar conclusion modify cohort . Both study , retrospective nature perform baseline evaluation exclude pre-existing glaucoma . Furthermore neither study account natural history . Finally , analysis reproduce similar result . The primary purpose study analyze full spectrum optic nerve macular change vitrectomized study eye non-vitrectomized fellow eye control natural history . Baseline evaluation include examination fellowship train retina glaucoma specialist , fundus photography , autofluorescence , optical coherence tomography ( macula optic nerve ) automate visual field test . At 3 month annually 5 year vitrectomy surgery , cohort undergo similar evaluation .</brief_summary>
