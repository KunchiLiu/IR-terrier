	<brief_summary>This study base preclinical ( animal ) study show infuse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell spinal fluid may contribute improve neurologic function animal model spinal cord injury . Bone marrow ( BM ) contain several type stem cell produce functional cell . This include cell could help heal process damage neurologic tissue . The primary objective study see injection cell , obtain bone marrow , safe . A secondary objective evaluate treatment provide functional improvement ( neuromuscular control sensation ) affect area .</brief_summary>
