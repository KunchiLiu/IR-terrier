	<brief_summary>Current standard treatment lymphoma involve central nervous system include chemotherapy whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . However , many patient respond treatment , patient respond relapse treatment . Previous research show stem cell transplant patient 's cell ( autologous stem cell transplant ) may effective patient lymphoma involve CNS . In previous research use autologous stem cell transplant lymphoma involve CNS , condition regimen consist drug thiotepa , busulfan cyclophosphamide ( TCE ) use . These drug show enter nervous system . In research study , investigator add drug rituximab ( Rituxan ) drug cytarabine stem cell mobilization process . Cytarabine standard drug mobilization . In addition , rituximab add condition regimen thiotepa , busulfan cyclophosphamide . Rituximab approve FDA treatment type lymphomas , approve use lymphoma involve CNS . Rituximab know able enter CNS . Previous research suggest may help treat lymphoma involves CNS . The goal research study see add rituximab stem cell mobilization condition regimen help treat lymphoma involves central nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If screening procedure confirm eligible participate research study follow procedure . Stem cell mobilization - take place least 9 day prepare donate stem cell autologous transplant . The drug cytarabine , rituximab Neupogen ( G-CSF ) give . You hospital 2 day receive cytarabine infusion ( 1st rituximab infusion day 1 stem cell mobilization ) . Then discharge . You receive Neupogen injection outpatient . Stem cell collection ( leukapheresis ) - When doctor determine stem cell count high enough stem cell collect procedure call leukapheresis . Leukapheresis perform collect blood vein processing machine remove stem cell need produce bone marrow . The rest blood return another vein . The harvested stem cell frozen store . These cell return complete conditioning regimen high dose chemotherapy . Conditioning regimen ( high dose chemotherapy ) - You enter hospital conditioning regimen stay 30 day receive stem cell transplant . The condition regimen help kill cancer cell stem cell transplant take place 9 day . All drug give intravenous ( IV ) . Infusion stem cell ( stem cell transplant ) - Your cell give vein , similar IV infusion . The infusion usually take several hour . After discharge , ask return 4 week , 8 week , 12 week 14 week stem cell transplant . At visit physical exam , question measure mental functioning , blood test . About 14 week stem cell transplant eye exam , echocardiogram , lung function test , whole body PET-CT scan , brain MRI CT scan , MRI CT spinal cord ( patient may lymphoma spinal cord ) , collection cerebral spinal fluid , bone marrow aspiration . You follow-up visit 6 month 4 year stem cell transplant .</detailed_description>
