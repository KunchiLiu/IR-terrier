	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety gemcitabine cisplatin plus Everolimus ( also call RAD001 ) different dose level . We want find effect , good and/or bad , treatment cancer . Gemcitabine cisplatin standard chemotherapy drug commonly use treat advanced urothelial cancer . Everolimus pill work shut pathway cancer cell make tumor grow . Laboratory study show Everolimus appear improve activity cisplatin cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must advance urothelial cancer histologically confirm MSKCC pathology review . Patients may receive prior systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease . Patients may receive prior neoadjuvant adjuvant systemic chemotherapy provide complete ≥ 1 year prior diagnosis metastatic disease . Age ≥ 18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70 . Expected survival least 3 month . Resolution acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgical procedure NCI CTCAE grade ≤ 1 . Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5x 109/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN INR ≤ 1.5 ( &lt; 3 anticoagulant ) ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN patient liver metastasis ) Adequate renal function show : Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL OR Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 use Jelliffe equation : Calculated creatinine clearance = 98 0.8 [ age ( yr ) 20 ] x ( 0.9 female ) Serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) Fasting serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : If patient 's lipid value exceed either one criterion upon screen , patient become eligible successful initiation appropriate lipidlowering medication . After lipidlowering therapy , patient must meet criterion i.e . fast serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL OR ≤ 7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN eligible study treatment . Testing hepatitis B viral load serological marker ( HBVDNA , HBsAg , HBsAb , HBcAb ) follow patient : All patient currently live ( live ) Asia , Africa , Central South America , Eastern Europe , Spain , Portugal , Greece Patients follow risk factor : Known suspect past hepatitis B infection Blood transfusion ( ) prior 1990 Current prior IV drug user Current prior dialysis Household contact hepatitis B infect person ( ) Current prior highrisk sexual activity Body pierce tattoos Mother know hepatitis B History suggestive hepatitis B infection , e.g dark urine , jaundice , right upper quadrant pain Additional patient discretion investigator Testing hepatitis C infection ( use quantitative RNAPCR ) patient follow risk factor : Known suspect past hepatitis C infection ( include patient past interferon `` curative '' treatment ) Blood transfusion ( ) prior 1990 Current prior IV drug user Household contact hepatitis C infect person ( ) Current prior highrisk sexual activity Body pierce tattoos Additional patient discretion investigator Patients currently receive anticancer therapy receive anticancer therapy within 4 week start study drug ( include chemotherapy , radiation therapy , antibody base therapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , etc. ) . Patients major surgery significant traumatic injury within 4 week start study drug , patient recover side effect major surgery ( define require general anesthesia ) , patient may require major surgery course study . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 4 week . Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent , except corticosteroid daily dosage equivalent prednisone ≤ 20 mg . Patients receive corticosteroid must stable dosage regimen minimum 4 week prior first treatment Everolimus . Topical inhale corticosteroid allow .
