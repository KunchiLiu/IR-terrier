	<brief_summary>- Peginterferon alfa-2a approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat adult chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection liver disease previously treat interferon-alpha drug ( improve immune system response infection ) . Ribavirin approve FDA usually give combination interferon drug peginterferon alfa-2a treatment chronic HCV . - Recent research show Latino white respond well treatment peginterferon alfa-2a ribavirin non-Latino white . Various factor excessive weight , gender , insulin resistance evaluate explain difference , research suggest underlie factor related Latino non-Latino background , possibly genetic immune difference , may affect response HCV infection treatment . However , research need effectiveness peginterferon ribavirin Latino subject HCV , combine human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) co-infection . Objectives : - To evaluate safety , effectiveness , viral response peginterferon alfa-2a ribavirin therapy chronic hepatitis C Latino participant without HIV co-infection . This observational study . The observed treatment receive manage primary care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Study Evaluate Chronic Hepatitis C Treatment Latino Subjects With Without HIV Co-infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C major health problem affect 100- 300 million individual worldwide . Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection lead cirrhosis approximately 20 % subject period 1-20 year . Hepatitis C common indication liver transplantation United States . infection occur one-third HIV-infected individual , natural history among HIV-1 infected individual demonstrate high level HCV viremia , fast rate progression cirrhosis . There study address lower therapeutic response rate minority outside African Americans . A recent study show Latino white subject respond less effectively ( 34 % ) non Latino white subject ( 49 % ) give treatment even adjust various important factor . As current landscape treatment HCV change , would important evaluate factor responsible therapeutic response Latino patient . This study address genetic , epigenetic , proteomic expression therapy chronic hepatitis C Latino participant without HIV co-infection . One hundred Latino participant evidence chronic hepatitis C without HIV receive treatment HCV enrol . The result study enable u explore reason differential therapeutic response rate Hepatitis C treatment Latino participant without HIV coinfection .</detailed_description>
