	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) one common malignant tumor southern China Southeast Asia . While infection Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ) believe necessary development NPC , non-viral environmental factor also implicate increase risk NPC include consumption salt fish nitrosamine contain preserve food , formaldehyde wood dust exposure , cigarette smoking . In addition environmental factor , widely accept genetic susceptibility also play important role pathogenesis NPC . Polymorphisms gene involve nitrosamine metabolism DNA repair suggest associated NPC risk , various chromosomal region link NPC development report . These association highlight role environmental genomic component etiology NPC . There longstanding history international collaborative study elucidate role environmental genetic factor associate NPC investigator Taiwan USA . A case-control study ( 375 case ; 327 control ) conduct early 1990s , large multiplex family study complete 2006 ( 358 family ; 3,216 individual ) . Results study provide comprehensive epidemiological evidence regard factor link NPC development date . As next logical step , opportunity exists undertake genome-wide association study NPC Taiwan carefully collect environmental exposure data systematically examine environmental genetic factor associate NPC , evaluate gene-gene gene-environment interaction . The investigator propose case-control study 2000 NPC case ( retrospective [ n=800 ] prospective [ n=1,200 ] ) 2,000 age-gender-matched hospital control northern Taiwan . The study objective : 1 ) evaluate putative environmental exposure NPC ; 2 ) ass effect genetic factor , include single nucleotide polymorphism copy number variation analysis main effect gene-gene interaction ; 3 ) investigate gene-environment interaction test interaction significant genome-wide genetic variation EBV identify environmental risk factor ; 4 ) examine natural history EBV infection .</brief_summary>
