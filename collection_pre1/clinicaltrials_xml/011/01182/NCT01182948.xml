	<brief_title>Effects Different Types Exercise Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meta-analyses study evaluate effect intervention base upon structured exercise program patient type 2 diabetes show regular physical activity may improve glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 0.6-0.7 % . Most study assess effect aerobic exercise . However , recent data suggest resistance training may result similar effect . It seem likely beneficial result obtain different molecular mechanism aerobic training resistance training . Consequently , exercise modality could synergistic improve metabolic abnormality subject . On hand , comparison data limit . Aims protocol compare effect aerobic train resistance train metabolic control type 2 diabetes investigate potential pathophysiologic molecular mechanism underlie effect . The study carry 40 sedentary type 2 diabetic patient without diabetic complication , age 40-70 yr , body mass index ( BMI ) 24-36 kg/m2 HbA1c 6.5-9.0 % . Admitted diabetes treatment diet oral hypoglycemic agent . Subjects assign , randomization schedule weight baseline BMI fitness , 2 group supervise exercise : aerobic train resistance training . Training program similar volume schedule three 60 min session per week 4 month . During study subject instruct follow isocaloric diet . Before end exercise training follow assess : HbA1c ( primary outcome ) , plasma glucose , lipid profile , blood pressure , insulin sensitivity ( glucose clamp ) , body composition ( Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry , DEXA ) , liver muscle fat content ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , expression muscle gene involve ATP production , mitochondrial biogenesis substrate utilization , marker inflammation , oxidative stress early vascular damage , peak oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) maximal exercise test , exercise test , tissue oxygen extraction exercise ( Near-infrared spectroscopy , NIRS ) , energy expenditure physical activity daily life ( metabolic Holter questionnaire ) . Monitoring blood glucose also carry 48h period , comprise exercise session ( Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ) . Metabolic feature , exercise test , body composition , daily physical activity expression relevant gene muscle also assess 1 yr completion training program , establish whether change may persist time .</detailed_description>
