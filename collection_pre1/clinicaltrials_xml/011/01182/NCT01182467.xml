	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease ( CD ) gastrointestinal autoimmune disease think result exposure luminal antigen . This exposure result robust Th1 mediate immune response downregulated , result intestinal tissue injury . Crohn 's disease commonly involve distal small intestine , site difficult visualize give central location within gastrointestinal tract . A substantial proportion patient respond standard therapy . Over 40 % patient respond initial anti-TNF ( biologic ) agent approximately 10 % per year lose response drug . There standard definition constitute patient primary biologic failure . Disease activity measure index Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) . The CDAI include combination clinical criterion lab value . However , CDAI limit reliance subjective criterion , limit score 's use valid measure study response medical therapy . Clinically , reliance CDAI result inappropriate continuation ineffective therapy result worsen underlying disease , increase risk adverse reaction . Small study demonstrate PET scan may accurately quantify disease activity Crohn 's . We propose study CD patient active flare assess correlation PET activity CDAI . Additionally , determine whether PET signal intensity predictive clinical response therapy biologic agent . The study propose test hypothesis PET use determine CD patient small bowel disease true responder ( nonresponders ) biologic therapy week 12 . The use PET determine response biologic therapy small bowel Crohn 's disease would novel .</detailed_description>
