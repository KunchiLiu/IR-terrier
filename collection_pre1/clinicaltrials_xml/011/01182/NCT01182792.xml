	<brief_summary>Diseases associate chronic hypoxemia like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) emphysema , represent major medical socio-economical problem one lead cause morbidity mortality western country . Recently , show cardiovascular ( CV ) diseases contribute highly morbidity mortality patient . Furthermore , increase evidence suggest systemic vascular dysfunction play central role mediation increase CV risk patient COPD . However underlying mechanism vascular dysfunction patient incompletely understood . Chronic mountain sickness ( CMS ) characterize chronic hypoxemia relate least part hypoventilation ; affect relatively young adult , may therefore allow study effect chronic hypoxemia . The investigator therefore assess systemic vascular function test hypothesis increase oxidative stress responsible dysfunction . Since polyglobulia hallmark chronic hypoxemia suggest affect vascular function , investigator test effect hemodilution vascular function . Then , investigator test effect acute oxygen application 1 month antioxidative dietary supplement vascular function . Preliminary data suggest offspring CMS patient may display pulmonary systemic vascular dysfunction . Antioxidant administration know improve vascular function . We test acute effect Vitamin C set . Finally , since considerable inter-individual variability pulmonary artery pressure among CMS patient presence patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) increase clinical condition associate pulmonary hypertension hypoxemia , assess prevalence PFO healthy high altitude dweller CMS patient effect pulmonary artery pressure rest mild exercise .</brief_summary>
