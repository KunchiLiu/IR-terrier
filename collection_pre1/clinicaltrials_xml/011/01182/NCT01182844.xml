	<brief_title>Obesity - Inflammation - Metabolic Disease : Effect Lactobacillus Casei Shirota</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity metabolic disorder ( type 2 diabetes insulin resistance ) tightly link inflammation . Obesity , pandemic affect 30-50 % adult population , mediate variety genetic environmental factor . It well describe cytokine cause insulin resistance cause hyperinsulinemia excessive fat storage adipose tissue liver . However , trigger factor , link inflammation metabolic syndrome fully elucidate yet . Recently hypothesize gut flora important factor vicious cycle obesity , metabolic disease inflammation . Firstly , metabolic activity gut microbiota facilitates extraction calorie ingest dietary substance help store calorie host adipose tissue later use . Second , gut bacterial flora obese mouse human include few Bacteroidetes correspondingly Firmicutes lean counterpart , suggest difference caloric extraction ingest food substance may due composition gut microbiota . Furthermore , bacterial lipopolysaccharide derive intestinal microbiota may trigger inflammation , link high-fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome . High-fat diet induces insulin resistance oxidative stress mouse associate increase gut permeability . high fat diet induces low-grade endotoxemia mouse ( `` metabolic endotoxemia ) infuse endotoxin cause weight gain insulin resistance . This also show human , patient fatty liver susceptibility high gut permeability , possibly cause increase endotoxin level . Endotoxin Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein ( LBP ) elevate obese patient , patient type 2 diabetes patient liver steatosis . Endotoxin cause significant increase proinflammatory cytokine production adipocytes via TLR mediate pathway , contribution proinflammatory state obesity . Endotoxin level correlate adiponectin insulin suggest pathophysiological link obesity , inflammation metabolic disease . As described , endotoxin relate increased inflammation oxidative stress , cause insulin resistance . Adipocytes show play dynamic role regulation inflammation produce cytokine via Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) /Nuclear Factor kappa B ( NFkB ) mediate pathway.But adipocytes proinflammatory state - also circulate mononuclear cell describe activate . Clinical evidence suggest immune dysfunction obesity , since obese patient prone infection surgery , high incidence lower respiratory infection also underlined impairment cell-mediated immune response vivo vitro reduce intracellular killing neutrophil . A similar situation recently describe alcoholic cirrhosis alcoholic hepatitis , also proinflammatory condition impair innate immunity , leading infection . Endotoxin describe key mediator inadequate activation neutrophil lead high oxidative burst energy depletion cell consecutive impaired phagocytic capacity describe . The effective therapy obesity - weight loss - lead significant improvement mononuclear cell activation . However , data available effect weight loss gut flora , gut permeability endotoxin . Since weight loss usually hard achieve , therapeutic strategy test . Since gut flora seem crucial development vicious cycle obesity , inflammation metabolic disease , several study try modify composition gut microbiota . In mice treatment antibiotic improve glucose tolerance alter expression gene involve inflammation metabolism . A similar result find mice treat probiotic increase number Bifidobacterium spp. , lead improve glucose tolerance , insulin secretion decrease inflammatory tone . Finally treatment mouse probiotic decrease hepatic insulin resistance via JNK NFkB pathway , support concept intestinal bacteria induce endogenous signal play pathogenic role hepatic insulin resistance . Among vast amount bacteria describe alter gut flora exert positive effect host , choose study Lactobacillus casei Shirota several reason : Firstly commercially available preparation delivers high bacterial number relatively small volume available palatable milk drink . Furthermore Lactobacillus casei Shirota proven survive passage stomach present low intestinal tract . It also show bacterial strain increase amount Lactobacilli decrease number gram-negative organisms bacterial flora . This bacterial strain show effective modulate natural killer cell function neutrophil function . We hypothesize Lactobacillus casei Shirota able decrease metabolic endotoxemia alter gut flora composition gut permeability lead improvement neutrophil function insulin resistance obesity Specific Aims : 1 . To investigate effect Lactobacillus casei Shirota supplementation 12 week neutrophil function ( phagocytosis , oxidative burst TLR expression ) patient metabolic syndrome . 2 . To investigate effect Lactobacillus casei Shirota supplementation 12 week glucose tolerance , insulin resistance , inflammation , gut flora composition , gut permeability , endotoxemia metabolic syndrome Plan investigation : Patients : 30 Patients metabolic syndrome increase gut permeability randomize either receive food supplementation milk drink contain Lactobacillus casei Shirota ( 3 bottle day , 65 ml , contain Lactobacillus casei Shirota concentration 10E8 colony form units/ml ) twelve week standard medical therapy .</detailed_description>
