	<brief_summary>Background : - The hepatitis B vaccine show safe effective prevent transmission hepatitis B virus . Response rate initial three dos vaccine high , significant even complete immune response . However , level report decline rapidly within first year slowly thereafter . There little data durability long-term protection provide hepatitis B vaccine administer adult United States . - Vaccinated individual believe protect hepatitis B virus infection memory immune response . Even antibody level low , immune system still able produce enough antibody neutralize hepatitis B virus . Therefore , booster dos vaccine recommend , except high-risk individual patient dialysis . Researchers interested determine durability immune response hepatitis B vaccine adult low intermediate risk hepatitis B virus infection . Objectives : - To examine long-term immune status human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive negative individual receive hepatitis B vaccine adulthood , compare immune status individual acquire natural immunity recover acute hepatitis B adulthood . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age vaccinate hepatitis B least 10 year ago . - Individuals least 18 year age contract recovered acute hepatitis B least 10 year ago . - Individuals least 18 year age well-controlled HIV vaccinate hepatitis B least 10 year ago . Design : - Participants single outpatient study visit potential follow-up visit part protocol . - Participants complete questionnaire assess possible risk factor hepatitis B infection , provide blood sample test hepatitis B antibodies immune system study . - Participants receive letter phone call result blood test : - Those longer protective level antibody hepatitis B virus offer booster dose hepatitis B vaccine . To monitor immune response booster vaccine , additional study visit schedule 1 3 week follow booster . - Those chronic infection hepatitis B virus advise follow primary care physician , may eligible participate ongoing treatment trial chronic hepatitis B . - Those abnormal blood test refer back primary care physician investigation abnormal test result , may also refer National Institutes Health protocol . - Additional test evaluate immune response measles , mumps , rubella ( German measles ) virus . Some participant may advise additional MMR vaccine primary care physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B vaccine effective prevent infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Several study report long-term efficacy HBV vaccine indicate decline titer antibody hepatitis B surface antigen ( anti-HBs ) time . However , study perform person vaccinate infant child . This protocol design examine long-term immune status HIV positive negative individual vaccinate adulthood , compare immune status individual acquire natural immunity recover acute hepatitis B adulthood . Individuals lose vaccine-induced humoral immune response , offer booster vaccination immune response booster vaccination assess . In study , recruit 150 subject vaccinated secondary job-related risk acquire HBV infection . An additional 50 subject spontaneously recover acute hepatitis B ( Bullet ) 10 year ago , 50 patient well-compensated HIV infection receive HBV vaccine ( Bullet ) 10 year ago 10 subject never vaccinate never infect hepatitis B virus enrol comparison group . All subject ask complete questionnaire ass HBV exposure risk well factor may affect immune response . Immunological assay include quantitation HBV-specific antibody qualitative quantitative assessment HBV-specific memory B cell T cell indicate time interval vaccination recovery acute hepatitis B . Additional immunological assay include test antibody measles , mumps rubella ( German measles ) virus compare longevity antibody response vaccine natural infection antibody response hepatitis B vaccine natural infection . The result study help answer question whether booster vaccination require time primary vaccination course consider .</detailed_description>
