	<brief_summary>The primary objective study estimate overall survival child young adult diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treat ( DIPG ) molecularly base treatment strategy , compare historical control . Four Biopsies tumor tissue obtain surgical biopsy prior treatment stratification tolerate . An MRI-guided frameless frame-based stereotactic biopsy perform approach pontine termentum trans-cerebellar trans-frontal route . The exact biopsy location determine treat neurosurgeon designate participate site goal minimize procedural risk . Following biopsy , patient receive local radiotherapy consist 59.4Gy deliver use conventional conformal standard treatment planning adjuvant bevacizumab . Radiation plan begin pre-operative image . Based upon molecular parameter biopsy , patient potentially receive erlotinib and/or temozolomide start radiotherapy . Bevacizumab give concurrently radiotherapy begin least three week biopsy least two week start radiation therapy ensure primary wound healing occur . Once irradiation complete , patient four week interim period begin maintenance phase . Adjuvant chemotherapy continue interim period . The maintenance phase ( approxmiately 40 week ) last 10 cycle ( 28 day +/- 3 day ) . Based upon molecular parameter determine time diagnostic biopsy , patient continue receive erlotinib and/or temozolomide along bevacizumab maintenance phase . Stratification base O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) promoter methylation status epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression tumor biopsy sample . If MGMT status and/or EFGR status determinable , patient may treat per cohort # 1 ( bevacizumab irradiation ) analyze separately .</brief_summary>
