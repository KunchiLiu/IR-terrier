	<brief_summary>The purpose investigator-initiated study determine effect prior muscle activation response obtain nerve conduction study ( compound muscle action potential [ CMAP ] ) look amplitude , area , duration CMAP evaluate length time CMAP large baseline . On opposite side , correspond CMAP test periodically , muscle activation side . Null Hypothesis : While control possible technical know physiological variable , prior activation muscle effect amplitude area compound muscle action potential ( CMAP ) ; CMAP change time relaxed muscle ( opposite side ) . The investigator suspect effect prior activation muscle subsequent CMAP record muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nerve conduction study ( NCS ) perform supramaximal nerve stimulation , surface stimulation , surface recording , best possible technique control many variable possible include location record electrode warm muscle nerve ( measure temperature skin ) 3 `` arm '' study : - ulnar nerve stimulation wrist record hypothenar eminence , - median nerve stimulation wrist record thenar eminence , - peroneal nerve stimulation ankle record extensor digitorum brevis muscle . NCS perform rested muscle ( rest 15 minute longer ) multiple time 40 minute maximum isometric contraction ( activation ) test muscle define length time . The defined lengths muscle activation include : - `` brief twitch '' ( activation fraction second ) , - 2 second , - 5 second , - 10 second , - 20 second ( two epochs 10 second activation 1-2 second rest two epoch ) . The CMAP record multiple time muscle activate ( pre-activation ; well post-activation multiple time muscle activation : immediately , 5 sec , 10 sec , 15 sec , 20 sec , 30 sec , 60 sec , 90 sec , 2 minute , every minute long 40 minute ) . Similar recording make 5 duration muscle activation ( `` brief twitch , '' 2 second , 5 second , 10 second , 20 second ) three muscle ( hypothenar , thenar , EDB ) . CMAP amplitude ( baseline negative peak ) , area ( negative curve ) , duration ( negative CMAP ) measure timepoint ; skin temperature region `` active '' record electrode measure . Each data type compare time series , identified muscle record , duration muscle activation perform prior recording , time end muscle activation . On occasion test CMAP side muscle activate , record CMAP correspond muscle opposite side , second side relax entire time test ( 4-5 hour ) . If CMAP change small amount either side , F wave may test muscle rest . Each subject participate 3 `` arm . '' Testing five series recording muscle anticipate take 4-5 hour , i.e. , screen , 12-15 hour total test 3 muscle subject .</detailed_description>
