	<brief_title>Epigenetic Regulation BDNF Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) choose candidate gene development major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . BDNF report important role neuronal plasticity , axonal growth connectivity , participate local response various type neuronal stressor . BDNF also influence differentiation neuron . In past study , investigator find major depressive woman low serum BDNF protein level healthy control , BDNF level become significantly increase antidepressant treatment . In addition , author find reduced expression BDNF note postmortem brain complete suicide subject . Suicidal major depressive patient also low plasma BDNF level non-suicidal major depressive patient . These finding suggest BDNF might play important role suicidal behavior . However , past study , result fully explain major depressive patient genotypes different clinical expression , include severity depression , with/without suicide , treatment response . Recently , paper find relationship epigenetic regulation , include DNA methylation histone modification , psychopathology major depression . Therefore , try investigate relationship epigenetic regulation BDNF major depression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The clinical screening assessment patient major depression： 1 . 40 major depression recruit psychiatric inpatient accord DSMIV criterion semistructured interview . The assessment do two senior psychiatrist . The intrarater interrater reliability do project start . 2 . The patient ability complete write inform consent . 3 . The choice antidepressant drug depend need patient natural treatment procedure . They include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , eg . fluoxetine paroxetine . 4 . The 17item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD ) use assess severity depression . The minimum baseline score 17item HAMD 18 . 1 . The patient systemic disease , include metabolic , heart , liver diseases。 2 . The patient receive drug enter protocol . 3 . The patient heavy smoker dependent alcohol . 4 . The use secondary generation antipsychotic drug mood stabilizer .</criteria>
