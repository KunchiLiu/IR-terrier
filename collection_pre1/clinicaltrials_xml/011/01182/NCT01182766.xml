	<brief_title>New Treatment Alcohol Nicotine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose novel pharmacological strategy treat alcohol nicotine dependence concomitantly . The reinforce effect alcohol nicotine mediate cortico-mesolimbic dopamine ( CMDA ) system , concomitant use drug enhance pharmacological effect . We propose good approach control dopamine ( DA ) effect contemporaneous indirect modulation DA release functional expression . Both DA release cell body ventral tegmental area expression reinforce effect cortico-mesolimbic system modulate GABA efferent tonic control glutamate-mediated excitatory amino acid pathway . Thus , reasonable hypothesize medication facilitate cortico-mesolimbic GABAergic function inhibits glutamate action diminish nicotine 's alcohol 's reinforcing effect inhibit release midbrain DA functional expression pathway project nucleus accumbens cortex . The promise novel approach exemplify recent proof-of-concept demonstration topiramate compare placebo significantly improve smoking abstinence rate decrease serum cotinine level among alcohol dependent smoker . An important clinical effect topiramate alcohol-dependent individual appear anti-withdrawal effect promote gradual tapering drinking . Hence , due unique anti-withdrawal effect topiramate , propose adopt methodology treat alcohol-dependent individual , common practice smoker , set target quit date ( TQD ) relapse either drug measure . We propose 18-week , double-blind clinical trial follow-up visit 1 month 3 month , alcohol-dependent smoker receive brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment ( BBCET ) plus smoke self-help manual psychosocial treatment , randomize receive placebo , high-dose topiramate ( 250 mg/day ) , low-dose topiramate ( 125 mg/day ) prevent relapse heavy drinking smoking . Each 3 treatment arm shall contain 98 individual , total N 294 . The TQD occur begin 6th week treatment . Our primary objective determine whether low- high-dose topiramate efficacious placebo reduce percentage heavy drinking day increase continuous abstinence rate smoking determine combination self-report CO monitoring TQD last 4 week treatment . We also able determine whether low dose topiramate efficacious high dose , therefore , associate low adverse profile . Our secondary objective test whether topiramate efficacious placebo improve quality life reduce crave TQD last 4 week treatment whether improvement sustain follow-up phase .</detailed_description>
