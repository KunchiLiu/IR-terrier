	<detailed_description>Community-based program target vulnerable family consistently identify maternal depression factor negatively impact maternal child outcome . A population particular need mental health intervention mother child experience adverse pregnancy outcome , define birth child bear prematurely , low birth weight , birth defect , group increase incidence depression . Children depress mother risk vast range poor physical , cognitive , emotional problem . Children exist underlying developmental concern due adverse birth circumstance especially vulnerable . Therefore , identify at-risk mother intervene prevent onset re-occurrence depression represent opportunity help woman affect , also improve developmental behavioral outcome child . Children 3 condition impact developmental trajectory receive service federally mandate Early Intervention ( EI ) program ; thus early intervention important , underutilized , set identification intervention at-risk mother . While effective preventative psychosocial treatment depression exist , none deliver evaluate context home-based program specifically mother infant child developmental chronic health condition . The demographic early intervention family suggest mother enrol child risk depressive illness . Families poorer ( 1 4 receive welfare payment past year ) , mother less well educate , African-Americans overrepresented ( 21 % vs. 14 % general population ) , reflect know risk factor depression . Almost half infant enter early intervention first year life , target group propose intervention , low birth weight ( LBW ) significantly high level demographic risk factor normal birth weight peer . Numerous study document elevated incidence depression among mother early born infant . The young early intervention enrollee also likely identified disability condition , cerebral palsy requirement assistive technology also associate high rate maternal depressive symptom Strong problem-solving ability serve important buffer negative impact life stressor ; whereas limit problem solve skill link cause persistence psychological disorder . Problem solve approach depression prevention treatment root research demonstrate minor life event problem highly correlate psychological distress , general , depression , specifically . Problem solve intervention promote skill building demonstrate effectiveness reduce behavioral risk , include depression , number setting . Problem solve education ( PSE ) , brief skills-building psychotherapeutic intervention focus specific daily problem , applies problem structure approach find evaluate solution , one problem solve approach . Problem solve education differs problem solve intervention conduct variety health provider , specific train mental health clinician . Sessions fairly brief ( approximately 30 minute length ) positive , sustained effect achieve 6-8 session . Problem solve education 's success base premise strong problem solve ability promote sense control self-efficacy buffer negative effect life stressor . The effectiveness Problem solve education well document reduce depressive symptom increase function among patient major depression possibly minor depression dysthymia . We propose research plan involve deliver Problem solve education risk mother ( ) directly reduce symptom burden among mother depressive symptom , ( ii ) facilitate access mental health service .</detailed_description>
