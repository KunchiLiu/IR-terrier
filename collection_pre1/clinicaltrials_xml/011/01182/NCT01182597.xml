	<brief_summary>Endoscopic hemostasis document number clinical study effective decrease rebleeding , need emergency surgery , hospitalization day . Studies show adjuvant treatment proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) initial endoscopic hemostasis reduce recurrent ulcer bleeding . However , optimal dose route adjuvant PPI therapy remain controversial . A recent study demonstrate frequent oral PPI offer similar acid control currently recommend intravenous infusion PPI patient bleed ulcer . The investigator hypothesize frequent oral PPI treatment similar benefit proton pump inhibitor infusion patient bleed ulcer combine endoscopic hemostasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Versus IV Proton Pump Inhibitor High-risk Bleeding Peptic Ulcers After Endoscopic Hemostasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute peptic ulcer bleeding remain therapeutic challenge significant morbidity mortality . Endoscopic therapy use various modality significantly reduce re-bleeding , need surgery mortality patient peptic ulcer bleeding . Endoscopic therapy achieve successful hemostasis 90 % patient , re-bleeding occurs 10-30 % patient . Re-bleeding important impact prognosis . Studies show adjuvant treatment proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) initial endoscopic hemostasis reduce recurrent ulcer bleed . Two consensus document endorse high-dose PPI regimen ( 80 mg stat follow infusion 8 mg/h 72 h ) . The biologically plausible mechanism benefit high-dose regimen promote clot stability sustain intragastric pH 6 . However , optimal dose administration route proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) prevention peptic ulcer rebleeding remains unclear . The use IV PPIs add significantly cost patient care hospital . Recent study report oral PPI may similar acid suppressive effect high dose PPI infusion . A prospective trial retrospective analysis show oral PPI therapy may also effective decrease rebleeding rate patient acute gastrointestinal bleeding due high-risk peptic ulcer disease , magnitude benefit appear similar demonstrate IV PPIs . A meta-analysis report difference magnitude risk reduction oral- intravenous-route . Given significant cost saving IV counterpart , oral PPIs would attractive choice therapy situation provide similar efficacy IV PPIs . However , study directly compare oral IV PPI therapy set . We conduct head-to-head study , compare two strategy PPI administration prevention rebleeding , surgery , death patient high-risk bleeding peptic ulcer successful endoscopic hemostasis achieve .</detailed_description>
