	<brief_summary>Total abdominal hysterectomy common gynaecological operation perform worldwide . In Hong Kong , common gynaecological open procedure do number hysterectomy perform increase almost 50 % 2004 compare 1999 . In-dwelling catheter use uncomplicated abdominal hysterectomy standard method bladder treatment operation . It traditionally advocate assess urinary output prevent post-operative urinary retention patient abdominal wound unable increase intra-abdominal pressure aid voiding . However , in-dwelling catheter associate increased white cell count high rate positive urine culture , subsequently urinary tract infection lead increase morbidity , duration hospital stay , overall healthcare cost . Duration catheter use post-operatively generally base custom rather evidence-based knowledge therefore varies considerably . The current practice investigator hospital leave in-dwelling catheter in-situ 24 hour uncomplicated open gynaecological surgery . Schiotz et al show twenty-four-hour catheterization common gynaecological procedure associate low rate voiding problem catheter removal . Post-operative urinary retention lead bladder atony may increase long-term morbidity increase risk infection , detrusor instability void difficulty . In-dwelling catheter immediate post-operative period help combat problem . However , balance potential risk catheter-associated urinary tract infection vary 5 % 43 % publish trial . A prospective randomized study compare immediate versus delay catheter removal follow hysterectomy show delayed removal operation associate increased rate febrile event urinary tract infection , significantly higher subjective pain assessment . The size catheter use 16F standard 12F investigator use investigator hospital setting . It postulate small caliber in-dwelling catheter use , result increase subjective pain assessment , catheter leave in-situ 24 hour without cause increased adverse outcome possibly reduce recatheterisation rate post-operatively .</brief_summary>
