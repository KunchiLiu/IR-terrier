	<brief_title>The Value Polyp Surface Pattern Recognition Identification Neoplasia : Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Polyps common finding colonoscopy . It current practice remove lesion , potential turn cancer . However , polyp . Polyps three different type : 1 . Hyperplastic , negligible potential turn cancer leave would cause harm . These account around one third small polyp encounter 2 . Adenomas , turn cancer remove 3 . Polyp cancer , either biopsied remove completely The management pathway polyps &gt; 10mm simple either likely adenoma need removal cancer need biopsy tattoo . There rare possibility big polyp hyperplastic / serrate adenomas give risk malignant transformation , need removal well . It traditionally felt hyperplastic polyp separate clinically adenomas polyp cancer endoscopist . It reason polyp remove . However , polypectomy increase risk perforation result significant cost processing sample . Recently suggest possible differentiate neoplastic non neoplastic lesion colon use skill polyp surface pattern recognition . Kudo 's pit pattern effective way in-vivo prediction histology differentiate neoplastic non neoplasic polyp . However , originally describe use vial stain cumbersome , time consume possible perform outside Japan due lack availability fear toxicity relate gentian violet . It however produce excellent result use pit pattern recognition . ( Hurlstone DP C. S. , 2004 ) It work irreversibly bind microbial DNA directly inhibit cell replication . ( Wakelin LPG , 1981 ) . Gentian violet way examine surface pattern polyps . Many feature see white light endoscopy . ( Fu KI , 2004 ) . Furthermore , extensive experience die commonly used Western Europe . Indigo carmine dye spray perform study Japan , proven effective assesment polyp characteristic . It use 14 year colonoscopy ( Axelrad , 1996 ) . Overall diagnostic accuracy conventional view , chromoendoscopy chromoendoscopy magnification range 68 % 83 % , 82 % 92 % , 80 % 96 % , respectively . ( Axelrad AM , 1996 ) ( Tung SY , 2001 ) ( Eisen GM , 2002 ) ( Su MY , 2004 ) ( Apel D , 2006 ) . It advantage gentian violet bind tissue therefore safe . It question whether widespread application technique could influence indication biopsy sample colonoscopy indication mucosectomy ( Yasushi Sano , 2005 ) . When compare standard colonoscopy , indigo carmine chromoendoscopy , magnification , show increase accuracy polyp differentiation 84 % 96 % ( Fu KI , 2004 ) . High-resolution indigo carmine chromoendoscopy demonstrate small increase accuracy chromoendoscopy without magnification 81 % 83 % . ( Hurlstone DP K. M. , 2005 ) . Because numerous benefit lesion detection assessment polyp indigo carmine become standard part colonoscopy recognise British Society Gastroenterology important skill practice endoscopist . It become standard practice within Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust perform colonoscopy . This position reflect nationally large unit participate bowel cancer screen programme . White light endoscopy chromoendoscopy method examine colonic polyp . Computed virtual colonoscopy , video computer processor within endoscopy equipment enhances endoscopic picture become commonly available . There system available main endoscope manufacturer , include narrow band image Olympus i-scan Pentax . Fujinon develop effective post processor technology call FICE help define surface pattern polyp great detail . This standard feature endoscope produce company . It show limited number study offer potentially useful alternative dye spray predict in-vivo histology . ( J. Pohl , 2008 ) . A prospective randomise multicentre study look 764 patient FICE compare white light target indigocarmine spray . It find FICE indigocarmine able differentiate adenoma neoplasia . There sensitivity differentiate adenomas non-neoplastic polyp 92.7 % , FICE , comparable superior indigocarmine ( 90.4 % ) , statistically significant difference two technique observe . ( p=0.44 . ) FICE shorten procedure time . A prospective series look FICE evaluation colononic polyp 2cm size team suggest sensitivity 89 % could achieve . Unfortunately study look large lesion therefore difficult say whether could achieve polyp &lt; 1cm , accurate assessment clearly difficult . However , small lesion great gain term change management exists . ( Pohl J N.-T. M. , 2008 ) . It generally accept research need field . If possible endoscopists differentiate neoplastic non neoplastic polyp potential benefit term safety histopathology cost would significant . The current policy polypectomy biopsy polyp detect colonoscopy expensive option ( Â£ 80-120 ) carry significant risk perforation . Within Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust become standard practice ass polyps FICE dye spray indigo carmine prior removal . This consistent current guideline British society Gastroenterologists important detection assessment polyp . These technique establish importance colonoscopy investigation . What unclear whether endoscopists able differentiate neoplastic non-neoplastic lesion basis surface pattern recognition accurately enough able change clinical practice . We aim assess impact surface pattern assessment potential management patient , whether potential safely replace policy biopsy / polypectomy pateints polyps &lt; 10mm size .</detailed_description>
