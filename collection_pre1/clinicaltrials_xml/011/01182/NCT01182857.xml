	<brief_summary>Background : - Severe combine immunodeficiency ( SCID ) rare inherit disorder certain white blood cell impaired function unable properly fight infection . SCID typically appear within first year life characterize multiple , recurrent severe infection . More 10 percent case SCID involve deficiency enzyme call adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) , SCID patient also tend impaired brain function psychiatric disorder . Researchers attempt treat ADA-SCID patient experimental gene therapy , research protocol establish participate therapy . - Little known quality life individual ADA-SCID , researcher believe effect disease treatment may cause decreased quality life patient parent . Another potential cause decrease quality life ADA-SCID associate psychiatric neurological problem cause disease . Researchers interested study quality life individual ADA-SCID parent provide information disease . Objectives : - To evaluate whether gene therapy alters quality life neuropsychiatric status child ADA-SCID . - To monitor intellectual , attention , memory , specific learn disorder child ADA-SCID . - To evaluate whether undergo gene therapy effect parent stress parent whose child ADA-SCID . Eligibility : - Children participate ADA-SCID gene therapy research protocol ( 01-HG-0189 ) . - Parents child participate ADA-SCID gene therapy research protocol ( 01-HG-0189 ) . Design : - All test questionnaire do pediatric adult clinic . - Participating child test intelligence , manual dexterity , reaction time , basic reading arithmetic skill , speech , memory . These test give start therapy , year 5 year . - Participating child also complete questionnaire quality life . These questionnaire give start therapy , 3 month 6 month therapy , every 6 month total 5 year . - Additional psychological test may give discretion study researcher . - Parents complete questionnaire provide background medical information report quality life parental stress . The background information questionnaire give start therapy year 5 year , parental stress questionnaire give start therapy every 6 month 5 year , quality life questionnaire give time child quality life questionnaire . - This protocol separate gene therapy treatment protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study measure quality life , neuropsychological sequela parental stress gene therapy ADA-SCID . The population study include five patient treat gene therapy NIH Clinical Center five parent . The design study non-randomized , longitudinal psychometric evaluation .
