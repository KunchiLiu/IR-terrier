	<brief_summary>Background : - Patients advanced thyroid cancer low long-term survival rate . These type thyroid cancer respond well conventional surgery radiation , specific thyroid cancer treatment radioactive iodine treatment thyroid hormone thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) suppression . - Valproic acid long approve anticonvulsant treat seizure patient epilepsy . It also use treat bipolar disorder . Recent study show valproic acid promise effect thyroid cancer treatment may help destroy cancer cell help conventional treatment effective . However , valproic acid approve thyroid cancer therefore investigational drug . Objectives : - To determine whether valproic acid inhibit tumor growth induce tumor cell death . - To determine whether valproic acid make tumor cell increase uptake radioiodine . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advanced-stage thyroid cancer either unresponsive conventional treatment fail absorb radioiodine . Design : - Eligible participant continue standard thyroid hormone suppression therapy begin receive valproic acid total 10 week . Participants keep study diary record dose side effect , regular clinic visit provide blood sample receive additional valproic acid . - After 10 week , participant Thyrogen scan measure radioiodine uptake valproic acid therapy . Tumor biopsy blood sample take time . - If increase radioiodine uptake scan , participant additional radioiodine therapy . - If increase uptake scan , participant continue valproic acid 7 week . After 16 total week treatment , additional blood sample scan take . Participants may continue take valproic acid thyroid cancer appear respond treatment . - Follow-up visit schedule 3 , 6 , 9 ( patient continue valproic acid ) , 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Valproic Acid Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancers Follicular Cell Origin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients advance differentiated thyroid cancer ( Stage IV ) five-year survival 25 % . Clinically result aggressive growth , metastasis , decreased loss iodine uptake tumor , tumor may refractory conventional treatment : surgical resection , radioactive iodine treatment thyroid hormone Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) suppression . In thyroid cancer , valproic acid , clinically achievable concentration , antiproliferative differentiating effect . We hypothesize valproic acid may inhibit proliferation induce differentiation thyroid cancer cell 131-I may detect residual disease effective radioiodine ablation thyroid cancer cell follicular cell origin . Objectives : The primary goal study determine valproic acid antineoplastic differentiation effect patient advance metastatic thyroid cancer follicular cell origin . Eligibility : Unresectable advanced and/or poorly differentiate thyroid cancer follicular cell origin ( exclude anaplastic medullary thyroid cancer ) uptake ( le 1 % ) radioiodine scan unresponsive radioiodine therapy . Elevated serum thyroglobulin ( Tg ) level ( great 100ng/ml thyroid hormone ; great 10ng/ml thyroid hormone ) . Design : This open label phase II study ass efficacy valproic acid therapy antiproliferative differentiation agent patient incurable differentiated thyroid cancer ( unresponsive and/or radioiodine negative unresectable ) . Oral valproic acid administer reach therapeutic serum level ( 50 100 microgram/ml ) . The number patient enrol 25 interim analysis response 13 patient evaluable response . It anticipate five patient may enrol per year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Advanced/poorly differentiate thyroid cancer follicular cell origin uptake ( less 1 % ) radioiodine scan unresponsive radioiodine therapy . Unresponsiveness radioiodine therapy define patient thyroglobulin fall less 2ng/ml within 6 month previous radioiodine ablative treatment . 2 . Extensive ( invasive ) locoregional tumor mass and/or metastatic spread , render patient inoperable . 3 . Thyroglobulin ( Tg ) level great equal 100 ng/ml absence Tg antibody . Patients Tgantibody ( TgAb ) positive may include despite low Tg level detectable disease cross sectional imaging . ( The presence TgAb may lead falsely low Tg level therefore render Tg less sensitive marker disease . However , TgAb show also act tumor marker , use endpoint study patient TgAb positive. ) . 4 . Within 18 month enrollment , patient must radioactive iodine ( RAI ) scan , show therapeutically insignificant RAI uptake ( less equal 1 % ) . 5 . Initial therapy must include total/neartotal thyroidectomy RAI ablation therapy . 6 . Patients must chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapy malignancy month prior treatment must recover side effect therapeutic diagnostic intervention . 7 . Greater equal 18 year age . 8 . Must able understand sign Informed Consent Document . 9 . Clinical performance status Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group ( ECOG ) less equal 1 . 10 . Life expectancy great three month . 11 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) within 72 hour prior study entry must willing practice effective birth control prevent pregnancy receive treatment three month treatment discontinue . All male child father potential must also willing practice effective birth control . 12 . Laboratory result must within follow parameter entry : Absolute Neutrophil Count great 750 cells/mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin great 8.0 gm/dl Platelet count great 75000/mm ( 3 ) Creatinine less tha 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total protein great 6.4 . Total bilirubin le 1.5 time ULN . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) serum glutamic oxaloacetic ( SGOT ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) less 1.5 time ULN . Amylase less 1.5 time ULN Ammonia less 1.5 time ULN EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Allergy valproic acid . 2 . Current coexist malignancy basal cell carcinoma . 3 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeeding . Valproic acid know teratogen , cause primary neural tube defect , facial abnormality , skeletal malformation ; therefore pregnant woman exclude . Additionally , patient become pregnant study protocol discontinue immediately . 4 . Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder major medical illness . 5 . Patients take tolbutamide , warfarin , zidovudine , benzodiazepine , clonazepam , diazepam . 6 . Seizure disorder .</criteria>
