	<brief_summary>The purpose study improve efficacy HDC regimen add novel , `` target '' mean administer variation total body irradiation ( TBI ) radiation i.e. , total skeletal irradiation ( TSI ) administer helical tomotherapy ( HT ) , addition current standard HDC , dose 200 mg/m2 ( HDMel200 ) . The underlying postulate endeavor TSI-HT provide additional cytoreduction HDMel alone , without produce additional ( serious ) toxicity . We utilize classical Phase I study design ( i.e. , dose escalation ) myeloma patient undergo AHSCT2 define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . Finally , although comparison therapy typical ( and/or feasible ) Phase I study , compare , whenever possible , toxicity antimyeloma activity AHSCT2 AHSCT1 . This protocol standardize , much possible use AHSCT2 `` tandem '' `` salvage '' procedure . Since sufficient AHSC ( CD34+ cell ) routinely collect adequate number multiple AHSCTs , recently use infrequently , important work towards define optimal utilization resource .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While HDC/AHSCT active patient eventually relapse ; obviously , less response progress well . Many investigator regard HDC/AHSCT `` mature '' modality useful fix element evolve treatment paradigm focus introduction new ( non-HDC/AHSCT ) agent unique mechanisms action . However , data several related source ( include syngeneic second [ `` tandem '' salvage ] AHSCT experience ) , suggest efficacy HDC/AHSCT could improve obtain good cytoreduction HDC component , thus prolong survival possibly even produce increase cure . However , require additional attention source relapse follow HDC/AHSCT , mainly residual myeloma patient , perhaps also inadvertent reinfusion clonogenic myeloma cell AHSCT . For reason discuss herein , study focus former . We believe agent potent activity vs. ( multiple ) myeloma cancer stem cell ( MM-CSC ) and/or microenvironment ultimately need increase cure rate myeloma . Unfortunately , preliminary data suggest current modality use myeloma therapy variably effective vs. target , new agent activity become available clinical trial . The use newer agent likely augment , supplant , current modality , lend even urgency optimize exist element try improve efficacy HDC/AHSCT especially determine activity vs. MM-CSC and/or microenvironment current modality augment . Radiation seem especially attractive re-evaluate , give new , `` target '' method administration describe herein . Impetus effort come know radiosensitivity clonogenic myeloma cell ( population least may contain MM-CSC ) , especially give ability local radiotherapy provide local disease control myeloma , especially give ability local radiotherapy cure patient solitary plasmacytoma `` prove '' activity radiotherapy vs. MM-CSC closely-related diagnosis . It important note improvement current modality may offer good clinical outcome even major effect vs. MM-CSC microenvironment interaction produce . We currently ability measure effect ; part trial .</detailed_description>
