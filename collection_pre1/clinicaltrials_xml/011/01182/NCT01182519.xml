	<brief_summary>The purpose study find link cigarette smoking , inflammation spread breast cancer lung . We think woman current former smoker may increase risk breast cancer spread lung compare woman never smoke . Smoking cause inflammation lung woman . Researchers Memorial Sloan-Kettering ( MSKCC ) think smoking-related lung inflammation may increase chance breast cancer spread lung . In order find whether inflammation play role breast cancer spread lung , measure urinary marker lung inflammation . This allow u determine marker commonly elevate woman breast cancer spread lung compare without breast cancer lung . We also collect DNA blood opportunity determine difference DNA woman without breast cancer spread sit include lung . We also collect blood determine identify risk factor spread breast cancer lung .</brief_summary>
