	<brief_title>Dutasteride Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To evaluate change volume foci prostate cancer assess T2-weighted MRI , follow exposure dutasteride ( Avodart ) 0.5 mg daily six month . Secondary - To determine change volume prostate cancer determine gadolinium-enhanced MRI diffusion-weighted MRI 6 month dutasteride 0.5 mg compare placebo . - To determine change volume prostate cancer determine T2-weighted MRI , gadolinium-enhanced MRI , diffusion-weighted MRI 3 month dutasteride compare placebo . - To determine change MR characteristic prostate cancer ( perfusion , cell density ) baseline six month patient dutasteride compare placebo . - To determine change volume prostate cancer assess HistoScan transrectal ultrasound baseline six month , patient dutasteride compare placebo . - To determine association measure prostate cancer volume MRI measure prostate cancer volume HistoScan baseline six month patient dutasteride compare placebo . - To determine association measure change prostate cancer volume use MRI , measure change prostate cancer volume use HistoScan transrectal ultrasound , baseline six month , patient dutasteride compare placebo . - To correlate change tumor volume characteristic see MRI change see HistoScan baseline six month patient dutasteride compare placebo . - To correlate change tumor volume characteristic see MRI histological feature see 6-month biopsy ( Gleason score sum , number core involve , cancer core length ) patient dutasteride compare placebo . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral dutasteride daily 6 month . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily 6 month . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo multi-sequence MRI baseline , 3 month , 6 month HistoScan transrectal ultrasound baseline 6 month . Patients may also undergo targeted biopsy prostate ( standard transrectal biopsy plus ultrasound-guided targeting lesion see MRI ) 6 month .</detailed_description>
