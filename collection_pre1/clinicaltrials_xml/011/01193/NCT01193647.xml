	<brief_title>Genetic Factors Affecting Risks Rotator Cuff Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . We recruit study patient PI undergo MRI shoulder complaint . The PI shoulder elbow surgeon treat variety shoulder non-shoulder pathology . All patient agree participate undergo history , physical examination shoulder , record demographic , family history , genealogy , risk factor . All participant provide blood saliva sample . Serum DNA store University Utah future analysis . Based upon result MRI , patient categorize base presence absence rotator cuff tear . We hope extend hospital-wide ascertainment eventually . All patient ask known case shoulder disorder family member . Patients option share live family member name contact information research team , contact invite study . Aim 2 . From DNA bio-repository , begin describe familial nature rotator cuff disease characteristic relate increased risk . We also begin ascertainment sample high-risk individual pedigree , perform association study identify risk-associated variant , screen candidate gene fund available . Aim 3 : Utilizing Utah Population Database ( UPDB ) , also define high risk pedigree within cohort individual rotator cuff tear . We also use database identify high risk pedigree examine information family member patient tear identify high risk pedigree well . The RGE already approve use UPDB purpose . Aim 4 : Use UUHSC medical record link UPDB define heritable nature rotator cuff injury tendonopathies . Aim 5 : Determine ABO frequencies patient rotator cuff tear compare population normal utilize UPDB . Aim 6 : Use UUHSC medical record link UPDB define heritable nature rotator cuff injury compression neuropathy . Aim 7 : Query UUHSC EDW rotator cuff repair code obtain ABO blood type patient . We also obtain operative room report , name MRN number patient ensure n't duplication already enrol patient UUHSC EDW finding .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Includes patient shoulder MRI perform evaluate shoulder pain part standard clinical exam . All first degree relative patient document rotator cuff tear also possible study participant . All patient Drs . Tashjian , Burks Greis undergone surgical rotator cuff repair . Exclude patient undergone prior shoulder surgery besides surgery perform PI accurate information , include MRI data exist , regard presence absence rotator cuff tear surgery . Any patient pregnant .</criteria>
