	<detailed_description>The major cause death , next early organ failure , secondary infection pancreatic peripancreatic necrotic tissue , lead sepsis multiple organ failure . The diagnosis treatment infected necrosis SAP remain major challenge clinician . The necrotic infection define microorganism isolated sample ultrasound compute tomography ( CT ) guide fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) . Unfortunately , negative biopsy result completely rule infection repeat aspiration may lead bleed iatrogenic infection . Moreover , whatever microbiologic diagnostic procedure choose , laboratory processing delay 24 48 hour require definitive quantitative microbial culture result . Meanwhile , clinician often feel uncomfortable diagnosis may administer unneeded antibiotic await laboratory result . Secondary infection necrotic tissue SAP patient virtually always indication intervention . The traditional approach open necrosectomy completely remove infected necrotic tissue . This invasive approach associate high rate complication ( 34 95 % ) death ( 11 39 % ) .As alternative open necrosectomy , less invasive technique , include percutaneous drainage endoscopic ( transgastric ) drainage , increasingly used.These step may postpone even obviate surgical necrosectomy reduce complication death.It remain uncertain intervention optimal term clinical condition patient severity local infection . Therefore , many biologic marker study effort improve diagnostic rate determine severity necrosis infection disappointing result . The trigger receptor express myeloid cell ( TREM-1 ) member immunoglobulin superfamily whose expression phagocytes up-regulated exposure bacteria fungi . TREM-1 mediates acute inflammatory response microbial product . [ 27 ] TREM-1 also shed membrane activate phagocyte find soluble form body fluid . We evaluate whether lever soluble TREM-1 ( sTREM-1 ) FNA fluid patient suspected infection good marker secondary infection necrotic tissue indicator proper treatment drainage necrosectomy .</detailed_description>
