	<brief_summary>The PARADYM RF ICDs ( DR , VR CRT ) implement 3 innovative feature : The new RV autothreshold algorithm help physician diagnosis avoid potential lose capture . Then , ICD device also capability remotely interrogated remote monitor system whose performance report study . Finally study report electrical handle performance new leave ventricular lead .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Of The PARADYM RF Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In PARADYM RF clinical study , sponsor aim : - Demonstrating performance right ventricular autothreshold algorithm ; - Reporting adverse event document study ; - Reporting electrical performance Sorin Group PARADYM ICDs , order validate performance device conformance longevity effectiveness objective ; - Assessing user satisfaction ( patient physician ) remote monitor solution overall availability system term data . - Reporting Situs 2 MV leave ventricular lead performance ; - Reporting Situs 2 MV LV lead mechanical handling . Thus , study intend show PARADYM RF ICDs operate safely appropriately intended-use part ICD system .</detailed_description>
