	<brief_summary>Primary outcome measure : Evaluate efficacy term complete response induction therapy first-line consolidation Clofarabine low-dose Cytarabine AML patient age 60 year . The first efficacy objective evaluate overall remission rate ( TRG ) , general reference ( RG ) define patient achieve complete remission ( CR ) complete remission inadequate platelet recovery ( CPR ) . Secondary outcome measure : - To evaluate disease-free survival ( DFS ) - Evaluate overall survival ( OS ) - To evaluate safety tolerability clofarabine duration , severity relationship adverse event ( AEs ) occur treatment - To assess rate mortality 30 day ( ie , incidence death occur Day 1 Day 30 induction cycle ) - The incidence , intensity ( accord late version CTCAE classification ) , duration , causality , severity type AA</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Low-dose Cytarabine Followed Consolidation Therapy AML Patients Age Greater Than Equal 60 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol correspond multicenter , phase II , open , non randomize , design determine efficacy clofarabine low-dose cytarabine combination AML patient older equal 60 year . The trial divide pre-treatment treatment ( cycle / induction consolidation ) periods.The induction cycle consist clofarabine 20 mg/m2/day intravenously 5 consecutive day plus cytarabine subcutaneously 20 mg/m2/day 14 consecutive day . If patient achieve CR receive second course induction pattern . Consolidation cycle consist clofarabine intravenously 15 mg/m2/day 5 consecutive day plus cytarabine 20 mg/m2/day subcutaneously 7 consecutive day . Patients receive maximum 12 cycle clofarabine LDAC . The monitoring phase survival make clinical practice continue patient either die survive two year end treatment visit . There 75 patient old equal 60 year . Patients evaluate follow period : Pre-treatment treatment ( induction consolidation ) . Pre-treatment phase : include enrolment visit patient complete write informed consent participate study . There selection patient give write informed consent join clinical trial . They must meet inclusion criterion exclusion . Treatment phase : Patients begin treatment within 14 day sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . Selection period begin ICF sign inclusion period begin patient first receives study drug ( ie Day 1 induction cycle ) . Safety evaluate monitoring adverse event haematological haematological relate drug 's study . The final visit treatment take place least 45 day last dose study drug administration . Patients leave study prematurely , end treatment visit within 2 week decision continue administer study drug . The final visit take place within 2 week visit last cycle treatment . Off protocol , make final visit , patient receive least one dose study drug subject monitoring normal clinical practice , minimum two year final visit death Follow phase : The maximum follow-up patient 2 year final visit last patient include conduct monthly basis first year quarterly second least , notwithstanding may visit discretion centre depend clinical feature .</detailed_description>
