	<brief_summary>1 . To compare EGFR mutation primary non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumours correspond CTCs isolate label-free microfluidic device-based system 2 . To characterize association clinical response NSCLC patient treat gefitinib serial change CTC EGFR mutation detect label-free microfluidic device-based system The investigator recently develop label-free , microfluidic device capture circulate tumour cell ( CTCs ) acquire Fluidigm Biomark digital PCR instrument reliable low-level DNA quantification . The overall aim study test feasibility use state-of-the-art device reliably detect clinically relevant EGFR mutation CTCs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Circulating Tumour Cell Molecular Diagnostics Using Novel Microfluidic Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For Aim 1 , two 5ml pre-treatment blood correspond tumor sample obtain NSCLC patient National University Health System . Sampling organize avoid blood sample first sample take skin puncture minimize contamination skin epithelial cell . For first blood sample , CTCs isolate retrieve use NUS develop CTC bio-chip accord method describe previously.21 From second blood sample , CTCs isolate , fix chip stain EpCAM , CD45 DAPI ass cell purity quantity . DNA extract retrieved CTCs tumour sample , analyze exon 19 deletion , L858R T790M mutation digital PCR Fluidigm Biomark accord method describe previously.23 EGFR mutation status blood tumour sample compare concordance . For Aim 2 , patient NSCLC treat gefitnib approach . Two 5ml blood sample obtain pre-treatment ( baseline ) every 4 week treatment ( one cycle gefitinib ) NSCLC patient National University Health System . CTCs also obtain analysed patient another protocol receive gefitinib/ hydroxychloroquine . ( B/08/196 . A phase II lead phase I study examine tolerability , safety profile efficacy Hydroxychloroquine Gefitinib advance Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer . ) In study , CTCs already collect . Hence investigator intend use sample B/08/196 CTC analysis use CTC biochip platform . For timepoint , CTCs isolate , retrieve analyzed EGFR mutation status describe . Clinical response determine use RECIST criteria.34 Associations pre-treatment EGFR mutation type quantity best clinical response assess Fisher 's exact test . Association trend EGFR mutation type quantity tumour size treatment cycle assess observation perform study Maheswaran et al.9 The investigator plan analyze 30 patient one year aim study . Some case relevant sample ( serial blood sample correspond tumour ) aim . The sample size base study Maheshwaran et al.9 also likely volume suitable subject 1 year NUHS . Relevant data sample size estimation otherwise lack . In particular , frequency T790M mutation relevant patient population lacking , highlight lack adequate analytical system assessment one propose study .</detailed_description>
