	<brief_summary>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ( SBP ) , infection ascitic fluid absence localize intra-abdominal infection , one main potentially fatal complication cirrhosis . In case SBP , early diagnosis rapid therapeutic care improve patient survival ( Garcia-Tsao , 2001 ) . The diagnosis SBP base detection polymorphonuclear neutrophil count equal great 250 /mm3 ascitic fluid ( method reference ) . However , obtain ascitic cell count sometimes difficult always perform emergency especially outside opening hour laboratory Bacteriology . This raise necessity develop quick easy alternative approach diagnosis . Few group propose use urinary reagent strip rapid diagnosis SBP . Nevertheless , investigator clinical team show sensitivity test low large national multicenter prospective study involve thousand patient ( Nousbaum et al. , 2007 ) . The use Multistix strip test thus recommend routine application diagnosis SBP due lack sensitivity . Although perform small group patient , several study report IL-8 IL-6 might use marker ascitic fluid infection . Based data confirm investigator preliminary result investigator propose study broad recruitment patient estimate 500 inclusion ( 45 infect patient ) interest use IL-8 IL-6 predictive marker SBP . The investigator propose use ELISA method , standardize , rapid automate , applicable context emergency ( 7 day week 24 hour day ) previously describe work conduct exclude urinary tract infection ( Oregioni et al. , 2005 ) . During preliminary experiment conduct project , investigator also find systematic variation another marker , leptin . This protein hormone involve inflammatory immune response ( Otero et al. , 2005 ) . It appear necessary include study marker analysis differential protein response patient suffer suffer SBP . The investigator therefore propose diagnostic study , non-interventional , prospective , multicenter trial conduct 2 year . - The main objective establish diagnostic performance ( sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative ) IL-8 IL-6 , assay ascites fluid automate ELISA early diagnosis SBP . - The secondary objective confirm interest measurement leptin SBP establish diagnostic performance IL-8 IL-6 leptin accord different clinical feature patient ( score Child-Pugh classification history SBP , ascitic fluid infection positive bacterial culture ) .</brief_summary>
