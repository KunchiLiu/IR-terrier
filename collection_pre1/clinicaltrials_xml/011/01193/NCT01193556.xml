	<brief_title>PEAK PlasmaBlade TnA Versus Traditional Electrosurgery Subcapsular Tonsillectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tonsillectomy perform response case repeat occurrence acute tonsillitis adenoiditis , obstructive sleep apnea , nasal airway obstruction , snore , peritonsillar abscess . The PEAK PlasmaBlade use pulse radiofrequency ( RF ) energy highly-insulated handpiece design enable precision cut coagulation point application . The PlasmaBlade receive FDA clearance use plastic , general , orthopedic , ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) surgery , demonstrate significantly reduce thermal injury profile incise tissue compare traditional electrosurgical device . It hypothesize benefit may improve post-operative outcome patient undergo tonsillectomy . Two study site grant approval prospective randomize study . Potential subject screen inclusion exclusion criterion study protocol require provide inform consent ( adult ) child prior enrollment . Following enrollment , subject prospectively randomize SOC PlasmaBlade ( PB PEAK ) study group schedule tonsillectomy tonsillectomy adenoidectomy ( TnA ) .</detailed_description>
