	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate dietary protein requirement elderly woman age 80 year old use indicator amino acid oxidation technique . Hypothesis test : Protein requirement elderly woman higher estimated average requirement 0.66 g∙kg-1∙d-1 protein . The recommended protein intake elderly woman higher recommend dietary allowance 0.80 g∙kg-1∙d-1 protein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There currently considerable debate regard accuracy estimate average requirement ( EAR ) recommend dietary allowance ( RDA ) old people . Very limited data obtain old individual available support assumption age affect protein requirement . Existing method like nitrogen balance inherent limitation diminish consider reference method . Indicator amino acid oxidation technique emerge alternative method measure dietary protein requirement . It accurate less demand . The current study first time technique use elderly adult provide important foundation geriatric nutrition research .</detailed_description>
