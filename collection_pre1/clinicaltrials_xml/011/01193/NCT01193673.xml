	<brief_title>Discovering Gene ( ) Causing Developmental Dysplasia Hip ( DDH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Developmental dysplasia hip ( DDH ) , formerly know Congenital Dislocation Hip ( CDH ) relatively common disorder lead early onset arthritis hip . It believe DDH major cause arthritis hip young patient . The majority patient DDH unaware condition . Only small number patient extremely severe form disease ( dislocated hip ) identify birth . The remain patient usually seek help severe arthritis present joint preservation treatment possible . The exact etiology condition remain elusive . Based report literature , DDH believe genetic basis . Dr. Javad Parvizi Rothman Institute ( RT ) Philadelphia extensive experience condition center provide joint preservation procedure pelvic femoral osteotomy . They also extensive experience hip replacement patient . They aware family many affected individual . Close history take examination patient suggest may indeed genetic basis DDH . Based finding far , believe dominant pattern inheritance may exist , imply disorder may inherit Mendelian manner ( Single gene disorder ) . Furthermore , Dr. Parvizi 's group document peculiar pattern dominant inheritance affect male give rise affect female child , suggest disorder may inherit X-linked dominant trait . X-linked dominant mode inheritance gene X chromosome dominant . The X-linked dominant inheritance may part account large number female affect trait . Understanding inheritance mechanism disease allow well genetic counseling monitoring affected individual family . The reason behind study investigate possible genetic inheritance disease . Knowing information allow u test patient disease early arthritis develop . In addition possible good treatment may design base knowledge . DDH relatively common condition . Although severe form DDH usually diagnose birth ( dislocated hip ) , majority ( &gt; 80 % ) patient condition even know suffer disease usually discover condition disable arthritis hip develop early adulthood .</detailed_description>
