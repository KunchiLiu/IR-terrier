	<detailed_description>In first place Apgar-score help evaluate postnatal adaptation newborn use index resuscitative intervention . However , show past score limit may influence several factor variability examiner , drug , parental age , neurological impairment child well premature delivery . Previous study proven , however , evaluation infant 's condition conventional Apgar-score affect due non-uniform definition . For , explanation might one hand inaccuracy score base miss guideline assessment score premature infant . Both , muscle tone reflexes extremely premature infant physiologically immature term newborn . In conclusion , healthy premature infant often achieve low Apgar-score term counterpart . However , rather expression immaturity sign postnatal depression . Another reason inaccuracy score might origin limited comparability validity Apgar-score apply resuscitate newborn . Until consensus assess condition newborn resuscitation , since individual characteristic compose score affected resuscitation . For example , heart frequency skin colour improve sufficient ventilation . So far regulation fact consider assess score . A description infant 's condition without intervention respectively interruption intervention apply would contrast Apgar 's intention score `` could determine easily without interfere care infant '' . The description condition independently intervention apply offer practicable alternative . By use method resuscitation interrupt score express effort infant describe condition , independently requirement need achieve condition . To validate accuracy specify version Apgar-score predict neonatal mortality long term outcome preterm infant , multicenter TEST-Apgar study perform recently . The American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) also aware problem concern description resuscitate newborns . As solution , suggest use expand Apgar-score report form account concurrent resuscitative intervention ( AAP-Score ) . This way infant 's condition estimate document easily . Although AAP-Score suggest 4 year ago , data predictive reliability available yet . This aspect regard neonatal mortality premature infant also analyze TEST-Apgar study . The result show specified Apgar-Score use combination AAP-Score future appraise condition premature infant . Its predictive value regard neonatal mortality premature infant good . Detailed result publish soon . The present study analyze validity specify Apgar- AAP- Scores asphyxiate infant &gt; 37 week gestation undergo resuscitation . Since Apgar-score present index postnatal adaption extra-uterine life , reflect efficiency resuscitative intervention also serve inclusion criterion specific type therapy ( e.g . hypothermia therapy ) , necessary , standardise use Apgar-score improve prognostic value .</detailed_description>
