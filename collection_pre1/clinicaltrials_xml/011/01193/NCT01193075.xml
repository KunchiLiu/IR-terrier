	<brief_title>Natural History Evaluation Charcot Marie Tooth Disease ( CMT ) Types CMT1B , CMT2A , CMT4A , CMT4C , Others</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Inherited Neuropathies Consortium ( INC ) member Rare Disease Clinical Research Network ( RDCRN ) fund National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Office Rare Diseases ( ORD ) NINDS . The University Iowa lead center INC also include site University Pennsylvania , Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) , University Rochester ( NY ) , National Hospital Neurology Neurosurgery London England , Dubowicz Neuromuscular Center , University Miami ( Florida ) . The North American CMT Network additional consortium fund Muscular Dystrophy Association ( MDA ) Charcot Marie Tooth Association ( CMTA ) . The University Iowa lead site consortium well . Additional sit include University Washington ( Seattle ) , Vanderbilt University , Johns Hopkins University , University Sydney , Besta Neurological Institute Milan ( Italy ) , Harvard University intramural Neurogenetics division NIH . All funding source agree allow u house data two consortium together NIH fund Data Management Coordinating Center ( DMCC ) University South Florida group name Inherited Neuropathies Consortium ( INC ) . The inherited peripheral neuropathy often call Charcot Marie Tooth Disease ( CMT ) , name three physician scientist first describe . These heterogenous group disorder cause mutation 50 different gene . The disease cause weakness loss sensation patient . There effective treatment form CMT . There also limited information natural history different type CMT progress limit outcome measure measure impairment . The purpose INC investigate natural history different type CMT , identify gene modify severity individual type CMT , develop test outcome measure child CMT , develop interactive website patient CMT develop knowledge need perform clinical trial patient CMT . To , people , suspect , family history inherit neuropathy take part full-day evaluation . These patient see order receive possible diagnosis CMT clinical care , may also choose participate research project . Most testing perform would do part standard care diagnose treat patient inherit neuropathy . Additional testing may perform certain subject applicable , majority subject volunteer study allow u use clinical information obtain visit cod data natural history purpose develop outcome measure . Because individual attend CMT clinic would eligible participation study , arrive clinic visit , initial meeting review consent form research project . Thus , evaluation begin consent subject study , applicable . Then , variety test take place measure presence severity symptom , along identify type CMT patient/subject may . Tests include study also standard care patient inherited neuropathy include neurological evaluation train neurologist , limited set nerve conduction study , physical therapy assessment , orthotist assessment , genetic counseling , possibly genetic test determine form CMT . Additional clinical testing may use research include EMGs MUNE test evaluate possible muscular dystrophy muscle involvement disease . The result test use diagnostic purpose give patient CMT Neuropathy Score ( CMTNS ) validate instrument allow u assess severity disease base 36 point scale . If subject also involved research project , result also use research purpose . Additionally , subject may undergo test part regular clinical care , do research purpose . These tests/procedures may include hand function testing , physical assessment use CMT Peds Score ( instrument use evaluate child CMT - see substudy 6603 ) , research base genetic testing , quality life questionnaire , skin biopsy . All tests/procedures optional , subject complete involve overall natural history study . Opting procedure mean would exclude study . Some procedure would perform certain individual eligible base age type CMT . Skin biopsy perform certain qualified subject research purpose order grow fibroblast cell study various form CMT . These individual would 18 specific form CMT . Additionally , sub-studies perform SOME subject may eligible . These sub-study option discuss patient prior participation . Sub-study # 6601 - Test-retest protocol addendum pCMT-QOL . Substudy small group subject order assess test-retest reliability indicate reproducibility pCMT-QOL . In order calculate test-retest reliability , single site Inherited Neuropathy Consortium ( University Iowa ) , 25 subject age 8-18 parent give appropriate version pCMT-QOL , well parent 10 subject age 7 . These parent addition give pre-stamped envelope contain version pCMT-QOL take , complete child and/or parent 4 week return mail ( CMT , disease fluctuate 4 week interval ) . Parents give one reminder phone call 6-8 week , pCMT-QOL form mail report miss . Test-retest reliability estimate intraclass correlation coefficient ( two-way random effect model ) show correlation give individual 's score two QOL assessment take 4 week apart . Sub-study # 6602 - This project understand modifier gene influence severity disease expression , along identify new form CMT genetically determine . Subjects eligible either CMT type 1A ( CMT1A ) unknown form CMT type 2 ( CMT2 ) . Blood drawn send University Miami receive cod sample process exome sequencing . Subjects tell optional . Sub-study # 6603 - This project develop new CMT Pediatric Scale ( CMT Peds ) Children CMT . Although validate score ( CMTNS ) measure disease severity CMT , always applicable child due limited ability relay information symptom . The CMT Peds scale develop validate order measure disease severity child outcome measure available future clinical trial . Children ( define 21 ) evaluate ask perform functional task use stair , walk hallway , perform hand function test . This information use validate CMT Peds score . Subjects inform study optional . These test perform one day clinic visit . Patients attend clinic give option return annual visit help disease management . If patient decides follow clinic , ask participate research . They need participate research order see clinic , opt time . If subject follow make appointment clinic , contact u schedule return visit . All return visit initiate patient/subject . An individual decide participate research , still able see clinic receive medical recommendation , treatment , care clinical team specialize inherited neuropathy .</detailed_description>
