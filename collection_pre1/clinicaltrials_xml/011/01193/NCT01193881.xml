	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) toxicity RO4929097 combine erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( Dose escalation portion ) II . To assess whether probability detectable tumor shrinkage response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria correlate pre-therapy immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) reverse phase protein array ( RPPA ) expression Notch 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . ( Dose escalation portion ) III . A preliminary , exploratory assessment perform respect percent tumor shrinkage probability response first 2 cycle therapy . ( Expansion cohort ) IV . A preliminary , exploratory assessment perform respect change tumor immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) score reverse phase protein array ( RPPA ) expression Notch 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 first 2 cycle erlotinib . ( Expansion cohort ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform preliminary exploratory assessment whether probability detectable tumor shrinkage/response correlate pre RO4929097 presence tumor activate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation , T790M EGFR mutation , meet proto-oncogene ( c-MET ) gene amplification insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) expression activation various Notch pathway marker . ( Dose escalation portion ) II . To perform preliminary exploratory assessment whether addition RO4929097 erlotinib lead tumor shrinkage/response tumor deposit previously exhibit growth erlotinib alone . ( Dose escalation portion ) III . Conduct preliminary exploratory assessment expansion cohort respect tumor shrinkage/response follow first 2 cycle erlotinib RO4929097 treatment without presence mutation , amplification , activation marker : tumor IHC score RPPA expression Notch ligand jag 1 ( Jag1 ) , Notch target hairy enhancer split 1 ( HES1 ) , hairy/enhancer-of-split related YRPW motif protein 1 ( HEY1 ) ; tumor IHC score RPPA expression putative stem cell marker cluster differentiation ( CD ) 24 ( decreased stem cell ) , CD44 , CD133 , dehydrogenase epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) markers E-cadherin vimentin ; detectability tumor EGFR T790M mutation , MET amplification , IGF-1R expression activation ; soluble marker angiogenesis , include stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha ( SDF-1alpha ) , basic fibroblastic growth factor ( bFGF ) , cryptic epitope collagen IV , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . ( Expansion cohort ) IV . Conduct preliminary exploratory assessment whether percent tumor shrinkage/response time progression correlate pre-therapy IHC RPPA expression Notch 1 , 2 , 3 4 , Notch pathway stem cell marker , baseline detectability T790M mutation MET amplification , baseline IGF-1R expression activation , change marker initial biopsy subsequent biopsy . ( Expansion cohort ) V. In tumor sample collect dose escalation phase expansion cohort , assess IHC RPPA expression Notch , Notch ligand Notch target correlate expression stem cell marker . VI . Assess percent tumor shrinkage/response , time progression baseline change IHC RPPA expression Notch , Notch ligand , Notch target stem cell marker varies : tumor Notch gene amplification assess fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) ; tumor IHC RPPA expression select member Wnt Hedgehog pathway ( since could lead stem cell property cell express Notch ) ; host ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) polymorphism relevant gene Notch pathway ; tumor micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) level . VII . Trough level erlotinib RO4929097 measure plasma sample patient dose-escalation portion study approximately 24 hour cycle 1 , day 1 dose approximately 24 hour cycle 2 , day 1 dose . These measurement do permit preliminary exploratory assessment whether induction metabolism one drug lead decrease drug plasma concentration . VIII . In Expansion Cohort , plasma level erlotinib RO4929097 measure approximately 24 hour cycle 2 , day 21 erlotinib dose ( prior initiation cycle 3 ) , plasma level agent measure plasma approximately 24 hour cycle 3 , day 1 dose agent . These measurement do permit preliminary exploratory assessment whether : plasma drug level correlate % tumor shrinkage/response change tumor biomarkers first 6 week therapy ; erlotinib plasma concentration affect RO4929097 administration . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 gamma-secretase/Notch signal pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 week .</detailed_description>
