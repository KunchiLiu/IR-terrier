	<brief_title>Genetics Charcot Marie Tooth ( CMT ) - Modifiers CMT1A , New Causes CMT2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project understand modifier gene influence severity disease expression , along identify new form CMT genetically determine . Subjects eligible either CMT type 1A ( CMT1A ) unknown form CMT . Blood drawn send University Miami receive cod sample process exome sequencing . Subjects tell optional .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient MUST see person one clinical site involve study . Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A ( CMT1A ) modifier gene study Patient document PMP22 duplication OR Patient first second degree relative ( parent , child , sibling , halfsibling , aunt , uncle , grandparent , grandchild , niece , nephew ) document PMP22 duplication AND clear link family member affect patient AND phenotype consistent CMT1A . . A clear link necessary seconddegree relative . For example , grandparent affect PMP22 duplication , parent sign , symptom , electrophysiology consistent CMT1A , clear link . ii . In case clear link available , genetic testing require patient first degree family member clearly affect . AND Patient agree take part study sign consent form . A teenager ( age 1317 ) consider enrol must agree take part study sign assent form Inclusion Criteria CMT Exome Project 1 . Patient demonstrate neuropathy nerve conduction study clinically diagnose genetic neuropathy . 2 . Patient first second degree family member clear link describe CMT1A Inclusion Criteria part b negative MFN2 genetic testing , axonal form CMT ( nerve conduction great 38 m/s ) negative test PMP22 duplication , deletion , sequence , MPZ , GJB1 demyelinate form CMT present ( &lt; 38 m/s ) . 3 . More one family member willing eligible participate . . Sample pedigree show optimal degree relationship show . ii . Participation include able complete aspect study , include give informed consent , brief physical examination , provide DNA sample . d. Patient agree take part study sign consent form . e. A teenager ( age 1317 ) consider enrol must agree take part study sign assent form . Inclusion Criteria Controls 1 . Person peripheral neuropathy , determine investigator . 2 . Person understood study sign IRB approve consent form . Teenagers ( age 1317 year ) must sign assent form . 1 . Patient wish participate sign consent form . 2 . For CMT Exome Project , patient genetically confirm form CMT ( i.e . mutation MFN2 cause CMT2A , mutation GARS cause CMT2D , etc. ) . 3 . Known neuropathy nongenetic source , chemotherapy ( i.e . Vincristine , Taxol , Cisplatin ) , diabetes , alcoholism evaluate independently genetic contribution effect CMT1A phenotype also analyze .</criteria>
