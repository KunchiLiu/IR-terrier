	<detailed_description>The objective observational study determine natural history acute ischemic stroke large vessel thromboembolism brain . The target population stroke cohort know infarct volume present within 8 hour symptom onset NIH Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) score &gt; 10 . Functional outcome define modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) enrol patient follow 90 day index event . This prospective , single arm , multi-center trial . Up 200 patient 30 center enrol study . It anticipate 150 evaluable patient need analysis . The sample size estimate base primary study functional outcome 90 day define mRS 0-2 . Assuming observational study outcome 25 % ( 37/150 ) mRS 0-2 day 90 , expect two-sided exact binomial confidence interval ( 18 % , 32 % ) . This sample size adequate estimate mRS outcome 0-2 day 90 natural history acute ischemic stroke .</detailed_description>
