	<brief_title>RO4929097 Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Recently Completed Treatment With Front-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical activity gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) recently complete front-line chemotherapy advance disease . II . To assess whether percent change tumor size 6 week initiation RO4929097 correlate tumor expression Notch pathway marker stem cell marker and/or host genotype polymorphism select component Notch pathway . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether response RECIST criterion TTF correlate tumor expression Notch pathway marker stem cell marker and/or host genotype polymorphism select component Notch pathway . II . To compare tumor expression Notch pathway stem cell marker patient population expression marker tumor tumor bank chemo-naive NSCLC patient . III . To correlate expression Notch pathway marker expression stem cell marker . IV . To correlate host genotype polymorphism select component Notch pathway stem cell pathways tumor expression Notch pathway stem cell marker . V. To correlate presence tumor EGFR activate mutation : ) notch expression , b ) stem cell marker expression , c ) response RO4929097 . VI . To assess change expression Notch pathway marker stem cell marker 3 day therapy subset patient correlate : ) subsequent response therapy TTF , b ) change marker first 3 day therapy change marker interest change level tumor cell apoptosis TUNEL assay . VII . For patient pre chemotherapy tissue obtain , compare post chemotherapy ( pre RO4929097 ) expression Notch pathway stem cell marker observe pre chemotherapy tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tumor tissue sample collect pharmacogenetic , pharmacodynamic , biomarker study IHC , FISH , TUNEL assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
