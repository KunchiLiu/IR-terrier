	<brief_summary>The goal Phase I portion study find high tolerable dose azacitidine combine capecitabine oxaliplatin ( CAPOX ) give patient metastatic colorectal cancer . The goal Phase II portion study learn azacitidine , give combination CAPOX , help control metastatic colorectal cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine CAPOX Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Azacitidine design block certain protein cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting protein . By block `` bad '' protein , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . Capecitabine design interfere growth cancer cell . Oxaliplatin design keep new cancer cell grow . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 30 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose azacitidine oxaliplatin receive depend join study . All participant receive dose capecitabine . The first group participant receive low dose level combination . Each new group receive high dose combination group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose combination azacitidine , oxaliplatin , capecitabine find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive combination azacitidine , oxaliplatin , capecitabine high dose tolerate Phase I portion . Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) : Before begin receive oxaliplatin study , CVC place one already . A CVC sterile , flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Study Drug Administration : A cycle treatment define 21 day . Azacitidine injected skin Days 1-5 cycle . You receive oxaliplatin vein 2 hour Day 2 cycle . You take capecitabine mouth 2 time day Days 1-14 cycle . Capecitabine tablets take 12 hour apart , within 30 minute eat meal . Study Visits : Up 3 day Day 1 cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurosensory assessment . - Your performance status record . - You ask symptom and/or side effect may experience drug may take . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 5 Cycle 1 Days 1 5 Cycle 2 , receive study drug , blood ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn test CIMP , chemical `` marker '' blood may relate drug may affect cancer . After every 3 cycle ( Cycles 4 , 7 , 10 ) , CT MRI scan chest , abdomen , and/or pelvis check status disease . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long benefit . You take study drug disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest stop take study drug . If chose stop participation study time , tell study doctor study staff right away . They make sure proper procedure follow final visit make safety . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 10 day study treatment end reason , return clinic follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You neurosensory assessment . - Your performance status record . - You CT scan MRI scan chest , abdomen , and/or pelvis check status disease . - You ask symptom and/or side effect may experience drug may take . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Follow-Up : The study doctor study staff follow health status first 30 day stop take study drug check experience treatment-related side effect . The follow-up do regularly schedule routine clinic visit and/or phone call , last 5 minute . If continue experience treatment-related side effect 30 day follow-up , study staff continue follow regularly schedule clinic visit side effect get good become stable . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month end-of-treatment visit , study staff contact phone email check . If contact phone , call last 5 minute . Your medical record may also review . This investigational study . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS - blood disease often lead cancer ) . Its use colorectal cancer investigational . Oxaliplatin capecitabine FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal cancer . The use azacitidine , oxaliplatin , capecitabine combination investigational . Up 54 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
