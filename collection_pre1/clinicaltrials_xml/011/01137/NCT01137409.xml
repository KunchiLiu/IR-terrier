	<detailed_description>In clinical trial , patient suspect previously diagnose coronary artery disease clinically refer either treadmill exercise stress/rest SPECT study vasodilatation stress/rest SPECT study consider protocol . The vasodilation study may either adenosine regadenosin . In addition stress study , stress/rest echocardiography study first pas image also obtain . The reason include echocardiography provide independent measurement ejection fraction pharmacological stress comparison ejection fraction first pas study ECG-gated SPECT study perform rest . This evaluate add value calculation stress leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) gate SPECT rest EF . This information also assist evaluate LV dysfunction follow induction pharmacological stress Nuclear imaging compare echocardiographic stress EF , establish image modality assessment coronary heart disease . The study include two ECHO image session two SPECT image session . Patients undergo rest first pas image administration 99mTc-tetrofosmin ; rest ECHO study appropriate imaging time . The rest ECHO also use assess patient image window quality optimize equipment setting subsequent stress image . A rest gated-SPECT image acquire appropriate imaging time . The patient undergo standard vasodilation stress infusion . A first pas image obtain administration 99mTc-tetrofosmin . An ECHO obtain prior completion infusion . A gated-SPECT study perform appropriate imaging time . Tetrofosmin ECG-gated SPECT Imaging : One hundred patient enrolled vasodilation stress/rest ECG-gated SPECT myocardial perfusion image group . Imaging time session vary one half three hour . A one two day image protocol utilized . Depending image session do first ( rest stress ) , `` one-day '' protocol consist first dose 99mTc-Tetrofosmin low dose 10-15mCi . The second dose high dose 20-40mCi depend patient 's weight . In `` two-day '' protocol , patient receive high dose 99mTc-Tetrofosmin imaging session . The dose give depend patient 's weight . Rest Imaging : If venous access already establish , standard universal precaution 18-20 gauge catheter equip 3-way stopcock insert preferably antecubital vein . The patient inject appropriate amount 99mTc-Tetrofosmin . The first pas image acquire injection ( see first pass protocol ) . An Early resting gated-SPECT imaging ECHO do 15 minute repeat 60 minute ( see ECHO protocol ) . Adenosine Imaging : If venous access already establish , standard universal precaution 18-20 gauge catheter equip 3-way stopcock insert preferably antecubital vein . Patients receive infusion adenosine rate 140ug/kg/min . After 1.5 minute adenosine infusion , appropriate dose 99mTc-Tetrofosmin injected adenosine infusion continue 4.5 additional minute , compliance standard 6-minute infusion protocol current ASNC guideline . The first pas image acquire injection ( see first pass protocol ) . Blood pressure heart rate document every minute . 12 lead ECG obtain baseline print minute . There continuous monitoring ECG symptom throughout infusion . The ECHO acquire 2.5 min adenosine infusion ( see ECHO protocol ) . An Early resting gated-SPECT imaging ECHO do 15 minute post infusion repeat 60 minute . Test Termination End Points ( standard criterion ) - Symptomatic hypotension , bradycardia high degree AV Block - Severe shortness breath wheeze - Completion protocol - ST Segment depression &gt; 2mm ( horizontal downsloping ) - Angina - Life threaten arrhythmia - Subject request stop Regadenoson Imaging : If venous access already establish , standard universal precaution 18-20 gauge catheter equip 3-way stopcock insert preferably antecubital vein . Patients receive infusion Regadenoson ( 0.4 mg regadenoson ) rapid intravenous injection ; follow immediately 5 ml saline flush . 20-40 second saline flush Tetrofosmin inject first pas image do . Patients receive infusion Regadenoson rate ( 0.4 mg regadenoson ) . After 1.5 minute Regadenoson infusion , appropriate dose 99mTc-Tetrofosmin injected Regadenoson infusion continue 4.5 additional minute , compliance standard 6-minute infusion protocol current ASNC guideline . The first pas image acquire injection ( see first pass protocol ) . Blood pressure heart rate document every minute . 12 lead ECG obtain baseline print minute . There continuous monitoring ECG symptom throughout infusion . The ECHO acquire 2.5 min Regadenoson infusion ( see ECHO protocol ) . An Early resting gated-SPECT imaging ECHO do 15 minute post infusion repeat 60 minute . Test Termination End Points ( standard criterion ) - Symptomatic hypotension , bradycardia high degree AV Block - Severe shortness breath wheeze - Completion protocol - ST Segment depression &gt; 2mm ( horizontal downsloping ) - Angina - Life threaten arrhythmia - Subject request stop Treadmill Exercise ( Stress ) Imaging : If venous access already establish , standard universal precaution 18-20 gauge catheter equip 3-way stopcock insert preferably antecubital vein . Patients follow preset treadmill protocol . ECG 's continuously monitor exercise print stage exercise . Patients injected appropriate amount 99mTc-Tetrofosmin . The first pas image acquire injection ( see first pass protocol ) . Due logistical difficulty , ECHO perform image session . Test Termination End Points ( standard criterion ) - Severe Fatigue - ST segment depression elevation &gt; 2mm ( horizontal downsloping ) - Severe Angina - Severe Shortness breath/ wheeze - Significant drop ( 20mmHG ) blood pressure - Significant elevation blood pressure : - Systolic : &gt; 220mmHG - Diastolic : &gt; 120mmHG - Severe low extremity discomfort - Signs severe peripheral circulatory insufficiency : lightheadedness , nausea , pallor - Onset second third degree AV Block - Ventricular Tachycardia - Symptomatic SVT - Patient request stop - Completion Protocol - For Nuclear Imaging Study , patient reach 85 % age predict maximum heart rate prior injection radioisotope ( 220-age ) . Once target reach isotope inject patient exercise 2 minute post injection Echocardiography Imaging : Instrument setting optimize ensure best delineation endocardial border leave ventricle . Rest ECHO obtain standard protocol image group . Patients adenosine vasodilatation stress group ECHO infusion adenosine standard view . Patients exercise stress group ECHO immediately exercise standard view . Patients group ECHO 15 minute 60 minute stress . 2D 3D- Echocardiography Views Primary view : - Apical four chamber 2D view ( 2D color tissue Doppler ) - Apical two chamber 2D view ( 2D color tissue Doppler ) - Apical 3D view Secondary 2D view : - Parasternal short axis base , mid apex LV ( 2D color tissue Doppler ) - Parasternal long axis First Pass Radionuclide Angiography : Patients prepped outline previously include IV placement . For rest image , patient connect camera gate device continuous registration ECG . Patients place face camera begin isotope infusion . The camera detect presence isotope within SVC initiate record data ; real time acquisition progress display computer screen . During acquisition treadmill exercise image , patient connect camera gate device continuous registration ECG . Patients place face camera . The height camera set patient `` Treadmill track '' set `` ON '' position . At peak exercise , isotope inject . The camera detect presence isotope within SVC initiate record data ; real time acquisition progress display computer screen . During acquisition adenosine vasodilatation image , patient connect camera gate device continuous registration ECG . Patients place face camera . The isotope infuse 1.5 minute adenosine infusion . The camera detect presence isotope within SVC initiate record data ; real time acquisition progress display computer screen . The total image time first pas study 30 second .</detailed_description>
