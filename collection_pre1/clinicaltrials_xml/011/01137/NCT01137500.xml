	<brief_summary>Various haemodynamic change observe laparoscopic surgery , relate insufflation CO2 &amp; patient position . Cardiac output calculation use oesophageal doppler monitoring base assumption aortic diameter fix . This study aim measure aortic diameter preset time surgery use ultrasound discover diameter remain , hence assumption make oesophageal monitor reliable . Assessing aortic diameter involve noninvasive ultrasound measurement take patient electively laparoscopic procedure Royal Surrey County Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Aortic Diameter During Laparoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose design : This study aim measure aortic diameter preset time surgery use ultrasound discover diameter remain , hence assumption make oesophageal monitor reliable . Assessing aortic diameter involve noninvasive ultrasound measurement take patient electively laparoscopic procedure Royal Surrey County Hospital . Recruitment : Patients undergo elective laparoscopic procedure Royal Surrey County Hospital . Recruitment do Dr M Dickinson Dr M Scott ( COnsultant Anaesthetists ) . No therapeutic promise make purely observational study . Inclusion / exclusion : Patient refusal , Surgical refusal , Conversion open procedure . Consent : Informed consent gain participant . Risks , burden benefit : This observational study use non invasive technique patient undergo elective surgery . There little way risk , burden benefit patient . Confidentiality : Caldicott principle adhere . Conflict interest : None . Use tissue sample future research : None .</detailed_description>
