	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Patients With Relapsed Acute Myeloid Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several publish study demonstrate vitro anti-leukemic activity carfilzomib leukemia cell line well primary human acute myeloid acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell . The anti-leukemic activity carfilzomib consistently potent bortezomib , particularly dose ≥27mg/m2 . Importantly , patient treat phase I phase II carfilzomib trial low rate treatment-associated neuropathy . Several large collaborative group current phase II clinical trial incorporate bortezomib treatment regimen acute myeloid acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Thus , strong rationale study carfilzomib , potentially potent proteasome inhibitor less toxicity , patient relapse acute leukemia .</detailed_description>
