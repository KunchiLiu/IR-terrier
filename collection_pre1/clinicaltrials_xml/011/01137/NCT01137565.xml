	<criteria>Male and/or female subject ≥12 &lt; 18 year age ( Cohorts 1 , 2 , 3 indicate study design ) . Male and/or nonreproductive female subject 18 50 year age , inclusive ( cohort 4 ) . Females nonreproductive potential must document medical history ( ie , postmenopausal history menses 1 year folliclestimulating hormone value ( FSH ) consistent postmenopausal status per laboratory range ; OR history hysterectomy ; OR history bilateral tubal ligation ; OR history bilateral oophorectomy ) . Females childbearing potential female document nonreproductive potential must agree use highly effective method birth control duration study 2 week study drug administration . Males whose partner child bear potential must agree use highly effective method birth control duration study continue 12 week study drug administration . Highly effective method birth control ( i.e. , failure rate le 1 % per year ) include sexual abstinence ( male , female ) , vasectomy condom supplement use spermicide ( male ) occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) , hormonal birth control , intrauterine device ( IUD ) use female partner . Male subject whose partner become pregnant study must practice sexual abstinence use condom spermicide two week follow study drug administration ensure unborn child potentially expose AMG 853 via semen . The pregnant partner information report Amgen per Pregnancy Notification Worksheet . Intermittent mild moderate persistent asthma past 3 month ( defined 2004 Global Initiative Asthma [ GINA ] guideline ) . On stable pharmacologic regimen treatment asthma least 3 month prior study enrollment anticipate change regimen course study . Forced Expiry Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) screen visit ≥ 70 % predict normal value ( without aid bronchodilator ) . FEV1 reversibility great equal 12 % baseline within 30 minute inhale ( 400 μg ) nebulized ( 5 mg ) albuterol office screen visit . Subjects unable demonstrate reversibility screening , must provide recent evidence document reversibility Amgen Medical Monitor principal investigator review . Clinically acceptable physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , clinical laboratory test value population test . Any abnormal clinical laboratory result and/or ECG value must discuss Sponsor . History evidence clinically significant disorder , condition disease , opinion investigator Amgen physician , would pose risk subject safety interfere study evaluation , procedure , completion . Experienced asthma exacerbation ( defined disease episode result treatment emergency room urgent care facility , episode treated oral corticosteroid ) 3 month prior study enrollment . Hospitalized asthma 6 month prior study enrollment ; ever intubate treatment asthma . Use oral corticosteroid within 3 month prior study enrollment . Evidence recent ( within 2 week study enrollment ) current sign symptom upper respiratory infection ( eg , viral , bacterial ) . Known positive tuberculin skin test ( treated appropriate chemoprophylaxis ) untreated exposure patient active tuberculosis . History autoimmune disorder ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus ) . Creatinine clearance within screen period le 80 mL/min calculate CockcroftGault method . History clinically significant cardiovascular , renal , hepatic respiratory disease asthma . History suggestive esophageal , gastric , duodenal ulceration bowel disease ( include limit peptic ulceration , gastrointestinal bleeding , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease irritable bowel syndrome ) , history gastrointestinal surgery ( exclude uncomplicated appendectomy ) . Any positive test cotinine ( tobacco use ) day dose . A positive cotinine level define level exceed upper limit normal per local laboratory reference range . Known substance abuse ( eg , alcohol , licit illicit drug ) within 1 year dosing define Diagnostic Statistical Manual version 4 , text revsion ( DSMIVTR ) criterion . Any positive test drug alcohol use day dose ( day 1 ) . For subject legal drinking age , alcohol consume within 48 hour day 1 throughout study . Alcohol use permit subject legal drinking age . Positive pregnancy test screen day 1 . Females lactate breastfeeding . pregnant partner . Inability unwillingness swallow tablet . A history malignancy type , surgically excise nonmelanomatous skin cancer situ cervical cancer within 5 year day dose . Donated great 500 mL blood blood product within 60 day dose . Subjects receive investigational drug ( use investigational device ) within 30 day receive first dose study medication , least 5 elimination halflives ( whichever longer ) . Subjects previously expose AMG 853 . Use prescription ( eg , angiotensin inhibitor ) nonprescription [ eg , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) ] medication include asthma medication ( eg , inhaled cromolyn , inhaled ipratropium , inhaled tiotropium , theophylline ) within 7 day study start exception inhale corticosteroid therapy ( ≤ 660 μg/day fluticasone ≤ 480 μg/day beclomethasone , equivalent ) , inhale shortacting longacting β2 agonist , montelukast . Use overthecounter prescription medication ( specifically include , limited antacid , H2 blocker , proton pump inhibitor , aspirin NSAIDS within 28 day dose . Acetaminophen ( 2 g per day ) analgesia hormone replacement therapy ( eg , estrogen ) allow . Use known inhibitor CYP3A4/Pgp ketoconazole , itraconazole , HIV protease inhibitor , nefazadone , cyclosporine , erythromycin , clindamycin , tetracycline , clarithromycin within 14 day 5 half life , whichever longer ; grapefruit juice grapefruit containing product within 7 day prior investigational product administration . Use known CYP inducer rifampin , oral corticosteroid , anticonvulsant within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , investigational product administration . All herbal medicine ( eg , St. John 's Wort ) , vitamin , supplement consume subject within 30 day prior first dose investigational product , continue use appropriate , review Principal Investigator Amgen Medical Monitor . History hypersensitivity allergic reaction sulfonamide drug . Positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C antibody . Known history Gilbert 's syndrome . Unwilling unable return research facility followup assessment require per protocol . Any condition might reduce chance obtain data ( eg , know poor compliance ) require protocol might compromise ability give truly informed consent .</criteria>
