	<brief_summary>The purpose study well understand Spinal Cord Stimulator work relieve chronic pain . The investigator ask subject take part study chronic pain patient already Spinal Cord Stimulator ( SCS ) place . The investigator hypothesize chronic pain patient higher heat pain threshold , heat pain tolerance wind-up painful area SCS . QST ( Quantitative Sensory Testing , heat/cold simulation test ) might objective helpful tool prudent patient selection expensive invasive procedure future SCS placement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty subject already implant SCS device pain management MGH Center Pain Medicine Partners affiliate pain center enrol . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Subject 18 year old . 2 . Subject SCS device implant least one month pain control . This requirement set ensure subject becomes familiarize therapy recover surgical implantation SCS device . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Subject neurological disease condition cause sensory deficit painful area . 2 . Subject recent therapy may influence QST result , e.g. , neuroablative procedure within two-months . 3 . Subjects unable travel study center . It one time outpatient visit study , include follow : 1 . Brief pain history Neurological examination - Medical History ( include medication use ) ; - Pain location , intensity , character know , etiology , duration ; - Maps pain location paresthesia location ; - Sensory neurological examination ( e.g. , alcohol swab , cotton swab , pinprick vibration ) ; - A check routine vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , pulse oximetry ) . 2 . QST include follow : - Warm sensation , heat pain threshold , heat pain tolerance wind-up . A cut-off 53°C heat preset avoid tissue damage . - QST do three area ; painful area , non-painful area paresthesia non-painful area without paresthesia SCS turn . - Subject turn SCS repeat QST perform three mention area . - QST test perform quiet room temperature 25º 2° C. The time duration QST test record . QST perform least 4 hour later 6 hour last dose long act opioid last SCS time . In way investigator try avoid record possible end dose withdrawal provide sufficient time subject return baseline SCS therapy .</detailed_description>
