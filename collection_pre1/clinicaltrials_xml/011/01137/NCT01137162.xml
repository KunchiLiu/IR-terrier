	<brief_summary>Cetuximab , erlotinib , panitumumab recently FDA approve epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor treat wide variety tumor type , colon , lung , head neck . Blockade EGFR result inhibition multiple downstream pathway , lead slow tumor growth . In addition , inhibitor may enhance anti-tumor immune response uncharacterized mechanism . While produce significant response many setting , EGFR inhibitor also result significant skin toxicity ( rash ) high percentage patient . Multiple study correlate presence severity rash clinical response . Unfortunately , severe rash often lead dose delay , reduction , even discontinuation EGFR inhibitor , thus limit efficacy . The mechanism rash correlation tumor response poorly understood . Skin biopsy display robust leukocyte infiltrate , systematic analysis type infiltrate leukocyte , activation state , home receptor expression perform . Chemokines chemokine receptor control leukocyte trafficking skin tissue site , define receptor profile skin- , gut- , lung-homing leukocyte well establish . In study , investigator propose evaluate homing phenotype leukocytes peripheral blood skin biopsy patient receive EGFR inhibitor . The investigator use RNA microarrays evaluate expression chemokines key gene regulate skin treatment . The investigator utilize vitro method investigate effect EGFR inhibitor imprint T cell tissue-specific homing receptor . The investigator examine correlation among pathologic data , clinical finding , tumor response . If validate , peripheral blood evaluation could potentially use predictive indicator patient receive EGFR inhibitor . This study may also identify novel target limit skin toxicity receive EGFR inhibitor , thus allow maximal dose clinical response agent .</brief_summary>
