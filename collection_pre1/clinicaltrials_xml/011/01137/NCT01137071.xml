	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , Hu3S193 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well Hu3S193 work consolidation therapy woman relapse platinum-sensitive ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Consolidation Therapy With Hu3S193 Women With Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II multicenter trial Hu3S193 single agent consolidation strategy patient relapse platinum-sensitive ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube cancer achieve second Complete Response platinum-based chemotherapy platinum-based chemotherapeutical regimen . Fifty-one ( 51 ) patient relapse platinum-sensitive ovarian , primary peritoneal fallopian tube adenocarcinoma receive dos 30 mg/m2 Hu3S193 single agent every two week , total 12 dos ( treatment period duration : 23 week ) . After treatment period , patient evaluate every 3 month first two year , every 6 month 3 year , annual-basis disease progression death , whichever happen first .</detailed_description>
