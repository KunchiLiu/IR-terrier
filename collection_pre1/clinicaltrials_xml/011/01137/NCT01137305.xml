	<brief_summary>Background hypothesis : Virtual reality ( VR ) train minimal invasive surgery ( MIS ) know feasible beneficial surgical residency . Research stress- cop surgical trainee indicate additional impact soft skill VR- performance . Thus hypothesize soft skill predict surgical performance VR- setting . Method : A prospective randomized control single center educational trial carry evaluate impact structure VR- training define soft skill self- efficacy , stress- cop motivation VR- performance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method : Eligibility criterion surgical residency exceed first year surgical training , limited experience MIS inform consent study procedure include anonymized publication study data . Limited experience MIS define camera navigation laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Fifty resident enrol prospectively randomize either three month structure VR- train training . Every participant underwent basic VR- skill assessment serial assessment define soft skill include self- efficacy , stress- coping motivation prior randomization . Basic VR- skill measure within seven module VR- simulator LapSim® ( Surgical Science , Goteborg , Sweden ) include `` camera instrument navigation '' , `` coordination '' , `` grasping '' , `` lift grasping '' , `` clip applying '' `` diathermy cutting '' . Each module perform two level difficulty- medium hard . Means defined parameter VR- performance generate . Defined parameter VR- performance comprise `` time complete task '' , `` economy instrument motion '' `` tissue damage '' . Serial assessment define soft skill comprise standardized psychological paper- pencil questionnaires regard self efficacy ( GSE ) , stress coping ( SVF 78 ) motivation ( QCM ) . Participants randomized intervention group pas session 45 minute twice week three month . Participants randomize control group underwent training . Three month randomization , VR- performance assess likewise . Outcome measurement VR- performance define result derive complex module `` diathermy- cutting '' endpoint . The study approve local ethic committee . Participation study voluntary . Data blind investigator . The data descriptively analyse use SPSS® software version 16.0 ( SSPS® , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) . Spearman regression analysis perform correlate mean virtual laparoscopic performance result derive serial psychological testing . The difference randomize group assess mean non- parametric Mann-Whitney- Test regarding parameter , laparoscopic performance well psychological score . Relation mean carry use two- independent t- Test . The level statistical significance set p &lt; 0.050 ( two-tailed ) .</detailed_description>
