	<brief_summary>This Phase II , randomize , open-label , multi-center study evaluate efficacy safety lapatinib combination chemotherapy versus trastuzumab combination chemotherapy woman HER2-positive p95HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) . Eligible subject newly diagnose metastatic breast cancer ( Stage IV ) either primary diagnosis recurrence follow treatment curative intent ; receive systemic local treatment MBC breast cancer positive HER2 p95HER2 . The primary objective compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) lapatinib plus chemotherapy versus trastuzumab plus chemotherapy first-line treatment subject MBC exhibit concurrent HER2 overexpression ( and/or gene amplification ) expression carboxy-terminal fragment HER2 ( p95HER2 ) . The secondary objective evaluate overall survival , overall response rate , clinical benefit response rate safety well tolerability lapatinib plus chemotherapy trastuzumab plus chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
