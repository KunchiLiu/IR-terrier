	<brief_title>Bacterial Host Genetic Risk Factors Acute Pyelonephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) common serious bacterial infection young child , acute pyelonephritis APN ( i.e. , kidney/upper urinary tract infection ) APN-associated renal scarring cause potential long-term damage child 's health . Approximately two-thirds young child febrile UTI ( UTIF UTI present fever ) APN , make UTIF major indicator APN . Other presence fever , currently difficult physician determine infant patient develop APN renal scarring . Individual risk factor host ( e.g. , uncircumcised male , cytokine production ) pathogen ( e.g. , presence fimbriae adhesion ) individually link APN renal scarring , single trait identify correlated case . Multiple factor side host-pathogen relationship likely interact determine severity illness outcome . Although NIDDK/NIH currently fund two clinical trial investigate rate recurrent UTI rate renal scar child ( Randomized Intervention Children Vesicoureteral REflux , RIVUR ; Careful urinary Tract Infection Evaluation , CUTIE ) neither study able identify child 's initial risk APN since patient recruitment occur long treatment UTI . Also , neither study propose specific goal obtain bacteriological sample study microbe 's role pathogenesis APN . Thus , best knowledge , comprehensive study exist aim analyze relationship clinical manifestation UTIs , host risk factor immune response , microbial specie cause condition . Our propose collaborative study Children 's National Medical Center ( CNMC ) J. Craig Venter Institute ( JCVI ) collect clinical data well urine blood sample six distinct infant patient population present UTIF correlate clinical , host , pathogen data patient severity disease development APN renal scarring . Metagenomic genomic sequence urine isolate bacteria , respectively , allow u comprehensively study culturable unculturable pathogen responsible UTI . Using genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) evaluate polymorphism know UTI-associated host gene , pay particular attention immune system host gene previously identify potentially link APN . To correlate collect data publicly available database website create allow physician scientist traverse data . Using data collect database , final result study clinical severity score personalize diagnostic treatment strategy infant UTIF , goal decrease morbidity APN improve patient outcome . An improved understanding microbial risk factor associate APN renal scarring allow well diagnostic approach improve method treat patient , inclusive novel medication risk individual .</detailed_description>
