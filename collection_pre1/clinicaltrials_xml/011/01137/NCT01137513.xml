	<detailed_description>IRB Application III : Title : T-Wave Alternans Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients Objective : Chest Pain common high-risk presenting symptom Emergency Department . One central challenge Emergency Physicians face differentiate cardiac cause chest pain non-cardiac cause . A rich array mature technology exist aid process . None , however , show adequate sensitivity within first 12-18 hour symptom reliably exclude cardiac ischemia . As result many patient admit Coronary Care Units period observation typically involve serial blood analysis continuous cardiac monitoring . An estimated $ 13 billion dollar per year devote `` Rule-out MI '' process . The majority , typically 80 % , patient ultimately find cardiac disease . That , chest pain ascribed gastro-esophageal reflux , esophageal chest wall muscle spasm explanation symptom . While test reliably discriminate cardiac non-cardiac symptom emergency department , test improve ability identify subset patient safe discharge would immense utility reduce unnecessary hospital admission . Background : In past 15 year T-Wave Alternans ( TWA ) test become accepted among cardiac electrophysiologists mean identify patient high risk ventricular arrhythmia . TWA test typically perform conjunction cardiac stress test involve computerize analysis EKG subtle alternate beat variation amplitude T-wave segment . The test completely non-invasive , return result immediately , perform compact , portable equipment . An extensive body literature emerge demonstrate test 's high negative predictive value various group patient regard ventricular tachyarrhythmias sudden cardiac death . For example , Rosenbaum study patient refer electrophysiological testing due high clinical suspicion risk sudden cardiac death . His landmark paper ( Electrical Alternans vulnerability ventricular Arrhythmias , N Engl J Med 1994 ; 330:235-41 ) find positive TWA test identify subset patient group 81 % mortality 20 month versus 6 % test negative . The predictive value TWA test cardiac arrhythmia group equivalent invasive electrophysiological testing . Numerous subsequent study corroborate finding specific patient population Post-MI patient , Congestive Heart Failure patient , patient Syncope . TWA test approve ( Nov 2001 ) Medicare reimbursement approximately $ 260 per test . The `` HearTwave System '' Cambridge Heart Inc ( Boston MA ) gain FDA approval Apr 2001 test `` patient risk ventricular arrhythmia . '' The test validate context traditional cardiac stress test much clinical literature utility test context . Specifically , report applicability TWA test Emergency Department patient acute chest pain . Verrier et al . ( J Amer Coll Cardiol 2001 ; 37:1719-25 ) find animal study emotional stress profound multiplicative effect magnitude TWA cause cardiac ischemia . This research support idea emotional stress present Emergency Department acute chest pain shortness breath might effective substitute stress provocative cardiac stress test ( treadmill pharmacologic stress test ) induce . If true , would great interest Emergency Physicians measure predictive value TWA cardiac ischemia patient `` stress '' acute chest pain . In 2003 , perform preliminary study Loma Linda University ED test research question . We monitor 100 acute chest pain ED patient use HearTwave TWA monitor . We determine TWA set relatively common , amplitude TWA seem correlate highly presence cardiac ischemia . The result work presented several local one national meeting academic Emergency Physicians receive enthusiasm . A problem result related limitation HearTwave device . The HearTwave design use conjunction exercise stress test require heart rate increase threshold ( 105 beat per minute ) test proceeds . Because recording do `` passively '' patient rest , data inappropriate proprietary algorithm use HearTwave analysis require different processing technique qualitative rather quantitative . Even , able demonstrate TWA activity patient heart rate much low threshold ( 60 beats/minute ) 100 % sensitive cardiac ischemia level specificity approximately 50 % . In present proposal , seek IRB approval protocol similar use . The main difference use device give u access raw data enable u apply numerical processing algorithms measure TWA . The study look TWA test observational study approximately 500 emergency department patient present symptom suggestive cardiac ischemia . The study conduct Loma Linda University Medical Center ( LLUMC ) academic institution 44,000 Emergency Department visit per year . All emergency Department patient age 18 older evaluate possible Acute Coronary Syndrome eligible . Actual testing perform medical student complete 1-hour training course use electrocardiographic instrument . Methods : The device employ test FDA approve ECG probe enable capture filter ECG signal digital storage . The testing procedure essentially identical standard ECG recording . Ten electrode apply patient 's chest configuration interfere standard lead placement . The patient connect via electrical lead device operator press button initiate measurement cycle . The complete test process typically take 5-15 minute . No action require patient anyone else test initiate . Results store automatically later review . The result test make available treating physician influence treatment decision . Performing test interfere way delivery standard acute care patient . Testing non-invasive - stimulate current deliver patient . The instrument design use standard electrode . Following testing , patient ' data process several way . There two standard algorithm describe literature measure TWA - `` Spectral Analysis '' method , `` Modified Moving Average '' method . In addition two method , use Neural Network Techniques analyze data . These method allow quantitative determination degree TWA present data . We examine predictive value TWA test various measure cardiac morbidity base discharge diagnosis , result cardiac testing , presence ventricular arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , need revascularization . Follow-up make telephone patient family 3 month post test assess occurrence death , myocardial infarction , revascularization . The central question guide research extent TWA test aid process early risk stratification acute chest pain patient . We particularly interested negative predictive value test clinically low-risk patient . Risks : Minimal risk patient . Benefits : Individual participant benefit directly participation . If TWA test show utility identify patient low risk ischemic complication result would immense value guide appropriate use clinical resource future patient context . Compensation : Patients compensated participation . Consent : An investigator discus risk , benefit objective study . Written inform consent obtain prior participation patient study . Because logistics study substantially preliminary IRB approve study , use consent form substantially equivalent use preliminary study . Subjects give write copy T-Wave Alternans Acute Chest Pain inform consent sheet . Confidentiality : TWA test result use research purpose remain confidential .</detailed_description>
