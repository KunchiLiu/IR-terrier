	<brief_title>Gastrointestinal Dysfunction Children Affected With Mitochondrial Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific AIM : To study gastric empty time child mitochondrial disorder . INTRODUCTION : Mitochondrial disorder recently describe group metabolic disorder complex presentation ; child present myriad symptom involvement wide array organ system . Mitochondrial disorder result dysfunction protein ribosomes utilized mitochondrion . Mitochondrial dysfunction cause lack ATP production without enough ATP cell unable perform biological function . The first mitochondrial disease describe 1962 . Over last 40 year , mitochondrial disease become increasingly recognize important group genetic disorder . The prevalence report high one 3000 child , approach childhood cancer . Mitochondrial disorder classically describe affect tissue high demand ATP , i.e. , brain , muscle , nerve , heart , liver . Increasing diagnosis patient mitochondrial disease lead expansion know spectrum systemic involvement . Many child mitochondrial disorder gastrointestinal manifestation , predominately constipation poor gastrointestinal motility . Poor motility effect feed many patient intolerant oral feeding require mechanical feeding survive . Currently prove treatment strategy child mitochondrial disorder . Most current management strategy nonspecific target symptom control limited utility success . Study Methods : We plan conduct large , prospective cohort study 25 child mitochondrial disorder . Subjects include child different subclass various mitochondrial disease subgroup meet modified Walker criterion diagnosis probable definite mitochondrial disorder . Gastric empty time measure assess gastrointestinal motility , function , dynamic . Research Design Methods : Participants study recruit prospectively University Texas ( UT ) Mitochondrial Clinic . All mitochondrial patient probable definite mitochondrial disorder 3 18 year age see University Texas Mitochondrial Clinic invite participate . The decision participate participate research study way affect medical care offer clinician involve UT Mitochondrial Clinic . Consent study participation obtain Principal Investigator ( PI ) co-investigator ( CI ) designate clinical nurse person copy sign consent form retain file PI , place patient 's research medical record ( separate clinic record ) . For minor participation ( 12 17 year ) parental permission consent child obtain . For minor participation ( 7 11 year ) parental permission assent child obtain . For minor participation ( birth 6 year ) , parental permission obtain This study population consist cohort patient different subset mitochondrial disorder , include child isolated deficiency electron transport chain child syndromic mitochondrial disorder . Final analysis evaluate result individually subclass group , ie , Complex I deficiency , MELAS ( mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis stroke-like syndrome ) , etc . Research design : Patients undergo test gastric empty scan radiology department . The study would perform use Technetium-99 tracer UT radiologist David Wan , MD . Patient would report morning study NPO would drink tracer . The transit contrast material stomach would monitor evaluate regularly schedule X Rays stomach final result would interpret normal , delay significantly delay . Risks Benefits : The risk study largely confine maintain patient confidentiality . There personal benefit participant/family . No payment offer exchange study participation . Successful development patient database provide valuable information natural history complicate disorder . Information derive database publish peer review medical journal ; however individual would identify personal information would keep confidential . A potential benefit scientific community great understanding clinical course expect laboratory value observe person mitochondrial disease . There foreseeable risk research staff . Confidentiality : All participant ' name information keep strictly confidential . All participant assign subject ID number individual identification number . The code link name subject ID number maintain lock file office PI spread sheet file office computer PI . All subsequent reference patient data anonymous form patient identification number . Determine gastric empty time child mitochondrial disorder abnormal . There known risk perform gastric empty scan study child . The risk allergy eggs/food similar observe child similar age group minimal . RISKS : Risk associate allergic reaction dye also similar one observe child similar age group minimal . Risk associate breach confidentiality- minimal . The names identification information pertinent patient 's identity test result would strictly keep confidential patient would never identify name piece information public anyone else relate study . Patient 's test result would also release insuring company directly indirectly . Risk associate procedure- The procedure safe perform child age group include one suffer chronic disorder like mitochondrial disorder time . Our radiologist familiar nature medical disorder child present comfortable perform procedure safe timely manner .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Parents/Guardians inform give write consent . 2 . Subject willing able comply trial requirement 3 . Subject 3 year age . 4 . Subject diagnosis mitochondrial disorder validate modified Walker criterion use diagnosis mitochondrial disease ( 9 ) . 5 . A female subject age group 11 yr . old pregnant evidence negative urine dipstick pregnancy test 6 . Subject enrol one follow gastrointestinal sign symptom pertain gastrointestinal dysfunction like limited abdominal pain , nausea , vomit , bloating , indigestion , abdominal distention sense abdominal fullness . 1 . Subject currently one gastrointestinal disease/disorder explain current knowledge mitochondrial disease . For example , patient suffer peptic ulcer disease inflammatory bowel disease exclude . 2 . Subject pregnant nursing female .</criteria>
