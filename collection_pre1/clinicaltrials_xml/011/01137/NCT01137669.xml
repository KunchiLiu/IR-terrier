	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety license zoster vaccine , ZOSTAVAX® ( Zoster Vaccine Live ) 40 subject , age 18 year old , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) schedule receive living donor kidney transplant . ZOSTAVAX® license use immunosuppressed person United States individual le 50 year age . Subjects receive either ZOSTAVAX® vaccine placebo ( inactive substance ) less 4 week prior kidney transplant . Study procedures include : physical exam , blood sample documentation daily temperature and/or side effect diary follow vaccination . Participants may involve study related procedure 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infection varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) produce life-long latent infection sensory ganglion . Reactivation viral replication latency result number clinical syndrome , commonly herpes zoster , shingle . Herpes zoster typically unilateral vesicular rash dermatomal distribution accompany radicular pain may severe . Immunocompromised person high risk herpes zoster immunocompetent adult . The markedly increase risk herpes zoster organ transplant recipient suggest population would benefit substantially similar strategy could adopt . The currently license zoster vaccine , ZOSTAVAX® ( Zoster Vaccine Live ) , license use immunosuppressed person United States less 50 year age . A small Phase I study important address immunogenicity patient Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) prior transplantation well safety persistence immune response follow transplantation . This study multi-center , double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial ZOSTAVAX® immunization subject undergo renal transplantation live donor wait-listed decease donor le 4 week prior transplantation . The primary objective study assess safety ZOSTAVAX® administer subject CKD minimum 4 week prior live donor renal transplantation . This accomplished comparing rate specific local systemic reactogenicity event adverse event ( AEs ) vaccine placebo group . Subjects likely suitable renal transplant identify live donor consent screen serology antibody VZV serology standard care serostatus know . Subjects positive VZV serology , identify live donor , meet inclusion exclusion criterion provide sign informed consent study enrollment . Subjects randomize receive either active vaccine ( ZOSTAVAX® ) [ 30 subject ] placebo vaccine [ 10 subject ] . Blood drawn day 0 ( day vaccine ) prior vaccine administration assessment baseline humoral cellular immunity VZV . Subjects receive ZOSTAVAX® placebo vaccination . At approximately 5 week post-vaccination , subject blood drawn measurement humoral cellular immune response . Subjects undergo live donor renal transplant immunosuppression accord standard care institution . All transplanted subject receive anti-viral prophylaxis 3 month post-transplant , consist either valganciclovir ( ganciclovir ) acyclovir ( valacyclovir famciclovir ) depend risk cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) disease . Subjects follow treated renal transplant team center accord local standard care concomitant monitoring vaccine study team . Subjects blood drawn humoral cell-mediated immune assay day 0 , week 5 post vaccination , 6 month 12 month post-transplantation undergo transplantation . Parent protocol sub-study 09-0025 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must willing able provide inform consent prior study procedure . Age 18 year old time vaccination . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) activate United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) decease donor waitlist anticipate live donor renal transplant sooner 4 week follow vaccination . Varicella Zoster Virus ( VZV ) seropositive local laboratory Center Disease Control ( CDC ) serologic test Negative pregnancy test ( woman childbearing age potential ) perform enrollment within 48 hour prior . The use contraception woman childbearing potential per renal transplant team 's standard care Any pharmacologic immunosuppression time enrollment , within one year prior enrollment , enrollment transplant ( e.g. , underlying autoimmune disease previous fail allograft ) . This include prednisone &gt; /= 0.3 mg/kg/day steroid equivalent &gt; 10 day , use antimetabolite ( azathioprine , mycophenolic acid , cytoxan ) , leflunomide , TNFalpha inhibitor , calcineurin inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor , IL6 IL6 receptor inhibitor . Any transplant solitary kidney ( e.g. , kidney/pancreas , kidney/liver transplant ) . Second kidney transplant permit . Anticipated use posttransplant experimental immunosuppressive agent Prior ZOSTAVAX® Varivax® vaccination Shingles herpes zoster within 12 month plan vaccination Receipt kill vaccine within 2 week prior 4 week follow study vaccination receipt live vaccine within 4 week prior 6 week follow study vaccination Intercurrent illness time plan vaccination Inability vaccinate either arm ( e.g . due AV fistula graft ) Known Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , chronic hepatitis B determine review laboratory data obtain pretransplant evaluation renal transplant team . Note positive IgG hepatitis B surface antibody alone ( negative HBcAb negative IgM ) indicative vaccine induce immunity ground exclusion History anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction gelatin , neomycin , component vaccine Asthma require systemic inhaled steroid treatment within 12 month prior enrollment Allergy ganciclovir , valgancyclovir , acyclovir , famciclovir Panel Reactive Antibody ( PRA ) &gt; /= 20 percent donorspecific sensitization ( solid phase assay flow cytometry ) treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) desensitization prior transplant History primary acquire immunodeficiency state . Routine use antiviral prophylaxis Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) time vaccination within 3 month prior Any condition opinion investigator might interfere subject 's safety ability participate study Abnormal screen laboratory data result disqualification transplant candidacy . Abnormalities due underlying disease ( e.g. , renal failure , anemia , hyperlipidemia , cardiovascular disease , diabetes ) exclusionary except denoted HIV , hepatitis B , hepatitis C , autoimmune disease . The subject currently participate study involve experimental agent ( vaccine , drug , biologic , device , blood product , medication ) receive experimental agent within 1 month prior enrollment study , expect receive another experimental agent participation study . The subject diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar disease , severe ( disable ) psychiatric diagnosis identify pretransplant evaluation . The subject hospitalize within past 5 year prior enrollment psychiatric illness , history suicide attempt confinement danger self others identify pretransplant evaluation . Dual list one transplant center . Unwilling temporarily inactivate UNOS wait list 4 week post vaccination .</criteria>
