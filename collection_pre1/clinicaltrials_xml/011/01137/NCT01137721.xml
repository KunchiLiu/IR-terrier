	<brief_summary>Sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) serious blood disease blood vessel change lead brain injury stroke . Studies show 11 % patient SCA develop obvious stroke age 20 year , child le 10 year age especially vulnerable . The main objective SCDMR4 [ State Of The Art Functional Imaging In Sickle Cell Disease ] trial compare gray matter cerebral blood flow , measure MRI , [ magnetic resonance image ] ASL [ Arterial Spin Labeling ] perfusion treatment begin appropriate hydroxyurea dosage reach ( ~ one year ) . Other important objective SCDMR4 trial include describe effect hydroxyurea therapy transfusion therapy functional MRI response , diffusion tensor image white matter , brain function , transcranial Doppler blood velocity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Primary Objective study compare research participant 's GM [ Gray Matter ] CBF [ Cerebral Blood Flow ] ASL [ Arterial Spin Labeling ] technique reach stable hydroxyurea MTD [ Maximum Tolerated Dose ] ( 12±3 month start hydroxyurea ) . This observational study . Participants receive hydroxyurea part standard care treatment . This study observe measure prior begin hydroxyurea participant reach maximum tolerate dose order describe effect therapy participant ' functional response .</detailed_description>
