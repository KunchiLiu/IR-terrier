	<brief_summary>The purpose project : 1. determine incidence complex sleep apnea 2. determine percentage case resolve time therapy Continuous Positive Airway Pressure 3 . Determine whether difference outcome , persistent complex sleep apnea CPAP , treat CPAP adaptive servo-ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcome Treatment Complex Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suspect obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) study overnight sleep laboratory , part routine clinical management . If find OSA first half night , start continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) nasal mask part routine clinical management . A certain percentage patient ( best estimate literature 15 % ) develop central sleep apnea ( CSA ) treatment CPAP . Participants recruit patient treat Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea ( CSA ) CPAP , willing give inform consent . Patients treat `` best CPAP '' pressure , determine sleep physician reading sleep study . This define minimum pressure associate elimination obstructive event . Patients treat CPAP 12 week . Following treatment , patient bring back second sleep study assess CPAP . Those demonstrate resolution CSA sleep study continue CPAP additional 12 week . Those demonstrate persistent CSA randomize either `` best CPAP '' Adaptive Servo-ventilation ( ASV ) therapy additional 12 week . ASV titrate second sleep study determine optimal setting . Patients compare end 12 24 week treatment regard response therapy . This assessed compliance therapy ( monitored smart card within positive pressure machine ) , improvement sleepiness measure Epworth Sleepiness Score , change quality life measure Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) validate quality life instrument specific sleep apnea . In addition , demonstrate persistent central apnea 12 week CPAP therapy , randomize CPAP ASV , third final sleep study do assess residual apnea-hypopnea index ( number respiratory event divide number hour sleep ) therapy . In randomized CPAP persistent poor clinical response associate abnormal residual AHI 24 week treatment , 12 week trial ASV undertaken ass whether offer benefit . In addition assess effect treatment , original diagnostic polysomnogram patient complex sleep apnea analyze determine polysomnographic feature could utilize predict complex sleep apnea CPAP apply , ( example : 1 ) evidence mixed apnea ; 2 ) component central apneas addition predominant pattern OSA . )</detailed_description>
