	<brief_summary>WHAT IS THE STUDY PRODUCT ? The study product contraceptive patch , study drug patch . The patch apply directly skin contains Levonorgestrel ( LNG ) time-release form . LNG hormone test approve Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) form , example : contraceptive pill , intrauterine device ( IUDs , put uterus ( womb ) ) implant ( drug silicon tube place skin ) . The use LNG form contraceptive patch make experimental drug way drug absorb body new technique . This study drug contain estrogen protect HIV , AIDS , sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) . LNG progestin ( type drug like hormone . Progestins cause change open uterus ( womb ) , thicken cervical mucus ( fluid ) . This thickened cervical mucus make difficult male 's sperm reach fertilize woman 's egg . Since LNG absorb skin patch , experimental , unknown study product really prevent pregnancy like progestin . WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE ? The purpose study find : - How well patch prevents pregnancy - How safe patch use every day - How much study drug need patch make sure prevents pregnancy - How study drug patch affect cervical mucus ( fluid ) - How study drug patch affect rate ovulation ( often release egg ) - How well patch stick skin , without fall , week time - Whether patch cause skin irritation rash ( redness itchiness ) - Whether study drug patch affect everyday life cause side effect . WHAT DOES THE STUDY INVOLVE ? We expect approximately twenty ( 20 ) woman six ( 6 ) participate clinic study . In total , 120 woman United States study . This study compare effectiveness two different dos study drug ( 40ug 75 ug ) patch . This study open-label randomized trial , mean study doctor aware dosage study drug give . Randomization mean select chance , like toss coin roll dice . You 50 % chance group receive 40ug dose patch group receive 75ug dose patch .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II , multi-center , open-label , randomize , parallel group , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic study AG1000-6.5 AG1000-12.5 transdermal contraceptive delivery system ( TCDS ) healthy woman follow outpatient three 28-day cycle ( 12 week approximately 3 month ) . During study , subject receive active treatment LNG TCDS patch 11 week , follow one week post-treatment assessment . The TCDS design one week patch wear . This study conduct National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network ( CCTN ) 6 site USA enroll approximately 120 woman . This study enroll approximately 120 subject , randomize across site two treatment group ( ~60 subject dose level ) . The randomization schedule stratify ensure enrollment approximately 50 % subject BMI &gt; 32 kg/m2 &lt; 40 kg/m2 approximately 50 % subject BMI &lt; 32 kg/m2 dose level .</detailed_description>
