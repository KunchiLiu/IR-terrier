	<brief_title>Pomalidomide , Cyclophosphamide Prednisone ( PCP ) Patients With Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) Relapsed and/or Refractory Lenalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective multicenter phase I follow phase II trial design evaluate safety efficacy combination Pomalidomide Cyclophosphamide Prednisone patient multiple myeloma relapse and/or refractory lenalidomide . Patients evaluate scheduled visit 3 study period : pre-treatment , treatment long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) . The pre-treatment period include : screening visit , perform study entry . After provide write informed consent participate study , patient evaluate study eligibility . The screening period include evaluation inclusion criterion describe . Subjects meet inclusion criterion enrol . The treatment period include : administration salvage treatment PCP 6 cycle maintenance treatment . In order ass toxicity treatment , patient attend study centre visit least every 2 week , unless clinically indicate . The response assess cycle . During LTFU period , development confirm PD , patient follow survival every 1-3 month via telephone office visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year . Patient multiple myeloma receive 1 3 line treatment ( include highdose chemotherapy stem cell support , conventional polichemotherapy , thalidomide , bortezomib melphalanbased regimen ) relapse relapsed refractory ( mean relapse salvage progression within 60 day recent therapy ) lenalidomide therapy . Patient clinical relapse MM base standard criterion . Patient measurable disease , define follow : For secretory multiple myeloma , measurable disease define quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value ( great 1 g/dL IgG Mprotein , great 0.5 g/dL IgA Mprotein IgD Mprotein OR urine lightchain excretion 200 mg/24 hour ) For oligo nonsecretory multiple myeloma , measurable disease define presence measurable soft tissue ( bone ) plasmacytoma determine clinical examination applicable radiograph ( i.e. , MRI , CT scan ) . A measurable lesion define lesion minimum large diameter &gt; 20 mm ( measured conventional technique physical exam , conventional CT scan , MRI ) &gt; 10 mm ( measured spiral CT scan ) one dimension . Patient Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Pregnant breast feeding female . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study . Use concomitant standard/experimental antimyeloma drug therapy . Uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease include myocardial infarction within 6 month enrolment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , clinically significant pericardial disease , cardiac amyloidosis Other malignancy within past 5 year . Exceptions : basal cell non metastatic squamous cell carcinoma skin , cervical carcinoma situ FIGO Stage 1 carcinoma cervix . Concurrent medical condition disease ( e.g. , active systemic infection , uncontrolled diabetes , pulmonary disease , cardiac disease ) likely interfere study procedure result , opinion investigator would constitute hazard participate study .</criteria>
