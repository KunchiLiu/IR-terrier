	<brief_summary>Post herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) undertreated condition . It type neuropathic pain ( NP ) , pain caused abnormal activity sensory nerve . Its mechanism fully understood , medication trial PHN pain type NP frequently unsuccessful . There extensive investigation aim identify understand specific mechanism NP . While test inexpensive easy perform bedside , many require expensive tool highly equip laboratory facility . Further , standard method assessment pain NP patient . The investigator aim test Bedside Sensory Testing Kit ( assessment Neuropathic Pain ) small number patient PHN . The purpose Kit identify mechanism pain . The goal research design way classify patient PHN base mechanism cause pain , since may help predict best medication individual patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Bedside Pain Assessment Kit Postherpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize : ( ) Bedside Sensory Testing Kit PHN design work efficiently Subjects Investigators , tolerate well Subjects , statistically reliable Investigators ; ( b ) sensory test kit distinguish PHN patient different sensory quality pain may cause different underlie pain mechanism . The subject patient postherpetic neuralgia voluntarily participate meet eligibility criterion . The study participant complete brief questionnaire undergo three round BSTK , perform two study investigator . The item BSTK correspond series sensory assessment , aim contribute characterization individual ' PHN pain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject 40 85 year old . Physician documentation history postherpetic neuralgia must provide ; pain persist 3 months/90 day patient 's vesicular rash ( shingle ) heal . Subject able speak , read write English comply study procedure ; Subject willing voluntarily sign date Informed Consent Form , approve IRB , prior conduct studyspecific procedure ; Subject must willing abstain PRN ( need ) pain medicine 12 hour prior study may continue stand dos pain medicine . Subject pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Subjects additional source chronic pain allow severity pain additional location severe enough compromise assessment PHN pain . This leave Investigator 's discretion . Subject medical condition , PHN , wellcontrolled treatment ; subject clinically significant condition would , opinion investigator , preclude study participation , interfere assessment pain , pose unacceptable risk participant . Subject enrol another study within 30 day . Subject know contact allergy surgical skin marker . In judgment investigator , subject psychiatric psychological disorder would interfere completion study , confound study result , pose patient risk . Subject neuropathy nerve fiber disease PHN ( e.g. , diabetic peripheral neuropathy ) .</criteria>
