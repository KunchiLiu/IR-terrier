	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop new diagnostic method developmental disorder base behavior record interview subject medical staff well anonymous person . The behavior record video camera accompany non-invasive physiological recording , include electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , electromyogram ( EMG ) , body temperature use infrared ( IR ) thermograph . Thus , physiologically relevant disorder correlate behavior parameter could extract use new diagnostic marker . If necessary , medical staff may take blood sample subject interview . For longitudinal study , similar interview record subject plan evaluate effect medical educational intervention . The investigator also examine synergistic effect intervention administration supplement ( e.g. , vitamin D , arachidonic acid , coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ-10 ) ) . The clinician may use Risperidone .</brief_summary>
