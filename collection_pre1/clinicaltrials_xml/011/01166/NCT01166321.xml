	<brief_summary>Treatment standard patient atypical anaplastic meningioma neurosurgical resection . With approach , local control range 50 70 % , depend resection status . A series small study show postoperative radiotherapy patient population increase progression-free survival , translates increase overall survival . However , meningioma know radioresistant tumor , radiation dos 60 Gy high show necessary tumor control . Carbon ion offer physical biological characteristic . Due invert dose profile high local dose deposition within Bragg peak precise dose application spar normal tissue possible . Moreover , comparison photon , carbon ion offer increased relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) , calculate 2 5 depend cell line well endpoint analyze . First data obtain within Phase I/II trial perform GSI Darmstadt carbon ion radiotherapy patient high-risk meningioma show safety , treatment result promise . Therefore , current Phase II-MARCIE-Study carbon ion boost apply macroscopic tumor ( gross tumor volume , GTV ) conjunction photon radiotherapy clinical target volume ( CTV ) patient atypical meningioma incomplete resection biopsy . Primary endpoint progression-free survival rate , secondary endpoint overall survival , safety toxicity .</brief_summary>
