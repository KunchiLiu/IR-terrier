	<brief_summary>Zinc deficiency prevalent child develop country . Zinc-supplementation proven reduce duration severity childhood diarrhea randomize controlled trial . However , despite evidence , efficacy reduce diarrhea morbidity adult remain unknown . The main objective study determine efficacy Zn-supplementation diarrhea incidence vulnerable adult population . The study carry Kombewa division , Kisumu District involve 500 adult age 18-55 year . They randomly assign receive Zn supplement ( placebo ) daily basis 3 month period . Morbidity information collect daily 4 month , anthropometric measure laboratory data obtain study onset , end supplementation study conclusion . In addition , HIV malaria test carry study important confounders . The significant difference diarrhea incidence Zn-group placebo-group determine use SPSS . The result expect provide scientific basis common pathway development anti-diarrheal supplement vulnerable population environmental refugee , deprive displaced person , troop prior deployment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diarrhea major cause morbidity , hospitalization , loss duty day military personnel century . In fact , diarrheal illness common medical problem U.S. troop operational deployment . Soldiers especially prone diarrhea travel , consumption locally procure food ( include raw vegetable poorly-cooked meat product ) use nonpotable water , ice . High rate occurrence continue report soldier deployed recent conflict . Furthermore , high morbidity rate enteric disease report military force area current combat operation : 53 % -69 % Soviet troops major gastrointestinal infection Afghanistan war , 69 % British troop 36 % Australian troop report diarrhea Iraq Operation Safe Haven 1991 . The region sub-Saharan Africa , propose study would conduct , uniquely position anti-diarrheal research offer answer problem civilian population , displace person deploy soldier worker remote area . Diarrheal disease 4th leading cause out-patient morbidity Kenya , account almost 5 % new outpatient case , high prevalence Nyanza Province - 5.4 % 7.1 % total new case . Kisumu lie Nyanza Province western Kenya , border Lake Victoria populate Luo ethnic group . Nyanza one Kenya 's impoverished province one nation 's low immunization rate , high infant mortality high prevalence HIV ( 35 % among adults 15-49 year old 2000 , compare 14 % nationally ) . Malnutrition common ; endemic disease include malaria , leishmaniasis , tuberculosis schistosomiasis . Scientists Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) report specie bacterial pathogen isolate diarrhea patient Kisumu area : bacterial isolates similar report U.S. soldier ( 44 % Shigella ; 30 % Campylobacter ; 14 % Salmonella ) . However , isolates ( 51 % ) susceptible antimicrobial treatment . The study Brooks et al . ( 2003 ) , report 90 % isolates ( exclude Campylobacter ) resistant trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole tetracycline , 80 % resistant ampicillin . If alarm trend persists , drug-resistant bacteria identify civilian population , gain disease control strategy already deploy achieve , case deploy member military workforce , mission-impact may severely compromise . Thus , propose Kombewa Clinical Research Center ( KCRC ) , locate outside Kisumu , would allow test novel anti-diarrheal treatment , specifically dietary zinc ( Zn ) , antibiotic-resistant bacteria potential benefit deploy U.S. military western Kenyan population , also population Africa . Populations live Kombewa area serve potential study volunteer high prevalence antibiotic-resistant diarrhea adult region . This study build upon proven concept Zn-supplementation , adjunct oral rehydration , highly protective diarrhea child . The result expect provide scientific basis common pathway development commercially viable , multivalent , food-based , anti-diarrheal supplement vulnerable population troop prior deployment , deprive displaced person . Based successful outcome , would expect attract commercial support final micronutrient formulation suitable field use expand efficacy evaluation pivotal study support licensure . An anti-diarrheal product adult fill important military , refugee population need dual use civilian sector . The benefit maintain adequate zinc status population tropical area displace population refugee deploy soldier probably limit disease state discuss . Roles Zn describe important issue face soldier population tropic especially child , include cutaneous leishmaniasis , malaria , pneumonia , wound healing , cognitive function behavior , night vision . Because important role Zn maintain health fight disease , maintain adequate Zn level supplement Zn case , consider formulate diet resource deprive population , displace people modern deployed soldier . The primary objective study determine incidence diarrhea zinc vs. placebo-supplemented adult ; secondary objective include : determining time diarrhea onset group ; determine duration diarrhea episode group ; determine number loose stool per day per episode diarrhea group . Tertiary objective include determine nutritional status study population use anthropometric measurement micronutrient assay ; determine incidence malaria zinc vs. placebo-supplemented adult ; determine HIV infection confound factor outcome diarrhea incidence follow zinc supplementation adult . Hypotheses 1 . There statistically significant difference incidence diarrhea adult give Zn supplementation compare placebo three month period . We determine incidence diarrhea Zn placebo arm study . This accomplished self-reported incidence volunteer collect health worker field station subject 's home . 2 . The time diarrhea onset significantly different Zn supplement study arm compare placebo study arm . We determine number day study start ( two week period volunteer receive either Zn supplement placebo ) onset diarrhea Zn placebo arm study . This accomplished self-reported data volunteer collect health worker field station subject 's home . 3 . The duration diarrhea episode significantly different Zn-supplemented study arm compare placebo study arm . We determine number day diarrhea episode Zn placebo arm study . This accomplished self-reported data volunteer collect health worker field station subject 's home . 4 . The number loose stool per day per episode diarrhea significantly different Zn-supplemented study arm compare placebo study arm . We determine number number loose stool per day per episode diarrhea Zn placebo arm study . This accomplished self-reported data volunteer collect health worker field station subject 's home . 5 . The incidence malaria significantly different Zn vs. placebo-supplemented adult . We determine incidence malaria Zn placebo arm study . This accomplish use result malaria blood smear collect study .</detailed_description>
