	<brief_summary>Treatment patient recurrent glioma include neurosurgical resection , chemotherapy , radiation therapy . In case , full course radiotherapy apply primary diagnosis , therefore application re-irradiation apply cautiously . With modern precision photon technique fractionate stereotactic radiotherapy ( FSRT ) , second course radiotherapy safe effective lead survival time 22 , 16 8 month recurrent WHO grade II , III IV tumor . Carbon ion offer physical biological characteristic . Due invert dose profile high local dose deposition within Bragg peak precise dose application spar normal tissue possible . Moreover , comparison photon , carbon ion offer increase relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) , calculate 2 5 depend Glioblastoma ( GBM ) cell line well endpoint analyze . Protons , however , offer RBE comparable photon . First Japanese Data evaluation carbon ion radiation therapy treatment primary high-grade glioma show promising result small heterogeneous patient collective . In current Phase I/II-CINDERELLA-trial re-irradiation use carbon ion compare FSRT apply area contrast enhancement represent high-grade tumor area patient recurrent glioma . Within Phase I Part trial , Recommended Dose ( RD ) carbon ion radiotherapy determine dose escalation scheme . In subsequent randomized Phase II part , RD evaluate experimental arm , compare standard arm , FSRT total dose 36 Gy single dose 2 Gy . Primary endpoint Phase I part toxicity . Primary endpoint randomize part II survival re-irradiation 12 month , secondary endpoint progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
