	<criteria>Patients infected HIV1 , document positive HIV1 antibody test and/or positive PCR confirm HIV1 RNA . Patients triple antiretroviral therapy boost protease inhibitor . Patients undetectable viral load , define &lt; 50 viral RNA copies/mL within last six month . Men woman agedâ‰¥18 . For woman childbearing potential , negative urine pregnancy test Screening visit . Patients would grant write informed consent prior Studyspecific screen procedure . Patients write proof resistance accumulate genotype , would lead sensibility loss lopinavir/ritonavir , , case genotype absence , documented failure protease inhibitor therapy . Patients CD4 cell nadir CD4 &lt; 100 cell/microL . Patients , reason , could treat lopinavir/ritonavir . Prior medical history psychiatric disorder , depressive syndrome , schizophrenia psychotic disease . Known previous medical history drug abuse/addiction alcohol chronic consumption , Investigator 's opinion , would incompatible his/her Study participation . Pregnant breastfeed woman , woman childbearing potential use appropriate contraceptive method , accord Investigator 's opinion . Documented past ( within four week prior screen ) active current opportunistic infection . Patients , due severe toxicity relate current HAART compound , plan discontinuation modification concern drug triple therapy .
