	<brief_title>Temsirolimus/AZD 6244 Treatment-naive With BRAF Mutant Unresectable Stage IV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical response rate ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] ) one-year overall survival study drug temsirolimus AZD6244 ( selumetinib ) hydrogen sulfate BRAF V600E mutant unresectable stage IV melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate 6-month progression-free survival patient receive temsirolimus AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate . II . Determine pharmacodynamic effect temsirolimus AZD6244 pERK , s6K , PTEN mediator apoptosis . III . Determine toxicity profile temsirolimus AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate . OUTLINE : Treatment Phase : This period begin first intravenous ( vein ) infusion TEMSIROLIMUS first AZD6244 administration mouth ( visit 2 , Week 1 ) continue Week 8 ( Visit 4 ) . As many 38 patient receive dosage TEMSIROLIMUS inject vein week 8 week , AZD6244 give capsule mouth twice day 8 week . That one cycle . The TEMSIROLIMUS AZD6244 give participant outpatient , unless admission hospital need treatment related side effect underlying disease . The subsequent cycle TEMSIROLIMUS AZD6244 give every 8 week . The TEMSIROLIMUS inject vein 30 minute . The continuation phase begin visit week 12 patient receive least two cycle treatment .</detailed_description>
