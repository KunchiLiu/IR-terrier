	<brief_summary>This Phase 1/2 , open-label , monocentric , dose-escalation study lenalidomide combination cetuximab subject solid tumor . The primary objective establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combination cetuximab patient solid tumor include colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Cetuximab Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : For metastatic cancer head neck , lung colorectal cancer , standard therapy comprise chemotherapy regimen partially combination monoclonal antibody block vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . When disease progression occur treatment option apply , establish therapy available clinical development new strategy warrant . Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) thalidomide derivative belongs so-called ImiDs , class immunostimulatory molecule . IMiDs profound effect immune system . Obviously , IMiDs able function co-stimulatory molecule mature T cell . In addition , IMiDs able mitigate negative effect CTLA-4 signalling . On molecular level , IMiDs induce phosphorylation CD28 , underline concept act costimulatory signal T cell activation . Furthermore , induction specific CTL responses dendritic cell ( DC ) enhance activity suppressive regulatory T cell ( Treg ) inhibit . In addition effect cell adaptive immune system , IMiDs also target innate immune response . Natural killer cell ( NK ) well natural killer T-cells ( NKT ) activate Immunomodulatory Drugs ( IMiDs ) , effect IMiDs NK NKT cell might contribute immune-activating property ImiDs . Therefore rationale combination lenalidomide therapeutic IgG1 antibody cetuximab ( Erbitux® ) base fact several report suggest role antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) mode action cetuximab . However , exact definition anti-cancer mechanism lenalidomide alone combination cetuximab vivo require investigation early clinical trial . The goal phase I/II trial define toxicity combination lenalidomide cetuximab study potential effect tumor immune system . Subjects meet inclusion criterion enrol cohort three patient receive single , oral dose lenalidomide administer Days 1-28 intravenous ( IV ) infusion cetuximab ( 400 mg/m2 first infusion , 250 mg/m2 subsequently ) administer Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Prior combination therapy , 21 day lead treatment period lenalidomide monotherapy ( Days -21 -1 ) . Combination treatment start Day 1 . Tumor biopsy take monotherapy lenalidomide treatment ( d-25 -22 ) Day -3 -1 ( start cetuximab ) . A third tumor biopsy take Cycle 1 Day 21 28 start combination therapy . Cycles repeat every 28 day . All subject continue study drug disease progression , unacceptable toxicity treatment discontinuation reason . The MTD lenalidomide define high dose level 1 6 subject experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) first cycle administration combination cetuximab . Safety measurement analysis perform visit .</detailed_description>
