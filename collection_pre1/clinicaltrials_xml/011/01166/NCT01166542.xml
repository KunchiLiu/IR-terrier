	<brief_title>Efficacy Study REOLYSIN® Combination With Paclitaxel Carboplatin Platinum-Refractory Head Neck Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous cell carcinoma head neck sixth common cancer world . More 50 % patient diagnose advanced regional disease relapse locally distant site . Initial therapeutic option include irradiation , surgery chemotherapy . The commonly used agent cisplatin carboplatin , generally combination 5-FU taxane . Erbitux approve use first-line radiation second-line monotherapy . Only third patient respond first-line platinum-based therapy median overall survival 6-9 month . Preliminary assessment Phase 1-2 study conduct UK investigate combination REOLYSIN , carboplatin paclitaxel suggest patient head neck carcinoma may represent group patient treatment combination active . Studies also show paclitaxel carboplatin combination therapy may effective head neck cancer , even heavily pretreated patient resistant previous treatment . These result strongly support utility carboplatin/paclitaxel combination control arm salvage therapy platinum refractory patient , patient group poor treatment option gold standard therapy . This Phase 3 study design compare response rate follow intravenous administration REOLYSIN ( Reovirus Type 3 Dearing ) combination paclitaxel carboplatin versus chemotherapy treatment alone , patient metastatic recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck . Overall survival primary endpoint trial . Patients clinically evaluated course treatment radiologically every 6 week treatment . The safety paclitaxel carboplatin intravenous blind placebo intravenous blind REOLYSIN also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Each patient MUST : recurrent metastatic ( R/M ) histologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) head neck ( oropharynx , oral cavity , larynx , hypopharynx ) squamous cell nasopharynx cancer ( NPC ) distal metastasis ( e ) secondary cancer ( Patients NPC without distal metastasis ( e ) undifferentiated NPC eligible ) . least one lesion measurable compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ( Lesions persist previously treat radiation field consider evaluable response except represent relapse mucosal nodal lesion previously demonstrate complete response . Any new lesion within previous radiation field acceptable determination response and/or progression ) . complete first line chemotherapy R/M SCCHN progress within 190 day follow completion platinum platinumbased chemotherapy . continue acute toxic effect ( except alopecia ) prior radiotherapy , chemotherapy , surgical procedure . Any surgery involve SCC patient treat ( except biopsy ) must occur least 28 day prior study enrollment . receive chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy hormonal therapy within 28 day . ECOG Performance Score ≤ 2. life expectancy least 3 month . absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L ; platelet ≥100 x 10^9/L ] ; hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL ; serum creatinine ≤1.5 xULN ; bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ; AST/ALT ≤2.5 x ULN . negative pregnancy test female childbearing potential . Be wiling able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test . No patient may : receive concurrent therapy investigational anticancer agent study . treat taxane SCCHN . current history brain metastasis poor prognosis frequent development progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . chronic immunosuppressive therapy know HIV infection active hepatitis B C. pregnant breastfeed woman . Female patient childbearing potential must agree use effective contraception , surgically sterile , postmenopausal . Male patient must agree use effective contraception surgically sterile . Barrier method recommend form contraception . clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association , Class III IV ) include , limited , preexist arrhythmia , uncontrolled angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 1 year prior study entry . dementia alter mental status would prohibit informed consent . acute , chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Principal Investigator , would make patient inappropriate study .</criteria>
