	<brief_title>A Research Study Looking Specific Tissue Umbilical Cord</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our work hypothesis umbilical cord blood Wharton 's Jelly matrix biochemical biomechanical characteristic need ideal scaffold tissue engineering . Accordingly , expect matrix support growth differentiation transplant mesenchymal stem cell . The first step effort isolate Wharton 's Jelly matrix decellularization . The second step test ability matrix support growth differentiation transplant mesenchymal stem cell . The third step pursue preliminary animal test study ability matrix support bone tissue regeneration vivo .</detailed_description>
