	<brief_summary>Port wine stain , also call nevus flammeus , congenital , cutaneous vascular malformation involve post-capillary venule produce light pink red dark-red-violet discoloration skin . It estimate Port wine stain occur 3 child per 1,000 live birth . Approximately 900,000 individual United States twenty million people worldwide Port wine stain birthmark .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Use Matrix Radiofrequencyfor Treatment Port Wine Stain Birthmarks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study improve port wine stain treatment Matrix Radiofrequency device treatment . The Matrix Radiofrequency device energy generates fractional deep dermal heat region electrode matrix induce skin injury , thus elicit wound heal response . Less affected tissue surround matrix point may stimulate heat help accelerate healing process , time minimize adverse effect scar change normal skin pigmentation . The researcher determine Port wine stain area treat Matrix Radiofrequency device improve Port wine stain blanching response compare area treat pulsed dye laser .</detailed_description>
