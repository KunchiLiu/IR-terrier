	<brief_summary>Women invite participate E-OPTIMAL last clinical follow-up visit OPTIMAL ( 24 month post surgery ) . E-OPTIMAL extension ongoing OPTIMAL study new study treatment intervention give . Rather enrollment intervention investigate potential E-OPTIMAL participant randomly assign watch standardize video prior consent undergo standard inform consent process . The standardized video review rationale woman 's health research , importance long-term follow-up detailed invitation participate E-OPTIMAL . The video undergone review potential subject , coordinator physician researcher ensure relevance importance issue potentially impact long-term participation study E-OPTIMAL cover . Participation E-OPTIMAL occur three additional year . Women strongly encourage participate annual examination annual telephone survey may participate one study part need . We propose test follow null hypothesis : 1 . There difference time surgical failure uterosacral vaginal vault ligament suspension ( ULS ) sacrospinous ligament fixation ( SSLF ) 5 year surgery . 2 . The addition standardize video detail importance long-term follow-up study POP inform consent process improve enrollment retention E-OPTIMAL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal long-term follow-up study extend follow-up woman OPTIMAL study 5 year time surgery compare success complication rate two surgical treatment group extend time period . The Operations Pelvic Muscle Training Management Apical Support Loss ( OPTIMAL ) study randomize trial design compare sacrospinous ligament fixation ( SSLF ) uterosacral vaginal vault ligament suspension ( ULS ) ass role perioperative behavioral therapy/pelvic muscle training ( PMT ) woman undergo vaginal surgery apical uterine prolapse stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) . The OPTIMAL study include two-year follow time surgery , short evaluate long-term sequelae surgical procedure . A goal E-OPTIMAL investigate strategy improve enrollment retention long-term study woman undergo surgery pelvic organ prolapse SUI , randomize subject two different recruitment method . The primary aim extension study compare SSLF ULS follow outcomes 5 year surgery woman Stage 2-4 prolapse involve vaginal apex uterus stress urinary incontinence : 1. time surgical failure ; 2. long-term functional health-related quality life ( QOL ) , adjust PMT treatment group ; 3. annual cumulative incidence , resolution , persistence pelvic floor symptom ( urinary , bowel , prolapse ) , adjust PMT treatment group . An additional primary aim ( aim 4 ) determine whether exposure standardize video detail importance long-term follow-up study pelvic organ prolapse prior informed consent process improve enrollment and/or retention E-OPTIMAL . We utilize conceptual framework ass three concept ( motivation , barrier pragmatic issue ) two level ( study level personal/individual level ) . This conceptual framework develop follow review scant available literature topic , well discussion investigator experience recruit retain participant pelvic floor disorder study .</detailed_description>

Note : Subjects unable return annual visit exclude participate telephone interview . However , every attempt make encourage inperson participation . Criteria termination participation : ( Due evidence likelihood subject longer consent ) 1 . Subjects 75 year old fail telephone minimental status examination . If participant get 5 10 item `` incorrect '' interviewer say `` thank much time , complete interview today . '' In word , interviewer way implies participant `` pas '' test continue . The interviewer contact appropriate site coordinator immediately interview let know outcome . 2 . Subjects young 75 appear cognitive deficit quality life telephone interview administer minimental status examination ; fail exclude participation . ( Proxy respondent use . ) Subjects appear cognitive deficit inperson visit site telephone interview withdrawn study study coordinator . 3 . Subjects become longterm resident skilled nursing facility . 4 . Withdrawal consent . Verbal assent obtain prior telephone interview inperson visit . Note : Subjects unable complete telephone interview ( example , hear loss ) may complete interview portion survey person , either site home .</criteria>
