	<brief_summary>The researcher want explore genetic cause muscle disease . The researcher particularly interested muscle disorder occur combination disease bone appear pass generation generation . Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy measure concentration blood , water , lipid ( fat , example ) tissue . This device essentially measure color tissue order determine tissue physiology ( physical chemical process ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy , technique fast painless develop University California , Irvine . The Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy instrument actively involve research study , yet part routine clinical practice . The result study aid similar research project seek improve understand tissue work alteration metabolism affect long-term health . TheDiffuse Optical Spectroscopy measurement consist place probe onto surface body ( calf , bicep , head ) . This probe secure either gentle hand pressure fasten skin use clinically-approved wrap Coban/wrap bandage medical adhesive tape medical glue . Several dot make skin outline probe surgical felt tip marker . This would able put probe spot case need interrupt measurement . The probe look like bar code scanner supermarket shine infrared light skin . There radiation involve light . In case light signal low , optical detector place directly onto skin ( contain within electronically shield casing , place inside another plastic casing ) . ( offered pregnancy ) .</detailed_description>
