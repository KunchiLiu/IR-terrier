	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence prevalent condition markedly impact quality life disproportionately affect woman . Overactive Bladder syndrome ( OAB ) define symptoms urgency frequency urge urinary incontinence ( OAB-wet ) without urge incontinence ( OAB-dry ) . Conservative first line treatment urge incontinence combine OAB symptom ( OAB-wet ) include behavioral therapy , pelvic floor train +/- biofeedback , use anticholinergic medication . These treatment modality may result total continence often drug therapy discontinue lack efficacy , side effect cost want take pill . Behavioral therapy pelvic muscle exercise require consistent , active intervention patient often sustain . Thus , objective Anticholinergic v Botox Comparison Study ( ABC ) determine whether single intra-detrusor injection botulinum toxin A ( Botox A® ) effective standardized regimen oral anticholinergic reduce urge urinary incontinence . The null hypothesis difference change baseline average number urge urinary incontinence episodes 6 month group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anticholinergic vs. Botox Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 6-month double-blind randomize trial compare intra-detrusor botulinum toxin A ( Botox A® ) anticholinergic therapy woman without neurologic disease urge incontinence . Subjects follow additional six month study drug determine duration treatment effect . The primary aim compare change urge incontinence episodes 6 month woman receive single intra-detrusor injection 100 unit botulinum toxin A ( Botox A® ) plus daily oral placebo tablet versus woman receive single intra-detrusor injection saline plus daily anticholinergic therapy .</detailed_description>
