	<brief_summary>Celiac plexus neurolysis ( CPN ) perform nearly 100 year alleviate abdominal pain associate pancreatic malignancy condition , usually undertaken late stage disease process , analgesic option largely exhaust led significant often unacceptable side effect . Until recently , CPN commonly perform radiographic guidance ; however , last 10 year , CPN routinely perform endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) guidance . Several case series demonstrate efficacy safety technique use treat pain associate pancreatic malignancy and/or chronic pancreatitis . However , efficacy EUS-guided CPN treatment pain related non-pancreatic malignancy yet describe . The goal study assess efficacy EUS-guided CPN management pain patient abdominal non-pancreatic malignancy . Our hypothesis EUS-guided CPN provide adequate pain relief patient .</brief_summary>
