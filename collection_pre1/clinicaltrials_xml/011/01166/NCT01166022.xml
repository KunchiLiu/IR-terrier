	<brief_summary>This study conduct test whether exercise effectively use intervention treat Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) . In order answer question , investigator enroll 14 subject SMA age 8 50 ask complete 18 month training schedule . At point subject ask closely follow specific train regimen point may ask exercise manner normally . The exercise ask perform include bike stationary cycle lift hand weight . Subjects ask come clinic seven time course study perform test . These test include motor function measure , physical exam , questionnaire , exercise capacity test involve rid stationary bicycle , test subject ask walk far six minute .
