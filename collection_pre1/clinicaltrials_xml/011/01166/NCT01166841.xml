	<brief_summary>The use minimally invasive cardiac surgery progress last 5-10 year allow access heart small incision right chest . This avoids use sternotomy incision bone front chest . The benefit approach cosmetic ( small incision easily visible ) faster recovery . The minimally invasive approach also eliminate risk sternal wound infection . Minimally invasive cardiac surgery however pose additional challenge ; one big access large blood vessel need cannulate allow heart lung machine function . In conventional surgery , vessel easily access enter leave heart . In minimally invasive surgery , cannula place easily accessible artery vein , traditionally femoral vessel . These vessel small heart require small cannula , provide challenge heart lung machine . One way around use cannulae cannulation vein neck also perform . This cannula however , associate neck hematoma , tear vein blood loss . While placement cannula neck routine LHSC , surgery first perform 10 year ago , do without neck cannula injury patient . The purpose study therefore , rigorously study effect neck cannula heart lung bypass , specifically see oxygen delivery organ , brain particular sufficient avoid hypoxia .</brief_summary>
