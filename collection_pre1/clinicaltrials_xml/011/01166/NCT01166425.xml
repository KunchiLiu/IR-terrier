In order examine treatment bipolar disorder lithium , study include four phase treatment . The first phase , Efficacy Phase , include participant randomize either lithium placebo 8 week determine efficacy lithium treatment child adolescents bipolar I disorder . Once participant complete Efficacy Phase , participant may eligible continue Long- Term Effectiveness Phase maximum 24 week lithium treatment . Subsequently , participant meet response criterion Long-Term Effectiveness Phase eligible continue Discontinuation Phase . During Discontinuation Phase , participant randomize either placebo lithium treatment 28 week . Finally , participant experience mood relapse Discontinuation Phase enrol Open Label Restabilization Phase treat lithium 8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The follow objective study : 1 . To determine lithium efficacious reduce symptom mania placebo . 2 . To describe short-term safety lithium pediatric population relative placebo treatment . 3 . To examine effectiveness efficacy lithium maintenance treatment child adolescents bipolar I disorder . 4 . To examine long-term short-term safety tolerability lithium pediatric bipolar I disorder . 5 . To examine effect lithium treatment time specific aspect cognitive functioning report adversely affected lithium adult population . 6 . More specifically , determine integrity fine-motor , attention , verbal memory , select executive function domains prior treatment baseline , end week 8/early termination Efficacy Phase , end week 24/early termination Long- Term Effectiveness Phase ( 24/32 week lithium treatment ) . 7 . To examine relationship systemic exposure lithium effectiveness toxicity . 8 . To examine long-term safety tolerability combination therapy , lithium plus psychotropic agent , pediatric bipolar I disorder . 9 . To critically assess efficacy lithium prophylaxis recurrence mood symptom child adolescent . 10 . In participant discontinue treatment lithium experience mood relapse , determine duration lithium treatment necessary re-stabilization achieve . 11 . To evaluate influence intrinsic factor [ e.g . age , gender , race , renal function , height , ( measure stadiometer ) weight ] lithium exposure . The Study population study : Children adolescent 7- 17 year age meet DSM-IV diagnostic criterion Bipolar I ( mania , mixed mania ) without psychotic symptom determine child adolescent psychiatrist eligible study .</detailed_description>

Participants must meet DSMIV diagnostic criterion , assess semistructured assessment ( KSADSPL ) separate clinical interview child/adolescent psychiatrist manic mixed episode bipolar I disorder 3 . Score &gt; 20 YMRS screen baseline 4 . The participant legal guardian must understand nature study able comply protocol requirement . The legal guardian must give write informed consent youth , write assent 5 . Participants comorbid condition [ attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , conduct disorder ] , except list Exclusion Criterion 2 , may participate 6 . If female : premenarchal , incapable pregnancy hysterectomy , tubal ligation , spousal/partner sterility . If sexually active capable pregnancy , use acceptable method contraception ( hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , spermicide barrier ) least one month prior study entry agrees continue use one duration study . If sexually abstinent capable pregnancy , agree continued abstinence use acceptable method birth control sexual activity commence 7 . Has negative quantitative serum ÃŸhuman chorionic gonadotrophin hormone pregnancy test screen negative qualitative urine pregnancy test baseline , female 8 . Participants history substance abuse may participate agree continue abstain drug trial negative drug screen screen prior baseline . Those initial positive drug screen screen may another screen do 13 week later screen , negative result allow participant participate 9 . The participant willing clinically able wash exclusion medication screen period . Prior administration lithium , participant use follow medication : antipsychotic , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , antidepressant within precede 2 week ; stimulant within precede week ; fluoxetine depot antipsychotic past month ( stable participant ask discontinue medication ) 10 . ECG bloodwork include CBC , electrolytes , etc . ( per Safety assessment procedure list Table 6 ) show clinically significant abnormality 1 . Participant clinically stable current medication regimen bipolar disorder 2 . A current lifetime diagnosis Schizophrenia Schizoaffective Disorder , Pervasive Developmental Disorder ( ASQ score &gt; 15 ) , Anorexia Nervosa , Bulimia Nervosa , ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder 3 . Current DSMIV diagnosis Substance Dependence 4 . Positive drug screen screen retest 13 week later 5 . Participants symptom mania may attributable general medical condition , secondary use medication ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) 6 . Evidence serious , unstable neurological illness treatment auspex study would contraindicate 7 . Any serious , unstable medical illness clinically significant abnormal laboratory assessment would adversely impact scientific interpretability unduly increase risk protocol 8 . Current general medical condition include neurological disease , diabetes mellitus , thyroid dysfunction , renal dysfunction might affect adversely lithium , could influence efficacy safety lithium , would complicate interpretation study result 9 . Evidence current serious homicidal/suicidal ideation treat physician 's opinion would appropriately safe participant participate study 10 . Evidence current active hallucination delusion treat physician 's opinion would appropriately safe participant participate study 11 . Concomitant prescription overthecounter medication nutritional supplement ( e.g. , ibuprofen , naproxen , St John 's wort ) would interact lithium affect participant 's physical mental status 12 . Concomitant psychotherapy treatment provide outside study initiate within 4 week prior screen 13 . Previous adequate trial Li+ ( least 4 week Li+ serum level 0.81.2 mEq/L ) 14 . History allergy lithium lithium intolerance 15 . Psychiatric hospitalization within 1 month screen psychosis serious homicidal/serious suicidal ideation 16 . Clinician 's judgment participant likely able complete study outpatient due psychiatric reason 17 . Females currently pregnant lactate 18 . Sexually active female , investigator ' opinion , use adequate form birth control . 19 . Participants unable swallow study medication 20 . Participants baseline YMRS score &lt; 20 anticipated 21 .
