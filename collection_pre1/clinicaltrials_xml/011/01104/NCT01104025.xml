	<brief_summary>Despite good progress last decade , hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) remain difficult treat . Two different treatment regimen use successfully . The first one , treatment regimen base two drug call etoposide dexamethasone , use worldwide . The second regimen , base two drug call Anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) prednisone , use mostly one hospital Paris , 15 year . With either regimen , three quarter treat child survive difficult time , first two month diagnosis . These two different regimen appear work somewhat differently , suspect combining may give good result either regimen alone . We conduct clinical trial test combination ATG , dexamethasone , etoposide treatment HLH . The purpose research study find effect ( good bad ) drug combination HLH .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hybrid Immunotherapy Hemophagocytic LymphoHistiocytosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) rare immunological disorder first recognize almost 70 year ago . ( 1 ) Genetic animal study indicate familial form HLH clearly due deficiency cytotoxic kill . Patients HLH present potentially fatal syndrome 'hyperimmunity . ' These patient severe inflammation , associate cytopenia variably severe bone marrow , liver , CNS damage . Tissue damage mortality appear due hypercytokinemia relate persistent immune hyperactivation . An animal model HLH correlative human study suggest excessive abnormal activation T cell drive pathophysiology disorder , suppress excessive activation critical successful therapy HLH . It believe combination two proven induction regimens hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH ) ( anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) - etoposide-based ) result response rate overall survival rate eight week comparable well current standard care ( induction therapy per HLH-94 protocol ) .</detailed_description>
