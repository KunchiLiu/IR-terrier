	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether trastuzumab lapatinib ditosylate effective treat woman early breast cancer . Update June 2013 : Since initial development EPHOS-B 2007 evidence relation safety efficacy anti-HER2 therapy available , particular , grow body evidence combination two anti-HER2 therapy effective monotherapies . Therefore study amend ( PART 2 ) 1:1:2 ratio control , perioperative trastuzumab combination lapatinib trastuzumab . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study trastuzumab see well work compare lapatinib ditosylate ( since June 2013 - Part 2 - compare combination lapatinib trastuzumab ) treat woman early breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether pre-operative treatment HER-2 positive breast cancer patient anti-HER2 therapy consist trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) v lapatinib ditosylate inhibits proliferation increase apoptosis . - To compare effect trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) , lapatinib ditosylate combination lapatinib ditosylate trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) inhibition proliferation increase apoptosis Secondary - To determine whether pre-operative anti-HER2 treatment reduces serum angiogenic factor . - To identify molecular predictor biological response anti-HER2 therapy OUTLINE : This multicenter study.Patients stratify accord center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . PART 1 : From Protocol version 1 4 : - Arm I ( control ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy . Approximately 14 day randomization , patient undergo either breast-conservation surgery mastectomy . - Arm II ( trastuzumab [ Herceptin® ] ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab IV 90 minute day 1 8 . Approximately 11 day begin neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo either breast-conservation surgery mastectomy , receive adjuvant trastuzumab day 15 . - Arm III ( lapatinib ditosylate ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-11 . Within 24 hour completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo either breast-conservation surgery mastectomy , receive adjuvant lapatinib ditosylate daily day 12-28 . Patients also receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy , include endocrine therapy ( hormone-sensitive disease ) and/or chemotherapy radiotherapy . PART 2 : From Protocol Version 5 ( June 2013 ) - Arm I ( control ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy . Approximately 14 day randomization , patient undergo either breast-conservation surgery mastectomy . - Arm II ( trastuzumab [ Herceptin® ] ) : Patients receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab IV 90 minute day 1 8 . Approximately 11 day begin neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo either breast-conservation surgery mastectomy , receive adjuvant trastuzumab day 15 . - Arm III ( lapatinib ditosylate ( trastuzumab [ Herceptin® ] combination ) : Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-11 . Within 24 hour completion neoadjuvant therapy , patient undergo either breast-conservation surgery mastectomy , receive adjuvant lapatinib ditosylate daily day 12-28 . Patients also receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab IV 90 minute day 1 8 receive adjuvant trastuzumab day 15 . PART 1 2 : Patients also receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy , include endocrine therapy ( hormone-sensitive disease ) and/or chemotherapy radiotherapy . All patient undergo blood tissue sample collection periodically biomarker research study comprise biomarkers proliferation , apoptosis , angiogenesis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 10 year . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK</detailed_description>
