	<detailed_description>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) cystic pancreatic neoplasm precursor invasive pancreatic cancer . Differentiating whether IPMN lesion benign malignant critical , prognosis management differs drastically , vary surgical resection observation . However , despite attempt characterize feature concern malignancy , difficult determine likelihood malignancy conventional imaging technique , include CT , MRI , EUS . An accurate , non-invasive test identify malignant IPMN need . The investigator ' hypothesis [ 18F ] -FDG PET may superior modality differentiate benign malignant IPMN lesion . We plan prospective pilot study ten consecutive patient IPMN Columbia University Pancreas Center undergo surgical resection disease . These patient undergo [ 18F ] -FDG PET imaging , well CT , MRI , EUS clinically indicate . All scan review two experienced nuclear medicine radiologist blind clinical characteristic study patient reach consensus . Areas focally increase [ 18F ] -FDG intake identify . Side-by-side reading CT scan perform evaluate whether increase [ 18F ] -FDG uptake corresponds pancreatic lesion . Mean maximal standardize uptake value ( SUV ) value , well differences intensity region interest remain pancreas , calculated.Surgical pathology utilized gold standard histological determination . Standard post-operative histological interpretation IPMN lesion record , include size , duct involvement ( main , side , mixed ) , ductal dilatation , lesion location ( head , neck , body , tail ) , histologic grade ( adenoma , borderline , carcinoma situ , invasive carcinoma ) . In addition , associate pancreatitis non-IPMN neoplastic change also note . Using PET scan result surgical pathology information , evaluate positive negative predictive value [ 18F ] -FDG PET malignancy within IPMN lesion .</detailed_description>
