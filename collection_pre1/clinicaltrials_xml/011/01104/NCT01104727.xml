	<detailed_description>Duration project Patients recruit study September 2010 September 2012 participate center . All randomize patient follow ( recovery ) outpatient clinic appointment 30 60 day surgery . A long-term evaluation do 12 month surgery . The last 3 month use photographic analysis cosmetic result , statistical analysis reporting data . Hypothesis /Aims SPA technique feasible approach peritoneal cavity . While perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy single umbilical access overall morbidity comparable multiport laparoscopy ( equivalence study ) entail reduced skin-incision 's related morbidity rate , reduce post-operative pain allow well cosmetic result . Other consider parameter ( operative time , conversion rate hospital stay ) suppose unchanged . Background More recently Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) highlight attention lay literature medium , first clinical report . Concept feasibility test animal experiment since 20041 , lead creation new scientific society committee declare aim regulate research activity , sponsorships register , without reach goal completely . After less three year , race first cholecystectomy NOTES condition human course . Since , many author report various case collection , many others present consistent research activity vitro vivo , look evident two different branch research defined2 . The first consist would call Endoscopical Access Natural Orifice Surgery ( EA-NOS ) include procedure truly perform natural orifice , goal design new platform surgery bring within human body recreate surgical condition safety . The evident difficulty obtain environment guaranteed ease use , safety efficacy , reduce mere research activity interest field , clinical application describe consist hybrid procedure , i.e . procedure perform basically laparoscopic condition help flexible instrument inserted natural orifice . In fact , recent large metanalysis NOTES literature3 focus various surgical intra-abdominal procedure , ascribable EA-NOS , conclude human study find satisfactory inclusion criterion , scarce disposable evidence , minor safety efficacy compare laparotomic laparoscopic alternative . The recommendation human procedure first pas hybrid NOTES surgery , strict guideline , apposite control register later support , know , revision NOSCAR `` white paper '' 4 . In fact , discussion need worldwide register , standardization nomenclature , safety data use ethical committee order authorize human trial , implementation interface medical society , industry regulatory office . In field , behalf EURONOTES Foundation , promote european registry NOTES procedure ( www.euronotes.world.it ) preliminary result await . The cool enthusiasm relate EA-NOS procedure naturally force surgeon concentrate technique could easily reproduce clinical environment . This brought interest towards would call Surgical Access Natural Orifice Surgery ( SA-NOS ) 2 . In fact , analysis literature would unveil vast majority human study ascribe SA-NOS . A wider vision consider SA-NOS approach , include group transvaginal , thoroughly described literature , also trans-umbilical surgery . Although approaches advantage burden problem related endoscopic defect 's closure term infection , safety , consistent technological research time-consumption , discussion trans-umbilical technique encounter appreciation among surgeon . We observe rapid clinical diffusion drive technology development support different major surgical company . Thus , say single-port laparoscopic surgery nothing new . It 1992 Marco Pelosi first describe laparoscopic appendectomy use single umbilical puncture5 . Even multi-port single-incision trans-umbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy first describe Giuseppe Navarra already 19977 . Despite , interest towards single-port surgery grew-up recently . This might one side explain well establishment laparoscopic technique skill year , rise doubt possible industry driven interest . There discussion technique number drawback . The major one regard concept `` triangulation '' laparoscopic surgeon grow accustomed term instrument scope , lack . Although seem overshadowed increase acceptability in-line viewing , say industry concentrate develop marketing number curve instrument different characteristic aim restore standard triangulation laparoscopic environment . Nevertheless , personal experience gain conduce trial virtual reality simulator design purpose , demonstrate experienced surgeon perform surgical task safety effectiveness require short learn curve , surgeon technique acquisition challenging7 . Still number different concern arise . The fundamental hypothesis base single-port grow interest could improve cosmesis , decrease post-operative pain therefore probably allow early return work case well patient 's satisfaction . None confirm yet , ever . It also clear advocate patient ' preference main reason propose single-port technique forget patient ' preference deeply influenced assumption argument favor single-port surgery correct , despite realistic certainty . Some major expert field minimally invasive surgery active researcher field NOTES share skeptical opinion real benefit single port technique application . Dr Ratner instance state recent interview `` ... clear whether single port laparoscopy would beneficial compare traditional laparoscopy '' 8 . In case never advocate even slightly improve cosmetic value safety , principal concern . This implication intraoperative postoperative time . While recommended consider conversion standard multi-trocars laparoscopy failure , might , happen begin diffusion laparoscopy , increase number complication observe . In fact , often similar circumstance , minority effort dedicate train program simulator available yet . Moreover , advocate large peri-umbilical incision consequent fascial defect would imply high rate incisional hernia . Although likely happen , time data acquire give u answer . For reason robust study show indeed difference without significant compromise safety await wide diffusion technique . In propose study cholecystectomy choose target represent typical diffuse indication laparoscopy . Its morbidity rate relate skin incision occur range 1 5 % 9,10 .

Surg Endosc ( 2008 ) DOI 10.1007/s00464-008-0252-y Study Design Design : multi-centric randomized control trial ( RCT ) Primary endpoint : Overall morbidity rate define diagnose morbidity related surgical technique within 60 day surgery . Primary outcome measure ( non-inferiority ) : Morbidity , define occurrence complication , directly indirectly relate surgery . Complications classify accord Dindo [ Dindo D. , Demartines N. , Clavien PA . Classification surgical complication : new proposal evaluation cohort 6336 patient result survey . Ann Surg . 2004 Aug ; 240 ( 2 ) :205-13 ) ] Complications subdivide procedural ( treatment ) delay complication ( end procedure ) , subdivide major ( require additional surgery ) minor ( require endoscopic medical intervention ) complication . During admission patient monitor complication . The following standardized discharge criterion apply participate hospital : normal intake nutrition ; normal mobility ; absence fever ( &lt; 38°C ) ; stable hemoglobin level 1 day ( &lt; 1 mmol/L ) . In case day discharge hospital patient call telephone 1 day procedure whether adverse event happen . Two week intervention , research nurse contact patient telephone ask occur complication . The patient undergo direct check-up mean medical doctor 30 60 day surgery , conclude evaluation . Secondary endpoint : Skin-incision related morbidity define bleeding , infection , necrosis , skin retraction , incisional hernia , suture dehiscence within 60 day surgery . Postoperative pain define subjective evaluation parameter use horizontal visual analogical scale daily first week weekly till 60 day surgery . Patients administer Paracetamol IV 3 time day first 24h , demand . Tramadol administer Paracetamol judge sufficient pain control . On request , single-dose Ketorolac prescribed . Cosmetic result define judgement - three independent surgeon : use standardized methodology ( patient stand position black background ) , two digital photograph ( JPG format , 800x600 pixel resolution , 16x106 colour , 24 bit ) take preoperatively ( comparison ) 60 day surgery , one consist close umbilical area large view include full abdomen . A Likert scale use independently three surgeon score photographs 1 5 ( 1= poor , 2= poor , 3= satisfactory , 4= good , 5= good ) case . The mean value consider objective evaluation cosmetic outcome . - patient him/her self : patient ask score his/her subjective perception cosmetic outcome use Likert scale 60 day surgery . A following comparison two different measure give interesting proportion difference subjective objective perception . Hospital stay : length ( day ) hospital stay surgery Intra-operative time : minute skin incision end skin closure Conversion `` Single-Port ( SPC ) Multi-Ports ( 4PC ) Laparoscopy '' rate : number case surgeon prefer conversion SPC 4PC safely technical reason Conversion `` Open Surgery '' rate : number case surgeon prefer conversion SPC 4PC laparotomy safely technical reason . Long term morbidity define diagnosed morbidity relate surgical technique within 1 year surgery . Patient recruitment : Consecutive eligible patient recruit outpatient clinic participate centre involve physician . All patient fulfil above-mentioned criterion inform study physician . After consent give , central randomization take place web-based patient treat accord study protocol . Patients unable refuse provide inform consent treat accord current clinical guideline . Randomization : patient data enter web-based database blind randomization ( two experimental group : a. traditional 4-Ports Cholecystectomy ( 4PC ) vs. b. Single-Port Cholecystectomy ( SPC ) ) do unchangeable number-generating software . Blinding : Blinding patient physicians treatment unfeasible , since two treatment strategy highly different easily recognizable . Since double-blinded method possible surgical experiment , system guarantee high scientific severity . Study Population : inclusion criterion : - age : 18-75 - BMI : &lt; 30 ASA : I-III absence non-correctable coagulopathy ( international normalize ratio &gt; 1,5 , platelet count &lt; 90 × 109/l ) . - diagnosis : cholelithiasis ( gallstone &lt; 2 cm diameter ) gallbladder dyskinesia gallbladder polyp exclusion criterion : - diagnosis : cholecystitis suspect presence common duct stone suspect presence biliary cancer Previous abdominal surgery Previous umbilical surgery Intervention technique : 4-Ports Cholecystectomy ( 4PC ) : 12mmHg pneumoperitoeum create either 10mm umbelical Hasson 's port Verress needle follow 10 mm umbelical port insertion ; one 10mm two 5mm port place accord preferred technique . A straight angulate laparoscope may use . Laparoscopic graspers , monopolar hook , bipolar forceps , scissors 10mm clips-applier use . A plastic bag system might use gall bladder extraction necessary . In 10 12mm access , fascia suture resorbable suture . Skin secure either metallic agraffes interrupt suture . Single-Port Cholecystectomy ( SPC ) : 2.5cm long skin incision around umbilicus perform . The subcutaneous tissue dissect , muscular fascia expose incise along middle line ( linea alba ) respect muscular tissue . Peritoneum identify incise . The Single-Port device insert anchored . In order retract gallbladder transcutaneous suture place right hypocondrium straight needle monofilament thread pass fundus knot outside skin . The following step reproduce traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Each centre leave free use dedicate instrument traditional laparoscopic one . Complication/Intervention failure : Conversion `` single-port ( SPC ) multi-ports ( 4PC ) laparoscopy '' possible accord surgeon 's decision , perform surgical procedure . Since patient ' recruitment base `` intention treat '' convert procedure exclude study . Conversion rate consider relevant result experiment . Similarly , conversion `` open surgery '' 4PC SPC possible accord surgeon 's decision , perform surgical procedure . Since patient ' recruitment base `` intention treat '' , convert procedure wo n't exclude study . Conversion rate consider relevant result experiment . Sample size Power calculation Assuming baseline overall morbidity 5 % 4PC SPC group ( average morbidity base specific literature ) consider level difference consider clinically significant 0.05 ( 4.75 5.25 % ) SPC non-inferior , β-error 0.2 α-error 0.05 , 300 patient need per randomization group . 600 patient total allow establish equivalence term overall morbidity , statistical power 80 % . If hypothesis confirm , secondary endopoints eventually define benefit new surgical procedure term reduce skin incision 's related morbidity , low postoperative pain well cosmetic result . The sample size calculation obtain R-software ( R Project Statistical Computing , Lucent Technology , GNU General Public Licence ) version 2.10.1 , package epicalc , routine sample-size . Data analysis Intra post-operative result insert web-based database time study recruit surgeon . The photographic material up-loaded computed database well ; patient ' personal data consider strictly reserve respect privacy policy . The Kolgoromow-test use establish whether result parametric . According data feature , T-Test/Chi-Square Wilcoxon rank test use appropriate . All analysis carry primarily intention-to treat basis . Impact clinical practice healthcare system SPA Surgery emergent frontier surgical innovation represent alternative multi-ports standard laparoscopy . The trans-umbilical technique allow perform laparoscopy suppose benefit reduce invasiveness . In recent literature large number study aim demonstrate feasibility safety new method even randomize trial still available definitive conclusion . Once feasibility safety show investigate benefit patient . For reason choose primary endpoint overall morbidity order demonstrate suppose benefit ( patient 's reduced discomfort well cosmetic outcome ) skin incision morbidity take consideration . Since SPA surgical technique require consistent effort term development new technology surgeon 's adaptation , consider definition primary relevance . As matter fact , concrete introduction SPA Surgery daily practice possible without concrete advantage patient . Except one single trial compare postoperative pain ( Tsimoviannis et al . G. Hatzikosta General Hospital , Ioannina Greece ) , present similar study post USA European trial databanks . For reason , believe MUSIC trial produce precious information obvious recoil clinical activity . Track record applicants include experience field plot work carry The present MUSIC project result collaboration member EAES Technology Committee Board EAES . All applicant big experience field new technology laparoscopic surgery . In particular , many take part development new instrument new technique trans-luminal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) . Since SPA surgery consider part new concept micro-invasive approach abdominal cavity , consider knowledge particularly useful coordination trial . Considering high interest SPA-surgery express recent literature international surgical community , Technology Committee develop specific interest new branch surgical innovation .
