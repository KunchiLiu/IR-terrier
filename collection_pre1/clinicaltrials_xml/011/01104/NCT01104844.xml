	<brief_title>Maxi-Analgesic Phase 2 Study Compare Analgesic Effects Different Dosing Groups Treat Teeth Extraction Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination 500 mg acetaminophen 150 mg ibuprofen show improve analgesia compare individual component , give 2 tablet ( i.e. , total 1,000/300 mg ) 4 time day dental pain . The analgesic relief 2 tablet combination around 6 hour , consistent 4 time day dose . The combination tablet score allow low dos give 2 tablet ( total 1,000/300 mg ) , 1 tablet ( 500/150 mg ) ½ tablet ( 250/75 mg ) multiple dos . However different dose response combination need investigate confirm dose response curve combination compare relative efficacy acetaminophen different dos ibuprofen ( low high dose ) . The study hypothesis analgesic response three different combination dos , three single component dose 500mg acetaminophen 150mg 300mg ibuprofen , placebo administer four time daily 24 hour post-operative dental pain form representative dose response curve . The study design multi-centre , prospective , placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind , factorial parallel group . Participants stratify baseline pain inclusion ( moderate severe pain base 4 point pain intensity rating scale ) . Recruitment continue least 350 participant ITT population . Efficacy : The primary efficacy objective compare time-adjusted SPIDs ( Summed Pain Intensity Differences ) VAS pain intensity score 24 hour first dose study medication among 7 treatment group determine form dose-response relationship . Secondary efficacy objective : - To compare maximum VAS pain score 24-hour period first dose study medication among seven treatment group determine form dose response relationship . - To compare response rate ( response rate define percentage participant achieve least 50 % reduction baseline pain within 6 hour i.e . first dose period ) among seven treatment group determine form dose response relationship . - To determine compare time peak reduction VAS pain intensity score follow first dose study medication among seven treatment group determine form dose response relationship . - To compare time perceptible meaningful pain relief among seven treatment group use two stopwatch method . - To compare time requirement rescue medication among seven treatment group . - To compare amount rescue medication use ( defined number tablet ) among seven treatment group 24-hour treatment period . - To compare percentage participant require rescue medication among seven treatment group . - To compare categorical global pain rating among seven treatment group . Safety : To compare adverse event rate ( divide serious non-serious adverse event ) . Adverse event assess 24- hour study period 30 day final dose study medication among seven treatment group . The standard symptom expect subject recently undergone third molar extraction record AEs study , unless great severity and/or intensity would expect . The event consider standard purpose study : - Oral pain . - Facial swelling . - Oral bleeding . - Bruising face , neck , and/or jaw . - Decreased range motion jaw . - Dry socket . The Investigators use clinical judgement determine whether symptom great severity and/or intensity would expect . Planned hospital admission and/or surgical operation illness disease exist drug give participant randomize clinical study consider adverse event The incidence know specific NSAID acetaminophen side effect ( e.g . GI ulceration , Indigestion/stomach pain , post-operative bleeding , thromboembolic event evidence clinical hepatitis ) 24-hour study period 30 day last dose compare among seven treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Provide write informed consent initiation studyrelated procedure . 2 . Males female age least 16 year 40 year old day consent . 3 . Undergoing oral surgery extraction 2 impact 3rd molar teeth , one must mandibular require bone removal . 4 . Experiencing moderate severe postoperative pain , define 4 point categorical pain intensity rating scale 0 = pain ; 1 = mild pain ; 2 = moderate pain 3 = severe pain ( rest ) within 6 hour completion surgery . 5 . Baseline VAS pain intensity score &gt; 50mm 100mm VAS scale 0 = pain 100 = worst pain imaginable . Study contraindication : 1 . Has take NSAID acetaminophen within 12 hour prior start surgery aspirin ≤ 150mg/day . 2 . Subjects receive anesthetic midnight night prior surgery , except lidocaine epinephrine , nitrous oxide , diazepam ( Valium® ) , methohexital ( Brevital® ) . 3 . Known pregnant possibly pregnant . 4 . Women childbearing potential unwilling take adequate contraceptive precaution , i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method , abstinence ( subject become sexually active , must agree use doublebarrier method contraception ) . A woman childbearing potential define female less 2 year postmenopausal undergone partial total hysterectomy surgical sterilization , e.g. , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy . 5 . Suffering neurological disorder relate pain perception acute chronic condition , opinion investigator , make subject unsuitable efficacy safety perspective . 6 . In opinion investigator , unable understand visual analogue pain score comply protocol requirement . 7 . Currently last 30 day , clinical trial involve another study drug . 8 . Currently treat ACE inhibitor , warfarin , steroid ( nasal steroid topical steroid approval investigator ) , cyclosporin , tacrolimus methotrexate , medication felt investigator interfere safety efficacy evaluation . 9 . Participant weight &lt; 50kg.Suffering disease condition , opinion investigator , mean would participant 's best interest participate study . NSAID and/or acetaminophen contraindication : 10 . Hypersensitivity aspirin NSAID . 11 . Hypersensitivity acetaminophen . 12 . Severe know hemopoietic , renal hepatic disease , immunosuppressed . 13 . History gastric ulceration GI disorder , opinion investigator make subject unsuitable ( e.g. , frequent treatment GERD , inflammatory bowel disease , etc. ) . 14 . History severe asthma define asthma require frequent ongoing treatment control symptom . Exerciseinduced asthma mild asthma require ongoing treatment may exclusionary discretion investigator .</criteria>
