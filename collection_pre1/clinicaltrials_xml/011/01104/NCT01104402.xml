	<brief_summary>Individuals CF develop chronic lung infection suffer intermittent acute exacerbation lung disease . Most exacerbation treat cause increase symptom , patient seek medical attention . This proposal detail study home lung function symptom monitoring . Subjects randomly assign one two group : 1 ) home monitoring , spirometry symptom record ; 2 ) standard care . The home monitoring data transmit electronically study center . If spirometry symptom deteriorate substantially , treatment CF pulmonary exacerbation initiate . It anticipate use home monitoring lead earlier , reliable recognition treatment exacerbation , translate well lung health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Individuals CF develop chronic lung infection suffer intermittent exacerbation , require intensive treatment antibiotic . The common useful objective measure CF lung disease spirometry . Chronic treatment CF lung disease require airway clearance , mucolytics antibiotic . These treatment quite successful evidence early , aggressive treatment lung disease result well outcomes . Unfortunately , exacerbation treat cause pronounced deterioration symptom , prompt patient seek medical attention . Self-monitoring clinical status improve outcomes many disorder asthma , diabetes mellitus , lung transplantation . This important , randomized trial home lung function symptom monitoring CF . Subjects assign one two group : 1 ) Home monitoring , spirometry symptom record daily ; 2 ) Standard Care . The home monitoring data transmit electronically twice weekly study center , result review . If spirometry symptom deteriorate substantially baseline , treatment CF pulmonary exacerbation initiate . It anticipate use home monitoring translate well clinical outcome . We test hypothesis pulmonary exacerbation identify treat earlier current standard care , progression lung disease slow .</detailed_description>
