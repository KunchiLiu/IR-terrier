	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine pancreatic cancer/pre-cancer detect early stage molecular analysis stool sample . Investigators hypothesize analysis stool sample use digital melt curve ( DMC ) analysis , use sensitive specific method detect common genetic abnormality present pancreatic cancer pre-cancerous lesion pancreas .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDC ) remain fourth lead cause cancer-related death United States . This largely due fact patient present advanced , unresectable disease , highlight critical need screen test disease . Stool test approach explore use PDC screen . With advent stool-based DNA test , may possible target genetic abnormality recently characterize PDC tumorigenesis . Aim : The aim study determine deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) alteration present pancreatic cancer precancerous intrapapillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) reliably recover matched stool . Methods : This case-control prospective study determine utility stool-based digital melt curve ( DMC ) assay PDC screening . A total 30 patient ( 18 pancreatic cancer , 12 IPMN ) undergo pancreatic resection enrol . Pancreatic neoplastic tissue isolate surgical specimen gene commonly mutate PDC sequence extract DNA . In addition , hypermethylation common promoter site assess methylation-specific PCR . The genetic epigenetic alteration isolate pancreatic tissue utilized target stool DMC assay . Blinded technician process stool specimen control patient well match control . The primary outcome study sensitivity specificity stool DMC assay detect genetic mutation present tumor IPMN lesion .</detailed_description>
