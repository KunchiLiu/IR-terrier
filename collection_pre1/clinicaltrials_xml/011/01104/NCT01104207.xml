	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Tinnitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , subject clinician/observer blind , placebo-controlled parallel-group clinical trial rTMS involve people experience chronic tinnitus . Eligible subject randomly assign receive either active rTMS treatment placebo treatment either leave right side head . Subjects receive 2000 pulse 1 Hz rTMS therapy daily 10 consecutive work day . Outcomes measured prior start treatment last therapeutic session . Follow-up evaluation conduct 1 , 2 , 4 , 13 26 week last treatment session . This design allow u determine rTMS reduces severity loudness tinnitus , long-term duration relief , whether target coil placement ( left/right side head ) affect active rTMS efficacy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis chronic tinnitus . Able provide write informed consent . Subject naive regard rTMS . Age/Gender : minimum 18 year old , attempt sample equal number male female subject . Other concurrent treatment : A fourweek washout tinnitus treatment management program require prior enter study . Other medication : No restriction , provide dosage place least 6 month . Psychological status : Stable enough complete study per opinion Study Physician . Hearing function : All degree hear function include recognize profound , bilateral loss able perform tinnitus evaluation hear test , able rate subjective tinnitus loudness , annoyance impact life . This important subpopulation challenge treat acoustic therapy need medical intervention . Tinnitus characteristic : All form tinnitus etiology accept , provide follow criterion meet : Tinnitus duration : Not less 1 year . Cases le 1 year duration increase likelihood resolve spontaneously . Stability : Constant ( pulsatile , intermittent , vary high degree loudness change location perception ) . Fluctuating tinnitus reduces reliability testretest measure loudness . Selfrated tinnitus loudness : &gt; = 6 visual numerical scale ( VNS : 0 label `` No Tinnitus '' , 10 label `` Very Loud '' ) . This outcome measure provide subjective indication immediate change perceive loudness . Location tinnitus perception : Unrestricted . Tinnitus may unilateral , bilateral , perceived head . Medical condition : No active neurologic otologic disease process may impact tinnitus perception . No autoimmune diseases . No pregnancy plan pregnancy study . No woman lactate childbearingage without use contraception . Objective Tinnitus tinnitus audible people addition patient . This type tinnitus rare unlikely respond rTMS associate abnormal neural activity central auditory system . History evidence significant brain malformation neoplasm , head injury , cerebral vascular event ( stroke ) , neurodegenerative disorder affect brain ( Parkinson 's Disease , ALS , Huntington 's Disease Multiple Sclerosis ) prior brain surgery . Cardiac pace maker , electronic implant ( include cochlear implant ) , intracranial intraocular metallic particle . History seizures epileptic activity . Patients communicate reliably investigator likely cope requirement trial . Participation clinical trial within last 30 day start one . Maximum number previous clinical trial tinnitus subject may participate : two .</criteria>
