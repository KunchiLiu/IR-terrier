	<brief_summary>This retrospective observational study determine proportion patient family history pancreatic cancer malignancy among patient intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) . The investigator review demographic , clinical , radiologic , pathologic , follow-up information Pancres Center database . The investigator also conduct chart review collect information record clinician subject 's family history malignancy personal history malignancy . Results database chart review incorporate datasheet patient identifier remove . The primary outcome percentage IPMN patient least one first-degree relative pancreatic cancer IPMN , least two first second degree relative pancreatic cancer , IPMN , malignancy relate pancreatic cancer syndrome , include colorectal , gastric , breast , ovarian , melanoma neoplasm . Secondary outcome relative risk IPMN subtypes high malignant potential ( main duct mixed type location ) , advanced histology ( carcinoma situ invasive carcinoma ) , recurrence follow surgical resection amongst subject family history .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMN ) cyst-like cancer pancreas increasingly identify medical practice , include screen individual high risk pancreatic cancer . It establish 10 20 % pancreatic cancer familial . In comparison , little research importance genetic risk IPMN incidence . The investigator perform retrospective chart review patient IPMN evaluate surgical intervention tertiary referral center . The investigator interested determine proportion IPMN patient family history pancreatic cancer . In addition , investigator assess familial cancer risk associate increase risk malignant IPMN recurrence , relative patient without inherited predisposition .</detailed_description>
