	<detailed_description>End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) common clinical condition world . In population , prevalence systemic hypertension high adequate control determinate outcome . The first step good control blood pressure give dry weight patient . We understand dry weight target weight one patient feel comfortable n't clinical signal volemic overload edema , dyspnea , orthopnea , jugular turgency , hepatomegalia . Classically , dry weight assess base clinical examination , blood pressure experience hemodialysis staff . The electrical bioimpedance simple method possibility access corporal compartment , include body water , use small expensive portable device . Trying study new form get ideal dry weight , design randomize clinical trial evaluate two way get dry weight hemodialysis patient . One group dry weight fix bioimpedance data another group dry weight clinical protocol . We take 24h ABPM basal patient randomization . Then , 2 week later dry weight revise , second ABPM take . The result compare .</detailed_description>
