	<brief_title>A Dose Response Study UT-15C SR Patients With Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , randomize , parallel group study two period : 10 week , dose titration period , follow 2 week , dose maintenance period patient exercise-induced PH . The study population randomize Dose Group 1 , Dose Group 2 , Individual Maximum Tolerated Dose ( iMTD ) UT-15C SR Week 10 maintain Week 12 . Patients may either currently receive approve oral background therapy PH ( phosphodiesterase-5 [ PDE-5 ] inhibitor , OR endothelin receptor antagonist [ ERA ] ) ( dual background therapy ) , currently receive therapy PH .</detailed_description>

Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ≥ 50 % ( predict ) 2 . If FVC &lt; 50 % ( predict ) , total lung capacity ( TLC ) must ≥ 50 % ( predict ) 3 . Forced expiratory volume / force vital capacity ( FEV / FVC ) ratio ≥ 50 % 7 . Had Baseline 6MWD 150 450 meter , inclusive 8 . Was optimally treat conventional pulmonary hypertension therapy ( e.g . oral vasodilator , oxygen , digoxin , etc ) addition , discontinuation , dose change least 14 day prior Baseline ( exclude anticoagulant ) . Oral diuretic may adjust , discontinue add , within 14 day Baseline 9 . May may receive approve PDE5 inhibitor OR approve ERA . Subjects receive approve ERA approve PDE5 inhibitor must stable dose 30 day prior Baseline , willing remain PDE5 inhibitor ERA dose duration 12week Treatment Phase .

Had previous intolerance significant lack efficacy oral parenteral prostacyclin prostacyclin analogue result discontinuation inability effectively titrate therapy 3 . Had concurrent injury , illness ( PH PH related condition ) , confound factor would prevent accurate assessment subject 's exercise capacity 4 .
