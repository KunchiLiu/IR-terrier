	<brief_summary>This prospective study assess effect treatment alendronate osteoporotic patient ankylose spondylitis . Primary objective : - To investigate alendronate effect bone mineral density ( BMD ) assess dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) lumbar spine , hip distal forearm assess quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) lumbar spine Xtreme CT radius tibia . Secondary objective : - To investigate alendronate effect marker bone remodel - To investigate alendronate influence disease activity ( BASDAI ) , spinal function ( BASFI ) , spinal movement ( BASMI ) health relate quality life ( SF-36 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment With Alendronate Patients With Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) common inflammatory rheumatic disease prevalence 0.5-1.0 % . Men commonly affect disease compare woman , ratio 2.6-4:1 . Pain back frequent symptom debut . This pain often associate sacroilitis . In late stage also lumbar , thoracic cervical spine hit disease . Peripheral joint , eye , heart , lung urinary tract may also influence . The risk osteoporosis increase AS . However , field yet significantly study probably due several reason predominance men disease men seldom investigate osteoporosis compare woman . When AS progress syndesmophytes spine developed make difficult assess bone mineral density ( BMD ) correctly conventional method , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Fractures spine easy foreseen since pain patient might misjudge relate increased disease activity . Fractures also overlook radiograph AS . AS associate increase bone formation increase bone resorption . The bone remodel process spine render spine less flexible stiffer consequence also quite small trauma may result fracture . These fracture often instable risk injure spinal cord nerve . Treatment bisphosphonates AS indicated anti-inflammatory effect . The effect treatment bisphosphonate BMD assess DXA , QCT Xtreme CT AS yet fully investigate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Fulfill diagnostic criterion ankylose spondylitis , 1984 New York 2 . Patients previously include observational trial , `` Clinical study osteoporosis ankylose spondylitis '' . 3 . Patients change treatment biologics past 4 month . 4 . Patients glucocorticosteroids change dose last 4 month . 5 . BMD Tscore ≤ 2,5 SD assess DXA lumbar spine and/or hip ( total hip and/or neck ) . 6 . BMD Tscore ≤ 2,0 SD assess DXA lumbar spine and/or hip ( total hip and/or neck ) presence vertebral fracture , hip fracture peripheral fragility fracture . 7 . BMD Tscore ≤ 1,0 SD assess DXA lumbar spine and/or hip ( total hip and/or neck ) patient oral glucocorticosteroids Exclusion criterion : 1 . Ongoing treatment bisphosphonate . 2 . Ongoing treatment sexhormone . 3 . Renal insufficiency , creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml/min 4 . Difficulties swallow and/or acute illness upper gastrointestinal canal .</criteria>
