	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness Continuous Glucose Monitoring System ( DexCom™ SEVEN PLUS® ) evaluate impact CGM glycemic control worn 6-months subject 18 70 years-old Type 1 diabetes mellitus MDI CSII therapy . The primary objective study demonstrate statistically significant difference MDI CSII subject term A1C change 6 month compare baseline . A secondary objective evaluate time spend outside euglycemic region ( 70 180 mg/dL ) baseline ( blinded month ) conclusion 6 month follow-up . Safety data SEVEN PLUS System also collect safety characterize incidence Adverse Device Effects , Serious Adverse Device Events , Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects experience study participant .</brief_summary>
