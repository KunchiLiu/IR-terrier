	<brief_title>Initial Experience With Storz C-MAC Video Intubation System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction laryngoscope clinical anesthesia practice , innovator attempt improve upon perfect design laryngoscope blade . The goal innovation improve visualization laryngeal structure increase likelihood successful tracheal intubation . It estimate endotracheal intubation perform 8 million patient per year United States . Of endotracheal intubation , approximately 80 % perform direct laryngoscopy transoral placement endotracheal tube ( ET ) trachea . The incidence unsuspected difficult intubation estimate higher approximately 3 % . One factor contribute difficult intubation poor visualization airway . Video laryngoscopes relatively new edition armamentarium airway device available airway manager . Although instrument expensive traditional direct laryngoscope , offer several advantage may justify expense . While many clinician may espouse routine use video laryngoscopy , provider advocate use anticipate difficult situation , `` plan B '' fail intubation direct laryngoscopy ( DL ) . The video laryngoscopes show provide superior view traditional laryngoscopy normal difficult intubation situations.3-6 Video intubation technique , allow tracheal intubation monitoring , improve safety procedure increase intubation success . In contrast , use conventional laryngoscopy , anesthesiologists `` keyhole '' view airway structure ; view may obscure attempt pass ET tube . The C-MAC video laryngoscope late edition pool video laryngoscope . C-MAC development V-MAC ( Karl Storz Endoscopy , Inc. , Tuttlingen , Germany ) video laryngoscope . The C-MAC become commercially available US March 2009 time ; study available regard use clinical practice . The device consist laryngoscope handle Macintosh blade modify provide video image airway structure screen , conveniently locate directly front anesthesiologist . A micro video module base CMOS image sensor technology contain modify handle image/light bundle introduce standard blade . Because design , video laryngoscope system use perform either direct indirect laryngoscopy . A . General Study Design- The study include total 50 patient . All patient intubate use conventional endotracheal tube preferably without alternative aid . In operating room , standard monitoring device apply include pulse oximeter , 3 lead ( least ) , ECG blood pressure cuff ; latter could invasive non-invasive depend nature surgery . Baseline measure BP , pulse , oxygen saturation , CO2 , make . The time noted sedation anesthesia administer . Vital sign record every minute time induction anesthesia begin five minute patient intubate , five-minute interval thereafter fifteen minute . General anesthesia induce bolus administration propofol ( 2-3 mg/kg ) fentanyl ( 1-2 mcg/kg ) , maintain inhalational agent . Rocuronium ( 0.6 mg/kg ) administer , face mask ventilabilty check , provide muscle relaxation mixture sevoflurane isoflurane nitrous oxide ( per anesthesiologist choice ) utilize maintenance anesthesia ability mask ventilate confirm . The lung mechanically ventilate semi-closed circle system maintain end-tidal CO2 near 35 mmHg . Patients ' lung ventilate via anesthesia mask five minute 100 % oxygen patient completely relax . All investigator , resident attending , train base manufacturer recommendation , resident perform least 3 intubation C-MAC video laryngoscope prior enlist patient study . Intubations perform 2nd 3rd year ( CA-2 CA-3 ) resident . The resident perform direct laryngoscopy utilize C-MAC follow video laryngoscopy vice versa . In effort prevent bias , computer-generated list prepare help randomize order execution direct laryngoscopy indirect video laryngoscopy ; intubation perform second method use . The resident first take direct look larynx without manipulate scope . Then , resident take video-assisted look ( vice versa ) . Subsequently , operator compare direct view video-assisted view , intubate . He/she record observation laryngeal aperture base Cormack-Lehane Scale percentage glottic opening score ( POGO Score ) . External neck pressure may apply assistant attempt improve exposure larynx . The anesthesiologist 's assessment optimal view obtain maneuver record . To clarify , resident one attempt opportunity direct laryngoscopy in-direct video assist laryngoscopy . If , first unsuccessful attempt , attend anesthesiologist take one attempt respectively direct in-direct view . Between laryngoscopy attempt , intubator achieve easy patient ventilation next attempt make . The number attempt ( maximum 4 total ) measure either reinsertion blade endotracheal tube ) intubation time ( time laryngoscope blade enters mouth 1st capnograph breath ) also record . If unsuccessful , direct laryngoscopy/ flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy perform intubate trachea . If 4 attempt ( two maximum type laryngoscopy ) need anesthesiologist discontinue use video laryngoscope , case deem failure . The subjective level difficulty ( 0 = Extremely Easy 5 = Extremely Difficult ) performance intubation also record . There plan second phase study . This include total 50 patient anticipate difficult airway ( limited mouth opening , restrict neck movement , Mallampati 4 , thyromental distance &lt; 6 cm , BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2 ) . All patient adult surgical candidate age 18-80 year , ASA I- III , present elective surgery require general endotracheal anesthesia . We hypothesize C-MAC may safer suitable alternative device routine difficult laryngoscopy tracheal intubation . B. Measurements We record morphometric characteristic patient . The quality airway evaluate use Mallampati , thyromental distance , interincisor gap distance , neck mobility circumference , sternomental distance . All intubators note laryngoscopy experience level ( Cormack-Lehane Scale modify Yentis , POGO score ) . Additionally , anesthesiologist provide personal , subjective opinion possible difficult laryngoscopy intubation base scale 1 5 . Any evidence fogging lens note . Intubation : We measure time number attempt require successful endotracheal intubation , easiness double view ( direct v video ) , laryngoscopy view change , alternative aid ( bougie , stylet , etc ) require . An attempt define placement ETT glottic opening trachea . Removal/reinsertion laryngoscope switch laryngoscopist constitute new attempt . Once optimal positional confirm , position ETT alter . A four question survey present resident ( easy use , intuitive , think valuable teach tool , think greatest/ bad value device ) . Degree irritation : Following intubation either group , appearance oropharynx , pharynx , epiglottis , arytenoid check . The presence abrasion , bleeding , redness , perforation sign tissue dental injury record . SUBJECTS : The subject adult surgical candidate age 18-80 , ASA I- III , present elective surgery require general anesthesia . Patients choose determine endotracheal intubation require . Patients exclude consider difficult ( i.e . Mallampatti IV , &lt; 2 FB 4 cm mouth open ) , awake fiberoptic intubation perform . ASA IV V patient also exclude study addition need rapid sequence ( i.e . patient acid reflux ) know cardiovascular disease RECRUITMENT METHODS/ INFORMED CONSENT : Physician investigator interview potential subject determine subject suitable study . Written consent obtain anesthesiology resident research assistant . PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY : All information record anesthetic record keep strictly confidential data keep data logbook lock office principal investigator . We record patient study code number . DATA ANALYSIS : Data analyze use t- test , ANOVA , Fisher Exact test , appropriate . Results present mean ± SD . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
