	<brief_summary>The strategy rehabilitate pediatric hemiplegia overcome `` developmental disuse '' . Disruption excitability non-stroke hemisphere , resultant increase excitability ( disinhibition ) stroke hemisphere , achieve low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , noninvasive method stimulating target area brain . Furthermore , disruptive effect low-frequency rTMS increase prolonged precede 6-Hz priming stimulation . We recently demonstrate safety priming/low-frequency rTMS adult stroke currently engage NIH-funded study explore effectiveness , mechanism safety serial treatment rTMS combine motor learn training . Very little research , however , attempted intervention promote brain reorganization recovery hemiplegia child . Thus , study determine effectiveness , mechanism , safety 5 treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS apply non-stroke hemisphere combine constraint induce therapy ( CIT ) promote recovery paretic hand . Fifteen child pediatric hemiplegia , age 8 -16 year , two pediatric medical facility ( total N = 30 ) , randomly assign one two treatment group receive treatment 2 week . The rTMSreal/CIT group receive alternate day real rTMS CIT 5 treatment . The rTMSsham/CIT group receive alternate day sham rTMS real CIT 5 treatment . Subjects test pretest posttest . The hypothesis : 1 ) rTMS treatment show serious side effect , 2 ) group show improvement hand function rTMSsham/CIT group show significantly great improvement , 3 ) rTMSreal/CIT group also show significantly great improvement brain reorganization measure paired-pulse TMS testing , cortical silent period testing , fMRI . The propose research important little research rehabilitation-induced brain reorganization do pediatric hemiplegia . It innovative applies technique never use , i.e . 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combine CIT . The potential impact research radical change pediatric rehabilitation accomplish high functional recovery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims The propose research explore new method promote brain reorganization recovery function child hemiplegia . Evidence show although brain remarkable reorganization neural insult , change maladaptive leave individual additional loss function . In adult , motor neuron ipsilesional ( stroke ) hemisphere survive stroke undergo loss excitability . Interhemispheric ( transcallosal ) inhibition impose neuron contralesional ( non-stroke ) hemisphere . In adult child , evidence suggests increase ipsilateral projection contralesional hemisphere paretic hand , likely due compensatory behavior , actually compound disability . We postulate effectiveness paretic limb activity training enhance combined electrophysiologic intervention suppress activity contralesional motor neuron . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) potent noninvasive way influence excitability brain . rTMS , low frequency , depress neural function . By stimulate contralesional motor cortex low frequency , thereby depress interhemispheric inhibition ipsilesional motor cortex , net excitatory effect ( disinhibition ) induce upon ipsilesional motor cortex . Preceding low-frequency rTMS prim rTMS ( see ) show increase magnitude after-effect . We recently demonstrate safety single treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS adult stroke currently engage adult NIH R01-funded study explore effectiveness , mechanism safety serial treatment rTMS combine motor learn training . Failure address large gap pediatric brain reorganization perpetuates use conservative likely suboptimal treatment strategy . Our long-term goal restore excitability survive dormant motor neuron lesioned hemisphere child hemiplegia thereby promote high motor recovery . To achieve goal , objective combine effect 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS current form motor learn training , constraint induce therapy ( CIT ) , achieve synergism may yield unprecedented brain reorganization recovery function . Specific Aim # 1 : Examine safety five treatment 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS alternate five treatment CIT child hemiplegia . Adverse effect measure observation seizure , continual physician screening , evaluation cognitive function motor function nonparetic hand . The working hypothesis : 1 . Five 6-Hz prim low-frequency rTMS treatment combine CIT produce seizure activity serious adverse effect . Specific Aim # 2 . Determine synergistic effect rTMS combine CIT functional outcome child hemiplegia . Fifteen child hemiplegia two pediatric medical center ( total N=30 ) randomly assign equal number one two group : rTMSreal/CIT , rTMSsham/CIT . The working hypothesis : 1 . Both group show significant improvement functional outcome paretic hand posttest compare pretest . 2 . The rTMSreal/CIT group show significantly great improvement function paretic hand compare rTMSsham/CIT group . Specific Aim # 3 : Explore brain reorganization associate 6-Hz primed low-frequency rTMS combine CIT . Treatment-induced brain reorganization ipsilesional hemisphere explore evoked cortical excitability , use TMS paired-pulse test cortical silent period testing , well voluntary cortical recruitment use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . The working hypothesis : 1 . Both group show significantly great response TMS test fMRI test posttest compare pretest . 2 . The rTMSreal/CIT group show significantly great change compare rTMSsham/CIT group . This research innovative combine unique form noninvasive brain stimulation ( prim low-frequency rTMS ) behavioral training ( CIT ) promote synergism could achieve high recovery pediatric hemiplegia either treatment alone . The expected outcome improve hand function adverse effect lead improve quality life reduce burden care across lifespan child hemiplegia .</detailed_description>
