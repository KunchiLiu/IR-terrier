	<brief_summary>Purpose Objective : 1 . To compare effect either abbreviate protracted taper dexamethasone functional capacity newly diagnose glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) patient . 2 . To compare neurocognitive function newly diagnose GBM patient receive either abbreviate protracted taper dexamethasone . 3 . To compare skeletal muscle strength newly diagnose GBM patient receive either abbreviate protracted taper dexamethasone . 4 . To examine association functional capacity neurocognitive function patient-reported measure ( i.e . quality life , fatigue , etc . ) newly diagnose GBM patient either abbreviate protracted taper dexamethasone . 5 . To examine association functional capacity neurocognitive function body composition measure ( body-mass index , etc . ) newly diagnose GBM patient either abbreviate protracted taper dexamethasone . 6 . To examine association functional capacity neurocognitive function biochemical metabolic measurement newly diagnose GBM patient either abbreviate protracted taper dexamethasone . All study endpoint assess three timepoints follow : ( 1 ) initial assessment surgery hospital , ( 2 ) second assessment initial clinical visit Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center ( PRT-BTC ) Duke , approximately 1 week post-operatively , ( 3 ) third assessment second clinical visit PRT-BTC Duke , approximately 10 week post-operatively completion radiotherapy . An additional fourth assessment obtain 4 week post-operatively subject undergo radiotherapy Duke .</brief_summary>
