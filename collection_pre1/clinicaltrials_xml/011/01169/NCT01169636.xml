	<brief_title>Panobinostat Plus Ifosfamide , Carboplatin , Etoposide ( ICE ) Compared With ICE For Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I : The Study Drugs : Panobinostat design block function enzymes find inside cancer cell . These enzyme trigger cell grow multiply control . By block enzyme , may slow growth kill cancer cell . Ifosfamide design slow stop growth cancer cell . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die . Etoposide design block cell growth . Baseline Tests : If find eligible take part study , follow test procedure perform 7 day first dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) . - You 1 electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) . - Blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Women able become pregnant must negative blood ( 1 1/2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . Study Groups : You assign dose level panobinostat base join study . Up 2 dose level panobinostat test . Up 6participants enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose panobinostat find . All participant receive dose level ICE . Once high tolerable dose find , 20 extra participant , call expansion group , receive study drug dose . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 14 day . ICE Administration : On Day 1 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive ifosfamide vein 24 hour . On Day 1 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive carboplatin vein 1 hour . On Days 1-3 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive etoposide vein 2 hour . You also receive mesna help prevent side effect . On Day 2 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive mesna vein 12 hour . You also receive pegfilgrastim help prevent side effect . Beginning 24-48 hour completion chemotherapy Cycles 1-3 , take pegfilgrastim needle skin . Panobinostat Administration : You take panobinostat mouth start Day -6 Cycle 1 ( 6 day first dose ICE ) . You take panobinostat Days -6 , -4 , -2 Cycle 1 Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 Cycles 1 2 . If expansion group , take panobinostat mouth start Day -6 Cycle 1 ( 6 day first dose ICE ) . You take panobinostat Days -6 , -4 , -2 Cycle 1 Days 1 , 3 , 5 Cycles 1 2 . You take panobinostat around time day 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You swallow capsule whole chew . You must avoid grapefruit grapefruit juice seville ( sour ) oranges study . If miss dose panobinostat , take soon remember day . However , 12 hour pass since suppose take dose , skip day 's dose . In case , wait take panobinostat next scheduled dosing day . Study Visits : On Days -6 -2 Cycle 1 , 2 ECGs . Within 7 day ICE therapy : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . - Blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You ask side effect . One ( 1 ) time week , blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , ECG . After Cycle 3 : - You CT scan head neck , chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - If bone marrow positive screening , PET scan check status disease . Length Study : You study 3 cycle ( 42 day ) . You take study early disease worsen experience intolerable side effect . End-of-Study Visit : After study , end-of-study visit follow perform : You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . You ECG . This investigational study . Panobinostat FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . ICE FDA approve commercially available treatment several type lymphoma , include relapsed refractory Hodgkins lymphoma . The combination panobinostat ICE treatment Hodgkin 's lymphoma investigational . Up 102 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson . Phase II : The Study Drugs : Panobinostat design block function enzymes find inside cancer cell . These enzyme trigger cell grow multiply control . By block enzyme , may slow growth kill cancer cell . Ifosfamide design slow stop growth cancer cell . Carboplatin design interfere growth cancer cell stop cell division , may cause cell die .

Study Groups : You randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - If Group 1 , receive ICE . - If Group 2 , receive ICE panobinostat . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 14 day . ICE Administration : On Day 1 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive ifosfamide vein 24 hour . On Day 1 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive carboplatin vein 1 hour . On Days 1-3 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive etoposide vein 2 hour . You also receive mesna help prevent side effect . On Day 2 ( +/- 2 day ) Cycles 1-3 , receive mesna vein 12 hour . You also receive pegfilgrastim help prevent side effect . Beginning 24-48 hour completion chemotherapy Cycles 1-3 , take pegfilgrastim needle skin . Panobinostat Administration : If group receive panobinostat , take panobinostat mouth start Day -6 Cycle 1 ( 6 day first dose ICE ) . You take panobinostat 3 time week Cycles 1 2 ( Days -6 , -4 , -2 Cycle 1 Days 1 , 3 , 5 Cycles 1 2 ) . You take panobinostat around time day 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . You swallow capsule whole chew . You must avoid grapefruit grapefruit juice seville ( sour ) oranges study . If miss dose panobinostat , take soon remember day . However , 12 hour pass since suppose take dose , skip day 's dose .
