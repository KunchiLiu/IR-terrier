	<detailed_description>Clofarabine second-generation adenosine nucleoside analog activity hematologic malignancy . It gain FDA-approval use child relapsed-refractory ALL , early phase study show activity patient AML MDS . Clofarabine 's activity acute leukemia MDS establish multiple phase I II study , alone combination cytosine arabinoside ( araC ) , relapsed-refractory patient , untreated old adult . Pharmacokinetic investigation compare I.V . P.O . dose within patient perform . Furthermore , effect OCT2 inhibition clofarabine pharmacokinetics human investigate . The potential enhanced drug exposure toxicity set OCT2 inhibition clinical importance clofarabine gain broader indication hematologic oncology . In particular , bioavailability OCT2 mechanism important prolong drug exposure oral administration old adult , likely impaired renal function take drug interact OCT2 metformin ( substrate ) trimethoprim ( one several inhibitor ) . OCT2 express several solid tumor cell line , think play role tumor uptake cationic cytotoxin . Whether OCT2 transporter express leukemic blast , influence drug uptake investigate . However , variation expression drug transporter could one several mechanistic explanation fact clofarabine-responsive patient accumulate intracellular clofarabine triphosphate , whereas non-responders . Single nucleotide polymorphism identify gene encode OCT2 , may influence substrate uptake inhibitor potency . Such polymorphism may explain variation clofarabine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics individual , potential phenomenon previously investigate . Patients receive clofarabine induction therapy five dos . Initially , unless dose escalation de-escalation criterion meet , patient assign dose level 0 ( IV Clofarabine 15mg/m2 ; Oral clofarabine 30mg/m2 ) . The first three dos ( day 1 , 3 5 ) administer follow washout period extend next clofarabine dose administer . During washout period , frequent phlebotomy PK sampling perform outpatient set UNC Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) . The duration induction period determine time recovery hematologic toxicity ( platelet &gt; 50 x 109/liter , ANC &gt; 1.0x109/liter ) . AML patient achieve CR , MDS patient achieve CR , PR hematologic improvement receive additional consolidation cycle oral clofarabine daily day 1 5 subsequent cycle , clofarabine dose accord assign dose level ( 0 : 30 mg/m2 , -1 : 20 mg/m2 , +1 : 40 mg/m2 ) . Consolidation cycle begin sooner 28 day first day previous clofarabine cycle . Patients evaluated response cycle , continue trial 6 total cycle therapy long response lack progression maintain Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity observe patient .</detailed_description>
