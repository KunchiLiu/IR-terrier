	<brief_title>EP1300 Polyepitope DNA Vaccine Against Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria mosquito-borne disease cause protozoan parasite genus Plasmodium ( P. ) . It estimate 350-500 million clinical case malaria per year , account one million death . The majority death occur among child five year age Africa , especially area poor access healthcare service . Severe disease occur frequently P. falciparum , least partially due ability infect high percentage erythrocyte adhere capillary wall . Development safe effective vaccine target P. falciparum major public health goal . To truly effective general population , vaccine induce responses target `` immunologically '' conserve region . Epitope-based vaccine represent logical approach problem design focus immune response conserve epitope . The proposed clinical trial first evaluate novel deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) -based , polyepitope vaccine P. falciparum malaria . The study conduct phase I , randomize , prospective , control , single-center , dose-escalating trial . This study design provide information regard safety tolerability EP ( Electroporation ) 1300 vaccine allow development vaccine future study . Immunogenicity assess preliminary fashion secondary endpoint . The primary objective study evaluate safety , reactogenicity tolerability EP1300 ( DNA ) vaccine administer via electroporation healthy adult volunteer . The secondary objective obtain preliminary immunogenicity data EP1300 polyepitope DNA vaccine assess interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay ass tolerability administration procedure healthy volunteer . Thirty-nine healthy adult age 18 40 previous history malaria exposure infection , history travel malaria-endemic area , receive vaccine malaria infection enrol study . Subjects randomize receive 3 dos either DNA vaccine normal saline placebo day 0 , 28 , 56 . DNA dos administer dose-escalating fashion 0.25 mg 4 mg . Dose escalation proceed follow review safety data include 2-week safety data time point follow second immunization prior dosage group ; review include participation Division Microbiology Infectious Diseases Safety Monitoring Committee .</detailed_description>
