	<brief_summary>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) form heart-lung bypass use support child suffer heart lung failure whatever illness cause failure treat reverse . While ECMO , child increase risk infection , include fungal infection . Treatment fungal infection include antifungal medication also removal large intravenous ( IV ) line . Since ECMO require large IV line , proper treatment fungal infection would difficult impossible . The investigator believe give prophylactic antifungal medication child ECMO may prevent fungal infection develop first place . Fluconazole antifungal medication work well common fungal infection show safe child . Unfortunately , ECMO machine potential significantly alter drug level medication investigator know proper dose Fluconazole give child ECMO . Standard dose fluconazole 12mg per kilogram body weight give intravenously daily . Based preliminary data model study , investigator think 25mg per kilogram give weekly achieve proper drug level prevent fungal infection . The investigator obtain FDA approval give dose fluconazole child ECMO enrol study . Blood sample collect specific time around first second fluconazole dos describe PK drug extraction ECMO circuit .</brief_summary>
