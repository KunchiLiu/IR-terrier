	<brief_summary>The overall hypothesis line research varenicline decrease alcohol consumption tobacco use increase alcohol tobacco abstinence rate . In order explore hypothesis , investigator conduct two-phase study : 1 ) open label pilot study investigate effect varenicline reduction abstinence alcohol tobacco ; 2 ) optional MR spectroscopy investigate whether glutamate brain metabolite correlate measure alcohol crave severity and/or subsequent varenicline treatment response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Varenicline Alcohol Inpatient Addictions Program ( IAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal proposal explore potential efficacy varenicline reduce alcohol consumption among alcohol-dependent cigarette smoker . The hypothesis current study 24 week varenicline increase alcohol abstinence rate among smoker decrease alcohol consumption among patient receive inpatient addiction treatment alcoholism . The investigator also explore whether varenicline beneficial effect tobacco abstinence rate population tobacco user . The investigator conduct open-label pilot study determine clinical efficacy employ neuroimaging technique evaluate glutamate brain metabolite correlate measure alcohol crave severity and/or subsequent varenicline treatment response . The investigator enroll 20 subject receive treatment Mayo Clinic Inpatient Addictions Program ( IAP ) compare outcomes patient participate similar 6-month open-label study acamprosate . The Primary aim study : 1 . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy varenicline ( 0.5 mg daily 3 day , 0.5 mg twice daily day 4-7 , 1 mg twice day remain 23 week ) increase continuous alcohol abstinence rate 3 6 month among patient alcohol tobacco dependence complete treatment Mayo Clinic IAP . 2 . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy varenicline ( 0.5 mg daily 3 day , 0.5 mg twice daily day 4-7 , 1 mg twice day remain 23 week ) decrease number heavy drinking day ( &gt; 5 drinks/day men &gt; 4 drink/day woman ) 3 6 month among patient alcohol tobacco dependence complete treatment Mayo Clinic IAP . 3 . To obtain preliminary data baseline baseline endpoint change CSF volume correct concentration dorsal striatal glutamate , glutamate + glutamine , NAA measure MR spectroscopy 30 day varenicline treatment among patient alcohol tobacco dependence complete treatment Mayo Clinic IAP . Secondary aim : 1 . To obtain preliminary evidence efficacy varenicline ( 0.5 mg daily 3 day , 0.5 mg twice daily day 4-7 , 1 mg twice day remain 23 week ) increase 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rate prolong smoke abstinence 3 6 month among patient alcohol tobacco dependence complete treatment Mayo Clinic IAP . 2 . To assess tolerability varenicline ( 0.5 mg daily 3 day , 0.5 mg twice daily day 4-7 , 1 mg twice day remain 23 week ) .</detailed_description>
