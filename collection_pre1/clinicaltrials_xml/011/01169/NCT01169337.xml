	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well lenalidomide work compare observation treat patient asymptomatic high-risk asymptomatic ( smolder ) multiple myeloma . Biological therapy lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Sometimes cancer may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether lenalidomide effective treating patient high-risk smolder multiple myeloma observation alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Observation Treating Patients With Asymptomatic High-Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study risk grade 3 adverse event effect vital organ function ( cardiac , hepatic thromboembolic ) grade 4 high non-hematologic adverse event among patient receive lenalidomide treatment high-risk asymptomatic , smolder multiple myeloma . ( Phase II ) II . To compare progression free survival failure define death development symptomatic myeloma indicate treatment patient receive lenalidomide versus observation alone high-risk asymptomatic , smolder multiple myeloma . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response therapy patient treat lenalidomide treatment asymptomatic , smolder multiple myeloma . ( Phase II ) II . To determine compare response rate , time progression , 1-year progression-free survival probability , overall survival patient randomize receive lenalidomide observation set asymptomatic myeloma . ( Phase III ) III . To estimate incidence adverse event patient receive lenalidomide therapy early-stage multiple myeloma . ( Phase III ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe cohort term gene expression profile ( GEP ) cytogenetic risk classification evaluate baseline immune magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) parameter . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate impact therapy within GEP-defined risk group GEP prognostic marker . ( Phase III ) III . To study effect lenalidomide laboratory marker immune function . ( Phase III ) IV . To study prognostic value MRI-detected asymptomatic bone disease clinical outcome . ( Phase III ) V. To evaluate prognostic effect baseline high-risk cytogenetic abnormality clinical outcome . ( Phase III ) QUATERNARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare quality life ( QOL ) change treatment observation arm base functional ( FWB ) physical ( PWB ) well-being component Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -General ( G ) patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) measure registration ( prior initiation treatment ) cycle 24 . II . To examine impact differential treatment response ( PFS ) , observe , QOL base FACT FWB+PWB cycle 48 . III . To obtain prospective data myeloma specific QOL attribute , utilize evaluate Multiple Myeloma Subscale ( MMS ) . OUTLINE : PHASE II : Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE III : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients undergo observation progression symptomatic myeloma . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
