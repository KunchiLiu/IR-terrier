	<brief_title>A Retrospective Analysis Statin Use Outcome After Thoracic Cancer Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins well establish use primary secondary prevention cardiovascular disease . Moreover , increase evidence statin numerous effect separate lipid lower propertiesâ€”pleiotropic effect . These pleiotropic effect , include reduction inflammatory response improve endothelial function , may improve perioperative outcome via modulation surgical stress response . Improved perioperative outcome demonstrate patient undergo vascular , cardiac non-cardiovascular surgery . Specific thoracic surgery population , statin use report reduce incidence atrial fibrillation . Statins , via inhibition rate limit step mevalonate pathway , also spark interest potential anticancer effect well cancer prevention . There evidence anticancer effect statins patient esophageal lung cancer . Additionally , agent know anti-inflammatory effect also point potential improve outcome cancer patient . In regard , aspirin use report associate prolonged survival breast cancer patient , perioperative use anti-inflammatory agent ( COX-II inhibitor use lung cancer ; aprotinin use mesothelioma ; aprotinin use esophageal cancer ) associate improved postoperative survival . Moreover , use regional analgesia commonly employ thoracic surgery population associate attenuation metastasis improvement recurrence rate type cancer . In prospective pilot study patient undergo elective thoracic surgery , collaborative member group recently find patient suffer postoperative complication poorer endothelial function , measure flow mediate dilation . Those patient poorer endothelial function great wound heal complication ( 6 % vs. 0 % , p=0.01 ) , long ICU length stay ( 4 vs. 0.9 day , p=0.02 ) , long hospital length stay ( 14 vs. 6.9 day , p=0.01 ) . Although pilot study underpowered demonstrate significant correlation Brachial Artery Reactivity Testing ( BART ) derive endothelial function `` '' postoperative complication , provide hypothesis generate data support hypothesis statin , modulators endothelial function , may role improve postoperative outcome .</detailed_description>
