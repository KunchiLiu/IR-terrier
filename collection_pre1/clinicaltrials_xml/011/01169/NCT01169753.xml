A placebo tablet look like study drug active ingredient . - If Group 2 , take placebo Weeks 1 2 armodafinil Weeks 4 5 . Neither study staff know group assign . However , need safety , study staff able find receiving time . You give fatigue diary drug diary . You fill fatigue diary every day answer 2 question fatigue . You fill drug diary every day write take study drug/placebo . You return unused drug/placebo end Weeks 2 5 . At Week 5 , ask prefer first period ( Weeks 1 2 study ) second period ( Weeks 4 5 study ) . If doctor think best interest benefitting point , able continue take study drug additional study visit . If one patient select PK test , final result PK test entire group need complete start long term use study drug . If take study drug Week 5 , take 3 tablet every day rest time take study drug . Study Visits : At end Weeks 1 , 3 , 4 : - You ask symptom may drug may take . - You complete 2 questionnaire fatigue activity . It take 10 minute complete questionnaire . - Your blood pressure measure ( Weeks 1 4 ) . At end Weeks 2 5 : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You complete questionnaire complete screen . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - If select PK test screening , also PK blood sample draw end Week 2 Week 5 . - You complete series test check memory , motor skill , think complete screening . At Weeks 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 : - You ask symptom may drug may take . - You complete 2 questionnaire fatigue activity . - Your blood pressure measure . If schedule come MD Anderson Weeks 1 , 3 , 4 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , procedure perform time perform home . You call ask question describe visit . You take 2 separate blood pressure measurements 5 minute apart day report result research staff telephone . If choose take blood pressure measurements home , provide home blood pressure monitor screen taught use . The monitor return study staff end study . Length Study : You may continue take study drug part study 24 week . If benefit 24 week , may continue take study drug study . If one patient select PK test , final result PK test entire group need complete start long term use study drug . You take study time intolerable side effect study doctor think best interest . End Treatment : About 6 month end Week 5 , follow test procedure perform : - You complete questionnaire complete screen . - You complete series test check memory , motor skill , think complete screening . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . Follow-Up : The study staff call 30 day last dose study drug ask symptom complaint may , well drug may take . This call last 10 minute . This investigational study .
