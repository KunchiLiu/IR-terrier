	<brief_summary>The recent expansion indication implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) change population patient implant . Younger healthy patient implant primary prevention sudden cardiac death . Due young population , likelihood lead fail lifetime patient higher also likely need extraction . To reduce risk lead extraction procedure therefore reduce number abandon lead , ICD lead manufacturer design lead offer improve chronic extractability reduce morbidity mortality procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lead Extract Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enroll 100 subject site . Prior procedure information collect include subject demographic , medication , medical , cardiovascular surgical history . During lead extraction procedure specific data gather include item : total lead length , lead length insertion site connector end lead prior lead extraction , extraction tool use physician description extraction . The patient undergo assessment extraction force 3 kilogram maximum ICD lead specify amount time use laser extraction sheath . Extraction force approximate time monitor record throughout procedure . Forces measure use force gauge . Xrays take show lead position movement arm side , head across chest . Fluoroscopy image heart may save . The amount extra time add case order perform study collect data estimate 10 minute . Participation study complete following procedure . There 30-day follow-up phone call capture adverse event require clinic visit , ER visit hospitalization .</detailed_description>
