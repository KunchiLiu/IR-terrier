	<brief_summary>The purpose present study evaluate hemodialysis patient , elevate serum ferritin ( &gt; 2000ng/ml ) transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) &gt; 30 % , iron deposition heart , pancreas , liver spleen use T2* MRI technique . In addition , also measure free iron form plasma LPI , LCI red blood cell , platelet PMN , addition serum hepcidin , TSAT , serum ferritin , CRP oxidative stress parameter ( ROS , GSH , malonyldialdehyde ( MDA ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite forego advance management anemia associate chronic kidney disease use erythropoiesis stimulate agent intravenous iron , assessment iron status patient remain unresolved issue . It estimate follow administration erythropoietin together intravenous iron , nearly 50 % hemodialysis patient United state serum ferritin &gt; 500ng/ml ( 1 ) . However , many patient high serum ferritin level ( &gt; 2000ng/ml ) document . These level indicative iron overload , also define hemosiderosis ( 2 ) . The risk use IV iron spite serum ferritin level &gt; 2000ng/ml result accumulation excess iron tissue , heart , liver , pancreas similar finding patient hemochromatosis ( 3 ) possible deleterious effect . Accordingly , recent study indicate mathematically significant correlation serum ferritin liver iron store use indirect image know SQUID ( 4 ) . Recently , T2*MRI ( magnetic resonance image ) become non-invasive modality evaluate tissue iron store ( 5 ) . Since high iron content shorten T2* relaxation , decrease T2* value advocate early marker iron deposition target organ , relate paramagnetic property hemosiderosis ( 5 ) . This method commonly use evaluate monitor iron deposition major organ thalassemia major myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) multitransfused . In former disease , one consequence iron overload presence labile iron form , redox active therefore associated propensity catalyze generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) Haber Weiss reaction .Two form labile iron identify , one plasma ( Labile plasma iron-LPI ) find cell ( labile cellular iron -LCI ) ( 6,7 ) . In iron overload syndrome hemochromatosis , thalassemia MDS labile iron form increase , cause increase generation oxidative stress subsequent damage membrane , cytoplasmatic nuclear component . An important master regulator iron hemostasis hepcidin , liver derive acute phase protein , synthesis regulate cytokine iron status body ( 8 ) . It suggest increase hepcidin level may also contribute significantly severity anemia CKD .</detailed_description>
