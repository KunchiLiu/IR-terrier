	<brief_summary>The purpose study test new drug call MK-2206 . This study phase II study . In cancer study , phase II study find effect , good and/or bad , new treatment certain type cancer . MK-2206 oral medication know targeted therapy . By attach target , hope MK-2206 may stop cancer cell growth divide . This study help find MK-2206 helpful drug take patient neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm moderately well differentiate metastatic unresectable carcinoid islet cell tumor . Patient least one measurable lesion great equal 20 mm CT MRI image . Patients therapy somatostatin analog eligible entry must stable dose least 3 month evidence tumor shrinkage time period . Patient ≥18 year age day sign informed consent . Patient performance status 01 ECOG Performance Scale . Patient adequate organ function indicate follow laboratory value : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/mcL Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Serum Creatinine ≤2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) / OR calculate CrCl ≥60 mL/min ( patient creatinine level ≥2 time ULN ) . Patient may dialysis Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 time ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤5 time ULN HgbA1c ≤ 8 % Fasting Glucose ≤120 mg/dl Creatinine clearance calculate CockcroftGault method.Fasting define least 4 hour without oral intake . Patient voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent . Previous local therapy ( e.g . chemoembolization bland embolization ) allow complete &gt; 6 week 5X halflife prior study entry . For patient receive local therapy prior study entry , must either document growth measurable disease within embolization field outside embolization field , , prior study entry area embolization field site measurable disease . Previous chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and/or biologic therapy , include investigational agent , is/are allow complete &gt; 4 week prior study entry ( &gt; 6 week last regimen contain bevacizumab , BCNU mitomycin C , &gt; 6 week last dose radiation therapy radiopharmaceutical . Patients must disease currently amenable curative surgery . Prior surgery allow less 6 week prior study entry . Patients diabetes mellitus eligible study entry must control diabetes define hemoglobin A1c &lt; 8.0 % within 2 week initiation protocol therapy . Patient toxicity prior therapy resolve grade 1 grade 0 . Patient know active CNS metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis exclude . However , patient CNS metastasis complete course therapy would eligible study provide clinically stable 1 month prior entry define : ( 1 ) evidence new enlarge CNS metastasis ( 2 ) steroid use minimize surround brain edema . Patient active malignancy metastatic potential know carcinoid islet cell tumor , past 3 year . Patient known hypersensitivity component study drug ( MK2206 ) analogs treatable premedication antihistamine steroid . Patient condition , include limited symptomatic congestive heart failure unstable angina pectoris serious cardiac arrhythmia history current evidence myocardial infarction last 6 month , and/or current ECG trace abnormal opinion treat investigator QTc prolongation &gt; 450 msec ( Bazett 's formula ) Patient evidence clinically significant bradycardia ( HR &lt; 50 ) , history clinically significant bradyarrhythmias sick sinus syndrome , 2nd degree AV block ( Mobitz Type 2 ) . Patient uncontrolled hypertension ( i.e. , 160/90 mHg SiBP ) . Patients control antihypertensive medication allow enter study . Patient significant risk hypokalemia ( e.g. , patient high dose diuretic , recurrent diarrhea ) Patient know diabetic poorly control ( HBAc &gt; 8 % ) Patient history current evidence condition , therapy , lab abnormality might confound result study , interfere patient 's participation full duration study , best interest patient participate , opinion treat Investigator . Patient know psychiatric substance abuse disorder would interfere cooperation requirement trial . Patient , time signing informed consent , regular user ( include ―recreational use‖ ) illicit drug recent history ( within last year ) drug alcohol abuse . Patient pregnant breastfeeding , expect conceive father child within project duration study . Patient known Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive Patient know history Hepatitis C active Hepatitis A B . Patient symptomatic ascites pleural effusion . A patient clinically stable follow treatment condition eligible . Patient prior treatment mTOR inhibitor afinitor , sirolimus , temsirolimus .</criteria>
