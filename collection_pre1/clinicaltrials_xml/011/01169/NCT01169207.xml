	<detailed_description>The inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) —Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) estimate combined prevalence 0.2 % 0.3 % United States , two eight time prevalent Jewish Americans Central Eastern European descent ( Ashkenazi Jews ) compare non-Jewish Americans . CD may involve part gastrointestinal tract , often colon terminal ileum . Bowel inflammation discontinuous , transmural , may contain granuloma . CD also associate bowel stenoses intestinal perianal fistula . UC , contrast , involve continuous , non-granulomatous inflammation colon rectum , limited mucosal layer . Fistulas observe . Colonic disease clearly identify CD UC designate `` indeterminate colitis '' . There strong evidence twin study familial aggregation CD UC large part genetic , follow complex , non-Mendelian mode inheritance . First-degree relative IBD patient 8 10 fold increase risk develop IBD . Therefore , hypothesize IBD part result mutation disease polymorphisms specific susceptibility gene . Furthermore , complication , site disease , onset severity show increase familial concordance . Therefore , perhaps factor variability disease expression course appear part genetic control . The hypothesis familial disease aggregation result IBD susceptibility gene disease risk polymorphisms mutation . Loci contain disease gene identify linkage map disease gene polymorphism determine show linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) disease variant great affected IBD case compare within family ( parental ) unrelated , matched control . Power analyse show 80 % power identify IBD susceptibility loci relative sibling risk 1.5 error p = 0.01 heterogeneity 0.3 would require genome screen approximately 200 affect relative pair pedigree . It would require several time number pedigree power establish loci genome wide level significance ( Brant Shugart , Inflamm Bowel Dis , 2004 ) . To power establish ( p = 10-7 ) disease specific risk polymorphism LD association analyses—for genotypic relative risk 2.0 complex model inheritance would require 350 700 case 350 700 control similar number parental/affected offspring `` trio '' pedigree ( i.e . 1400 parent 700 affect offspring ) ( Knapp , AJHG , 1999 ) . To establish low relative risk polymorphism would require three time number . The current protocol initiated 1996 initially collect multiplex pedigree linkage study . The investigator perform first IBD genome screen North America 1998 DNAs pedigree collect study combine Univ . Chicago identify multiple locus , confirm IBD1 locus chromosome 16 . In 2003 , investigator publish second genome wide screen also include large series patient recruit Johns Hopkins protocol identify comfirming additional locus . The investigator ( others ) identify 8 confirm IBD locus ( IBD1-8 ) , several additional locus strong evidence one screen ( Brant Shugart , Inflamm Bowel Dis. , 2004 ) . The investigator recently receive funding new genome screen perform NIH fund Center Inherited Disease Research ( CIDR ) genotyping facility , sample submit time . From multiple locus , three proven disease gene IBD establish ; provocative NOD2/CARD15 gene IBD1 locus . This gene intracellular sensor bacterial cell wall component critical player innate immune system know important IBD pathogenesis ( Hugot et al Ogura et al ; Nature , 2001 ) . The investigator participate discovery ( Ogura et al. , Nature , 2001 ) . There three independent mutation NOD2 gene ( G908R , R702W , Cins1007fs ) consistently increase white CD patient compare healthy control . These mutation interfere gene 's ability sense muramyl dipeptide , critical bacterial cell wall residue . The investigator add protocol 2001 permission study isolate cell biomarkers large blood withdrawal study subject investigator find evidence NOD2 gene expression variant . The two establish genetic factor haplotype association HLA region ( IBD3 ) chromosome 5q cytokine cluster ( IBD5 , lead candidate functional mutation OCTN1/2 gene ) . The investigator also identify NFKB1 MDR1 IBD predispose polymorphism . Despite excite discovery multiple gene associate IBD , altogether , gene account fraction familial risk . Therefore , investigator continue enroll participant meet present goal recruitment 2,500 sample compose IBD pedigree linkage familial LD study , singleton case control case-control LD association study . The investigator also work discover association gene biomarkers serum ( investigator examine anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody NOD2 ) , cell blood immortalized blood IBD patient compare control . In addition , investigator test biomarkers evaluate potential predictor disease course therapeutic outcome .</detailed_description>
