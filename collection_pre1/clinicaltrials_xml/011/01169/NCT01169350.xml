	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study 18F-fluoromisonidazole fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT scan see well work assess oxygen tumor tissue patient soft tissue sarcoma undergo chemotherapy without radiation therapy . Using diagnostic procedure , 18F-fluoromisonidazole fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan CT scan , find oxygen tumor cell may help plan cancer treatment . It may also help doctor predict well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>18F-Fluoromisonidazole Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT Scans Assessing Oxygen Tumor Tissue Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma Undergoing Chemotherapy With Without Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate potential 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( [ 18F ] FMISO ) non-invasive indicator tissue hypoxia provide tumor-imaging data correlate tissue marker hypoxia patient soft tissue sarcoma treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy without radiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test [ 18F ] FMISO tumor uptake independent predictor patient outcome provide additional predictive power fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan . II . Test [ 18F ] FMISO tumor uptake predictor response subgroup patient treat radiotherapy chemotherapy . III . Test reproducibility [ 18F ] FMISO uptake tumor image patient sequential day test-retest protocol . IV . Determine relationship hypoxia-related biomarkers ( HIF1-a VEGF ) , proliferation biomarkers ( microvascular density , p53 , Ki-67 ) , regional [ 18F ] FMISO uptake tumor . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 [ 18F ] FDG 18F-fluoromisonidazole ( [ 18F ] FMISO ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan start neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( without without radiotherapy ) completion 4 course neoadjuvant therapy . NOTE : Some patient may undergo repeat [ 18F ] FMISO PET/CT scan within 48 hour first [ 18F ] FMISO scan evaluate variability ( test-retest ) image measurement . Blood sample collect completion [ 18F ] FMISO [ 18F ] FDG PET/CT scan laboratory biomarker study IHC assay . Tumor sample biopsy surgery also collect biomarker study . After completion study procedure , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
