	<brief_title>Critical Smoke Alarm Characteristics Awaken Children From Stage 4 Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Being asleep time residential fire important risk factor fire-related death . Children 5-12 year age unlikely awaken conventional residential tone smoke alarm event fire . However , finding preliminary research strongly suggest effective practical alarm age group achievable . Building previous work , objective study determine key smoke alarm characteristic awaken child prompt escape . We achieve study objective two specific aim . Specific Aim 1 test hypothesis specific characteristic voice smoke alarm ( i.e. , use child 's first name , behavior command message content , use mother 's voice , stimulus frequency ) awaken child 5-12 year old stage 4 sleep . The successful child 's alarm test among adult subject evaluate effectiveness across age spectrum . Specific Aim 2 test hypothesis specific characteristic voice smoke alarm ( i.e. , use mother 's voice behavior command message content ) result successful completion simulate escape behavior child 5-12 year old awakening stage 4 sleep . The successful child 's alarm test among adult subject evaluate effectiveness across age spectrum . Using randomized , non-blinded , repeated measure , clinical intervention design , two work hypothesis state Specific Aims 1 2 test five link study . Study 1 . Identification Specific Maternal Voice Smoke Alarm Characteristics Associated With Awakening Escaping . Using randomized , non-blinded , repeated measure , clinical intervention design , Study 1 identify critical element ( i.e. , use child 's first name and/or behavior command message content ) maternal voice signal significantly associate EEG-defined awakening ( completion simulate escape behavior child awaken S4 ) . A conventional residential tone smoke alarm meeting current NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm Code use reference stimulus allow comparison response voice alarm stimulus responses conventional residential tone alarm stimulus . Alarm stimulus test S4 study , deep stage sleep refractory arousal . If alarm stimulus successful awaken child S4 prompt escape , stimuli expect least successful stage sleep . We want develop alarm provide effective stimulus sleep child high risk non-response . During Study 1 , subject randomly assign sequence four alarm stimulus use Latin Square design , minimize possibility sequence effect . Block randomization age range ( 5-6 , 7-8 , 9-10 , 11-12 year ) gender use ensure two variable equally represent sequence . A different alarm stimulus give S4 period first second sleep cycle two separate non-consecutive night . Consecutive night test do avoid possible confounding effect sleep deprivation . This study 's repeated measure design avoid potential confounding effect due variation AATs among individual ( inter-subject variability ) take advantage stability AATs individual among sleep cycle night night night ( intra-subject variability ) ( Bonnet , et al. , 1978 ; Zepelin , et al. , 1984 ; Bruck , 2001 ) . Study 2 . Comparison Mother 's Versus Stranger 's Voice Smoke Alarms Alarm Frequency . Study 2 take voice alarm script successful Study 1 awaken prompt child perform simulate escape behavior , compare mother 's voice female stranger 's voice use script . This determine whether mother 's voice critical factor success voice smoke alarm . In addition , Temporal-Three ( T-3 ) pattern smoke alarm dominant tone low frequency range similar human voice range include stimulus Study 2 evaluate influence alarm signal frequency EEG-defined awakening ( well completion simulate escape behavior child awaken S4 ) . As Study 1 , conventional residential tone smoke alarm use reference stimulus Study 2 . This conventional residential tone alarm high frequency signal T-3 tone alarm . If one alarm script tie effective Study 1 , script least personalize use Study 2 . This decision rule base injury prevention theory ( Baker , 1981 ) dictate voice alarm require least effort parent ( personalize script child 's name case ) likely implement . Indeed , voice alarm would likely used parent , likely use correctly , one require personalization . For example , voice alarm pre-recorded , effective , fire safety-appropriate , urgent evacuation message ( equivalent `` Wake ! Get bed ! Leave room ! '' female stranger 's voice propose study ) could purchase , installed parent directly package , would likely result need protection . If study demonstrate personalization alarm message ( use child 's first name mother 's voice ) associate improved awakening escaping , could eliminate need record mechanism voice smoke alarm , currently find KidSmart alarm . Decreasing technical complexity alarm bring price , could increase use low income home high risk residential fire . The low frequency T-3 alarm use Study 2 Simplex 1996 , 4100 Fire Alarm fundamental frequency 500Hz additional dominant frequency 1500Hz 2500Hz . This alarm previously use Proulx Laroche ( 2003 ) Bruck , et al . ( 2004 ) . Although use alarm evaluate influence alteration frequency voice alarm stimulus awaken , allow test effect alarm frequency awaken compare success low frequency T-3 alarm alarm Study 2 . Since July 1996 , NFPA 72 National Fire Alarm Code require building equip fire alarm system must sound Temporal-Three ( T-3 ) pattern define ISO 8201 ( International Organization Standardization , 1987 ) . The international standard address signal 's length , sound pressure level , temporal aspect , stipulate requirement signal frequency . However , Bruck , et al . ( 2004 ) suggest alarm frequency may key factor awaken sleep child . Using design Study 1 , subject Study 2 block randomize age range gender sequence four alarm stimulus use Latin Square design . Using repeated measure design , different alarm stimulus give S4 period first second sleep cycle two separate non-consecutive night . Study 3 . Active Comparator : Adults 20-49 Years Age Using randomize , non-blinded , repeated measure , clinical intervention design , two work hypothesis state Specific Aims 1 2 test link study , Study 3 , adult participant 20-49 year age ensure alarm test also work adult age group . This arm use alarm signal identify Study 2 significantly associate Electroencephalography ( EEG ) -defined awaken successful completion simulate escape behavior child awaken slow wave sleep . A low frequency tone smoke alarm evaluate influence alarm signal frequency awaken . A conventional residential tone smoke alarm use reference stimulus . Both male female voice use alarm stimulus . Note stranger ' voice , mother 's voice . Study 4 . Active Comparator : Older Adults 60-84 Years Age Study 4 project take voice alarm script Study 2 compare low-frequency 520 Hz square wave tone smoke alarm awaken old adult 60-84 year age slow wave sleep prompt performance simulate escape procedure . Note necessarily female stranger 's voice , mother 's voice , old age group . As Studies 1 2 , conventional residential tone smoke alarm use reference stimulus Study 4 . In order maintain experimental design across study , fourth alarm type introduce . This fourth alarm hybrid low-frequency 520 Hz square wave tone smoke alarm voice alarm , i.e. , stimulus begin 520 Hz square wave tone T-3 pattern follow voice script , stimulus repeat subject completes escape procedure . The simulated escape procedure old adult different child adult ( 20-49 year age ) study ( Studies 1 , 2 , 3 ) . It consist participant sit his/her bed press button anchor wall beside bed stop alarm . This avoid concern fall old age group upon awaken . Study 5 . Children 5-12 Years Age ( Testing Male Voice Hybrid Tone/Voice Alarm ) Using randomize , non-blinded , repeated measure , clinical intervention design , two work hypothesis state Specific Aims 1 2 test Study 5 among child 5-12 year age use follow 4 alarm stimulus : female stranger 's voice , male stranger 's voice , hybrid low-frequency 520 Hz square wave tone smoke alarm voice alarm ( Study 4 ) , conventional high frequency tone residential alarm . This study arm allow comparison male versus female voice also evaluate hybrid low frequency tone/voice alarm among child 5-12 year age . The protocol use child study arm use Studies 1 2 .</detailed_description>
