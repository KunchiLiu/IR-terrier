	<brief_title>Ridaforolimus Vorinostat Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose combination Ridaforolimus Vorinostat safe tolerable . II . To define maximum tolerate dose . III . To characterize dose limit toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe activity combination amongst enrol patient term response rate , progression free survival overall survival . II . To describe activity combination subset patient RCC term response rate , progression free survival overall survival . III . To describe pharmacodynamic effect agent combination . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive ridaforolimus orally ( PO ) daily day 1-5 vorinostat PO twice daily day 1-3 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every three month 3 year .</detailed_description>
