	<brief_summary>The investigator research discover gene cause Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) specifically African American population . Who May Join This Study ? Blacks / African Americans without Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . If agree join study , investigator ask give u information health . The investigator also ask give u blood sample may discover gene cause IBD . The blood sample may collect Johns Hopkins local facility convenient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Center African-American Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study ( MAAIS ) : The Search New Genes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This current protocol establish part NIDDK consortium initiative explore genetic factor associate IBD . Specifically , investigator interest identify genetic , environment socio-economical component contribute development IBD African American population . Positional identification IBD gene perform ancestral European American ( EA ) population . Recent report find IBD incidence may similar AA EA ( Kurata et al . 1992 ) . Because different ancestry , AA IBD risk allele may unique . For example , investigator find common NOD2 mutation initial genotyping small set AA CD patient . A search scientific literature demonstrate great 1000 publish study concern IBD gene mapping , gene association simply genetic epidemiology , none contain reference IBD `` black African Americans . '' Therefore , genetics IBD African Americans unknown . The goal study understand genetics IBD African Americans . The investigator specifically characterize IBD1 , IBD3 , IBD5 genetic locus population . In addition , investigator investigate possible role variation OCTN cation transporter gene recently find associated Crohn 's disease European population . IBD believe cause combination environmental genetic factor . Genotype data examine alongside potential environmental factor smoke , medication , environmental exposure , dietary factor . Since IBD know predominantly affect Western , industrialize area world , investigator also inquire participant ' socioeconomic background hop identify previously unknown factor AA population may increase risk IBD population . These potential environmental factor important association analysis use covariates factor obscure potential association interact genetic factor thus contribute genetic association . The investigator also obtain information ancestry parent grandparent best match case unrelated control similar ancestry ( e.g. , Caribbean , recent European recent African ancestry could cause genetic mismatch case control ) . At time , investigator also collect similar information ( smoking , medication , environmental exposure dietary factor ) non-African Americans purpose make direct comparison parameter different racial group assess contribution non-genetic factor susceptibility development IBD . The protocol call recruit AA patient ethnically match control ( friend spouse ) relatives without IBD . These person provide u blood sample information request questionnaire ask follow : clinical course history IBD general health , smoke history , socioeconomic variable specific dietary factor know population related IBD etiology . Access medical record use confirm diagnose . The clinical characteristic IBD obtain medical record summarize phenotyping form use standardized NIDDK IBDGC Phenotyping Operations Manual . Controls ask health history identify potentially unrecognized IBD . Parents sibling use within-family control ( particularly family base linkage disequilibrium test ) , distant relative useful determine haplotype , family history IBD present , potential linkage analysis test chromosomal region share affected relative pair . Such analysis robust unrecognized population stratification ; study perform AA population . DNA purify blood use identify genetic polymorphism associate AA IBD , compare within-family unrelated control . Samples data also share NIDDK IBD GC use IBDGC research project . They process stored Rutgers University/Cell Repository NIDDK IBDGC Data Coordinating Center University Chicago . In addition , serum sample purify blood process store Fisher Bioservices Consortium project . Recruitment also target non-African American patient comparison purpose . These patient administer questionnaire . At time enrollment , blood draw require permission request participant contact future date blood draw need . Participants obligate provide blood sample late time sign new consent give u explicit permission . A secondary goal study determine whether racial difference IBD health outcome health utilization . The investigator compare African Americans subject white comparison group detail . In addition clinical questionnaire , phone interviewer contact subset IBD patient ( adult age 18 older ) ask willing participate phone survey obtain verbal consent . This health service supplemental questionnaire inquire insurance access , physician utilization , health-related quality life , index disease severity , income , occupational history , patient-reported adherence , patient trust-in-physicians .</detailed_description>
