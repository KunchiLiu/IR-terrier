	<brief_summary>The success human expedition mission critically depend ability crew alert maintain high level cognitive function operating complex , technical equipment . Optimal human health , performance safety space flight require sufficient sleep synchrony circadian pacemaker—which regulate time sleep , endocrine function , alertness performance—and time impose sleep-wake schedule . Crewmembers 105-day simulation study require work one night shift every sixth night . This schedule likely result sleep loss circadian misalignment , especially light condition similar crewmembers experience spaceflight . External mission controller work 24-hour shift , also result sleep loss circadian misalignment . It well document laboratory field study work night shift work extended duration shift result decrement alertness , performance mood . In addition negative effect night shift work alertness , performance mood , shift work cause significant short long-term health problem . Shift worker , particularly night shift worker invert normal sleep/wake schedule , suffer several reason . First , endogenous circadian rhythm impose sleep/work schedule typically phase . This similar experience jet lag . However , environment cue ( e.g. , sunrise , sunset , time meal sleep ) enable traveler adapt quickly new time zone , crewmembers 105-day simulation unable spend one night every five working . When work night shift , time meal , work , sleep therefore phase normal entrained phase circadian timing system . Ingestion meal inappropriate circadian phase result impair metabolism , likely underlying gastrointestinal metabolic problem experience shift worker . Second , circadian misalignment lead substantial loss sleep efficiency ( daytime ) sleep period , independent , addition , environmental obstacle sleep ( e.g. , noise , light , crewmembers ) . Third , misalignment circadian phase couple sleep loss result deterioration alertness impairment performance night . Since adverse effect particularly acute first night work , plan crewmembers Mars 105 mission work midnight shift every sixth night subject repeatedly performance impairment associate acute circadian misalignment acute sleep deprivation . Lighting Countermeasure . Our group Harvard Medical School successfully develop test effective photic countermeasure alleviate circadian misalignment improve alertness , performance mood night shift worker . The effective countermeasure circadian alignment appropriately-timed sufficiently intense light . Light also acutely improve alertness , performance mood . Most recently report short wavelength light show effective resetting circadian rhythm acutely improve performance night work via antecedent suppression soporific hormone melatonin . These photic countermeasure test individual subject live laboratory simulation ( Countermeasures readiness level/Technology readiness level 7 ; Evaluation human subject control laboratory simulate operational spaceflight environment ) . The next critical step evaluate countermeasures operational simulation space flight include study interaction among crew member high fidelity simulation ( Countermeasures readiness level/Technology readiness level 8 ; Validation human subject actual operational spaceflight demonstrate efficacy operational feasibility ) . Adequate sleep circadian alignment critical maintaining health performance expedition mission crewmembers . Testing develop light countermeasure high fidelity operational environment imitate condition future expedition mission ( e.g. , Mars ) critical ensure countermeasure readiness reduce risk human performance error due factor related circadian disruption , sleep loss fatigue . Development test photic countermeasure mission controller work 24-hour shift ensure success future long duration expedition mission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective task investigation . The purpose study validate efficacy operational feasibility photic countermeasure improve alertness performance night shift work occur simulated expedition mission . We propose address follow specific aim : Specific Aim 1 . Evaluate feasibility monitor sleep circadian neuroendocrine rhythm high fidelity operational simulation 105-day expedition mission , preparation monitoring long duration simulation include 24.65-hour Martian sol . Specific Aim 2 . Test hypothesis sleep , alertness , performance mood impaired acute circadian misalignment associate night shift work operation high fidelity operational simulation 105-day expedition mission ; Specific Aim 3 . Test hypothesis alertness , performance mood crewmembers expose short wavelength light ( peak wavelength 485 525 nm ) night shift console monitoring room significantly well alertness , performance mood crewmembers expose intermediate wavelength light ( peak wavelength either 545 nm 555 nm ) longer wavelength light ( 620 nm 690 nm ) night shift . We hypothesize improvement alertness , performance mood associate suppression pineal hormone melatonin . Melatonin level expect low across night shift exposure short 485 nm-525 nm light ; low first quartile night shift exposure intermediate wavelength 545 nm-555 nm light ; high exposure long wavelength 620 nm-690 nm light . This aim permit u evaluate feasibility deploy light countermeasure ( Light Tower ; Sunnex Biotechnologies Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada ; ww.Sunnexbiotech.com ) control panel room ( inside module EU-150 ) ass effect wavelength light alertness , performance , subsequent sleep , preparation deploy light countermeasure long duration simulation include 24.65-hour Martian sol . Subjects randomize three light condition use balanced Latin square design . Specific aim 4 . Test hypothesis alertness , performance mood external mission controller impair final third extend duration , 24-hour work shift compare first third work shift . We anticipate acute total sleep deprivation circadian misalignment associate hour 16 24 work shift significantly degrade alertness , performance mood . Specific aim 5 . Test hypothesis alertness , performance mood external mission controller expose short wavelength light ( peak wavelength 485 525 nm ) final third extend duration work shift significantly well alertness , performance mood crewmembers expose intermediate wavelength light ( peak wavelength either 545 nm 555 nm ) longer wavelength light ( 620 nm 690 nm ) final third extend duration work shift . The purpose propose study address five specific hypothesis aim validate method collect data monitor performance , sleep circadian rhythm operational environment . We also plan evaluate efficacy photic countermeasure design improve alertness , performance , mood acute circadian misalignment 105-day mission crewmembers require duty console monitoring room night shift every sixth night . These five hypothesis base result preliminary data indicate : ( ) night shift worker invert normal sleep/wake schedule experience sleep loss , decreased alertness performance ; ( b ) individual work extend duration , 24-hour shift experience sleep loss impaired alertness , performance mood , especially critical zone vulnerability 16th 24th hour extend duration work shift ; ( c ) short wavelength light acutely suppress melatonin increase alertness , performance mood night work ; ( ) short wavelength visible light effective intermediate longer wavelength light suppress melatonin increase alertness , performance mood night .</detailed_description>
