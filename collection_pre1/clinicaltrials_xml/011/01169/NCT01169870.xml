	<brief_title>Genexol-PM Versus Paclitaxel Anthracycline-pretreated Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , two-armed , parallel group , randomize phase II study evaluation Genexol-PM paclitaxel . Up 42 eligible patient enrol treatment arm ( total 84 ) accord trial design . Patients randomly allocate arm A ( Genexol-PM ) arm B ( Paclitaxel ) . They stratify ER status ( positive v negative ) , performance ( ECOG 0 1 v 2 ) , prior adjuvant taxane ( v yes ) The treatment continue 6 cycle , discontinue 6th cycle iin case disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , patient withdrawal . After discontinuation study therapy , patient proceed post-therapy follow-up phase study . Patients may enrol study document measurable disease . Response document physical examination prior treatment cycle CT scan every two cycle disease progression suspect . Responses assess unidimensionally accord RECIST . All partial complete response require confirmation second evaluation least 4 week follow first documentation response . All toxicity encounter study evaluate cycle use NCI CTC ( National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ) version 3.0 scale . For peripheral neuropathy , scale Table 4 use determine dose adjustment . Life-threatening toxicity report immediately Study Chairman .</detailed_description>
