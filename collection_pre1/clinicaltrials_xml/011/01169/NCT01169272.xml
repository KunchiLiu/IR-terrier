	<brief_summary>Sorin Group develop new atrial lead evaluation study . The SonR atrial lead present new sensor tip lead allow new feature ; interventricular ( VV ) atrioventricular ( AV ) delay ( VVD AVD ) optimization . The new RV autothreshold algorithm implement CRT-ICD help physician diagnosis avoid potential lose capture . The ICD device also capability remotely interrogated remote monitor system whose performance report study . Finally , study report electrical handle performance new leave ventricular lead .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , sponsor aim : - Demonstrating safety atrial SonR lead ; - Demonstrating performance right ventricular autothreshold algorithm ; - Reporting adverse event document study ; - Reporting electrical performance Sorin Group PARADYM ICD , order validate performance device conformance longevity effectiveness objective ; - Reporting Sorin atrial SonR Situs 2 MV leave ventricular lead performance ; - Reporting SonR atrial lead mechanical handling . - Reporting information SonR sensor validate SonR data exploitation AVD/VVD optimization . - Reporting Situs 2 MV LV lead mechanical handling . - Assessing user satisfaction ( patient physician ) remote monitor solution overall availability system term data . Thus , study intend show PARADYM RF ICD operate safely appropriately intended-use part ICD system .</detailed_description>
