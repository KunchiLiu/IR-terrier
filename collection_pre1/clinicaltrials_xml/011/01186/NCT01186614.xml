	<brief_summary>Sudden out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) lead cause death Australia . The common cause OHCA heart attack . The current treatment OHCA resuscitation ambulance paramedic involve CPR , electrical shock heart , injection adrenaline . In 50 % case , paramedic unable start heart patient declare dead scene . Patients OHCA respond paramedic resuscitation routinely transport hospital hazardous paramedic undertake rapid transport whilst administer chest compression currently additional therapy available hospital would assist start heart . However , number recent development suggest may new approach resuscitation group patient would otherwise die . Firstly , Ambulance Victoria recently introduce portable battery power machine allow chest compression safely effectively deliver emergency ambulance transport . Second , The Alfred ICU shortly implement new protocol whereby patient cardiac arrest immediately place heart-lung machine . This know extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) . Third , brain much well protected damage due lack blood flow use therapeutic hypothermia control lower body temperature 37°C 33°C . Clinical trial demonstrate significantly decrease brain damage OHCA . Finally , The Alfred Cardiology service emergency service reopen block artery heart patient present sudden blockage heart arteries . This currently use patient without heart beat technical difficulty undertaking procedure chest compression undertaken . This study propose first time implement intervention patient fail standard resuscitation OHCA . When standard resuscitation prove futile , patient transport The Alfred mechanical chest compression device , cool 33°C , place ECMO , transport interventional cardiac catheter laboratory . The patient receive therapeutic hypothermia 24 hour . Subsequent management follow standard treatment guideline The Alfred Intensive Care Unit .</brief_summary>
