	<detailed_description>Background . Reducing cigarette smoking among adult major public health objective . Although target prevalence adult smoke &lt; 12 % 2010 ( DHHS 2000 ) , current estimate indicate 20.8 % , 45.3 million adult , currently smoke ( CDC , 2007 ) . An estimated 44.2 % smoker try quit least one day last 12 month ( CDC , 2007 ) , yet &lt; 10 % smoker try quit remain abstinent ( Benowitz , 2008 ) . Even intensive treatment , 11-20 % smoker abstinent 6 month ( Sutherland , 2003 ) . Smoking also result enormous economic burden , health-care lose productivity cost total approximately $ 167 billion per year ( CDC , 2008 ) . A limitation current treatment guideline lack specificity individual smoker . Completion sequence human genome current focus genomics ( Collins , Green , Guttmacher , &amp; Guyer , 2003 ) provide unprecedented opportunity study biobehavioral factor influence smoking . This research contribute individualize treatment provide well understanding effect genetic , psychological , environmental factor interaction smoke initiation , maintenance , cessation , relapse ( Lerman , Schnoll &amp; Munafo , 2007 ; Morgan et al. , 2003 ; Swan et al. , 2003 ) . Both candidate gene study identify specific gene affect smoke pharmacogenomic study investigate effect select gene treatment response contribute grow body knowledge genetic influence smoking . The anticipated outcome study ability individualize type , dose , duration treatment base smoker ' genotype ( Lerman , Schnoll &amp; Munafo ) . Ultimately , long-term goal research decrease relapse promote sustain abstinence . The Genetic Education Smoking Model provide framework investigate variable potentially influence way smoker respond information : ( ) genetic contribution smoking ( b ) potential genetically-informed cessation treatment . Based social-cognitive theory Common Sense Model ( CSM ) ( Cervone , 2004 ; Brownlee , Leventhal , &amp; Leventhal , 2000 ) , Genetic Education Smoking Model propose genetic education influence smoker ' mental representation appraisal genetics smoke addition smoking-related behavior affective response . As genetically-informed cessation treatment become part research clinical care , smoker need degree genetic literacy make inform decision ( McInerney , 2002 ; Shields , Lerman , &amp; Sullivan , 2004 ) . There grow body scientific knowledge guide educational program genetic contribution smoke potential genetically-informed cessation treatment . Epidemiologic twin study consistently support genetic cause smoking , estimate 56 % variance smoking initiation 67 % progression nicotine dependence due additive genetic effect ( Sullivan Kendler , 1999 ) . Findings several genome-wide scan use linkage analysis identify chromosome 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 21 contain possible susceptibility loci smoking-related gene ( Li , Cheng , Ma , &amp; Swan , 2003 ; Li , Ma , &amp; Beuten , 2004 ) . Several candidate-genes smoke heritability identify , include nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChRs ) , dopamine receptor ( DRD2 DRD4 ) transporter ( SLC6A3 ) gene , catechol-o-methyl-transferase ( COMT ) gene , mu opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) gene , serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) gene ( Lerman , Schnoll , &amp; Munafo , 2007 ; Schnoll , Johnson , &amp; Lerman , 2007 ) . Polymorphisms CYP2A6 , cytochrome P450 enzyme , play major role inactivation nicotine metabolite , cotinine ( Messina , Tyndale , &amp; Sellers , 1997 ; Benowitz , 2008 ) . Specific Aims . The primary specific aim compare effect experimental group attention control group smoking-related mental representation , appraisal , behavior , affective response time . The primary aim achieve use randomize , longitudinal , two-group repeat measure design determine direct effect intervention smoking-related mental representation , appraisal , behavior , affective response . The secondary aim explore whether personality characteristic ( trait negative affectivity curiosity ) educational level moderate effect genetic educational program smoking-related mental representation , appraisal , behavior , affective response . The secondary aim achieve multiple logistic regression determine whether personality traits educational level moderate effect intervention identify smoking-related outcome . Methods . Participants assign randomly either experimental attention control group . The group balance gender number cigarette smoke per day use stratify randomization ( Friedman , Furberg , &amp; DeMets , 1996 ) . Age baseline data major study variable treat covariates . The experimental group , refer Genetic Education Session ( GES ) group , receive education two smoking-related genotype , DRD2 CYP2A6 . The content GES session one basic genetics include concept terminology , impact Human Genome Project health-care use genetic counseling testing . The content GES session two research smoking genetics . The content focus multifactorial nature smoking ; research finding genetic contribution smoking , specifically candidate genotype DRD2 CYP2A6 ; potential application research cessation treatment , include legal , ethical social implication genotyping . To control attention placebo effect ( Meltzoff , 1998 ) , control group receive information nutritional guideline establish USDA FDA . The attention control group refer Nutritional Education Session ( NES ) group . The content NES session one two aim understand use dietary food safety guideline . Following genetic nutritional education session , group receive standard cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation intervention NRT form transdermal nicotine ( TN ) patch . This intervention refer standard smoking cessation ( SSC ) session . SSC content focus : ( ) nature nicotine addiction ; ( b ) use self-change strategy form self-monitoring , stimulus identification control , stress management , relapse prevention ; ( 3 ) use nicotine replacement manage crave withdrawal symptom . The SSC session consist four 2-hour group counsel session one follow-up telephone call last session . The intervention occur 5-week period GES NES . Participants receive 6-week supply TN patch follow dosage : 21 mg/24hours 4 week 14 mg/24 hour 2 week ( Fiore Jaen , Baker al. , 2008 ) . A 1-week supply patch distribute SSC session 2-3 2-week supply distribute session 4 . The final two week free TN 14 mg/24hours strength mail participant ' home week 7 . Participants encourage purchase two-week supply 7 mg/24hours patch final two week 8-week course TN . They also option use combination therapy recommend 2008 guideline , augment TN NRT ( gum , spray , inhaler ) bupropion SR . This option explain time obtain inform consent participant visit primary care provider obtain prescription medication ( nicotine spray inhaler bupropion SR ) prior SSC . Data collect use TN alone recommend combination . Expired air CO measurement conduct Session feedback/motivation participant . Session 1 CO measurement use baseline CO data . Data Collection . Data collection form self report questionnaire occur four time point , Time 1 Time 4 ( T1-T4 ) . Baseline data collection ( T1 ) follow randomization experimental control group . T2 data collect two part ( T2a &amp; b ) obtain initial post-intervention data variable pertain session : T2a occur end education session ( GES NES ) T2b occur end SSC session ( i.e. , 6 week ) . T2a Questionnaires distributed end session return start SSC ( Week 3 ) . T2b questionnaires distributed end SSC . Questionnaires return postage-paid mail Week 8 . If need , participant remind follow-up telephone session . Two additional data collection ( T3-T4 ) occur twelve week 6 month end SSC . T3-T4 data consist self-report questionnaire in-person measurement expire air CO salivary cotinine verification abstinence participant use NRT whose CO measurement &lt; 8-10 ppm ( Benowitz et al. , 2002 ) . Data Analysis . Preliminary analysis dependent variable include frequency distribution look outlier , descriptive statistic plot assess normality , bivariate scatterplots evaluate linearity relationship among study variable . Statistical method deal nonnormality , transformation raw data , may employ prior analysis . For scale , internal consistency reliability coefficient estimate . All primary analysis base intent-to-treat paradigm . Each participant 's data analyze accord randomized assignment , regardless whether complete intervention session . The analysis plan carry order work methodological issue , fully power study , significant finding expect .05 level . A liberal level .10 use significance test , emphasis place descriptive statistic estimate effect size . For Aim 1 , primary endpoint mean change time relative baseline compare experimental control group use Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) methodology ( Laing &amp; Zeger , 1986 ) . A model fit incorporating term test effect intervention time , covarying baseline value , age , amount smoke . An interaction term also include test whether rate change time group . If difficulty occur implement GEE relatively small number cohort per group pilot study , model may simplify cross-sectional analysis individual nest within cohort time point . For Aim 2 , multiple logistic regression use predict outcome variable independent variable test moderation conduct accord procedure describe Baron &amp; Kenny ( 1986 ) .</detailed_description>
