	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect 3 different approach exercise train woman early stage breast cancer complete primary treatment ( except hormone therapy , appropriate ) . Prior research woman early stage breast cancer show treatment may adverse impact physical fitness level lead feeling fatigue poor quality life . Supervised exercise train show reduce side-effects . However , exercise program follow essentially approach . This study design see different approach exercise training effective conventional approach currently use .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Aged 4580 year Female Has diagnose earlystage breast cancer Postmenopausal , define : Age ≥ 45 menses least 2 year An interval least one year , five year , follow full completion primary therapy malignant disease . Primary therapy define : Surgery plus radiation Surgery plus chemotherapy Surgery plus trastuzumab Surgery plus hormone therapy Note : For patient receive hormone therapy follow surgery , definition oneyear postcompletion therapy define surgery date . Patients currently receive hormone therapy eligible enrollment . Weight &lt; 205 kg ECOG status 0 1 Life expectancy ≥ 6 month Performing less 150 minute structure moderateintensity strenuous intensity exercise per week . Exercise intolerance define VO2peak predict sedentary age sexmatched individual define Appendix H. Willing randomize one study arm Able complete acceptable baseline CPET , absence high risk ECG finding inappropriate response exercise determine investigator . Able achieve acceptable peak baseline CPET , define follow criterion : Achieving plateau oxygen consumption , concurrent increase power output ; A respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10 ; Attainment maximal predict heart rate ( HRmax ) ( i.e. , within 10 bpm agepredicted HRmax [ HRmax = 220Age [ year ] ) ; Volitional exhaustion , measure rating perceive exertion ( RPE ) ≥ 18 BORG scale . Any following absolute contraindication cardiopulmonary exercise testing : Acute myocardial infarction within 35 day plan study procedure ; Unstable angina ; Uncontrolled arrhythmia cause symptom hemodynamic compromise ; Recurrent syncope ; Active endocarditis ; Acute myocarditis pericarditis ; Symptomatic severe aortic stenosis ; Uncontrolled heart failure ; Acute pulmonary embolus pulmonary infarction within 3 month plan study procedure Thrombosis low extremity ; Suspected dissect aneurysm ; Uncontrolled asthma ; Pulmonary edema ; Respiratory failure ; Acute noncardiopulmonary disorder may affect exercise performance aggravate exercise ( i.e. , infection , renal failure , thyrotoxicosis ) ; Presence concurrent , actively treated malignancy History malignancy treat within past 3 year ( nonmelanoma skin cancer ) Presence metastatic disease Room air desaturation rest ≤ 85 % Mental impairment lead inability cooperate Any condition intercurrent illness , opinion investigator , make participant poor candidate trial</criteria>
