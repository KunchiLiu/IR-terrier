	<brief_summary>In order examine potential gender difference weight loss response exercise , investigator propose compare equal energy expenditure exercise overweight men woman use level exercise energy expenditure investigator previously show prevent weight gain promote weight loss . The investigator randomize men woman exercise group , 5 days/week , 9 month , energy expenditure 400 kcal/exercise session , group 600 kcal/ exercise session , control group . 1 ) The investigator hypothesize men woman randomize sedentary control gain weight , randomize 400 kcal/exercise session maintain weight ( gain ) , randomize 600 kcal/exercise session lose ~5 % body weight . 2 ) The investigator hypothesize difference weight loss gender either 400 600 kcal energy expenditure exercise since men woman equal amount energy expenditure exercise . 3 ) The investigator hypothesize men woman randomize 400 kcal/exercise session completely compensate energy expend exercise alter energy intake and/or spontaneous activity men woman participant randomize 600 kcal/exercise session completely compensate . The investigator believe finding study could important implication exercise guideline weight loss .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exercise recommend virtually every public health organization ; however , role exercise generally consider secondary energy restriction treatment obesity . Indeed , argument make suggests exercise effective weight loss . Meta-analytic study consistently find small amount weight loss due exercise without energy restriction . It critical note actually randomize controlled trial use exercise alone weight loss . We believe 3 critical flaw vast majority literature . 1 ) Participants supervise generally record self report likely poorly estimate general , overestimate . 2 ) The amount exercise use usually prescribe guideline recommend level physical fitness diminish cardiovascular disease , amount may necessary weight loss . 3 ) The energy expenditure exercise rarely report . Participants randomly assign expend either 400 600kcal per exercise session ( control group ) exercise 5 day per week 9 month . All exercise session supervise length exercise session base upon energy expenditure ( kcal/min ) give heart rate range . To account improvement fitness , energy expenditure measure monthly adjustment daily exercise prescription alter accordingly .</detailed_description>
