	<brief_summary>The purpose project quantify 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) cervical motion pattern change result osteopathic manipulation treatment ( OMT ) experimental subject group diagnose somatic dysfunction . The kinematic data include entire 3-D motion trajectory head , result range motion ( ROM ) angular data primary secondary motion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our primary hypothesis kinematic change detect OMT motion primary direction passive diagnostic test motion ( cervical side-bending right left ) , well angular rotation ( deviation ) occur around motion . Our secondary hypothesis examination kinematic data provide objective inter- intra-examiner data ass similarities/differences occur passive clinical exam OMT . Lastly , hypothesize significant difference kinematic pattern result two subject group . This experiment design follow clinical biomechanical observation : - comparison diagnostic data three osteopathic physician , - comparison within-subject kinematic profile pre- post-treatment , - inter-examiner comparison kinematic motion path occur diagnostic motion , - evaluate kinematic pattern two subject group , assess group similarities/differences , - evaluate diagnostic kinematic data relative VAS , cervical disability , health status information , SNF , - re-classify aspect kinematic data use cluster ( statistical ) analysis procedure compare initial secondary physician diagnostic data , - ass stability change make OMT procedure kinematic response three day post-treatment .</detailed_description>
