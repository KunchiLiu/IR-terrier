	<brief_summary>Inactivity excess energy consumption lead cause obesity type 2 diabetes associate increase cardio-metabolic risk . In order reduce cardiovascular risk associate type 2 diabetes , Canadian Diabetes Association guideline ( 2008 ) recommend weight loss caloric restriction structure physical activity . However , comparative effect different method obtain caloric deficit weight loss remain elucidate . The main objective study assess impact two strategy caloric deficit : diet alone diet exercise total fat mass , epicardial fat cardiovascular risk factor overweight obese adult type 2 diabetes high risk cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mainly cause excess body weight due lack physical activity high amount calorie consumption . Individuals type 2 diabetes demonstrate increase risk cardiovascular disease compare non diabetic . Studies show cardiovascular risk reduction weight loss among individual risk lifestyle modification : increase physical activity low calorie diet . Favourable effect weight loss cardiovascular risk mainly due total body fat reduction . However , location body fat excess also important implication . It well know abdominal ( visceral ) ectopic fat accumulation ( e.g . hepatic fat , epicardial fat , etc . ) relate unfavorable cardio-metabolic profile total fat mass . It demonstrate moderate weight loss obtain physical activity caloric restriction relate significant reduction ectopic fat mass . However , ectopic fat measurement remain problematic due lack standardization safety issue ( X-ray ) . Epicardial fat thickness measure simple echocardiography reliable method evaluate ectopic fat accumulation . Little research do assess effect different method weight loss total fat well ectopic fat specifically epicardial adipose tissue among individual type 2 diabetes . The objective study compare control group detail advice impact two structured strategy caloric deficit : diet alone diet exercise total fat mass , epicardial fat cardiovascular risk factor overweight obese adult type 2 diabetes high risk cardiovascular disease . The participant present study free-living adult overweight obese type 2 diabetes high risk cardiovascular disease determine Framingham risk score 15 % presence two cardiovascular risk factor . Participants attend screen study visit confirm eligibility criterion ( anthropometric variable , blood pressure , complete physical examination , coronary heart disease diagnostic echocardiogram , physical activity aptitude ) . After enrollment , baseline visit consist series data collection : anthropometric variable , blood pressure , cycle ergometer test evaluate cardiovascular fitness , echocardiography determine epicardial fat thickness , dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan ass body fat , lean mass bone density , indirect calorimetry rest metabolic rate , physical activity profile total energy expenditure determine Sense Wear Armband ( SWA ) accelerometer ( 7days ) , food consumption estimate 3 day dairy , questionnaires address sociodemographic psychosocial characteristic , diabetes self-care ( SDCA questionnaire ) , blood urine collection diabetes control , hepatic steatosis biochemical score , detailed lipid , hormonal inflammatory profile finally microalbuminuria . The body composition also measure impedancemetry BOD-POD . Participants randomly assign one three group study : Group 1 : Counseling physical activity healthy eat Group 2 : Structured diet intervention ( caloric restriction ) counsel physical activity Group 3 : Structured diet intervention ( caloric restriction ) structure exercise training program ( aerobic resistance training ) . Group 1 : participant attend one visit dietician ( 30mn ) physical activity specialist ( 30mn ) give Canadian guideline pamphlet physical activity food consumption . They also receive phone call month discus issue guideline follow . Group 2 : participant attend one visit physical activity specialist ( 30mn ) receive physical activity guideline . Monthly phone call make discus issue physical activity guideline follow . These individual also enrol supervised caloric restriction program . They visit dietician week first month twice month 3 month . The diet intervention focus low fat diet . At session participant weigh take blood pressure . Group 3 : participant attend diet intervention describe group 2 . They also follow supervised exercise program three day per week 4 month . The exercise training interval high intensity aerobic ( 85-90 % Heart rate reserve ) program resistance exercise ( 15RM , 2-3 repetition ) . Each session last one hour . At end month 1 , 2 , 3 , participant receive SWA armband 7 day record physical activity estimate energy expenditure . At end Month 4 , participant attend study visit repeat baseline testing .</detailed_description>
