	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate safety two dos FBS0701 , new oral iron chelator , effectiveness clearing iron liver . FBS0701 medication take mouth cause body get rid iron . Iron chelators use patient β-thalassemia form anemia experience iron overload - iron increase body result regularly require blood transfusion . Patients qualify randomize receive one two dos FBS0701 24 week ( 6 month ) total study duration 33 week . These patient eligible participate dose extension 72 week . The maximum duration dose 96 week . The safety patient monitor frequently study physical exam , ECGs , blood test . To assess amount iron liver heart , patient must undergo 6 MRI scan study . Patients need stay hospital study need visit outpatient clinic 28 time 96 week period . Patients currently take iron chelator require stop total 26 week . The result study help determine FBS0701 may effective iron chelator .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Transfusional iron overload due : hereditary anemia sickle cell disease , βthalassemia DiamondBlackfan anemia ; acquire anemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome form bone marrow failure . Patients must also transfusiondependent require chronic treatment deferoxamine , deferasirox , and/or deferiprone . Willing discontinue exist iron chelation therapy throughout study period . Serum ferritin great 500 ng/mL Screening . Baseline liver iron concentration cardiac MRI T2* per protocol requirement . Mean previous three pretransfusion hemoglobin concentration great equal 7.5 g/dL . Agrees use approve method contraception throughout study period . As result medical review , physical examination Screening investigation , Principal Investigator consider patient unfit study . Nonelective hospitalization within 30 day prior Baseline test . ( Patients sickle cell anemia admit hospital management sickle crisis pain whose uncomplicated hospital course four day less , 14 day prior Baseline testing , return previous health status acceptable . ) Evidence clinically relevant oral , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , neurologic , psychiatric , immunologic , bone marrow skin disorder determine Investigator . Evidence significant renal insufficiency ; possible example include : serum creatinine upper limit normal , proteinuria great 2 gm per day calculate creatinine clearance le 60 mL/minute . Cardiac leave ventricular ejection fraction outside protocol requirement . Known sensitivity magnesium stearate , croscarmellose sodium FBS0701 . Platelet count 100,000/µL and/or absolute neutrophil count le 1500/mm3 Screening &lt; 50 % Baseline test MRI Alkaline phosphatase , AST ALT outside protocol requirement . Liver Function Tests : ALT &gt; 5 time local upper limit normal two occasion previous 12 month ALT Screening &gt; 200 IU/L Use investigational agent within 30 day prior Baseline testing .</criteria>
