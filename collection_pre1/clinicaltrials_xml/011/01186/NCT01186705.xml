	<brief_summary>The purpose study test new drug call MK-2206 metastatic colorectal cancer . This drug test subgroup patient colorectal cancer whose tumor change certain gene may make likely respond new medication . As tumor develop , cell within tumor acquire mutation within gene , allow grow effectively . We test tumor mutation involve two gene - KRAS PIK3CA . Patients whose tumor normal copy KRAS gene mutation within PIK3CA gene eligible participate study . This study phase 2 study . The goal phase 2 study find effect , good and/or bad , new treatment certain type cancer .</brief_summary>
