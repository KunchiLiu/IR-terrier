	<brief_summary>This proposal outline investigator plan develop , evaluate implement accelerate hospital community rehabilitation follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) lead outpatient TKA . The benefit apply current concept improve postoperative analgesia less invasive surgical technique expect improve objective parameter knee function , increase patient satisfaction , reduce health care resource requirement compare standard rehabilitation . The innovation combine best practice orthopaedic sport medicine , Anesthesia , Physiotherapy Knee reconstruction expect realize goal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Outpatient Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consecutive patient present elective TKA General ( Dr. Dervin ) approach enrollment . Dr Dervin present study patient appropriate study first confirm joint replacement clinic assessment . If patient indicate interested , surgeon inform research coordinator continue consent process . The research coordinator confirm patient 's eligibility ensure inclusion exclusion criterion meet . The study explain detail qualify patient provide copy consent form . The consent form also provide clause confidentiality inform patient privacy . All question answer . Patients may also talk investigator additional question . Patients advise preoperatively accelerate path hospital share many attribute standard TOH care map , several addition , choose help reduce pain hemarthrosis , felt major impediment faster recuperation . 1 . Surgery perform muscle spar subvastus approach , chosen evidence decreased pain . 2 . Tranexamic acid ( 10 mg/kg ) intravenously administer reduce blood loss time tourniquet deflation . 3 . The `` Game Ready '' cold - compression device use post operatively help reduce pain minimize swelling . Timeline : Outcome data collection expect complete July 1 , 2018 allow minimum 6 month follow . Outcomes ( Metrics ) : The outcome measure provide summarize . 1 . Length stay : We measure LOS patient compare cohort comparable demographic treat concurrently service 2 . Analgesic use hospital home ( pt maintain 28 day pain diary record analgesic take quality life recovery question ) capture special interest opioid spar effect 3 . Physiotherapy measure Physical parameter range motion quadriceps strength stay discharge , 2 week , 1 , 2 3 month 4 . Patient satisfaction questionnaire outcome : 6 month evaluate 5 . Health care resource requirement 1 . Physiotherapy visit 2 . Use mobility aid duration 6 . Time return work applicable Benefits patient The benefit patient substantial improve pace recovery le physical burden quicker achievement goal resumption normal activity .</detailed_description>
