	<brief_title>A Study Canagliflozin Study Participants With Various Degrees Impaired Hepatic ( Liver ) Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( study participant investigator know name assign treatment ) , pharmacokinetic ( study drug absorb body , distribute within body , remove body time ) study canagliflozin adult study participant mild moderate hepatic ( liver ) impairment compare study participant normal hepatic function . Approximately 24 study participant meet entry criterion study classify 1 3 hepatic function group : Group 1 ( 8 study participant normal hepatic function ) , Group 2 ( 8 study participant mild hepatic impairment ) Group 3 ( 8 study participant moderate hepatic impairment ) . The group allocation base Child-Pugh score , assessment 5 clinical measure use characterize degree hepatic impairment . At least 3 men 3 woman enrol group 3 group balance respect average age body weight . Study participant require stay overnight study center 5 night receive study drug study procedure safety assessment perform . All study participant administer single 300-mg oral ( mouth ) dose canagliflozin fasting ( eat food ) period least 10 hour . After study drug administration , study participant provide standardized meal ( breakfast , lunch , dinner ) . Blood urine sample analyse canagliflozin metabolite ( M7 M5 ) collect study participant specify time point 120 hour ( blood ) 48 hour ( urine ) study drug administration . After discharge study center , study participant require return study center 3 outpatient visit study procedure safety assessment perform . Study participant monitor safety study evaluate adverse event report result clinical laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement , physical examination . On Day 1 study , single 300 mg dose canagliflozin orally administer study participant fast period least 10 hour follow 10 minute later standardize breakfast must eat within 30 minute . Study participant remain stand sit first 4 hour dose . At 2 hour dose ( earlier ) study participant must drink 1 glass water ; drinking water allow onwards .</detailed_description>
