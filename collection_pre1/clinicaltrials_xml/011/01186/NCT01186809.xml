	<brief_summary>The purpose Phase IIA study : 1. define safety profile 2. evaluate efficacy sequential infusion unmanipulated Donor Lymphocyte Infusions ( DLI ) Cytokine Induced Killer ( CIK ) cell treatment molecular , cytogenetic hematologic relapse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation The progression free survival overall survival sequential infusion Donor Lymphocyte Infusions ( DLI ) Cytokine Induced Killer ( CIK ) cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytokine Induced Killer ( CIK ) Cells In Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label , multicenter , exploratory phase IIA study evaluate safety ( dose-finding ) efficacy sequential administration donor derive unmanipulated DLI vitro expand Cytokine Induced Killer ( CIK ) cell . Two infusion unmanipulated donor lymphocyte ( 1x106/Kg ) give minimum interval 3 week . Three infusion donor Cytokine Induced Killer ( CIK ) cell administer accord dose escalate program , start 3 week second Donor Lymphocyte Infusions ( DLI ) . In presence grade 2 acute graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , patient receive next scheduled infusion . Only grade 4 acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) consider dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . Once identify maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) , combination dos administer 24 patient two-stage minimax design . Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint Phase IIA study : 1. Maximally Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) - ( safety end-point ) 2. cumulative incidence molecular , karyotypic haematologic response day +100 end cell therapy program - ( efficacy end-point ) Secondary Endpoints Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) define evidence molecular , cytogenetic haematologic disease progression . Cytogenetic and/or molecular relapse define available evidence pre-transplant defined abnormality use conventional cytogenetics FISH technique molecular probe . Assessments perform 1 year end cell therapy program Overall Survival ( OS ) The Overall Survival ( OS ) assess 1 year end cell therapy program . For assessment Overall Survival ( OS ) , event deaths cause , patient censor alive .</detailed_description>
