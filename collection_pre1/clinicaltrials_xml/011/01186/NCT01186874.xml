	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury critical illness syndrome consist acute hypoxemic respiratory failure bilateral pulmonary infiltrates attribute left atrial hypertension . The severity hypoxemia differentiate two entity , ratio partial pressure oxygen arterial blood ( PaO2 ) inspire fraction oxygen ( FIO2 ) less 200 mm Hg ARDS le 300 mm Hg ALI . [ 1 ] Although ARDS initially report 1967 Ashbaugh colleague [ 2 ] , 1992 American-European Consensus Conference ( AECC ) ARDS develop standardize definition ARDS ALI . There many epidemiologic research incidence mortality ALI/ARDS . [ 3-6 ] Gorden D [ 3 ] report total 1113 King County resident undergo mechanical ventilation meet criterion acute lung injury 15 year age old . On basis figure , crude incidence acute lung injury 78.9 per 100,000 person-years age-adjusted incidence 86.2 per 100,000 person-years . The in-hospital mortality rate 38.5 percent . In country , Yueming Lu [ 7 ] report in-hospital 90-day mortality ARDS patient 68.5 70.4 % Shanghai ICU 2004 . In recent year , significant progress make diagnosis treatment ALI/ARDS , application lung protective ventilation strategy CRRT , may prove symptom prognosis ALI/ARDS . However , controversy still remain . Ventilation drive pressure , early application neuromuscular blockade , strategy PEEP level frequently meet question routine practice . In country , guideline treatment diagnosis ALI/ARDS develop 2006 [ 8 ] . So incidence mortality disease unknown country . Therefore , investigator perform prospective , multi-center study survey incidence , risk factor outcome ALI/ARDS 13 adult ICU Shanghai .</detailed_description>
