	<brief_title>A Relative Bioavailability Study Rabeprazole Sodium Administered With Different Dosing Vehicles Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( volunteer investigator know name assign treatment ) single center study evaluate bioavailability ( rate extent absorption ) safety different dose vehicle use administer pediatric formulation rabeprazole sodium healthy adult volunteer . A dose vehicle food liquid mixed rabeprazole sodium oral ( mouth ) administration . Approximately 35 healthy adult volunteer enrol randomize ( assigned chance ) 1 5 possible treatment sequence receive follow single-dose treatment : 1 ) content rabeprazole sprinkle capsule mixed strawberry-flavored vehicle suspension ( Treatment A ) , 2 ) content rabeprazole sprinkle capsule sprinkle 1 tablespoon plain yogurt ( Treatment B ) , 3 ) content rabeprazole sprinkle capsule sprinkle 1 tablespoon applesauce ( Treatment C ) , 4 ) content rabeprazole sprinkle capsule mix 5 mL ( 1 teaspoon ) formula milk ( Treatment D ) , 5 ) content rabeprazole sprinkle capsule mixed tablet vehicle suspension ( Treatment E ) . Each volunteer receive 5 single-dose treatment study ( 1 single-dose treatment treatment period ) . A period least 7 day separate treatment period . During treatment period , volunteer require stay overnight study center 12 hour study drug administration approximately 24 hour study drug administration study procedure perform blood sample collect measure concentration rabeprazole thioether metabolite ( substance produce rabeprazole absorbed body ) . Volunteers fast ( withhold eating food ) least 10 hour study drug administration least 4 hour study drug administration . On dose day , volunteer receive morning meal allow drink non-carbonated water 2 hour study drug administration . After dose , standard lunch , snack , dinner provide volunteer . Each volunteer participate study approximately 55 day monitor safety study evaluate adverse event report result clinical laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement , physical examination . On Day 1 treatment period , volunteer administer content 2 capsule equivalent 10 mg rabeprazole sodium mixed strawberry-flavored vehicle reconstitute water vehicle tablet reconstitute water ( Treatments A E , respectively ) 10 mg rabeprazole sodium sprinkle 1 tablespoon plain yogurt applesauce ( Treatments B C , respectively ) , 10 mg rabeprazole sodium mix 5 mL formula milk ( Treatment D ) .</detailed_description>
