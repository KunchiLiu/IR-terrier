	<brief_summary>The project data relate burden spinal cord injury induce limb paralysis India quite alarm . This attribute rapid industrialization economical development country . Increase vehicular traffic cause numerous road traffic accident . Rapid increase population , development computer technology real estate business lead construction huge building indirectly add injury due fall . Spinal cord injury could treat adequately prevail treatment modality . In view , definitely urgent need find different method treatment patient undergo establish modality treatment try unsuccessfully . Since large number patient loose productive life prime life , one alternate therapy , seem offer promise , `` stem cell '' therapy , well study publish prestigious journal . In present study , want evaluate safety efficacy autologous bone marrow derive stem cell surgically transplant directly lesion site glial scar resection 8 indian patient chronic spinal cord injury intra-thecal injection 4 indian patient acute subacute injury .</brief_summary>
