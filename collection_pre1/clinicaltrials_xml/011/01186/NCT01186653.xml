	<brief_title>Effect Adrenal Function Budesonide Versus Fluticasone Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background COPD common disease chronic progressive . Current NICE guideline recommend use inhale steroid relatively high dose patient moderate severe disease two exacerbation require treatment antibiotic oral steroid 12 month period.The aim treatment reduce exacerbation rate slow decline health status . None inhaled steroid currently available license use alone treatment COPD . They prescribe combination long act beta 2 agonist ( LABA , medication lead dilatation airway ) , effective combination . The combination LABA inhale steroid preparation available include Symbicort® ( contain budesonide formoterol fumarate Seretide® ( contain fluticasone propionate salmeterol xinafoate ) . Symbicort® evaluate randomize controlled patient COPD find beneficial compare either component alone . Similar data available Seretide® well . There large trial directly compare two different preparation quite often choice two make rather empirically . Although inhaled steroid good safety profile low dos , dose use preparation use COPD high get potential adverse effect adrenal ( gland body secretes steroid ) suppression . Studies show marked adrenal suppression occur high dose inhale steroids.However dos use various study different study asthmatic group patient , response may different COPD . The effect adrenal function assess simple analysis overnight urine sample collection . It difficult decide treatment choose initiation therapy . We wish compare adrenal suppression two treatment determine whether difference , could influence decision treatment specific patient group consider risk adverse effect . Study design This study conduct single centre . The investigator responsible study . The study design 8 week study patient cross one arm study group another . Patients COPD current treatment either Symbicort® Seretide® dose per NICE guideline include . The treatment dose Symbicort® ( budesonide / formoterol , 400 micrograms/9 microgram ) one puff bd Seretide® ( fluticasone/salmeterol , 250 micrograms/25 microgram ) two puff bd . We plan include 30 patient either current treatment Symbicort® Seretide® . On visit 1 : Patients would either treatment high dose Symbicort® OR Seretide® ( treatment at−least four week ) . The patient re−trained correct use current inhaler re−educated often take medication . The patient guide take treatment indicated 4weeks , end 4 week treatment ask collect overnight ( 12 hr ) urine sample ( 21:00 hrs−09:00hrs ) . The patient return clinic visit 2 return urine sample quality life previous 4 week assess mean modify St Georges Respiratory questionnaire . If patient treatment Symbicort® switch Seretide® vice−versa . The patient see 4 week later visit 3 . A bottle collecting overnight ( 12 hour ) urine sample give patient urine collection end 4 week treatment period . On visit 3 : patient return overnight urine sample The quality life patient previous 4 week assess use modify St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire .</detailed_description>

Patients concomitant disease may interfere study procedure evaluation . ( self explanatory ) A recent exacerbation COPD within last 8 week . ( interfere assessment ) Use oral steroid within last 2 month . ( interfere assessment ) Use ocular , intra−articular , rectal steroid 4 week prior inclusion . ( interfere assessment ) Participation study ( use investigational product ) within 4 week prior inclusion . ( potential interfere assessment ) Alcohol drug abuse .
