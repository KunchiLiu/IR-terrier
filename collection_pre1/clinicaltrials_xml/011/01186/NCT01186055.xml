	<brief_title>Brain Activity Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our previous work demonstrate , among non-treatment seek smoker , regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) increase follow 14 hour overnight abstinence , compare smoke usual . Specifically , increase rCBF observe anterior cingulate , medial leave orbitofrontal cortex . Two smoking urge item ( `` craving cigarette '' `` urge smoke time '' ) predict relapse strongly correlate CBF increase several region comprise brain 's reward visual circuitry ( Wang et al. , 2007 ) . In addition , two study group use BOLD fMRI show smoker genotype associate smoke relapse exhibit reduction BOLD signal bilateral dorsolateral PFC MF/CG nicotine withdrawal well impairments work memory high level task difficulty ( Loughead et al. , 2009 ) . In follow-up experiment , find smoke cessation medication varenicline reverse deficit ( Loughead et al. , press ) . In current study , propose extend finding smoke cessation treatment population testing : ( 1 ) whether brain activation connectivity rest state , assess ASL perfusion MRI , BOLD fMRI , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) predict smoke relapse , ( 2 ) whether brain activation , assess BOLD fMRI performance neurobehavioral probe executive cognitive function , stress cue reactivity , predict smoke relapse . Following eligibility screen ( week 0 ) , 100 treatment-seeking smoker complete two 1.5 hour pre-quit neuroimaging assessment ( one follow 24 hour overnight abstinence smoking-as-usual ( week 1 week 2-3 ; order counterbalance ) . All receive standardize behavioral smoke cessation counseling ( week 4 ) prepare schedule quit attempt ( week 5 ) . They make brief visit Center ( week 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 &amp; 9 ) receive booster counsel assess smoking status . The primary endpoint assess quit success : 8 week post-target quit date ( week 13 ) 24-weeks post target quit date ( week 29 ) . At 8-week post-target quit date participant contact telephone survey self-report smoking past 7 day ask come Center biochemical confirmation . Lastly , subset participant ( 15 smoker report abstinent least past 7 day 15 smoker relapse within first week TQD ) ask complete third MRI scan examine change brain activity related cessation . Only participants report quit time point contact 24 week . Identification neural substrate relapse follow quit attempt could inform development novel medication . Further , identification `` brain signature '' predicts relapse may allow use fMRI screen novel medication identify reverse liability profile .</detailed_description>
