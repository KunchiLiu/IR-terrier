	<brief_title>Comparison Preoperative Postoperative Radiotherapy Capecitabine Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although confirmative data favor preoperative chemoradiotherapy , preoperative chemoradiation many theoretical advantage compare postoperative one . Preoperative radiotherapy intensive short course regimen show significant improvement local control even TME , large prospective randomize trial prove efficacy preoperative chemoradiotherapy compare standard postoperative chemoradiotherapy . Although final result German Trial may give answer question , randomize control trial investigate efficacy preoperative chemoradiotherapy use oral fluoropyrimidine many theoretical clinical advantage mention ; German Trial use 5-day continuous infusion 5-FU . The investigator think preoperative chemoradiotherapy oral capecitabine could new standard regimen locally advanced rectal cancer , regimen must compare standard postoperative chemoradiotherapy well design prospective randomize trial . Based potential advantage preoperative chemoradiotherapy oral fluoropyrimidine , investigator plan prospective randomize phase III trial compare preoperative chemoradiotherapy postoperative chemoradiotherapy conventional radiation schedule oral fluoropyrimidine establish new standard neo-adjuvant therapy regimen locally advanced rectal cancer .</detailed_description>
