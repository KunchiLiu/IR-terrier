	<detailed_description>Healthy men woman recruit participate 9 month supervise resistance training ( 3 days/wk ) randomize one three daily supplement group : Whey protein , soy protein , carbohydrate control . Body weight , muscular strength endurance , rest blood pressure assess baseline , 3 , 6 9 month . Body composition assess baseline , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 month . A sub-sample ( N = 17 per group , assess baseline 9 month ) randomly select muscle sample upper leg determine change size muscle fiber , chemical factor associate muscle growth . Blood sample obtain sub-sample participant assess change glucose fat metabolism , well chemical likely promote inhibit muscle growth . We also assess change daily energy expenditure use fuel produce energy ( carbohydrate , fat , protein ) may result intervention . We hypothesize individual receive whey protein supplement large gain muscle large loss fat tissue response resistance training compare receive supplement soy carbohydrate .</detailed_description>
