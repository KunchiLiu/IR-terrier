	<brief_summary>LE-DT novel , proprietary delivery system docetaxel develop NeoPharm , Inc. Docetaxel ( currently market Taxotere ) anti-microtubule agent prevents cell division . By remove toxic detergent use Taxotere , form LE-DT , show reduce toxicity comparable therapeutic efficacy pre-clinical study . The clinical evidence obtain NeoPharm Phase I study show few side effect possibly administer high dose induce great effectiveness LE-DT . In addition , docetaxel show positive activity protein bound taxane therapy treat patient pancreatic cancer . The current Phase II study design accomplish follow objective : 1 . Assess antitumor effect 110 mg/m2 LE-DT administer intravenous ( IV ) every three week pancreatic cancer patient locally advance metastatic disease 2 . To evaluate progression-free survival overall survival 3 . To correlate secrete protein acid rich cysteine expression tumor response 4 . To evaluate safety LE-DT , particular peripheral neuropathy , water retention well myelotoxicity 5 . To correlate pharmacogenetic variation patient LE-DT pharmacodynamic endpoint , include toxicity .</brief_summary>
