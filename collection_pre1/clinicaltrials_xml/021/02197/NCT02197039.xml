	<brief_title>The Selection Criteria Second-look Endoscopy Among Patients With Bleeding Peptic Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peptic ulcer bleed common disease , recurrent bleeding independent risk factor lead mortality . The appearance stigma recent hemorrhage ( SRH ) indicate possible recurrence peptic ulcer bleeding , likelihood decrease course 3-6 day . In addition endoscopic evidence illustrate SRH , patient co-morbidities high risk recurrent bleeding . Patients co-morbidities higher recurrent bleed rate first 3 day also higher delay recurrent bleed 3-day proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) infusion without . More 50 % recurrent bleed develops 3-day PPI infusion among patient end stage renal disease . Although endoscopic treatment plus 72-hour intravenous PPI infusion follow oral PPI already adopt standard treatment peptic ulcer bleed currently , several study show limited effectiveness treatment high risk patient . The reason may lesions SRH completely fade initial treatment include endoscopic hemostasis intravenous PPI infusion . Thus , important issue improve high recurrent bleed risk patient . Endoscopic treatment plus 72-hour intravenous PPI infusion standard protocol treatment peptic ulcer bleeding . Moreover , several study show PPI treatment could decrease presentation SRH . However , insufficient data validate efficacy standard treatment fade SRH , especially among high risk patient . Therefore , several study look efficacy routine second-look endoscopy , define schedule repeat endoscopy primary endoscopic hemostasis patient high risk rebleeding . However , role selection criterion patient require second-look endoscopy remain uncertain . There press need elucidate role second-look endoscopy patient . Hence , purpose prospective study identify risk factor could predict poor fade SRH early recurrent bleed peptic ulcer hemorrhage successful endoscopic hemostasis high-dose PPI infusion . This data show originality clinical importance identify selection criterion patient indicate receive second-look endoscopy .</detailed_description>
