	<brief_title>Evaluation Treatment Tamoxifen Low/Intermediate Risk Bladder Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients primary recurrent low/intermediate-risk papillary urothelial carcinoma bladder undergo resection one marker lesion , measure least 6mm great 10mm , biopsy normal-appearing mucosa . Patients solitary tumor undergo biopsy prior treatment . A 2mm cold cup biopsy marker lesion always perform rule potential high-grade lesion assessment pretreatment immunohistochemistry expression level ERα , ERβ1 , Ki-67 ( proliferation marker ) TUNEL ( apoptosis marker ) . If multiple tumor , lesion , except marker lesion resect sent analysis . These patient receive single immediate post-operative intravesical instillation mitomycin-C . They undergo 12-week course treatment tamoxifen administer single daily oral dose 20mg . At completion therapy , patient undergo resection marker lesion ( biopsy tumor bed , complete response observe ) biopsy normal-appearing bladder mucosa . Toxicity evaluation perform begin ( day 3 ) , midway ( week 6 ) , completion treatment ( week 12 ) , prior resection marker lesion . A final assessment toxicity also perform 30 day completion therapy well second definitive resection marker lesion . Urine sample obtain index tumor place ( marker lesion ) , completion treatment , time definitive transurethral resection index tumor , part standard clinical care patient , discretion surgeon assessment urinary cytology . The urine sample utilize research study . All normal-appearing bladder biopsy ( pre post-treatment ) , additional tumor ( case multiple lesion ) , definitive resection marker lesion ( absence response therapy ) provide sufficient material immunohistochemistry assessment expression level ERα , ERβ-1 , ERβ-2 , ERβ-5 , Ki-67 , TUNEL , also RT-qPCR mRNA analysis ERα , ERβ-1 , ERβ-2 , ERβ-5 . The pretreatment biopsy marker lesion perform small biopsy forceps provide limit material , sufficient immunohistochemistry assessment expression level ERα , ERβ-1 , Ki-67 , TUNEL .</detailed_description>
