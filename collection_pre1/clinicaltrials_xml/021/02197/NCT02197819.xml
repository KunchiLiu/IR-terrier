	<brief_summary>Shoulder dislocation quite common , prevalence lifetime estimate 2 % general population . In young patient , recurrence primary dislocation also common ( ~60 % ) multiple recurrent episode cause significant disability time . Following initial reduction joint , traditional treatment primary shoulder dislocation immobilization sling , arm position adduction internal rotation . The length immobilization period controversial , however author would recommend three six week sling follow several month rehabilitation include range motion strengthen exercise . The clinical course patient approach extensively investigate . Of particular interest relatively high rate recurrent instability young patient , report 17 96 % . A prospective randomize trial need determine whether young patient ( 16-30 yr age ) follow reduction first-time traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation , EMERGENT ( &lt; 4 hour post reduction ) immobilization affect shoulder external rotation reduce rate recurrent instability experience within 12 month versus emergent immobilization traditional internal rotation sling ? Eligible patient randomly allocate sling ER brace . The result study provide best evidence choose emergent immobilization shoulder dislocation .</brief_summary>
