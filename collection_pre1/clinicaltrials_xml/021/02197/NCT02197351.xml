	<brief_summary>It think development cancer stomach follow series stage line becomes increasingly abnormal . Early detection precursor gastric cancer likely enable less invasive treatment . The assessment gastric mucosa use endoscope use detect cancer precursor lesion . Narrow band image us filter light already build modern endoscopoes identify early change gastric lining . The investigator ' hypothesis narrow band image improves detection precursor lesion method amenable international standardization . The investigator conduct prospective trial standard random biopsy , white light guide biopsy , narrow band image guide biopsy perform patient . The yield different method gastric cancer precursor thus compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 BACKGROUND Precursor Lesions Gastric cancer fourth common cancer second lead cause malignant death world . It often present vague symptom dyspepsia consequently frequently diagnose advanced stage . Gastric cancer develop series step begin H. pylori infection . 2-4 It induce inflammatory reaction surround gut epithelium theorize drive subsequent progression patient mucosal atrophy , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia , finally gastric adenonocarcinoma . Systematic biopsy protocol In evaluation precancerous gastric lesion Helicobacter pylorus , expert recommend biopsy obtain antrum ( 3cm pylorus ) , body ( 8cm pylorus ) , insisura/angle . Both great less curvature sample . Additionally , recently develop stag system include OLGIM ( operative clinic intestinal metaplasia ) score require histologic assessment ( via update Sydney score ) two site ( antrum corpus ) . Narrow Band Imaging endoscopy Patients H. pylorus gastritis , gastric atrophy , intestinal metaplasia commonly visible lesion white-light endoscopy , although endoscopic finding may include antral nodularity , absent ruga , prominent gastric vessel white mucosal deposit . However , sensitivity specificity gross finding underlie histological finding poor . Therefore number image-enhancement technique include chromoendoscopy use mucosal dye endoscopy-based virtual chromo-endoscopy ( e.g. , narrow band image ) propose . Narrow band image widely investigate . Narrow band image electronic , noninvasive technique illuminate light endoscope filter enable passage primarily two narrow band light , 415nm 540nm . These wavelength correspond hemoglobin absorption wavelength capillary submucosal vessel respectively . This enhance evaluation mucosal surface pattern vascular irregularity . NBI show useful detection dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus characterization small colonic adenoma . Recently , simple NBI classification use high-definition white light endoscopy propose gastric mucosal examination.18 The NBI interpretation use classification compare histological examination mucosal biopsy , NBI histology determine blinded fashion . This classification define mucosal pattern stomach accuracy exceed 80 % excellent interobserver agreement ( kappa=0.75 ) normal mucosa , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia . However , study do referral center 34 % patient dysplasia NBI compare white light assessment standardize gastric biopsy protocol . Additionally , result provide per patient basis , relevant endpoint clinical practice . 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Prompt detection gastric cancer precursor enable early detection less invasive treatment option endoscopic resection . Narrow band image completely noninvasive technique use filtered light enhance assessment mucosa . Our aim gauge whether biopsy target narrow band image improves detection gastric intestinal metaplasia gastric dysplasia relative standard white light technique per patient basis . A secondary aim ass whether technique amenable standardization might use broadly identify patient early gastric neoplasia . While NBI build vast majority endoscope use physician aware potential use . 3.0 STUDY DESIGN The study prospective tandem endoscopy trial . All EGDs already plan part standard clinical care . High definition white light endoscopy initially perform . The specific location mucosal finding stomach ulceration nodularity require biopsy noted endoscopist research coordinator biopsied NBI . This do blood distort bias NBI assessment . Any abnormal finding part GI tract examine use scope ( esophagus duodenum ) note biopsied . At completion white light exam , scope stomach , white light endoscopist press button scope change view narrow band imaging . At point NBI endoscopist initially blind white light finding enter procedure room examine stomach use NBI . The type location NBI abnormality note biopsy obtain . At end NBI exam NBI endoscopist switch scope view back white light mode . The white light endoscopist return room biopsy site identify recorded initial white-light endoscopy . A research coordinator present entire procedure verify record sit identify initial white light exam biopsied . Subsequently , random biopsy perform take 2 biopsy lesser curvature ( body antrum ) , 2 biopsy great curvature ( body antrum ) , one angle . The biopsy obtain white light exam , narrow band image exam , random sample separately cod submit pathology . Histologic analysis perform expert GI pathologist blind acquisition approach . Short 10 second video clip site target biopsy white light narrow band image record . They match final biopsy result store WITHOUT personal health identifier . These short video may use training share collaborator ass inter-observer variability standardize interpretation NBI stomach . The primary outcome measure yield NBI , high definition white light endoscopy , random biopsy detection atrophic gastritis , IM dysplasia per patient basis . A secondary endpoint number region find method exhibit atrophic gastritis , IM , dysplasia ( per lesion ( region ) yield ) . The yield H. Pylori method total number biopsy guide per method additional outcome . Patients enrol Los Angeles County Hospital University Southern California well Gastroenterology Unit University Porto Porto Portugal . The protocol originate statistical analysis do University Southern California . No personal health identifier exchange point two institution . Prior formal initiation study lead period 10-20 patient gastric symptom . The initial patient examine use white light , NBI , gastric biopsy protocol . After image discuss investigator two center make certain NBI interpretation gastric premalignant change standardize . The LAC+USC investigator also review Portugese video training library gastric NBI . Any change performance lead versus study note address secondary aim develop standardized approach NBI may help technique use widely identify patient early gastric neoplasia . 4 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The Fisher 's exact chi square test use dichotomous outcome accurate detection high level histology number biopsy . Adverse reaction report descriptive manner . Based previous research show 74 % correction detection gastric cancer precursor white light endoscopy versus 89 % NBI give anticipated gastric cancer prevalence 20 % perform preliminary sample size estimate range OR use G*Power ( alpha=0.05 , beta =0.20 ) . We anticipate N 200 sufficient show significant difference method .</detailed_description>
