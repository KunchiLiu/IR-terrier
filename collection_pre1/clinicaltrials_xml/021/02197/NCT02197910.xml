	<brief_summary>In study assess effect bioactive peptide rich wheat product blood pressure estimate cardiovascular disease risk . This pilot , explorative , cross-over , randomize double-blind 2 group x 2-arms control , clinical trial . The intervention base commercially-packaged pasta , appear taste ; ( ) low dose bioactive peptide vs. ( ii ) high dose bioactive peptide . Inclusion Criteria : Male female non-diabetic adult volunteer increase estimate CV risk ( ESC/EAS SCORE ) SBP 130-139 mmHg and/or DBP 85-90 mmHg ) ; Age include 40 70 year old ; Primary prevention CVD otherwise good general health major illness previous 6-months ; Volunteer provide sign date informed consent form . Exclusion Criteria : Severe medical illness/chronic disease/gastrointestinal pathology ( e.g . coeliac disease ) ; Secondary prevention CVD ; Treatment drug potentially affect BP ( include antihypertensive drug ) relate CV risk factor ; Consumption nutraceuticals , botanical extract vitamin supplement ; Volunteer diagnose hypertensive A total 60 participant recruit follow adherence standardize diet 4-week period , randomly assign complete one 2 treatment sequence consume prescribed quantity pasta product 4-week period follow 4-week washout random assignment 2nd treatment . The Primary Outcome modification office blood pressure ( assess systolic diastolic BP , pulse mean pressure ( mean 3 stand &amp; sit measure ) 24-hour blood pressure . Additional outcome include : Anthropometric parameter ( Weight , WC , HC , WC/HC , ICO , BMI ) , Glucose Lipid profile ( TC , LDL-C , HDL-C , TG , non-HDL cholesterol , risk ratio ) , Estimated CVD risk change ( EAS/ESC SCORE Charts ) , Measures vascular health ( FMD , PWA , PWV , Aix ) , Liver renal functionality biomarkers , 24-h urine collection baseline treatment phase 1 endpoint final phase analyse account potential confounding urinary sodium excretion ( intake ) As require GCPs GLPs , SOPs already establish personnel involve study continuously train trial similar outcome</brief_summary>
