	<detailed_description>All eligible patient treat SGI-110 9 cycle 28 day . Patients meet eligibility criterion administer subcutaneous SGI-110 60mg/m²/d one time daily 5 day . Each cycle last 28 day SGI-110 starting day 1 cycle . Patients receive least 9 cycle unless overt progression document . ( Overt progression define presence 30 % marrow blast double marrow blast percentage onset SGI-110 ) . Dose reduction 45 even 30 mg/m²/d make case toxicity . Patients Complete Remission ( CR ) , Partial Remission ( PR ) , marrow CR , Hematological Improvement ( HI ) stable disease ( SD ) 6 Cycles therapy ( IWG 2006 criterion ) may receive 3 additional cycle .
