	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 inhibitor ( Itraconazole Clarithromycin ) , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ( study way drug enters leave blood tissue time ) single dose JNJ-54861911 healthy male participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effects Clarithromycin Pharmacokinetics JNJ-54861911 Healthy Male Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , open-label ( participant researcher aware treatment , participant receive ) , fixed-sequence study healthy male participant consist 2 sequential part . For participant enrol either part , study consist 3 phase : Screening Phase ( within 21 2 day prior first dose administration Day 1 ) , Open-label Treatment Phase ( Day 1 Day 12 ) , Follow-up Phase ( 7 14 day last dose administration ) . The maximum duration study 7 week per participant . Study conduct 2 part understand relative role CYP3A4 amide hydrolysis pathway JNJ-54861911 metabolism potential drug-drug interaction liability inhibitor pathways . Itraconazole administer Part 1 mixed CYP3A4 potential amide hydrolysis inhibitor . Clarithromycin administer Part 2 pure CYP3A4 inhibitor . However , Part 2 study conduct relevant interaction observe itraconazole base interim review Part 1 data . Participants enrol Part 1 receive single dose JNJ-54861911 , 25 milligram ( mg ) tablet orally Day 1 Day 9 along itraconazole 200 mg ( 2*100 mg capsule ) orally daily Day 5 Day 12 . Participants enrol Part 2 receive single dose JNJ-54861911 , 25 mg tablet orally Day 1 Day 9 along clarithromycin 500 mg immediate release tablet orally twice daily Day 5 Day 12 . Blood sample collect pre-dose ( Day 1 ) Day 13 understand PK characteristic JNJ-54861911 diaminothiazine ( DIAT , metabolite form amide hydrolysis JNJ-54861911 ) . In addition , blood sample collect Day -1 enrol participant study genotyping CYP3A4 gene genetic factor may influence PK , safety , and/or tolerability JNJ-54861911 CYP3A4 inhibitor . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
