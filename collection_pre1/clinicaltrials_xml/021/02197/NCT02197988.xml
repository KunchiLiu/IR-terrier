	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare clinical profile two currently acceptable analgesia technique term incidence hypotension subsequent fluid administration pain control evaluation objective subjective data . The investigator also compare additional hospital cost associated side effect management relate either analgesia method . This study prospective , randomize , open-label trial . Patients agree participate satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize time enrollment one two group ( thoracic epidural TAP block ) use randomization tool create study . Patients undergo schedule surgery receive analgesic method randomize . Both method ( thoracic epidural TAP block ) perform routinely Spectrum Health consider routine care . Data collect include medical history demographic patient 's medical record . Intraoperative data include length surgery , estimate surgical blood loss , complication , blood pressure medication requirement . Postoperative data include episode hypotension ( define systolic BP &lt; 90 ) , fluid requirement first 24 hour first 72 hour , pain score , narcotic usage , return bowel function ( defined flatus ) , time tolerate soft regular diet , complication . Data also collect via survey study patient complete study purpose .</detailed_description>
