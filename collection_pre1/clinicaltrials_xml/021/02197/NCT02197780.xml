	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A substantial proportion child teenager suspect inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) refer endoscopy disease . The investigator design clinical decision rule include calprotectin stool test discern patient require investigation . The accuracy diagnostic strategy 88.5 % low risk miss IBD case . Although number negative endoscopy reduce introduction strategy , still 22 % refer child teenager underwent unnecessary invasive test . S100A12 ( calgranulin C ) cytoplasmic protein secrete exclusively activate neutrophils stool marker may IBD-specific calprotectin . OBJECTIVE : To determine whether specificity S100A12 superior specificity calprotectin without sacrifice sensitivity HYPOTHESIS : Inclusion calgranulin C stool test improve specificity screening-strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DESIGN : A prospective diagnostic accuracy study several outpatient clinic general paediatrics several tertiary care hospital Netherlands Belgium . STUDY POPULATION : Eligible inclusion consecutive child teenager 6 18 year consult pediatrician gastro-intestinal symptom suggestive IBD . INTERVENTION : Patients manage accord calprotectin-based-referral strategy . Those elevated calprotectin level without colon pathogen consider high probability IBD may require referral endoscopy ( preferred reference standard ) . Patients confirm gastrointestinal infection advise stool retested . Patients normal calprotectin level consider low probability IBD therefore low change subject endoscopy . In patient low probablity IBD alternative reference standard may perform , clinical follow-up 6 month . The decision endoscopy clinical follow clinician 's discretion , base combination symptom , physical examination , blood result , fecal marker colon pathogen . Next calprotectin , also S100A12 measure stool sample . We perform post hoc scenario analysis compare test characteristic fecal marker . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure difference specificity FC S100A12 among total number non-IBD patient . We adjust previously formulate outcome measure , proportion patient non-inflammatory condition among total number patient subject endoscopy , two reason . 1 . During interim analysis August 2016 proportion patient subject endoscopy low expect ( 34 % instead 46 % ) . To reach required amount patient reference standard ( endoscopy ) need extend study several month . 2 . Triggered recently publish paper Naaktgeboren et al BMJ , realize initial design would lead biased result . Secondary endpoint difference sensitivity among total number patient IBD diagnostic accuracy characteristic ( sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , area curve , best cut-off point ) marker individually . All diagnostic accuracy characteristic calculate 1 ) pre-specified cut-off value base literature , 2 ) best cut-off point calculate data trial . POWER/DATA ANALYSIS : At start trial defined sample size calculation , base previously describe outcome measure include patient endoscopy . Based previous cohort study expect 46 % recruited patient would undergo endoscopy . Using sample size calculation base independent sample calculate Fisher 's exact test , calculate 154 patient subject endoscopy study would 80 % power detect 50 % relative reduction primary outcome 22 % false positives FC 11 % false positives S100A12 , one-sided alpha level 0.05 . The total number patient recruit diagnostic accuracy study therefore calculate 335 . In slipstream adjustment primary outcome measure , adjust sample size . We use McNemar 's test pair sample compare proportion concordant discordant result FC S100A12 patient disease without disease . To calculate new sample size use specificity FC 0.70 , base recent individual patient data meta-analysis Degraeuwe expect S100A12 would lead 50 % relative improvement . A sample size 130 subject achieve 80 % power detect difference 0,15 two diagnostic test whose specificity 0,70 0,85 . This procedure use two-sided McNemar test significance level 0,05 . The prevalence non-IBD population 0,64 . The proportion discordant pair 0,23 . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS : The Medical Ethical Committee University Medical Center Groningen grant exemption WMO-approval , involve collection data generate routine medical care . After measurement calprotectin level test microbial gut pathogen residual material use measurement calgranulin C level . When patient parent give permission , residual feces store maximum period 15 year future diagnostic research . TIME SCHEDULE : Total running time 30 month , include 6 month complete follow 2 month analysis reporting .</detailed_description>
