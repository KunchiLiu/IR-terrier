	<brief_summary>Adenomyosis characterize appearance endometrial cell muscular layer uterus . It affect 15-20 % female population . The symptoms adenomyosis heavy menstrual bleeding painful menstruation ( dysmenorrhea ) addition chronic pelvic pain . Subfertility infertility correlate adenomyosis . Parity , age uterine abrasion increase risk adenomyosis . Hormonal factor local hyperestrogenism elevate level prolactin ( PRL ) identify , autoimmune mechanical factor also hypothesize . Regarding treatment , effective measure hysterectomy . As drastic measure young woman , levonogestrel-releasing intrauterine device , Gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) -analogues , Danazol , uterine embolization endometrial ablation try , study number , retrospective , small sample size . Adenomyosis far subject extensive research effort . The pathogenesis adenomyosis remain still unclear , many satisfy treatment option diagnostics include mostly magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) histology . The investigator design series 3 study broad approach understanding adenomyosis . This part 2 . In study investigator take tissue sample blood sample investigate order understand basic process leading adenomyosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Norwegian Adenomyosis Study II : Gene Expression Profiling Adenomyosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biopsy focal adenomyosis myometrium : This extension NAPPED1-study . The investigator perform ultrasound-guided transvaginal biopsy myometrium collect venous blood sample . As recent study suggest abnormality regulation specific gene development adenomyosis , investigator want investigate differentially express gene adenomyosis compare eutopic endometrium . Using microarrays , investigator simultaneously screen difference expression thousand gene sample two group . Profiling study perform endometrium healthy individual endometriosis show result enable identification biological process molecular mechanism . Expression profile use identify molecular target therapeutic purpose . There interesting study investigate drug treatment molecular level e.g . effect Danazol treatment eutopic ectopic endometrial tissue , intramural adenomyosis subject gene profiling yet . Tissue sample easily obtain hysterectomy , sample represent old woman , use consecutive monitoring biochemical effect treatment , uterus remove . In order investigate pathophysiology adenomyosis young woman , compare old individual , well evaluate effect treatment , necessary able obtain in-vivo sample . The plan therefore take transvaginal , ultrasound-guided biopsy-samples uterus ( myometrium ) include patient begin surgery , patient full anesthesia . The safety comparable procedure show prior study , investigator validate safety method . The investigator believe in-vivo biopsy safe measure , representative sample adenomyosis obtain . The challenge adenomyosis locate intramyometrially . A transcervical biopsy contaminate sample eutopic endometrium , therefore meaningful take biopsy transvaginally , cavity . After obtain biopsy sample , examine histologically imprint , confirm glandular cell contain expect . When good routine show reliable level specificity , investigator go select approximately 10 patient gene profile adenomyosis . The investigator also use endometrial biopsy ( Pipelle ) patient see difference intramural adenomyosis eutopic endometrium . Most patient undergo hysterectomy take pipelle-biopsy routinely . The level prolactin , Anti-m√ºllerian hormone ( AMH ) , Follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) estrogen also take , order determine severity adenomyosis relate age show , also hormonal activity .</detailed_description>
