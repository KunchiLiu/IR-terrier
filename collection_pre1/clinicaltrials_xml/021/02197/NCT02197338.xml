	<detailed_description>1.0 BACKGROUND Bile duct access difficult part endoscopic retrograde cholangiography ( ERCP ) perform biliary indication bile duct stone , leak , stricture . In past decade evolution technology approach use achieve selective biliary cannulation , In classic approach standard cannula place biliary orifice contrast injected confirm placement . Subsequently , long wire pass assistant deeply duct cannulatome exchange sphincterotome use perform papillotomy . The first major change cannulation approach widespread use sphincterotome obtain initial biliary access lieu cannulatome . This part drive economics . With advent endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) almost ERCP therapeutic sphincterotomy typically part approach.1 Thus sensible forgo step use cannulatome enables diagnostic ERCP . In addition cutting , wire distal tip sphincterotome enable variable flexion direction bile duct , feature lack cannulatome . Additionally , high quality comparison trial suggest sphincterotome superior cannulatome initial access . Schwacha et al prospectively randomized patient bile duct cannulation standard cannulatome versus sphincterotome.2 After five attempt bile duct access achieve 62 % standard catheter group compare 84 % sphincterotome group . Cortus et al randomized patient &lt; 15 attempt access bile duct cannulatome versus sphincterotome find initial biliary access obtain 67 % former versus 97 % latter groups.3 In addition mean number cannulation attempt time achieve selective biliary cannulation also less sphincterotome group . Given consideration American endoscopists use sphincterotomes initial biliary cannulation.4 Most modern sphincterotomes two three lumen enable simulatenous passage contrast wire bile duct . Traditionally , contrast first inject confirm bile duct oppose pancreatic duct access . In 2004 Lella randomize 400 patient standard approach contrast injection versus passage guidewire confirm bile duct cannulation.5 In contrast group 4 % patient develop pancreatitis compare none wire guide group high pancreatic enzyme level ( 5 time upper limit normal ) develop 20 % contrast guide versus 5 % wire guide case . Subsequent large randomize trial consistently demonstrate post ERCP pancreatitis rate 2-9 % wire guide versus 10-17 % contrast guide ERCP.6-7 Wire guide cannulation also show shorten cannulation fluoroscopy times.8 1.2 Additionally , several new technology introduce potential unproven advantage . Traditionally ERCP wire long combination scope channel accessory length assistant could control placement procedure . Recently , short wire system develop wire may strip catheter tear away lumens distal aspect ( 5-50cm ) depend accessory.9 A strip sphincterotome accomodates short wire completely control endoscopist enable physician control wire passage . A locking device scope allow short wire fix reliably therapeutic maneuver . The advantage short wire system decrease reliance assistant . The disadvantage may decrease backpressure sphincterotome may achieve base Newton 's third law ( pull wire back help advance tome forward ) . There little published work compare short wire traditional long wire system . Available data suggest trend toward short fluoroscopy procedure times.10 Additionally , short wire system appear enable short time bile duct system placement compare long wire system . A recent national survey reveal 43 % endoscopists favor short wire system compare 33 % long wire system.4 1.3 An additional technology frequently use facilitate cannulation small size sphincterotomes . Theoretically , small diameter tome may enable access bile duct diminutive orifice . One small randomize trial compare standard 5Fr tome 4Fr tome . Cannulation group 84 % though study prematurely terminated.11 In patient biliary access still achieve often another type sphincterotome cannulatome use . If work wire pancreatic stent often place pancreatic duct ideally change orientation papilla favorable way.12 The latter strategy also decrease risk post ERCP pancreatitis difficult case include undergone multiple cannulation attempts.13 If approach fail access precut papillotomy may perform use needle knife . Precut sphincterotomy direction bile duct either performed orifice ( gough ) orifice ( fistulotomy ) .12 , 14 Currently small standard tome routinely use LAC . The Rx System convert long short wire method use device . Both long short wire approach routinely perform LAC . There standardized approach . 2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE To assess whether initial bile duct cannulation 39Fr versus 44Fr sphincterotomes long verus short wire system favor successful bile duct cannulation minimize complication . This help develop evidence base approach initial bile duct access endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . 3.0 STUDY DESIGN : The study prospective randomize controlled trial . All patient undergo ERCP standard indication include stone , leak jaundice eligible . Those undergone prior sphincterotomy , ensure biliary access exclude . Additionally prior ERCP fail bile duct cannulation exclude . Additionally , patient require ERCP pancreatic indication pancreatic duct leak exlcluded bile duct cannulation require clinical indication . Patients randomize use 2 x 2 factorial design initial cannulation attempt small versus standard sphincterotome ( 1:1 ) short versus long wire system ( 1:1 ) . The Rx Biliary System ( Boston Scientific ; Natick , MA ) use . In randomized short wire approach , wire strip tear away lumen convert long short wire system . The wire control endoscopist `` physician control . '' In randomize long wire approach long wire leave lumen strip . The wire control assistant . Those randomize small size tome initially use 39Fr tome randomize standard tome use 44Fr tome . In 4 group initial successful cannulation define acquisition deep bile duct access within first 8 attempt . An attempt define placement cannula biliary orifice follow advancement wire contrast injection . At LAC+USC procedure perform 2-3 third year fellows recognize clinically technically excellent . Fellows level ; first year second year fellow allow perform ERCP . All procedure directly supervise faculty physician take cannulation fellow successfully 3-5 attempt . Faculty physicans perform procedure alone rare circumstance . However , account possibility randomization stratify 3rd fellow+faculty faculty alone . To account variability assistant make certain policy nursing assistant rotate monthly basis enforce ensure even distribution technical assistance reflect real word scenario . If biliary cannulation achieve 8 attempt wire system sphincterotome size may use discretion attend endoscopist . Thus assign tome wire approach may abandon continued discretion faculty member perform case . Additionally , pancreatic wire stent placement precut sphincterotomy perform discretion attend endoscopist . The primary outcome successful initial bile duct cannulation define cannulation assign technology within first 8 attempt . The secondary outcome include total cannulation fluoroscopy time , inadvertent , pancreatic duct access , ERCP complication All patient inpatient see follow-up second procedure day data ass outcomes collect study team . They call 7 day procedure . Those discharged day procedure call 1 day procedure 7 day procedure assess outcomes . Thus patient assess either follow visist phone call 1 7 day post procedure . 4.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATONS : A 2 x 2 factorial design use 1:1 randomization 44Fr versus 39Fr tome 1:1 randomization long short wire system . Our priori hypothesis 10 % difference successful initial cannulation ( 85 % 95 % ) . At alpha 0.05 beta 0.10 sample size 498 need demonstrate difference . A planned interim analysis perform 200 patient enrol . The rule stop follow ; A ) If significant difference primary outcome ( cannulation within 8 attempt ) reach one arm ( wire length cannulatome size ) arm stop . An interim test effect administration compute determine sample size remain arm 2 group design move forward . B ) If superior wire length cannulatome size strategy ( arm ) demonstrate 200 case trial stop report . C ) If significance reach neither arm 200 case , 4 group continue sample size 500 reach . D ) If significantly complication include pancreatitis , perforation , bleeding , cholangitis see one arm ( wire length cannulatome size ) arm stop . Dichotomous outcome compare use Fischer 's exact chi square test continuous outcome compare use Wilcoxan rank sum test . Statistical analysis perform biostatisticians Biostatistical Bioinformatics Resource Group within SC CTSI .</detailed_description>
