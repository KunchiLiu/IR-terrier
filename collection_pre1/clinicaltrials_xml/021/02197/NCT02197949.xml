	<brief_summary>At present , patient diagnose breast cancer infiltration axillary lymph-nodes submit axillary lymph-node dissection ( ALND ) . The sentinel node ( SN ) technique indicate lymph-node biopsy cytology positive , surgical treatment upfront neither neoadjuvant systemic therapy indicate . The reason perform SN patient diagnose infiltrated axilla though ultrasound-guided biopsy cytology tend high tumoral load diagnose sentinel biopsy . Furthermore , even patient submit neoadjuvant systemic treatment axillary clinical exploration negative treatment , different study show SN false negative rate unacceptably high . Despite fact , high proportion patient positive axilla diagnosis submit level I II axillary lymph node dissection show lymph node infiltrated pathological study , frequently four less neoplastic node . New method detect patient limited infiltrated node develop new approach axillary surgery ( i.e. , partial resection ) offer . To date , information expect get axillary imaging perform axilla infiltrate . No information tumoral load demand . In hand , level I II ALND perform accord establish anatomic limit , without select node excise neither identify one infiltrate directed excision . The aim study evaluate ability specify reproducible image protocol distinguish patient high axillary tumoral load one low tumoral load . At time , initial node receive lymph drainage one commonly affect , identify node inject dilute methylene blue retroareolar parenchyma study tumoral load could help select patient high low axillary tumoral load . Evaluation step ( , first image protocol follow methylene blue protocol ) , could eventually help distinguish patient submit classical level I II ALND one spar excise lymph node stain methylene blue .</brief_summary>
