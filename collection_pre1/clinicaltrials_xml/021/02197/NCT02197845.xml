	<brief_summary>Multi-phase , patient navigator-based program Richmond Tidewater region Virginia demonstrate : 1. feasibility use patient navigator improve percentage child adult ( age 15 old ) patient sickle cell disease ( SCD ) SCD specialty care 2. efficacy use patient navigator improve hydroxyurea ( HU ) ( re- ) initiation adherence among adult patient SCD eligible HU ( Patient navigator may also know public health worker . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Use Hydroxyurea In Sickle Cell Disease Using Patient Navigators</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The state Virginia , include Virginia Department Health three academic medical center one federally qualified health center , plan two-phase demonstration , first improvement percentage adult SCD SCD specialty care ( Phase I ) , improvement adherence HU eligible SCD adult ( Phase II ) . Both phase use exist academic SCD provider , innovative , multimodal strategy , feature specially train SCD patient navigator ( PNs ) , address barrier care HU use . In Phase I demonstrate feasibility utilizing PNs overcome patient access barrier SCD care . In Phase II test efficacy PNs overcome barrier acceptance adherence HU therapy . Patients randomize PN arm usual care arm . Providers implement NIH guideline HU eligibility prescribe arm . All HU eligible patient offer HU clinical visit . Among patient prescribe HU , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD , define end point ) reach , provider dose escalate every 8-12 week MTD , rather clinical effect , declare treatment success failure . This project critically important impactful demonstrate feasibility statewide community-based strategy assist vulnerable SCD adult obtain SCD specialty care likely prolong life , model state could adopt .</detailed_description>
