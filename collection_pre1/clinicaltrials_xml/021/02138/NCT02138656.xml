	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether course chiropractic treatment significant impact natural course infantile colic , specifically : 1 . Do parent colicky infant randomise group receive course McTimoney chiropractic treatment : - report significantly great improvement hour cry control group ? - report significantly great improvement quality life ( anxiety depression ) ? - report `` resolution '' colic follow treatment control group ? 2 . What effect parental blind parentally-reported symptom infantile colic parental quality life ? The study also include exploratory investigation determine whether : 1 . Any particular grouping patient characteristic ( example ; 'other ' presenting symptom , position natural course colic , age onset , spinal dysfunction , perinatal factor ) associate good poor outcome 2 . Any particular characteristic treatment ( e.g . specific adjustment ) associate good poor outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall Design The study two-by-two factorial design combine group chiropractic treatment 'Best Standard Care ' blind unblinded parent . The two treatment group 'Best Standard Care ' ( BSC ) 'Best Standard Care plus chiropractic ' ( Chiro ) . Best standard care base recommendation United Kingdom ( UK ) National Health Service ( NHS ) , use Map Medicine care map . Chiropractic treatment deliver accord protocol define participate chiropractor . There two blind two unblinded group . The blinded BSC group receive 'sham ' treatment addition BSC counselling . The unblinded BSC group require . In addition , allow effect n-shaped curve inherent natural course colic evaluate , group stratify age entry ( 4 week ( expect increase cry 2 week main intervention ) , 4 6 week ( expect plateau ) , 6 week ( decrease cry ) ) . The study longitudinal design ~4 1/2 week period . For primary outcome take data cry diary , main data point define : - Baseline : 24 hour period day first treatment - First treatment : 24 hour period day first treatment - Mid-point treatment : 24 hour period day second treatment - Final treatment : 24 hour period day third treatment Secondary outcome include data follow point : - Follow-up 1 : 24 hour period day 7 day third treatment - Follow-up 2 : 24 hour period day 14 day third treatment Other data source : - The initial visit questionnaires - Follow-up questionnaire approximately 2 day first treatment , 2 day 2nd treatment , 2 day final treatment , around day 21 day 28 . Instruments Data collection do 8 main data collection instrument , draft develop : - First contact questionnaire - Crying Diary ( include severity symptom ) - Initial Visit Questionnaire - Part 1 ( demographic history ) - Initial Visit Questionnaire - Part 2 ( success blinding ) - Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire ( CEQ ) - Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale - Adjustments record - Weekly telephone questionnaire Power The sample size 160 , calculate achieve 80 % power , 5 % significance level , use estimate standard deviation around 2 ( base result similar study ) 1 hour between-groups difference ( identify 'clinically relevant reduction cry time ' parental survey ) allow 25 % attrition rate latter 2 week ( base experience similar study ) . Analysis : Primary Outcomes For primary analysis comparison carry use data one analysis ass significance treatment , blindness age group ANCOVA . This include interaction term ass whether treatment effect different different level blindness different age group baseline variable include covariates . A logistic regression analysis use produce odds ratio comparison treatment , blindness age group . The between-groups difference proportion ( risk ratio ) patient report 'complete resolution ' colic symptom ( PGIS ) first , mid-point final treatment ( primary outcome ) follow ups ( secondary outcome ) Adverse event report analysis . Extraction primary data cry diary perform observer blind group allocation . The primary analysis perform statistician blind group allocation . Secondary Outcomes The primary analysis primary outcome extend day 21 28 , . The ANCOVA extend evaluate between-group difference - Cost NHS resource usage - Duration infant fussy It anticipate parent compliance complete diary likely deteriorate clinic visit cease . However , regular telephone call attempt encourage continue completion . The primary study outcome base first 15 day diary anticipate great compliance time . Investigative Analysis The exploratory investigation seek establish association outcome measure ( daily hour cry , presence symptom , Parental Global Impressions Severity ( PGIS ) , Parental Global Impressions Change ( PGIC ) , 'resolution ' colic ) first , mid-point final treatment , follow-ups predictor variable gather initial visit ( Part 1 ) . For example , : - baseline daily hour cry - initial symptom trajectory ; worsening , plateau , improve - baseline 'other symptom ' , low , medium high severity - age onset - perinatal factor ( Miller , 2007 ) - treatment characteristic Intention treat v per protocol Since clinical study , primary analysis do intention-to-treat basis , include patient fail comply protocol group ( e.g . drop treatment group ) . For analysis , accurate data require ( e.g . actual adjustment perform ) impute . In case , analysis do per protocol basis . Missing data Previous study report majority dropout occur no-treatment group due worsen symptoms treatment group due resolution symptom , data impute last value carry forward represent conservative approach . For primary cry time outcome data , record Day 8 , carry forward Day 15 . Where reason withdrawal basis worsening symptom give , include data point within PGIS &amp; PGIC analysis , imputation require . Attempts make contact drop-outs ascertain reason choose continue study report separately . For analysis , longitudinal analysis variance ass change time treatment , blindness age group together interaction covariates . Although may loss data later time period , repeat measure analysis able cope without imputation miss data . Numbers subject respond study progressing stage record CONSORT-style flow diagram .</detailed_description>
