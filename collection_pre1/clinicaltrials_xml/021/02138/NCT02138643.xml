	<detailed_description>Achalasia disorder benign esophageal motor , characterized failure relax low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) response swallow associate lack peristalsis esophageal body . Its common clinical presentation dysphagia , occasionally chest pain , regurgitation , aspiration pneumonia weight loss , result large impact daily activity quality life affect individual . Epidemiological data show incidence United States Europe , approximately 1/200.000 predilection sex , age group ( mean 25 60 year ) observe , well demographic group . In Brazil , incidence approximate 7-13/100.000 inhabitant . Large proportion patient symptomatic achalasia require additional test diagnosis . Endoscopy ( EDA ) despite regarded major test initial evaluation dysphagia , present serious limitation evaluate esophageal motility , especially early stage . Some contrast study , highlight Esophagogram barium ( DSE ) , provide additional anatomical finding esophageal shape size , well functional : peristalsis , LES function bolus clearance esophagogastric junction ( TEG ) . Another useful method diagnosis Esophageal manometry , characteristic ( Chicago Classification Distal Esophageal Motility Disorders ) : aperistalsis esophageal body failure relax LES , currently best characterize High Resolution Manometry . Idiopathic achalasia confine esophagus establish etiology , agenesis myenteric plexus viral infection , particular herpes simplex ( HSV - 1 ) , likely hypothesis . In Brazil , secondary achalasia cause Chagas disease predominantly among etiology , involves express primarily systemic disease esophageal involvement . Infected patient Typanossoma cruzi , causative agent Chagas disease , 7-10 % esophageal involvement , due chronic nature common clinical presentation megaesophagus , vary degree . There currently consider curative treatment achalasia , dysphagia relief primary therapeutic target force relax LES endoscopy surgery . Thus , commonly use endoscopic treatment force dilatation cardia botulinum toxin . Laparoscopic Heller myotomy antireflux procedure therapy consider `` gold standard `` excellent result minimal invasiveness . Currently , pneumatic dilation surgical treatment Heller myotomy fundoplication strongly associate best therapeutic option available . Many study validate efficacy pneumatic dilation case exceed 90 % , limitation need serial dilation , main complication perforation , around 8 % . With introduction minimally invasive surgery , surgical approach gain great clinical importance , especially laparoscopic Heller myotomy antireflux valve ( fundoplication ) . With success rate range 89 100 % recent study , provide last relief symptom without need additional intervention , compare pneumatic dilation . In recent year , possibility use endoluminal access treatment achalasia patient technique originally describe Natural orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) continue advance submucosal dissection enable concomitant development new approach describe perioral endoscopic myotomy . In 2007 , Pasricha et al , describe feasibility endoscopic esophageal myotomy submucosal tunnel initially animal model . The first performance procedure human describe Inoue et al , 2010 , introduce concept transluminal endoscopic surgery natural orifice , objective minimize trauma stress result open surgical procedure . These author call procedure POEM ( Per Oral Endoscopic myotomy ) . OBJECTIVE The primary objective protocol compare efficacy surgical approach laparoscopic myotomy fundoplication associate Heller myotomy endoscopic peroral ( POEM ) treatment patient achalasia regardless etiology .</detailed_description>
