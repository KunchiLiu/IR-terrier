	<brief_title>Hepatectomy Versus Chemoembolization Initial Treatment Resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Beyond Milan Criteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient large/multiple , resectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCCs ) without macrovascular invasion extrahepatic spread , choice treatment remain largely controversial . For patient , transarterial lipiodol chemoembolization ( TACE ) recommend palliative therapy . On hand , many author still believe hepatic resection potential curative treatment patient still feasible remove macroscopic tumor safely surgery . With advance surgical technique , large/multiple HCCs resectable , long-term result report ranged 30 % 58 % 5 year ; even patient large bilobar multiple HCC could reach survival rate 20 % 5 year hepatic resection . Until , study compare outcomes hepatic resection TACE treatment multiple HCCs , report controversial result . Some study show hepatic resection survival benefi TACE , study show opposite result ( 11-15 ) . Therefore , investigator perform prospective study consecutive patient large/multiple , resectable HCCs compare outcomes patient underwent hepatic resection TACE initial treatment .</detailed_description>
