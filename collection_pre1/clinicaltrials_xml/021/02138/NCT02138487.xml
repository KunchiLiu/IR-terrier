	<brief_title>Restricted Convalescence : Outcomes Following Urogynecologic Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic floor disorder ( PFD ) dramatically affect million woman 's quality life ( QOL ) , 30 % American woman undergo reconstructive surgery urinary incontinence pelvic organ prolapse improve bothersome symptom quality life . Surgical goal woman PFD often resume normal activity , limit secondary bothersome symptom . Yet , traditionally surgeon place strict postoperative restriction patient 's activity level 3 month ; sometimes even recommend life long lifting activity restriction . Activity restriction impose premise exercise `` weaken '' surgical healing ; however , emerge data field suggests increase activity may actually promote heal process . We aim determine whether satisfaction , recovery , anatomic outcome surgery related type postoperative activity recommendation ( liberal versus restrict ) . Women surgery PFD randomize receive either liberal restrict postoperative activity recommendation satisfaction , symptom , QOL anatomic outcome measure surgery . We hypothesize woman liberal activity recommendation recover quickly report high satisfaction QOL , few symptom , similar anatomic outcome woman restrict activity restriction . These data change paradigms woman 's health recovery surgery .</detailed_description>
