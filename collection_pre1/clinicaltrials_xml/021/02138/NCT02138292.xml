	<brief_summary>The study prospective , single-arm , one-site therapeutic trial combination trametinib plus digoxin advanced melanoma . endpoint toxicity assess nCi CTCae v4.1 within first 8 week , response measure ReCiST v1.1 criterion every 8 week scans exam , tumor sensitivity drug combination quantify tumor regression nSG mouse , correlation response tumor sensitivity , BRaF status , MaPK inhibitor exposure history , tumor sodium pump expression . Treatment Dosage administration Study Drugs : 1 . Trametinib ( 2mg ) administer orally daily basis . 2 . Digoxin ( 0.25mg ) administer orally daily basis . 8-week cycle , duration treatment last 8 104 week . endpoint 1 . Toxicities assess via nCi 's CTCae v4.1 toxicity criterion . DLTs define base rate drug-related ( definitely probably ) grade 3-5 adverse event experience within first 8 week study treatment . The MTD exceed 20 % patient study experience DLTs . 2 . Responses measure ReCiST v1.1 every 8 week . Response duration define time first document response disease progression . PFS time treatment disease progression . 3 . Patient tumor sensitivity drug combination quantify amount subcutaneous establish tumor growth inhibition nSG mouse 5d/week oral gavage drug . 4 . Tumor nRaS status determine tumor Dna extraction , PCR amplification exon Sanger sequence nRaS . 5 . History prior MaPK inhibitor therapy document MeK inhibitor exposure . 6 . Sodium pump subunit expression analyze pretreatment tumor immunohistochemistry qualitative 0 3+ grading system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 1B Clinical Trial Trametinib Plus Digoxin Patients With Unresectable Metastatic BRAF Wild-type Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : - To describe toxicity estimate frequency dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) digoxin combination trametinib advance melanoma patient estimate frequency DLTs . - To measure response rate , response duration progression free survival ( PFS ) digoxin plus trametinib advanced melanoma . Secondary Objectives : - To correlate NSG xenograft sensivity drug combination clinical response patient . - To compare response rate MAPK inhibitor naive versus refractory patient NRAS mutant versus wild-type patient sodium pump 3 subunit high tumor expression versus low tumor expression patient . Rationale : Having establish cell culture xenograft system study patient melanoma sample , researcher able grow tumor vitro vivo single cell find correlation tumor metastatic behavior immunocompromised mouse patient . Recently extend experiment examine melanoma sensitivity novel compound . In screens FDA approve drug , find several cardenolides include digoxin reproducibly exhibit great toxicity primary human melanoma compare range normal human cell . They examine anti-tumor efficacy primary human melanoma grow vivo xenograft . While trametinib , vemurafenib , digoxin digitoxin individually slow growth human melanoma xenograft , cause tumor regression . However , combination digoxin digitoxin trametinib cause substantial tumor regression use melanoma obtain multiple patient , BRAF mutation without . The effect dramatically well trametinib , digoxin , digitoxin vemurafenib alone . No difference efficacy combination see BRAF mutant BRAF wild-type sample .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologic diagnosis unresectable metastatic melanoma . For unknown primary disease , diagnosis metastatic disease cytology FNA acceptable . BRAF wildtype confirm , NRAS mutation assess . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year . 3 . Any number prior systemic therapeutic regimen unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma . This include chemotherapy , immunotherapy , pathway inhibitor , biochemotherapy , investigational treatment . Patients may also receive therapy adjuvant setting . 4 . ECOG Performance status 02 . 5 . Adequate organ marrow function define : leukocyte ≥ 2,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL platelet ≥ 75,000/mcl total bilirubin &lt; 3 x institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SPGT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL cardiac ejection fraction &gt; 50 % QTc &lt; 480msec 6 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 90 day follow completion therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 12 consecutive month ) . 7 . All sit disease must evaluate within 4 week prior begin therapy . Patients must measurable disease define RECIST v1.1 . 8 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . 9 . Patients must willing undergo tumor biopsy pretreatment relapse . 1 . Subjects chemotherapy radiotherapy systemic therapy melanoma within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . No concomitant therapy allow include IL2 , interferon , ipilimumab , antiPD1 antiPDL1 antibody , cytotoxic chemotherapy , immunosuppressive agent , investigational therapy . 2 . Active infection hepatitis B C HIV . 3 . Subjects active CNS disease exclude . Patient brain metastases previously treat surgery radiation therapy confirm SD &gt; 4 week allow . 4 . Patients exclude history malignancy patient diseasefree less 2 year , exception adequately treat cured basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer carcinoma situ cervix . 5 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Cardiac symptoms event within 24 week . 6 . History predisposition retinal vein occlusion central serous retinopathy . 7 . Inability assess BRAF NRAS mutation status . Hypersensitivity digoxin . 8 . WolffParkinson White syndrome AV block sinus node dysfunction .</criteria>
