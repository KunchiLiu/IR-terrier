	<brief_summary>Vitamin D ( Vitamin D ) deficiency common . We recently show 97 % 204 patient admitted Truman Medical Center Vitamin D deficient ( &lt; 30 ng/ml ) . However , consequence Vitamin D deficiency , particularly respect infection , well understood . It known production cathelicidin , important antimicrobial peptide , critically dependent upon Vitamin D. It also establish level cathelicidin correlate inversely urinary tract infection risk . We hypothesize restoration Vitamin D level normal patient undergo major surgery result significant decrease level perioperative infection due restoration normal level circulate Vitamin D , turn elevate cathelicidin level . As initial test hypothesis , propose double-blind , prospective , randomized study pre-operative Vitamin D supplementation . Fifty subject undergoing surgery receive daily Vitamin D3 ( 50,000 IU ) five day pre-operatively , control receive placebo . Levels Vitamin D , calcium , cathelicidin , pro-inflammatory protein resistin , monitor Vitamin D supplementation ( pre-operatively ) Vitamin D supplementation ( post-operative day 1 2 ) . The effect change decrease incidence infectious complication . We expect observe Vitamin D level increase normal , cathelicidin level become elevated . We expect see increased level resistin patient develop infection . This study provide strong pilot evidence future NIH funding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapeutic Benefit Preoperative Supplemental Vitamin D Patients Undergoing Major Surgical Procedures .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long term goal research develop implement effective , evidence-and mechanism-based intervention improve outcomes surgical trauma patient . Of potential importance , finding recent pilot study establish &gt; 95 % patient see Truman Medical Center ( TMC ) seriously Vitamin D deficient plasma level significantly low normal . Our objective application , therefore , assess short term therapeutic benefit high dose Vitamin D patient admit TMC elective major abdominal surgery . We propose measure plasma Vitamin D Calcium level supplementation ( pre-operatively ) , supplementation ( post-operatively ) , monitor biomarker proteins cathelicidin resistin time . Data Vitamin D level use assess direct biochemical effect . Measurement cathelicidin level provide additional information . Since Vitamin D show induce increase expression antimicrobial protein . Monitoring circulate level resistin provide highly sensitive early measure infection ( unpublished observation ) . Calcium level also monitor since significant chance pre-operative calcium level low patient , supplementation vitamin D may increase calcium level . Measures secondary clinical outcome include length hospital stay incidence post-operation infection . Our central hypothesis , relative patient receive peri-operative standard care , patient receive 250,000 unit Vitamin D pre-operatively manifest level Vitamin D within normal range elevate level cathelicidin . We hypothesize patient receive Vitamin D reduce incidence infection , correlate low level resistin , exhibit trend toward short hospital stay . Our propose specific aim : Specific Aim # 1 : Determine biochemical consequence Vitamin D supplementation elective surgery patient We hypothesize preoperative supplementation high dose Vitamin D result level Vitamin D treat patient within normal range , correspond significant increase plasma level cathelicidin , relative control patient receive standard care . Specific Aim # 2 : Evaluate clinical benefit Vitamin D supplementation post-elective surgery patient We postulate patient give Vitamin D trend toward low rate post-surgery infection , evidence absence circulate resistin decrease detection pulmonary wound-site infection , short hospital stay relative patient receive standard care . It expectation , completion pilot study , provide strong evidence plasma level Vitamin D , measure 25-OHD , reproducibly raise normal level measure post-surgery patient administer Vitamin D detectable biochemical benefit . We expect , power propose study sufficient statistically valid result , trend toward clinical benefit Vitamin D treat patient . Collectively , finding would provide strong evidence support feasibility NIH-supported Phase I trial ass Vitamin D benefit surgery and/or trauma .</detailed_description>
