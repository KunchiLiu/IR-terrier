	<brief_summary>Isolated ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) well know congenital heart anomaly . If discover infancy early childhood surgical intervention necessity depend size defect , assure healthy adulthood . The long-term result surgical closure VSD childhood good surgery child consider equally healthy physically fit peer . However , inconsistency data regard follow-up group patient , relation exercise capacity measure cardiopulmonary function . To approach matter post-operative cardiac factor patient investigate . With study investigator intend examine long-term outcome cardiac output heart surgery VSD-patients . It present opportunity also evaluate correlation cardiac output determine gas-exchange MRI . The overall objective study 1 ) examine whether VSD-operated patient reduce cardiac output exercise comparison match control , furthermore 2 ) evaluate correlation cardiac output measure MRI cardiac output determine gas-exchange . The project design long-term follow-up method study . A cohort 20 child 1990 's underwent surgical closure congenital VSD ask participate study . An equal amount healthy young adult , function control group . Each participant complete two different exercise test , MRI heart lower body exercise supine ergometer bicycle , Supine ergometer bicycle exercise test . This data use compare cardiac output test group , furthermore allow evaluation correlation two method . VSD describe , common congenital heart anomaly . If intervene childhood , cause severe heart complication later life . It unclear whether intervention cause long-term impact patient exercise capacity , reason great importance strive improve knowledge long-term postsurgical outcome VSD-closure .</brief_summary>
