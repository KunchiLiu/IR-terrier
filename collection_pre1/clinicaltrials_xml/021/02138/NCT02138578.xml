	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria SBRT vs. RFA Randomization : Patients renal cell carcinoma le 4 cm maximum diameter , poor surgical candidate eligible randomization SBRT RFA ( Renal cell carcinoma must pathologically prove ) . The primary tumor must location amendable RFA within kidney . Patients must appropriate candidate RFA , platelets ≥50,000/mm3 international normalize ratio 1.5 . Patients must ECOG ( measurement general well activity daily live ; score range 0 5 0 represent perfect health ) score ≤ 3 . There require minimum renal function ( patient counsel possible need dialysis , applicable , would case radical partial nephrectomy ) . Patients must sign informed consent form approve purpose Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) University Michigan Medical Center indicate aware investigational aspect treatment potential risk . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . If patient randomize RFA arm , deem anesthesia candidate , he/she place nonrandomized SBRT cohort . Inclusion Criteria nonrandomized SBRT arm : Patients renal cell carcinoma le 8 cm maximum diameter , patient metastatic RCC require local palliation progress systemic disease , patient poor surgical candidate tumor location amenable RFA , patient would prefer noninvasive mean treatment eligible nonrandomized SBRT cohort ( Renal cell carcinoma must pathologically prove ) . There limitation base location primary tumor within kidney . Patients must ECOG score ≤ 3 . There require minimum renal function ( patient counsel possible need dialysis , applicable , would case radical partial nephrectomy ) . Patients must sign informed consent form approve purpose Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) University Michigan Medical Center indicate aware investigational aspect treatment potential risk .
