	<brief_summary>Capsaicinoids ( active ingredient hot pepper ) show cause moderate increase energy expenditure ( 50 kcal/day ) well reduction appetite , energy intake , ( visceral ) adiposity . As , considerable interest capsaicinoid weight loss supplement . Owing fact change believe driven catecholamine release alteration fat oxidation , grow belief capsaicin may also offer potential ergogenic benefit ( performance enhancement ) exercise , similar affect caffeine , work similar pathway . Of particular interest recent finding free-fatty acid blood elevate 2-2.5hrs post ingestion , yet change typical cardiovascular sympathetic nervous tone indicator ( heart rate , blood pressure ) unaffected , suggest negative consequence stimulant may avoid . At present , however , depth investigation effect endothelial function , vascular autonomic tone inflammation lack . Although indication capsaicinoid ingestion may alter factor associated exercise performance ( increase fat oxidation glucose spar ) , date study primarily use low exercise intensity wherein effect typically unnecessary , result generalizable typical race intensity endurance sport competition . Performance measure also noticeably absent outcome research date . Hypotheses : 1 ) , Exercise performance improve , level similar demonstrate caffeine ingestion 2 ) rating perceive exertion go effect cause intensity go 3 ) During sustain aerobic activity approach aerobic threshold alteration substrate use minimal ( possibly meaningful regard performance ) ; alteration rest pronounce . 4 ) acute alteration ( 6o min post single dose ) blood pressure , HRV , arterial stiffness RMR mirror effect observe prolonged exposure phase 1 .</brief_summary>
