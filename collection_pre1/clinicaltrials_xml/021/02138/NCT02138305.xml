	<brief_summary>Visual assessment coronary artery narrowing ( call stenosis ) see angiography conventionally use infer likely stenosis limit blood flow ( call ischemia ) condition increase demand ( e.g exercise ) . This base animal work data human simple single vessel disease co-existing condition . These data extrapolate complex patients/ complex disease clearly over-simplifies situation majority patient cardiologists treat . Pivotal work DeBruyne , Pils colleague 90 's convincingly show pressure derive measurement , call FFR , coronary artery cardiac catheterization , accurately identify stenosis would cause ischemia compare visual assessment alone . A strategy FFR guide coronary stenting drug elute stent significantly improve outcome reduce cost compare visual assessment alone ( FAME trial ) . Deferring treatment base FFR show safe ( DEFER Trial ) . FFR excellent sensitivity specificity . A FFR &lt; =0.80 use identify ischemia cause lesion 90 % time . Therefore , concept FFR guide percutaneous revascularisation treatment deferral robust evidence base support . Coronary bypass grafting ( CABG ) traditionally base solely visual assessment angiography image . SPY速 Infrared Fluorescence Angiography ( NIRF , FDA approve 2005 ) use cardiac surgeon assess patency bypass graft real-time operating room , surrogate immediate traditional coronary angiography . Dr. Ferguson observe regional myocardial perfusion ( RMP ) image data also capture video sequence . Study Hypotheses : 1 . In patient likely CABG candidate , target vessel epicardial coronary artery ( TVECAs ) FFR &gt; 0.80 demonstrate increase RMP despite anatomically patent bypass conduit SPY速 imaging . 2 . In TVECAs increase RMP SPY速 imaging , cardiac catheter laboratory measure coronary physiology TVECA , namely one combination FFR , CFR , HSR HMR , correlate SPY速 data myocardial perfusion , suggest potential mechanism physiologic response TVECA grafting .</brief_summary>
