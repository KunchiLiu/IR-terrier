	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Effect Severely Diminished Liver Function Metabolism , Safety , Tolerability Single Oral Dose Enzalutamide Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening take place Day -22 Day -2 , subject admitted clinic Day -1 . Each subject receive single oral dose enzalutamide Day 1 , fast condition . They discharge Day 7 ; ambulant visit take place Day 50 . An End Study Visit ( ESV ) occur 7-10 day last PK sample early withdrawal . Full PK profile obtain enzalutamide , metabolite 1 enzalutamide ( M1 ) metabolite 2 enzalutamide ( M2 ) 1176 hour ( Day 50 ) administration . Safety assessment perform throughout study . For subject severe hepatic impairment , additional Child-Pugh classification laboratory safety test ( include liver function test ) perform regularly administration .</detailed_description>
