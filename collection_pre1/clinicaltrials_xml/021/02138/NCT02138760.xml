	<brief_summary>Men elevate prostate specific antigen bloodtest prior negative prostate biopsy 30-60 % harbor occult prostate cancer . Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) image test may improve prostate cancer detection rate population men . In prospective randomize trial multicenter trial investigator assess detection rate prostate cancer diagnosis systematic biopsy compare addition either computer target system ( UroNav - InVivo corp ) sample suspicious area identify mpMRI versus detection rate mpMRI guide freehand biopsy ( cognitive fusion biopsy ) . The hypothesis test computerized fusion guide biopsy ( UroNav ) increase detection prostate cancer compare cognitive biopsy area systematic biopsy alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer ( PC ) second common cancer men United States , affect approximately 250,000 men per year . With advent prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) blood test , PC undergone downward stage migration result early cancer detection . In pre-PSA era , tumor present advanced stage often visible transrectal ultrasound . In modern era , tumor often microscopic apparent ultrasound image creates diagnostic challenge biopsy essentially blind . As result , many tumor miss result subsequent biopsy , tumor progression , decrease cancer-specific survival due delay diagnosis . Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) prostate become preferred imaging modality visualize prostate tumor radiographically . mpMRI become increase utilized target tumor suspicious area prostate men prior negative conventional systematic biopsy . Numerous study show MRI target biopsy result detection cancer subset men approximately 30-60 % patient ( ref ) . In addition , MRI detect high number aggressive prostate cancer would require treatment . Several method incorporate MRI biopsy target test : 1 ) gantry/in bore MRI biopsy 2 ) Robotic biopsy ( Artemis ) 3 ) UroNav ultrasound-MR fusion biopsy . The first two technique cumbersome difficult use clinical practice . The latter technology widely utilized , user patient friendly technique . UroNav utilizes work-station import MRI co-registers ( fuse ) real time ultrasound ; ultrasound transducer communicate electromagnetic receive patient allow work-station/computer target suspicious MRI lesion guide user needle appropriate 3-dimensional location . Data show effective either systematic biopsy free-MRI guide biopsy . The goal present study compare head-to-head systematic biopsy + freehand MRI target biopsy v systematic biopsy + UroNav target men elevate PSA prior negative systematic biopsy .</detailed_description>
