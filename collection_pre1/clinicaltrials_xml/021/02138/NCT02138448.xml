	<detailed_description>We develop theory-driven interactive Patient Health Record ( PHR ) use high functionality deeply engage patient health promotion . The model define five level PHR functionality : ( 1 ) collect patient information , ( 2 ) integrate electronic health record ( EHRs ) , ( 3 ) translate information lay language , ( 4 ) provide individualize , guideline-based clinical recommendation , ( 5 ) facilitating patient action . We hypothesize implement PHRs high level functionality inform activate patient way simpler PHRs achieve increase uptake preventive service . In Phase 1 , randomize 46 practice three practice-based research network eight state implement PHR advance versus simpler functionality . Control practice use exist PHR . Intervention practice upgrade PHR feature interactive preventive health record ( IPHR ) previously develop test . Intervention practice locally tailor IPHR content learn integrate new function practice . Phase 1 feature implementation assessment intervention practice , base RE-AIM model , measure Reach ( creation IPHR account patient ) , Adoption ( practice decision use IPHR ) , Implementation ( consistency , fidelity , barrier , facilitator use ) , Maintenance ( sustain use ) . The randomized comparison intervention control practice measure incremental effect IPHR share decision-making receipt cancer screen test compare traditional PHRs ( Effectiveness ) . Data source include EHR/PHR/IPHR database , patient practice survey , recruitment field note , practice learn collaborative transcript , practice diary , patient phone interview . This study inform future effort use patient-centered information technology promote cancer prevention feasibility national dissemination .</detailed_description>
