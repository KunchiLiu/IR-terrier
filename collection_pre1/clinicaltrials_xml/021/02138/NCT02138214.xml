	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well thyroid gland removal without central lymph node dissection work treat patient thyroid cancer suspect thyroid cancer spread lymph node . Currently , standard treatment thyroid cancer total thyroidectomy , complete removal thyroid . Sometimes , lymph node central part neck may also surgically remove , call central lymph node dissection . Prophylactic removal lymph node may increase risk life-threatening complication , may reduce post-surgery quality life . It may also prevent cancer return reduce need additional surgery . It yet know whether recurrence rate complication level low thyroid gland removal alone central lymph node dissection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate transient hypoparathyroidism define day 1 serum parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level &lt; 10 pg/ml SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate transient permanent hypocalcemia II . To determine rate voice swallow problem . III . To determine degree quality life ( QOL ) compromise . IV . To determine clinical recurrence rate . V. To determine degree accurate quality life measure extract patient interview narrative use natural language processing technique . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo total thyroidectomy alone . ARM II : Patients undergo total thyroidectomy ipsilateral prophylactic central neck dissection ( CND ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 1 , 2 6 week , 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
