	<brief_summary>Patients ulcerative colitis ( UC ) increase risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) compare general population . Regular screen colonoscopy internationally recommend cancer prevention strategy . Random sample mucosa throughout colon mainstay conventional surveillance practice detect abnormality , know dysplasia progress CRC . This require multiple biopsy , take process , practice tedious , expensive , time consume low pickup rate . Dysplasia UC typically flat patchy easily overlook standard conventional white light colonoscopy ( WLC ) . Detection improve application dye highlight subtle abnormality . This practice , know chromoendoscopy ( CE ) good WLC dysplasia detection time consume patient guarantee whole colon cover . CE compare clinical trial standard definition endoscopy rather recently available high definition endoscope good resolution picture . High definition ( HD ) endoscopy us high definition onitor high resolution CCD ( charge couple device ) provide much good image standard video endoscopy . HD colonoscopy promise therefore provide alternative CE UC surveillance without need extra time experience require dye spray endoscopists nurse staff . The investigator plan randomize trial ass HD colonoscopy alone compare chromoendoscopy ( HD colonoscopy ) dysplasia detection surveillance ulcerative colitis . There trial compare two modality investigator hope provide evidence additional benefit CE HD colonoscopy would marginal therefore CE would reserve procedure use standard definition scope .</brief_summary>
