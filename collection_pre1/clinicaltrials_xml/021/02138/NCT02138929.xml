	<brief_title>LDE225 + Everolimus Advanced Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign combination dose level study drug base join study . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level LDE225 . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . All participant receive dose level everolimus . This continue high tolerable combination dose LDE225 everolimus find . Up 24 participant enrol part study . Once high tolerable dose combination LDE225 everolimus find , 18 participant receive combination dose level found well tolerate earlier part study . Study Drug Administration : Every study cycle 28 day . You take 4 capsule tablet LDE225 mouth 1 time every day . Your doctor tell many capsules/tablets need take . You take study drug time glass water ( 8 ounce total ) time every day . You swallow study drug whole , one capsule/tablet every 2 minute , without chew open study drug . You eat light breakfast ( toast jam ) least 2 hour take study drug , eat drink anything least 1 hour dose . You take 2 tablet everolimus mouth 1 time every day LDE225 capsule without food . You take tablet time glass water time every day . The tablet swallow whole chewed crush . If swallow everolimus tablet , tablet dissolve water take . Add 2 tablespoon water glass . The tablet add stir gently tablet dissolve . This mixture drunk . Afterwards , glass rinse additional 2 tablespoon water drunk . Your doctor discus . If vomit take dose study drug , take another dose day . It important take study drug give study doctor tell miss dose . If forget take dose LDE225 , take soon remember ( within 6 hour miss dose ) . If 6 hour pass , skip dose take next dose next day plan . If forget take dose everolimus , skip dose take next dose next day plan . If study visit day , take dose study drug clinic . You need store LDE225 refrigerator time . Everolimus store room temperature . You share supply LDE225 everolimus anyone . You keep study drug diary help keep track study drug dos . If miss delay dose , write diary . You bring diary every study visit . At end cycle stop take part study , return leftover study drug study nurse . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Every week Cycle 1 , study staff call ask . On Day 1 Cycle 2 every 2 cycle , EKG . On Day 1 Cycle 3 every 2 cycle , CT scan MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . If doctor think need , extra blood may draw follow side effect . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit ( describe ) . End-of-Study Visit : Within 14 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test , check cholesterol level blood , check well blood clot . You need fast least 8 hour blood draw . - You EKG . - You CT scan MRI chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease , doctor think need . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Follow-Up Visit : At 30 day end-of-study visit : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You EKG . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . About 3 month follow-up visit , contact study staff telephone and/or see clinic . You ask drug may take general health . If call , call take 5-10 minute . This investigational study . LDE225 FDA approve commercially available . Everolimus FDA approve commercially available treat kidney , breast , pancreatic cancer . The combination LDE225 everolimus treat esophageal GEJ cancer investigational . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 42 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
