	<brief_title>A Phase IB Dose Escalation Study Lipocurc Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients solid tumor either fail initially respond approve chemotherapy progressive solid tumor cancer follow initial response approve chemotherapy , eligible treatment phase 1b trial ascend dos intravenous liposomal curcumin follow four week period without previous chemotherapy.The escalate dose range liposomal curcumin 100mg/M2 300 mg/M2 cohort three 6 patient , administer eight hour syringe pump weekly eight week . Safety tolerability determine drug relate adverse symptom ( ) , hematologic serologic sign clinic visit electronic communication visit . Pharmacokinetic profile follow infusion drug compare adverse change , beneficial subjective objective response . When maximum tolerate dose level reach cohort , another three patient accrue precede dose level assure tolerability subsequent phase 2 clinical trial .</detailed_description>
