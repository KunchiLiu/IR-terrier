	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess effective Xilonix treatment patient symptomatic colorectal cancer . By block substance help tumours grow spread , Xilonix therapy may slow tumour growth , also may improve symptom muscle loss , fatigue , appetite loss , pain patient colorectal cancer . The effectiveness therapy measure assess change symptom patient treat Xilonix versus treat placebo . Reversal muscle loss assess type X-ray call DEXA scanner . Improvement pain , appetite loss , fatigue measure questionnaire complete patient enrol trial .</brief_summary>
