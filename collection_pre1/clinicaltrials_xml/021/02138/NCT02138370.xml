	<brief_summary>Surgery still remain mainstay treatment localize colorectal cancer . However , nearly 30 % patient localized colorectal cancer ( stage II stage III ) present recurrence . Tumor progression mediate intrinsic genetic change extrinsic epigenetic host environmental factor , include interaction immune system . Several study demonstrate tumor infiltrate memory T-cells type , density location infiltrate T cell well predictor disease-free survival patient CRC compare standard TNM staging . These data suggest tumor invasion progression accurately predict immune response primary tumor . In addition , mismatch repair ( MMR ) -deficient tumor characterize priori high frequency tumor infiltrate lymphocyte associate significantly improve prognosis . Recently , Stotz et al show preoperative lymphocyte monocyte ratio peripheral blood sample predict clinical outcome patient stage III colon cancer . So far comprehensive analysis immune-landscape CRC . The aim current project identify comprehensive panel immunomarkers localize colorectal cancer ( stage II stage III ) applicable detection patient high risk recurrence . For first time , specific tumor-infiltrating immune cell , mismatch repair protein expression tumor tissue preoperative blood base inflammatory marker routine blood count correspond peripheral blood sample know clinicopathological feature correlate outcome 300 localized CRC patient .</brief_summary>
