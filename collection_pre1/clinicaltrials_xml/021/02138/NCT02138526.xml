	<brief_summary>Pazopanib ( Votrient ) register treatment patient advance renal cell carcinoma patient soft tissue sarcoma receive prior chemotherapy . It administer fixed oral dose 800 mg daily ( OD ) regardless size , age clinical condition . It absorb gastrointestinal tract oral bioavailability ~21 % . Pazopanib practically insoluble highly permeable . When ingested high fat food pazopanib exposure ( area concentration time curve ( AUC ) ) double . Common adverse effect diarrhea nausea . This might cause non-absorbed proportion pazopanib . A reduced dose take food could possible approach reduce side effect . Therefore investigator initially want determine equivalent reduce dose pazopanib take continental breakfast . Thereafter investigator want investigate whether intake food reduces frequently report side effect nausea diarrhea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pazopanib ( Votrient ) multi target tyrosine kinase inhibitor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor , ( VEGFR-1 , -2 en -3 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR-α -β ) , stem cell factor receptor ( c-KIT ) . Pazopanib register treatment patient advance renal cell carcinoma patient soft tissue sarcoma receive prior chemotherapy . It administer fixed oral dose 800 mg OD regardless size , age clinical condition . It absorb gastrointestinal tract oral bioavailability ~21 % . Pazopanib practically insoluble highly permeable . When ingested high fat food pazopanib exposure ( area concentration time curve ( AUC ) ) double . Common adverse effect diarrhea nausea . This might cause non-absorbed proportion pazopanib . A dose reduction ingest food could logical approach reduce side effect ; however test patient yet . Therefore want perform bioequivalent study investigate dose continental breakfast equal dose 800 mg fast condition ( study part A ) . In part B study want investigate whether intake food reduces frequently report side effect .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subjects must provide write informed consent prior performance studyspecific procedures assessment must willing comply treatment followup . Note : informed consent may obtain prior start specify screen window . Note : procedure conduct part subject 's routine clinical management ( e.g . blood count ) obtain prior signing inform consent may utilize screen baseline purpose provide procedure conduct specify protocol . 2 . ≥ 18 year old men woman use pazopanib 3 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . 4 . Adequate organ system function 1 . Poorly controlled hypertension ; systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 40 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90 mm Hg . Note : initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . Following antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment , blood pressure ( BP ) must reassess three time approximately 2minute interval . At least 24 hour must elapse antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment BP measurement . These three value average obtain mean diastolic blood pressure mean systolic blood pressure . The mean SBP / DBP ratio must &lt; 140/90 mmHg ( OR 150/90 mm Hg , criterion approve Safety Review Team ) order subject eligible study . 2 . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480msecs . 3 . History one follow cardiovascular condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Class III IV congestive heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) 4 . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding include , limited : Active peptic ulcer disease Known intraluminal metastatic lesion/s risk bleed Inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation . History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intra abdominal abscess within 28 day prior begin study treatment . 5 . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may affect absorption investigational product include , limited : Malabsorption syndrome . Major resection stomach small bowel . 6 . History cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , pulmonary embolism untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month . Note : Subjects recent DVT treat therapeutic anticoagulating agent least 6 week eligible . 7 . Major surgery trauma within 28 day prior first dose investigational product and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer ( procedure catheter placement consider major surgery ) . 8 . Evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis . 9 . Known endobronchial lesion and/or lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel increase risk pulmonary hemorrhage . Note : Lesions infiltrate major pulmonary vessel ( contiguous tumor vessel ) exclude ; however , presence tumor touching , infiltrate ( abut ) vessel acceptable ( CT contrast strongly recommend evaluate lesion ) . 10 . Recent hemoptysis ( ½ teaspoon red blood within 8 week first dose study drug ) . 11 . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric , condition could interfere subject 's safety , provision inform consent , compliance study procedure . 12 . Unable unwilling discontinue use prohibit medication least 14 day five halflives drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose day 1 duration study . 13 .
