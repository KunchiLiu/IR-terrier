	<detailed_description>Complications relate airway management major contribute factor morbidity anesthesiology . This risk complication markedly increase faced difficult airway obese patient . Pre-oxygenation create safety margin increase patient 's oxygen store , high functional residual capacity ( FRC ) . When pre-oxygenated , clinician may proceed intubation variable period apnea , maintain oxygen saturation 92 % . In non-obese individual , pre-oxygenation allows non-hypoxic apnea time eight minute . In obese population , however , non-hypoxic apnea time decrease two three minute . Different method pre-oxygenation propose order increase apnea time significant oxygen desaturation . Amongst method , follow particular interest : pre-oxygenation vital capacity , pre-oxygenation spontaneous ventilation positive pressure , pre-oxygenation elevate head positioning ( `` beach-chair '' ) . These method extensively studied individual normal height weight . The main objective pre-oxygenation raise oxygen level available alveolar level order increase non-hypoxic apnea time , significant desaturation occur . This raise alveolar oxygen concentration do maintain high inspired oxygen fraction promote large FRC oxygen reserve build pre-oxygenation phase . In morbid obese patient , parameter affect low expiratory flow , low expiratory flow close small radius airway . The final result probably come cephalad position diaphragm induced large intra-abdominal volume . Actually , different study demonstrate advantage beach-chair position non-invasive positive pressure ventilation pre-oxygenation obese patient . These advantage show short time pre-oxygenation obtain end-tidal O2 &gt; 90 % long non-hypoxic apnea time ( Sat O2 &gt; 90 % ) . Up date , publish data FRC result different combination position ventilation mode . This study evaluate FRC helium dilution technique . We propose crossover randomise trial volunteer wait bariatric surgery . We want compare , pre-oxygenation situation , without induction general anesthesia , effect three position two ventilation mode FRC measure .</detailed_description>
