	<brief_title>The Parietal Peritoneum Substitute Graft Venous Reconstruction HPB Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Improvements surgical technique , perioperative management effective chemotherapy regimen , increase resectability malignant hepatobiliary pancreatic tumor associate vascular invasion . Therefore , simultaneous vascular resection increasingly require obtain adequate resection margin improve patient definite survival . Although vascular resection associate pancreatectomy reconstructed simple venorraphy end-to-end anastomosis , segmental lateral vacular graft ( VG ) necessary 8-12 % case . Vascular reconstruction plan preoperatively vascular invasion evident appropriate VG prepare . Differents source VG available include autogenous vein , synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) , cryopreserved vein resect liver . However decision perform vascular resection may make dissection due vascular invasion injury even occasionnally take mesentericoportal vein ( MPV ) vena cava ( VC ) occlude . In emergency situation , urgent easily available graft necessary prevent prolong ischemia . The difficulty anticipate need vascular resection HPB surgery , lead certain author include group use either vein resect liver , umbilical vein parietal peritoneum ( PP ) vena cava reconstruction . The aim study evaluate safety outcome parietal peritoneum substitute patch venous reconstruction HPB surgery emergency elective situation .</detailed_description>
