	<brief_title>Dipyridamole Immune Activation HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Since HIV-infected individual start take anti-HIV medication , illness AIDS decrease , serious disease increase . Researchers think may cause increase activity immune system fight infection , lead inflammation . Inflammation normal body reaction infection . However , inflammation last long time , like HIV infection , may lead complication heart disease , cancer , liver disease , lung disease , problem think . Many HIV researcher study harmful effect prolong immune system activity inflammation possible way prevent complication . - A drug call dipyridamole approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) trade name Persantine® use drug reduce risk blood clot heart valve replacement . Laboratory study show dipyridamole also lower level immune system activity inflammation measure blood . Objectives : - To see dipyridamole affect blood lung test measure immune system activity inflammation look safety tolerability dipyridamole people infect HIV . This use dipyridamole investigational , approved FDA ; however , dose use study , 100mg four time day , dose approved FDA . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 year age old HIV infection take medication treat , low viral load ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL ) minimum 12 month . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , blood test , medical history . Women reproductive age also receive pregnancy test . - Participants take either Dipyridamole placebo 12 week . Then take Dipyridamole 12 week . - During study , participant frequent blood urine test . Dipyridamole drug level , liver kidney function test perform . HIV viral load ( amount virus blood ) also study . - Participants final follow-up visit additional 4 week . - Four brachial artery ultrasound image take . - Four pre- post-bronchodilator spirometry test perform participant enrol Version 2.0 : pre-test spirometry , participant ask inhale 4 puff albuterol , repeat spirometry post-testing . - Participants receive rectal swab screening , four flexible sigmoidoscopy rectal biopsy sigmoid colon throughout study . These study lower colon sample rectum use explore effect Dipyridamole . Participants , however , opt rectal procedure .</detailed_description>
