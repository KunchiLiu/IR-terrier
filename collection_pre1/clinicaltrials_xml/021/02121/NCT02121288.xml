	<brief_title>Adenosine-induced Myocardial Blood Flow Peripheral Artery Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect ticagrelor clopidogrel adenosine-induced myocardial blood flow ( MBF ) evaluate cardiac 13N- ammonia positron emission tomography ( PET ) rest ( baseline ) , acute dose Day 1 , short term dose Day 7 . Subjects receive ticagrelor additional pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood sample collect specific time point measure ticagrelor concentration blood . Subjects ' participation approximatetly 6 week .</detailed_description>

Need chronic oral anticoagulant therapy chronic low molecularweight heparin longterm treatment fondaparinux , warfarin , apixaban , rivoroxaban , parenteral anticoagulant enoxeparin , bivalirudin . Life expectancy &lt; 6 month base investigator 's judgment . Planned low extremity revascularization ( surgical endovascular ) vascular territory within next 3 month current ischemic ulcer gangrene . Planned major amputation due PAD within next 3 month major amputation due PAD within last 30 day . Subjects suffer stroke past 3 month . Dementia likely jeopardize understand information pertinent study conduct compliance study procedure Severe hypertension may put subject risk . Subjects consider risk bradycardic event ( e.g. , know sick sinus syndrome second third degree AV block unless already treat permanent pacemaker . Known severe liver disease ( e.g. , ascites and/or clinical sign coagulopathy ) . Renal failure require dialysis A know bleeding diathesis , haemostatic coagulation disorder , systemic bleeding , whether resolve ongoing History previous intracranial bleed time , gastrointestinal bleed within past 6 month , major surgery within 30 day ( surgical wound judge associate increase risk bleed ) .
