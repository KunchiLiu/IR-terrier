	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether primary radiotherapy omit locally advanced rectal cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) negative circumferential margin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Primary Surgery Followed Selective Radiochemotherapy Rectal Cancer With MRI Negative CRM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The preoperative radiochemotherapy fluorouracil follow surgery standard therapy patient locally advanced rectal cancer . However , necessity radiotherapy question long time especially patient enough circumferential margin . Moreover , indiscriminate radiotherapy result Irreversible ovarian dysfunction female . In past decade , two major progress colorectal cancer . Firstly , oxaliplatin fluorouracil become standard adjuvant chemotherapy advance colon cancer . Oxaliplatin improve survival colon cancer patient single fluorouracil . Our experience show oxaliplatin fluorouracil could improve prognosis rectal cancer without radiotherapy . It proven oxaliplatin add radiotherapy rectal cancer . However , whether oxaliplatin replace radiotherapy certain rectal cancer patient still unknown . Secondly , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) proven predict circumferential margin status rectal cancer . Now , preoperative MRI scan recognize rectal cancer patient low recurrence risk . The radiotherapy may omit patient low recurrence risk . This study randomize control trial compare 3-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) difference group experiment ( patient receive primary surgery follow selective radiochemotherapy ) group control ( patient receive indiscriminate preoperative radiochemotherapy follow surgery ) locally advanced rectal cancer negative MRI circumferential margin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Rectal adenocarcinoma mucinous adenocarcinoma 12 cm less anal verge . MRI scan confirm cT3N0 cT4aN0 cT14aN+ mid rectal cancer ( 126cm anal verge ) cT12N+ low rectal cancer ( 5.90cm anal verge ) . MRI scan confirm 1 mm circumferential margin . Age 1875 year old . Without distant metastasis . Malignant history . Contraindications MRI scan . Contraindications radiotherapy . Contraindications chemotherapy . Pregnancy . Multidisciplinary team think patient unsuitable take part research ( For example , obvious regional lymph node involve low rectal cancer patient think high risk recurrence ) . Refuse take part research .</criteria>
