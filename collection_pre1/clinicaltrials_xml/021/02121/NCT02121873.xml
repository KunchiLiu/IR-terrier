	<brief_summary>The objective study determine whether use minimally invasive technique gain access exfoliate ductal epithelial cell whole genome sequencing . 1 . To examine woman nipple aspiration , ductoscopy ductal lavage collect exfoliate cell two duct per woman . 2 . To collect blood sample time examination order obtain woman 's baseline genomic sequence . 3 . De-identified sample DNA RNA extract whole genome sequence transcriptome analysis perform Covance Illumina . 4 . Comparisons make within breast ( two duct ) duct blood well woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Breast Duct : Pilot Study Genomic Sequencing Exfoliated Ductal Cells Obtained Through Endoscopy Lavage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite lack anatomical clarity literature , Tibor Tot postulate breast cancer DCIS lobar disease simultaneously asynchronously appear , often multiple situ tumor focus localize within single `` sick '' lobe . This theory resonance molecular study do breast demonstrate large `` patch '' clonality even normal breast tissue . Most work base microdissection , however , assume adjacent duct profile belong lobe . In fact Cooper Going show intertwine arborize duct different independent lobe . This set stage error interpretation micro-dissected tissue . Ductal lavage allow cannulation lavage individual duct collection 1,000- 10,000 exfoliated cell study molecular genetic change . Ductoscopy add ability confirm duct perforate brush line duct increase cell yield . Real-time ultrasound use confirm ductal anatomy . With combination minimally invasive technique possible collect cell need apply new genetic technique investigate genome ductal epithelial cell . While method obtain ductal epithelial cell develop similar advance make whole genome sequence technology . KnomeÂ® , for-profit company , able analyze ductal cell blood identify variant , include single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP 's ) , short long insertion deletion ( indels ) , inversion , translocation , fusion gene copy number variation ( CNVs ) . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identify mRNA network drive pre-cancerous hyperplasia . Covance Genomics Laboratory ( CAL ) perform DNA RNA extraction , DNA QC Next-Generation Sequencing Illumina platform . With combination minimally invasive technique Next-Generation Sequencing able test hypothesis possible interrogate genetic sequence single normal duct compare sequence blood identify early epithelial mutation . In addition compare sequence two ducts one breast gain insight whether duct clonal whole breast share genetic pattern . And finally , understand pathway activate pre-cancerous duct lesion provide target intraductal treatment program .</detailed_description>
