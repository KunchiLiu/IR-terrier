	<brief_title>18F-FCH PET/MRI Assess Tumor Response Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) occur prostate cancer longer respond androgen deprivation therapy . Eventually men diagnose CRPC succumb disease . While many new therapy introduce , limitation assess treatment response physician face challenge create management strategy men CRPC . Most men present bone metastasis , accurate quantification disease burden difficult due nature conventional scan CT bone scan . In addition , standard blood PSA measurement always reflect clinical response , may lag show response . There clear need good image blood biomarkers measure disease men CRPC . This study explore benefit 18F-FCH Hybrid PET/MRI scan , Cancer Microparticle ( CMP ) Circulating Tumor Cell ( CTC ) measurement compare standard image PSA level . In study , patient receive 18F-FCH PET/MRI 18F-FCH PET/CT scan + whole body MRI baseline 12 week treatment . Serial CMP CTC blood sample take 5 study timepoints . 66 patient enrol 3 cancer centre Ontario . Patients divide 2 cohort base type treatment receive : Docetaxel Abiraterone . It hypothesize novel biomarkers well identify evaluable lesion prior therapy identify response treatment ( lack thereof ) earlier treatment period thus provide well guide treat men CRPC .</detailed_description>
