	<brief_summary>The aim study identify often gastrointestinal problem interfere quality life result treatment cancer chemotherapy . We also want identify cause symptom see simple treatment use gastrointestinal condition could make chemotherapy easy experience . Chemotherapy cancer hard work patient . Often make feel tire . Not infrequently , cause whole range physical side effect . Probably common side effect affect stomach bowel . Vomiting used major problem chemotherapy research discover whole series new treatment severe vomit chemotherapy rarely problem today . However , patient develop whole series symptom chemotherapy , example , bloating , wind , diarrhoea , need rush lavatory opening bowel frequently . The cause symptom hardly study even though sometimes affect people quite badly . In specialist gastrointestinal clinic Royal Marsden Hospital , last 12 year , pioneer new method deal symptom affect bowel radiotherapy . We would like extend method people chemotherapy . We identify several easily treatable cause symptom radiotherapy , previously often ignore . We believe cause also occur people chemotherapy knew often occur could focus improve treatment affected people . We plan find often 40 stomach bowel symptom occur chemotherapy . In people troubled symptom arrange simple series test could sort symptom occur record respond treatment .</brief_summary>

Whilst clinicians long focused management vomit pain cancer patient , less attention pay incidence , severity optimal management GI symptom . If cause symptom identify , appropriate investigation treatment prescribe . The GI Unit successfully investigate treated patient symptom emerge radiotherapy . This experience enable team develop algorithm facilitate investigation treatment cancer therapy induce symptom . The algorithm recently show effective management patient radiation induce bowel injury . In particular , enable rapid identification require investigation improve management symptom might otherwise mislabeled inevitable consequence treatment . Five easily treatable cause GI symptom far identify : - Small bowel bacterial overgrowth - Carbohydrate malabsorption - Bile acid malabsorption - Gastric bile reflux - Pancreatic insufficiency It likely additional cause viral infection ( eg cytomegalovirus ) frequent patient undergoing chemotherapy currently appreciate .</detailed_description>
