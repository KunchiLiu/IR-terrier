	<brief_title>Ambulatory v Office BP Management Usual Care Diagnosing Managing Hypertension : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The usual strategy detect hypertension—repeated office blood pressure ( BP ) measurements—is inefficient inaccurate . When paired ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) , take multitude measurement 24 hour , clear office BP measurement may convey falsely positive diagnosis know white-coat hypertension . What less well-known office BP measurement may also convey falsely negative diagnosis term masked hypertension ( MH ) . That , office BP may measure normal , yet 24-hour ambulatory measurement show elevated BP . People MH cardiovascular risk similar people diagnosed hypertension , yet MH go unrecognized , therefore , untreated . Ultimately , identify best strategy accurately detect hypertension vital improve overall BP control reduce cardiovascular event . Without feasible ABPM strategy , MH continue go unrecognized untreated . Participants enrol study randomize either usual care group ABPM-guided group . All participant baseline ABPM . ABPM use make diagnosis determine anti-hypertensive treatment ABPM-guided group . Participants ABPM-guided group follow-up ABPM 2 month . All participant final ABPM 4 month enrollment .</detailed_description>
