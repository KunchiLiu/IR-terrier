	<brief_title>Epidural Catheter With Without Adductor Canal Nerve Block Postoperative Analgesia Following Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Knee replacement surgery become increasingly common United States hundred thousand surgery perform yearly across country . Despite , consensus `` standard care '' optimum pain control regimen surgery . Pain management TKA range local tissue injection patient control anesthesia regional nerve block neuraxial anesthesia . Although regional anesthesia become common widespread , wide variation depend practice setting ( academic versus private ) , equipment available ( adductor nerve block require ultrasound guidance ) , level training anesthesiologist patient selection , among factor . Another part reason wide variation practice lack literature demonstrate clear effectiveness superiority one technique another . To date adductor canal nerve block mainly study comparison femoral nerve block term efficacy control pain ability preserve motor function . Adductor canal nerve block show literature effective method postoperative pain control total knee replacement surgery . One unique benefit particular technique adductor canal nerve block primarily sensory block , thereby control pain without impair motor strength . This useful total knee replacement surgery pain control quadriceps muscle strength preserve . With well function muscle patient able fully participate physical therapy less strength impairment reduce risk fall . It aim investigate one multimodal approach combine strengths two proven pain management technique thereby improve overall postoperative pain control patient satisfaction . Our hope establish protocol safe effective patient care .</detailed_description>
