	<brief_summary>Background When patient anesthetise undergoes operation , body temperature fall . Managing body temperature properly keep within normal limit show improve recovery surgery . A vital part manage temperature able measure properly . There several way , consist invasive method temperature probe oesophagus bladder , non invasive method infrared scanner ear canal probe . During operation , temperature change small 0.5 °C affect outcome , currently , invasive method reliable enough detect . Oesophageal probe ca n't use patient anaesthetised operation , inappropriate insert urinary catheter otherwise need . The purpose study look two new method measure patient 's temperature would help u situation . The first call zero-flux thermometry involve place adhesive pad forehead , give constant measurement patient 's core temperature . The second involve swallow ingestible capsule big normal pill . This technique useful research track patient 's core temperature transfer different area longer period time . Whilst two method potentially useful , never test hospital patient . Aims : The investigator want determine whether reading thermometer accurate enough used patient , surgery . Should prove sufficiently accurate allow u improve patient care clinical practice research . Plan : During operation , temperature routinely measure line NICE guideline thermometer place nose oesophagous . The investigator change routine practice way , check measurement new device proven , routine one . The investigator plan record measurement device every minute throughout operation 20 patient . The investigator perform statistical test check accuracy . Study Hypothesis : Zero flux ingestible thermometer significantly different detect patient body temperature oesophageal temperature probe</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary : The study design provide information suitability accuracy two method temperature measurement perioperative period . Background : Good perioperative temperature management important mean improving patient outcome [ 1 ] . An essential part optimal management accurate temperature measurement . The gold standard pulmonary artery catheter ( PAC ) measurement . However , use infrequently British practice due high rate associate complication . Urinary bladder oesophageal temperature sufficiently accurate unsuitable many patient [ 2 ] . For example possible use oesophageal probe awake patient many patient catheterise . Although non-invasive relatively cheap mean measure temperature ( aural canal probe infrared scanner ) exist , neither accurate consistent enough distinguish 0.5˚C difference significant effect patient outcomes [ 2 ] . In study , investigator plan look two method temperature measurement potentially offer significant improvement surgical care . The first new method know zero-flux thermometry . This completely non-invasive , involve place adhesive pad forehead . Connected monitor , equilibrate patient 's core temperature give constant read-out . The second ingestible capsule . These become important tool measure hypothermia hyperthermia setting . Their accuracy , however , test hospital patient . This technology , although expensive routine use , offer significant advantage research provide constant record temperature throughout patient 's stay hospital . For example , investigator ' audit data show patient admit fractured neck femur become hypothermic time , mortality increase . Subsequent show patient temperature drop significantly ambulance , A &amp; E admission ward . These part patient journey possible target prevention hypothermia continuous monitoring offer device allow u accurately test efficacy intervention . Aims objectives : The aim study determine accuracy perioperative period zero-flux ingestible temperature reading . Previous study show oesophageal nasopharyngeal measurement take accurate reflection core temperature [ 2 ] . The consistency accuracy two compare . Plan investigation : This study purely observational . There interference current practice . Nasopharyngeal/oesophageal probe routinely place , accord NICE guideline , patient . The zero-flux thermometer non-invasive ingestible capsule big pill , neither provide additional risk patient . Temperature reading download three device maximum interval 1 minute . The investigator calculate reading 15 subject provide sufficient power . The investigator plan recruit 20 patient . Analysis agreement method perform suggested Bland Altman [ 3 ] .</detailed_description>
