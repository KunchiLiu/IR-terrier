	<detailed_description>AKI common severe complication critically ill patient , associate increased morbidity mortality well high cost medical care . Despite effort standardize definition classification AKI , still inconsistency application criterion limitation serum creatinine urine output detect AKI generally recognize medical community . In future , biomarkers renal cell injury may identify additional patient AKI may identify majority patient earlier stage . NGAL ( neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin , lipocalin-2 , siderocalin ) biomarker . It small protein express neutrophil certain epithelium , include renal tubule . Renal expression NGAL dramatically increase kidney injury variety cause , NGAL release urine plasma . NGAL level rise within two hour insult , make NGAL early sensitive biomarker kidney injury . Due heterogeneous implementation AKI definition classification , uniform definition apply investigation , ensure comparative result enrollment site . The aim study validate assign NGAL cutoff value compare clinical diagnosis AKI determine current clinical practice US . The study sit enroll consecutive patient meet criterion ICU critical care set . Patients give standard clinical care lab-work . Each day , one additional urine two additional plasma sample draw frozen . These additional sample ship Sponsor retrospective NGAL measurement . The duration subject´s participation discharge ICU , maximum 8 day , whichever come first . In addition serum creatinine value continue collect manually hospital data system 48 hour discharge ICU . ( If subject ICU 8 day , follow value collect patient still ICU ) . 250 subject enrol total three investigator site . At least 40 patient must enrol site . The NGAL value match `` clinical diagnosis '' acute kidney injury ( AKI ) specify KDIGO® guideline . The clinical diagnosis assign three-person adjudication panel base entry eCRF investigator . Adjudicators blind investigation site , AKI-diagnosis treat physician , NGAL value . A comparison AKI diagnosis base cutoff value 250 ng/mL clinical diagnosis assign majority adjudication panel conduct . Primary endpoint : - Sensitivity NGAL test estimate proportion patient observe NGAL value equal 250 ng/ml among patient classify AKI , . - Specificity NGAL test estimate proportion patient observe NGAL value 250 ng/ml among patient classify AKI</detailed_description>
