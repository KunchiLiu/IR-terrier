	<detailed_description>In practice orthopedic outpatient surgery , one intractable problem proper control post-operative analgesia . Pain frequent cause consultation unscheduled readmission group patient . The use continuous peripheral nerve block effective tool postoperative analgesia , allow prolong effect blockade time want . Such technique describe different group management postoperative pain good result even successfully use ambulatory practice . However , send patient home continuous infusion pump local anesthetic cause problem , method administration , cost risk poison drug . With regard method administration , use electronic continuous infusion pump even allow bolus demand , good result . However , use implies higher cost difficult use patient . An alternative great simplicity low cost use disposable pump ( elastomeric pump ) without electronic component , simple mechanism allow predetermine continuous infusion flow . It see use elastomeric pump continuous peripheral nerve block associate few technical problem satisfy patient electronic pump . Another problem occur use ambulatory continuous technical risk secondary administration local anesthetic solution long-acting toxicity home environment , without immediate medical intervention . While potential risk toxicity , problem could avoid use less toxic drug . In connection , study continuous infusion local anesthetic perineural catheter make bupivacaine , levobupivacaine , ropivacaine . However , find lidocaine last le action , low cost less toxic long-acting agent , although study continuous infusion lidocaine home . In addition , evidence comparable effectiveness solution bupivacaine lidocaine continuous epidural infusion postoperative analgesia , lidocaine likely good alternative continuous ambulatory block . Therefore , investigator objective compare effectiveness lidocaine versus bupivacaine ambulatory popliteal sciatic blockade continuous elastomeric pump .</detailed_description>
