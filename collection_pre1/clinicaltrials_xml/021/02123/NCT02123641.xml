	<brief_summary>A minimum 450 healthy individual ( 62-70 year old ) recruit . Each individual randomize one three group stratify accord gender ( M/F ) , BMI ( ≤28/ &gt; 28 ) , 30 sec chair stand ( ≤11/ &gt; 11 ) . The three group Heavy resistance training ( n=150 ) , moderate intensity training ( n=150 ) , control ( n=150 , train ) . Assessments perform baseline , 12 month intervention . Furthermore , follow perform 2,4,7 , 10 year . The primary outcome change leg extensor power intervention follow . The primary hypothesis apply intention-to-treat analysis , moderate intensity train group increase leg extensor power much heavy resistance train group . The two training group increase muscle power control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Physical Activity Intervention Against Age-related Loss Muscle Mass Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retirement recognize critical turning point determine physical activity behaviours old age . The literature give vary picture regard change physical activity level work retirement often reduction total physical activity report . Retirement typically take place time skeletal muscle mass , -strength -power decline 1-3 % per year . Interventions promote physical activity adult age 55 70 year show effective 12 month unclear effect maintain thereafter . Both exercise home center improve health physical function - home base program appear superior center base program term adherence exercise especially long-term . In old adult , strength train 60 % 1RM show sufficient large effect muscle function muscle protein synthesis , potentially low load ( 45-60 % 1RM ) effect add repetition . The overall objective study ass long-term effect 12 month supervise high-intensity center base resistance train `` guide '' moderate-intensity home-based resistance training relative non-exercising control group upon muscle power , -strength -mass , physical function , physical activity level health old people around time retirement . The hypothesis : 1 . Supervised high-intensity center base resistance train one year result best improvement muscle power bodily function 2 . `` Guided '' moderate-intensity home-based resistance training result active lifestyle thus sustain elevated activity level 1-year intervention period . Thus long run ( several year ) `` guide '' moderate-intensity home-based resistance training superior effect compare supervise high-intensity center base resistance train upon functional ability , health potentially also cognitive function . 450 participant recruit advertisement local newspaper include three-armed , single-blinded randomized trial . After baseline assessment randomize one year 1 ) supervise , high-intensity progressive , resistance training conduct machine three time weekly local fitness center 2 ) `` guide '' moderate-intensity home-based resistance training conduct elastic band body weight three time weekly . `` Guided '' mean participant offer supervised resistance train weekly addition home base resistance training 2 time weekly 3 ) various social cultural activity require physical activity . All participant complete wide range test 12 month intervention period primary time point outcome assessment 12 month . The `` test battery '' conduct subsequent year ( 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 year later ) follow-up .</detailed_description>
