	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Basiliximab , Delayed Dose Tacrolimus Plus ECMPA Following Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since basiliximab work receptor system tacrolimus show cause significant adverse effect , nephrotoxicity cytokine release syndrome , investigator propose induction therapy basiliximab liver transplant patient concomitant preoperative renal dysfunction . This combat acute rejection allow delay tacrolimus therapy post-operative day # 7 . The delay tacrolimus therapy allow renal function improve reduce chance continue renal dysfunction . Also , addition basiliximab immunosuppressive regimen allow reduction tacrolimus dose ( normal tacrolimus concentration UCLA 7-10ng/mL . Our goal 3-5ng/mL ) immediate post-transplant period thereby reduce chance acute long-term efficacy-limiting adverse effect associate tacrolimus maintain adequate immunosuppression reduce acute rejection episode . This would convince prospective randomize study utilize basiliximab renal sparing agent liver transplantation . Objectives Primary objective â€¢ To evaluate renal recovery/ function follow OLT patient undergo orthotopic liver transplant 6 12 month post-transplant . Secondary objective ( compare two treatment arm ) - To determine tolerability adverse event profile first year post-transplant . - To determine incidence severity acute rejection episodes - To determine incidence death and/or graft failure within first year post-transplant Study design The study single center prospective randomize trial wherein investigator two group . Patients screen eligible patient enrol pre-transplant . Patients randomized time transplant either control treatment arm . Post transplant laboratory data ( chemistry , tacrolimus level liver function test ) collect daily basis . For duration patient ' hospital stay ( average 2-3 week ) . This provide early data set early post operative result . Patients subsequently follow weekly outpatient basis upon discharge per protocol . During visit , laboratory data ( chemistry , tacrolimus level liver function test ) also collect provide continue flow data follow analysis . Any evidence rejection prompt treatment rescue therapy necessary disenrollment study . Study Population In 1:1 fashion , 60 patient ( inpatient outpatient ) meeting preset criterion await liver transplantation randomize UCLA Medical Center part exploratory study . Each patient follow 1 year post-transplant . Patients may consent 30 day prior transplantation . Patients screen study 7 day prior transplantation 7 day prior randomization . Patients evaluate base inclusion exclusion criterion depict study protocol assign patient number eligible study entry . Patient must meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion day study entry . Clinical Assessments - Weight , height blood pressure ( sit position 5 minute ) - Concomitant medication - Pre-existing clinical condition - Laboratory evaluation ( Appendix 2 ) : - Complete blood count ( CBC ) - Chemistry Panel : glucose , Na , K , Cl , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , Ca , P , Mg , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , albumin total protein , serum creatinine - Hepatic Profile : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , bilirubin ( total direct ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) - Urinary protein creatinine concentration - Calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) ( Appendix 1 ) - Pregnancy test ( serum beta- human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) sensitivity must equal 50 milli-International unit ( mIU ) / millilitre ( mL ) ) , document within 7 day prior randomization - Lipid Panel Inclusion criterion Patients eligible inclusion study fulfill follow criterion : - &gt; 18 year old - Undergoing first second OLT - Meld score &gt; 25 - Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ongoing hemodialysis le 4 week time transplant - Able agreeable conform requirement study - Patients proxy must give write informed consent assessment perform . Exclusion criterion - &lt; 18 year old - Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 - MELD Score &lt; 25 - Ongoing hemodialysis 4 week ( patient become eligible renal transplant point per UCLA practice ) . - Receiving Muromonab-cluster differentiation 3 ( OKT3 ) , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) therapy around time transplant - Participating another clinical research study involve evaluation another investigational drug device - Prior document allergy study medication - Active Fungal infection Treatment Investigational control drug Investigational drug , Basiliximab investigational drug supply Novartis 20 mg vial Control drug , Mycophenolate/ Mycophenolic acid delay release ( provide Novartis 360 mg tablet ) / Tacrolimus/ corticosteroid use arm control drug . For subject unable tolerate po medication , mycophenolate mofetil oral suspension supply regular commercial supply administer via nasogastric tube . Treatment arm Patients assign one follow 2 treatment arm ratio 1:1 Adverse event Subjects carefully monitored adverse event . This monitoring include clinical Laboratory test . Adverse event assess daily basis accord clinical practice . Adverse event assess term term seriousness , severity , relationship study drug . All unexpected severe adverse event review Principle Investigator . The PI also continuously monitor number patient respective follow-up period perform require toxicity evaluation interval assure conduct trial complies protocol design . Study conduct timeliness accuracy data monitor regularly first 12 patient trial . The PI submit appropriate safety report need throughout study period . Data review database management Data collection Data collect per study protocol prospectively record case report form ( CRF ) study coordinator . The principle investigator oversee process . Database management quality control The study coordinator responsible data management/accuracy supervision principle investigator . Data analysis ( Any section may include base type study ) Populations analysis All patient consent enrolled analyzed . Patient demographics/other baseline characteristic No specific patient demographic aside inclusion/exclusion criterion Treatments ( study drug , rescue medication , concomitant therapy , compliance ) Study coordinator conduct pill count return visit clinic ascertain compliance discharge . Analysis primary objective ( ) Variable The primary efficacy endpoint renal function measure epidermal growth factor receptor ( eGFR ) calculate use abbreviate MDRD-4 formula 6 12 month post-transplantation . Statistical analysis : Baseline comparison - The investigator confirm randomization successful compare potential predictor baseline age , hepatitis C ( HCV ) status ( yes/no ) , baseline MELD score , pre transplant dialysis duration , bypass ( yes/no ) status two arm . The investigator also compare gender ethnicity . If important potential confounder clinically different beyond chance different ( statistically significant ) two group , consider use adjustment described . Primary outcome - Renal function The investigator use repeat measure analysis variance model original transform ( possibly log ) scale non parametric analog ( Friedman procedure ) compare mean/median profile continuous kidney function outcome ( GRR , serum Cr , Cr clearance , time dialysis ) two group time . The investigator report mean/median absolute value well absolute percent change baseline time group . While anticipate randomization successful , needed investigator extend repeat measure model general regression model random patient effect ( mixed model ) use confounders covariates . Alternately , convenient regression model identify , create adjustment stratum base confounders compute stratum adjust means/medians . The investigator report unadjusted covariate adjust value necessary . Secondary outcome - Time event The investigator use Kaplan-Meier method correspond log rank test compare time event curve time first acute graft rejection ( ie percent rejection free ) well patient graft survival . The investigator use Cox proportional hazard model , need , adjust covariates different two arm . The investigator carry similar analysis cluster differentiation 25 ( CD25 ) level appropriate scale . Adverse event - The investigator report proportion severity patient adverse event time score none , mild , moderate severe ( 0-3 ) . The investigator use non parametric Freedman method compare score distribution group across time . Dropouts - The investigator anticipate 5 % dropout . However , compare baseline variable age MELD score determine drop random comparable two group . If , comment direction possible bias . The maximum likelihood repeat measure model give unbiased estimate correct standard error dropouts random . Potential benefit participant Group 1 include improve renal function reduce chance continue renal dysfunction delay tacrolimus therapy . Participants possibly maintain adequate immunosuppression reduce acute rejection episode . Group 2 receive standard care increase post-transplant monitoring study team .</detailed_description>
