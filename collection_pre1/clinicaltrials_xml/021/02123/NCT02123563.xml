	<brief_summary>Diabetes obesity affect many people different country . Similarly , million people type gum disease gingivitis . The present study conduct clarify systemic condition diabetes obesity could impair response gingivitis treatment . Subjects gum disease show diabetes type II ( 40 50 subject ) , slight moderate obesity ( 40 50 subject ) combination ( 40 50 subject ) select present study . In addition normal-weight subject gum disease ( 40 50 subject ) besides group without gum disease ( 40 50 subject ) select comparison . After verbal write explanation study , subject match study criterion sign informed consent form underwent full oral examination two separate visit . In first visit , clinical examination verify level gingival inflammation accumulate amount dental plaque , bone height determine X-Ray examination . Bad breath also evaluate chair-side apparatus . Additional laboratorial examination include ) quantification bacteria cause gum disease dental plaque sample , b ) quantification inflammatory product gingival fluid sample c ) quantification produce saliva . Self-report questionnaire use check impact oral condition treatment gum disease quality life individual daily performance . These examination repeat 3 month dental treatment . All subject receive ultrasonic dental prophylaxis clean teeth . Based systemic/oral condition group rinse either essential-oils containing mouth rinse placebo rinse . First rinse supervise one perform home twice day three month . Each participant also receive toothbrush , dental floss fluoride toothpaste monthly oral hygiene instruction . Adherence treatment occurrence undesirable side effect monitor throughout study .</brief_summary>
