	<brief_summary>Urolithiasis ( kidney stone ) common disease process affect people across world . Usually , stone size small , able pas urinary system exit bladder treatment . However , size stone big , get trap kidney ureter , cause significant pain patient potentially obstructing urine flow . If occurs , surgical treatment necessary removal stone . The surgical procedure often employ involves use ureteroscope , device include camera channel work instrument grasper laser fiber place procedure . Ureteroscopes currently use flexible ability treat stone may otherwise inaccessible kidney . Most flexible ureteroscopes clinical use currently one channel therefore allow one instrument use time . Recently , new type ureteroscope introduce market offer advantage two work channel two instrument insert use stone treating procedure . This potentially decrease procedure time patient affect kidney stone . The purpose research compare efficacy safety ureteroscopes one channel instrument insertion newer ureteroscope two channel utilization stone treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multi-Center Comparison Dual Lumen Versus Single Lumen Ureteroscopes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design This study prospective , multi-institutional randomize controlled trial compare single lumen dual lumen ureteroscopes . Specifically , new double-lumen ureteroscope compare multicenter trial currently exist single-lumen ureteroscopes patient undergo ureteroscopy stone kidney ureter . Patient Recruitment Randomization All patient present Department Urology University California , Irvine , University Toronto North Shore-LIJ Health System require flexible ureteroscopy treatment kidney ureteral stone disease approach enrolment study , assume inclusion exclusion criterion detail met . After discussion study potential participant , interested party give copy consent form . The investigator review explain consent form potential subject . All information study provide . Ample time give individual ask question regard participation question answer prior signing consent form . If desire , interested give copy consent form take home may opportunity discuss participation family and/or advisor . If individual chooses enroll , consent form sign procedure begin . Once individual join study inform consent obtain , subject receive sign copy consent form . Individuals may choose enrol study may withdraw study time without repercussion subsequent care . Patients agree participate study randomize day surgery . Stratified block randomization utilize balance number patient different stone size ( &gt; 1cm , &lt; 1cm ) , kidney , proximal distal ureteral stone two group . Device description The Wolf Cobra Richard ( Wolf Endoscopy , Vernon Hills , IL ) , dual-lumen flexible ureteroscope currently exist device two work channel utilized operating room . Wolf Cobra shaft size 9.9F . Each Cobra 's two channel 3.3 F size ( small compare regular ureteroscopes 3.6F ) give large total cross-sectional area two combine together . Atraumatic 6 Fr . distal tip dilate 9.9 Fr . sheath ease entry . A dual-channel ureteroscope may provide several advantage . Having additional work channel enable good irrigation single-channel ureteroscope . It achieve continuous inflow outflow , might significantly , improve intraoperative visualization maintains clear field view efficient cleaning blood , debris , stone , even utilize multiple instrument simultaneously . Usually , multiple pass different instrument require surgeon reposition ureteroscope order change instrument potentially reduce efficiency increase length operative time . The second working channel allow surgeon use multiple instrument simultaneously maintain flow efficiently treat stone pathology ( Figure 1 ) . This feature may offer technical advantage Outcomes Preoperatively , patient undergo diagnostic imaging ( CT , KUB , US ) identify stone burden location . Follow image standardize across participate institution include CT KUB image procedure identify residual stone . The primary outcome study procedure time ( minute ) . This measured start endoscopic access end procedure include complete fragmentation stone fragment removal . The follow data also record serve secondary outcome : 1 . Stone clearance rate ( Will define URS postoperative imaging ) 2 . Total ureteroscopy time 3 . Stone fragmentation time ( time record start first lithotripsy till complete stone fragmentation ) 4 . Stone clearance time 5 . Overall procedure time ( include positioning , URS procedure , extubation ) 6 . Requirement second procedure 7 . Intraoperative complication 8 . Immediate postoperative complication 9 . Postoperative complication within 30 day procedure 10 . Surgeon 's opinion comfort ( rank 1-10 ? ) 11 . Visibility use questionnaire rank 1 10 . 12 . Ureteroscope durability Additionally , patient demographic clinical characteristic age , gender , Charlson comorbidity index , ASA , BMI , previous medical surgical history collect . Stone characteristic size , location , density ( HU ) record . For patient , three ( width , length depth ) large diameter stone measure preoperative CT volume calculate accurate stone measurement . All preoperative postoperative outcome compare base stone characteristic size , location type stone ( HU ) Deflection Angles New single lumen double lumen ureteroscopes use purpose study . To avoid confound factor , scope use exclusively patient involve trial . Every week ureteroscope assess maximal deflection , define angle tangent deflection point tip ureteroscopes , describe Monga Parkin9,10 . In order calculate angle , photocopy ureteroscope maximal deflection take . Both upward downward angle deflection measure three time mean value subsequently calculate type ureteroscope prior first usage . These measurement perform week usage . After last case study , maximal angle deflection two type ureteroscopes measure compare measurement begin study . Fatigability Fatigability give ureteroscope define decrease maximum amount deflection tip4 . The fatigability ureteroscope measure subtract mean value maximal deflection end study maximum deflection measure begin study . Subjective Assessments After procedure , surgeon performs endoscopic procedure ask rate image quality scope fill questionnaire 1-10 ( 1 poor 10 excellent visualization ) . These subjective assessment investigator secondary outcome . Additionally , ease deflection overall scope performance ask . Once ureteroscope reach point require repair , ship manufacture company . The reason repair record , type cost repair document .</detailed_description>
