The study involve three clinical site , The University Alabama , Birmingham ; The Henry Ford Health System ; Mount Sinai Medical Center , develop independent intervention experimentally compare number positive Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) diagnose find use birth-cohort screening approach find use traditional risk-based screening , standard care strategy . Birth cohort test define systematic recommendation HCV antibody test person born year 1945 1965 clinically document evidence prior antibody test without regard patient 's state risk exposure virus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Birth-Cohort Evaluation Advance Screening Testing Hepatitis C ( BEST-C ) compare effectiveness birth cohort HCV screen strategy current risk-based HCV screen approach detect previously unidentified person viral hepatitis C receive health care primary care system . BEST-C fund site implement birth-cohort test clinic sample primary care patient use experimental design compare effect birth-cohort test test rate identify prevalence case control sample . Additional data collect assess linkage care test positive , feasibility , acceptance new strategy medical staff , cost effectiveness , patient impact . The site use three model measure net effect change : One site use study coordinator actively screen recruit patient meet inclusion criterion birth-cohort screening . Study coordinator locate two internal medicine clinic , approach eligible participant person . A control group pull additional two internal medicine clinic , screen use risk-based strategy . A cluster randomize cross-over approach use , intervention control clinic switch midpoint data collection , allow four clinic participate arm study . A second site reach directly patient use direct communication mail . Mailers contain HCV guideline , importance screening , laboratory slip location patient act directly behalf . This site use simple randomization patient use health system past , meet definition birth-cohort membership ( born 1945 1965 ) previously test positive hepatitis C. The patient receive 5 mailing include prepaid , lab registration form instruct bring affiliated lab location test . A third site implement physican best practice alert Epic electronic health record system clinic setting . This site pop-up enable Medical Assistants ( MAs ) ask pend lab order chart clinician . When MAs open chart arrive , untested patient , alert pend Hepatitis C antibody test order enter patient vitals prior patient see physician . When clinician subsequently open patient chart , lab order present order section chart signature execution deletion depend circumstance patient encounter . As back-up pathway alert physician directly event MA bypass open prompt . This alert detail CDC recommendation age-based screen link proper Hepatitis C antibody test order diagnosis code address patient . This site use cluster randomize experimental design physicians MA 's specific primary care practice consent study . Experimental cluster receive education HCV test implement best practice alert . Control cluster receive education HCV testing .</detailed_description>
