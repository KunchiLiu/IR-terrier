	<brief_title>Chronic Low Back Pain Patients ' Expectations Toward Physiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) define `` pain discomfort , localise costal margin inferior gluteal fold , without refer leg pain '' persist least 12 week . It classify non-specific `` attributable recognisable , know specific pathology , disorder , radicular syndrome cauda equina syndrome '' . It frequent condition , one year prevalence around 25 % men 35 % woman . It greatly alter functional capacity quality life . Including care , sick leave work loss , account back pain related cost . Recommended management CLBP multidisciplinary due biopsychosocial impact condition . Most guideline include patient 's education , advice stay active , anti-inflammatory analgesic medication , exercise therapy , spinal manipulation . Multidisciplinary rehabilitation , adjunctive analgesic , cognitive behavioural therapy recommend initial approach efficient . Self-management strategy , self-monitoring status , decision-making also promote . Physiotherapy play role CLBP management , collaboration health social profession . As defined World Confederation Physical Therapy , `` Physiotherapy provide service individual population develop , maintain restore maximum movement functional ability throughout lifespan . ( … ) Functional movement central mean healthy ( … ) .This encompass physical , psychological , emotional , social wellbeing Local international standard physiotherapy practice advocate take patient ' expectation consideration . Physiotherapists also advise take patient preference account , apply evidence-based practice ( EBP ) guideline . However , knowledge expectation patient toward physiotherapy limit . This research conduct interdisciplinary approach . Indeed , take account physiotherapy anthropological discipline . Physiotherapists want deepen comprehension patient ' need order take good care whereas anthropologist interested broad experience chronic illness understand relationship care patient . With concept qualitative method , latter relevant tool answer research question . Expectations issue within CLBP rehabilitation process Commonly , expectation understand `` belief someone achieve something '' . In health field literature , notion expectation often use , although seldom define . Nevertheless , three dimension emerge literature CLBP patient ' expectation : effectiveness care ( diagnosis , effective treatment , pain relief ) , relational issue ( understanding , partnership , believe , treat person ) , empowerment ( self-management , exercise , advice , explanation , etc ) . In addition , expectation appear influenced course , prognosis outcome rehabilitation . CLBP patient often dissatisfy back pain rehabilitation . As pain relief slight , disappointment outcome frequent . Having clear diagnosis clearly expect . Thus , additional medical investigation frequently request find cause disease . The patient also expectation regard outcome . Health professional expect demonstrate communication skill , understand emotional physical impact , spend time patient , show respect build partnership . They also expect understand personal situation , demonstrate empower skill , adapt language . The nature CLBP thus put health professional uncomfortable position . The diagnostic uncertainty limited effect therapy challenge competency . The professional recommendation advise avoid complex investigation stay active despite pain . This position may difficult patient wish obtain clear diagnosis prescribe time rest example . Thus , unrecommended approach sometimes implement maintain relationship patient . Patients ' expectation diagnosis cure line biomedical approach , biopsychosocial model applies CLBP treatment . It require subtle interaction bring patient consider psychosocial issue influence pain disability without give impression pain `` mind '' exaggerate . This especially difficult context person feel delegitimized . Indeed , disbelief delegitimization health professional motif dissatisfaction . Unclear diagnosis poor social recognition In Social science , study explore experience CLBP patient show , since face long term diagnostic uncertainty , place liminal state well sick , neither . Struggling diagnosis important source strain add experience pain , alter mood functional limitation . Medical validation pain perform medical imagery non-specific CLBP , relation finding pain low . Following anthropological distinction disease , illness sickness , patient , find `` illness '' ( subjective experience suffering ) , without `` disease '' ( medical definition affection ) `` sickness '' ( social construction recognition ) . Lack clear body damage explain pain lead absence social recognition sick person need support society . Living CLBP : biographical disruption Chronic symptom lead feel hopelessness , depression , anger loss self identity . The loss social role , status identity induce chronic illness document medical socio-anthropology . As show socio-anthropological study chronic illness , biographical disruption illness appear . The CLBP patient manage life accounting pain . Self-image alter feeling self-discrepancy , i.e . difference ideal perceive self , may experience . Some patient feel hold responsible suffering , physician situate origin pain `` mind '' absence identify body damage . Patients often consider physician n't admit limitation medicine . Persons unexplained pain , speak solve riddle ca n't resign consider `` imagined pain '' . They often convince concreteness pain , since `` ca n't hurt bad nothing wrong '' . Some complain `` let '' quest explain cope situation . Although study show importance take account live situation trajectory ill person since begin illness , make little articulation trajectory ill person ' expectation towards caregiver . In study investigator assume strong link aspect . For instance , duration illness , level disability , impact quality life , previous recourse therapist treatment necessarily produce variation patient ' expectation towards physiotherapist . Research aim The main aim study identify CLBP patient ' expectation toward physiotherapy physiotherapist . The investigator aim provide qualitative insight factor influence expectation relate experience element context appear . The element account include representation CLBP , physiotherapy therapist , illness trajectory , socio-economic characteristic , technique perceive relationship physiotherapist . Expectations investigate begin end intensive rehabilitation program seize experience answer and/or modifies patient 's expectation . Methodology Design : individual interview observation Interviews patient observation patient-physiotherapist interaction plan . Interviews Individual comprehensive interview common method provide account experience illness . The investigator use semi-structured interview base guide question . Interviews conduct anthropologist research team . Interviews last around 1 hour . They take place ill person 's home he/she agree . At begin process , 4 pilot interview two individual session ( observation ) run refine question procedure , well adjust unplanned practical issue . Two interview take place , one beginning rehabilitation program , second end . Both interview conduct researcher . Observations With aim triangulation data , interview complete observation relationship patient physiotherapist . The observation take place back rehabilitation unit university hospital . Patients follow 3 week intensive CLBP rehabilitation program . Focus put individual therapy session . More specifically , first last session program observe . The investigator choose ten patient among twenty participant use purposive sampling process . These observation conduct two anthropologist research team . Following observation , member research team meet debrief session , share vision anthropologists physiotherapist mean event . This assure take account socio-anthropological concept physiotherapist ' knowledge field interdisciplinary approach .</detailed_description>
