Data Collection : After provide informed consent demonstrate approval exercise physician-signed copy Physical activity readiness medical examination ( PARMED X ) 69 Physical activity readiness questionnaire ( PAR-Q+ ) 69 , participant complete demographic questionnaire include sex , height , weight , age , general fitness level , manual wheeling experience . After complete questionnaire , participant fit appropriately size Elevation wheelchair ( Instinct Mobility , Vancouver , BC ) . Participants fit elbow form angle approximately 100 degree hand place top wheel seat wheelchair . To ensure consistency across measurement point , detail wheelchair fit record reproduced post-testing minimize bias . The instrumented measurement wheel collect kinetic temporal variable ( SmartWheel -Three Rivers Holdings , Mesa , AZ ) exchange right wheel wheelchair inertia-matched dummy wheel apply left side wheelchair . Tire pressure inflate recommend level 100 psi . A drag test perform determine drag force wheelchair-user system treadmill ( Max-Mobility ) . During drag test , participant sit passively fitted-laboratory wheelchair , connect rope force transducer . At constant speed ( 1.1 m/s 4.0 km/h ) , angle treadmill increase 10 step ( 0.5 % grade ) , angle , drag force determine . These 10 force measurement use calculate power output ( PO ) angle inclination treadmill . A linear regression use determine PO ( calculate multiply drag force velocity accord PO ( W ) = drag force ( N ) · belt velocity ( m/s ) ) . The drag test take approximately 5 minute complete . Safety strap locate side wheelchair treadmill attach front Elevation wheelchair ( metal frame front caster wheel ) . Prior data collection , participant five minute become acquainted wheelchair treadmill gradually bring set velocity 1.1 m/s ( 4.0 km/h ) use data collection . Previous research use speed 1.1m/s biomechanical test minimum speed require cross intersection United States . To ensure participant perform amount work test trial , power output standardize 0.15 W/kg incline 0.7 % incline 0.7 % produce result similar ground wheel speed 4-6 km/h . Resistance apply back wheelchair via pulley system ensure PO 0.15 W/kg . The oxygen cost wheelchair propulsion affect PO , therefore standardize PO allow u remove difference drag force result difference bodyweight wheelchair configuration . Standardizing PO also account variation participant ' weight pre-testing post-testing one-month post-testing . After participant comfortable wheeling treadmill , mouthpiece nose plug Parvo Medics ' TrueOne 2400 metabolic measurement system fit individual . Ten minute baseline ( rest state ) data collect ensure participant breathe normally ( i.e. , hyperventilate ) respiratory exchange ratio value appropriate ( le 0.9 ) . Participants begin wheel speed gradually increase 1.1 m/s , achieve speed reach ( approximately 15 ) five minute data collection begin . Kinetic spatial-temporal characteristic : Data SmartWheel collect 240 Hz use proprietary software filter use 4th order low-pass Butterworth filter cut-off frequency 20 Hz . Variables collect SmartWheel™ include three dimensional force , total force ( √ ( Fx2+Fy2+Fz2 ) ) , tangential force ( force act forward propulsion ) , cadence ( cycles/s ) , push angle , velocity . Wheeling pattern Two Optotrak 3020 ( NDI , Waterloo , ON ) position sensor use record sagittal-plane 2D kinematic data position 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint . The marker place 3rd metacarpophalangeal joint use define wheel strategy subject . Kinematic data collect sampling frequency 200 Hz . All data filter use fourth order , 7 Hz low-pass Butterworth filter . Data analysis : Kinetic kinematic wheeling data synchronize external trigger pulse , divide cycle base initiation force apply push rim , normalized time 100 % cycle . Data wheeling cycle occur within final 5th minute average participant . Hand trajectory profile wheel cycle occur within final 5th minute use categorize wheel pattern one four category . Two investigator , blind participant group allocation independently categorize wheel strategy accord definition . Wheeling strategy compare two investigator ensure consistency . Motor learning-based training intervention : Motor learning-based training administer 1 trainer . She 6 year experience study wheelchair propulsion experience provide ML-based training relate manual power wheelchair skill . Three trained volunteer assist pre post-testing well one-month retention test rotate schedule . Volunteers undergo 3 hour train test protocol . Participants ask participate 6 x 20 minute one-on-one training session 3 week period ( 2 sessions/ week ) . Six session select improvement biomechanical variable observe little 12 minute training , however improvement movement efficiency continuous skill observe within 6 session . The motor learning-based training focus core concept field motor learn . The motor learn concept include variable practice respect speed , feedback ( intrinsic extrinsic focus extrinsic ) , feedback focus three main variable ( wheel pattern , speed hand contact push rim , push angle ) , sequential learning ( specifically relate wheel pattern ) , mental imagery ( rest break ) . Practice intervention : The practice intervention administer 1 trainer . She 6 year manual wheelchair propulsion research experience . Participants ask participate 6 x 20 minute one-on-one training session 3 week period ( 2 sessions/ week ) . Six session select improvement biomechanical variable observe little 12 minute training , however improvement movement efficiency continuous skill observe within 6 session . Although general practice offer experience exposure repetition obtain practice consider element motor learning , important determine add benefit one-on-one training emphasis motor learn principle individual could perform .
