	<detailed_description>Protocol Investigation Deep Venous Thromboses Elective Cosmetic Surgery Patients use Doppler Ultrasound Background/Purpose Venous thromboembolism well-known serious risk surgery . In attempt reduce frequency postoperative complication , many plastic surgeon today elect anticoagulate patient deem high risk.1 The efficacy ethic treatment challenged.2 Moreover , prophylactic anticoagulation pose additional serious risk , include increase bleeding wound hematomas.2 It make sense use screen device detect symptomatic case also subclinical deep venous thrombosis treatment promptly initiate patient without evidence blood clot spar needless side effect anticoagulation . Doppler ultrasound image represent sensitive , direct , noninvasive method screen presence venous thromboses.3 This prospective study undertaken determine feasibility set outpatient plastic surgery . Doppler ultrasound image screen tool elective plastic surgery patient previously publish . This test add perioperative protocol , otherwise unchanged . Subjects Two hundred consecutive consenting adult men woman undergo outpatient elective plastic surgery total intravenous anesthesia investigate use Doppler ultrasound scan preoperatively , first day surgery , approximately 1 week surgery . Common operation include liposuction , abdominoplasty , facelift , cosmetic breast surgery . In addition , 25 control patient ( i.e. , men woman surgery ) investigate interval . Scans The Terason t3200 Ultrasound System Vascular series image deep vein low extremity . The vein evaluate image technique consist common femoral , great saphenous , superficial femoral , popliteal , posterior tibial vein . Both color Doppler flow 2-dimensional compression test ( Duplex scan ) perform . The thickness adipose layer also measure patient weight record check possible correlation . Clinical measure reduce risk venous thrombosis include : ( 1 ) spontaneous breathe without muscle relaxant , ( 2 ) prone position surgery , ( 4 ) sequential compression device , ( 4 ) movement low extremity surgery , ( 5 ) outpatient treatment early ambulation.2 Patients caution deep venous thrombosis ( blood clot ) know risk surgery report asymmetrical swell low extremity , thigh pain , fever surgeon immediately . Any patient positive scan refer local hospital confirmation treatment . Null Hypothesis Ultrasound scan safe , noninvasive , effective method detect blood clot deep vein low extremity plastic surgical patient . Informed Consent Patients informed nature study tell participation entirely voluntary free decline , way prejudice treatment . Patient Risk There patient risk . The study affect patient treatment . It offer possibility detection sub-clinical deep venous thrombosis . Sample Size A sample 1000 treat patient 25 control anticipate . Disclosure The author financial interest product , device , drug mention article . The author conflict interest disclose . There outside funding study .</detailed_description>
