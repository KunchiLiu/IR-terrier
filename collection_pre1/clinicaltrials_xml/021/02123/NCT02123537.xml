	<brief_summary>People multiple sclerosis ( MS ) often suffer foot drop , impairs walking ability . Foot drop inability lift foot swing phase walking . The purpose study find electrical stimulation leg , use Bioness L300 Foot Drop System , use treat foot drop people MS . It expect use system reduce foot drop , therefore improve walk ability , particularly area speed , strength , balance fall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Foot Drop People With Multiple Sclerosis Using Electrical Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due damage central nervous system , people multiple sclerosis ( MS ) often develop abnormal gait . One common problem inability lift foot swing phase ; call foot drop , cause loss ankle dorsiflexor strength spasticity ankle plantarflexors . Foot drop lead imbalance increase risk fall , due foot drag ground . Treating foot drop result improve gait , faster walk speed , improve balance reduce risk fall . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) stimulate either superficial deep branch common peroneal nerve . This stimulation lead contraction ankle dorsiflexors evertors , cause dorsiflexion eversion foot , result step motion lifting toe toward shin . This reduce foot drop , allow user regain natural stepping pattern ; also reduce spasticity , strengthen muscle increase joint range motion . The Bioness L300 Foot Drop System consist three component : leg cuff worn knee , provide electrical stimulation common peroneal nerve ; gait sensor attach shoe , detect stage gait cycle foot ; control unit , use adjust level stimulation receive . These three component communicate wirelessly , electrical stimulation apply appropriate time gait cycle . The study physician set system optimize stimulation accord participant 's gait need , participant use system 12 week . There initial four week adaptation period use system . During first four week participant gradually increase use system use day , allow muscle adjust electrical stimulation help prevent fatigue . During remain eight week participant instruct use system day , walk home community . Participants walk speed heart rate measure 10-metre straight line walk test 4-minute figure-8 walk test baseline , week 4 , 8 12 . Participants perform test time point without L300 Foot Drop System . Participant satisfaction assess end 12-week trial .</detailed_description>
