	<brief_summary>The cone beam image part radiotherapy treatment machine use low energy xrays head radiotherapy machine move around patient circle . This take picture give 3-dimensional information , somewhat like CT scan . These image better show position tumour surround soft tissue standard xrays previously use . Cone Beam Imaging Technology new use regularly The Christie many year . The standard cone beam scan take actual radiotherapy treatment treatment deliver . Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy ( VMAT Arc Radiotherapy ) novel method deliver radiotherapy involve continuous movement radiotherapy treatment machine head around patient MLC radiation . Arc radiotherapy clinically implement The Christie prostate radiotherapy treatment work progress implementation lung radiotherapy . The continuous gantry rotation inherent VMAT delivery make simultaneous image possible , although concern associate impact may patient dose image quality . The aim research ass whether image quality cone beam scan take treatment good standard cone beam scan take treatment use determine accuracy patient position tumour coverage radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
