	<brief_title>Intermittent Continuous Acetylsalicylic Acid Gene Expression Nasal Tissue Current Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze impact 12-week intervention intermittent continuous acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) smoking-related gene expression signature nasal epithelium current smoker analyze difference intermittent continuous ASA intervention . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether change smoking-related gene expression signature nasal epithelium persist one week agent intervention . II . To compare change urinary prostaglandin E metabolite ( PGE-M ) leukotriene E ( 4 ) ( LTE [ 4 ] ) continuous intermittent dosing arm determine whether change persist one week agent intervention . III . To analyze impact intermittent continuous ASA three lung cancer-related gene signature ( 80-gene signature , phosphoinositide 3-kinase [ PI3K ] gene signature , nasal epithelium cancer signature ) nasal epithelium analyze difference intermittent continuous ASA intervention . IV . To determine whether change , , lung cancer-related gene expression signature nasal epithelium persists one week agent intervention . V. To compare safety current smoker 12 week exposure continuous versus intermittent ASA . VI . To evaluate gender effect modulatory effect intermittent continuous ASA smoking-related gene expression signature . VII . To explore discovery-driven fashion effect ASA intervention whole-genome gene expression . VIII . To analyze impact intermittent continuous ASA karyometric analysis buccal cell analyze difference intermittent continuous ASA intervention . OUTLINE : Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( CONTINUOUS ) : Participants receive aspirin orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 week . ARM II ( INTERMITTENT ) : Participants receive placebo PO QD week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 aspirin PO QD week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 . After completion study treatment , participant follow 2 week .</detailed_description>
