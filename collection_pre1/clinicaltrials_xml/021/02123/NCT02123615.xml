	<brief_summary>ASIS Corporation ( ASIS ) develop automatic injection system delivery injectable product 's optimum/right spot , outside fascia , exist subdermally ( skin muscle ) . Bloodless basically imply longer lasting medicinal effect , minimal side effect - advantage reflect NIH mission enhance health , lengthen life , reduce burden illness disability . ASIS device stabilize surface skin negative pressure emit electrical current create bloodless cavity subdermally . ASIS device correctly , automatically , consistently deliver therapeutic agent , yet require little skill practitioner - provide steady safe infusion subdermal bloodless space virtually injectable product addition Botox , include GAMMAGARD LIQUID , Enbrel , Insulin , Fillers , etc . According FDA , `` This innovation major impact healthcare industry . ''</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 would require 6 month , demonstrate ASIS device 's consistent performance 60 subject Primary Immunodeficiency ( PI ) , particular skin affect disease . 30 subject receive Gadolinium subcutaneously , 30 subject receive Gadolinium subdermally ASIS device . An MRI take promptly Gadolinium injection , start reference , subsequent MRI take 6 hr , 12 hr , 24 hr later compare Persistent % . Since n't way measure level Gadolinium within , ( e.g . GAMMAGARD ) matter , least Prolongation Gadolinium may approximate great longer Persistent % MRI . However , approximation work variable minimize population Primary Immunodeficiency ( PI ) , particular skin affect . Case point , Primary Immunodeficiency ( PI ) patient prone infection , tend scared skin less vascularity , expectantly prolong Gadolinium subcutaneously Persistent % , different skin normal patient , Gadolinium subdermally Persistent % may may change . Therefore , Relative Prolongation Ability Score total Persistent % subdermally total Persistent % subcutaneously , different specific particular skin affect Primary Immunodeficiency . However , valuable indicator help u modify GAMMAGARD dosage duration inject `` unknown '' subdermal space Aim 2 . Aim 2 would require 12 month , use GAMMAGARD , instead Gadolinium , demonstrate advantage ASIS device subdermally subcutaneously , Primary Immunodeficiency subject . Of course Relative Prolongation Ability Score Aim1 valuable , n't absolutely required start Aim 2 , GAMMAGARD 's Pharmacokinetics study anyway , follow Peak Trough level immunoglobulin G. However , Pharmacokinetics subdermally inject GAMMAGARD dependent GAMMAGARD 's diffusion subdermal bloodless space ; therefore , GAMMAGARD get bloodstream become severely inhibited , change osmolality GAMMAGARD end . The therapeutic advantage GAMMAGARD ASIS device subdermally subcutaneously also study compare reduction Validated Acute Serious Bacterial Infections , adverse reaction , injection site pain .</detailed_description>
