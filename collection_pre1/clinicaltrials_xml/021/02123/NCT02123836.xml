	<brief_summary>A novel method develop expand natural ( NK ) cell enhance cytotoxicity cancer cell maintain low kill capacity non-transformed cell . In method , donor NK cell expand co-culture irradiated K562 cell line modify express membrane bound IL-15 41BB ligand ( K562-mb15-41BBL ) . Expression proteins conjunction unknown stimulus provide K562 cell promote selective growth NK cell . Then , expand NK cell population deplete T cell prevent graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . Expanded activated NK cell show powerful anti-leukemic activity acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell vitro animal model leukemia.Unpublished laboratory result also demonstrate T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( T-ALL ) extremely sensitive cytotoxicity exert expand activated NK cell . The present study represent translation laboratory finding clinical application . The study propose determine feasibility , safety efficacy infuse expand NK cell patient AML T-lineage ALL resistant standard therapy demonstrate persistent minimal residual disease ( MRD ) . Patients myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , high risk develop AML also eligible study . In patient cohort , study also investigate vivo lifespan phenotype expand NK cell . The main hypothesis test study infusion expand activated NK cell produce measurable clinical response patient AML T-ALL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study enroll 20 eligible subject receive NK cell infusion test whether infusion expand activated NK cell produce measurable clinical response patient AML/MDS T-ALL.The study aim infuse target dose 10 x 107 CD56+ cells/kg , however , actual cell dose obtain vary depend donor harvest , accept range cell infusion 0.5-20 x 107 CD56+ cells/kg . On day -10 , eligible donor ( adult family member recipient ) undergo apheresis . A second apheresis procedure may need obtain required cell count donor . NK cell expand co-culture irradiate ( 100 Gy ) K562-mb15-41BBL cell close culture container 10 day . Prior NK cell infusion Day 0 , recipient undergo screen evaluation receive cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine , IL-2 , supportive medication ( e.g . mesna ) . Cytokine regimen IL-2 initiate even day -1 ( dose 1 6 ) . IL-2 continue dose 1 million units/m2 subcutaneously 3 time per week 2 week ( 6 dos total ) . Post-infusion follow-up procedure 1 year day NK cell infusion include physical examination , Complete Blood Count , metabolic/chemistry study . The effect NK cell infusion also determine compare MRD level treatment . MRD blood bone marrow level collect baseline specify time point ( 1 year day NK cell infusion ) . NK cell donor recruit family member patient recipient . Potential donor age 21 year old consent undergo require screening test human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) typing . Since 20 eligible subject enrol NK cell recipient , 20 donor also recruit study . Ineligible NK cell donor replace .</detailed_description>
