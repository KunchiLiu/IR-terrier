	<brief_title>A Study JNJ-56021927 ( ARN-509 ) Abiraterone Acetate Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label ( participant know identity study drug receive ) study participant Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) . The study single sequence design ( ie , participant take abiraterone acetate + prednisone [ AAP ] daily Days 1-7 Treatment Cycle 1 proceed combine daily intake AAP+JNJ-56021927 Treatment Cycle 1 , Day 8 end treatment [ ie , expect duration approximately 18 month ] conduct two cohort ( group participant 's ) . The study consist 28-day screening phase determine eligibility , open-label treatment phase consist 28-day treatment cycle , 30-day follow-up phase collection adverse event ( AE ) last dose study drug . Participants blood sample collect study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety , antitumor activity ( PSA ) . Participant safety also monitor collection adverse event . Imaging assessment disease evaluation plan discretion Investigator . Once participant complete study treatment Cycle 3 Day 1 , data cutoff plan evaluate short term safety profile combination complete PK analysis cutoff date . All participant continue study ( ie , receive treatment ) disease progression , withdrawal consent , lose follow-up , occurrence unacceptable toxicity . The end study define participant complete treatment . Participant 's safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
