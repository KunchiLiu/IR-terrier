	<brief_summary>Syncope affect 50 % Canadians , cause 1-2 % emergency room visit , probably responsible CDN $ 250 million health care spending year . It associate decreased quality life , trauma , loss employment , limitation daily activity . The common cause vasovagal syncope . This occur people age , lifelong predilection . While median number faint population 2 , come investigator care median 10-15 lifetime spell , increase frequency year presentation . Vasovagal syncope due abrupt hypotension transient bradycardia , cause cerebral hypoperfusion . The pathophysiology may either failure venous return progressive vasodilation , due inappropriately low sympathetic outflow . Sympathetic stimulation might involve early reflex cascade . There known medical treatment frequent fainting . The investigator perform pivotal CIHR-funded randomize trial show neither permanent pacing , beta blocker , fludrocortisone help majority patient . However 3 observational study suggest beta blocker prevent syncope old subject , Prevention Syncope Trial ( POST1 ) show prespecified , -stratified analysis patient ≥42 year tend benefit . The investigator recent meta-analysis show benefit metoprolol patient , hazard ratio 0.52 ( CI 0.27 1.01 ) , age-specific response beta blocker ( p = 0.007 ) . These result suggest need randomize clinical trial metoprolol prevention vasovagal syncope old subject . Accordingly , investigator conduct poll 48 cardiologist neurologist Canada abroad : 98 % state randomized trial necessary , 92 % agree participate trial . Separately , study emerge first choice syncope randomize trial consultation Canadian international expert . Objective : To determine treatment metoprolol patient ≥40 year old moderate severely frequent vasovagal syncope well suppress syncope recurrences placebo . Methods : This longitudinal , prospective , parallel design , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial . Patients enrol recruitment period 4 year follow fixed period 1 year . Subjects ≥1 faint previous year , diagnosis vasovagal syncope base quantitative diagnostic score . They randomize receive either metoprolol placebo initial dose 50 mg bid . Dose adjustment make accord treat physician discretion optimize tolerance compliance maximize dose . The primary outcome measure time first recurrence syncope ( 2 week dose titration wash-in period ) 1-year observation period . The primary analysis perform intention-to-treat basis . Secondary analysis include on-treatment analysis , well analyse compare syncope presyncope frequency , number need treat , quality life , impact syncope daily living , cost perspective publicly fund health care system . The investigator enroll 248 patient 85 % power detect reduction ( p &lt; 0.05 ) primary outcome 50 % ( placebo group ) 30 % ( midodrine group ) , 40 % relative risk reduction . This sample size also allow 11 % rate subject dropout loss follow-up syncopal event . The University Calgary Syncope Clinic well-functioning clinical trial apparatus successfully complete randomize , multicenter Prevention Syncope Trials ( POST1 : metoprolol vasovagal syncope ; POST2 : fludrocortisone vasovagal syncope ) SIRCAT ( Statin-Induced Reduction Cardiomyopathy Trial ) . Enrolment underway CIHR-funded POST3 ( pace versus loop recorder syncope patient bifascicular block ) POST4 ( midodrine vasovagal syncope ) . Study centre highly productive POST1-4 agree participate . The investigator therefore ample syncope enrol centre . Relevance : This study provide evidence inform use metoprolol treatment moderate severely frequent syncope old patient vasovagal syncope . Given lack conventional medical therapy investigator expect rapid impact care .</brief_summary>
