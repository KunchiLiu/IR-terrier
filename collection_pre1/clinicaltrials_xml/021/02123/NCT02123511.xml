	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study whether acetylcysteine oral rinse lessen saliva thickness painful mouth sores patient head neck cancer undergo radiation therapy . Side effect radiation therapy head neck , thicken saliva mouth sore , may interfere activity daily live eat drinking , may also cause treatment stop delay . Acetylcysteine rinse may reduce saliva thickness mouth sore , improve quality life patient head neck cancer undergo radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acetylcysteine Rinse Reducing Saliva Thickness Mucositis Patients With Head Neck Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effectiveness N-acetylcysteine ( acetylcysteine ) improve saliva viscosity ( measure Groningen Radiotherapy-Induced Xerostomia [ GRIX ] ) patient undergo chemotherapy radiotherapy head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) improve GRIX subscale patient undergo chemotherapy radiotherapy head neck cancer . II . To determine whether NAC improve patient report quality life measure European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) -Quality Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) Head &amp; Neck ( H &amp; N ) 35 . III . To assess adverse event profile NAC measure Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) every week radiation . IV . To determine patient adherence N-acetylcysteine mucoadherent rinse use patient report survey . V. To determine long-term benefit N-acetylcysteine measure GRIX questionnaire 45 day 90 day post treatment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive acetylcysteine oral rinse gargle swish 60 second spit 5 time per day , begin within 3 day initiation radiotherapy 14 day follow completion radiotherapy . ARM II : Patients receive placebo oral rinse gargle swish 60 second spit 5 time per day begin within 3 day initiation radiotherapy 14 day follow completion radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 45 90 day .</detailed_description>
