	<brief_title>An Open Label Phase II Trial Topical Sirolimus Treatment Refractory Oral Chronic Graft-versus-Host-Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Topical steroid therapy effective manage oral cGVHD symptom . However , certain proportion participant experience adequate response topical steroid continue degree discomfort . Sirolimus non-steroidal immunosuppressive medication demonstrate efficacy management cGVHD . Based , believe topical formulation apply inside mouth may also demonstrate efficacy localized basis . The purpose study assess safety efficacy topical sirolimus swish spit solution treatment oral cGVHD participant adequate clinical response topical steroid therapy alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>While restriction concurrent systemic medication , subject must stable immunomodulatory medication regimen 7 day prior begin study without plan adjust dos follow fourweek study period . Dose modification maintain therapeutic drug level immunosuppressant ( i.e . tacrolimus sirolimus ) study intervention period allow constitute trial violation . Changes medication noncGVHD medical condition affect eligibility . Age 4 year old . Patients symptomatic oral chronic graftversushost disease ( sensitivity score ≥ 4 ) . Stable topical steroid therapy dexamethasone , clobetasol , budesonide oral solution ( 5 min , four time day ) seven day prior study enrollment . Stable systemic cGVHD medication regimen seven day prior study enrollment . Dose modification maintain therapeutic drug level immunosuppressant ( i.e . tacrolimus sirolimus ) month prior study intervention period allow constitute trial violation . The effect sirolimus develop human fetus unknown . For reason immunosuppressant agent well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion topical sirolimus administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients already use topical sirolimus therapy . Patients allergy/intolerance sirolimus . Sensitivity score ≤ 3 . Inability comply study instruction . Pregnant breastfeeding . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude due potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant , breastfeed discontinue mother treated sirolimus . HIVpositive participant combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction sirolimus . In addition , participant increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
