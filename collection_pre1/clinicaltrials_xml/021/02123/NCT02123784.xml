	<brief_title>Biomarkers Surgical Treatment Rotator Cuff Tears</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotator cuff tear ( i.e . structural failure tissue disruption least one four muscle tendon form rotator cuff ) extremely common injury represent common muscle-tendon tear patient . Repair rotator cuff tear usually advocate painful tear functional impairment . However , high failure rate 13-68 % report surgical repair rotator cuff tear , irrespective surgical technique employ . Higher rate re-rupture associate large tear , increase patient age , increase fatty degeneration cuff muscle . There general consensus cause re-rupture ; mechanical factor , exist technique suture , biological factor consider main factor recurrence .</detailed_description>
