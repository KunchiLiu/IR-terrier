	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate number circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) treatment use experimental method detect CTC , compare commercial CTC assay result , patient prostate , breast colorectal cancer . Experiments do develop new assay technique also test CTC react commonly use drug . This information analyze determine experimental assay helpful future predict patient 's cancer may react certain treatment . The research experiment also attempt grow CTC long-term `` immortal '' cell line study protein gene mutation relate specific tumor ( familial ) , test sensitivity drug . Blood sample collect specific time point routine medical care patient prostate , breast , colorectal solid tumor cancer . Samples also collect patient cancer comparison purpose . Samples experimental test identify code result share participant . Patients prostate , breast colorectal cancer also blood sample draw commercial CTC assay part standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common cancer men , exception non-melanomatous skin cancer , second lead cause cancer death among men . According Center Disease Control United States Cancer Statistics ( USCS ) , year 2007 29,093 death cause prostate cancer , 223,307 men newly diagnose disease United States Given clinical heterogeneity disease well toxicities current therapy , new prognostic predictive biomarkers much need facilitate inform therapeutic decision making . A strong correlation CTC progression breast , colon prostate cancer demonstrate , prognostic predictive response therapy overall survival . The use Veridex CellSearch™ CTC assay approve FDA monitor breast colon cancer therapy . CTCs standard care monitor response prostate cancer treatment , well . It likely change number CTCs may also predictive indicator treatment response . Techniques utilized Veridex Cellsearch™ severely damage CTC process , remove possibility study characterization CTC . This study attempt improve upon technology develop test novel strategy isolation intact viable CTCs , compare result CellSearch™ benchmark . CTC Development short long-term cell line sample would greatly facilitate characterization metastasis-producing cell individual patient . For example , may allow identification somatic gene mutation ( e.g . AR ) predict drug therapy response , global gene protein expression pattern , drug sensitivity resistance test . Following informed consent , patient two 7.5 cc sample blood drawn time routine blood work related disease monitoring treatment drawn . In addition , patient diagnosis breast cancer , prostate cancer , colorectal cancer additional 10cc drawn CellSave tube standard care CellSearch™ CTC enumeration insurance cover cost . Additional sample obtain select patient follow treatment monitor disease progression treatment response . Samples de-identified sent Dr. Goodman 's laboratory Roseman University Health Sciences . Samples process result enter password-protected database . Results experiment research sample share patient . Results CellSearch™ CTC assay de-identified honest broker enter database . Patient information also collect , de-identified enter database . Information include age , gender , tumor status ( TNM ) , serum LDH , pertinent standard care tumor marker ( PSA , CEA , CA 27-29 , available ) , date tumor diagnosis , treatment history , date regional metastatic progression date death ( applicable ) .</detailed_description>
