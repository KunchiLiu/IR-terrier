	<brief_title>Antidepressant Effect rTMS add-on ECT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ECT well-established effective method treatment severe depression . During last decade , rTMS appear potential new non-invasive antidepressant method , may potential alternative ECT due few side effect . Both method expose brain electric current . But ECT associate global cerebral stimulation elicit epileptic seizure , rTMS implies non-convulsive focal stimulation time vary magnetic field . Thus , antidepressant effect rTMS depend seizure activity consequently require anesthesia . In addition , rTMS seem associate cognitive disturbance . Previous research indicate antidepressant effect rTMS associate specific stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . The majority clinically control study use high frequency stimulation leave frontal cortex ( 1-4 ) . Few use right prefrontal low frequency rTMS , less side effect , local discomfort low risk release epileptic seizure , high frequency stimulation ( 5-10 ) . Both model use vary result . Meta-analysis antidepressant effect rTMS ( 11 , x ) find modest , statistically significant antidepressant effect generally definite conclusion antidepressant effect rTMS difficult draw , probably small select study population , vary way stimulation confound factor clinical setting . The important clinical question whether rTMS may substitute ECT treatment depression almost exclusively elucidated study use high frequency stimulation leave frontal cortex . Some suggest effectiveness rTMS equal ECT non-delusional patient ( 12-19 ) . However , recent investigation compare antidepressant efficacy side effect right prefrontal low frequency rTMS ECT . In study mean Hamilton total 17-item ( HAM-D score ) score reduce significantly time group ( ECT : p &lt; 0.001 , rTMS : p &lt; 0.001 ) ; ECT effective rTMS short term 3 week treatment . The outcome point right frontal low frequency rTMS first line substitute ECT , might place treatment depression add type treatment . ECT normally administer 3 time week 3-4 week . Daily treatment session might accelerate remission , impossible cognitive side effect . However , rTMS seem associate reduction cognitive performance might potentiate antidepressant efficacy ECT . Therefore investigator find clinical interesting investigate degree low frequency right prefrontal rTMS use ad add-on may potentiate antidepressant effect unilateral ECT accelerate remission . In addition want investigate te correlation change depressive symptom -blood concentration specific inflammation CNS- maker</detailed_description>
