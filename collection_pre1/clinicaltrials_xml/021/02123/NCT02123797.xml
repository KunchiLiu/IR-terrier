	<brief_summary>Lung cancer kill 160,000 patient annually ; represent 28 % US cancer death . The overall year survival rate improve 12 % 17 % 33 year . This failure reflect innate lethality lung cancer , also reflect defect patient care delivery . Care lung cancer patient start abnormal radiologic scan , proceeds diagnostic biopsy , test determine extent spread disease ( stage ) , selection appropriate treatment , finally end patient outcome . At step multiple option independent specialist , one engage process sequential referral serial care model . This process often user-friendly , riddle inefficiency , delay , outcome variance . The coordinated multidisciplinary model , patient doctor collaborate provide evidence-based care , believe expert superior , examples successful implementation . The implementation gap exist paucity good quality data , lack implementation know-how . Embedded high US lung cancer mortality zone , great Memphis area racially , culturally , economically geographically diverse population . The investigator research group show poor quality care impairs patient survival region great US . The investigator link patient survival compliance multidisciplinary care plan . In project , investigator propose rigorously test impact multidisciplinary care model patient outcomes community-based , private practice environment , similar 70 % lung cancer care deliver US . The objective study provide high-level evidence impact multidisciplinary care lung cancer patient outcome . Multidisciplinary care define model care patient , care-givers key specialist concurrently directly evaluate patient presence patient informal caregiver , order develop evidence-based consensus care plan</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Building Multidisciplinary Bridge Across Quality Chasm Thoracic Oncology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within Baptist Memorial Health Care system , Multidisciplinary Thoracic Oncology Program two component : Primarily , program center multidisciplinary clinic , wherein patient informal caregiver see multiple specialist single appointment time ; secondarily , program include multidisciplinary conference , wherein specialist potentially involved lung cancer care discuss patient referred presentation make consensus recommendation care . This study focus primarily experience outcome care deliver patient evaluate multidisciplinary clinic . However , data conference also include aspect study . The goal improve access quality thoracic oncologic care delivery within Baptist Healthcare System The investigator specific aim perform prospective , match cohort comparative effectiveness study patient receive serial vs. multidisciplinary care , key patient-centered endpoint ( survival , stakeholder satisfaction care experience , timeliness stage-appropriateness care , quality staging ) . Serial care define current system linear , sequential , referral-based care delivery .</detailed_description>
