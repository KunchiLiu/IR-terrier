	<brief_summary>Non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery prove adequate alternative management many lung condition pneumothorax , lung volume reduction , pulmonary metastasectomy , removal lung nodule , segmentectomy lobectomy . However , hemodynamic change one lung ventilation fully investigate . The goal study compare change hemodynamics ( include blood pressure , heart rate , cardiac output , pulse pressure variation , fluid responsiveness ) one lung ventilation conventional intubated non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic ( VATS ) operation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Changes During One Lung Ventilation Non-intubated Vedio-assisted Thoracoscopic Operations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-intubated vedio-assisted thoracoscopic ( VATS ) prove safely perform well traditional intubated VATS . However , difference hemodynamic change fluid responsiveness one lung ventilation ( OLV ) two group rarely report . For complete lung collapse , spontaneous negative pressure respiration must well maintain non-intubated VATS . In comparison , positive pressure ventilation dependent lung apply OLV intubate VATS . This study plan compare change hemodynamics ( include blood pressure , heart rate , cardiac output ) OLV group . As functional hemodynamic monitoring ( FloTrac system ) mostly utilized positive pressure ventilation , applicability FloTrac non- intubate VATS also testify . In study , also measure fluid responsiveness FloTrac system rapid infusion ( within 10 minute ) 10 mL/kg crystalloid fluid . We plan compare change cardiac output fluid responsiveness OLV two group .</detailed_description>
