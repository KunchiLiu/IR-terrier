	<brief_summary>Essential tremor common adult-onset movement disorder , essential voice tremor vocal manifestation essential tremor . While nearly essential tremor patient experience hand tremor , many also manifest head tremor voice tremor . Essential voice tremor lead increase vocal effort , decreased intelligibility , misconstrue emotional state . Only one medication , propranolol , FDA-approved treat essential tremor . Propranolol felt nearly effective axial tremor ( head , trunk , neck ) extremity tremor . However , study objective assessment prospective way EVT . For patient essential voice tremor , limited publish data suggests botulinum toxin show lead functional voice improvement . Botulinum toxin , though also well-studied objective voice outcome , commonly use clinical therapy treatment essential voice tremor . While use often essential voice tremor propranolol therapy , botulinum toxin also prospectively study validate , objective voice outcome measure . The investigator would like determine propranolol significant effect vocal tremor . The investigator would also like determine , objective way , effect botulinum toxin vocal tremor . If effective , propranolol would provide affordable non-invasive alternative addition botulinum toxin injection patient essential voice tremor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims • Determine effect propranolol vocal tremor treatment-seeking population . To date , nonselective beta-blocker propranolol remain agent approve treatment essential tremor ( ET ) . For ET , immediate sustain release formation propranolol equally effective , beta-blockers like nadolol timolol effective . While propranolol improves tremor great half patient essential tremor , effect tremor evenly distribute . Improvement tremor symptom great limb tremor axial tremor , therefore propranolol commonly use treatment essential voice tremor ( EVT ) . However , effect essential voice tremor never objectively , prospectively study . Our aim objectively determine effect propranolol essential voice tremor treatment-seeking population evaluate patient EVT propranolol therapy . • Determine effect botulinum toxin injection vocal tremor treatment-seeking population . More recently , botulinum toxin A use treatment EVT . Chemical denervation botulinum toxin modestly effective reduce limb tremor ET complicate side effect weakness . However , botulinum toxin seem effective treat EVT manifestation ET . While prior study enlist validated assessment voice quality measure effect botulinum toxin injection EVT , show subjective improvement acoustic measure tremor rating videotape speech therapy botulinum toxin . Our aim objectively determine effect botulinum toxin vocal tremor treatment-seeking population evaluate patient EVT botulinum therapy . Voice Evaluations Medications For first evaluation , research coordinator collect demographic patient report data . This data result provide patient questionnaire record patient 's voice . VRQOL data collect patient answer ten statement 1-5 scale , `` I trouble speak loudly hear noisy situation '' `` I run air need take frequent breath . '' QUEST data also record 30-item essential tremor-specific questionnaire . Patient also complete global voice rating 0-7 score `` How would rate voice today ? '' After subjective questionnaire , patient participate vocal record use prompt passage validate CAPE-V voice assessment tool . After discussion risk benefit propranolol therapy , patient give prescription principal investigator propranolol . The second evaluation occur office visit two week initiate propranolol therapy . Again , consist patient-reported V-RQOL , QUEST , global voice rating data . Patient participate second vocal record use prompt passage validate CAPE-V voice assessment tool . At second evaluation , patient receive botulinum toxin injection . The risk benefit botulinum toxin therapy explain patient , bilateral injection take place . Four week botulinum toxin injection , patient undergo third voice assessment . Again , consist patient-reported V-RQOL , QUEST , global voice rating data . Patient participate third vocal record use prompt passage validate CAPE-V voice assessment tool .</detailed_description>
