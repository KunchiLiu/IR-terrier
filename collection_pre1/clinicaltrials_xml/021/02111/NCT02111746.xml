	<detailed_description>Study Design : This prospective , single-institution , parallel-group , single-blinded , randomized-controlled , two-arm , effectiveness study compare bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension ( Exparel® ) versus regular bupivacaine hydrochloride ( HCl ) . Procedure : In patient age 18 require sternotomy , thoracotomy , mini-thoracotomy , laparotomy incision screen consented potential enrollment . Patients randomize follow consent either Exparel® regular bupivacaine hydrochloride group . Course Study : The study accrue patient course 4 year . Enrollment : Enrollment consist adult patient age 18 undergoing surgical procedure require sternotomy , thoracotomy , mini-thoracotomy , laparotomy incision . Patients screen consent preoperatively . If patient deem eligible consent participate , randomization occur patient consider enrol . Recruitment : The target enrollment 280 patient . Risks : There small increase risk patient participate study addition possible chance breach patient confidentiality study involve evaluation FDA-approved drug . As detailed informed consent , subject risk develop adverse effect Exparel® , describe drug packet insert HCl Bupivacaine , also describe drug packet insert . The investigator expect additional physical risk unintentional disclosure sensitive patient health information . Data Safety Monitoring : As Principal Investigator study , Dr. Charlton-Ouw Department Cardiothoracic Vascular Surgery The University Texas Houston Medical School conduct data safety monitoring study . He annually meet co-investigators review patient enrol study . As part data safety monitoring plan , patient enrol point time would unblinded order review outcome . Additionally , view uncertainty attach treatment effect heterogeneous population , owe limit currently available data , independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee , oversee progress trial . IND # : The drug use already approve FDA IND/IDE # Proposed Funding Source : The study internally fund investigator-initiated . Communication Study Results : The communication study result occur authorized individual list take part study department . The individual take part study acknowledge adhere importance patient safety protection private information . The result study analyzed publish approval principal investigator , co-investigators , biostatistician peer-reviewed scientific journal and/or present international/national scientific conference meeting regardless outcome .</detailed_description>
