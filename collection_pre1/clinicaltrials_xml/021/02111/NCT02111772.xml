	<brief_summary>In patient asthma , reaction allergens environment ( mold , pollen , weed , domestic pet , dust allergen ) play important role cause asthma symptom . However , upper respiratory tract infection , typically caused common cold virus , rhinovirus , also cause asthma get worse . In previous study University Virginia , find mild asthmatic , high level allergy antibody ( call IgE ) blood , develop persistent cold chest symptom give infection rhinovirus ( frequent cause common cold ) . The cold symptom produce rhinovirus tend peak first 4 -7 day cold . These symptom , include nasal congestion , similar experience previous cold . This study do learn common cold cause viral infection affect people asthma . The goal learn improve care asthma symptom cause common cold virus ( call rhinovirus ) . Most adults experience one two cold cause rhinovirus every year . In addition , 75-80 % asthma exacerbation cause viral infection cause virus , primarily child . Adults less likely experience significant change asthma symptom get cold , develop protective immune response previous cold help diminish symptom .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Criteria subject : Subjects must able understand provide write informed consent Age 18 &lt; 40 year age , gender , racial/ethnic origin . Participant must willing comply study procedures requirement . Participant must consider eligible participation base result screen procedure conduct protocol number IRB # 12656 University Virginia . Criteria asthmatic subject : Physiciandiagnosed asthma Mild asthma per adapt definition new NAEPP Guidelines Diagnosis Management Asthma . History intermittent use inhaled bronchodilator ( e.g . albuterol ) manage symptom Positive Methacholine challenge test ( i.e . least 20 % fall FEV1 Methacholine concentration ≤8 mg/ml ) . Total serum IgE level &gt; 600 IU/ml ) . Positive test allergen specific IgE antibody prick skin test dust mite , Alternaria , and/or ragweed subject challenge RV fall , positive test tree and/or grass allergen challenge RV spring . In keep study design goal inoculate subject period allergen exposure , sensitization allergen ( e.g. , cat dog ) also qualify enrollment subject currently expose allergens home . Criteria nonasthmatic subject ( control ) : • Subjects without history asthma allergic disorder ( e.g. , allergic rhinitis , allergic conjunctivitis , atopic dermatitis , food allergy ) . This include hypersensitivity drug insect venom represent distinct genetic subgroup . Exclusion criterion : Criteria subject : Inability unwillingness participant subject 's legal representative give write informed consent HIPPA authorization Positive test serum neutralize antibody RV16 ( strain rhinovirus use study ) . Subjects neutralize antibody titer &gt; 1:4 exclude . Chronic heart disease , lung disease asthma , chronic illness , include primary and/or secondary immunodeficiency . An upper low respiratory tract infection within six week prior enrollment Previous nasal sinus surgery within last 12 month . A history smoke Female subject , plan become pregnant study , nurse baby . Additionally , include study , woman childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test screening , runin , prior viral inoculation agree use effective method birth control , limited , birth control pill , contraceptive foam , diaphragm , IUD , abstinence , condom . Criteria asthmatic subject : An FEV1 &lt; 70 % predicted enrollment , baseline prior inoculation RV16 ( day 0 ) methacholine challenge test . However , accommodate subject low lung volume ( i.e. , FVC &lt; 88 % enrollment ) FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 80 % use exclusion criterion instead FEV1 &lt; 70 % predict value . Hospitalization treatment ER asthma last three year Intubation management intensive care unit asthma exacerbation Subjects use inhaled corticosteroid , inhale ipratropium bromide , inhale long act beta agonist , inhale cromolyn nedocromil systemic leukotriene modifier asthma daily basis within 4 week prior enrollment subject use nasal corticosteroid daily basis within 4 week prior enrollment . Subjects currently receive betaadrenergic block agent . Subjects currently receive allergen immunotherapy ( IT ) , receive allergen IT within last 2 year . Nonasthmatic subject ( control ) : Subjects positive methacholine test Subjects total IgE level &gt; 50 IU/ml and/or positive skin test screen IRB protocol # 12656 .</criteria>
