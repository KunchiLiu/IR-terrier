	<brief_title>Lumbar Manipulation Exercise Treatment Acute Low Back Pain Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double blind , randomize control , parallel group study . The investigator consider adolescent patient primary complaint low back pain refer physical therapy . The purpose study determine addition lumbar manipulation improve function , decrease pain , recurrence adolescent low back pain . The secondary aim study determine modification clinical prediction rule Flynn effective identifying adolescent patient low back pain would benefit lumbar manipulation . Prior randomization , patient complete several self-report measure receive standardized history physical examination perform treat physical therapist . The information collect include age , sex , duration nature symptom . Standardized physical examination measure include lumbar active range motion assessment quality mobility , lumbar segmental mobility , hip internal rotation range motion , straight leg raise test , prone instability test . Treating physical therapist train evaluation measure data collection begin . Patients assessed item modify clinical prediction rule consist 4 item ; duration symptom , symptom distal knee , Hip Internal Rotation &gt; 35 degree , presence lumbar segmental hypomobility . The fear avoidance belief questionnaire work sub-scale component remove since score would likely valid adolescent population . Meeting 3 4 item consider positive rule population . The manipulate therapist performs intervention aware treatment allocation , whereas treat physical therapist patient blind treatment group allocation . To assess patient successfully blind group allocation , investigator ask patient guess intervention perform follow discharge therapy . Randomization determine check randomly generate computer list tell manipulate therapist assign group . The computer list generate aide involve study blindly draw 52 card place equal number patient either manipulation sham group . To address issue safety , patient experience clinically significant decrease functional ability increase pain classified adverse reaction . The minimally clinical important difference Patient Specific Functional Scale &gt; = 6 . While minimal clinical important difference Numeric Pain Rating Scale 2 point . Following manipulation sham intervention patient ask experienced pain discomfort follow intervention . An interim analysis plan midpoint study assess safety efficacy intervention . If &gt; 1/3 patient manipulation group worsen symptom follow , study terminate safety reason .</detailed_description>
