	<brief_summary>Currently , spinal anesthesia commonly use cesarean section.But spinal anesthesia block visceral vagus nerve , patient prone nausea , vomit , chest tightness discomfort uterus stretch .For parturients poor uterine contraction bleed large , obstetrician often use oxytocin strengthen contraction uterine , also would increase parturients ' discomfort.Anesthesiologists often intravenous sedative hypnotic ( eg.propofol midazolam ) alleviate fear parturients baby delivered.One side effect propofol midazolam would lead respiratory depression.For poor respiratory reserve parturients , functional residual capacity ( FRC ) group could reduce 20 % , oxygen consumption also increased.The SPO2 could decline quickly intraoperatively.Dexmedetomidine ( DEX ) novel , highly selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist , selectivity α2 receptor 1600 time higher α1.It also could provide dose-dependent sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety inhibition sympathetic nerve effects.Because minimal impact respiratory , could safely effectively used sedate patient undergoing cesarean section.But change endocrine system hemodynamic parturients may affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics anesthetic drugs.Currently study demonstrate increased sensitivity anesthetic drug parturients , lidocaine isoflurane.The study aim explore optimal DEX dose produce suitable sedation parturients , compare norman nonpregnant woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Optimal Dose Dexmedetomidine Sedation Postpartum Parturients Nonpregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parturients undergo cesarean section normal nonpregnant woman undergo low abdominal surgery schedule . All patient accept spinal anesthesia first.And dose DEX would perform soon umbilical cord clap parturients non-pregnant woman group dose DEX would perform spinal anesthesia conduct . Determination median effective ( ED50 ) dose perform Dixon Mood up-and-down method . Initial dos 1.4μg/kg , dose adjustment interval 0.1μg/kg first three turn point 0.05μg/kg last four turn point . Each patient 's sedation state assess use modify observer 's assessment awareness /sedation ( OAA/S ) scale every 5 min start dexmedetomidine infusion 30 min . Adequate sedation define OAA/S≤3 assessment time point 30 min</detailed_description>
