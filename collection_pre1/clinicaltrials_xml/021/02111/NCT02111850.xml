	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy treat patient metastatic cancer involve take white blood cell patient , grow laboratory large number , genetically modify specific cell type virus ( retrovirus ) attack tumor cell , give cell back patient . This type therapy call gene transfer . In protocol , modify patient white blood cell retrovirus gene anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 incorporated retrovirus . Objective : The purpose study determine safe number cell infuse see particular tumor-fighting cell ( anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cell ) cause tumor shrink certain treatment safe . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 metastatic cancer express MAGE-A3 molecule . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Leukapheresis : If patient meet requirement study undergo leukapheresis obtain white blood cell make anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital approximately 4 week treatment . - Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>T Cell Receptor Immunotherapy Targeting MAGE-A3 Patients With Metastatic Cancer Who Are HLA-DP0401 Positive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - We construct single retroviral vector contain $ &lt; = chain T cell receptor ( TCR ) recognize DP0401/0402 restrict MAGE-A3 tumor antigen , use mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficiency . - In co-cultures HLA-DP0401/0402 MAGE-A3 double positive tumor , anti- MAGE-A3- DP0401/0402 restrict ( anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 ) TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN-y high specificity . Objectives : Primary objective : - Determine safe dose administration autologous CD4 cell transduce anti- MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 restrict ( MAGE-A3-DP4 ) TCR aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . - Determine approach result objective tumor regression patient metastatic cancer express MAGE-A3-DP4 . - Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA-DP0401/0402 positive 18 year age old must - Metastatic cancer whose tumor express MAGE-A3-DP4 antigen ; - Previously receive non-responder recur follow least one first line treatment metastatic disease ; Patients may : - Contraindications high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : - PBMC obtain leukapheresis enrich CD4 cell transduce retroviral vector supernatant encode anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 TCR . - The study begin standard phase I dose escalation . After MTD cell dose determine , patient enrol phase 2 portion trial MTD establish phase I portion study . In phase 2 portion , patient enter two cohort : cohort 1 include patient metastatic melanoma ; cohort 2 include patient renal cancer type metastatic cancer . - Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion ex vivo tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin . - Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor response every 1-6 month study criterion meet . - For 2 stratum evaluate phase 2 portion , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . - For stratum , objective determine treatment regimen able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
