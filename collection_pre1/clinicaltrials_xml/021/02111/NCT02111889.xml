	<detailed_description>Rationale : Multiple agent target specific signal protein important tumor growth angiogenesis , include ( tyrosine ) kinase inhibitor monoclonal antibody , develop reach clinical approval . In general , however , target agent induce response subgroup cancer patient , expose potential toxic therapy . Prior treatment , unknown patient respond kinase inhibitor effective , , patient . Clearly , need non-invasive vivo technique identify patient may benefit treatment specific drug . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) non-invasive technique enables quantitative measurement molecular pathway interaction picomolar sensitivity , , potential fulfill need mention . We expect response kinase inhibitor dependent achieve active drug level tumor tissue . Currently , intratumoral kinase inhibitor level investigate institution ( ICK study ) . However , measurement require fresh tumor biopsy . We hypothesize radiolabeled kinase inhibitor PET image quantify concentration label drug tumor lesion , thereby avoid burdensome biopsy future . Objective : The main objective study determine whether tumor concentration kinase inhibitor pharmacological active dos predict PET study use tracer amount ( microdosing ) correspond radiolabeled kinase inhibitor . This objective include development validation pharmacokinetic model radiolabeled kinase inhibitor well validation microdosing concept kinase inhibitor . The secondary objective include exploration whether kinase inhibitor kinetics depend perfusion ( measure [ 15O ] water PET ) size ( measure diagnostic CT/MRI ) tumor lesion , investigate presence sink accumulate kinase inhibitor , investigate ( ) activation key pathway target specific kinase inhibitor . Study design : Single center , non-randomized , interventional proof concept study . Study population : Adult patient advance , biopsy accessible tumor standard palliative treatment kinase inhibitor investigate study , i.e . erlotinib sorafenib , indicate . Intervention : Patients treat kinase inhibitor accord standard treatment . [ 11C ] kinase inhibitor PET ( i.e . sorafenib erlotinib study , aim investigate others future study ) [ 15O ] water PET perform two week treatment . Tumor biopsy perform therapy . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Enrollment study require two tumor biopsy , 2x [ 11C ] kinase inhibitor PET , 2x [ 15O ] water PET arterial blood sampling . The biopsy may cause physical discomfort . During therapy , follow-up include standard laboratory analysis well regular visit outpatient clinic . The radiation exposure acceptable . Patients treat kinase inhibitor standard therapy may benefit disease regression stabilization proven clinical benefit patient population investigation . The result kinase inhibitor PET imaging study strongly supportive development non-invasive , personalized treatment strategy thereby avoid 1 ) cumbersome tumor biopsy , 2 ) unwanted exposure potentially toxic drug 3 ) costly therapy without clinical benefit .</detailed_description>
