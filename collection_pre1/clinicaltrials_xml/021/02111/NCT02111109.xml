	<brief_summary>Haemorrhage follow major trauma important preventable cause death . Those patient survive may prolong period debility cause failure key body organ . We suspect important contributor organ failure may dysfunction network small blood vessel supply body organ oxygen nutrient . Our study examine link microcirculation organ failure patient suffer significant bleeding traumatic injury . We also explore relationship resuscitation global circulation ( blood pressure , cardiac output etc . ) area monitor clinical practice state microcirculation , contrast monitor . Patients severe traumatic injury commonly problem blood clot . Some researcher suggest microcirculatory failure may important contributor problem explore detail . Finally , attempt examine mechanism microcirculation may disrupt trauma subsequent bleeding . These may include inappropriate activation white blood cell , inadequate function oxygen carry red blood cell change cell line small blood vessel . We use non invasive method ass microcirculation term Side Stream Dark Field microscopy . This involve record video image movement blood within small blood vessel patient tongue . In addition use ultrasound ass flow blood heart . Small sample blood take assess blood clot look possible mechanism microcirculatory dysfunction . We aim study ten patient first instance . The study carry within intensive care unit Kings College Hospital .</brief_summary>
