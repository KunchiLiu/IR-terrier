	<brief_summary>This trial design randomize two-arm ( LDE225 vs. observation group ) open-label prospective clinical trial men localize high-risk prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy . The investigator propose determine effect LDE225 neoplastic prostate tissue men high risk systemic disease progression , compare pre-surgical core-biopsy specimen tumor tissue harvest time prostatectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pre-surgical Study LDE225 Men With High-risk Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-risk patient identify base core-needle biopsy feature , PSA level , clinical stage . After obtain baseline laboratory clinical value ( include ECG , PSA , hematologic , renal hepatic panel ) , men receive oral LDE225 800 mg/day observation daily 4 week ( ±3 day ) prior prostatectomy . Patients clinical visit ECG laboratory test perform 2 week 4 week , include 4-week pre-prostatectomy measurement PSA blood sample determine plasma LDE225 level . Men undergo radical prostatectomy ( bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy appropriate ) , point two 250-mg biopsy prostate tissue obtain , frozen store analysis .</detailed_description>

Patient able swallow retain oral medication 1 . Patients major surgery within 4 week enrollment . 2 . Patients concurrent uncontrolled medical condition may interfere participation study . 3 . Patients unable take oral drug ( e.g . lack physical integrity upper GI tract know malabsorption syndrome ) . 4 . Patients previously treat LDE225 Hh pathway inhibitor 5 . Patients neuromuscular muscular disorder ( e.g . inflammatory myopathy , muscular dystrophy , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal muscular atrophy ) concomitant treatment drug know cause rhabdomyolysis ( statins fibrates ) , discontinue least 2 week prior start LDE225 . If essential patient stay statin hyperlipidemia , pravastatin may use extra caution . Patients plan embark new strenuous exercise regimen initiation study treatment . ( NB : Muscular activity , strenuous exercise , result significant increase plasma CK level avoid whilst LDE225 treatment ) . 6 . Patients take part experimental drug study within 4 week 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) initiate treatment LDE225 . 7 . Patients receive antineoplastic therapy ( e.g . chemotherapy , target therapy radiotherapy ) concurrently within 2 week start LDE225 . 8 . Patients take moderate/strong inhibitor inducer CYP3A4/5 drug metabolize CYP2B6 CYP2C9 narrow therapeutic index , discontinue start treatment LDE225 . Medications strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor discontinue least 7 day strong CYP3A/5 inducer least 2 week prior start treatment LDE225 . 9 . No concurrent use statin ( except pravastatin , absolutely necessary ) 10 . No concurrent warfarin Coumadinderivatives 11 .
