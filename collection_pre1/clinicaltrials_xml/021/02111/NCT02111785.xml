	<brief_summary>Chronic subdural hematoma ( cSDH ) condition blood slowly leak small blood vessel surround brain . Over time , blood may cause variety symptom include headache , confusion , limb weakness , difficulty speaking . There currently agreement among physician best way treat condition . One option surgery drain blood collect . Usually surgery involve drill small hole skull relieve pressure allow blood fluid drain . Another option give medication steroid might reduce swell . However , drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) specifically treat condition . Some patient elect treatment . The purpose study investigate whether investigational treatment 2 week course oral dexamethasone effective surgery cSDH . The study hypothesis test : For patient unilateral , symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma , difference clinical outcome , measure achievement modify Rankin Score 0-2 6 month , treat 2 week course oral dexamethasone , compare treat burr hole surgical drainage .</brief_summary>
