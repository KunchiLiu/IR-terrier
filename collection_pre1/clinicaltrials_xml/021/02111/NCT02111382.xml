	<brief_summary>Osteopathic medicine base diagnostic therapeutic system treat tissue mobility/ motility dysfunction general , use different approach ( depend target tissue ) know osteopathic manipulative treatment . Among available technique one address cranial field question lack scientific evidence ; compression 4th ventricle technique largely studied clinical trial . Studies show technique may affect central autonomous nervous system , modulate reflex ( Traube-Hering baro signal ) , modify brain cortex electrical activity central sensitization subject chronic low back pain . Thus , investigator hypothesize compression 4th ventricle may modulate peak alpha frequency ( electroencephalographic assessment ) promote physical relaxation subject vigil .</brief_summary>
