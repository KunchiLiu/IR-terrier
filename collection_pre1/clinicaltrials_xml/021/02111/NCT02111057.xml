	<brief_summary>Researchers Hospital Special Surgery try learn post-operative rheumatoid arthritis flare ( RA ) . This study hop understand RA flare total joint replacement surgery result flare patient next year . We ask patient RA , whether gotten bad , whether able work physical therapist . During course study , 'll collect questionnaire , 'll draw blood well understand 's go RA patient 's recuperation joint replacement . We want understand whether flare RA might affect outcome patient 's joint replacement . We believe study might show u good manage patient rheumatoid arthritis follow joint replacement . If RA patient flare unable participate physical therapy worse one year total hip replacement , effective treatment could develop . The study also help u identify early factor may influence long-term outcome joint replacement RA patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The condition study worsening ( flare ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) patient undergone arthroplasty . RA patient undergo arthroplasty often severe , erosive disease . If rate flare approach estimate 26 % rate suggest previous study RA patient arthroplasty ( Johnson ACR 2011 ) , could significance regard long term arthroplasty disease outcome . Patients flare may able participate post-operative rehabilitation think necessary optimal arthroplasty outcome , may difficult patient flare discontinue immunosuppressant medication surgery regain remission low disease activity . Detailed clinical data collect longitudinally RA patient severe erosive disease undergo arthroplasty conjunction characterization molecular profile blood operative tissue could provide valuable information inform best practice patient group .</detailed_description>
