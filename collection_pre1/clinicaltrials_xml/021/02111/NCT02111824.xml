	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study test use minimally invasive multimodality image-guided ( MIMIG ) intervention system use perform lung biopsy . The safety MIMIG intervention system also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multimodality Image-guided System Peripheral Lung Cancer Diagnosis Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group 2 : If patient agrees take part study , follow information routine standard care lung biopsy collect : The accuracy procedure How long take complete procedure How long needle insert collect biopsy sample The number CT scan use procedure The radiation dose level use Any complication and/or side effect patient may experience The result diagnosis biopsy sample Researchers take appropriate step keep patient 's information private . However , guarantee absolute privacy . The patient 's information keep password-protected computer MD Anderson 7 year permit view study doctor member research staff . During patient 's routine lung biopsy , doctor use MIMIG intervention system help guide needle biopsy lung biopsy . Length Study : The patient 's active participation study lung biopsy procedure . Description Procedure : The first CT scan use map guide needle tumor MIMIG intervention system . After , second CT scan do confirm needle tip properly insert inside lung tumor . Based result image , tumor biopsied way would part normal routine care . This investigational study . The use MIMIG intervention system help guide needle lung biopsy FDA approve commercially available . The use MIMIG intervention system investigational . Up 24 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson . Group 3 : If patient agrees take part study , follow information patient 's routine standard care lung biopsy collect : The accuracy procedure How long take complete procedure How long needle insert collect biopsy sample The number CT scan use procedure The radiation dose level use Any complication and/or side effect patient may experience The result diagnosis biopsy sample Researchers take appropriate step keep patient 's information private . However , guarantee absolute privacy . The patient 's information keep password-protected computer MD Anderson permit view study doctor member research staff . During patient 's routine lung biopsy , doctor use MIMIG intervention system help guide needle biopsy lung biopsy . The patient also intravenous ( IV ) needle place patient 's vein give patient indocyanine green ( IC-Green ) . IC-Green dye allow researcher see patient 's vein organs biopsy . Length Study : After lung biopsy complete , patient 's active participation study . Description Procedure : The first CT scan use map guide needle tumor MIMIG intervention system . After , second CT scan do confirm needle tip properly insert inside lung tumor . A fiberoptic endoscope ( small camera light ) insert CT guide needle tumor help doctor see tumor blood vessel . IC-Green also give IV allow doctor see blood vessel tumor . Based result image , tumor biopsied way would part normal routine care . This investigational study . The use MIMIG intervention system help guide needle lung biopsy FDA approve commercially available . The use MIMIG intervention system investigational . The use fiberoptic endoscope lung tumor vessel image FDA approve commercially available . The use fiberoptic endoscope investigational . The use IC-Green combination fiberoptic endoscope lung tumor vessel image FDA approve commercially available . The use IC-Green combination fiberoptic endoscope investigational . Up 24 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
