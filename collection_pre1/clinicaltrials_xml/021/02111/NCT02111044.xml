	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate acromegalic patient effect different dos ITF2984 GH IGF-1 concentration investigate safety tolerability three different dos ITF2984 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study With ITF2984 Acromegalic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll patient active acromegaly , de novo partial responder previous treatment somatostatin analogue . For patient previously receive medical therapy acromegaly washout period study entry 3 month long-acting formulation somatostatin analog , 2 week octreotide sc , 2 month pegvisomant and/or cabergoline must foresee . Each patient randomize wll remain study 6 month , attend visit every two week . The patient treat 4 month total , particular every month treatment follow washout period 2 week . At month treatment patient receive one four treatment report : Octreotide 100 mcg sc three time daily ( t.i.d ) 4 week , ITF2984 500 mcg sc twice day ( b.i.d ) 4 week , ITF2984 1000 mcg sc b.i.d 4 week , ITF2984 2000 mcg sc b.i.d 4 week . Patients randomize use 4 way crossover design receive ITF2984 octreotide treatment month . Each patient receive four treatment overseen study .</detailed_description>
