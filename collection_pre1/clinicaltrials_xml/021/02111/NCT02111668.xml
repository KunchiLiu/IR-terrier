	<detailed_description>Background Aortic dilatation syndrome comprise group different syndrome , Marfan syndrome best described . Marfan syndrome heritable connective tissue disorder associate mutation fibrillin‐1 gene ( FBN1 ) . The genetic diversity wide 1000 different mutation FBN1 . Until many instance expensive , difficult time consume get correct genetic diagnosis ; use next generation sequencing ( NGS ) 1 ; 2 potential make diagnosis faster , safer much cheap . Mutations TGFβR1 TGFβR2 gene also give rise Marfan syndrome phenotype , also Loeys‐Dietz syndrome Familial Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm syndrome . Mutations gene lead clinical suspicion Marfan syndrome relate syndrome like Ehler‐Danlos syndrome , Weill‐Marchesani syndrome well others 3 . Sporadic occurrence due de novo mutation see 20‐30 % diagnosed case Marfan Syndrome 4 ; 5 . New diagnostic revise criterion present 2010 3 . The frequency Marfan syndrome study study divergent result . In one Chinese study 1990 prevalence 17.2 per 100,000 found , compare study 1997 prevalence 4.6 per 100,000 6‐9 . Preliminary run available registry suggest 1000‐2000 individual Marfan syndrome exist Denmark , substantially high prevalence mention study . The pattern symptom diseases syndrome quite vary , typical involvement cardiovascular , ocular skeletal system . New study also show increased frequency migraine , sleep apnea cholelithiasis Marfan syndrome probably range symptom trait still describe 10‐15 . There well know increase mortality among Marfan patient due cardiovascular cause , aortic dilatation dissection . However , study small study ; one American/Scottish study 1993 find increase lifespan 48 year 1972 72 year 1993 16‐19 . Data lifespan thoracic aortic dilatation syndrome scant . And likewise much know quality life socio‐economic condition Marfan syndrome relate syndrome . It possible increased morbidity mortality relate syndrome affect socio‐economic condition adversely , speculate Marfan syndrome 20‐23 . The skeletal manifestation first describe AB Marfan original description syndrome 1896 24 , century later , many facet syndrome still well characterize , many study conduct select group Marfan syndrome patient , make problematic extrapolate data . Denmark excellent registry ; represent unique possibility study rare disease like Marfan related syndrome concern morbidity , mortality socio‐economy , long diagnosis certain . We previously study range rare syndromes manner 25‐31 . However , diagnosis Marfan syndrome range Thoracic Aorta Dilatation syndrome still problematic goal present study improve diagnosis also characterization syndrome . Likewise , aim identify new mutation , especially frequent condition like bicuspid aortic valve ( 0.46‐1.37 % population ) , often lead aortic dilatation need surgical intervention 32 . Bicuspid aortic valve syndrome follow autosomal dominant inheritance incomplete penetrance male predominance ( 3:1 ) , point towards gene X chromosome involve 33 . We identify patient Marfan syndrome patient thoracic aortic dilatation syndrome use multi‐facetted approach . Patients identified combination available registry Denmark ( The National Registry Discharge Diagnoses , The Registry Causes Death , The Cancer Registry ) department taking care patient ( 2 Centres Rare Diseases Copenhagen Aarhus , 3 large Departments Cardiology ) . In project provide unique combination front line molecular technology well define patient cohort . The aim study follow : 1 . To establish rapid cheap genetic test diagnosis syndrome combine fashion . 2 . To establish incidence syndrome Denmark . 3 . To establish morbidity , mortality socio‐economic pattern syndrome . 4 . To examine genotype‐phenotype relation . Study population From preliminary run National Registry Discharge Diagnoses , expect include 500‐1000 person Marfan syndrome . Some aortic surgery tissue specimens available . The remain syndrome few number expect altogether include 100‐500 person . Likewise , aortic surgery tissue specimens available . For every case ( Marfan syndrome ) identify 100 sex age‐matched control Statistics Denmark enable u calculate precise estimate morbidity , mortality socio‐economic measure . Methods &amp; Endpoints The NGS technology enable procurement large amount sequence data either entire targeted part genome . We sequence entire exom thereafter target specific gene like FBN1 , TGFβR1 TGFβR2 others ( find 40 gene interest number still rise ) . The capacity NGS large aim sequence number patient run . This speed diagnostic process reduce cost substantially . Changes find one patient compare available database variation human genome ( SNPdb HapMap ) . The DNA sequence examine gene allow genotype characterization , correlate phenotype give individual . Both known new mutation expectedly find , expect find single‐base mutation well genomic rearrangement ( indels ) . We use tissue sample aorta relevant tissue correlation mutational status , level messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression protein amount , thus , obtain functional information . In later project study functional aspect genomic aberration cell model . Digital gene expression value find use Cufflinks mutation , SNPs indels , call use BWA SNP‐caller , copy number variation call use CNV‐seq . We perform deep coverage DNA RNA sample validation purportedly genomic event mutation , SNPs breakpoints . Bioinformatics carry supervision expert Department Molecular Medicine bioinformatics group . We aim devise new computerize technique analysis sequence data . Epidemiology The population patient describe mention , genetic characterization study morbidity , mortality incidence different syndrome . We link different registry estimate use prescription medicine use registry Statistics Denmark study socio‐economic outcome different syndrome . We develop table expect clinical manifestation syndrome group eventually link certain mutation ( gene - function relationship ) , thus able predict outcome individual . The table include age onset , likelihood symptom , etc . Statistical method Incidence rate calculate case per 100.000 per year analyse use Poisson regression . Morbidity mortality describe use Kaplan‐Meier curve , log‐rank test Cox regression . Socio‐economic data analyse use conditional logistic regression . Permissions collaborative partner Permission Science Ethical Committee accept . There specific ethical consideration relation study , conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki . Permission different Registries employ sought Statistics Denmark accept permission . Patients include outpatient clinic 2 center Rare Disease Denmark 4 large Departments Cardiology . Data store analysed Department Molecular Medicine , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby . Clinical importance The describe syndrome impact high cost society ( &gt; 3000 individual various clinical manifestation ) , successful able identify family syndromes prevent disease , well diagnose much earlier lead well life quality reduce treatment cost society . Furthermore , precise description genetic background likely lead much well treatment instance hypertension ( angiotensin blocker instead beta blocker treatment ) . Publications The described study lead range publication . All involved clinical department mention Acknowledgements future publication .</detailed_description>
