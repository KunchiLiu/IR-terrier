	<brief_summary>Background : The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 100 patient . In study , select specific subset white blood cell tumor think effective fighting tumor use cell make tumor fight cell . Objective : The purpose study see specifically select tumor fight cell cause melanoma tumor shrink see treatment safe . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-70 metastatic melanoma tumor safely remove . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need - Surgery : If patient meet requirement study undergo surgery remove tumor use grow TIL product . - Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis obtain additional white blood cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , TIL cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using 41BB Selected Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) follow high dose aldesleukin mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer patient follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - In animal model , mix irrelevant ( non-reactive ) cell tumor-reactive cell negatively impact tumor treatment possibly compete cytokine , suggest enrichment tumor-reactive cell could enhance clinical efficacy . Additionally , preclinical animal model clinical investigation demonstrate prolonged vitro culture negatively impact tumor treatment . - The current method enrichment tumor-reactive TIL require screen multiple independent TIL culture anti-tumor specificity use gamma-interferon production TIL . However , vitro screen depends autologous tumor reagent often unavailable , IFN gamma release vitro may best effector function evaluate tumor recognition . The screen increase length vitro culture time ( 30 day ) , result shorter telomere length differentiate cell . Additionally , selection highly reactive culture expansion may reduce diversity CD8+ repertoire recognize tumor . - 4-1BB co-stimulatory molecule up-regulated cell surface T cell upon TCR engagement . Pre-clinical study Surgery Branch evaluate fast simplify method select expand diverse tumor-reactive repertoire , regardless knowledge specific antigen recognize , base selection 4-1BB express TIL fresh tumor digest . Objectives : - To determine safety objective response rate patient metastatic melanoma receive ACT use 4-1BB select TIL plus aldesleukin treatment follow chemotherapy preparative regimen . - To determine survival patient receive treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients 18 year old must : - Evaluable metastatic melanoma ; - Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable surgical resection preparation TIL ; - No contraindication high-dose aldesleukin administration ; - No concurrent major medical illness form immunodeficiency Design : - Patients metastatic melanoma lesion resect 4-1BB express tumor infiltrate lymphocyte isolate use FACS sorter approve clinical use . The 4-1BB selected cell rapidly expand vitro administer plus aldesleukin follow non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen . - The study conduct use stage 2 optimal design determine treatment able associate clinical response rate rule 10 % ( p0=0.10 ) favor modest 30 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.30 ) . - Up 35 patient may enrol 2 year .</detailed_description>

Patients must progress disease prior treatment . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion Section 2.1.1 . 16 . Six week must elapse time antibody therapy could affect anti cancer immune response , include antiCTLA4 antibody therapy time patient receives preparative regimen allow antibody level decline .
