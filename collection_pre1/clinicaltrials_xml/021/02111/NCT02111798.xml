	<detailed_description>The efficacy behavior therapy may enhance certain medication , particularly act dopaminergic system . The purpose project examine effect bupropion initiation maintenance cocaine abstinence population cocaine dependent methadone maintenance patient . Bupropion appear promising medication purpose previously demonstrate efficacy safety well pharmacological action dopamine system . Methadone maintain cocaine dependent patient participate ( N = 200 ) . Volunteers eligible inclusion study 1 ) enrol methadone maintenance treatment , previously meet criterion opioid dependence ; 2 ) age 18 65 ; 3 ) provide evidence cocaine dependence ( DSM-IV criterion , self-report , and/or urine test positive cocaine intake process ) ; 4 ) willing take study medication adhere report data collection schedule . Exclusion Criteria : 1 ) history epilepsy seizure , include alcohol- cocaine-related seizure ; 2 ) condition increase risk seizure ( e.g . head trauma loss consciousness &gt; 30 min ) , 3 ) current use ( past 30 day ) antidepressant , antipsychotic , theophyillines , systemic steroid , MAO-A inhibitor , 4 ) recent use ( past 30 day medication contain bupropion budeprion ( Wellbutrin® , Zyban® ) , 5 ) allergy bupropion budeprion , 6 ) liver enzyme level great 3x ULN ; 7 ) uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ( glucose &gt; 200mg % ) ; 8 ) severe psychiatric diagnosis : schizophrenia , psychosis , major depression , mania , current suicidal ideation plan ; cognitive impairment severe enough preclude informed consent valid response questionnaire ; 9 ) severe renal insufficiency ( eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min ) , 10 ) pregnant , breast feeding unwilling use birth control , 11 ) medical illness view investigator would compromise participation research , 12 ) advance HIV infection require HAART 13 ) current eat disorder ( anorexia bulimia ) , 14 ) uncontrolled hypertension BO &gt; 140/90 . Study participant qualify sign inform consent stratify accord initial response abstinence incentive ( contingency management ) procedure target cocaine negative urine . Those stop cocaine use enter study examine effect bupropion XL ( 300mg/day ) versus placebo relapse prevention . Those fail stop cocaine use initial exposure CM procedure enter parallel study conduct concurrently examines effect bupropion XL ( 300mg/day ) abstinence initiation . Our hypothesis bupropion compare placebo treatment enhance rate abstinence initiation difficulty stop cocaine retard rate relapse initially stop cocaine use . Each study involve CM schedule uniquely tailored question ask equated total amount earn ( $ 675 ) . Both study track outcomes 6-month time frame include assessment drug use outcomes incentive stop . In addition , project provide novel information mechanism medication effect measure subjective drug effect , drug v money choice , self-reports pleasure derive daily non-drug activity . The investigator hypothesize bupropion compare placebo participant report non-drug activity pleasurable ( reinforce ) , engage measure non-drug reinforcement mediate abstinence outcome . Overall , research provide new valuable information combine behavioral-pharmacological treatment specifically condition medication may enhance effect CM . If hypothesize synergy demonstrate , study point way significant advance improve treatment outcomes critical group drug abuser . The propose study compel conceptually differentiate two key clinical issue treatment stimulant abusers- abstinence initiation relapse prevention . It use design efficiently effectively test combine treatment approach clinical issue well examines cognitive function reinforcement-based mediator . The research add understanding interplay brain reinforcement system drug-seeking behavior . Finally , make important contribution behavioral therapy development explore novel solution limitation previously note CM include lack response patient relapse withdrawal incentive .</detailed_description>
