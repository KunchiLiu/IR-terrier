	<brief_title>Study Symptomatic Effects Nocturnal Sodium Oxybate Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Non-motor symptom excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) markedly impair quality life Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) patient . Beside disturb character symptom , EDS example also link decrease cognitive ability mood , i.e . depression [ 1,2 ] . The prominent cause EDS disruption nocturnal sleep [ 3 ] . Furthermore disrupted nocturnal sleep also likely influence quality life partner caregiver . This aspect non-motor symptom investigate detail far . In conclusion , firmly convinced improvement nocturnal sleep PD patient promise potential strategy reduce several symptom adverse event PD patient partner caregiver . Moreover , sleep modulation recently introduce approach potential neuroprotective strategy , e.g . since sleep deprivation link neurodegenerative process brain [ 4,5 ] . It already show recent study nocturnal application sodium oxybate PD patient improve nocturnal sleep quality , accompany reduction EDS [ 6 ] . There , however , significant methodological limitation study , since single-arm , open-label , uncontrolled study . In summary , nocturnal application sodium oxybate seem promising treatment PD patient , methodologically correct evidence still lack . Investigational Product The investigational product use study Xyrem , approve Swissmedic June 2006 treatment cataplexies patient narcolepsy . Xyrem belongs class sedative . The chemical name sodium oxybate sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate molecular formula C4H7NaO3 . Xyrem oral solution contain 500 mg sodium oxybate per milliliter USP Purified Water , neutralize pH 7.5 malic acid . It take orally night split dose regime . It eliminate mainly metabolism half-life 0.5 1 hour . Pharmacokinetics nonlinear blood level increase 3.8â€‘fold dose double 4.5 9 g. The pharmacokinetics alter repeat dosing . The exact mechanism Xyrem unknown . However , Xyrem enhance deep sleep therefore strengthen nocturnal sleep . Since disturbed nocturnal sleep EDS major non-motor symptom patient suffer PD aim investigate profit Xyrem application PD patient ( detailed information see Arzneimittel-Kompendium der Schweiz 2012 ) . Clinical Data Date An uncontrolled open-label study administer nocturnal sodium oxybate excessive daytime sleepiness PD [ 6 ] . No tested treatment far - stimulant , continuous dopaminergic stimulation overnight - yield dramatic improvement EDS : mean Epworth sleepiness scale value drop 15.6 point ( severe sleepiness , comparable patient narcolepsy ) 9.0 ( normal value ) ( Table 1 ) . In addition , sleep quality fatigue improve well . In term safety , Apnea-Hypopnea-Index ( AHI ) go 7 13 , oxygen saturation remain stable sodium oxybate [ 6 ] . There , however , significant methodological limitation study . First , open-label , second , excessive daytime sleepiness assess subjective measure , i.e . validated questionnaire . Dose Rationale The standard maximal dose , correspond maximal dose use study , 9g ( corresponds 18ml ) per night split dose regime . As Xyrem approve long-term use apply 6 week current study , specific precaution concern duration intake do . The exclusion criterion present study meet contraindication case Xyrem application list Swissmedic : subject include case pregnancy , application CNS sedative drug ( opioids , barbiturate ) , severe medical condition liver failure , renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure severe depression . As drug , Xyrem potentially case lead several adverse event . Since maximal dose also accompany high occurrence adverse event , initial dose set 3g per night , even suggest start dose accord `` Arzneimittelcompendium '' carefully stepwise increase individual optimal dose carefully . The key feature safe application accurate monitoring patient , warrant regular visit phone call present study . Xyrem associate potential breathing depression . In study Ondo et al . [ 6 ] total apnea mildly increase application nocturnal sodium oxybate , whereas oxygen de-/saturation value remain stable . Nevertheless , subject elevate AHI low oxygen saturation include present study ( see exclusion criterion section 7.2 ) . However , AHI measure drug application subject , allow good evaluation aspect future . Up date , approve medication sleep disturbance EDS PD . So far , application nocturnal sodium oxybate reveal large improvement PD patient . Modafinil Rivotril demonstrate benefit EDS sleep PD patient . However , medication really alternative treatment since effect moderate experience application PD patient still insufficient . Risk/Benefits Ethical Considerations Xyrem drug license FDA Swissmedic use patient narcolepsy , tolerability clinical practice good . It known use Xyrem lead improvement quality nocturnal sleep patient suffer narcolepsy , reduce EDS . In deal patient well know sleep disturbance kind ( endogenous well exogenous ) impair daytime vigilance time quality life . It known non-motor symptom PD , i.e . EDS , major impact quality life patient - well carers . Improving nocturnal sleep would therefore promising possibility enhance patient ' daytime wellbeing . In addition mention symptomatic effect EDS , sleep modulation might future emerge potential disease modulate strategy . Experimental animal data show aggravation neurodegenerative disease sleep restriction ( 6 ) - currently investigation sleep modulation work opposite way well . Thereby control risk mention adverse event section 4.5 must see relation potential benefit improve quality life patient carers well potential influence motor non-motor symptom long-term disease modification .</detailed_description>
