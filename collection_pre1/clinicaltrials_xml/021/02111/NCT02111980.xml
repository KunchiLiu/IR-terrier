	<brief_summary>If surgical sponge mistakenly leave inside patient 's body surgical procedure , cause serious infection . To prevent happen , new device develop us radiofrequency ( RF ) signal detect presence surgical sponge inside body . The device use routinely make sure sponge leave inside patient end operation . However , RF device implement procedure patient cardiac implantable electronic device ( CIEDs ) . While device FDA approve use , theoretical concern radiofrequency signal use detect sponge change setting pacemaker defibrillator . Changing setting pacemaker might make pace heart quickly slowly , change setting defibrillator might cause unnecessary shock prevent shock heart patient cardiac arrest . The purpose study test whether radiofrequency device use detect sponge cause clinically significant change setting pacemaker defibrillator . To minimize potential risk , device test patient pacemaker defibrillator remove replaced part regular medical care , either infected battery worn . Before pacemaker defibrillator remove , setting carefully completely recorded radiofrequency device use scan body sponge would do normal operation . After pacemaker defibrillator take , setting record compare setting scan . In standard device removal procedure , clinically significant change CIED setting would expect . If new pacemaker defibrillator implant patient , expose detection device . We also test whether RF device effect temporary pacemaker patient may receive open heart surgery . We plan perform test total 50 patient , 40 permanent pacemaker defibrillator 10 temporary pacemaker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Retained surgical item ( e.g. , sponge , needle , instrument ) among frequently report medical error occur estimate 1 5000 operation . A retained surgical item frequently cause serious negative outcome , include re-operation ( 70-80 % case ) , readmission prolong hospital stay ( 30-60 % case ) , sepsis ( 43 % case ) , death ( 2 % case ) . Retained surgical item class `` never event '' Centers Medicare Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , CMS reimburse additional medical care relate treatment complication . Sponges far common retain item estimate account 50-70 % case . The standard method ensure sponge leave inside body manual counting . Manual counting , however , carry sensitivity specificity 77 % 99 % , respectively . In one study 62 % retained item detect count report normal . If manual count suggest sponge retain , standard method detect take radiograph . Radiographs , however , time-consuming one large retrospective study fail detect retain item 33 % case . The standard method detect retain surgical sponge clearly suboptimal . Radiofrequency ( RF ) technology recently employ improve detection retain surgical sponge . A radiofrequency chip sewn fabric sponge , circular wand emits radiofrequency signal pass patient . The wand also serve antenna detects return signal chip sponge . If chip detect trigger audio visual alarm console attach wand . In study involve 210 patient , RF detection system 100 % sensitivity specificity detect retain sponge , even morbidly obese patient . To minimize human error scan process , new system develop patient lie mat emits RF signal serf antenna . In separate study involve 203 patient , system use RF mat sensitivity specificity 98.5 % 100 % respectively . To carry study , sponge place underneath patient blind manner . Although would seem RF detection system superior manual counting , emphasize RF detection system substitute manual counting , rather adjunct manual counting . The RF Assure ® Detection System manufacture RF Surgical System Inc. routinely use detect retain sponge operate room University California , San Diego ( UCSD ) ~200 hospital . There concern radio frequency signal emit RF Assure® device might reprogram setting CIED pacemaker internal cardiac defibrillator ( ICDs ) , since CIEDs commonly program remotely use RF signal . For reason , technology commonly use surgery patient CIEDs . In vitro test do control set ass compatibility RF Surgical Detection Technology permanent pacemaker ICDs well temporary pacemaker , specifically Boston Scientific Cognis , St. Jude Medical Promote , Medtronic Virtuoso device , find interference RF Assure® system device . Although anecdotal experience vitro test indicated RF Assure® system affect CIEDs , establish whether RF Assure® system suitable use patient CIEDs clinical setting . The purpose study determine whether RF Assure® device actually reprogram CIEDs cause malfunction use routine clinical practice . This question particular importance rise number surgical patient , especially cardiac patient , implant CIED .</detailed_description>
