	<detailed_description>Background : The mechanism responsible gingival tissue damage poorly understood , immune-mediated reaction direct cytopathic effect bacteria maybe involve . Based direct effect bacteria cell culture , suggest apoptosis might play important role periodontitis ( Chen 1994 ) . Programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) normal physiologic process contributes maintain tissue homeostasis . The process apoptosis modulate various stimuli hormone , cytokine , growth factor , infection immune-responses ( Renehan et al . 2001 ) . Among factor , product two gene encode protein p53 Bcl-2 show play fundamental regulatory role apoptosis . P53 protein product tumor-suppressor gene , expression P53 induce apoptosis . This protein also implicate regulation tissue dynamic , specifically think induce apoptosis terminally differentiate cell , include inflammatory cell ( Bulut et al.2006 ) . Fibroblast type cell synthesize extracellular collagen connective tissue . It play critical role wound heal . Fibroblasts common cell connective tissue . The main function fibroblast maintain structural integrity connective tissue continuously secrete precursor extracellular matrix . report apoptosis level increase gingivitis periodontitis ( Jarenberg et al . 2002 ) . Cigarette smoke risk factor many disease , recent evidence indicate smoke adversely influence periodontal health . A number epidemiologic study show strong association smoking prevalence severity periodontitis ( Bostrom et al . 1998 ) . Whereas , pathogenesis periodontitis smoker poorly understood data suggest smoking effect periodontal tissue include defect neutrophil function , impaired serum antibody responses periodontal pathogen , potentially diminish gingival fibroblast function ( Shivanaikar et al . 2001 ) . Smokers consider high-risk group periodontitis , smoke history useful clinical predictor future disease activity ( Hanokia et al . 2000 ) . Aims study : - Investigation effect smoke fibroblast apoptosis smoker periodontitis compare non-smokers periodontitis use immuno-histochemical method . - Comparison apoptosis level gingival fibroblast chronic aggressive periodontitis . Materials method : A total 80 subject invite participate study patient refer Department Periodontology , Faculty Dentistry , University Damascus . The study approve specific Review Board . Subjects recruit accord specific inclusion criterion completion medical dental history questionnaire . Patients sign consent form advise nature study . The selection patient make accord criterion approve 1999 international world workshop classification system periodontal disease condition ( Armitage 1999 ) use five clinical parameter full mouth panoramic radiograph diagnosis . Subjects allocate four group : - Smoking Chronic Periodontitis group ( ChP-S ) : comprise 20 patient smoker age &gt; 45 year presence ≥2 non-adjacent site per quadrant first molars incisor , probe depth ( PD ) ≥5 mm , bleed gentle probing . The demonstrated radiographic bone loss ≥30 % root length , patient poor oral hygiene , amount accumulate plaque commensurate amount clinical attachment level ( CAL ) - Non-smoking Chronic periodontitis group ( ChP-NS ) : comprise 20 age-sex match patient non-smokers chronic periodontitis . - Smoking Aggressive Periodontitis group ( AgP-S ) : comprise 20 patient smoker age &lt; 35 year diagnose rapid attachment loss periodontal pocket depth ( PD ) &gt; 4 mm around least three teeth first molar incisor . Rapid bone destruction ( &gt; 50 % bone loss diseased site ) . Weak relationship dental plaque severity gingival inflammation . - Non-smoking Aggressive periodontitis group ( AgP-NS ) : comprise 20 age- sex match patient non-smokers aggressive periodontitis . Clinical measurement : A standard periodontal probe use record periodontal index six site per tooth . The examined clinical parameter include bleed probe ( BOP ) , plaque index ( PI ) , clinical attachment loss ( CAL ) periodontal pocket depth ( PPD ) gingival index ( GI ) . Biopsy collection analysis - The biopsy sample obtain patient surgical treatment ( open flap curettage ) biopsy take base area papilla . - Samples place 10 % formalin . - The sample instal paraffin wax . - Samples analyze mean p53 monoclonal mouse anti-human antibody .</detailed_description>
