	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability folate receptor alpha dendritic cell ( FRalphaDC ) vaccination ( folate receptor alpha-peptide load dendritic cell vaccine ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure time disease recurrence patient treat FRalphaDCs . II . Measure overall survival patient treat FRalphaDCs . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces increase number FRalpha-specific interleukin ( IL ) -17-secreting T helper ( Th ) cell , determine enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISpot ) . II . Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces increase number FRalpha-specific T cell secrete interferon ( IFN ) gamma , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha , IL-10 , granzyme B , determine ELISpot . III . Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces antibody specific FRalpha . IV . Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces delay type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) skin reaction specific FRalpha . V. Measure FRalpha expression patient ' primary tumor tumor recur FRalphaDC vaccine treatment ( available ) . VI . Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination associate change peripheral blood immune cell subset . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccine intradermally ( ID ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 5 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccine ID day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 month 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
