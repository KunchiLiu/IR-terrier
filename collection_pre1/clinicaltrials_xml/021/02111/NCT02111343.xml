	<brief_summary>The current study aim examine effectiveness Computer-based auditory training ( CBAT ) intervention child Central Auditory Processing Disorder ( CAPD ) comparing change auditory processing ( AP ) functional listening skill child immediately post-intervention , untrained control . The AP skill train group evaluate 3 month post-intervention examine sustainability improvement make CBAT intervention . I hypothesise intervention , child auditory training ( AT ) group would improve AP skill , improvement would great change AP skill untrained control . I also hypothesise improvement make intervention would sustain least 3 month end intervention . Finally , I examine train outcomes predictable underlying factor initial AP , language , cognitive skill child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective study incorporate parallel group design randomly assign participant identify CAPD auditory training ( AT ) group intervention ( Control ) group . Both group match age gender . Baseline measure conduct prior randomisation process . Participants AT group give 3-month home therapy use CBAT programme develop study , participant control group receive intervention period time . Apart regular school attendance activity , participant request discontinue auditory-based intervention , might affect outcome study . All participant assess conclusion training period . After end intervention , participant AT group request undergo no-intervention phase period 3 month another assessment . This intended examine sustainability improvement make CBAT programme . An auditory test two validate questionnaire use outcome measure , administer baseline , post-3 month ( immediately post-intervention ) .</detailed_description>
