	<brief_title>Immunoglobulin Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections : Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients necrotizing soft tissue infection ( NSTI ) receive intravenous polyspecific immunoglobulin G ( IVIG ) part standard treatment Rigshospitalet . The current evidence available support neither use IVIG , omit , adjuvant treatment NSTI . With trial investigator estimate effect IVIG patient-reported outcome important outcome patient NSTI Design A randomized , double-blinded , clinical trial patient randomly assign 1:1 receive either IVIG equal volume 0.9 % saline . Location A single centre trial conduct Dept . Intensive Care 4131 , Copenhagen University Hospital , Rigshospitalet . Randomisation Randomisation stratify accord primary presentation NSTI extremities/head/neck ( yes/no ) streptococci mainly affect anatomical site . Two randomisation list , vary block size , generate . Two separate box contain sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope ( SNOSE ) . Two people independent trial generate envelope follow randomisation list document envelope concordant randomisation list . Staff trial site access box around clock , draw envelope contain patient randomisation- medicine log document assign either `` Privigen '' `` Saline '' one two box . Intervention Trial medicine give patient arrives ICU follow two consecutive day . Alternatively , first dose trial medicine give operate theatre.The trial medicine consist either IVIG 25 g/day ( 250 ml ) ( Privigen , CSL Behring ) equal volume 0.9 % saline . The dosage IVIG 25g/day three consecutive day patient , accord clinical protocol Rigshospitalet . The treatment give accord clinical protocol Privigen Rigshospitalet . The treat clinician decide intervention . Blinding The trial medicine prepare ICU time arrival patient follow two consecutive day ICU nurse otherwise involve care trial patient supervise another staff member well involve care patient . Privigen slight yellowish appearance whereas saline clear . Furthermore , Privigen produce bottle 50 100 ml , respectively . A bottle Privigen pack bag saline , contain correspond number millilitre , black plastic bag seal plastic strip . An orange , transparent infusion set ( B. Braun , ref . 8700127SP ) insert either Privigen bottle bag contain saline , dependent whether patient allocate active treatment placebo . The orange colour mask fluid colour allow air bubble see . A piece non-transparent tape mask drip chamber make impossible see froth Privigen . For three dosage trial medicine , three bag prepare , contain 100 ml , 100 ml 50 ml respectively . The bag mark etiquette contain patient number . If unblinding necessary , easily do look envelope patient number . Medicine score The trial medicine batch number note patient randomisation- medicine log document ICU nurse prepare trial medicine . The attend physician prescribe `` trial medicine '' electronic medication file ( CIS 3.9.1 , Daintel ) . Subgroup Analysis Presumed Streptococcal Infection A subgroup analysis perform patient primary presentation NSTI extremity , neck head likely streptococcal infection , effect IVIG may different . Data Registration Data enter electronically , web-based case report form ( eCRF ) patient note trial personnel . The eCRF specifically design purpose . Safety Patients withdrawn trial protocol follow occurs : - SARs SUSARs Patients withdraw trial mention reason receive standard protocol treatment NSTI exception IVIG . During trial , Sponsor send yearly report occurrence SARs Danish Health Medicines Authority Regional Ethics Committee . Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( SUSARs ) define serious adverse reaction describe summary product characteristic ( SPC ) Privigen ( serious adverse reaction describe 0.9 % saline ) . Sponsor report SUSARs within 7 day Danish Health Medicines Authority via Eudravigilance Clinical Trials Module , Regional Ethics Committee CSL Behring . During trial , investigator send yearly report occurrence SUSARs Danish Health Medicines Authority Regional Ethics Committees . Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events Adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) record entity majority ICU patient experience several SAEs critical illness . In addition , SAEs capture secondary outcome measure ( SOFA score bleed ) . Termination Trial The trial terminate prematurely case new , definite information regard use IVIG patient NSTI arises . Sample Size Estimation 50 subject group need detect difference 7 point PCS SF-36 base expect score 42 ( SD 11 ) control group ( data follow-up study ) , power 80 % two-tailed significance level 0.05 , expect 1-year mortality rate 20 % . Statistical Methods Analysis intention-to-treat compare PCS SF-36 two group six month chi-squared test multiple logistic regression analysis use unadjusted analysis analysis adjust patient variable ( SAPS II SOFA score 24 h prior randomisation ) . Patients Included In Final Statistical Analysis Patients withdraw trial protocol follow analysed remain patient . Patients transfer another ICU follow primary outcome measure . Patients withdraw replaced new patient , exception specific case , patient demand deletion register data . Accountability Procedure Missing Data Imputation use missingness &gt; 5 % . Interim Analysis An interim analysis perform analyse sample size plan 100 patient less meaningful outcome relevance ( mortality SARs ) . Monitoring We perform Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) -monitoring accord predefined monitoring plan include follow issue : - Initiation visit - For patient : Documented informed consent - Inclusion exclusion criterion - Documented delivery non-delivery eCRF intervention accord protocol compare source data patient ' hospital record - Termination visit : Primary outcome Data Handling Record Keeping Data handle accord National Data Protection Agency , protect national law `` Loven om behandling af personoplysninger '' `` Sundhedsloven '' . All original record ( incl . consent form , eCRFs , relevant correspondence ) archive trial site 15 year . The clean electronic trial database file deliver Danish Data Archive maintain 15 year anonymised requested authority . Quality Control Quality Assurance The subinvestigator responsible prepare research nurse trial site personnel initiation trial . This education continuously document . Monitoring Intervention Groups Day-to-day monitoring eCRF do person delegate specific task . Ethics The trial adhere Helsinki Declaration Danish law . Inclusion start approval Regional Ethics Committee , Danish Health Medicines Authority National Data Protection Agency ( via Joint Notification System The Capital Region Denmark - Region Hovedstaden ) trial registration www.clinicaltrials.gov .</detailed_description>
