	<brief_summary>This study do evaluate efficacy safety drug combination grazoprevir ( GZR ; MK-5172 ) + elbasvir ( EBR ; MK-8742 ) participants chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype ( GT ) 1 , 4 , 6 infection cirrhosis Child-Pugh ( CP ) score 7-9 moderate hepatic insufficiency ( CP-B ) . The primary hypothesis percentage HCV-infected participant hepatic insufficiency ( CP-B population ) achieve sustain viral response ( SVR ) 12 week end treatment ( SVR12 ) great 60 % . Additionally , ten non-cirrhotic ( NC ) HCV-infected GT1 participant also give GZR + EBR begin study ; do purpose collect plasma pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data HCV GT1-infected participant hepatic insufficiency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Efficacy Safety Grazoprevir ( MK-5172 ) + Elbasvir ( MK-8742 ) Chronic Hepatitis C Participants With Child-Pugh ( CP ) -B Hepatic Insufficiency ( MK-5172-059 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct sequentially 3 Parts . Each participant participate one Part . Participants enrol either Part A , Part B , Part C : - Part A : CP-B participant receive GZR 50 mg+ EBR 50 mg ; NC participant receive GZR 100 mg/EBR 50 mg. - Part B : CP-B participant receive GZR 100 mg + EBR 50 mg. - Part C : CP-B participant receive either GZR 50 mg 100 mg + EBR 50 mg. Study progression Part A Part B Part B Part C base upon review safety efficacy Parts A B , respectively . Depending upon safety efficacy Part A , study may progress directly Part A Part C use GZR 50 mg + EBR 50 mg , without perform Part B .</detailed_description>
