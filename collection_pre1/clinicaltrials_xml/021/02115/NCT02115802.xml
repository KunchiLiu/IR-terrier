	<criteria>Potential participant must undergo DBS lead placement Parkinson 's Disease require awake microelectrode recording . Potential participant treat levodopa/carbidopa , dopamine agonist , maximal tolerate dos determine movement disorder neurologist . Potential participant must Hoehn Yahr stage &gt; = 2 medication OFF state . Potential participant must document improvement motor sign versus dopaminergic medication , change Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale motor ( UPDRS III ) score &gt; = 30 % medication . Patients tremor predominant form PD , quantify UPDRS tremor score one limb great equal 3 UPDRS sum axial score ( speech , posture , gait , balance ) less equal 5 , reach 30 % threshold , may include . Potential participant must evidence complication medication , e.g. , wear sign , fluctuate response and/or dyskinesia , and/or medication refractory tremor , and/or impairment quality life medication . Potential participant must ability understand instruction English . Potential participant male female age 21 75 . Individuals pregnant , breastfeeding , capable become pregnant use acceptable method birth control . Acceptable method birth control include hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , abstinence spermicide barrier . Individuals magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan demonstrate cortical atrophy proportion age . Individuals MRI scan show focal brain lesion could indicate nonidiopathic movement disorder . Individuals major comorbidity increase risk surgery prior stroke , severe hypertension , severe diabetes , need chronic anticoagulation aspirin . Individuals prior intracranial surgery . Individuals clinically active depression define accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition ( DSMIV ) criterion score validated depression assessment scale . Individuals significant cognitive impairment and/or dementia determine standardized neuropsychological battery . Individuals history seizure . Individuals immunocompromised .
