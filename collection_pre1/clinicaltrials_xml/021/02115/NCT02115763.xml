	<brief_summary>Caffeine show consistently improve time-trial performance , warrant restriction consumption regulation National Collegiate Athletics Association ( NCAA ) World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) . This ergogenic effect well understood , possibly occur result alter metabolism , improved strength , and/or reduce muscle pain . The hypothesis alter metabolism recently fall favor muscular strength tenuous relationship endurance exercise performance . Reductions muscle pain observe low moderate intensity endurance exercise , may mechanism caffeine 's ergogenic effect . In lieu reduce pain high intensity exercise , caffeine significantly improve performance . Therefore , caffeine appear improve amount work do give muscle pain rating , suggest participant may pace base upon sensation muscle pain endurance exercise . Most time-trial exercise conduct fix distance manner , measure time take participant cover give distance . Little research conduct fixed pain time-trial would require participant produce sustain give level muscle pain measure distance cover allotted time . A fixed pain time-trial could allow researcher well understand effect pain endurance performance . The purpose study examine effect caffeine fix pain time-trial .</brief_summary>
