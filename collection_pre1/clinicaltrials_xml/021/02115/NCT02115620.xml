	<brief_summary>The purpose study see telemedicine help improve health patient heart failure recently hospitalize heart problem , discharge Skilled Nursing Facility . Telemedicine use electronic communication make patient/doctor visit possible distance . This study use remote video allow heart failure specialist Providence St. Vincent Medical Center provide clinical health care patient Marquis Hills . Electronic monitor ( include electronic scale blood pressure machine ) , phone call Marquis Hill nurse staff use track patient ' health status . The nursing staff provide heart failure specialist daily update patient ' symptom , weight , vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , pulse ) , result blood test . Additionally , patient provide monitoring device include iPhone blood pressure monitor , Smart Body Analyzer use 14 day . The Smart Body Analyzer measure weight , body fat percentage , heart rate . It also measure indoor air quality . Special software iPhone save information information transmit secure email study doctor . Hypothesis : The patient follow telemedicine few visit Emergency Department , few death , few hospital re-admissions last year 's site-specific average patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical course heart failure ( HF ) highly variable , patient eventually require hospitalization manage symptomatic exacerbation . As HF progress , hospitalization become increasingly frequent overall function health decline . After acute hospitalization , many old patient discharge skilled nursing facility ( SNF ) . Patients discharge SNF HF hospitalization experience rate death re-hospitalization substantially high similar patient discharge home , even adjust patient factor . The risk worsen HF high first week hospital discharge . Close monitoring patient vulnerable period could allow early detection treatment would avert clinical deterioration need re-hospitalization ; however , patient routinely receive cardiac specialty care SNF many reason , include patient immobility , limited transportation option , under-trained staff , compete medical condition , lack timely access cardiologist . This research address issue associate heart failure use multi-faceted intervention consist provider , patient , caregiver education training , peer-to-peer telephone support SNF staff , improved access specialty care include telemedicine evaluation HF specialist , early follow-up follow SNF discharge . Specifically : Study effect telemedicine disease management intervention old patient HF ( either primary OR secondary diagnosis ) discharge SNF Providence St. Vincent Medical Center ( PSVMC ) cardiac-related admission . Multiple benefit anticipate intervention . First , close partnership staff SNF ( Marquis Hills ) Providence Heart Clinic foster . A major focus early partnership teach SNF personnel ass sign symptom HF , promote patient education self-management ( `` teach teacher '' ) , use exist HF disease management tool ( `` HF Zone tool '' ) . Second , heighten monitoring patient period great risk HF decompensation expect improve care , efficiency , patient outcome reduce cost . Earlier detection intervention mitigate worsen HF , well common complication HF therapy , kidney dysfunction electrolyte abnormality . Third , novel use telemedicine could radically alter approach chronic disease management care facility , specialty care readily available even high-risk population . Fourth , use telemedicine enable intervention scale easily SNFs clinic chronic condition . Patients discharge Marquis Hills SNF identify case management prior discharge consent enrollment study . A Heart Failure clinician , assess patient 's baseline capacity self-care HF ( Self Care Heart Failure Index , SCHFI ) , quality life ( Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire , KCCQ ) . Intake data collection SNF involve baseline assessment HF symptom basic physiologic parameter ( weight , blood pressure , heart rate ) use HF Zone tool . Certified nursing assistant provide basic education management heart failure patient family . The first business day follow SNF admission , cardiology nurse contact SNF staff review daily HF Zone tool finding follow-up laboratory test . Daily update symptom , weight , vital sign , relevant lab communicate phone cardiology nurse Providence Heart Clinic . Concerning change symptom sign trigger telemedicine clinic visit HF specialist use remote video/audio , virtual stethoscope technology , VZ Cloud manage host . Any significant change symptom ( reflect Zone tool ) vital sign communicate cardiology nursing staff HF clinician.Within 24 hour notification , telemedicine evaluation perform , allow virtual face-face interview physical examination patient HF clinician use Cisco Yabber Video , Littman e-stethoscope , Verizon manage host . Medication change , laboratory testing , additional virtual visit , in-person clinic visit arrange appropriate . The visit find become part patient 's electronic medical record communicate facility physician patient 's outpatient primary care provider . Upon discharge SNF , patient in-person cardiology follow-up clinic visit within two week discharge need , re-measurement SCHFI first follow-up visit . Subjects ' participation study last 60 day discharge skilled nursing facility . They tell result study .</detailed_description>
