	<brief_title>Fractionated Carbon Dioxide Laser Burn Scar Contractures : Evaluation Post-Treatment Scar Function Appearance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal study analyze whether fractionated carbon dioxide laser improve subjective objective quality hypertrophic and/or contract burn scar without involvement nearby mobile joint . The investigator hypothesize fractionated carbon dioxide laser therapy increase range motion improve tissue compliance scar overlie mobile joint limit due burn scar contracture . In addition , investigator evaluate effect fractionate carbon dioxide laser therapy common sequela hypertrophic and/or contract burn scar .</detailed_description>
