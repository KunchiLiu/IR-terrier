	<brief_summary>This non-blinded , placebo control , randomize , parallel phase 2 pilot study evaluate immunological response safety Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) -derived tumor antigen , Latent Membrane Protein-2 ( LMP2 ) -loaded dendritic cell ( DC ) vaccines alone co-administered TLR9 ligand , DUK-CPG-001 , patient EBV+ lymphoma set autologous stem cell transplant infusion mature T cell . Patients randomize receive vaccine alone vaccine co-administered TLR9 ligand , DUK-CPG-001 . Randomization stratify 2 disease type : Hodgkin lymphoma non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Evaluate EBV-derived Dendritic Cell Vaccine Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives The primary objective study : 1 . To assess ability Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) derive tumor antigen , LMP2 load DC vaccine co-administered Toll-like receptor 9 ( TLR9 ) ligand , DUK-CPG-001 , induce EBV derive tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cell response patient EBV+ lymphoma set autologous stem cell transplant 2 . To assess ability Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) derive tumor antigen , LMP2 load DC vaccine administer alone induce EBV derive tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cell response patient EBV+ lymphoma set autologous stem cell transplant 3 . To evaluate safety use LMP2- load DC vaccine alone co-administered TLR9 ligand , DUK-CPG-001 , patient EBV+ lymphoma set autologous stem cell transplant The secondary objective study : 1 . Evaluate duration presence long term memory cell administration LMP2 load DC vaccine alone co-administered TLR9 ligand , DUK-CPG-001 . 2 . Evaluate duration multi-functional CD8 T cell response administration LMP2 load DC vaccine alone co-administered TLR9 ligand , DUK-CPG-001 . 3 . Evaluate duration Th1 , Th2 Th17 CD4 T cell response well CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell ( Treg ) responses administration LMP2 load DC vaccine alone co-administered TLR9 ligand , DUK-CPG-001 . 4 . Evaluate disease free survival ( DFS ) patient EBV+ lymphoma set autologous stem cell transplant receive LMP2-loaded DC vaccine alone co-administered DUK-CPG-001 . Patient population Patients EBV+ lymphoma complete remission ( CR ) salvage therapy plan proceed autologous peripheral stem cell transplant . Immune response define increase number spots 25-fold baseline , least 200 spot per 105 CD8+ T cell , Day 7 post 2nd vaccination ( i.e. , patient baseline 1 spot/105 CD8+ T cell achieve 25 spots/million would count response ) . 1 . Leukapheresis # 1 : The first pheresis perform patient obtain complete remission , prior transplant . Complete remission determine base Cheson Criteria100 . No special preparative regimen require prior pheresis must occur least 2 week recent chemotherapy recent granulocytic growth factor . Pheresis last approximately 4 hour collect goal 1 x 108 nucleated cells/kg . This follow standard stem cell transplant Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) . The cell transfer John Sampson 's GMP facility ( Duke Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Processing Laboratory ) sample divide DC cell product make vaccine , T cell re-infusion transplant , research sample go Yiping Yang 's lab . As described , subsequently defrost T cell infused time autologous stem cell transplant . This follow standard stem cell transplant Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ) .Please see appendix 8.6 Cell collection : removal PBMCs leukapheresis . 2 . Leukapheresis # 2 : This standard-of-care pheresis collect cell autologous stem cell transplant perform per usual stem cell transplant pheresis SOP . Leukapheresis follow institutional norm . 3 . Stem Cell Transplant follow institutional norm . The standard minimum infusion CD34+ PBSC cell require autologous stem cell transplant 2 x 106 cd34+ cells/kg ( range 2-7 ) . The standard transplant preparative regimen use BEAM BCV . 4 . T Cell Infusion : T cell thaw infused IV autologous stem cell graft infusion complete . This infused follow stem cell transplant Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP ) re-infusion thaw transplant product ( SOP ABMT-GEN-017 ) . 5 . Post Transplant Vaccine # 1 : Nine -13 week status PBSC transplant , patient receive first post-transplant vaccination . At time vaccination , ANC must &gt; 1.5 . Delays beyond 13 week may allow discussion PI . Delays beyond 13 week decide PI case case basis allow delay due slow ANC recovery attribute medication delay non-medical reason . 6 . Post Transplant Vaccine # 2 : Four week +/- 7 day post-transplant vaccine # 1 , second Boost vaccination administer . At time vaccination ANC must &gt; 1.5 . 1 . Subjects randomize CPG arm receive CPG immediately vaccine # 1 vaccine # 2 . 7 ) Blood sample evaluation immune response collect throughout study procedure . Specifically , blood sample obtain within 7 day prior initial leukapheresis . Blood also collect prior receive vaccine # 1 # 2 day vaccine administer 2 day hand . In addition , blood drawn 7 day vaccination one , three six month second vaccination . These blood sample use analyze T cell response detailed section 3.7 . The day 7 draw must draw +/- 2 day . The one , three six month draw may occur +/- 1 week .</detailed_description>

As long EBV positive prior biopsy , EBV test required time relapse . However , EBV test perform recent biopsy negative , patient exclude . Patients must persistent , relapse , refractory disease least one prior regimen plan proceed autologous stem cell transplant Patients must complete remission time initial pheresis vaccine preparation ; complete remission determine use Cheson Criteria100 There limit number prior therapy allow Able give voluntary write informed consent Female subject either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study therapy 3 month vaccine # 2 . Male subject agree use acceptable method contraception duration study therapy 3 month vaccine # 2 . Patients must 18 year age old . ECOG performance status 02 . Exclusion Criteria An estimate measured creatinine clearance le 30 ml/min . AST , ALT , total bilirubin &gt; 3 time upper limit normal Patients chronic immunosuppressive therapy reason ( chemotherapy HL ) Chronic systemic steroid therapy dose great 10mg/day prednisone equivalent . Female subject pregnant lactating . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( betahCG ) pregnancy test result within 48 hour enrollment . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Patient receive investigational drug disease within 14 day enrollment Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study .
