	<brief_summary>Optico-chiasmatic glioma therapeutic feature since surgical resection play secondary role . Unlike site , many tumor amenable complete resection either anatomical location , sometimes biopsied . A substantial number child recurrences follow resection experience progression follow incomplete tumor removal biopsy . Celebrex Cox-2 inhibitor anti-angiogenic anti-tumor property , statin know increase sensitivity gliomas anti-tumor agent . Their association could administer long period , hope much reduce risk toxicity . This national , multicentric , interventional , open-label , non-comparative , non-randomized phase I study evaluate maximum tolerate dose Fluvastatin combination fixed-dose Celebrex . This project involve 10 SFCE health center accustom phase I / II study ( Société Française de Lutte contre les Cancers et Leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - French Society Fight Cancer Leukemia Children Adolescents ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method : total number patient number dose level test depend upon safety data occur previous level . A minimum two patient include dose level . The second patient include sufficient time assess absence dose-limiting toxicity first patient level , within 3 week treatment . The first cycle first patient must monitor propose transition next level . Dose escalation : safety data dose level review discussed transition next level . An IDMC meet end dose escalation step , decide possibility extend study 14 additional patient dose level set maximum tolerate dose .</detailed_description>
