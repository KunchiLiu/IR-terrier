	<brief_summary>Diverticulitis extremely common digestive disease particularly find large intestine elderly patient develops diverticulosis . Diverticulosis characterize formation pouch ( diverticulum ) bulge outside colon , area weakness colonic wall . Inflammation ( diverticulitis ) result one diverticulum become infected / obstruct . It commonly accompany obvious microscopic perforation , range severity single , mild , acute attack diverticulitis severe attack characterize abscess formation , occasionally result chronic complication obstruction fistula formation . After episode diverticulitis many patient develop change bowel opening , diarrhoea constipation , many patient abdominal pain symptom complex resembles Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) . According available guideline , treatment symptomatic , uncomplicated , diverticular disease aim reduce frequency severity diverticular relate symptom ( abdominal pain , bloating , alteration bowel habit ) prevent complication . Different agent propose , bulk agent , antispasmodic , nonabsorbed topical antibiotic , 5amino acid preparation measure unproven controversial . It think intestinal bacteria may play significant role symptom post-diverticulitis . The investigator recently show probiotic ( Symprove ) reduce symptom IBS significantly comparison placebo double-blind randomize trial without side effect ( paper preparation ) . Because symptoms IBS post-diverticulitis similar investigator propose double-blind placebo control trial Symprove patient problematic diverticulitis . Patients recruit dedicated diverticulitis clinic use standard exclusion criterion . This 90 day symptom base trial use accept outcome measure . If successful result widespread implication treatment diverticular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient study recruit diverticular disease clinic King 's College Hospital . The clinic first large specialist diverticular clinic UK attract referral directly GP 's , internal referral gastroenterology , outpatient increasingly Gastroenterology Colorectal Surgery clinic South East England . Eligible patient meet fulfill entry criterion invite participate . They receive patient information sheet , take home reading . They see ( usually within 2 week , confirmatory test complete ) discuss question may decision inclusion trial . Each undergo full blood count conventional biochemistry provide stool sample assessment intestinal inflammation calprotectin estimation . They also complete baseline symptoms-based questionnaire . They randomize treatment A B , investigator patient unaware whether active treatment ( Symprove ) placebo . Each patient complete symptom-based questionnaire every 30 day 90 day treatment ( Day 30 , Day 60 , Day 90 ) . The primary outcome measure change symptom score Day 0 Day 90 . Also every 30 day treatment , stool test repeat faecal calprotectin . An additional sample frozen eventual microbiota assessment . The secondary outcome measure change faecal microbiota Day 0 Day 90 . Patients see clinic 30 day cessation trial ( Day 120 ) , time patient placebo offer 90 day free treatment active ingredient wish .</detailed_description>
