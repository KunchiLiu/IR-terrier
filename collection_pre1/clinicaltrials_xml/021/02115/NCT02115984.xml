	<brief_title>Study Safety Leukostimulatory Activity Preparation `` Panagen '' Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The limited liability company Panagen design preparation name Panagen form tablet , represent fragmented nucleoprotein complex isolate human placenta . The method allow extraction full-fledged genomic DNA retention fragment tightly associate nuclear matrix protein . The length fragment DNA varies 200 6000 base pair . This trial double-blind multisite placebo-controlled sequentially randomize phase II trial involve two group patient . Totally , 80 stage II breast cancer case increase risk stage III-IV breast cancer case ( distant metastasis ) require chemotherapy participate trial . All patient sequentially randomize , , patient independently time include study may fall one two group . The patient divide two group ratio 3 : 1 ; first group receive preparation Panagen contain 60 person second one , receive placebo , 20 person . For reason ethic , size second group minimally possible obtain statistically significant data chosen . The patient subject standard chemotherapy , include 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphan , 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin , 500 mg/m2 fluorouracil ; preparation administer intravenously day . In trial , patient receive three chemotherapy course interval 3 week course ( unless interruption require ) . On background chemotherapy , patient receive preparation Panagen dose 30 mg/day placebo fractional uniform administration active day period , amount one tablet six time day ( every 2 h ) . The patient start receive preparation immediately chemotherapy take three tablet 6 h , one tablet every 2 h. Then patient stop take preparation resume administration 42 h , , 48 h chemotherapy ( day 3 ) continue administration 17 day thorough day 20 chemotherapy . If next chemotherapy course delay , patient continue take Panagen . The intake stop 1 day next chemotherapy course . It admissible delay next chemotherapy course 1 week .</detailed_description>
