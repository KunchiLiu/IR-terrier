	<brief_summary>Significance : The long term objective study improve physical therapy fitness program people spinal cord injury . The result study demonstrate importance match blood flow muscle exercise muscle . Scientific Objective : The objective study measure body regulate bloodflow muscle exercise . We intend study effect trigger blood flow change movement , measure bloodflow change exercise people spinal cord injury . We also look long term effect different exercise program bloodflow exercise . Study Populations : This study involve people partial spinal cord injury age sex match control without injury . Specific Aims : Aim 1 measure bloodflow exercise leg ( injury ) . This aim examine control bloodflow muscle contraction change spinal cord injury . Aim 2 look change bloodflow exercise training . Three different eight week exercise training program test include 1 ) upper body ergometry , 2 ) treadmill train exertion level match upper body ergometry 3 ) treadmill train heart rate match initial test upper body ergometry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sympathetic-Somatomotor Coupling Human Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The regulation cardiovascular system muscle activity poorly understood people incomplete spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . In past , disruption somatomotor sympathetic control investigate separately SCI . We propose investigate coupling sympathetic somatomotor control relevant exercise training paradigm design improve somatomotor function enhance physical fitness . Our approach measure tendon tap reflex , voluntary muscle activation , blood flow knee ( injury ) elbow ( injury ) sympathetic stimulus consist cold pressor test , mental math acute bout exercise . These data provide information sympathetic control blood flow muscle activity . Plasticity sympatheticsomatomotor couple also investigate make measurement treadmill train exercise program . These experiment enable u address three aim . Aim 1 characterize couple sympathetic somatomotor system level spinal injury . This aim examine spinal sympathetic motor reflexes interaction . It also examine descend somatomotor couple disrupt spinal injury . In Aim 2 , identify change interaction sympathetic somatomotor system spinal injury . Because injury change occur injury , sympathetic-somatomotor coupling also likely disrupt arm . Aim 3 demonstrate plasticity sympathetic-somatomotor couple exercise training . Three different eight week exercise training program test include 1 ) treadmill train exertion level match 70-80 % HRR 2 ) treadmill train 30-40 % HRR . The exercise training test randomize crossover study design one month exercise training paradigm . We anticipate plasticity sympathetic-somatomotor coupling exercise training effect normalize control system . However , injury , anticipate adaptation differ non-injured control . This study implication exercise train human SCI . The couple sympathetic somatomotor system expect depend whether exercise target upper low body . The recovery function require improvement control movement well regulation blood flow active muscle group . In addition , study important understanding potential impact treadmill exercise training cardiovascular fitness , topic increase interest people limitation physical activity .</detailed_description>
