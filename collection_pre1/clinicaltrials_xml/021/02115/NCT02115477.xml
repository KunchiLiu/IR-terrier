	<brief_summary>The purpose study - determine prevalence , size impact quality life lymphedema low extremity primary radical surgery hysterectomy +/- pelvic - paraaortic lymphadenectomy woman endometrial uterine carcinoma FIGO ( International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ) stage 1 2 - analyze risk factor development lymphedema specific group patient . Our hypothesis woman lymphadenectomy often suffer lymphedema , subjectively objectively , impaired quality life . This Swedish multicenter study carry 17 department Obstetrics Gynecology 3 department Oncology . All participant treat accord Swedish National Guidelines Endometrial Cancer . 130 woman endometrial cancer hysterectomy lymphadenectomy ( high-risk endometrial carcinoma ) 130 woman endometrial cancer hysterectomy without lymphadenectomy ( low-risk endometrial carcinoma ) prospectively enrol study . The participant examine preoperatively 3 occasion postoperatively , i.e . 4-6 week , 6 month 12 month postoperatively . Determination occurrence lymphedema low extremity determine objectively 1 ) standardize clinical evaluation accord Bruna et al . [ 1 ] 2 ) determine leg volume accord cone model Sitzia [ 2 ] systematically measure leg circumference . In addition , occurrence lymphedema measure subjectively participant . On four occasion leg circumference measurement conduct patient complete two generic health relate quality life form ( EuroQol EQ-5D Short-Form 36 SF-36 ) condition specific quality life form limb lymphedema ( LYMQOL ) . Demographic clinical data systematically collect one year postoperatively include occurrence complication give adjuvant oncological therapy chemo- radiation therapy . On occasion clinical control vaginal ultrasound examination carry order register pelvic abdominal lymphocele formation lymphatic fluid effusion intraabdominally .</brief_summary>
