	<detailed_description>Oral ingestion nitrate ( NO3- ) form nitrate salt beetroot juice show significantly low blood pressure rest also low pulmonary oxygen uptake exercise , addition improve exercise performance cycle time trial . However , consensus optimal supplementation protocol , term duration supplementation see metabolic effect . Furthermore , positive exercise performance effect nitrate ingestion primarily observe recreational athlete . The potentially ergogenic effect nitrate well-trained elite athlete therefore remain fully establish . Based gaps current literature , main goal gain insight different aspect nitrate supplementation enhance ( elite ) sport performance . This investigated study assess effect acute vs. chronic supplementation period sodium nitrate ( NaNO3- ) exercise performance .</detailed_description>
