	<brief_summary>Untreated , one third patient undergo general anesthesia postoperative nausea , vomiting , . Patients often rate postoperative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) worse postoperative pain . PONV increase risk aspiration associate suture dehiscence , esophageal rupture , subcutaneous emphysema , bilateral pneumothorax . PONV frequently delay discharge , lead cause unexpected hospital admission plan ambulatory surgery . Nabilone ( CesametÂ® ) synthetic cannabinoid develop 1970s potent CB1 agonist . The use nabilone prevent nausea vomit patient receive chemotherapy thoroughly investigate . Results clinical study demonstrate efficacy , safety , tolerability Cesamet population . There success past translate treatment chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( ie . 5-HT receptor agonist include Ondansetron Granisetron ) use perioperative environment . Only one RCT study use nabilone reduction PONV . Published 1995 , study compare administration either Cesamet 2 mg metoclopramide 10 mg give 90 minute operation patient schedule elective hysterectomy 60 woman . This study fail show significant difference group . There several limitation study include poorly optimize dose regimen , small sample size , comparison group lack clinical generalizability . This study investigate use Cesamet v Placebo , addition regular antiemetic treatment patient receive discretion manage anesthesiologist , prevention PONV . The study group include patient undergo general anesthesia elective ambulatory surgery least 3 risk factor ( &gt; 60 % risk ) development PONV .</brief_summary>
