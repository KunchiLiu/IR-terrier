	<brief_title>Exemestane With Without Entinostat Treating Patients With Recurrent Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer That Locally Advanced Metastatic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether addition entinostat endocrine therapy ( exemestane ) improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) and/or overall survival ( OS ) patient hormone receptor ( HR ) -positive , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative locally advanced metastatic breast cancer previously progress non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor ( Al ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability entinostat combination exemestane , compare safety profile endocrine therapy placebo . II . To evaluate objective response rate exemestane combination entinostat placebo . III . To evaluate whether efficacy exemestane entinostat varies change acetylation status peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . IV . To evaluate time treatment deterioration ( defined decrease health-related quality life [ HRQL ] , progression , death ) exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arm . V. To evaluate difference overall health-related quality life ( HRQL ) exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arm . VI . To evaluate difference respect specific symptom associate entinostat , i.e. , fatigue , nausea , anorexia diarrhea , exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arm . VII . To measure adherence protocol therapy . VIII . To evaluate pharmacokinetics entinostat patient advance breast cancer . IX . To evaluate , , patient variable alter pharmacokinetic profile entinostat patient advance breast cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect archival tumor sample germline deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) explore potential biomarkers therapeutic efficacy . II . To collect patient rating adverse event ( AEs ) use select patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) -Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) item evaluate psychometric property PRO-CTCAE item explore incorporation PRO-CTCAE item phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive exemestane orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 entinostat PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive exemestane Arm A placebo PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In arm , pre/perimenopausal female patient male patient also receive goserelin acetate subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
