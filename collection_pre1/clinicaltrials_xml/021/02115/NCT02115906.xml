	<detailed_description>Background : Growth hormone ( GH ) play pivotal role regulation body composition include ectopic lipid deposition insulin sensitive organ like liver skeletal muscle . Direct inhibition growth hormone action receptor antagonist show induce hepatic steatosis growth hormone replacement decrease liver fat content obese human . Of note , recent evidence indicate GH-IGF1 axis affect body composition via regulate mitochondrial oxidation capacity . Hypothesis : Direct and/or indirect effect GH mitochondrial function might mediate change body composition lipid deposition . Thus , excessive GH secretion pituitary adenoma ( Acromegaly ) might accompany increased mitochondrial activity lead inappropriately low intracellular lipid depot , especially metabolically active tissue like liver skeletal muscle . Aim : Assessment metabolic activity intracellular lipid content skeletal muscle liver patient suffer acromegaly compare control . Methods : Non-interventional study : - 31P/1H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy follow examination 3 , 6 12 month initiation GH lower treatment include surgery , somatostatinanalogs pegvisomant . - oral glucose tolerance test examination assess treatment response calculate validated parameter insulin sensitivity resistance .</detailed_description>
