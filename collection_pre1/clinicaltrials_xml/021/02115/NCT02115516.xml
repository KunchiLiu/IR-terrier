	<detailed_description>TÜCHMI-002 single center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , PfSPZ Challenge dose find trial two chemoprophylactic regimen subsequent control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) , design establish regimen PfSPZ Challenge chemoprophylaxis , PfSPZ Challenge administer IV , : 1 . Is safe well tolerate . 2 . Provides consistent sterile protection CHMI homologous sporozoite healthy adult subject . 3 . Is practical regimen PfSPZ Challenge chemoprophylaxis . Volunteers receive three immunize PfSPZ Challenge IV injection 4 week apart oral chemoprophylaxis . The trial sequential two stage : A ) In first stage , PfSPZ Challenge dose increase sequentially 3,200 51,200 PfSPZ among three group . Controls three group receive 0.9 % Sodium Chloride ( NaCl ) placebo . All volunteer receive standard chemoprophylactic regimen chloroquine ( CQ ) 10 week . Briefly , 10 mg/kg CQ base give load dose follow weekly dos 5 mg/kg CQ base . Homologous CHMI do 3,200 PfSPZ Challenge IV eight week last immunizing PfSPZ Challenge injection . B ) In Stage B , accelerate regimen CQ CQ plus ER-AZ assess . Initiation Stage B trial dependent upon demonstration least 75 % ( 6 8 ) protective efficacy homologous CHMI Stage A , PfSPZ Challenge relate SAEs approval Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) . CHMI do 3,200 PfSPZ Challenge ( NF54 ) IV ten week last immunization PfSPZ Challenge chemoprophylaxis . Injections either do 28 10 day , chemoprophylaxis give 5 week 15 day , respectively . Control group receive 0.9 % NaCl IV placebo respective chemoprophylactic regimen . Transition Stage A Stage B depend positive safety efficacy review approval independent SMC . Safety efficacy data also submit regulatory authority ( FDA U.S. Paul-Ehrlich-Institute Germany ) well Ethics Committee . Sponsor , SMC principal investigator select PfSPZ dose review safety efficacy data . In case 100 % efficacy one dose regimen comparable tolerability safety , high PfSPZ dose use . Information select dose together update volunteer information document state dose submit ethic committee approval initiation Stage B . In case PfSPZ Challenge relate SAEs occur efficacy best regimen 75 % study proceed Stage B .</detailed_description>
