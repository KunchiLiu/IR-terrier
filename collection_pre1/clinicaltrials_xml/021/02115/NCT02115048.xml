	<brief_title>Clinical Study Treatment Breast Cancer : Patient Will Receive Afatinib Plus Letrozole Letrozole Alone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , international , randomize , Phase II clinical trial ass efficacy safety letrozole combination afatinib ( oral epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor ) versus letrozole monotherapy first-line treatment postmenopausal woman ER+ , Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) negative advanced breast cancer low ER expression . In order ass level estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression use semi-quantitative scoring system ( McClelland , 1990 ) define : H-score = ( % cell stain intensity category 1x1 ) + ( % cell stain intensity category 2x2 ) + ( % cell stain intensity category 3x3 ) . This formula result H-score range 0-300 300 equal 100 % tumor cell stain strongly ( i.e. , 3+ ) . Low ER expression define tumor sample H-score 160 ( Finn , 2009 ) . All subject consent study must submit tumor sample designated central laboratory central confirmation ER / Progesterone receptor ( PR ) HER2 statuses determination H-score . This assessed prior randomization . Subjects HER2 negative , ER+ advance breast cancer low ER expression define H-score 1 159 enter screen phase perform require screening assessment . Eligible subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio stratify accord site disease ( bone disease vs. ) prior administration hormonal therapy neo/adjuvant setting ( Yes vs. No ) either : Arm A : Continuous regimen oral letrozole 2.5 mg progression disease study treatment discontinuation criterion . Arm B : Continuous regimen oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral afatinib 30 mg daily progression disease study treatment discontinuation criterion . Once subject discontinue study treatment undergone End Treatment visit , subject enter follow-up phase . A total 150 subject , 75 per arm , randomize estimated period 18 month .</detailed_description>
