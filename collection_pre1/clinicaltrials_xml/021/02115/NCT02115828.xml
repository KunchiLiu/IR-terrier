	<brief_title>A Study Vismodegib Men With Metastatic CRPC With Accessible Metastatic Lesions Tumor Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll 10 evaluable patient . Patients receive 30-day supply 150 mg vismodegib day one cycle daily mouth , begin Day 1 , continuously one follow occurs : Disease progression , intolerable toxicity probably attributable vismodegib withdrawal study . Tumor biopsy ( nodal visceral ) , skin biopsy , CTCs obtain baseline 4 week treatment . PSA evaluation conduct every 4 week , image assessment ( CT Bone scan ) conduct every 12 week routine lab ( blood count chemistry panel ) conduct every 4 week . The investigator 's intent examine fold change GLI1 expression man follow exposure drug ( compare pre-treatment on-treatment core biopsy sample ) . As secondary endpoint , investigator also explore clinical response ( PSA response , progression-free survival [ PFS ] , radiographic response ) , safety , examine change baseline Gli2 , PTCH1 , AKT1 mRNA level qRT-PCR , situ GLI1 expression tissue section mRNA situ hybridization , GLI1 expression isolate circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , accessible metastatic softtissue lesion tumor biopsy Greater 18 year age Evidence disease progression ( PSA progression , radiographic/clinical progression [ PCWG2 ] ) PSA progression define least two consecutive rise serum PSA , obtain minimum 1week interval , value ≥ 2.0 ng/mL . Radiographic progression define soft tissue lesion use RECIST criterion , i.e . increase great 20 % sum long diameter target lesion base small sum long diameter since treatment start appearance one new lesion confirmatory scan 6 week later . Radiographic progression define bone lesion appearance two new lesion confirmatory scan perform 6 week later show least 2 additional new lesion . Presence ≥1 metastatic site ( nodal , visceral ) amenable core biopsy Castrate serum testosterone ( &lt; 50 ng/dL ) Prior antiandrogens permit require ( 2 week washout antiandrogens ) Prior abiraterone enzalutamide permit ( 2 week washout agent ) Prior immunotherapy ( e.g . sipuleucelT ) , chemotherapy permit ( 4 week washout period chemotherapy ) Bisphosphonates denosumab permit , stable dose ≥4 week Life expectancy ≥12 month Adequate renal , liver , bone marrow function follow acceptable initial laboratory value : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Total bilirubin must ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Estimated creatinine clearance use CockcroftGault formula must &gt; 40 mL/minute ( See section 12.2 formula ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must ≥ 1500/μL Platelet count must ≥ 100,000/μL Willing able provide write informed consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information . NOTE : HIPAA authorization may either include informed consent obtain separately . Karnofsky Performance status/ECOG Performance Status ≥70/2 ( Appendix A : Performance Status Criteria ) Male patient must use condom time , even vasectomy , sexual intercourse female partner reproductive potential treatment vismodegib 2 month last dose avoid expose pregnant partner unborn fetus vismodegib . Current use systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 5 mg prednisone ) Known brain metastasis , untreated meningeal/dural disease Receiving investigational agent receipt another investigational agent within 4 week study entry Patients take anticoagulant history bleed diathesis ( due need visceral biopsy ) Use prohibit concomitant medication ( washout period 1 week ) Insufficient time last prior regimen radiation exposure ( washout period 4 week ) Grade &gt; 2 treatmentrelated toxicity prior therapy Any condition , opinion Investigator , would preclude participation trial</criteria>
