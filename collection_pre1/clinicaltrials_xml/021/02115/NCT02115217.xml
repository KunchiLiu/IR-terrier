	<brief_title>Effect Kinesiotaping Ankle Stability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : Compare effect kinesiotape ( KT ) sham treatment ( KT put effect ) control condition ( absence tape ) basketball player Swiss national league balance test unstable surface . Hypotheses : A KT position lateral side leg improve ankle stability basketball player balance unstable surface . Method : 30 subject recruit different basketball team affiliate Swiss national league . They perform postural stability test unstable ( `` Delos '' ) stable surface ( `` Single Les Stance '' , `` Star Excursion Balance Test '' , `` Cross Over Hop Test Distance '' ) three different condition . The three condition follow : KT position lateral side leg , sham tape without tape . The three session space time ( 7 day wash ) . The order three intervention ( KT , Sham tape , tape ) randomize ( cross ) avoid bias learn process . Neither subject examiner aware `` tape condition '' ( double blind ) ; physiotherapist charge position tape accord test condition . The sequence test subject break schedule avoid effect fatigue . An anamnesis subject do order evaluate history injury . At end session , visual analogical scale complete athlete obtain personal feeling stability . The subject also ask determine condition test . Expected result : application KT lateral side leg improve postural stability instable surface elite basketball player . Field 's importance : application KT may reduce risk ankle sprain recurrence sprain population athlete risk .</detailed_description>
