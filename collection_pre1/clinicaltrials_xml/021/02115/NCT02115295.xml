	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination cladribine , idarubicin , cytarabine help control AML , high risk MDS , and/or CML blast phase . The safety drug also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cladribine Plus Idarubicin Plus Cytarabine ( ARAC ) Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) , High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( HR MDS ) Myeloid Blast Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia ( CML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , receive treatment 2 different part : Induction Cycle Consolidation Cycles . Participant 1 cycle induction therapy first , follow 5 cycle consolidation therapy . Participant 's doctor tell many cycle . This base response participant may therapy . Each cycle 28 day . During Induction Cycle , Days 1-5 , participant receive cladribine cytarabine vein 1-2 hour . On Days 1-3 , participant receive idarubicin vein 30-60 minute . During Consolidation Cycles , Days 1-3 , participant receive cladribine cytarabine vein 1-2 hour . On Days 1-2 , participant receive idarubicin vein 30-60 minute . If disease start get good first cycle , participant may receive additional induction cycle , follow 4 consolidation cycle . Study Visits : At begin every cycle , participant physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test least 1 time week . If disease start get good , blood draw happen every 2-4 week participant take study drug . After participant 's last dose study drug , blood draw happen every 4-8 week long study . On Day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) first cycle participant bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate check status disease . Participant may another bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate later study doctor think need . During treatment , participant come clinic least 1 time week first month least 1 time month stop treatment . If study doctor think need , participant may additional clinic visit stop treatment . Length Treatment : Participant may continue take study drug 6 cycle . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study complete follow-up . Follow-Up Visits : After participant 's last dose study drug , call every 6 -12 month member study staff ask side effect may . The phone call take 5-10 minute . Participant continue call long possible . Participant continue blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test every 4-8 week study . Participant may also need additional blood draw part standard care . This investigational study . Cladribine , cytarabine , idarubicin FDA approve commercially available treatment different kind leukemia . It investigational use drug combination . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 225 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnosis AML , Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia , high risk MDS ( &gt; /= 10 % blast IPSS &gt; /= intermediate2 ) eligible . Patients CML Myeloid Blast Phase also eligible . 2 . For Frontline cohort : No prior potentiallycurative therapy leukemia . Prior therapy hydroxyurea , hematopoietic growth factor , azacytidine , decitabine , ATRA , total dose cytarabine 2g ( emergency use stabilization ) allow . Patients secondary AMLwho treat antecedent myeloid neoplasm enrol separate Secondary AML cohort . 3 . For Salvage cohort : Patients previously treat , relapse refractory AML , Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia , CML Myeloid Blast Phase eligible . 4 . Age &lt; /= 65 year . 5 . Adequate organ function define : liver function ( bilirubin &lt; /=2mg/dL , AST and/or ALT &lt; /=3 x ULN &lt; 5 x ULN related leukemic involvement ) , kidney function ( creatinine &lt; /=1.5 x ULN ) , know cardiac ejection fraction &gt; = 45 % within past 6 month 6 . ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 . 7 . A negative urine pregnancy test require within 1 week woman childbearing potential prior enrol trial . 8 . Patient must ability understand requirement study sign informed consent . A sign informed consent patient legally authorize representative require prior enrollment protocol . 1 . Pregnant woman exclude study agent use study potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapy agent , breastfeed also avoid . 2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited active uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class III IV ) , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 3 . Patient document hypersensitivity component chemotherapy program . 4 . Men woman childbearing potential practice contraception . Women childbearing potential men must agree use contraception prior study entry duration study participation .</criteria>
