	<brief_title>Physiological Intermolecular Modification Spectroscopy ( PIMS ) Ulcerative Colitis With Golimumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It widely appreciate almost proteins biological macromolecular vivo exist , least transiently , component structural functional complex . This transient interaction simple component solution study use well establish daylight light scatter ( LS ) method reflect molecular oscillation ( 7-12 ) . Protein association , protein unfolding , protein aggregation cellular crowd know affect normal function cellular system ( 13-19 ) . In many case , result small change normal protein-protein intra- intermolecular interaction think lead variety human disease ( 20 , 21 ) . Based acquire knowledge LS , cut edge technology , PIMS develop . PIMS label free technology able study protein-protein protein-solvent interaction multi-component solution . It provide individual real time dynamic fingerprint total physiological macromolecular assembly tissue presence absence exogenous molecule ( drug drug candidate , peptide protein ) . This technology base dynamic molecular resonance protein macromolecule . Cellular extract physiological condition freeze -37°C . Macromolecular spectrum register temperature within sample raise -37 37°C . This provide , within organ interest , dynamic fingerprint individual entire macromolecular assembly . The present technology therefore rapidly specifically determine response tissue cell exogenous molecule administrate . It reflect patient molecular capacity respond drug effect allow identify different subpopulation within group response specific treatment . It highlight responder non-responders give treatment .</detailed_description>
