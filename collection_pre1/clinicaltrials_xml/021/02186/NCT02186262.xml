	<brief_summary>Grading glioma significant clinical importance since prognosis well treatment choice distinct low-grade high-grade glioma . With standard MRI modality , however , reliable distinction often impossible . Moreover , gold standard glioma grade histopathology may also limitation due unrepresentative tumor sample . Therefore , advance MRI technique urgently need would high sensitivity specificity definition tumor type , grade extent . Assessment radiologic response high-grade glioma utilizes update RANO criterion 12 week completion chemoradiotherapy . However , urgent need identify nonresponding patient earlier , preferentially midtreatment order consider alternative treatment strategy . Imaging biomarkers , diffusion weight MR imaging ( DWI ) , provide promising result assess early treatment response . Furthermore , serum biomarker diagnostic value could improve tumor follow-up clinical management glioma . The aim study develop novel imaging protocol suitable magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) glioma use advanced MRI technique rotate frame imaging , novel DWI acquisition post-processing method We also study correlation advance MRI parameter histopathology tumor specimen . In addition , early treatment response assess advanced MRI parameter 3 week 10 week initiation radiotherapy . Finally , objective study association serum biomarkers correspond MRI potential tumor progression .</brief_summary>
