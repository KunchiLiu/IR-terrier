	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well chemotherapy radiation therapy give without metformin hydrochloride work treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Metformin hydrochloride may shrink tumor keep come back . It yet know whether chemotherapy radiation therapy effective give without metformin hydrochloride treat stage III non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Radiation Therapy With Without Metformin Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether metformin hydrochloride ( MET ) add chemoradiotherapy improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient locally advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect MET overall survival ( OS ) , time local-regional progression ( LRP ) , time distant metastasis ( DM ) . II . Evaluate effect MET chemoradiotherapy toxicity ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 4 [ CTCAE , v. 4 ] ) within 1 year completion treatment . III . Collect biospecimens develop biomarkers MET activity . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 undergo radiation therapy ( 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [ 3D-CRT ] intensity modulate radiation therapy [ IMRT ] ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6 week . Beginning 28-42 day completion radiation therapy , patient receive consolidation chemotherapy comprise paclitaxel IV carboplatin IV day 1 22 . Treatment consolidation chemotherapy repeat every 3 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) thrice daily ( TID ) 14 day . Beginning day 15 , patient undergo radiation therapy receive paclitaxel carboplatin Arm I , receive metformin hydrochloride BID TID 6 week . Beginning 28-42 day completion radiation therapy , patient receive consolidation chemotherapy Arm I metformin hydrochloride PO BID TID 10 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
