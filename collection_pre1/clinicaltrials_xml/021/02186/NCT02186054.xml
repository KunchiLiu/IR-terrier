	<brief_title>T2 Weighted Imaging Liver With Fast Spin Echo MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Approximately 50 patient undergoing routine liver MRI practice image one 4 clinical scanner undergo standard liver MRI protocol addition 2 breath-hold sequence ( FSE Flex eSSFSE ) increase scan time approximately 3 minute . - Data retrieve examination perform patient 's electronic imaging file store picture archive communication system ( PACS ) . - Images completely anonymized . No patient identifier available image analysis . - Analyses include visual assessment image quality , presence severity image artifact non-invasive imaging outcome perform radiologist blind patient information type sequence perform . Data present Likert type scale ( 1=poor , 2=suboptimal , 3=average , 4=above average 5=excellent ) image parameter compare use Wilcoxon sign rank test .</detailed_description>
