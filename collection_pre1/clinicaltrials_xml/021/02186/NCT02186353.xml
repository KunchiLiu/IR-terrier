	<brief_title>Processing Responses Grains ( PRO-Grains ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , investigator access feasibility generate preliminary data systematically address major question nutrition : Does food processing , specifically regard whole grain ( WGs ) , independent effect outcomes related diabetes cardiovascular disease ? Whole grain define intact , ground , crack , flake caryopsis ( kernel seed ) , principal component ( bran , endosperm , germ ) present proportion intact caryopsis . In contrast , refine grain ( RGs ) mill remove bran germ , leave endosperm result low fiber , iron , many B vitamin . Several previous study show consumption WGs vs. RGs improve insulin sensitivity decrease risk chronic disease . However , effect consume WGs may differ depend degree processing . While whole grain product contain three component kernel , hypothesize consume food contain least processed ( least pulverize ) kernel may beneficial effect metabolism decrease disease risk plausible physiological mechanism . The investigator propose partial feeding study use randomize 3-period crossover design compare effect 1 ) intact minimally process whole grain , 2 ) highly process whole grain , 3 ) refine grain , feed 4 week . The primary outcome change peripheral insulin sensitivity . Secondary outcome include hepatic insulin sensitivity , component metabolic syndrome cardiometabolic risk factor , arterial stiffness , gut microbiome fecal short chain fatty acid , rating hunger , satiation , palatability , acceptability ( gastrointestinal symptom ) .</detailed_description>
