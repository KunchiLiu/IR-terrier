	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy intravenously ( administration fluid vein ) administer golimumab 2 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) participant active ankylose spondylitis ( chronic inflammatory disease unknown etiology involve sacroiliac joint , often axial skeleton , entheses , peripheral joint ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Golimumab Participants With Active Ankylosing Spondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither researcher participant know treatment participant receiving ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance ; pretend treatment [ drug ] compare clinical trial drug test drug real effect ) study golimumab compare placebo participant active ankylose spondylitis . The study comprise 4 phase : Screening phase ( 6 week ) , Double-blind placebo-controlled phase ( Week 0 Week 16 ) , Active treatment phase ( Week 16 Week 52 ) , Safety follow-up phase ( 8 week last study drug administration ) . Total duration study 60 week per participant . Eligible Participants randomly assign either Treatment group 1 : Placebo Treatment group 2 : Golimumab . Participants randomize Placebo group , receive intravenous infusion placebo Weeks 0 , 4 12 . At Week 16 , participant receive placebo begin receive intravenous infusion golimumab ( 2 mg/kg ) Weeks 16 , 20 thereafter every 8 week Week 52 . Participants randomize Golimumab group , receive intravenous infusion golimumab 2 mg/kg Weeks 0 , 4 thereafter every 8 week Week 52 . At Week 16 , participant randomize golimumab group receive placebo infusion maintain blind . The efficacy assess primarily measure percentage participant achieve 20 percent improvement baseline assessment ankylose spondylitis ( ASAS ) Week 16 . Participant 's safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
