	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether gene mutation find urine blood lung cancer patient urine colorectal cancer patient . Gene mutation DNA gene damage way change genetic message carry gene . Gene mutation sometimes cause lung cancer . These gene mutation find lung colorectal cancer cell , normal cell body . All lung cancer tumor colorectal cancer tumor test different gene mutation presence affect lung cancer treatment . Tumor sample obtain biopsy surgery typically test gene mutation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Lung cancer : For patient participate Part A ( initial test ) Part B ( serial testing ) : Patients must diagnosis stage IV lung adenocarcinoma undergo systemic therapy . Patients must intend EGFR mutation test ( specifically include exon 19 deletion L858R ) perform tumor result available CLIA certify laboratory . â‰¥ 18 year age Specific patient participate Part B ( serial testing ) : Patients must plan receive cancer care MemorialSloan Kettering . Patients must confirm EGFR mutant lung cancer ( exon 19 deletion L858R ) molecular test result available CLIA certify laboratory . Must within 3 month diagnosis metastatic lung cancer . Treatment plan include EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor , may concurrently therapeutic protocol . Colorectal Cancer : For patient participate Part A ( initial test ) Part B ( serial testing ) : Patients must diagnosis stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma undergo systemic therapy recently progress therapy include antiEGFR base therapy . Patients must intend RAS/RAF mutation test tumor result available CLIA certify laboratory . For patient recently progress antiEGFR must tumor tissue molecular analysis preform ( prior enrolling plan test time enrollment ) . &gt; 18 year age Specific patient participate Part B ( serial testing ) : Patients must plan receive cancer care MemorialSloan Kettering . Patients must confirm RAS/RAF mutant colorectal cancer molecular test result available CLIA certify laboratory . Must within 3 month diagnosis metastatic colorectal cancer . lung cancer colorectal cancer Comorbidities would prohibit make serial urine collection difficult impossible</criteria>
