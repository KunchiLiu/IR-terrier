	<brief_summary>Shock respiratory failure common reason admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) institution . The various cause acute shock respiratory failure traditionally assess use history , physical examination , chest x-ray , EKG laboratory study . Unfortunately , much clinical information either insensitive non-specific . 1 Critical care ultrasound ( CCUS ) rapid non-invasive tool , show useful intensive care unit assist diagnosis management patient shock respiratory failure.2 The investigator hypothesize trained fellow 's interpretation critical care ultrasound image accurate compare expert ultrasound change diagnosis management patient shock respiratory failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Fellow-performed Cardiopulmonary Ultrasound Exams</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , CCUS become widely used clinician field critical care rapid non-invasive tool provide diagnostic information . At Beth Israel Medical Center , CCUS routinely use decade daily basis fellow attend aid diagnosis management shock respiratory failure . Numerous study describe accuracy speed clinician-performed critical care ultrasound . Recently show early critical care ultrasound attending modify admit diagnosis many case change management . This study do expert practitioner trainee . The accuracy fellow image interpretation proportion time fellow-performed ultrasound exam change diagnosis management study . The protocol use study already implement part diagnostic assessment critically ill patient care educational tool help fellows learn ultrasound . The goal study organize exist clinical data determine accuracy fellow interpretation along diagnostic impact fellow perform CCUS . Methods : This observational study see accurately subject ( fellow ) perform CCUS impact CCUS early diagnosis shock respiratory failure ICU . This study involve collection analysis ultrasound exam result already perform documented standard practice institution . All pulmonary critical care fellow attend GNYHA ultrasound course fellowship eligible study . Fellows also attend pre-existing monthly lecture discuss CCUS technique case . If patient evaluate study newly admit ER ultrasound assessment perform within 30 minute arrival medical intensive care unit . A fellow document initial indication ultrasound standard assessment form follow documentation much fluid patient receive since admission . Based result physical exam ancillary test fellow document pre-ultrasound diagnosis shock respiratory failure along initial assessment whether patient would respond fluid bolus administration along much fluid patient get since arrive emergency room . This initial assessment also document qpath database via ultrasound machine . They document believe diagnostic test indicate reason order well therapeutic indicate . They document assessment diagnostic impact ultrasound exam perform . A CCUS perform patient shock respiratory failure already protocol ICU . The ultrasound exam perform within 1 hour arrival ICU . All image obtain save password protect cloud database already protocol . The ultrasound require approximately 10 minute hold test therapeutic intervention . The fellow document quality image obtain pertinent finding cardiac , lung , renal , vascular abdominal exam . Following performance CCUS , fellow document post-ultrasound cause shock , respiratory failure volume responsiveness along finding . They document diagnostic therapeutic management change plan differ pre ultrasound assessment reason change diagnostic therapeutic plan . An assessment volume responsiveness use CHEETAH non-invasive cardiac output hemodynamic monitor perform directly ultrasound . This device non-invasive already used frequency MICU , SICU CCU institution provide non-invasive assessment whether patient respond fluid challenge . The result test volume responsiveness record standard assessment form . All ultrasound exam submit via database review attend expert clinician already standard practice training program . 72 hour follow admission ICU attend physician ask document final diagnosis cause shock respiratory failure . The final diagnosis compare post-ultrasound diagnosis measure degree variation . The Phillips Sparq ultrasound machine commonly use MICU . It ability save image password protect cloud database thus use study . The study investigator obtain SAF 's well 'final ' diagnosis attend physician 72hours , enter data database contain unique patient identifier . A waiver inform consent request order use patient protect health information . This appropriate since research data de-identified impact patient 's medical care .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly admit medical ICU . Clinical diagnosis shock include systolic blood pressure le 90 mmhg , patient require vasopressor indication organ hypoperfusion . Clinical diagnosis respiratory failure include need invasive noninvasive mechanical ventilation , need supplemental oxygen 50 % face mask , clinical impression respiratory failure respiratory rate great 25 . Patients shock respiratory failure base criterion . Patients shock obvious cause bleeding .</criteria>
