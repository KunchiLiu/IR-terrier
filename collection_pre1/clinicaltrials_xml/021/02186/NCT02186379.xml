Between group change score mouthfuls/min ( baseline Lab meal 1 Lab meal 2 ) assess . The investigator hypothesize child Re-Pace group great reduction rate eating ( mouthfuls food/min ) baseline week 6 , compare UCC group . As sample size relatively small , aim develop `` effect size estimation , '' i.e. , generate effect size use power extramural grant application . Specifically , investigator generate Cohen 's D effect size estimate , calculate difference group mean divide pooled standard deviation . Cohen 's D establish quantitative measure effect size estimation inform power analysis study design . In addition , study 's objective develop pilot novel family-based eating behavior program prevention intervention risk child .</detailed_description>
