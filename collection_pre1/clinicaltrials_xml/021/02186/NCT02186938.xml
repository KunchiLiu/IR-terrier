	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate whether intraoperative use FloTrac device guide fluid vasopressor management head neck free flap surgery improve postoperative outcome . Primary postoperative outcome length hospital stay . Secondary postoperative outcome include day ICU , day ventilator , presence postoperative pulmonary edema , need postoperative vasopressor transfusion , 30 day flap complication rate , inpatient postoperative cardiorespiratory complications/events , overall 30 day flap failure rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluating Use Intraoperative Stroke Volume Variation Via FloTrac Device Guide Fluid Vasopressor Management Head Neck Free Flaps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Few animal model show intravenous vasopressor administration ( include use pure alpha agonist phenylephrine ) decrease blood flow free musculocutaneous flap ( 1-3 ) . This lead dogmatic belief vasopressor avoid intraoperatively microvascular free flap reconstruction regardless patient hemodynamics , even though little publish evidence pressor negatively affect free flap outcome ( 4 ) . As result , patient often receive generous amount fluid intraoperative course combat period hypotension . However , patient receive head neck free tissue transfer tend old serious comorbidities relate long term tobacco use significant cardiovascular pulmonary disease . Thus , often exhibit intraoperative hemodynamic lability period hypotension may necessarily relate hypovolemia . Consistently treat period hypotension intravenous fluid lead serious postoperative complication graft failure ( 4 ) , pulmonary edema , congestive heart failure . In fact , complete retrospective review 248 patient 34 month period receive head neck free tissue transfer ; discover 1ml/kg/hr increase intraoperative fluid administration significantly increase 30 day flap complication rate intraoperative administration vasopressor affect 30 day flap complication 30 day failure rate . The FloTrac device approve validated medical device analyze arterial pressure waveform calculate stroke volume variation . This stroke volume variation use well guide intraoperative patient therapy regard need fluid vs. pressor management period intraoperative hypotension ( 5 ) . The use FloTrac device goal direct therapy investigated major abdominal surgery find decrease length hospital stay complication rate surgical population ( 5-6 ) . Thus , possible intraoperative use FloTrac device well guide anesthesia provider provide necessary therapy intraoperative hypotension patient undergo head neck freet tissue transfer , thus improve postoperative outcome .</detailed_description>
