	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study intensity-modulated accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) surgery treat old patient estrogen receptor positive negative progesterone receptor positive stage 0-I breast cancer . APBI specialize type radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity Modulated Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Before Surgery Treating Older Patients With Hormone Responsive Stage 0-I Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish feasibility preoperative APBI deliver intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) prone position use daily compute tomography ( CT ) guidance stage 0-I breast cancer patient intend undergo lumpectomy breast conserve therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine acute late surgical radiation toxicity preoperative APBI deliver IMRT prone position . II . To document cosmetic appearance breast treat preoperative APBI IMRT prone position . III . Establish percentage patient meet dosimetric goal normal tissue constraint treat preoperative APBI IMRT prone position . OUTLINE : Patients undergo image-guided intensity-modulated APBI twice daily ( BID ) 5 day period 5-10 day total 10 fraction . Within 4-6 week post-APBI , patient undergo lumpectomy . After completion treatment , patient follow 4 week 1 , 2 , 3 year .</detailed_description>
