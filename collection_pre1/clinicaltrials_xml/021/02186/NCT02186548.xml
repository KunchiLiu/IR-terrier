	<brief_summary>Permanent canine maxilla usually erupt mouth 11-12 year age . In approximately 2 % Swedish population fail erupt , refer impact . One severe complication impact maxillary canine damage ( root resorption ) root adjacent teeth . The root resorption may severe neighbor teeth lose . If impaction detect early ( 9-10 year age ) , recommend treatment extract deciduous canine , help permanent canine resolve unfavorable position . If improvement position canine 1 year extraction , surgical orthodontic treatment indicate . Surgical exposure follow orthodontic treatment fix appliance 2 3 year bring canine correct position . Two different main principle surgical exposure palatally impact maxillary permanent canine call close versus open surgical technique . Closed technique involve surgically uncovering canine mucoperiosteal flap dissect bone . The bone cover canine remove attachment chain bond tooth . The flap reposition suture back chain mucosa . Shortly surgery , orthodontic force apply via chain . The canine orthodontically move beneath palatal mucosa force eruption . Open technique involve surgically uncovering canine , remove window tissue around place pack cover expose area . Then treatment approach vary depend whether attachment chain bond expose tooth surgery spontaneous eruption palatally impact canine expect postsurgically . In alternative orthodontic force apply via chain canine orthodontically move mucosa . These two technique surgical exposure palatally impact canine seem two routinely use Sweden . The purpose study examine , describe compare treatment outcomes regard success duration treatment , complication , side effect , cost-benefit aspect patients´ perception close versus open surgical exposure technique , case palatally impacted canine . The objective test null hypothesis difference outcomes open close surgical exposure palatally impacted canine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods expose canine today leave personal choice surgeon orthodontist . According unpublished survey among orthodontist Sweden 2012 , 80 % use close technique , 9 % use open technique 11 % use technique . This result may compare similar survey perform UK , 29 % select closed surgical technique , 40 % select open surgical technique remainder choose combination technique . Mentioned reason preference close technique less pain need analgesic faster recovery pain , postsurgically . Some orthodontist prefer open exposure technique experience patient related pain discomfort close exposure technique , association activation orthodontically force eruption , palatally impacted canine move beyond mucoperiosteal flap . There previous study aspect , though . Factors operation time , total treatment time periodontal health measurement surgical exposure orthodontic force eruption impact canine , show heterogeneity different retrospective study . The management palatally impact canine multidisciplinary , time consume treatment , contribute relatively high society cost , study take place , try clarify issue choice method treatment . Subjects Patients diagnosis uni- bilateral palatally impact canine/-s plan surgical exposure include consecutively three orthodontic center Public Dental Health Service town Orebro , Eskilstuna Jönköping , Sweden . Procedure At appointment treatment information , orthodontist give potential study participant parent verbal write information trial . The potential study participant parent allow least one week decide whether participate trial agree participate , write consent submit orthodontic centre . After informed consent obtain , participant randomly allocate 1 2 intervention . A computer generate randomization undertaken ensure equal number allocate intervention . Allocation concealment hold one individual per centre , involve trial , contact consent clinician patient go referred surgical exposure . There stratification age gender two different group . If maxillary deciduous canine present ; remove time surgical exposure . The two different surgical exposure technique describe `` Intervention arm '' . The patient give verbal write postsurgical information . Verbal pre-/postsurgical information consist recommendation : - Analgetic ( paracetamol first choice ) 1 hour surgery every 6 8th hour 2 day post surgically , accord dosage recommend - Tooth paste without sodium recommend use directly association chlorhexidine rinse Together write postsurgical information , questionnaire hand surgical clinic patient , assessment experience pain discomfort even day surgical exposure one week . The postsurgical questionnaire contains question validate . This questionnaire submit orthodontic centre first postsurgical control . After surgical exposure orthodontic force apply ; close technique group later 2 week post surgically open technique group bond attachment possible . In surgical exposure group orthodontic force apply palatally impacted canine via chain attach bond attachment canine , fix orthodontic appliance . Questionnaires hand patient every 3rd month orthodontic clinic , evaluate patients´ perception pain discomfort , impacted canine orthodontically position dental arch . These questionnaire submit orthodontic clinic day , association orthodontic appointment . Questionnaire ass patients´ perception dental anxiety hand patient treatment , impacted canine erupt active treatment finish surgical exposure group , orthodontic centre . Dental anxiety evaluate described accord Cuthbert MI Melamed BG . The patient follow active orthodontic treatment finish orthodontic retainer fit .
