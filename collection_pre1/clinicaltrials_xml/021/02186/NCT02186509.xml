	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose alisertib combine fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery treat patient high-grade glioma return previous treatment radiation therapy ( recurrent ) . Alisertib may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need cell divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Stereotactic radiosurgery use special position equipment send single high dose radiation directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Delivering stereotactic radiosurgery multiple dos ( fractionation ) may cause damage tumor tissue normal tissue maintain advantage accuracy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib Fractionated Stereotactic Radiosurgery Treating Patients With Recurrent High Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability study treatment . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) daily oral alisertib combine fractionate stereotactic radiation treatment recurrent high grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate 6 month progression free survival rate . II . To estimate median time progression . III . To estimate overall survival . IV . To estimate impact quality life ( QoL ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study alisertib . CONCURRENT PHASE : Patients undergo fractionate stereotactic radiosurgery daily ( QD ) every weekday 10 day receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) concurrently radiation therapy 10 day . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive alisertib PO BID day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 4-6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must previously histologically cytologically confirm high grade glioma ( astrocytic oligodendroglial supratentorial tumor grade 3 4 ) previously treat fractionate radiation therapy show evidence recurrence . 2 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy . 3 . Patients must recover effect surgery . There must minimum 21 day day surgery day protocol treatment . For core needle biopsy , minimum 7 day must elapse prior day protocol treatment . 4 . Prior treatment cytotoxic biological agent permissible . There least 2week break prior treatment protocol treatment . 5 . Prior treatment fractionate radiation therapy ( 60Gy ) eligibility criterion , however second course fractionate radiotherapy supratentorial area . 6 .

Women childbearing potential must negative βHCG pregnancy test document within 7 day prior registration . 15 . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry 4 month last dose . 16 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 1 . Known history uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome condition could result excessive daytime sleepiness severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require supplemental oxygen . 2 . Systemic infection require IV antibiotic therapy within 14 day precede first dose study drug , severe infection . 3 . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . 4 . Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . 5 . Patient receive investigational drug within 14 day enrollment 6 . Serious medical psychiatric illness likely interfere participation clinical study . 7 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition , include uncontrolled diabetes , malabsorption , resection pancreas upper small bowel , requirement pancreatic enzyme , condition would modify small bowel absorption oral medication , laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate enrollment study . 8 .
