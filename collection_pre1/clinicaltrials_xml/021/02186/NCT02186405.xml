	<detailed_description>Animal experimental hypothyroidism associate renal hemodynamic abnormality . In human , exact measurement GFR show decline GFR thyroidectomy increase GFR renal blood flow hormone replacement . Renal cardiovascular effect subclinical hypothyroidism , define high TSH normal T4 le known indication treatment subclinical hypothyroidism subject controversy . A retrospective study suggest treatment subclinical hypothyroidism may slow degradation rate renal function estimate MDRD . However , potential hemodynamic benefit treatment yet study . The investigator propose ass whether hormone replacement subclinical hypothyroidism patient chronic kidney disease beneficial hemodynamic renal function mechanism involve . Isotopic measurement glomerular filtration renal blood flow hemodynamic evaluation transthoracic echocardiography flow-mediated vasodilation carry 6 month substitution . This open prospective study include 16 patient order detect increase 1.2 standard deviation measure glomerular filtration .</detailed_description>
