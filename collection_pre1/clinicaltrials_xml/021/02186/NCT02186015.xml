	<brief_summary>Background : Several clinical trial underway investigate variable form vitamin D ( D2 vs. D3 ) prescribe different dos ( 10,000-50,000 IUs/week ) improve side-effects associate treatment estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer , specifically aromatase inhibitor ( AIs . ) Presumably generalizability potential safety purpose , trial predominantly exclude woman metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) ; rapidly expand sector cancer survivor population experience significant treatment-related side-effects . Evaluation safety vitamin D3 supplementation crucial since supplementation lead high calcium importantly , lab study show vitamin D3 affect gene increase estrogen production . To assure vitamin D3 affect clinical effect anti-estrogen therapy , effect vitamin D3 supplement estrogen production require evaluation explores define potential role symptom management population . Objectives : This pilot study evaluate feasibility vitamin D3 supplementation woman MBC , provide much need data preliminary safety efficacy treatment patient population . This study determine : 1 ) weekly supplementation high dose vitamin D3 increase serum vitamin D level without adverse effect relate therapy ( primary aim ) ; 2 ) effect vitamin D3 supplementation symptom management ( secondary aim ) ; 3 ) vitamin D3 supplementation associate improved inflammation ( exploratory aim . ) Methods : This 8 week `` proof concept '' study monitor important laboratory parameter assess potential effect short-term outcome . Adult , female patient ( &gt; =18 year ) ER+ MBC ( Stage IV ) race/ethnicity history vitamin D &lt; 30 mg/dl recruit within around LUMC . Following current clinical practice guideline , eligible participant receive 50,000 IUs vitamin D3 weekly 8 week . Laboratory value , muscle function inflammation examine pre- post-supplementation , symptom ( e.g. , pain , sleep , fatigue , mood , overall quality life ) assess baseline , 4 8 week post-supplementation . We assess increase vitamin D associate clinically significant change serum estradiol , improvement symptom QOL , decrease inflammation , control sunlight exposure , diet , physical activity body composition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Aims Several clinical trial underway investigate vitamin D2 D3 provide various dos ( 10,000-50,000 IUs/week ) improve side-effects associate anti-estrogen therapy , specifically aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) . However , current trial use variable form vitamin D predominantly include woman Stage I-III disease , exclude woman metastatic breast cancer . Evaluation safety vitamin D3 supplementation crucial since supplementation lead hypercalcemia importantly , vitro study show vitamin D3 influence transcription gene increase estrogen production.27,28 To assure vitamin D3 abrogate clinical effect anti-estrogen therapy , effect vitamin D3 supplementation estrogen production require evaluation . Therefore , overarch goal pilot study evaluate safety , feasibility efficacy vitamin D3 supplementation woman MBC . We address test follow aim hypothesis , respectively : Aim 1 : To determine weekly supplementation 50,000 IUs vitamin D3 raise serum level 25 ( OH ) D &gt; 30 mg/dl without adverse effect . Hypothesis 1 : Women compliant vitamin D3 supplementation , evidence normalization ( &gt; 30 mg/dl ) increase serum 25 ( OH ) D level , experience significant change serum calcium , parathyroid hormone serum estradiol level . Aim 2 : To determine effect vitamin D3 supplementation symptom management . Hypothesis 2 : Women achieve serum concentration 25 ( OH ) D ≥30 mg/dl experience significant increase 25 ( OH ) D exhibit improvement pain , fatigue , sleep , mood , muscle function overall quality life . Exploratory Aim : To explore mechanistic effect vitamin D3 supplementation inflammatory marker potential association symptom management . Summary : Evidence study involve early stage breast cancer participant confirm musculoskeletal pain , endocrine relate symptom mood disturbance commonly associate breast cancer treatment , particularly hormone deprivation therapy . The high prevalence vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency among breast cancer survivor well accept hypothesized aggravate treatment-related side effect , particularly arthralgias . Women MBC exclude majority on-going vitamin D supplementation trial safety generalizability purpose . However , novel therapy continue improve prolong life woman , result rapidly expansive group breast cancer survivor . While vitamin D supplementation prescribe correct underlying nutrient deficiency clinical context preserve bone health , emerge evidence suggests may systemic effect . Thus , vitamin D repletion/supplementation profound potential implication woman MBC , whose primary goal treatment minimize side-effects treatment support optimal quality life . This study reflect highly innovative , yet simple therapy could ultimately provide survivor much need evidence-based supportive care strategy .</detailed_description>
