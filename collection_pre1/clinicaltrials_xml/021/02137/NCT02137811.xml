	<brief_summary>Recently automate test measure cancer cell death presence chemotherapy develop . This test call MiCK assay ten year development phase call Correct Chemo . CorrectChemo provide medical community patient way determine effect different chemotherapy individual cancer cell . MiCK assay proven clinical usefulness two study . In one study use multiple type cancer , physician use MiCK assay 63 % patient . If physician use result prescribe chemotherapy treatment , patient ' response rate , time disease get bad , overall survival significantly well compare patient whose physician use result . In another study breast cancer patient , physician use MiCK assay 74 % patient . If result use plan chemotherapy , response rate time disease start get worse significantly well compare patient whose physician use result MiCK assay The purpose study compare outcomes patient MiCK assay ( CorrectChemo ) tumor type , physician attitude towards test , physician use test . This study gather data review medical chart .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Demographics , Clinical Outcomes , Physician Attitudes Patients Who Have Received The MiCK Assay ( CorrectChemo )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study correlate clinical outcome patient MICK assay tumor type , physician attitude towards assay , physician use assay use data patient chart , survey physician attitude . Study Objectives : 1 . To determine often physicians use MiCK assay result develop treatment plan , drug physician use treatment . This correlated patient tumor demographic . 2 . To determine physician attitude towards MiCK assay . 3 . To determine clinical outcome ( response rate , time progression , overall survival ) patient MiCK assay . This correlated pattern physician use assay . Treatment Plan : 1 . The treat oncologist provide demographic information ( patient identifying number , sex , age , number prior line therapy , performance status ) tumor information ( cell type , stage , metastatic site , goal therapy , pre-assay plan therapy , post-assay therapy chosen 2 . Tumor response , patient symptom response , time progression chemotherapy regimen , overall survival determine patient chart correlate MICK assay result . 3 . Physicians complete questionnaire attitude towards usefulness assay . Statistics 1 . Investigators correlate tumor response , symptom response , time progression overall survival drug therapy drug response MICK assay first chemo regimen assay , accord pattern physician use assay . 2 . We accumulate physician attitude toward usefulness assay . Informed Consent Since study risk patient , inform consent need . Physicians option participate , participate , patient . Physicians compensate complete chart review submit data MiCK assay perform , 6,12 24 month MiCK assay . Data Collection Physicians Data include demographic tumor characteristic physician attitude : I use test develop treatment plan yes/no , I find test useful yes/no , I find test helpful plan palliative care yes/no , I find test helpful plan hospice yes/no . I suggestions improvement ( free text response ) . Data include 6,12 24 month clinical outcome judge physician : Complete , Partial , Stable , Death , symptomatic improvement patient felt well worse . Data include time progression , doctor use MiCK assay plan next treatment , try get another MiCK assay , use assay plan palliative care hospice .</detailed_description>
