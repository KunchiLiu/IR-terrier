	<brief_summary>Naltrexone drug block effect chemical call beta-endorphins make body . Beta-endorphins make response stress , injury , also pleasurable activity . In previous study , show level beta-endorphins blood go radiation therapy , increase link fatigue . This suggest naltrexone may help reduce fatigue people get radiation therapy In research study , investigator look see whether naltrexone work well placebo reduce fatigue radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naltrexone RCT Treatment-Emergent Fatigue Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial two phase ( monitor intervention phase ) . Monitoring Phase : Prior start radiotherapy non-metastatic breast cancer , participant approach consented monitoring phase study , involve longitudinal monitoring fatigue order establish whether patient develops fatigue start radiation . The level pre-radiotherapy fatigue obtain final two week radiotherapy start . All participant undergo weekly monitoring fatigue via brief self-report questionnaire . The monitoring period continue one month conclusion radiotherapy . Those whose fatigue symptoms increase pre-specified threshold point monitoring period approach enrollment intervention phase study . Intervention Phase : This randomize , double-blind , parallel-arm 5-week clinical trial use determine effect naltrexone fatigue emerge radiation therapy non-metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Eligibility Criteria Monitoring Phase Age ≥ 18 Diagnosis : invasive breast cancer ( stage IIII ) , ductal carcinoma situ , lobular carcinoma situ , lobular carcinoma Plan receive radiation therapy Eligibility Criteria Randomization Phase Participants may prior breast surgery and/or chemotherapy . Age ≥18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use naltrexone cancer patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study , eligible future pediatric trial . Participants must acceptable pretreatment laboratory value define : total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal . If childbearing potential , willingness use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Receiving radiation therapy type DFCI , BWH , MGH ( include limit partial breast irradiation , twofield , threefield , fourfield plan ) FACITF subscale score &gt; =10 preradiation therapy decrease FACITF 10 point compare preradiotherapy baseline Exclusion Criteria Monitoring Phase Suicidal ideation , determine via PHQ9 NonEnglish speak Exclusion Criteria Randomization Phase Participants major depressive disorder and/or suicidal ideation determine PHQ9 . Participants receive investigational agent might interact study medication influence measurement study outcome . Participants know metastatic disease exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition naltrexone . Participants use opioidcontaining medication ( include cough/cold medication contain codeine and/or antidiarrheal contain loperamide ) past 2 week , expect require opioidcontaining medication within duration treatment period . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study naltrexone category C agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother naltrexone , breastfeed discontinue mother treated naltrexone . Participants use contraindicated medication ( thioridazine , yohimbine )</criteria>
