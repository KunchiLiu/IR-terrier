	<brief_summary>The purpose study twofold . First , determine whether vancomycin effective early treatment Biliary Atresia ( BA ) Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) , , mechanism . Secondly , characterize human intestinal microbial community interaction host .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Biliary Atresia With Vancomycin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators hope learn characterize human intestinal microbial community ( microbiome : collection collectivity microorganism ) use molecular method , examine mechanisms interaction host microbiome use genomic approach , determine microbiome preserve local health promotes pathology . Investigation focus primary sclerosing cholangitis , biliary atresia , well state health . The composition associate microbiome assess base ribosomal DNA RNA sequence , attention give richness ( diversity ) , evenness ( relative abundance ) , variation respect time , person , anatomic niche . Host response adjacent mucosal surface assess base genome-wide gene expression pattern . In addition , change metabolite blood analyze . To see antibiotic vancomycin , use early treatment Biliary Atresia ( BA ) Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) effective treatment disease . Investigators hope learn effect Vancomycin bacteria present stool , body fluid intestinal tissue someone BA PSC mechanism .</detailed_description>
