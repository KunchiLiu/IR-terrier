	<brief_summary>The primary purpose pilot randomize control trial provide preliminary indicator effect continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion continuous glucose monitoring compare self-monitoring blood glucose alone : ( 1 ) metabolic control ( 2 ) fear hypoglycemia . Additional objective : ( 1 ) provide estimate recruitment rate , ( 2 ) ass compliance allocate treatment , ( 3 ) determine participant ' satisfaction allocate treatment . With increased immediate information relate current future ( trend ) glucose information provide continuous glucose monitor , child act upon knowledge prevent hypo- hyperglycemia , thus , experience reduction glucose variability , lead improvement metabolic control show reduction HbA1c level . Research effectiveness continuous glucose monitor metabolic control child T1D use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion limit . Therefore , pilot clinical trial design provide preliminary indicator feasibility acceptability continuous glucose monitor metabolic control address follow objective .</brief_summary>
