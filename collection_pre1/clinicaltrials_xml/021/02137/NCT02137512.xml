	<brief_summary>The purpose study see automate insulin management system ( `` study system '' ) safely use home manage blood sugar . The study system include ( 1 ) CGM measure glucose level , ( 2 ) computer program smartphone determine much insulin need allows study participant user control whole system , ( 3 ) insulin pump delivers insulin . The CGM Dexcom . The pump Roche . The CGM pump similar device currently available people purchase use . However , smartphone device , CGM sensor type use , overall study system use research time . The study complete 24 individual 6 center United States Europe . This study several phase take 11-14 week complete depend whether study participant CGM user . At select site ( base subject eligibility availability ) , approximately 10-20 subject exhibit safe competent use system home give option continue home use system Day-and-Night Closed-Loop mode 5 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study phase follow : - Screening visit see eligible study determine long need use study CGM ( visit 1 ) - Up 3 week use study CGM ( depend current CGM use ) , follow office visit ( visit 2 ) - 2 week use study insulin pump study CGM together - Full day visit clinic hotel train use system ( visit 3 ) - 1 week use system without automated insulin delivery suspension - 2-day hotel clinic visit closed-loop training ( visit 4 ) , - 16-19 day use system even overnight follow office visit ( visit 5 ) - 16-19 day use system full 24 hour - Final study clinic visit ( visit 6 ) - Option 5 month extension phase day-and-night closed-loop home use</detailed_description>
