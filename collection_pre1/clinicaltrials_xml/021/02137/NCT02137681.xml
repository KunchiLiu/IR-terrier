	<brief_title>A Multicentre Investigation 2 Cycles Rituximab Compared With Standard Regimen Management Steroid-Resistant/Relapsed Immune Thrombocytopenia （ITP）</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicentre , randomise control trial 60 refractory ITP adult patient medical center China . One part participant randomly select receive rituximab ( give intravenously dose 375mg/m ( 2 ) weekly 2 week , i.e . Day 1 , 8 ; others select receive standard rituximab treatment ( give intravenously dose 375 mg/m ( 2 ) weekly 4 cycle , i.e . Day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ) . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Adverse event also record throughout study . In order report efficacy safety combination therapy compare conventional rituximab therapy treatment adult steroid-resistant/relapsed immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) .</detailed_description>
