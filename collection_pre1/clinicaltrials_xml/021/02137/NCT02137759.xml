	<brief_summary>In first phase study ( Cohort 1 ) , investigator determine feasibility add MRSI evaluation newly-diagnosed GBM patient treat standard RT/TMZ determine whether magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) predict good outcome patient . In second phase study ( Cohorts 2a 2b ) , investigator find maximum tolerate dose belinostat treat newly-diagnosed GBM patient standard RT/TMZ determine whether MRSI aid clinician early determination response new therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRSI Predict Response RT/TMZ ± Belinostat GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients assign Cohort 1 ( standard RT/TMZ ) follow entry either Cohort 1 Cohort 2a ( standard RT/TMZ + dose find belinostat ) , follow assignment Cohort 2b ( standard RT/TMZ + tolerable dose belinostat ) . Patients undergo MRSI scan begin treatment several time point treatment look early response tumor treatment . Blood tumor sample use measure level certain marker within cancer cell . Patients also assess side effect experience . Progression-free overall survival outcome record . Patients also assessment depressive symptom , quality-of-life neurocognitive function several time point therapy course .</detailed_description>
