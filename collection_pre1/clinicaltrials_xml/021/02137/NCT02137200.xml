B3 . Inclusion exclusion criteria The investigator use broad inclusion criterion ensure generalizability result . Exclusion criterion limit condition vaginal delivery contraindicate expedited delivery require . B4 . Outcome Measures B4-1 . Primary aim Primary outcome measure : The primary outcome spontaneous vaginal delivery , define delivery occur without use forceps , vacuum , cesarean , primary outcome measure . This spontaneous vaginal delivery desirable outcome labor woman second stage labor . Compared cesarean delivery , spontaneous vaginal delivery associate low maternal neonatal morbidity , include hemorrhage , postoperative wound infection , endometritis , prolonged hospitalization . Further , cesarean perform , risk delivery cesarean future pregnancy dramatically elevate , increase maternal morbidity . Finally , although operative vaginal delivery associate overall low maternal morbidity cesarean delivery , carry high risk neonatal maternal pelvic floor injury spontaneous vaginal delivery . Secondary outcome measure : Operative vaginal delivery ( forceps vacuum ) , cesarean delivery , total duration second stage , duration active push , postpartum hemorrhage , endometritis . B4-2 . Secondary aim # 1 Outcome measure : The outcome measure aim neonatal composite morbidity , define occurrence morbidity : - Neonatal death - Major neonatal injury - Acidemia - Respiratory distress - Transient tachypnea - Meconium aspiration pulmonary hypertension - Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy - Hypoglycemia - Suspected sepsis B4-3 . Secondary aim # 2 Outcome measure 1 . Rate extent acute levator ani muscle ( LAM ) injury nulliparous woman . i.Overt LAM injury , define clinically diagnosed 2nd , 3rd , 4th degree perineal laceration . ii.Occult LAM injury , define interruption LAM 3D transperineal ultrasound ) injury nulliparous woman . 2 . Rates extent sign POP objective clinical examination 4 - 8 week , 5 - 7 month postpartum follow-up visit use validated Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification ( POP-Q ) system . 3 . Rates patient-reported symptom urinary incontinence ( UI ) , fecal incontinence ( FI ) , pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) validate quality-of-life questionnaire 1 - 5 day , 4 - 8 week , 5 - 7 month postpartum . C. STUDY PROCEDURES C1 . Recruitment The investigator employ familiar efficient recruitment technique use recent randomized trial setting . All woman admit labor delivery unit participate medical center screen inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible subject approach write consent participate study commit vaginal delivery attempt . Although consent participate obtain irrespective cervical dilation , randomization perform complete cervical dilation confirm . This necessary avoid situation subject randomize subsequently undergo cesarean delivery first stage labor indication failure progress non-reassuring fetal heart trace . C2 . Randomization Enrolled subject randomly assign 1:1 ratio immediate delay push . A web-based randomization sequence prepare use block variable size , stratify study site , maintain centrally study statistician . The advantage method provide good probability balance , future assignment unpredictable . In addition , allow explicit randomization analysis conduct relative ease . Stratification center assure balance two treatment group within center account possible difference patient management . A subject 's group assignment obtain subject confirm continue meet inclusion criterion , study number 10-cm cervical dilation enter locked secure web site upon complete cervical dilation . C3 . Blinding Although blind subject physician would ideal , blind clearly possible trial . We minimize systematic bias apply standard procedure manage labor delivery patient . Further , group assignment subject take account research personnel collect neonatal maternal outcome maternal pelvic floor morbidity . Importantly , primary outcome spontaneous vaginal delivery objective measure . C4 . Interventions Interventions compare trial two common approach initiate maternal push second stage labor : 1 . Immediate push : Women group instruct initiate push soon complete cervical dilation document . Maternal position , technique ( close open glottis ) , duration frequency maternal push effort discretion subject 's nurse physician . 2 . Delayed push : Women assign delayed push group instruct wait 60 minute complete cervical dilation push . Women allow push earlier feel irresistible urge push clinical indication initiate push . We choose 60 minute delay time meta-analysis suggest duration delay ( range 60 180 minute ) modify effect delay push spontaneous vaginal delivery rate . Additionally , 60-minute delay enable u assess effect delay push without unduly increase total duration second stage . This important , although establish threshold , number large cohort study suggest incremental increase risk operative delivery , maternal infection , hemorrhage , laceration , well neonatal Apgar score depression , worsen cord pH , neonatal morbidity , additional hour second stage , regardless whether patient push immediately delay push . Finally , patient indicate survey would prefer wait longer 60 minute complete cervical dilation push randomize delayed push group . C5 . Pelvic Floor Assessment These assessment oversee Co-I Dr. Richter , Urogynecologist site UAB PI NIH-funded Pelvic Floor Disorders Research Network . Patients willing participate pelvic floor assessment part study consent . C5-1 . Postpartum three-dimensional transperineal ultrasound image Traditionally , MRI use detect LAM injury , investigator recently validate use 3D ultrasound assess acute LAM injury . We use ultrasound much readily available inexpensive tool MRI . Subjects enrol WUMC , UAB OHSU ask consent pelvic floor assessment include postpartum 3D transperineal ultrasound examination . Examinations follow method develop validated Dietz Simpson . Dr. Shobeiri undertake image processing interpretation . Drs . Shobeiri Lockhart , well trained personnel , blind group assignment subject . C5-2 . Assessment pelvic floor morbidity The investigator conduct comprehensive assessment pelvic floor include component outlined proceeding NIH Terminology Workshop Research Pelvic Floor Disorders . These assessment oversee Co-I Dr. Richter , Urogynecologist site PI NIH-funded Pelvic Floor Disorders Research Network extensive experience use instrument pelvic floor research . 1 . POP-Q stag pelvic organ prolapse ( 4 - 8 week , 5 - 7 month postpartum ) : Objective assessment pelvic organ prolapse base POP-Q system , objective , site-specific system describing , quantify , stag pelvic support woman . We follow standard guideline establish International Continence Society . Pelvic examination perform dorsal lithotomy position subject strain maximally . 2 . Symptom Quality-of-Life Questionnaires ( 1-5 day , 4 - 8 week , 5 - 7 month postpartum ) : We use four validated Symptom Quality-of-Life Questionnaires assess subjective symptom pelvic floor morbidity : Fecal Incontinence Severity Index ( FISI ) , Modified Manchester Questionnaire , Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 , Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-7 ( PFIQ-7 ) . D. DATA MANAGEMENT D1 . Data Collection The investigator collect extensive antepartum , intrapartum , postpartum information participant infant . Data collect standardized form nearly response precoded . D2 . Data Management The study statistician ( Dr. Liu ) data manager ( Mr. Colvin ) WUSM responsible coordinate overall data management . Data collect manage REDcap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) , establish , secure , web-based data capture management tool develop Vanderbilt University support Division Biostatistics WUSM ( http : //www.biostat.wustl.edu/redcap/ ) . The database back periodically throughout day back offsite nightly . assessment . Data cleaning perform prior quarterly report . E. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS E1 . Sample size Power E1-1 . Total sample size trial : The sample size trial estimate base primary outcome . The investigator estimate , basis sample size primary aim , power detect clinically significant difference secondary outcome . All sample size power estimate base two-tailed test . This important power detect increase decrease outcomes immediate compare delayed push . The baseline spontaneous vaginal delivery rate delay push used sample size estimation base observational cohort . We estimate total 3184 ( 1592 delayed 1592 immediate push ) sufficient detect 5 % absolute difference ( estimate 72 % versus 77 % ) spontaneous vaginal delivery 90 % power ( alpha 0.05 ) . E1-2 . Estimated power secondary aim # 1 : The sample size 3184 primary outcome sufficient detect 2 % absolute difference neonatal composite morbidity two group &gt; 80 % power significance level 5 % . This represent difference 6 % neonatal composite morbidity rate delay ( base observational cohort study ) 4 % immediate push . E1-3 . Estimated power secondary aim # 2 : We anticipate least 630 consent complete pelvic floor aspect study . This provide adequate power key outcome secondary aim # 2 . The rate POP ( define POP hymen ) FI ( base FISI ) nulliparous woman 6 - 12 month postpartum prior study 20.2 % [ 38 ] 12.6 % [ 38 , 39 ] , respectively . Using baseline , 630 woman provide &gt; 80 % power detect 40 % difference rate pelvic organ prolapse fecal incontinence two group . For LAM injury postpartum 3D transperineal ultrasound examination , prior study find average rate 38 % [ 40 ] . Using baseline rate , 630 woman provide &gt; 90 % power detect least 30 % difference occult LAM injury . For overt anal sphincter injury , sample size sufficient detect 40 % difference 2nd , 3rd , 4th perineal laceration ( anticipated 27 % 16.2 % &gt; 80 % power ) . E2 . Interim Analyses The investigator anticipate two interim analysis 50 % 75 % sample size recruit , exact time discretion DSMB . Analyses perform study statistician present DSMB , make recommendation regard conduct trial . At first meeting , DSMB establish threshold rule trial stoppage base safety efficacy limit . Although early stopping decision base purely mathematical stopping rule , Haybittle-Peto stopping rule use guide . Under rule , interim analysis primary outcome would demonstrate extreme difference group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) justify premature disclosure . This rule advantage exact number time interim analysis need specify advance overall type I error preserve 0.05 . Therefore , sample size adjustment need . E3 . Data Analysis Plan E3-1 . Overview Data analysis adhere closely CONSORT guideline . Analyses follow intention-to-treat principle subject analyze group randomize , regardless whether receive assigned intervention . E3-2 . Primary Analysis Descriptive statistic characterize group individual recruit investigate comparability two group baseline . Formal statistical test limited select baseline characteristic consider prognostic factor primary outcome , fetal station complete cervical dilation , birth weight , duration first stage labor . The categorical prognostic factor compare trial group use Chi-squared Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Distributions continuous prognostic factor assess visual inspection histogram Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . The two-group independent t-test use compare normally distribute variable . If variable normally distribute , Mann-Whitney U test use make comparison trial group . The analysis primary secondary outcome control study site , consider randomization stratify study site . The primary outcome ( spontaneous vaginal delivery ) categorical secondary outcome compare trial group use Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test . The estimate common relative risk confidence interval associate primary secondary outcome calculate . The Breslow-Day test homogeneity odds ratio report well . Distributions continuous secondary outcome measure duration second stage labor within site assess visual inspection histogram Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . The mixed model study site treat fixed effect use compare normally distribute variable . If variable normally distribute , van Elteren test use make comparison trial group . E3-3 . Secondary Analyses The investigator perform analysis aim obtain adjusted assessment treatment effectiveness , adjust baseline patient characteristic ( covariates ) . The objective analysis estimate influence covariates outcome use covariates improve estimate difference treatment group . The stepwise logistic regression model stratify study site use identify estimate effect multiple prognostic factor probability spontaneous vaginal delivery categorical outcome . For continuous secondary outcome duration second stage , mixed model study site treat fixed effect consider adjust prognostic factor . Interaction test use determine whether effectiveness push strategy significantly differ across subgroup . These analysis consider exploratory nature view provide confirmatory test hypothesis . The following prespecified stratify secondary analysis conduct : 1 . Study site 2 . Fetal station complete cervical dilation ( high versus low ) 3 . Fetal position complete cervical dilation ( occiput-anterior , occiput-posterior 4 . Duration delay prior push 5 . Maternal age 6 . Maternal Race 7 .
