	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bifurcation lesion prone occur worsen atherosclerosis . Their structural property make angioplasty technique increase difficulty implementation , also increase risk in-stent thrombosis restenosis . Standard treatment coronary bifurcation lesion remain controversial manner , especially side branch ( SB ) large combine high angulate bifurcation lesion . Complex procedure certain type lesion associate poor prognosis . There standard treatment lesion even development drug-eluting stent solve partial problem . The investigator review patient receive coronary intervention 2009-2012 year meet inclusion criterion , analyze prognostic relevance case use different treatment modality .</brief_summary>
