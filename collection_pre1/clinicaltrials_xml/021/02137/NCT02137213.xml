	<brief_summary>At least 30 % patient receive methadone maintenance therapy ( MMT ) suffer constipation often affect effectiveness MMT increase impact health care system . Existing treatment include several over-the-counter medication target pathobiological basis opioid-induced constipation limit effectiveness . At time well-known medication , naloxone , already show help constipation patient receive methadone chronic pain , never try patient receive methadone opioid dependence . This study aim try naloxone treatment opioid-induced constipation MMT setting . The investigator enroll 20 patient receive MMT suffer opioid-induced constipation . The study crossover design - patient receive one week regular methadone dose one week regular methadone dose naloxone add . Normal saline add methadone-only formulation placebo . Order week choose randomly . Both subject investigator blind study condition ( i.e . whether naloxone normal saline add methadone preparation give week ) . Primary hypothesis : Patients receive combination oral methadone/naloxone ratio 50:1 less severe symptom constipation compare receive methadone . Secondary hypothesis : Addition oral naloxone methadone ratio 50:1 cause clinically significant opioid withdrawal symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background rationale Opioid-induced constipation common side effect opioid therapy - depend setting 90 % patient take opioids experience constipation conservative estimate among MMT patient 30 % . Currently , recommend treatment opioid-induced constipation include combination stool softener , stimulant osmotic laxative - increase gastrointestinal secretion result increased volume softness fecal mass , intense peristalsis promotes bowel void . The effectiveness exist treatment opioid-induced constipation limit - effective approximately 50 % case , often side effect abdominal cramp diarrhea , importantly , address pathobiological basis opioid-induced constipation . Opioids general methadone particular act peripheral opioid receptor locate myenteric submucosal plexus cause relaxation longitudinal increase tone inner circular smooth muscle well decrease gastrointestinal secretion turn result constipation . The logical therapeutic approach treatment opioid-induced constipation MMT would use opioids cause selective local reversal μ-opioid activation peripherally-acting opioid antagonist naloxone , administer orally systemic effect due extremely low oral bioavailability . Objectives The primary objective evaluate effectiveness combination methadone naloxone 50:1 treatment opioid-induced constipation MMT patient . The secondary objective study assess likelihood development opioid withdrawal symptom MMT patient receive combination methadone naloxone compare receive methadone . Design Study double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design : follow signing informed consent initial assessment 20 subject meet eligibility criterion randomize one two group : group A receive combination methadone naloxone ratio 50:1 show safe effective trial week 1 study methadone week 2 study . Group B receive methadone week 1 study combination methadone naloxone ratio 50:1 week 2 study . Thus , participant receive combination methadone naloxone one week methadone alone one week . Neither study participant , pharmacist observe dos , study personnel know naloxone added subject ' methadone preparation . Allocation Group A Group B do random assignment . The pharmacy research medication management service prepare randomization code balance assignment every 4 subject . Bowel function assess quantitatively primarily use Bowel Function Index ( BFI ) initial assessment end week one ( day 8 ) two study ( day 15 ) . Also data number complete spontaneous bowel movement ( CSBMs ) , temporal relationship medication administration outcome collect every day prior administration next dose methadone . In addition parameter bowel function Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS ) administer daily order ass potential opioid withdrawal symptom . Statistical Methods/Data Analysis Primary endpoint study reduction constipation symptom severity measure difference BFI score take one week receive combination methadone naloxone one week receive methadone . Secondary endpoint study occurrence opioid withdrawal symptom measure difference mean SOWS score take daily two week study . Paired t-test used compare BFI mean number CSBMs week treatment combination methadone naloxone methadone alone well compare average SOWS score week treatment combination methadone naloxone methadone alone .</detailed_description>
