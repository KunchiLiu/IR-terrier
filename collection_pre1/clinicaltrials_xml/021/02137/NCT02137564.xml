	<brief_title>Gamma Secretase Inhibitor PF-03084014 Treating Patients With AIDS-Associated Kaposi Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate tolerance clinical response Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) tumor PF-03084014 ( gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 ) assessments partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess effect PF-03084014 human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) viral load plasma effect PF-03084014 cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ cell number . II . Assess effect PF-030840414 peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tumor Kaposi 's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) latent lytic gene expression . III . Assess effect PF-03084014 activation Notch target gene include tumor-associated endothelial-mesenchymal transition cell proliferation marker . IV . Assess effect trough PF-03084014 drug level clinical response toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients PR , CR , stable disease ( SD ) end 4 course may receive additional 4 course gamma secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>

= 60 % All participant must antiretroviral therapy HIV infection CD4 count &gt; 50/mm^3 viral load &lt; 2,000 copies/mL ; participant must stable regimen least 12 week prior study entry ; participant may receive FDA approve antiretroviral therapy except zidovudine boost protease inhibitor If antiretroviral regimen contain zidovudine strong cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 4 ( Cyp3A4 ) inhibitor ( e.g . ritonavir cobicistatboosted protease inhibitor ) viral load suppress ( measure HIV viral load = &lt; 200/mL ) , antiretroviral therapy must adjust less toxic therapy contain antiviral enrollment may proceed without wait 12 week If antiviral therapy zidovudine boost protease inhibitor , viral load suppress ( measure HIV viral load &gt;
