	<brief_summary>Locally advanced rectal cancer ( T3 , T4 lymph node positive tumor ) conventionally treat 5FU / capecitabine base chemoradiation prior surgical resection . This treatment associate 15-20 % pathological complete response . Selinexor ( KPT-330 ) Selective Inhibitor Nuclear Export ( SINE ) XPO1 antagonist demonstrate radiosensitization vivo model suggest single agent activity colorectal cancer Phase I trial . Here perform Phase I/Ib trial standard chemoradiation combine Selinexor . We hypothesize tumor treat new combination demonstrate increase response rate compare treat capecitabine-radiation alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor Combined With Standard Chemoradiation Neoadjuvant Treatment Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Cancer Society estimate 2012 40,290 new case rectal cancer United States . In 1980 's standard care surgical resection alone , unfortunately associate high rate local recurrence ( 30 % ) node positive T3-4 disease . Randomized study demonstrate efficacy add post-operative subsequently pre-operative chemo-radiation . Preoperative radiation , either concomitant chemotherapy , decrease local recurrence , increase disease-free overall survival improve rate sphincter preservation . The current standard care United States Israel , patient node positive T3 T4 disease preoperative chemo-radiation . The radiation deliver dose 45-55 Gy deliver 5-6 week . The chemotherapy traditionally employ infusional 5- fluorouracil ( 5FU ) . In recent year replace oral 5FU derivative , Capecitabine [ 15 ] . Some European center favor intense short-course preoperative radiation regimen 25Gy 5 day . This regimen rarely use Israel ( United States ) logistical reason ( surgery need rigidly schedule immediately completion radiation ) concern long-term side effect . Pathological complete response time operation cancerous tissue find operative specimen . Pathological complete response indicative sensitivity tumor effectiveness preoperative chemotherapeutic regimen . Pathological complete response associate excellent prognosis term local recurrence , distal recurrence overall survival . Standard preoperative chemoradiation associate pathological complete response 15-20 % . For patient locally advanced disease receive standard chemoradiation , 5 year local recurrence rate expect 6 % 5 year survival 68 % . This open label study therefore propose examine combination chemoradiation Selinexor , SINE XPO1 antagonist , evaluate Phase 1 study solid hematological malignancy show single agent activity heavily pretreated patient CRC . The long-term goal project Is establish new treatment patient rectal cancer improve cure rate lengthen overall survival .</detailed_description>
