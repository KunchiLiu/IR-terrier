	<detailed_description>The current study investigate method enhance cognitive training effect healthy old adult employ combination intervention facilitate neural plasticity optimize readiness learning . Adults age 65 represent fast grow group US population . As , age-related cognitive decline represent major concern public health . Recent research suggest cognitive training older adult improve cognitive performance , effect last 10 year . However , effect typically limited task train , little transfer cognitive ability everyday skill . An adaptive pilot randomize clinical trial examine individual combine impact pair cognitive training transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . tDCS method non-invasive brain stimulation directly stimulate brain region involve active cognitive function enhance neural plasticity pair training task . We compare change cognitive brain function result CT CT combine tDCS use comprehensive neurocognitive , clinical , multimodal neuroimaging assessment brain structure , function , metabolic state .</detailed_description>
