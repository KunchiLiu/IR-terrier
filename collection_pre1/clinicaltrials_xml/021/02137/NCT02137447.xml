	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy high risk surgical wound evaluate rate surgical site infection ( SSIs ) . Hypothesis : Historically , average rate infective complication surgical wound type 7.7 % clean wound , 15 % contaminate 35-40 % dirty wound . The application Prevena ™ Incision Management System ( Kinetic Concepts Inc , San Antonio , TX ) expect reduce rate 50 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Wound infection continue common costly problem surgery . Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) second common type health care - associate infection ( HAI ) , occur 2 % 5 % patient undergoing surgery United States . This percentage correspond approximately 300,000 500,000 surgical site infection ( SSIs ) estimate occur year . Most SSIs involve implant diagnose within 3 week post -- operatively . SSIs lead increase hospital stay , cost , risk death . The cost attributable SSI range $ 3,000 $ 29,000 per SSI per patient depend type operation ; thus , total annual cost approximately reach $ 10 billion . On analysis document nearly 1 million additional inpatient-days $ 1.6 billion excess cost , well twice cost patient without SSI . Moreover , SSIs increase mortality risk 2 11 fold 11 , 77 % deaths patient SSI attribute directly SSIs . Several organization put forth guideline definition recommendation decrease incidence . Attempts make stratify patient various category basis type surgical procedure risk factor patient , include diabetes , malnutrition , hypoxemia . These system use develop criterion prevention wound infection . Appropriate time dose antibiotic , type skin preparation , temperature patient operating room , blood oxygen level patient surgery , management blood glucose level standardize attempt decrease wound infection rate . In addition , debridement tissue may contribute wound infection , particularly ischemic skin subcutaneous tissue , standard surgical procedure . Standardization lead small decrease incidence lead significant reduction overall rate . One reason multifactorial nature SSI development . Factors regard patient pre-operative status , operative procedure intra-operative event , well postoperative course , need address , complete understanding range impact . What known time wound closure , one need minimal number bacteria wind , wound must reasonably well perfuse oxygenate . After surgery , wound perfusion oxygenation evaluate clinical appearance . If wound appear ischemic , assumed perfusion oxygenation adequate . Unfortunately , never quantify . Negative-pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) use speed heal open wound . How occur completely understood , increased generation granulation tissue margin open wound implies increase generation blood vessel substance need promote wound heal . The theory negative pressure stimulation wound heal basis improve perfusion wound . This see open wound recently apply closed surgical wound think high risk infection . Negative-pressure wound therapy also apply closed wound attempt improve wound perfusion oxygenation , theory would eliminate two variable wound infection equation . Techniques - Procedures Complete closure abdominal wall skin follow completion index surgical procedure . Closed suction drain may use time skin closure patient require skin flap elevation attain skin closure . Skin closure accomplish dermal suture / staple . Wound coverage do NPWT Prevena ™ Incision Management System ( Kinetic Concepts Inc , San Antonio , TX ) . The application NPWT do per manufacturer 's instruction use . The application continuous negative pressure apply 125 mm Hg.Antibiotics give patient . The post-operative use antibiotic clear contaminate contaminated case 24-hour prophylactic administration . The post-operative use antibiotic dirty ( infect ) case therapeutic administration , clinically indicate . In infected patient , culture take time index procedure , antibiotic treatment targeted culture result . Wounds assess every 48 hour dress change , also time final dressing removal 2 4 week surgery . The dress removal take place discharge OR 5 - 7 post-operative day OR clinically indicate , whichever come first . Post-discharge follow-up The patient followed-up per routine surgical clinic . At 2 4 week date operation formal evaluation take place . Both evaluation must person surgical clinic .</detailed_description>
