	<brief_summary>According World Health Organization pesticide poison major health problem due million case annually occur worldwide . Farmers particularly high risk pesticide poison work involve pesticide use protect crop . The majority pesticide poisoning occur develop country . On short term realistic reduce farmer ' use pesticide significantly would require secure cost-effective alternative introduce . This lengthy process , undoubtedly support . However , become important make sure farmer protect pesticide exposure meanwhile . Use personal protective equipment minimize pesticide exposure farmer ' body consequently reduce risk pesticide poisoning . However , sparse research identify systematic literature review show position give recommendation personal protective equipment farmer protect pesticide exposure suitable specific condition . The purpose present study examine factor influence farmer ' use personal protective equipment work organophosphate , base examine ability locally adapt personal protective equipment reduce organophosphate exposure . The hypothesis farmer work locally adapt personal protective equipment less acute organophosphate poisoning symptom , high plasma cholinesterase level find feasible solution farmer work daily practice wear . Examining locally adapt personal protective equipment ( onwards refer LAPPE solution ) perform practice implies test intervention study . A randomized crossover experiment design choose partly few farmer recruit since farmer act control partly farmer variation strongly reduce . The performance LAPPE solution test one experiment compare performance farmer ' daily practice wearing ( onwards refer DP solution ) another experiment . The LAPPE solution expect superior performance . The participation sequence ( LAPPE/DP DP/LAPPE ) randomize . The study conduct among farmer Chitwan , Nepal .</brief_summary>

Grey literature search database International Labor Organization , World Health Organization Food Agricultural Organization . STUDY AREA : Nepal divide 75 administrative district . Pesticide consumption data show excessive use pesticide common different crop rice , maize , wheat vegetable production area . Chitwan District select purposively three reason : - One high vegetable grow district Nepal Chitwan . - An excessive pesticide use document Chitwan . - An unpublished study first kind Nepal know research group document seriousness problem Chitwan . A comparative cross-sectional study conduct among 90 vegetable farmer use hand pressure backpack sprayer 90 blood donor . Fifty % , 15 % 13 % pesticide use vegetable farmer could categorize moderately , highly slightly hazardous , respectively , accord World Health Organization Hazard Classification . Organophosphates one common pesticide use vegetable farmer ; moderately hazardous chlorpyrifos imidacloprid well highly hazardous dichlorvos . Poor work practice without adequate safety precaution common among vegetable farmer . The vegetable farmer report high number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom low level acetyl cholinesterase blood donor . Chitwan total population around 566,661 largely uncultivated dense forest Nepali government start spray insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane Malaria Eradication Project 1950s . Immediately , Chitwan become major farm region service infrastructure expand across area . Out total 46,894 hectare arable land , 44,291 hectare use agricultural purpose ( maize , rice , wheat , bean , lentil , mustard vegetable ) . Agriculture primary source income 75 % population . Around 4000-5000 people work population engage vegetable farming . Chitwan 40 village district committee District Agricultural Office consider 10 pocket area term vegetable farm base observation , experiment , monitor personal communication vegetable farmer . The ten pocket area Mangalpur , Jagatpur , Shukranagar , Chainpur , Bhandara , Gitanagar , Sibanagar , Jutpani , Kumroj Padampur . To extent possible farmer fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion present study pocket area recruit : RECRUITMENT STRATEGY : Non-probability . SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION : The sample size calculation base quasi-experimental unpublished study 25 vegetable farmer Chitwan whose acute organophosphate poisoning symptom plasma cholinesterase level measure pre post organophosphate spraying session day daily practice condition . - Mean number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom 1.08±1.32 ( Pre spray measurement ) 2.4±1.87 ( Post spray measurement ) 0.0003 ( P-value ) - Mean U/ml level plasma cholinesterase 1.41±0.59 ( Pre spray measurement ) 1.29±0.54 ( Post spray measurement ) 0.0548 ( P-value ) The pre post organophosphate spraying measurement consider represent `` healthy '' `` unhealthy '' condition vegetable farmer expect , respectively . Thus , present study pre post organophosphate spraying measurement expect resemble result among farmer work organophosphate wear LAPPE solution DP solution , respectively . A sample size suitable study resource gain apply pre post result number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom . - Paired mean = 1.08 , 2.4 - Paired standard deviation = 1.320,1.870 - Correlation = 0 - Sides = 1 , 2 - Alpha = 0.05 - Power = 0.9 Taking consideration dropout , technical problem lead invalid measurement , refusal co-variables multivariate analysis 33 % sample size ( 34 pair ) add , result round 50 pair farmer need present study . DATA ANALYSES : Descriptive : - Frequency , proportion categorical variable - Mean , minimum , maximum standard deviation numeric variable - Table cross background , explanatory feasibility variable LAPPE/DP experiment - Table cross number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom plasma cholinesterase level U/ml Unadjusted ( pair t-test McNemar test ) : - Mean difference number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom experiment - Mean difference plasma cholinesterase level U/ml experiment Adjusted ( mixed model ) : - Number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom LAPPE experiment compare number acute organophosphate poisoning symptom DP experiment adjust baseline value , period effect , experiment sequence explanatory variable . - Plasma cholinesterase level U/ml LAPPE experiment compare plasma cholinesterase level U/ml DP experiment adjust baseline value , period effect , experiment sequence explanatory variable . Sensitivity : To allow confidence main finding robustness assess repeat analysis rigid health outcome definition possible : - Farmers acute organophosphate poisoning symptom LAPPE DP experiment exclude . - Farmers abnormal plasma cholinesterase level U/ml LAPPE DP experiment exclude . - Farmers chronic illness exclude . - Farmers respond `` fake '' symptom exclude . ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS : Informal recognition encouragement Chitwan obtain District Agricultural Office District Public Health Office . An advisory opinion Danish Ethics Committee obtain . Informed consent retrieve farmer participate pre-testing experiment . The plasma cholinesterase measurement make possible identify farmer abnormal level . If case occur farmer exclude study give advice proceed . The small amount blood require consider damaging farmer ' health . However , finger stick may minor risk momentary pain lancet go finger , bruise , visible sore puncture site short period , feel dizziness light headedness . Disposable finger stick lancet use avoid infectious transmission . The LAPPE solution provide farmer participation information folder oral explanation store LAPPE . Despite result study , LAPPE solution improvement farmer ' current practice basically protect accord recommendation World Health Organization Food Agricultural Organization . The choice organophosphates experiment base type organophosphate farmer already use . In word , farmer expose less dangerous pesticide usually expose . During data collection organophosphate store accord safety label recommendation . In case , remain organophosphate use study dispose take safety precaution recommend World Health Organization .
