	<brief_summary>To evaluate reduction fluoroscopy time/dosis safety atrial fibrillation ablation patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation use fluoroscopy image integrate 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system , compare use 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system without fluoroscopy image integration</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduction Fluoroscopy Exposure During Atrial Fibrillation Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The novel fluoroscopic image integrate 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system design minimize exposure X-ray physician , staff patient . This randomize single-center study evaluate reduction fluoroscopy level ( time dosis ) catheter interventional treatment symptomatic , antiarrhythmic refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation use fluoroscopic image integrate 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system , compare use 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system without fluoroscopic image integration . Patients document paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , go receive catheter interventional treatment atrial fibrillation , randomize ( 1:1 ) two group sign informed consent . Group 1 ( CARTOUNIVU ) : use fluoroscopic image integrate 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system . Group 2 ( CARTO3 ) : use 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system without fluoroscopic image integration . The ablation strategy study group , include circumferential isolation ipsilateral pulmonary vein ( PV ) voltage map guide substrate modification . According randomization , ablation procedure perform without fluoroscopic image integration . The primary endpoint study evaluation reduction fluoroscopy level ( fluoroscopy time dosis ) atrial fibrillation ablation procedure . Secondary endpoint include complete isolation pulmonary vein , completely bidirectional block linear ablation line , total procedure time , ablation-related complication .</detailed_description>
