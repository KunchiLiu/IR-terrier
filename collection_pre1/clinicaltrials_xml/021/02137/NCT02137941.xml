	<brief_summary>Chronic stress work public health problem increase morbidity mortality , especially men . Among men military population , firefighter Paris ( FFPs ) particularly expose . To deal stress improve stress management challenging . Psychological fitness require regulate emotion improve effectiveness stress enhance recovery stressful event . The heart coherence ( HC ) program use feedback simple pulse sensor reflect change emotional/psychological state , learn reduce stress stabilize emotion . Another kind psychological fitness focus cognitive training regulate emotion , use technique optimize potential ( TOP ) . The TOP consist learn easy technique mental skill improve cognitive-based problem-solving use respiration , relaxation , visualization . Although never publish peer-review journal , procedure TOP training structure standardized individual group , widely practice air traffic controller , apparently good effect . Moreover , event emotionally ambiguous , provide negative positive outcome . The interpretation ambiguity link individual 's emotional state , anxiety mood . Individuals high level trait anxiety likely interpret event negatively . However , study compare effect HC TOP perceive stress FFPs . Nor long-term effect stress management program ( SMP ) investigate . Furthermore , influence trait anxiety stress level FFPs need clarify . Finally , trial assess level biomarkers stress follow SMP . From observation , hypothesize 1 ) young recruit aim become FFPs particularly expose stress , 2 ) SMP effective reduce perceived stress , 3 ) SMP mainly benefit FFPs high anxiety , 4 ) effect SMP low level biomarkers stress . The aim randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness stress management program perceive stress ( primary outcome variable ) , negative mood , mindfulness , biomarkers stress ( secondary outcome variable ) FFPs . We also aim investigate influence anxiety stress management program effectiveness long-term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The army 's FFPs unit recruit new FFPs month receive twelve-month contract comprise six-month induction program ( 1st month 6th month ) six-month active duty period ( 6th month 12th month ) . Within study , volunteer include 4th month ( baseline measurement first four month train ) , order avoid high drop-out rate occur begin period . Included participant randomly assign ( computer-generated randomization ) one three follow group : TOP , HC , control , stress management program occur last two month induction program ( 4th month 6th month ) . The two stress management program teach experimented psychologist , daily requirement short practice task . All three group receive pharmaceutical placebo order control placebo effect . The placebo comprise starch conceal capsule , require consume 4th month 6th month . The primary outcome perceive stress . Secondary outcome change mood , mindfulness biomarkers stress . All baseline assessment ( 4th month ) repeat three time : end stress management program ( 6th month ) , end six-month active duty period ( 12th month ) 18th month . Enrolment set end 180 FFPs ( 60 per group ) include . We estimate 55 participant group , study would 80 % power detect clinically important difference among group change perceive stress , alpha level 5 % . Gaussian distribution data wil test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Data present mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) . Comparisons group make Wilcoxon matched-pairs test ANOVA appropriate . Relationships data assess Pearson correlation , Principal Components Analysis multivariable generalize estimate equation model appropriate . Significance accept p &lt; 0.05 level . Statistical procedure perform use SPSS Advanced Statistics software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
