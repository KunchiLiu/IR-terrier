	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , blind , placebo control study evaluate safety GSK1278863 acute short-term ( e.g . 14d ) effect calf muscle endurance walk ability subject PAD symptomatic claudication . Functional assessment perform follow single high dose ( 300mg ) , single low dose ( 15mg ) , follow 14 day low dose treatment ( 15mg q.d. ) . The objective study : 1 ) Evaluate safety tolerability GSK1278863 administer single dose sub-chronic low dosing ( i.e . 14 day ) subject peripheral artery disease ; 2 ) To demonstrate potential pharmacodynamic effect GSK1278863 functional measure calf muscle endurance fatigability time walk distance follow single high low dose 14 day multiple low dose administration subject claudication-limited peripheral artery disease . In hypothesis-generating study , multiple assessment ambulatory skeletal muscle function make standardized test claudication-limited exercise performance , 3 ) . Characterize relationship , , dose plasma concentration GSK1278863 pharmacodynamic effect .</detailed_description>
