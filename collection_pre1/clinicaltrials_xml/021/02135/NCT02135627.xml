	<brief_summary>Introduction : Gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleed arise malignant tumor increasingly recognize result oncological advance improve detection method , stem local vessel damage tumor invasion associate derangement hemostatic system ( 1 , 2 ) . Although conventional endoscopic hemostasis method improve outcome UGIB due peptic ulcer non-variceal benign bleeding lesion upper , perhaps low GI tract , data use hemorrhagic , upper low gastrointestinal neoplasm scarce associate vary success initial hemostasis high rebleeding rate ( 3-7 ) . Other recognize single multimodality treatment approach include radiation therapy , interventional angiography , surgery . All exhibit disappointing rebleeding rate , case emergency surgery , high mortality ( 4 , 8-11 ) . Challenges associate bleed tumor include hematological derangement thrombocytopenia , disseminate intravascular coagulation , neutropenia , well endoscopic manipulation friable , diffusely bleed surface attempt hemostasis ( 2 , 12 , 13 ) . The recent advent TC-325 ( HemosprayTM ) Canada , Europe Asia - refer henceforth TC-325 - may provide highly adapt novel endoscopic hemostatic therapeutic alternative refractory clinical entity , promise uncontrolled observation publish group ( 13 ) others ( 14 ) . More robust control evaluative data need . We propose study use TC-325 upper low malignant GI bleeding compare contemporary standard care , specifically seek funding pilot study inform subsequent peer-review application large , definitive randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) .</brief_summary>
