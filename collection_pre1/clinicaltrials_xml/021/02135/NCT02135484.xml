	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive radium-223 vein 1 minute begin every study cycle 6 cycle . Every 4 week study cycle . You need well hydrate dose drink least 2-3 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Do take additional drug , include over-the-counter product herbal/alternative drug , study without talk study doctor first . Study Visits : You study visit dose radium-223 . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test , well check PSA testosterone level . - Urine collect biomarker test . At Week 12 , bone marrow biopsy aspiration perform check status disease biomarker test . At Week 24 follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw routine test , well check PSA testosterone level . Length Study : You may receive study drug 6 dos . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect , study doctor think best interest stop , unable follow study direction . End Treatment Visit : After stop receiving study drug reason , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You sodium fluoride PET/CT scan check status disease . - Blood ( 3-4 tablespoon ) draw routine biomarker test , well check PSA testosterone level . - Urine collect biomarker test . - You bone marrow aspiration biopsy perform biomarker test . Long-Term Follow-Up : The study staff check every 6 month last dose study drug . This consist phone call , e-mail , review medical record . If contact phone , call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Radium-223 FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic CRPC spread bone organ . It investigational look biomarkers may relate CRPC patient receive radium-223 . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 25 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
