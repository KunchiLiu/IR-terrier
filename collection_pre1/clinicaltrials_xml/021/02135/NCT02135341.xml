	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptom syndrome characterized urgency frequency without urgency incontinence , usually metabolic anatomical disorder find may great impact quality life . OAB symptom find significant effect emotional well-being productivity affect . Although several new therapeutic option promise treatment outcome , antimuscarinic drug remain first line treatment clinical effect good tolerability confirm . However , OAB patient benefit antimuscarinic agent , treatment adverse effect dizziness , dry mouth , blur vision , constipation , intolerable patient . Of patient intravesical botulinum toxin ( BoNT ) injection provide alternative treatment favorable efficacy . Based understanding pathophysiology OAB detrusor overactivity ( DO ) , BoNT enthusiastically apply treat urinary urgency incontinence refractory antimuscarinics recent year . Although promising therapeutic effect confirm several case series clinical trial , occurrence adverse event report inconsistently . Analysis patient demographic urodynamic variable reveals patient age , low detrusor contractility , chronic medical disease carry risk adverse event . Although safety efficacy similar elderly patient without frailty younger patient , increase risk large post-void residual urine volume lower long-term success rate frail elderly patient note intravesical 100 U BoNT-A injection refractory idiopathic DO . Therefore , careful dose injection site adjustment patient selection mandatory achieve satisfactory result use intravesical BoNT-A therapy . This study aim compare safety efficacy 100 U suburothelial injection combine 50 U suburothelial 50 U urethral sphincter injection BoNT-A patient detrusor overactivity inadequate contractility ( DHIC ) . A total 60 patient DHIC enrol randomly allocate group treat either regimen . The safety efficacy assess Patient 's Perception Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) different time point injection . The result study may provide valuable evidence rational treatment regimen patient DHIC . Estimated Total Sample Size 60 evaluable patient total recruited Method Patient Assignment Patients meet eligible requirement entry study randomize one two treatment group 1:1 ratio show : 1 . BoNT-A 100 unit normal saline 10ml , suburothelial injection 20 site bladder wall single treatment 2 . BoNT-A 100 unit normal saline 10ml , suburothelial injection 50 U 10 sit 50 U urethral injection 5 site Patient Inclusion Criteria 1 . Adults age 20 year old 2 . Patients symptoms urgency frequency and/or urge incontinence urodynamically proven DHIC ( define International Continence Society ( ICS ) recommendation : spontaneous detrusor contraction occur bladder fill phase occur uninhibited detrusor contraction void bladder capacity less 350ml urodynamic study , postvoid residual 100ml less 250ml ) 3 . Free active urinary tract infection 4 . Free bladder outlet obstruction enrollment 5 . Free overt neurogenic bladder dysfunction 6 . Having treat antimuscarinic agent least 1 month without effect intolerable adverse effect 7 . Patient his/her legally acceptable representative sign write informed consent form Patient Exclusion Criteria 1 . Use antimuscarinic agent effective treatment low urinary tract symptom 2 . Patients severe cardiopulmonary disease congestive heart failure , arrhythmia , poorly control hypertension , able receive regular follow-up 3 . Patients bladder outlet obstruction enrollment 4 . Patients postvoid residual &gt; 250ml 5 . Patients uncontrolled confirmed diagnosis acute urinary tract infection 6 . Patients laboratory abnormality screen include : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 3 x upper limit normal range Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 3 x upper limit normal range Patients abnormal serum creatinine level &gt; 2 x upper limit normal range 7 . Patients contraindication urethral catheterization treatment 8 . Patients serious disease consider investigator condition enter trial 9 . Patients participate investigational drug trial within 1 month enter study Data Analysis The efficacy evaluation perform intention-to-treat population ( ITT ) per-protocol population ( PPP ) datasets safety evaluation perform ITT datasets . The primary conclusion make primary endpoint secondary endpoint ITT population.. Efficacy Endpoint Analysis Net change efficacy item analyze paired t-test baseline post-treatment treatment group control group . The net change efficacy item analyze ANOVA test compare treatment group control group . The global assessment patient analyze chi-square test treatment control group . All efficacy variable report respective point estimate 95 % confidence interval . Comparison test report respective p value . Safety Endpoints Adverse event report controlled treatment group physiological system appropriate . Incidence adverse event category adverse event severity treatment analyze Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test . The coding system use Coding Symbols Thesaurus Adverse Reaction Terms ( COSTART ) . Changes physical examination display individual system . All statistical test use two-tailed Î±= 0.05 .</detailed_description>
