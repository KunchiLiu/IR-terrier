	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial compare topical ablative treatment active monitoring prevent anal cancer patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) . Anal HSIL tissue anal canal damage infection human papillomavirus ( HPV ) risk turn anal cancer . It yet know treat HSIL effective active monitoring prevent patient develop anal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topical Ablative Treatment Preventing Anal Cancer Patients With HIV Anal High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effectiveness treat anal HSIL reduce incidence anal cancer human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected men woman . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety infrared coagulation , electrocautery , imiquimod , 85 % trichloroacetic acid 5-fluorouracil ( fluorouracil ) treatments anal HSIL . II . Compare quality life measure arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine human papilloma virus ( HPV ) type cancer compare overlie HSIL HSIL biopsy collect concurrently progress cancer . II . Determine strain variant HPV 16 participant progressed anal cancer compare participant HSIL biopsy progress cancer . III . Determine HPV integration site overlie anal cancer HSIL overlie cancer HSIL biopsy collect concurrently progress cancer . IV . Perform gene expression array analysis compare expression anal cancer HSIL overlie cancer ; perform gene expression array analysis compare expression HSIL biopsy progress cancer non-progressing HSIL biopsy location ; perform similar analysis compare expression HSIL biopsy progress cancer lesion earlier time point prior progression . V. Characterize genetic change anal cancer compare HSIL overlie cancer ; characterize genetic change HSIL biopsy progress cancer compare non-progressing HSIL biopsy location ; characterize genetic change HSIL biopsy progress cancer lesion earlier time point prior progression . VI . Identify host viral biomarkers progression HSIL cancer . VII . Evaluate medical history behavioral risk factor HSIL progression cancer . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients direct receive either topical ablative treatment discretion clinician . Patients receive topical treatment apply imiquimod intra-anally , peri-anally thrice weekly 16 week , fluorouracil twice daily 5 day every 2 week 16 week , trichloroacetic acid every 3 week 12 week . Patients receive ablative treatment use infrared coagulation , hyfrecation/electrocautery , laser . Patients may undergo excision anesthesia clinician believe none treatment approach effective . The number timing treatment discretion investigator . Patients persistent HSIL continue protocol-approved treatment new protocol treatment consider . ARM II : Patients undergo active monitoring examination every 6 month . Every 12 month , patient undergo biopsy visible lesion . Patients cytology perform every visit . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
