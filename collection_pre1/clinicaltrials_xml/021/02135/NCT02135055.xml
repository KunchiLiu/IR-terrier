	<brief_summary>ICU patient always experience kind pain , discomfort sleep disturbance , especially sepsis patient . Appropriate sedation analgesia must , new sepsis guideline strongly recommend mechanically ventilated sepsis patient need sedation therapy . Recent study show immune dysfunction dose important effect occurrence development sepsis . When body suffer pathogenic microorganism attack sepsis , activate systemic inflammatory response ( SIRS ) compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome ( CARS ) . When balance SIRS CARS , inflammatory response , immune paralysis immune dysfunction occur mixed anti-inflammatory response syndrome ( MARS ) exist , multiple organ dysfunction . So , immune dysfunction think key factor development sepsis . Some study show sedation drug midazolam , propofol , dexmedetomidine could suppress inflammatory response effectively modulate immune function . Several recent study show midazolam immunoregulation effect trend suppress inflammatory response , result controversy , possibly reason different immune status . Now guideline different immune status : normal immune function mean value mHLA-DR 15000 monoclonal antibody ; moderate-sever immune suppression mean value mHLA-DR range 5000 15000 monoclonal antibody ; immune paralysis mean value mHLA-DR less 5000 monoclonal antibody . The purpose study explore effect midazolam inflammatory response organ function mechanically ventilated sepsis patient different immune status .</brief_summary>
