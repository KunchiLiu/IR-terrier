	<brief_title>Evaluation AUTONOM @ DOM Telemonitoring System People With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic disease heart failure major burden healthcare system They punctuate exacerbation , often markers poor prognosis , associate expensive unscheduled hospitalization . After initial diagnosis , despite development drug physical therapy , rate re-hospitalization heart failure remain high 50 % patient readmitted within 6 month . Recommendations treatment heart failure patient extremely precise justify close collaboration local community service hospital . However often considerable divergence recommend care reality , due particular difficulty monitor ambulatory patient . For example , dose titration beta-blockers ACE inhibitor need monitor , dosages diuretic need adapt avoid side effect affect quality life patient limit medication adherence etc . The establishment 'ambulatory ' care network ( include multidisciplinary health professionnals city hospital therapeutic patient education ) Isère County France demonstrate effectiveness . However , advanced tool patient monitoring still need assessed , particularly 'home monitoring ' , yet consensus role tele-monitoring play context heart failure , date recommendation vague . Assess clinical medico-economic benefit innovative patient monitoring strategy 'AUTONOM @ DOM ' need . The primary aim study ass system home base telemonitoring .The main outcome unscheduled hospitalisation heart failure . secondary aim assess efficacy system , quality life medico-economic benefit . This pilot study realise Isère Essonne county France . Patients diagnose heart failure randomize one follow group : - conventional care include least patient education program ( ETICS program Essone county RESIC38 network Isere county ) ; - conventional care , plus home telemonitoring include record heart rate , blood pressure weight , remotely transmitted cardiologist approve validated system include alert monitoring feature . The study last one year start April 2014 .</detailed_description>
