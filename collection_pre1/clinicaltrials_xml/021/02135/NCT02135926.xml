	<detailed_description>This prospective , binational ( Germany Austria ) , two-arm , randomize , control , open label , blind endpoint post-market study compare safety effectiveness stent retriever thrombectomy compare best medical treatment alone acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) patient eligible IV-tPA treatment . Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize one follow two treatment arm : - best medical care alone - best medical care plus endovascular thrombectomy stent retriever ( referred thrombectomy ) . Endpoints prospective open label study assess blind treatment assignment patient ( PROBE design ) . This study conduct 20 center Germany Austria . This adaptive design study , prospectively state interim analysis specify stop rule , allow possibility study terminate early base either determination study success futility continue enrollment . Up six hundred ( 600 ) subject , 300 per treatment group , enrol randomize study Intent Treat ( ITT ) analysis set . The randomization stratify time symptom onset stroke severity ( NIHSS ) . The expected duration subject‟s enrollment approximately 90 day . Subjects follow assessment 30 ( +/-6 ) hour , hospital discharge , 90 ( +/-14 ) day post stroke . A blinded core laboratory assess baseline image confirm vessel occlusion determine ASPECT score , 30 ( +/- 6 ) hour post treatment image assess presence ICH , measure core infarct volume . The primary effectiveness endpoint subject blind evaluation ordinal mRS outcome 90 day post-stroke . The primary effectiveness endpoint analysis chi-square test difference linear trend mRS outcomes 90 day post-stroke treatment group ( `` mRS shift analysis '' ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient ineligible treatment IV tPA accord license criterion ( e.g . anticoagulation , previous surgery , beyond 4.5 hour symptom onset ) . Randomization within 7 hour stroke onset . Endovascular treatment expect finish within 8 hour symptom onset judgment interventional Neuroradiologist charge . Patient must demonstrate clinical sign symptom attributable target area occlusion consistent diagnosis ischemic stroke , include impairment following : language , motor function , sensation , cognition , gaze , and/or vision least 30 minute without relevant improvement . Female male patient 1880 year age NIHSS Score &gt; 7 &lt; 25 Patient sign inform consent ( IC ) form patient , legal representative , independent physician familiar type illness option possible . A new focal occlusion confirm imaging ( MRA/CTA ) accessible thrombectomy device , locate M1 middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) and/or intracranial segment distal internal carotid artery ( ICA ) . Prior new focal neurological deficit , mRS score ≤1 . Patient eligible receives IV tPA accord license criterion Patient international normalize ratio ( INR ) &gt; 3 Patient active participant another drug device treatment trial disease state , patient expect start participation another drug device treatment trial enrol protocol , unless approve Sponsor . Patient preexist neurological psychiatric disease could impede study result would confound neurological functional evaluation . Patient carotid dissection , high grade stenosis ≥ 70 % proximal occlusion require stenting , excessive tortuosity gain access occlusion , determine MRA/ CTA neck head . Patient vascular disease prevent endovascular treatment ( e.g . aortic dissection aneurysm , arterial transfemoral access ) Patient history contraindication contrast medium . Patient known infective endocarditis CT scan MRI evidence : Mass effect intracranial tumor , hypodensity unenhanced CT cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) drop CBV map Computed Tomography Perfusion ( CTP ) , , alternatively per institutional standard , restrict diffusion Diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score ( ASPECTs ) 6 less Female childbearing potential know pregnant and/or lactate positive pregnancy test admission . Patient‟s anticipated life expectancy le 6 Months .</criteria>
