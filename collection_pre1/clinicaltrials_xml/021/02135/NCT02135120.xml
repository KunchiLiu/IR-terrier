	<brief_title>The Efficacy Peripheral Nerve Blocks With Intrathecal Morphine Improving Analgesia After Unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgery associate severe pain . The success knee rehabilitation follow surgery depend largely adequate pain control permit early physical therapy . Postoperative modern analgesic recommendation specific TKA propose either spinal block intrathecal morphine ( ITM ) combination general anesthesia single shot femoral nerve block ( SFNB ) . Femoral nerve block ( FNB ) prove analgesic advantage TKA surgery . However , know combination two analgesic technique , ITM peripheral nerve block ( PNB ) , provide superior analgesia ITM alone . Thus , study aim determine whether ITM alone combination PNB provide good analgesia patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Eligible patient undergoing unilateral TKA spinal anesthesia consent multimodal analgesic regimen inclusive ITM , FNB , SNB recruit . All patient receive spinal intrathecal morphine . Patients randomly assign use computer generate table random number receive either spinal intrathecal morphine ( morphine group ) , combination intrathecal morphine femoral nerve block ( morphine-femoral group ) , combination intrathecal morphine femoral nerve block well sciatic nerve block ( morphine-femoral-sciatic group ) .</detailed_description>
