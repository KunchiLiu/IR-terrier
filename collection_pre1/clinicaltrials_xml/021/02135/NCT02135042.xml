	<brief_summary>There two study question ask randomized phase II/III trial base blood biomarker , Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) locoregionally advanced non-metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer . All patient first undergo standard concurrent chemotherapy radiation therapy . When standard treatment complete , detectable EBV DNA plasma , patient randomize either standard adjuvant cisplatin fluorouracil chemotherapy observation . If still detectable level plasma EBV DNA , patient randomize standard cisplatin fluorouracil chemotherapy versus gemcitabine paclitaxel . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , fluorouracil , gemcitabine hydrochloride , paclitaxel work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give cisplatin fluorouracil effective gemcitabine hydrochloride paclitaxel radiation therapy treat patient nasopharyngeal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether substitute adjuvant concurrent high dose cisplatin ( CDDP ) fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) paclitaxel result superior progression-free survival . ( Detectable Plasma Epstein Barr Virus [ EBV ] Deoxyribonucleic Acid [ DNA ] Cohort randomize Phase II ) II . To determine whether omit adjuvant CDDP 5-FU ( observation alone adjuvant set ) result non-inferior overall survival compare patient receive adjuvant CDDP 5-FU chemotherapy . ( Undetectable Plasma EBV DNA Cohort Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Time distant metastasis . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) II . Time local progression . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) III . Time regional progression . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) IV . Progression-free survival ( Undetectable Cohort ) . V. Overall survival ( Detectable Cohort ) . VI . Acute late toxicity profile base clinician-reported Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version ( v. ) 4 . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) VII . Death within 30 day end protocol treatment . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) VIII . Quality life ( general physical well-being ) . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) IX . Quality life ( hear ) . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) X . Quality life ( peripheral neuropathy ) . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) XI . Cost effectiveness . ( Randomized Phase II Phase III ) OUTLINE : Patients undergo intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6.5 week receive low-dose cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute weekly IMRT . Beginning 1 week chemoradiation , plasma sample collect EBV DNA analysis . PHASE II : Patients detectable EBV DNA pre-treatment analysis randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive PF regimen comprise cisplatin IV 60-120 minute fluorouracil IV 96 hour continuously begin least 4 week completion IMRT . Treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive GT regimen comprise paclitaxel IV 1 hour gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 least 4 week completion IMRT . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE III : Patients undetectable EBV DNA pre-treatment analysis randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM III : Patients receive PF regimen Arm I . ARM IV : Patients undergo clinical observation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
