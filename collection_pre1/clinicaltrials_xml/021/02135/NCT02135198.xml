	<brief_summary>GABA ( gamma-aminobutyric acid ) main inhibitory compound human brain . Drugs enhance effect bind GABA receptor ( e.g. , benzodiazepine ) use treat various disease epilepsy , insomnia , anxiety movement disorder . However , use medication often compromise due side effect , like sedation , cognitive impairment , addiction . Many side effect link particular type GABA receptor ( GABA A alpha 1 ) . Therefore , effort make develop drug act receptor , maintain beneficial property act type GABA receptor . AZD7325 drug selectively act GABA A alpha 2 A alpha 3 receptor , A alpha 1 . It test 700 people far prove generally well tolerate . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) study human demonstrate AZD7325 bind GABA A receptor brain single dose . Early clinical study show less sedative cognitive adverse event compare benzodiazepine lorazepam . In study , investigate effect short interval intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) . SICI neurophysiological marker inhibitory process motor cortex . It obtain non-invasively use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . In TMS , magnetic impulse apply scalp turn induce current small area brain . If apply motor area brain , impulses result muscle twitch record surface electrode . SICI enhance certain drug like benzodiazepine act GABA A alpha 1,2,3 , 5 receptor subtypes , zolpidem act solely alpha 1 subtype . Because GABA A alpha 5 receptor subtype less common cortex , conclude drug effect SICI relate GABA A alpha 2 alpha 3 receptor . If AZD7325 prove enhance SICI healthy volunteer , would create ground use medication treat certain neurological disorder SICI find impaired ( e.g. , dystonia ) .</brief_summary>
