	<brief_summary>The purpose study conduct prospective , randomize , control trial compare restrictive vs. conservative fluid strategy thoracic surgery patient . Excessive perioperative fluid retrospectively implicate development postoperative acute lung injury ( PALI ) pulmonary edema follow lung resection . However , fluid restriction patient without risk may compromise end organ perfusion ( i.e . acute kidney injury ) . The hypothesis conservative fluid approach thoracic surgery patient result good end organ perfusion few occasion acute kidney injury ( AKI ) without cause increase postoperative acute lung injury pulmonary edema .</brief_summary>
