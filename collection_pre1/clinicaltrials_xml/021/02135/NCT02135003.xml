	<detailed_description>A randomized trial assess effect patient-selected care buddy ( PSCB ) adherence pre-ART clinic appointment , clinical immunologic outcomes patient receive pre-Anti-retroviral therapy ( pre-ART ) HIV care rural community HIV care program Standard care : Patients enrol pre-ART care ( CD4 &gt; 250 cells/ul ) receive general health education , schedule unscheduled clinical monitoring , CD4 test clinically indicate investigation , treatment opportunistic infection , cotrimoxazole prophylaxis . A client expect come clinic least three month . Patient select Care buddy intervention : In addition standard care ( ) , pre-ART patient randomize PSCB arm request choose care buddy aware patient 's HIV infection resides household close proximity . Care buddy attend least two HIV health education session similar provide study participant . Information HIV , importance adhere schedule clinic visit prescribe medication emphasize . Buddies request remind participant take prophylactic treatment , remind clinic appointment . No compensation participation give buddy . Randomization procedure Randomization concealment This do minimize systematic bias allocation patient intervention non-intervention study arm . I use stratified block randomization restrict chance imbalance ensure study arm alike possible patient enrollment factor , include key factor sex CD4 effect outcomes adherence pre-ART schedule clinic appointment . A set permute block generate combination stratification factor . In study , factor include patient sex CD4 cell count . Concealment patient allocation study arm do avoid conscious unconscious selection patient study . The research assistant assess eligibility patient , seek consent study participation , enrollment officer seal trial randomization envelop let patient pick envelope contain study arm . To ensure unbiased allocation patient study arm , I use vary block size , specifically size 6 recruit officer guess study arm follow ( Concealment sequence generation ) . I use computer-generated allocation sequence randomization ratio 1:1 , PSCB SOC We collect data use interviewer-administered questionnaire HIV clinic form . Patients receive questionnaire baseline , six month 12 month follow visit . All visit conduct HIV clinic . At baseline visit , collect socio-demographic information include level education , occupation , marital status , distance HIV clinic , willingness select buddy well readiness disclose HIV status buddy . At 6 12 month follow visit , information continue possession buddy , change loss buddy , relationship perceive helpfulness buddy ( intervention arm ) , self-reported adherence clinic appointment cotrimoxazole , quality life sexual behavior include sexual activity , condom use number sexual partner ( marital non-marital ) collect . As per clinic schedule , patient require come clinic cotrimoxazole refill least 3 monthly blood draw CD4 test follow : 3 month previous CD4 count 251-350 cells/ul six month CD4 great 350 cells/ul . Routine clinic data , collect clinic form include patient visit data ( visit date , number cotrimoxazole pill dispense , blood sample take test ) , health status ( e.g . opportunistic infection diagnose , Karnofsky score , WHO stag ) laboratory result , include CD4 count investigation clinically indicate . Blood CD4 test collect participant various community clinic transport central Rakai Health Sciences Program laboratory Kalisizo.CD4 count assess flow cytometry use FACS Calibur ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA ) .</detailed_description>
