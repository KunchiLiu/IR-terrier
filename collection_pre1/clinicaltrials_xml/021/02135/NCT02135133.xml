	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate combination drug call Ofatumumab Idelalisib possible treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Small Lymphocytic Leukemia ( SLL ) . The main purpose study examine combination two drug , Ofatumumab Idelalisib , participant diagnose CLL/SLL previously receive treatment require treatment . The investigator hope observe participant ' disease impact treatment whether benefit combine drug together rather take separately . Both drug use treatment CLL / SLL information research study suggest drug may help patient CLL/SLL . Ofatumumab antibody engineer lab CD20 , protein surface CLL cell , express CLL . An antibody molecule body create identify foreign substance destroy . Ofatumumab FDA approve treatment CLL/SLL relapse progressed therapy . Idelalisib drug block one signal inside cell cause type cancer grow survive . The investigator hope combine Ofatumumab Idelalisib stop growth disease . In research study , investigator evaluate side effect combine two drug , gather information CLL/SLL disease process study affect patient 's cell , well assess outcome disease . This combination drug previously test , appear well tolerate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , participant ask undergo screening test procedure find eligible research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . If participant test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question participant 's health , current medication , allergy . - Physical examination , include vital sign , height , weight , disease assessment size participant 's spleen , liver , lymph node . - Performance status , evaluate participant able carry usual activity . - An assessment patient 's tumor CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan , MRI PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan , - Bone marrow aspirate biopsy : A study tube ( plastic cylinder container contain biopsy material ) drawn biopsy ass participant 's disease status . - Blood test , maximum 24 teaspoon collect . - Urine test . - A blood pregnancy test - A Hepatitis B C test , require blood sample . If test show participant eligible participate research study , participant begin begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , participant able participate research study . Additional research procedure perform time screening : • Blood test , include baseline test investigator measure additional effect study drug disease status After screen procedure confirm eligible participate research study : If take part research study , participant give study drug-dosing diary treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day . The diary also include special instruction take study drug . - Study Drugs : The participant first give Idelalisib daily two cycle 28 day . Idelalisib give orally . Once participant completes 2 cycle Idelalisib , participant start receive combination Ofatumumab Idelalisib . This regimen continue weekly complete 8 week ( two cycle ) . This follow monthly Ofatumumab Idelalisib complete 4 additional cycle ( eight total ) . The overall treatment period therefore 8 month , comprise two month Idelalisib follow 6 month Ofatumumab Idelalisib . After complete 8-month treatment , participant likely continue Idelalisib . Restaging CT scan happen Cycle 2 , 4 , final restage occur 2 month completion Ofatumumab . There tumor response assessment do physical exam Cycle 8 . - Clinical Exams : During cycle participant physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . - Scans ( Imaging test ) : The investigator ass participant 's tumor CT scan . Restaging CT scan happen Cycle 2 , 4 , final restage occur 2 month completion Ofatumumab . - Bone marrow aspirate biopsy : conduct see bone marrow tumor cell . A study tube drawn biopsy assess patient 's disease status - Blood test Additional Blood Tests : Blood Tests perform throughout study Investigator measure additional effect study drug disease status . These test take day list participant receive study drug , day additional blood drawn receive study drug . Cycle 3 Day 1 Cycle 3 Day 8 Cycle 3 Day 15 Cycle 4 Day 21 ( last weekly Ofatumumab dose ) Cycle 5 Day 1 ( first monthly Ofatumumab dose ) Cycle 8 Day 1 ( last monthly Ofatumumab dose ) 2 month Ofatumumab therapy complete 6 month Ofatumumab therapy complete Planned Follow-up : Once participant complete study treatment , participant monitor start new type treatment remove study . During time participant meet research physician every 3 6 month . The investigator would like keep track participant 's medical condition rest life . The investigator would like call participant telephone year see participant . Keeping touch participant check condition every year help investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Subjects must CLL / SLL , document history point absolute peripheral blood B cell count &gt; 5000 , monoclonal B cell population coexpressing CD19 , CD5 , CD23 , CD23 negative , documentation absence ( 11 ; 14 ) cyclin D1 overexpression . Alternatively patient lymphadenopathy absence circulate disease also eligible study lymph node biopsy establishes diagnosis CLL immunophenotype . Participants must measurable disease ( lymphocytosis &gt; 5,000 , palpable CT measurable lymphadenopathy &gt; 1.5 cm , bone marrow involvement &gt; 30 % ) . Subjects must receive prior systemic therapy CLL currently indication treatment define IWCLL 2008 Guidelines : Massive progressive splenomegaly ; OR Massive lymph node , nodal cluster , progressive lymphadenopathy ; OR Grade 2 3 fatigue ; OR Fever ≥ 100.5°F night sweat great 2 week without documented infection ; OR Presence weight loss ≥ 10 % precede 6 month ; OR Progressive lymphocytosis increase ≥ 50 % 2month period anticipate doubling time le 6 month ; OR Evidence progressive marrow failure manifest development worsen anemia thrombocytopenia . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( see Appendix A ) . Age ≥ 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use idelalisib ofatumumab participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . Participants must normal organ marrow function define : creatinine &lt; 2.0 time upper normal limit , total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper normal limit ( unless due disease involvement liver , hemolysis know history Gilbert 's disease ) ALT &lt; 2.5 time upper normal limit ( unless due disease involvement liver ) alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 time upper normal limit ( unless due disease involvement liver bone marrow ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document .
