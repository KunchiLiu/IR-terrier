	<brief_title>The Use Heliox Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common condition affect 2-4 % general population . The pathophysiologic consequence OSA include : excessive daytime sleepiness lead increased car work related accident ; increase incidence hypertension ( HTN ) , stroke possibly coronary artery event . In addition , patient severe untreated obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) increase mortality compare patient treat severe OSA.The main stay treatment OSAS application continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) sleep . The main problem CPAP therapy compliance . Heliox , mixture oxygen helium use many year treatment upper airway obstruction . In study , investigator evaluate effectiveness Heliox treatment OSAS . Adult subject diagnosis obstructive sleep apnea syndrome refer repeat sleep study CPAP titration evaluate .</detailed_description>
