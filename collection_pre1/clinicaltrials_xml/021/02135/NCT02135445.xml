	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy TAK-385 Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-385 . Men prostate cancer benefit receive androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) minimize testosterone level , EBRT . This combination increase potential success treat disease . This study see TAK-385 [ oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) antagonist ] brings testosterone level sufficiently , convenience comfort take pill . It look time take restore testosterone level radiation therapy well . One hundred participant assign chance ( like flip coin ) treatment group : 60 TAK-385 , 40 degarelix . Those assigned TAK-385 take daily pill . Those assigned degarelix receive injection skin every four week clinic . They start radiation therapy testosterone low enough , least 12 week treatment . This trial conduct clinic United States ( US ) United Kingdom ( UK ) . Participants visit clinic 14 time 37 week physical exam blood test , might receive one follow-up telephone call .</detailed_description>
