	<brief_title>The Role IGRA Screening Monitoring TB During Anti TNF Therapy Patients With IMID</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence inflammatory bowel disease rise Hong Kong . Anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha ( anti-TNF ) -Î± effective increasingly use treatment patient refractory disease complicate disease behaviour . The reactivation latent tuberculosis ( TB ) well-recognised complication associate use anti-TNF therapy , case occur endemic region . Hong Kong region intermediate TB burden , reactivation latent TB IMID patient treat anti-TNF serious problem . Screening show reduce incidence TB , remain unclear whether monitor anti-TNF therapy effective . Despite report efficacy current screening strategy , active TB develop 11.4 % patient receive anti-TNF therapy . There therefore urgent need good disease monitoring prevention , particularly region TB endemic . Part I study aims investigate role IGRA screen latent TB IBD patient control subject . Part II study prospective study serial interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRA ) diagnosis tuberculosis ( TB ) infection patient immune-mediated inflammatory disease ( IMID ) treat biologics</detailed_description>
