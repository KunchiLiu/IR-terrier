	<brief_summary>This phase IV multicenter trial evaluate real-world health outcome , economic impact resistance mechanism panitumumab treatment patient chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer ( mCRC ) . This study address two anticipated issue surround personalized medicine treatment panitumumab . First , enable assess economic impact panitumumab real-life setting ( HEOR study ) . Second , identify new blood-based mechanism resistance , may lead new avenue combination therapy metastatic colorectal cancer ( Blood study ) . The primary objective collect information quality life health care resource utilization patient diagnose metastatic colorectal cancer . The secondary objective confirm survival data , ass quality life patient assess health care resource utilization patient . The blood biomarker study objective determine blood-based biomarkers response resistance panitumumab . Patients mutate KRAS gene treat standard-of-care ( SOC ) participate HEOR study . Patients non-mutated ( wild type ) KRAS gene treat panitumumab participate HEOR study blood biomarker study . During course study , data collect quality life work productivity . Patients ask fill set questionnaire recruitment study every 3 month treatment initiation . For patient participate blood study ( patient wild type KRAS ) , blood sample collect patient start treatment , every treatment discontinue treatment .</brief_summary>
