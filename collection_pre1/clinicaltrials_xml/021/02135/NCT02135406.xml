	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Subjects must undergo prior ASCT MM progress within 365 day stem cell infusion . Patients underwent syngeneic transplant ( i.e. , transplant identical twin donor ) rather autologous transplant eligible syngeneic transplant consider equivalent ASCT purpose inclusion/exclusion criterion . Progression define accord IMWG criterion progressive disease143 ( Table 4 ) . Subjects undergone two prior ASCTs part plan tandem ASCT consolidation regimen eligible . Patients first progression identify day 366 450 ( inclusive ) ASCT eligible progression identify first evaluation progression window evaluate day 270 365 progression . This clause account practice pattern patient otherwise well monitor infrequently ( every 36 month ) relapse recover first ASCT . This allow infrequently monitor patient included progression identify `` 12 month followup evaluation '' appointment happen schedule outside 365day postASCT window . N.B . : There requirement patient must enroll within 365 day prior ASCT , patient may treat agent , include experimental agent , follow relapse/progression prior ASCT enrollment study . Subjects must receive part initial therapy MM , prior first ASCT , regimen contain either bortezomib lenalidomide . Subjects must confirm diagnosis active MM prior first ASCT define IMWG criteria143 , exception patient treat active MM account recurrent , complicate infection clinical manifestation account progressive smolder MM imminent clinical complication may include . Subjects must sign write , informed consent . Subjects must ≥ 18 &lt; 70 year age . Subjects must anticipate survival &gt; 100 day highdose melphalan . Subjects must adequate vital organ function define follow criterion : Serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 estimate creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min dialysisdependent . Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/μl platelet count ≥50,000/μl . SGOT ≤ 3x upper limit normal total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl ( except patient hyperbilirubinemia attribute Gilbert 's syndrome ) . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 45 % Adequate pulmonary function FEV1 , FVC , TLC , DLCO ( appropriate adjustment lung volume hemoglobin concentration ) ≥40 % predict value . Toxicities prior therapy must recover grade ≤2 accord CTC 4.0 criterion subject 's prior baseline . Subjects must ECOG performance status 02 , unless high performance status due solely bone pain . Subjects must willing comply requirement RevAssist program maintenance lenalidomide plan . Subjects must measurable disease study entry . Measurable disease may include quantifiable detectable level serum urine paraprotein . For patient minimally secretory disease nonsecretory myeloma study entry , serum free lambda kappa light chain level serum free light chain ratio may measure used disease monitoring abnormal . Likewise , patient IgA MM serum protein electrophoresis deem unreliable due comigration normal serum protein paraprotein , elevate total serum IgA level may consider measurable disease . Subjects must store usable condition second ASCT , judge principal investigator , ≥3x106 CD34+ cell per kg body weight ( either autologous syngeneic ) store least two bag administration minimum dose 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg require protocol separate aliquot least 1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg remain rescue infusion event graft failure . Patients inadequate stem cell store may still sign consent undergo mobilization/collection procedure either apheresis T cell harvest . If require undertaken prior apheresis T cell harvest , two week must elapse last day stem cell collection apheresis T cell harvest . Table 5 IMWG Criteria Progression One follow criterion must meet : Increase ≥25 % baseline Serum Mcomponent ( absolute increase must ≥0.5 g/dl ) ( baseline Mcomponent ≥5 g/dl , increase ≥1 g/dl sufficient define progression ) and/or Urine Mcomponent ( absolute increase must X200 mg/24 h ) and/or The difference involve uninvolved FLC level ( patient without measurable serum urine Mprotein level ) ( absolute increase must &gt; 10 mg/dl ) . Bone marrow plasma cell percentage ( absolute % must ≥10 % ) For case IgA MM SPEPs unavailable deem unreliable due migration paraprotein beta region , total IgA level may use assess progression response therapy . Definite development new bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma definite increase size exist bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma . Development hypercalcemia ( correct serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dl 2.65 mmol/l ) attribute solely plasma cell proliferative disorder IMWG Criteria Diagnosis Multiple Myeloma Presence Mcomponent serum and/or urine plus clonal plasma cell bone marrow and/or document clonal plasmacytoma . In patient detectable Mcomponent , abnormal serum FLC ratio serum FLC assay substitute satisfy criterion . For patient , serum urine Mcomponent normal serum FLC ratio , baseline bone marrow must ≥10 % clonal plasma cell ; patient refer 'nonsecretory myeloma ' . Patients biopsyproven amyloidosis and/or systemic light chain deposition disease ( LCDD ) classify 'myeloma documented amyloidosis ' 'myeloma document LCDD , ' respectively ≥30 % plasma cell and/or myelomarelated bone disease . PLUS one following , must attributable underlying plasma cell disorder : Calcium elevation ( &gt; 11.5 mg/dl ) Renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl ) Anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl 2 g/dl normal ) Bone disease ( lytic lesion osteopenia ) Exclusion Criteria Subjects must : Be pregnant lactating . Have inadequate venous access contraindication leukapheresis . Have active uncontrolled infection . Have active chronic hepatitis B [ detectable hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ] , hepatitis C [ positive serology ( HCV Ab ) ] , HIV infection . Any uncontrolled medical disorder would preclude participation outline . Have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Have receive prior gene therapy genemodified cellular immunotherapy . Subject may receive , however , nongenemodified autologous Tcells first ASCT association antimyeloma vaccine ( e.g. , hTERT MAGEA3 ) vaccination infectious agent ( e.g. , influenza pneumococcus ) perform previous study . Have undergone two prior ASCTs second ASCT salvage ASCT ( define second ASCT perform upon progression follow first ASCT ) rather second ASCT part tandem ASCT consolidation regimen . Have autoimmune disease ( include connective tissue disease , uveitis , sarcoidosis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis ) active severe judgment principal investigator , history autoimmune disease require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy judgment principal investigator . Have active central nervous system disease , include CNS involvement malignancy evidence blood CNS subdural hematoma . If subject neurological abnormality examination , baseline brain MRI require exclude structural disease and/or intracranial bleeding . Patients clinically significant intracranial lesion exclude . Patients common agerelated change clinically significant ( i.e . moderate small vessel ischemic change ) need exclude . Have Class III/IV cardiovascular disability accord New York Heart Association Classification</criteria>
