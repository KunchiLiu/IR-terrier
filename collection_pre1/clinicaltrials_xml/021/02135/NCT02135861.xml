	<brief_summary>Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 ( TRPV4 ) channel blockade may promise treatment pulmonary oedema dyspnoea heart failure ( HF ) acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) patient re-establishing alveolar septal barrier . Dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) establish technique assess change vascular permeability interstitial water volume . The aim study establish potential utility DCE-MRI novel endpoint dose range proof mechanism study TRPV4 blocker . The DCE-MRI marker vascular permeability pulmonary oedema measure subject HF ( group 2 ) healthy volunteer ( HV ) ( group 1 ) rest determine difference two population . Apart , exercise induce change relative rest interstitial volume exchange rate evaluate HV subject HF . Additionally , capability DCE-MRI detect change interstitial lung fluid patient acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) ( group 3 ) investigate . DCE-MRI marker pulmonary oedema assess patient initially hospitalize ADHF subsequently receive standard care treatment determine whether difference detect methodology.This study enrol sufficient number subject least 24 subject Group 1 2 ( group 1:12 HV group 2 : 12 subject HF ) atleast 5 subject Group 3 . For subject , MRI data must sufficient quality enable DCE-MRI modelling 2 Sessions . For group 1 2 , subject screen visit 3 MRI session . For first scanning session , subject undergo baseline procedure . The second imaging session occur approximately one week later measure within subject variability . A third imaging session ( conducted 2 visit ) incorporate bicycle exercise challenge prior MRI scan , third scan perform approximately one three day second imaging session . For group 3 : Screening occur hospitalization eligibility . Session 1of MRI conduct subject still hospitalize . Session 2 conduct within 4 week first scan , sign pulmonary oedema consider resolve . If subject 's pulmonary oedema resolve Session 2 , subject scan MRI Session 2 bring back Session 3 4 week Session 2 second MRI .</brief_summary>
