In addition activity , reach wheelchair put strain shoulder many environment ideally set wheelchair user . These new stressor believe medical community lead shoulder pain . The prevalence shoulder pain person spinal cord injury 30-70 % . Untreated , shoulder pain may lead additional loss function community mobility . Previous research show shoulder exercise along education improve one 's technique wheelchair propulsion , transfer , weight relief raise significantly reduce chronic shoulder pain improve quality life . The investigator aim reduce exist shoulder pain , also prevent onset new pain . The current study teach 4 simple shoulder strengthen exercise perform prior study patient healthy shoulder . Half patient receive 2 session one-to-one train physical therapist , half receive 4 session train combined interactive education program technique protect shoulder class format lead physical therapist peer mentor spinal cord injury .
