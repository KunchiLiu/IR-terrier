	<brief_summary>Despite intense research effort clinical trial , still effective treatment prolong survival patient IPF . Conventional therapeutic approach include combination corticosteroid , anti-oxidants , immunodepressants immune modulatory anti-fibrotic agent discontinue 20 day screen . The , far , therapeutic approach proven effective term prolong patient 's survival lung transplantation . Nonetheless , patient IPF eligible lung transplantation ; significant proportion patient finally succumb wait lung transplantation list . Therefore , critical need effective reliable therapeutic modalities5 . Adult Stem Cells ( ASCs ) seem represent one . Therefore , conceivable assume adult-stem cell easily safely apply novel therapeutic agent chronic fatal lung disease , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) IPF . Therefore , urgent need provide safe , effective affordable treatment option IPF patient . New diagnostic , prognostic therapeutic strategy need develop reduce burden IPF . Given present lack appropriate treatment adjunctive therapy IPF , adipose derive stromal vascular fraction provide new opportunity development . MSCs anti-fibrotic activity hence may excellent source tackle pulmonary fibrosis hence could explore therapeutic potential treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . MSC 's also display membrane-bound insoluble secrete molecule involve cell attachment neighbour cell extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cell home bloodstream mesenchymal tissue.14 As limited clinical information available use SVF MSC IPF patient hence Open Label , Prospective , Randomized multi center comparative study undertaken explore tolerability &amp; effectiveness SVF one treatment arm MSC second treatment arm IPF patient . Adipose derive stromal vascular fraction Mesenchymal Stem Cells find preclinical study safe effective</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction ( ADSVF ) Stromal Vascular Fraction ( SVF ) obtain tumescent liposuction . The SVF contain variety cell pre-adipocytes , endothelial cell , smooth muscle cell , pericytes , fibroblast , adult stem cell ( ASCs ) . In addition , SVF also contain blood cell capillary supply fat cell . These include erythrocyte red blood cell , B T cell , macrophage , monocyte , mast cell , natural killer ( NK ) cell , hematopoietic stem cell endothelial progenitor cell , name . It also contain growth factor transform growth factor beta ( TGF-β ) , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) , among others . This consistent secretion cell presence extracellular matrix . The SVF also contain various protein present adipose tissue extracellular matrix laminin interest due ability help neural regeneration.Entire procedure SVF preparation isolation SVF cell carry cGMP compliance clean room . Pure stromal vascular fraction tune 99 % isolated clinical trial eliminate unnecessary cell RBC leukocytes . Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( ADMSC ) Human mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) present rare population cell adipose tissue almost 30-40 % nucleated cell , rapidly grow culture without lose stemness . MSCs expand vitro ≥ 2 million -fold retain ability differentiate several mesenchymal lineage . MSCs several characteristic Ease isolation , High expansion potential , Genetic stability , Reproducible attribute isolate isolate , Reproducible characteristic , Compatibility tissue engineering principle , Potential enhance repair many vital tissue , Uniform dose Better quality control release criterion . Beside autologous use MSC also use allogenic therapy . Several study use allo-MSC vivo experience suggest allo-MSCs reject many positive effect engraftment.MSC 's isolated various tissue , culture ex vivo , expand many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC 's appear represent homogeneous population flow cytometric measure cell-surface marker . These cell retain ability undergo vitro differentiation osteogenic , adipogenic chondrogenic lineage , even clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derive MSCs capable differentiate endothelial cell vitro later form capillary-like structure semisolid medium suggest differentiation potential MSCs restrict mesodermal lineage also transdifferentiation MSCs lineage like endothelial could realize vitro vivo8 MSCs know give rise limb-bud mesoderm ( osteoblast , chondrocytes , adipocytes , stroma cell , skeletal myoblasts ) also differentiate cell visceral mesoderm ( endothelial cell ) .9 MSCs facilitate vasculogenesis increase vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) level . After MSCs intramyocardially inject infarct zone , local VEGF level rise , vascular density regional blood flow increase , contractility improves . MSCs anti-fibrotic activity hence may excellent source tackle pulmonary fibrosis hence could explore therapeutic potential treating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . MSC 's also display membrane-bound insoluble secrete molecule involve cell attachment neighbor cell extra cellular matrix.18 This cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cell home bloodstream mesenchymal tissue .</detailed_description>
