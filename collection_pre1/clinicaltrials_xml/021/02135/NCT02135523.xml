	<brief_summary>1 . Title : The efficacy involved-field radiation therapy residual locoregionally recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer definitive treatment ; Multi-institutional phase 2 clinical trial 2 . Study period : 2014.04~2018.04 3 . Objective : To determine whether involved-field radiation therapy prove improve 2-year progression free survival residual locoregionally recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer patient definitive treatment . 4 . Patient Selection : primary epithelial ovarian cancer ( Required sample size : 70 ) 5 . Planned number patient - YUHS database 149 FIGO stage III patient treat debulking surgery adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy 2 . - Of patient , 90 patient experience locoregional failure , investigator select 44 patient could treat effectively IFRT base MDACC suggestion . - Median interval failure 9 month patient - Hypothesis ; IFRT reduce 30 % hazard progression compare patient without IFRT - Sample size ; two-sided , accrual time = 24 mo , f/u time= 36 mo . α= 0.05 , power = 0.80 Null progression-free median survival = 9 mo Alt progression-free median survival = 13 mo Calculated sample number = total 64 patient Drop rate = 10 % • Total sample number = 70 patient 6 . Radiation therapy : Participants receive involved-field radiotherapy ( external beam radiotherapy brachytherapy ) 45Gy 1.8-2.0 Gy fraction , five time per week residual locoregionally recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer definitive treatment - Target volume - direct gross disease plus high-risk clinical target volume ( CTV ) include postoperative bed prechemotherapy extent disease 1- 1.5-cm margin , exclude uninvolved clinical structure - Additional CTVs designate accord risk microscopic disease spread , proximity critical structure , risk factor complication . - Nodal CTVs include grossly involve lymph node site , extend cover adjacent uninvolved region . - Modality ; 3-dimensional conformal RT include electron , intensity-modulated RT , proton beam RT 7 . Patient assessment : Participants follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month radiation therapy 8 . Key word : ovarian cancer , involved-field radiation therapy , progression free survival</brief_summary>
