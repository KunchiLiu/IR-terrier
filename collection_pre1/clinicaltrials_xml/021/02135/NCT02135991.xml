Much less invested help community implement program quality . Although many evidence-based program exist address alcohol drug use , community face difficulty implement achieve outcome researcher . This `` gap '' resource limit , prevention complex , community often lack capacity—or knowledge , attitude , skills—needed implement `` shelf '' program well . Common way bridge gap , information dissemination , fail change practice outcomes local level part sufficiently address capacity community practitioner . Therefore , build community 's capacity method could improve quality implementation outcome .

To address aim collect data delivery utilization GTO ( e.g. , method delivery , duration , topic ) ; staff capacity implement research-based intervention ; observation program delivery ( fidelity monitoring ) ; youth participant ' use , attitude towards , alcohol marijuana via survey baseline 3 6 month follow-up ; cost PC alone PC+GTO . Analyses examine difference intervention ( PC+GTO ) control ( PC ) Sites ' capacity , PC fidelity , outcome , cost time , account cluster within site . The PREP study could expand implementation research serve model government agency support strong implementation evidence-based program wide array domain . These outcome important provide opportunity youth become healthy productive adult .</detailed_description>
