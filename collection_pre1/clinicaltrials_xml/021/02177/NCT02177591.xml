	<brief_title>Observational Study Association Between Periodontal Disease Cardiovascular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A possible association periodontal disease cardiovascular disease first hypothesize 1980s . Epidemiological study perform last 20 year show strong correlation periodontal disease cardiovascular disease . However , literature somewhat divide , study show moderate correlation others show independent ( insignificant ) correlation two . This leave gap investigator knowledge must bring together specific study . There report make suggest 52 % atherosclerotic plaque study find contain pathogen cause periodontitis . This reason bacteria focus course study . Periodontal disease , know either gingivitis periodontitis , cause presence bacteria gingival pocket mouth time cause systemic inflammation endotoxin production . Some example bacteria cause periodontal disease include Porphyromonas gingivalis Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans . These gram-negative , anaerobic bacteria able thrive sub-gingival space able successfully become establish . These two bacteria know invade oral epithelial cell , create possibility could invade epithelial cell elsewhere coronary vessel . These bacteria culture patient relative amount determined culture technique use assess prevalence periodontal disease patient . P. gingivalis special importance know find patient active periodontal disease commonly find patient without periodontal disease . It identify black pigment produce upon culture . Tryptic Soy-Serum-Bacitracin-Vancomycin ( TSBV ) Agar selective medium able isolate A. actinomycetemcomitans . The identity A. actinomycetemcomitans confirm base growth `` star-like '' colony TSBV Agar catalase positive . The relative amount bacteria determined culture use correlate level coronary artery disease base group subject assign . This basis association two condition determine . Systemic inflammation occur result release pro-inflammatory cytokine response infection . Some cytokine release , include high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Hs-CRP protein active acute phase response inflammation . Its level blood show markedly raise chronic inflammation consistently find elevate patient acute coronary syndrome . IL-1 pro-inflammatory cytokine also release result systemic inflammation . Specifically , find secrete response lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) gram-negative bacteria find elevated patient increase periodontal disease . IL-6 , like IL-1 , pro-inflammatory cytokine part acute phase response infection . It strongly correlate increase level coronary artery disease even demonstrate predictive marker mortality CAD . In addition role CAD , IL-6 also find elevated periodontal disease , create possibility basis link two disease . The aim study achieve good understand relationship periodontal disease coronary artery disease correlate severity coronary artery disease presence amount periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis A. actinomycetemcomitans . The level systemic inflammation cause pathogen coronary artery disease also assess . This determine coronary artery disease associate one specific pathogens level systemic inflammation associate condition together . Samples obtain periodontal tissue , culture , amount specify pathogens present correlate type extent patient 's cardiovascular disease . Blood test also take assess level systemic inflammation occur result periodontal disease cardiovascular disease . Subjects assign one 3 group base cardiovascular status : - Group 1 include patient known history CAD . - Group 2 include patient known history CAD without previous MI . - Group 3 include patient known history CAD previous MI . Charts patient see Cardiology clinic pre-screened member study team determine patient eligible study . Patients consented private setting cardiovascular disease history pertinent study take patient consent participate study . Clean floss use collect sample gingival fluid lower teeth patient . No measure take sterilize floss , appropriate aseptic technique include use sterile glove prevent cross contamination . Three sample collect : midline teeth , behind right leave lateral incisor , front right leave first molar . The decision sample right leave patient 's mouth randomize ( coin flip ) unless patient miss teeth one side sample must take side yield proper sample . At least 2 3 sample must obtain . These sample place 3 label ( study ID site sample ) seal vial thioglycollate broth culture 48 hour . A sample remove bottom thioglocyllate medium use pippette ( extract anaerobic bacteria ) culture specific medium presence P. gingivalis , A. actinomycetemcomitans use anaerobic precaution University Medical Center ( UMC ) microbiology laboratory . P. gingivalis culture specialize Columbia agar supplement sheep 's blood , bacitracin , colistin , nalidixic acid select isolation P. gingivalis . A. actinomycetemcomitans isolate use specialized tryptic soy-serum-bacitracin-vancomycin ( TSBV ) agar , specialize agar inhibits gram-positive gram-negative aerobe anaerobe . Each sample streak onto agar plate label study ID tooth location . The bacteria culture use quad-streak method culture 24-48 hour pathogenic bacteria identify . P. gingivalis identify base growth black pigment colony selective agar A. actinomycetemcomitans identify base growth star-like colony TSBV agar . The level periodontal disease patient assess amount growth plat , number assign quadrant bacteria grow . grow first quadrant , give number designation 1 , growth second fourth quadrant designate 2 4 respectively . Using method , level bacteria quantify , 4 designation high relative amount bacteria . The level pathogen find patient ' mouth correlate severity coronary artery disease order determine significant correlation . It also determine one pathogen correlate severity . In addition gingival sampling , small portion ( 3 mL 0.6 tsp ) patient 's blood use test hs-CRP , IL-6 , IL-1 systemic marker inflammation . The sample use take initial clinic visit patient give consent gingival sample take . The sample drawn nurse order obtain necessary test . 1 mL ( 0.2 tsp ) serum draw test ( 0.6 tsp total ) send UMC pathology lab analysis . These level compare normal value IL-1 ( 0-5 pg/mL ) IL-6 ( 5-15 pg/mL ) hs-CRP correlate base increase level . This allow determination level systemic infection cause periodontitis ( base IL-1 level ) , coronary artery disease ( base hs-CRP level ) , ( base IL-6 level ) . Individual result record statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
