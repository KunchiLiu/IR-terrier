	<brief_summary>Background : - Marijuana ( cannabis ) illegal drug . Researchers want study people reaction , attention , behavior take marijuana different way . They want learn good way detect drug person body They also want know long marijuana find blood , urine , saliva , breath . Objectives : - To learn people respond delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC , marijuana component ) body handle give different way . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 50 use marijuana . Design : - Participants screen another NIDA protocol . - This study involve 6 visit NIDA . - At first visit , participant practice task test dose session . They learn give breath saliva sample . - Dosing session 1 4 last 3 5 day . All participant admit research clinic night session . Some participant stay clinic must go home session . - At session , participant eat brownie placebo marijuana . Then smoke placebo marijuana cigarette . Some inhale placebo marijuana vaporize . - Throughout session : - Participants give urine , saliva , breath sample . Their blood take tube vein finger prick . Their vital sign check . - Participants answer questionnaire take thinking test . They also take test assess eye movement , balance , time estimation . - Participants may 5th dose session . They eat marijuana brownie test sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Cannabinoids commonly administer via smoking . Oral consumption medication , tea , oil , food also widely utilized . Additionally , cannabis vaporization follow inhalation medical illicit administration common . Differences cannabis pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics three administration rout occasional frequent cannabis smoker thoroughly characterize . This study evaluate cannabis pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics occasional frequent smoker smoke , vaporize , oral cannabis administration . &lt; TAB &gt; Study Population Up 80 healthy cannabis smoker , age 18-50 , without history adverse reaction cannabis recruit . For dose session 1-4 , ten occasional smoker ( smoke frequency great equal 2 times/month &lt; 3 times/week ) ten frequent smoker ( smoke frequency generally great equal 5times/week ) require . For optional 5th session , 8-20 participant ( regardless smoke history ) require . &lt; TAB &gt; Study Design Occasional frequent cannabis smoker recruit participate . Prior dose session , train visit study procedure . Sessions 1-4 3 4 day occasional frequent cannabis smoker , respectively , study design double blind , double dummy , randomize , crossover , placebo-controlled . In session , participant consume placebo active oral ( baked brownie ) cannabis ( 6.9 % 9-tetrahydrocannabinol [ THC ] ) dose follow either placebo active smoke vaporized cannabis . Only one active dose administer dose session . Whole blood , oral fluid , urine , dry blood spot , breath collect throughout session . Due large THC body burden store tissue , collect biological specimen longer period frequent cannabis smoker occasional cannabis smoker . An optional 5th dose session offer participant receive single oral cannabis dose pharmacokinetic monitoring . The placebo cannabis plant material low THC concentration . As expect active brownie dose might result low THC oral fluid contamination , necessary active brownie THC dose follow placebo vaporizer smoke cannabis . Occasional smoker may stay discharged session , include 4th optional 5th dose session , dose must exceed self-reported intake frequency . Frequent smoker must discharge least 72 h dose session 1-4 , must stay unit end session 4 session 5 choose participate . The difference requirement occasional frequent smoker participate optional 5th dose due potential confound low THC concentration frequent smoker might permit detection low THC concentration consumption low oral THC dose . Occasional cannabis smoker reside close research unit approximately 72 h dose session 1-4 , approximately 66 h dose session 5 . Frequent cannabis smoker reside close research unit approximately 90 h dose session 1-3 ( 4 participate optional session 5 ) . If frequent smoker choose participate dose session 5 , remain unit approximately 162 h session 4 5 . Participants complete battery subjective , objective , neurocognitive test dose . Subjective effect assess visual analog scale . Objective measurement include physiological measurement , expire carbon monoxide , redden conjunctiva test measure psychomotor skill cognitive function . &lt; TAB &gt; Outcome Parameters Primary outcome measure include subjective objective assessment , performance neurocognitive task , cannabinoid concentration whole blood , oral fluid , urine , dry blood spot , breath . Correlations cannabinoid concentration whole blood , dry blood spot , oral fluid , breath investigate , Oral Fluid Working Group Partnership Clean Competition oral fluid screen algorithm evaluate , pharmacokinetic profile alternative cannabinoids characterize . Secondary investigation include compare cannabinoid stability dry blood spot whole blood , evaluate World Anti-Doping Agency urine 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC decision limit , characterize performance Alere DDS2 on-site oral fluid screen device , evaluate effect acute cannabis administration leptin appetitive peptides. &lt; TAB &gt;</detailed_description>
