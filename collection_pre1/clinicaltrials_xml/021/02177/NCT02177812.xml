	<brief_summary>This study phase I , open-label study determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) regimen orally administer lysine specific demethylase 1 ( LSD1 ) inhibitor GSK2879552 . The recommend dose regimen select base safety , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) profile observed treatment subject relapsed/refractory AML . The study consist two part . Part 1 identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or RP2D use dose-escalation procedure . Dose escalation guide Neuenschwander-continual reassessment method ( N-CRM ) . PK/PD expansion cohort also include Part 1 characterize range biologically effective dos assess PD marker obtain additional PK data . Part 2 explore safety , tolerability , clinical activity GSK2879552 RP2D subject AML .</brief_summary>
