	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-finding evaluation efficacy safety OCA subject PSC . Approximately 75 subject provide write informed consent meet inclusion none exclusion criterion randomize 1 3 treatment group follow : 1.5 mg titrate 3 mg OCA , 5 mg titrate 10 mg OCA , placebo , 1:1:1 ratio . Subjects administer investigational product ( IP ) orally , daily 2 consecutive 12-week period . For first 12 week , subject 's dose 1.5 mg OCA , 5 mg OCA , placebo . After 12 week , subject 's dose titrate follow , provide limit safety tolerability concern opinion investigator , maintain trial blind : 1.5 mg OCA treatment group titrate 3 mg , 5 mg OCA treatment group titrate 10 mg OCA , placebo group remain placebo . Double-blind treatment continue 12 week dose . Any subject whose dose titrate , due safety tolerability concern , remain start treatment ( 1.5 mg OCA , 5 mg OCA , placebo ) remainder double-blind phase Week 24 . Randomization stratify presence absence concomitant ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) use total bilirubin level ( ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal [ ULN ] &gt; 1.5x ULN &lt; 2.5x ULN ) .</detailed_description>
