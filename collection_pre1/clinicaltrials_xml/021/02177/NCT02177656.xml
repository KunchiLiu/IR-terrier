	<detailed_description>MITI-HF prospective , single blind , pilot randomize single-site trial . The target sample size 65 participant ; however , account estimate 35 % attrition rate , target number recruitment 100 participant . We calculate target sample size base 2:1 randomization ( intervention : control ) 90 % power ( 5 % alpha ) detect difference 80 % versus 50 % ( intervention control group ) score 70 , cut-off adequate self-care three month two group . The power analysis perform use G*Power confirm PASS . Randomization intervention usual care group occur informed consent form sign New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Functional Class score .
