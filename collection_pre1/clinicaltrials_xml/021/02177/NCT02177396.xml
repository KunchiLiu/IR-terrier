	<brief_summary>The primary aim trial compare effect telmisartan valsartan lower ambulatory diastolic and/or systolic blood pressure last six hour dose interval . Secondary variable include change baseline diastolic systolic blood pressure time 24-hour ABPM profile , change baseline seat trough diastolic systolic blood pressure measure manual cuff , responder rate . Assessment safety also consider . Adverse event use concomitant therapy monitor study visit . Blood pressure heart rate collect visit . Physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) laboratory test complete trial well .</brief_summary>
