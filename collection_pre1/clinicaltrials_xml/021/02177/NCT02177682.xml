	<criteria>Written inform consent provide . Japanese female male age 20 year old ( time consent obtain ) . Histologically confirm diagnosis relapse multiple myeloma . Performance score 0 1 accord ECOG scale . Relapsed least 1 line systemic therapy . The preparative regimen ( without total body irradiation ) subsequent autologous stem cell rescue use autologous stem cell transplant consider one line therapy . Able swallow retain oral medication . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must prior vasectomy agree use adequate contraception time first dose study drug three month last dose study drug . A female subject eligible participate : ( A ) Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant ) : Premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ unclear , simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone &gt; 40 milliinternational unit ( MIU ) /milliliter ( mL ) oestradiol &lt; 40 picograms ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 140 picomoles [ pmol ] /L ) require confirmation ] . ( B ) Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt must discontinue HRT confirm postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Following confirmation , resume HRT study without use contraceptive method . ( C ) Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior enrolment , agree use adequate contraception screen four week last dose study drug . Note : The recommended contraceptive method abstinence sexual intercourse , use intrauterine device/system , vasectomy , use condom spermicidal agent . An oral contraceptive drug offer reliable contraceptive method drugdrug interaction may occur . Adequate organ system function define protocol Subjects history autologous stem cell transplant eligible provide follow criterion meet : transplant complete &gt; 180 day prior enrolment ; active infection ( e.g . cytomegalovirus , varicellazoster virus ) ; meet remainder eligibility criterion outline protocol . Chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy antimyeloma therapy within 28 day prior enrolment . In addition , toxicity ( except alopecia ) recover &lt; =Grade 1 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCICTCAE ) , version 4.0 . Use investigational drug within 30 day five halflives , whichever longer . History allogenic stem cell transplant . For patient history autologous stem cell transplant , inclusion criterion 10 must meet . History PI3K/AKT inhibitor . Current use prohibit medication subject require medication treatment afuresertib , well subject meet protocol specify meal dietary restriction Current use oral corticosteroid , except inhaled topical use . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus diet , exercise medicinal therapy include insulin , fast serum glucose &gt; =130 mg/dL ( &gt; =7.28 millimoles [ mmol ] /L ) . Use anticoagulant low dose ( prophylactic ) anticoagulant subject whose Prothrombin time ( PT ) /international normalization ratio ( INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) &lt; =1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Presence active Gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease condition could affect GI absorption ( e.g . malabsorption syndrome ) predispose subject GI ulceration . Any major surgery require hospitalization within last four week . Any serious unstable preexist medical , psychiatric , condition ( include lab abnormality ) could interfere subject safety obtain informed consent . Active infection require parenteral oral antiinfective treatment . Evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , unstable uncompensated respiratory , hepatic , renal , cardiac disease ) . Central nervous system malignancy , primary metastatic . Diagnosis treatment history another malignancy within 2 year , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . History known infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Positive hepatitis B surface ( HBs ) antigen hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . If negative HBs antigen positive either hepatitis B core ( HBc ) HBs antibody , HBV DNA need negative . Positive hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; 480 msec patient bundle branch block . The QTc QT interval correct heart rate accord Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) . Note : The QTc base single average QTc value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period . Other clinically significant ECG abnormality , include 2nd 3rd degree atrioventricular block . History myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome ( include unstable angina ) , coronary angioplasty stenting bypass graft within past six month .
