	<brief_summary>Revision surgery total hip knee arthroplasty ongoing issue due increase number primary surgery . Patients seek physician due pain . The cause divide loosening , infection chronic pain . Some operated suspicion chronic infection . However , postoperative microbiological testing always correlate suspicion operation may superfluous . The objective employ highly advanced diagnostic algorithm base state art diagnostic technique order improve basis preoperative diagnosis . Through approach treatment give accord causal problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Pain , Inflammation Infection After Joint Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim project improve preoperative diagnosis infection persistent pain patient prosthesis-related problem . Prosthesis infection chronic nature . Recent research show one important explanation formation encapsulate 'bacterial community ' surface prosthesis , bacteria well protected antibiotic treatment . Surgery therefore necessary patient group . But important make diagnosis accurate currently today . In contrast , patient persistent pain , indication infection prosthetic loosening , best serve avoid surgery , instead receive treatment direct chronic pain condition . Based pain research carry Aalborg University , understand chronic pain treatment principle would beneficial patient group develop . The investigator want : 1. describe postoperative course specific serologic marker primary secondary total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . 2. describe bacteriologic diversity revision THA TKA use cultivation technique molecular biological analysis comprehensive fluorescence in-situ hybridization ( FISH ) , clone phylogeny , quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) gene expression profile . 3. describe pain sensitization new diagnostic technology patient stem loosen , suffer infection pain . 4. apply new diagnostic algorithm diagnosis infection pain follow THA TKA , include pain assessment , diagnostic X-ray , bone scintigraphy , PET scan , percutaneous biopsy , specific serologic parameter molecular biological analysis . 5. describe effect diagnostic algorithm , compare descriptive retrospective cohort patient undergone revision THA TKA .</detailed_description>
