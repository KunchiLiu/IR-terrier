	<brief_summary>Nausea common distressing experience often precede vomit . Amongst symptoms emanate gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract nausea consider somewhat unique , one hand represent normal , highly conserve , physiological response ingest toxin yet may indicate pathology . Nausea may also arise consequence pharmaco- chemotherapeutic intervention . Nausea negatively impact quality life , adherence treatment cause discontinuation development novel compound . Experimentally , nausea induce human use visually induce motion stimulus . Previously develop 10-minute motion video landscape rotate see perspective subject stand Westminster Bridge , London . The tilted rotating view visual display make subject perceive spinning round round spot tilt away centre gravity due circular vection . This motion video induce nausea approximately 50 % healthy participant cause reduction cardiac vagal tone , validated measure parasympathetic nervous system branch autonomic nervous system . We therefore evaluate role external transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation visually induced motion sickness .</brief_summary>
