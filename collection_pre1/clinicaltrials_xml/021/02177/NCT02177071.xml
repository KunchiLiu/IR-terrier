Primary objective To assess effect two withdrawal strategy two year patient stable remission than6 month combination therapy infliximab antimetabolite , demonstrate continue combination infliximab antimetabolites continued monotherapy infliximab superior antimetabolites alone maintain sustain steroid-free clinical remission , antimetabolites alone non-inferior regard mean time spend remission 3.2 . Secondary objective - To identify baseline predictive factor relapse three study group . - To assess ability blood CRP fecal calprotectin predict short term relapse three group . - To assess time spent inclinical remission three group . - To assess rate treatment failure three study group . - To assess time treatment failure three study group . - To assess progression bowel damage three group . - To assess safety efficacy infliximab retreatment antimetabolite group . - To assess safety three study group . - To assess health relate quality life three study group . - To assess direct indirect cost three study group . - To assess evolution blood CRP fecal calprotectin three study group . - To assess evolution infliximab trough level ATI two infliximab schedule maintenance group . - To assess genetic association various clinical biological outcome . - To assess impact 6TGN level various clinical biological outcome purine treat patient 4 . STUDY POPULATION 4.1 . Selection study population Patients include steroid free remission least 6 month schedule infliximab/antimetabolites combination therapy least 1 year , schedule infliximab treatment administrate every 8 week last 6 month . 4.2 . Source recruitment Patients recruit participate GETAID IBD-centers France , Belgium SOIBD IBD-centers Sweden , select centre USA . 4.3 . Inclusion criterion To eligible follow criterion must meet : - Diagnosis Crohn 's disease . - Male female , age &gt; 18 year . - Currently treat combination therapy infliximab anti-metabolites luminal Crohn 's disease . - Combined therapy schedule infliximab anti-metabolites least 12 month . - Scheduled administration infliximab 5 mg/Kg every 8 week last 6 month . - Antimetabolites administer stable dosage last 6 month : least 1 mg/Kg 2 mg/Kg mercaptopurine azathioprine , respectively , high tolerate dosage intolerance standard dose ; least 15 mg/week subcutaneously methotrexate . - Patients steroid free clinical remission least 6 month accord retrospective assessment patient ' file . - CDAI &lt; 150 baseline . - A contraceptive whole study - Patients able understand information provide give write informed consent study 4.4 . Exclusion criterion - Patients present severe acute delay reaction infliximab . - Perianal fistula main indication infliximab treatment - Active perianal/abdominal fistula time inclusion , define active drainage - Patients ostomy ileoanal pouch - Pregnancy plan pregnancy study - Inability follow study procedure judge investigator - Non-compliant subject . - Participation another therapeutic study</detailed_description>
