	<detailed_description>This randomize , blind study . Following REB approval , eligible patient elect undergo TKA identify either PI co-investigators , approach orthopaedic outpatient clinic discus enrolment study . Patients enrol meet prerequisite inclusion criterion sign informed consent . Patients randomize undergo TKA use PSI , conventional TKA . The randomization sequence computer generate use block five . Preoperative Assessment At baseline , patient complete Knee Society Score ( KSS ) , Short-Form 12 ( SF-12 ) Questionnaire , Western McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) questionnaire , European Quality Life Scale Index ( EQ-5D ) . The EQ-5D validate , reliable , feasible outcome measure provide utility index . This utility index allow quality adjust life year calculate follow intervention . The questionnaire 5-item standardize generic measure health relate quality life include domain mobility , self-care , usual activity , pain discomfort , anxiety depression . Each item score use 3-point response scale combination response choice describe health state ( result 243 possible health state ) . Each health state convert utility value range 0 ( bad ) 1.0 ( best ) use exist preference valuation data [ 22 ] . It valuate Canadian American population use assess health-related quality life [ 23 , 24 ] . We calculate patient 's quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) . QALYs incorporate length life quality life single measure calculate multiply utility value length time spend health state . Additionally , clinical assessment complete , include knee range motion , ligamentous assessment , evaluate soft tissue contracture . Finally , patient 3-foot coronal sagittal stand radiograph low extremity institution . The stand mechanical axis involve limb calculate . Skyline view also perform part radiographic analysis . In order appropriate preoperative planning , patient randomize PSI undergo compute tomography ( CT ) scan surgical limb use TruMatch TM scan protocol . Following modification make treat surgeon , personalize patient instrument manufacture standard fashion . Intraoperative Assessment On day surgery , patient receive either spinal general anesthetic base recommendation anesthetist , personal preference . A non-sterile tourniquet apply operative limb . A mid-line skin incision follow medial parapatellar arthrotomy use exposure . The femoral tibial cut make use conventional instrumentation control group , TruMatch TM Personalized Solutions Instruments treatment group . Soft tissue balancing , include release removal osteophyte , perform discretion surgeon . The Attune TM component implant use cement fixation . At time cement implant , patient receive parenteral weight-based dose tranexamic acid ( 20 mg /kg ) , provide contra-indications . Prior closure , patient receive intra-articular injection anesthetic cocktail . The parapatellar arthrotomy subcutaneous tissue skin close standard fashion . Post-operatively , patient receive deep-vein thrombosis prophylaxis 14-days post-operatively . They also receive 24 hour post-operative parenteral antibiotic . They assess physiotherapy , weight-bearing range motion exercise begin post-operative day 0 . Patients discharge hospital reach appropriate rehabilitative milestone outline institution . Postoperative Assessment Patients routine follow-up surgeon 2- , 6- , 12-weeks , follow 1-year every year thereafter . Three-foot coronal full-length sagittal standing radiograph , well skyline view involve knee , take 1-year postoperative visit . We calculate mechanical axis operative limb base postoperative radiographic assessment . The patient complete KSS , SF-12 , WOMAC , EQ-5D questionnaires 6-week , 12-week , 1-year visit . These outcome questionnaire collect prospectively 5-years 10-years post-operatively institution 's database . Assessors clinical outcome mechanical axis blind surgical intervention ( conventional instrumentation versus PSI TKA ) . Patients also receive health care resource use diary complete follow-up interval order collect outpatient direct indirect cost associate TKA . Costs Our institution 's costs-accounting department provide information regard operating room cost , implant cost , cost associate routine care nursing , medication , investigation . Physician-related cost acquire Ontario Health Insurance Plan bill protocol . The outpatient cost analysis diary capture direct , non-medical cost associate TKA ( see Appendix C ) . The data report Canadian dollar fiscal year in-hospital cost data derive . A sample database currently employ unrelated study provide require . Cost-Utility Analysis Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio ( ICUR ) The ICUR represent ratio incremental cost incremental utility . The incremental cost represent additional cost PSI group compare conventional group . The cost include direct ( operate room , hospital stay , rehabilitation , medication , investigation ) indirect cost ( informal care , time lose productivity ) . Similarly , incremental utility mean difference QALY group . Net Benefit Regression We use net benefit regression ( NBR ) framework estimate incremental net benefit ( INB ) PSI [ 25 ] . An intervention consider cost-effective INB great zero . The net benefit regression method also provide mean adjust potentially confound factor therefore allow great statistical efficiency provide precise estimate INB . We include follow covariates regression model : baseline utility score , severity osteoarthritis , age number comorbidities . To characterize statistical uncertainty around estimate INB calculate 95 % confidence interval , cost-effectiveness acceptability curve ( CEAC ) . Modeling To determine cost-effectiveness new intervention , economic decision model appropriate multiple exist source evidence answer question ( e.g . randomize trial , cohort study , registry , etc . ) forecast cost and/or outcomes beyond follow-up period clinical trial . Given PSI relatively new technology , long-term data available accurately determine survival implant rate revision . To accurately answer question , prospectively follow cohort long-term determine survival rate implant .</detailed_description>
