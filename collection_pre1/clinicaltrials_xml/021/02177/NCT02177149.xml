	<brief_summary>The central hypothesis use DBS ( Deep Brain Stimulation ) clinical decision support system individual patient management enable considerable time saving compare standard care . This hypothesis formulate pilot study show dramatic decrease DBS program time compare standard care clinician use iPad-based decision support system ( 99 % time save 4 hour 2 minute .

	<detailed_description>In case subject fail maintain adequate control symptoms medication alone . The Diagnosis PD ( Parkinson 's Disease ) decision DBS qualifies subject enrollment . Subjects would select require DBS programming . The investigator prospectively enroll 20 PD DBS patient Froedtert Movement Disorders Center ( surgical target : subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) internal segment globus pallidus ( GPi ) . Post-operative care , patient randomize 1/1 standard care use clinical decision support system . The DBS RN use ImageVis3D Mobile app iPad program DBS system , software interact Froedtert image system . The study team use identify image provide Froedtert PACS system , de identifies , add study code . The image load software system use identify leads location . The Patients assess 6 month start initial DBS programming session . Importantly , investigator anticipate clinical decision support tool provide final DBS setting , anticipate approach obviate need motor exam . The clinical decision support system help nurse choose good initial setting explore around initial setting . The investigator measure time spend DBS program patient group . The investigator capture program session duration , number programming session total time spend DBS program . The investigator compare total time spend program standard care versus intervention group .</detailed_description>
