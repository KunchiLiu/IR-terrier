	<detailed_description>Study design A double-blind , randomize , crossover , clinical trial split-mouth design carry . This study receive approval Human Research Ethics Committee institution carry ( process number : 001.0.097.000-08 ) conduct compliance Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ( CONSORT ) statement . All patient sign statement inform consent agree participate study . Sample size pilot study The sample size estimate use computational program . Thirty patient submit third molar surgery pilot study determine sample size . This step necessary due lack similar study literature . Calculations perform specific program take consideration variable , 95 % confidence interval , 80 % test power 5 % error . At end study , 120 patient analyze ( 40 group ) , total 240 surgery . Sample selection One hundred twenty eight individual 18 40 year age select participation present study submission maxillary mandibular third molar extraction bilaterally Department Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery . Each patient submit two surgery . The third molar ( maxillary mandibular ) need degree impaction side . Three group form : Group A receive diazepam placebo , Group B receive midazolam placebo Group C receive midazolam diazepam . For purpose randomization blind surgeon researcher charge analyze result , group renominated Groups 1 , 2 3 . The randomization procedure carry researcher directly involved surgery evaluation . Sequentially numbered , seal , opaque envelope use , contain combination substance side submit first surgery . For patient , researcher open envelope , inform main investigator surgeon side operate , administer substance patient . The second surgery perform contralateral side administration second substance . Blinding perform avoid awareness regard substance administer surgery . For , pill fabricate out color standardize size Pernambuco Pharmaceutical Laboratory ( Brazil ) package recipient color . The recipient denominate 1 , 2 3 . Surgical procedure medication As patient classify healthy , prophylactic use antibiotic perform prior surgery prevention bacterial endocarditis , recommend American Heart Association . All patient rinse mouths 0.12 % chlorhexidine one minute prior surgery reduce bacterial population oral cavity . Moreover , patient instruct take two 4-mg pill dexamethasone one hour prior surgery . The use corticosteroid preoperative period minimize occurrence postoperative swell reduces risk trismus.13 The substance ( diazepam , midazolam placebo ) administer orally 45 minute prior surgical procedure . As substance mask , neither surgeon patient aware substance give ( double-blind study ) .</detailed_description>
