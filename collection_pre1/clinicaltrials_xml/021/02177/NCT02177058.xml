	<brief_summary>This project directly address national imperative innovative strategy improve care Medicare beneficiaries reduce health care cost . The overall objective propose project improve care older individual reside nurse home ( NHs ) , time reduce unnecessary Medicare expenditures . This goal accomplish test quality improvement program design reduce number avoidable hospitalization NH resident randomize controlled trial . The primary hypothesis test : Hypothesis1 : Interventions Reduce Acute Care Transfers ( INTERACT ) implementation NHs great reduction hospitalization rate control monitor NHs 12-month implementation compare 12-month baseline period . Hypothesis 2 : Reductions Medicare expenditures hospitalization INTERACT implementation NHs great estimate cost implement intervention . Hypothesis 3 : The effect INTERACT hospitalization rate great among patient Medicare skilled benefit post-acute care , long-stay patient . Hypothesis 4 : The effect INTERACT hospitalization rate greatest among NHs high vs. low intensity ( fidelity ) implement program . Hypothesis 5 : There great reduction measure hospitalization condition define `` potentially preventable '' transfer hospitalization . Hypothesis 6 : Implementation INTERACT associate worsen relevant quality measure participate NHs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hospitalizations Nursing Home ( NH ) resident frequent associate numerous complication increase health care cost . Previous research suggest many two-thirds hospitalization may avoidable . Anticipated change Medicare reimbursement reduce financial incentive favor hospitalization , could result reduce care quality NH staff train clinical tool manage resident NH acute change occur . INTERACT ( Interventions Reduce Acute Care Transfers ) quality improvement program utilize tool base established clinical guideline . The tool target three key strategy reduce potentially avoidable hospitalization : 1 ) preventing condition become severe enough require acute hospital care ; 2 ) managing select acute condition NH ; 3 ) improve advance care plan resident among palliative comfort care plan , rather acute hospitalization , may appropriate . Preliminary research involve 30 NHs demonstrate 17 % reduction hospitalization compare six-month period previous year . The cost intervention $ 7,700 ; project saving Medicare reduce hospital admission 100-bed NH $ 125,000/year . While result promise , effectiveness INTERACT reduce hospitalization remains test controlled trial . The propose project therefore involve interdisciplinary team experience NH researcher conduct randomize control trial test implementation INTERACT program . NHs randomize INTERACT intervention participate 3-months training , receive support 12-month implementation period experience nurse practitioner regular multi-NH conference call , monthly individual call , as-needed telephonic email communication . The effect implement INTERACT intervention hospitalization rate compare randomly assign group usual care control NHs group self-monitor hospitalization rate . The hypothesis test : 1 ) INTERACT implementation NHs great reduction hospitalization rate control monitor NHs 12-month implementation compare 12-month baseline period ; 2 ) reduction Medicare expenditures hospitalization INTERACT intervention NHs exceed estimate cost implement intervention . The specific aim project : 1 . Determine effectiveness implement INTERACT quality improvement program reduce hospitalization rate . 2 . Calculate difference Medicare expenditures hospitalization NHs implement INTERACT , usual care control group , NHs monitoring hospitalization rate group .</detailed_description>
