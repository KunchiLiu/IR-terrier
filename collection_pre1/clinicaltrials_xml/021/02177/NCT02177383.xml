	<detailed_description>There conflict evidence effect dietary supplementation polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) athletic performance . The described effect PUFAs fat metabolism may modulate expression activity transcription factor gene , suppress express gene associate synthesis oxidation fat oxidative stress inflammation . The investigator ' work hypothesis base polyunsaturated fatty acid , give pro-oxidative character also action transcription factor modulate antioxidant response oxidative damage induce physical activity . In field professional sport leisure use food / antioxidant belief element prevent muscle damage establish . Most study athlete supplement antioxidant nutrient reveal significant effect physical performance , show supplement protect tissue damage induce exercise . Recent study report 35 % Spanish people eat diet low low quality , clearly show 10 % Spaniards poor intake ( &lt; 2/3 IDR ) riboflavin ( men ) , folate ( woman ) , vitamin C , vitamin A , vitamin D vitamin E. The overall objective study establish situation improve athletic performance study oxidative balance manipulation feed pattern consumption nutritional supplement investigate involve mechanism . The aim study establish scientific basis design functional food improve athletic performance health avoid negative consequence oxidative damage induce overexertion .</detailed_description>
