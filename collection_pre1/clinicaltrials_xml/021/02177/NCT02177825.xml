	<brief_title>Study Imatinib Mesylate Neurofibromatosis Type I Patients Aged 2 21 With Plexiform Neurofibromas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical objective 1 . Demonstrate clinical benefit imatinib pediatric patient population progress metabolically active plexiform neurofibroma ( NF ) 2 . Demonstrate need pursue treatment year responder imatinib Biological study objectives 1 . Identify biological marker plexiform neurofibroma progression response treatment 2 . Identify biological marker mast cell response imatinib , give mast cell require tumorigenesis target imatinib Imaging study objectives Using 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron Emission Tomography ( FDG PET/CT ) : 1 . Identify image characteristic progress plexiform neurofibromas 2 . Assess role F18-FDG PET/CT comparison CT/MRI evaluate response imatinib Â¸ Pharmacological study 1 . Evaluate trough plasma level imatinib active metabolite ( NDMIL N-desmethyl imatinib ) achieve pediatric population 2 . Identify potential correlation imatinib ( NDMI ) trough level achieve clinical response</detailed_description>
