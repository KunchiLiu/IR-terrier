	<brief_summary>This field study design may implement individual administer raxibacumab treatment anthrax post exposure prophylaxis include sporadic case , small anthrax incident and/or mass event . This study design describe clinical effectiveness ( include course illness survival ) , safety profile , raxibacumab pharmacokinetics ( PK ) patient treat raxibacumab part clinical care follow exposure B. anthracis . Study data sample PK investigational research collect prospectively extent possible pre-specified time point . However , logistical complexity would likely accompany mass anthrax event , data study anticipate collect retrospectively . During mass anthrax event scavenge blood sample utilize possible maximize sample analysis PK investigational parameter . Therefore , retrospective prospective data collection allow protocol order maximize amount information obtain subject administer raxibacumab . This field study first opportunity collect data B. anthracis-exposed patient treat raxibacumab , good understand clinical benefit safety drug inform patient care treatment choice management anthrax</brief_summary>
