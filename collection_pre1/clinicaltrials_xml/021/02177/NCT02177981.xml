	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause death worldwide . Patients severe CAD often treat coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) . Novel treatment strategy need pursue respond continuous increase risk profile contemporary CABG patient . Surgical myocardial revascularization commonly perform use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Neurological impairment follow CABG may take form new-onset motor deficit postoperative cognitive dysfunction . The former rare , potentially devastate . Conversely , decline attention , memory fine motor skill frequently document . Ischemic precondition phenomenon endogenous protective response organ ischemia , trigger brief cycle nonlethal ischemia reperfusion tissue know resistant ischemic insult . In clinical practice remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) achieve inflict short period ischemia intermittent restitution flow upper extremity . This intervention show effective reduction myocardial injury cardiac surgical patient . The hypothesis test research proposal RIPC decrease extent postoperative neurological injury follow CABG . In research project , 70 patient schedule elective CABG recruit single center . They randomly allocate either undergo RIPC ( intervention arm ) sham procedure ( control arm ) . Inflating blood pressure cuff 200 mmHg 5 min induce RIPC , thereby induce brief period ischemia . This follow 5-minute arm reperfusion . In total , three cycle arm ischemia reperfusion induced fashion . All patient undergo pre- post-procedural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain , well neurocognitive testing . The array MRI tool use quantification brain injury include fluid attenuate inversion recovery , diffusion weight susceptibility weight imaging , couple rest state functional MRI .

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) effective management complex coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) commonly employ achieve still bloodless field , facilitate creation technically impeccable coronary anastomosis . Multiple adverse effect stem exposure blood non-endothelial surface contrast clear benefit CPB . Neurological damage remain one dreaded complication follow CABG . While incidence new focal motor deficit low , postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) see commonly . The increase risk profile contemporary CABG patient make neuroprotective strategy progressively important . Ischemic precondition endogenous protective response trigger brief episode nonlethal ischemia reperfusion . In clinical practice remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) achieve induce short period ischemia upper extremity , follow restitution flow . This non-pharmacological strategy induce ischemic tolerance cost-free non-invasive , potentially wide clinical applicability . The `` Impact Remote Ischemic Preconditioning precede Coronary Artery bypass Grafting induce nEuroprotection ( RIPCAGE ) trial '' recruit 70 patient schedule elective CABG single academic center . The hypothesis test research proposal RIPC decrease extent postoperative neuronal damage lead reduction POCD among CABG patient . Specifically , investigator aim determine whether RIPC reduce magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detectable brain damage attenuate neurocognitive decline universally see patient CABG . The primary composite outcome consist documentation new ischemic lesion brain MRI , impairment brain connectivity resting-state functional MRI ( rs-fMRI ) , POCD . The secondary endpoint follow : 1 . Volumetric quantification area new diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) hyperintensity individual patient . 2 . Changes pre- postoperative rs-fMRI express continuous variable subsequently compare among intervention control arm . 3 . Percent decline individual neurocognitive test 4 . Troponin T release postoperative day 1 5 . Incidence major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACCE ) 3 month postoperatively . MACCE composite endpoint consist cardiovascular mortality , stroke , non-fatal myocardial infarction rehospitalization ischemia . Patients randomly allocate 1:1 ratio either receive RIPC intervention ( control group ) . In intervention arm , transient upper extremity ischemia induce induction anesthesia inflate blood pressure cuff 200 mmHg 5 min , follow 5 min cuff deflation . This sequence repeat 3 time . Patients control group also blood pressure cuff place , inflate . All patient undergo preoperative neurocognitive testing couple baseline brain MRI . The neurocognitive evaluation consist Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) test Trail Making Test ( TMT ) . Decreased cognitive function test define individual decrease least 1 standard deviation group baseline mean test . POCD define decrease two test . The patient repeat neurocognitive evaluation prior discharge hospital . Standard MRI sequence perform patient . DWI utilized volumetric analysis brain tissue exhibit stigma ischemic injury . The timing apparent diffusion coefficient quantification standardize postoperative day 7 , normalizes time . Additional MRI sequence include susceptibility weight imaging ( SWI ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . Resting state functional MRI perform order investigate coordination activity across brain network . Pre- postprocedural rs-fMRI data subsequently compare . Disruption connectivity neural circuit induce operation thereby objectivized . Patients follow total 3 month , time adverse event record adjudicated independent clinical event committee .</detailed_description>
