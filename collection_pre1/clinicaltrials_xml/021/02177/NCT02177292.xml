	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect ( good bad ) use new technology allow precise delivery radiation . These new technology Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) Image Guided Radiation Therapy ( IGRT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Lymph Node Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy Hypofractionated Prostate ( SIB )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study treat physician deliver high dose radiation pelvic lymph node 56 Gy ( Gy/Gray = measure amount radiation ) time give boost ( additional ) radiation prostate ( 70 Gy ) . The study evaluate response cancer side effect radiation pelvic lymph node prostate . It hop new technology : 1. allow high daily dose radiation tumor pelvic node 2. avoid nearby normal tissue organ like rectum bladder 3. prevent cancer spread come back</detailed_description>
