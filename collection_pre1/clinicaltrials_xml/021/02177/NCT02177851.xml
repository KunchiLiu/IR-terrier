	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency ( ID ) without anaemia ( IDA ) major public health problem worldwide , especially woman reproductive age young child . Iron supplementation effective strategy prevent treat ID IDA . There lack data iron bioavailability different supplementation regimen optimize bioavailability cost-effective patient-friendly way . The daily supplementation 1-4 mg Fe/kg body weight 3 month report effective method rapidly increase iron store subject ID IDA . In IDA patient , medical practitioner often prescribe supplementation regimens 120 mg iron per day split 2 dos 60 mg iron , argue split would increase iron bioavailability compare one single high dose . However , scientific evidence assumption ; contrary , result recent study suggest iron bioavailability second supplementation dose iron first supplementation dose iron impair due increase hepcidin level . To address bioavailability issue , present study determine iron absorption 120 mg iron administer 3 consecutive day compare 2 dos 60 mg iron per day administer 3 consecutive day . The investigator hypothesize iron bioavailability single daily dose low 2 dos . By measure also hepcidin , study provide important insight iron bioavailability single dose iron amount iron split two dos ( b.i.d . administration ) .</brief_summary>
