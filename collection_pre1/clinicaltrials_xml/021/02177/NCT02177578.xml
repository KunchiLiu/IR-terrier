	<brief_summary>In study patient treat 6 week radiation therapy plus temozolomide chemotherapy accord standard care . However , radiation treatment plan modify deliver high routine radiation dose subventricular zone area brain contains stem cell scientist believe may contribute glioblastoma recurrence . The purpose study see tumor control long period time patient treat modified radiation technique patient treat standard radiation therapy plus temozolomide chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subventricular Zone ( SVZ ) Temozolomide Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There pre-clinical data suggest neural progenitor cell subventricular zone may play role glioblastoma recurrence . Retrospective study human suggest potentially improve survival patient receive high dos radiation subventricular zone compare patient receive low radiation dos area . The purpose study prospectively examine progression free survival patient newly diagnose glioblastoma treat adjuvant temozolomide plus radiation treatment plan intentionally prescribes radiation dose tumor subventricular zone compare patient treated standard radiation therapy . 3 patient every 4 treat modify study radiation treatment 1 patient every 4 receive standard radiation treatment plan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient must newly diagnose , histologically confirm GBM . Patient must undergo gross total resection , subtotal resection , biopsy extent resection determine treat neurosurgeon , must begin radiation within 12 week procedure . Patients must receive previous irradiation brain . Patient must least 18 year age since diagnosis GBM patient younger 18 rare accurate evaluation neurocognitive function would require different battery examination employ study . ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patient must schedule receive temozolomide concurrent follow radiation ( temozolomide may start late due insurance reason , insufficient count , reason ) . If woman childbearing potential , negative urine serum pregnancy test must demonstrate prior treatment . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation 12 week follow study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study inform treat physician immediately . Patient must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . All patient must inform investigational nature study must give write informed consent accordance institutional federal guideline . Radiation therapy must begin within 12 week surgery .
