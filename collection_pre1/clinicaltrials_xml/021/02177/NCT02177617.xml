	<brief_summary>This study aim compare Botox injection without Physical Therapy session Botox injection combine Physical Therapy session treatment Cervical Dystonia . It expect Botox combine Physical Therapy improve Cervical Dystonia symptom quality life Botox alone .

	<detailed_description>The study recruit primary cervical dystonia patient ( age 18-80 ) stable Allergan botulinum toxin type A ( Botox ) . Patients randomize receive typical Botox injection alone , physical therapy . At Baseline , disease characteristic ( measure Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale , TWSTRS , Clinical Global Impression Severity , CGIS ) measure , along quality life ( Short Health 36 Survey Form 36 , SF-36 ) . One subscale TWSTRS videotape later evaluate blind movement disorder specialist . A pain scale also complete range head motion measure use device similar protractor ( call goniometer ) . An individualized Botox injection administer , well transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) measure neuroplasticity , ability brain make new connection . If randomize receive physical therapy , participant also receive instruction perform physical therapy exercise five time per week physical therapist specialize movement disorder . The investigator call weekly check participant exercise program . The procedure outline also perform 5 week past baseline , 12 week ( except Botox injection , give baseline 12 week ) .</detailed_description>
