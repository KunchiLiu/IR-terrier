	<brief_summary>The relevant factor predict morbidity mortality liver resection ability remnant liver regenerate . The investigator recently demonstrate serotonin thrombospondin-1 , two growth factor abundantly store platelet , seem play critical role liver regeneration patient liver resection . The investigator aim gain precise insight concern relevance platelet platelet derived growth factor liver regeneration human . The investigator focus specific alpha-granula release key regulator postoperative LR . Using peri- intraoperative blood tissue sample , platelet adhesion , granula release induction gene expression know involve liver regeneration form experimental study analyze . This study allow investigator verify observation preclinical model evaluate relevance human setting . Furthermore , might enable investigator identify new therapeutic target .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator could previously show platelet derived growth factor like TSP-1 5-HT relevance human liver regeneration . In project investigator aim elucidate platelet specifically release granule . Indeed , dense granule store 5-HT induces proliferation hepatocytes , alpha-granules store TSP-1 reduces proliferative potential . More importantly , various pro-proliferative growth factor VEGF also store alpha-granules . Therefore , systemic reduction platelet count would reduce , pro anti-proliferative factor . A highly regulate granula release postulate allow platelet exert specific function . In 2008 , Italiano et al . present convincing vitro evidence platelet store molecule separate granule , able specifically release upon platelet activation . Furthermore , result group support find . It aim project characterize platelet activation patient liver resection determine specific platelet activation profile correlate clinical outcome . Project plan Included patient : A total 40 patient undergoing hemihepatectomy include . Patients closely monitor perioperatively . Plasma , serum , platelet tissue preparation perform outline . Hypothesis No . 1 : Circulating platelet activation marker increase liver resection . To confirm investigator initial observation specific granula release , platelet activation monitor liver regeneration . In particular , investigator evaluate platelet activation marker perioperative period . In descriptive manner , investigator identify perioperative fluctuation platelet activation reflection physiologic process liver regeneration . This enable investigator elucidate occurrence platelet activation human setting , describe murine model . More importantly , investigator analysis could identify potential treatment target patient insufficient hepatic regeneration . Hypothesis No . 2 : Intra platelet granula content decrease liver resection . Bioactive molecule store platelet alpha granule ( intra platelet - IP ) , evaluate perioperative period . As serum preparation platelet degranulate , IP level granula content calculate subtraction plasma serum growth factor value . Furthermore confirm calculate value , platelet extract generate comparatively analyzed IP growth factor level . The investigator able identify perioperative fluctuation IP growth factor reflection specific intrahepatic release liver regeneration , compare blood sample prior one day liver resection . Hypothesis No . 3 : Platelets locally enrich activated site liver regeneration . During process classical hemihepatectomy , portal vein tumor contain liver lobe initially ligate mobilization dissection liver . The increase portal pressure within remain liver partial hepatectomy believe major inducer liver regeneration . ( 37-40 ) To evaluate platelet play critical role process initiation liver regeneration , tissue specimen collect prior portal vein ligation one hour portal vein ligation ( time initiation liver regeneration ) ( study design illustrate figure 3 ) . Liver specimens comparatively analyzed platelet adhesion protein well mRNA expression . To evaluate relevance platelet tightly regulate process liver regeneration , blood collect 1 hour portal vein ligation . In particular , blood drawn portal vein ( prior liver ) liver vein ( liver ) . From samples platelet isolate degree activation evaluate ( detail see ) . Furthermore , content IP growth factor platelet extract analyze reflect intrahepatic release . Hypothesis No . 4 : Perioperative platelet activation impact postoperative outcome The predictive potential platelet activation marker IP growth factor identify patient poor postoperative clinical outcome analyze . As outcome parameter postoperative LD , morbidity mortality evaluate . These analysis might identify marker select patient undergo hepatectomy good serve alternative treatment . Furthermore , potential treatment target patient insufficient hepatic regeneration could identify .</detailed_description>
