	<brief_summary>Objective : To find much visual improvement possible severe amblyopia use full-time occlusion therapy eye patch see improvement influence patient 's age . Methods : An interventional clinical trial 115 consecutive case unilateral , severe amblyopia conduct tertiary referral center Jan 2010 Oct 2012 . Patients divide three age group : 3-7 year ( n= 38 ) , 8-12 year ( n=41 ) , 13-35 year ( n=36 ) . After complete ophthalmological examination single ophthalmologist , case organic visual loss exclude ; case previous part-time occlusion therapy fail include study . Patients give optimal refractive correction month , follow full-time occlusion therapy along near visual activity 3-4 hours/day . The therapy continue maximum visual recovery achieve ( 6/6 Snellen 's ) . Therapy gradually reduce stopped . Patients followed-up regularly next 18 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Amblyopia , ( 'blunt vision ' Ancient Greek ) , also know lazy eye , visual deficiency eye otherwise physically normal , great would expect structural abnormality eye . There unsubstantiated belief difficult treat amblyopia old age group , child already receive failed amblyopia therapy respond treatment full-time occlusion therapy may result occlusion ( disuse ) amblyopia good eye . The aim study ass whether belief true . Materials method This prospective , interventional clinical trial 115 consecutive case unilateral , severe amblyopia conduct tertiary referral center Lahore , Pakistan , January 2010 October 2012 . Eligibility criterion include age three year , visual acuity amblyopic eye 6/60 Snellen 's even count finger , visual acuity sound eye 6/6 . A complete ophthalmic examination perform one ophthalmologist ( SI ) . This include examine fixation pattern eye , presence absence phoria tropia cover-uncover test , fundus examination color vision use Ishihara color plate . Any case organic cause visual loss exclude study thorough ophthalmological examination . Assessment visual acuity either eye near distance acuity ( Snellen 's ETDRS chart ) refraction Best Corrected Visual Acuity ( BCVA ) perform trained optician mask study patient 's demographic .</detailed_description>
