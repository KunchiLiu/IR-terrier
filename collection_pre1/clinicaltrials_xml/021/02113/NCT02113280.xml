	<brief_summary>Patients wear tear knee ( osteoarthritis ) often refer orthopaedic surgeon follow sudden worsen pain mechanical symptom ( grind , lock , give way ) knee due tear meniscal cartilage . These tear describe degenerative usually cause single injury rather accumulation wear tear . It clear current available evidence best treatment patient . Their underlying arthritis bad enough require joint replacement yet usually manage well minimal problem knee experience meniscal tear . However , symptom likely due arthritis rather tear . Current treatment patient usually form conservative treatment physiotherapy supervise exercise use arthroscopy ( key-hole surgery ) trim damage area meniscus . We know previous research patient improve time extent clear whether great improvement expect follow surgery , whether applies patient problem . Our study intend compare outcome patient proven degenerative meniscal tear image MRI scan , assign arthroscopy follow supervised exercise supervise exercise alone . They randomly assign outcome assess use patient-completed questionnaire ( Knee Outcome Osteoarthritis injury Score [ KOOS ] , SF12 , visual analogue score pain ) whether patient go require surgery period trial . The patient assess baseline , 6 week , 6 month , 12 month 24 month .</brief_summary>
