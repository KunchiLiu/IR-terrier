	<brief_summary>This non-randomized , open-label , multi center study . A cycle therapy 5 consecutive day every 21 day 6 cycle . Stage I consist brief run-in period patient BPDCN ( previously untreated previously treat ) AML ( persistent/recurrent previously untreated ) treat SL-401 3 dose level . During Stage 2 , two cohort BPDCN AML patient treat maximum tolerated dose maximum test dose multiple dose-limiting toxicity observe ( identify Stage 1 ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Stage 1 1 . The patient diagnosis AML BPDCN accord WHO classification ( AML ; exclude acute promyelocytic leukemia [ APL , FAB M3 ] ) confirm hematopathology ( BPDCN ) 2 . The patient must meet one follow ( ) ( b ) ( c ) : 1 . Has evidence persistent recurrent AML peripheral blood and/or bone marrow refractory , relapse , recent prior line treatment . A prior line treatment consider induction regimen involve approve investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy agent , biological agent , and/or hypomethylating agent administer alone combination regimen , intent induce robust cytoreduction ( i.e. , CR ) . The previous induction regimen may SCT intent induce CR . Consolidation and/or maintenance ( include SCT ) may give CR/CRi , count line treatment . Hydroxyurea consider prior line treatment . 2 . Has previously untreated AML consider high risk disease progression and/or unlikely derive transient benefit standard therapy least one following : Treatmentrelated AML , except associate favorable cytogenetics ( e.g. , inversion 16 , ( 16 ; 16 ) , ( 8 ; 21 ) , ( 15 ; 17 ) ) . AML antecedent hematological disease ( e.g. , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , myelofibrosis , polycythemia vera , etc . ) candidate stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) current disease state . 3 . Has histological and/or cytological evidence BPDCN peripheral blood , bone marrow , spleen , lymph node , skin , and/or site either previously untreated persistent/recurrent follow prior treatment BPDCN . 3 . The patient ≥ 18 year old . 4 . The patient ECOG performance score ( PS ) 02 . 5 . The patient adequate baseline organ function , include cardiac , renal , hepatic function : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 40 % measure MUGA scan 2D ECHO within 28 day prior start therapy clinically significant abnormality 12lead ECG Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dl Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl AST ALT ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) 6 . If patient woman child bear potential ( WOCBP ) , negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior treatment . 7 . The patient sign informed consent prior initiation studyspecific procedure treatment . 8 . The patient able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement , include followup survival assessment . 1 .

The patient adequate baseline organ function , include cardiac , renal , hepatic function : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 40 % measure MUGA scan 2D ECHO within 28 day prior start therapy clinically significant abnormality 12lead ECG Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl Serum albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dl Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl AST ALT ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) 6 . If patient woman child bear potential ( WOCBP ) , negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior treatment . 7 . The patient sign informed consent prior initiation studyspecific procedure treatment . 8 . The patient able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement , include followup survival assessment . 9 . The patient ( male female ) agree use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study , continue use acceptable contraceptive method 2 month last infusion SL401 . 1 . The patient diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ; FAB M3 ) . 2 . The patient persistent clinically significant toxicity Grade ≥ 2 previous chemotherapy ( exclude alopecia , nausea , fatigue , liver function test ( mandate inclusion criterion ) ) . 3 . The patient receive treatment chemotherapy , widefield radiation , biologic therapy within 14 day study entry . 4 . The patient receive treatment another investigational agent within 14 day study entry . 5 . The patient previously receive treatment SL401 . 6 . The patient active malignancy and/or cancer history ( exclude AML , BPDCN , antecedent MDS ) may confound assessment study endpoint . Patients past cancer history ( within 2 year entry ) substantial potential recurrence and/or ongoing active malignancy must discuss Sponsor study entry . Patients follow neoplastic diagnosis eligible : nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , organconfined prostate cancer evidence progressive disease . 7 . The patient clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , uncontrolled NYHA Class 3 4 congestive heart failure , uncontrolled angina , history myocardial infarction stroke within 6 month study entry , uncontrolled hypertension clinically significant arrhythmia control medication ) . 8 . The patient uncontrolled , clinically significant pulmonary disease ( e.g. , COPD , pulmonary hypertension ) opinion investigator would put patient significant risk pulmonary complication study . 9 . The patient know active suspect CNS leukemia . If suspect , CNS leukemia rule relevant imaging and/or examination cerebrospinal fluid . 10 . The patient receive immunosuppressive therapy exception lowdose prednisone ( ≤ 10 mg/day ) treatment prophylaxis graftversushost disease ( GVHD ) . If patient immunosuppressive treatment prophylaxis GVHD , treatment ( ) must discontinue least 14 day prior study treatment must evidence Grade ≥ 2 GVHD . 11 . The patient uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , uncontrolled infection , DIC , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 12 . The patient pregnant breast feeding . 13 . The patient know positive status human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active chronic Hepatitis B Hepatitis C. 14 . The patient oxygendependent . 15 . The patient medical condition opinion investigator place patient unacceptably high risk toxicity . Stage 2 BPDCN AML patient group separately .</criteria>
