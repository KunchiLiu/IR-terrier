	<brief_summary>This study multicenter , stratify , randomize , active control , double-blinded , parallel-group comparative study open-label extension period . The study design evaluate efficacy safety FP/ SLM HFA MDI 50/25 microgram ( mcg ) one two inhalation twice daily ( BID ) 8 week comparison FP HFA MDI 50 mcg one two inhalation BID , 6-month 4-year-old Japanese patient bronchial asthma . The study also design evaluate safety long-term treatment FP/ SLM HFA MDI 50/25 mcg one two BID 16 week . The subject meeting eligibility criterion enter run-in period 2 week receive FP 50 mcg 1 2 inhalation bid ( FP 100 200 mcg/day ) , randomization . The subject 2 year age Visit 1 receive 1 inhalation bid run-in period . The subject meet eligibility criterion randomization stratify accord age ( &lt; 2 &gt; =2 year-old ) Visit 1 randomized one two treatment group . The total duration participation study 10 week comparison period completion 27 week completion .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The write informed consent must obtain his/her parent legally acceptable representative . If investigator get oral consent patient , investigator record inform consent sign his/her parent legally acceptable representative . Ethnic origin Japanese Aged &gt; =6 month &lt; =4 year Visit 1 . Male premenarchial female . Premenarchial female define female yet begin menses . Patient : outpatient Diagnosis pediatric asthma make reference JPGL 2012 document help evidence keep source document . As &lt; 2 year old , child go diagnosed accord instruction follow JPGL2012 reference . There 3 episode mark expiratory wheezing , regardless presence respiratory tract infection . It also need confirm asymptomatic period week episode . In addition finding , least one follow finding , helpful diagnose infantile asthma : At least one parent diagnose bronchial asthma physician ( include past history ) ; Specific immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) antibody inhalation antigen detect least one parent ; Diseased child diagnose atopic dermatitis physician ( include past history ) ; Specific IgE antibody inhalation antigen detect diseased child ; High serum IgE level diseased child his/her family ( serum IgE level determine consider age ) ; Eosinophils creola body find sputum ( examine nasal discharge eosinophilia peripheral blood eosinophilia ) ; Expiratory wheeze occurs airway infection ; Expiratory wheezing labor respiration oxygen saturation improve beta2 stimulant inhalation . A patient need treat Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) / Longacting beta 2 agonist ( LABA ) fulfill follow condition : At least one documented exacerbation patient treat systemic glucocorticosteroids , aminophylline dose intravenous ( d.i.v ) continuous isoproterenol inhalation 12 month prior Visit 1 . Or welldocumented regular treatment ICS ( FP 200400 mcg daily equivalent ) continuous use 12 month prior Visit 1 ; The patient receive systemic glucocorticosteroids , aminophylline d.i.v. , ICS ( FP &gt; 200 mcg daily equivalent ) continuous isoproterenol inhalation within 4 week prior Visit 1 . A patient suffer upper low respiratory tract infection receive medication within 2 week prior Visit 1 . A patient diagnose upper low respiratory tract infection Visit 1 . Or patient suspect deepseated mycosis infection effective antibacterial agent available . Or patient suspected respiratory syncytial ( RS ) virus infection identify negative RS virus antigen . A patient respiratory disorder bronchial asthma , investigator judge respiratory disorder affect assessment efficacy study . A patient unstable liver disease chronic stable hepatitis B receiving significant immunosuppressive agent due risk hepatitis B reactivation . A patient malformation/foreign particle lodge airway . Or subject know , preexist , clinically significant gastroesophageal reflux disease , endocrine , autoimmune , metabolic , neurological , renal , gastrointestinal , hepatic , haematological system abnormality uncontrolled standard treatment . A patient suspect hypersensitivity study medication , rescue medication ingredient . A patient treat another investigational product within 1 month prior Visit 1 within five halflives ( thalf ) prior investigational study ( whichever longer two ) . As patient evaluable ECG data Visit 1 , QT interval correct ( Fridericia ) heart rate ( QTc [ F ] ) &gt; =450 millisecond ( msec ) . The QT interval correct heart rate ( QTc ) base average QTc value triplicate electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) obtain brief recording period . As patient n't evaluable ECG data Visit 1 , patient know prolonged QTc &gt; =450 msec ( correction valid ) , patient exclude . A patient child care ( include foster parent system ) , investigator judge inappropriate study . Randomization Inclusion Criterion : A patient asthma symptom score ( total daytime nighttime ) &gt; =6 total &gt; =1 per day &gt; =3 day last 7 consecutive day runin period ( exclude day Visit 2 ) . Completion symptom score ( daytime nighttime ) 5 day last 7 consecutive day runin period require . Randomization Exclusion Criteria : A patient receive systemic steroid runin period . A patient suffer suspected upper low respiratory tract infection may affect assessment efficacy runin period . Or patient suspect deepseated mycosis infection effective antibacterial agent available runin period . Or patient suspect RS virus infection identify negative RS virus antigen runin period . A patient evaluable ECG data runin period . As patient evaluable ECG data runin period , QTc ( F ) &gt; =450 msec . The QTc base average QTc value triplicate electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) obtain brief recording period . A patient able appropriately record patient diary inhale FP appropriately runin period , opinion investigator .</criteria>
