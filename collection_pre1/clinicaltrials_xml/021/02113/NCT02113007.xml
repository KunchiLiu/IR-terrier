	<detailed_description>This Phase II , multi-centered , single-arm study . A brief patient lead-in portion include assess safety feasibility . The first six patient enrol monitored weekly safety two treatment cycle ( 4 week ) adverse event assure unexpected prohibitive toxicity . If safety signal emerge group patient , protocol may discontinue modify .</detailed_description>
