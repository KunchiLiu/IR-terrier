	<brief_summary>The current study randomize controlled clinical trial test feasibility recruiting , randomize , old adult osteoarthritis ( OA ) adhere safely complete Sit ' N ' Fit Chair Yoga program HEP program ( primary objective ) . Secondary objective study determine effect Sit ' N ' Fit Chair Yoga Program reduce level pain ; improve physical function , psychosocial function , life satisfaction adult 65 year age unable participate standing exercise . Participants two site randomly assign either intervention group ( Sit ' N ' Fit Chair Yoga ) attention control group ( Health Education Program ) . Data collector blind group assignment . Data collect prior intervention ( baseline ) , 4 week , 8 week . Follow-up data collect 1 month 3 month completion intervention measure extent effect intervention continue .

	<detailed_description>Consenting Procedure Informed consent obtain participant , follow screening eligibility . Only one consent procedure complete , describe screen study procedure . The Project Directors , PIs , data collector discuss project obtain informed consent . At two study site , participant live independently able sign inform consent . If change study design program make , new consent obtain participant IRB National Center Complementary Integrative Health ( NCCIH ) approval . One copy consent provide participant one copy keep file PIs ' office lock file cabinet . An ID number assign participant place second copy consent form . Randomization : Each participant meet eligibility criterion sign inform consent give ID number list . An overall list participant ID number create Project Director participant enrol . Participants enrol , outside statistician send variable permute block randomization pattern Project Director . The Project Director match randomization pattern list participant determine arm study participant assign . The study statistician , two PIs , two Project Directors responsible data management . Dr. Newman two PIs review data collection form ongoing basis data completeness accuracy , well protocol compliance . They supervise Project Directors site . All research member include PIs , Project Directors , data collector , yoga HEP instructor complete safety training . All complete form , include demographic information , secure locked cabinet primary statistician office FAU . The statistician research assistant enter data independently ( double data entry ) use password-protected access SPSS data entry system data collection period ( baseline , 4 week , 8 week , 1 month 3 month intervention ) . They compare database data entry error check error rate . All data back FAU secure server . The primary statistician clean data , randomly select 10 % case data entry batch check data entry error . An examination statistical model conduct examine normality residual look outlier overly-influential data point . Non-normal residual require modification data analysis technique allow non-normal distribution use . Outliers influential data point examine determine whether reflect error data entry . Errors correct designated miss correctable . Outliers influential data point error note discussed result . The PIs meet primary statistician , Project Directors , RAs regular basis discus progress data entry issue relate data management . SAFETY ASSESSMENTS Study progress safety review quarterly . The study statistician , PIs , Project Directors , Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) review AE rate . Progress report , include participant recruitment , adherence retention/attrition , provide DSMC follow quarterly review . The quarterly report include list summary adverse event ( AE ) , use ID number . The report send DSMC independent monitor forward IRB NCCIH . The IRB review progress study annually . The PIs send copy sign recommendation comment DSMC NCCIH Program Officer quarterly review . An adverse finding attend Chair Yoga session could include increased pain , muscle ache/cramping , fatigue , combination . A serious adverse event ( SAE ) AE result one follow outcomes regardless relationship study intervention : - A life-threatening event - Inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - A persistent significant disability/incapacity - An important medical event , base appropriate medical judgment All write report format require FAU IRB participant , whether change inform consent necessary . SAEs unanticipated , serious , possibly relate study intervention cause discontinuation intervention participant PIs two Project Directors ( one site ) receive note participant 's physician allow participant re-enter intervention . Anticipated unrelated SAEs handle less urgent manner report DSMC , IRB , NCCIH accordance requirement . In annual AE summary , DSMC confirm review SAE report . Sample Size Randomization : The purpose feasibility study compare effect intervention sample study population preparation large clinical trial future research . Determining effect size intervention enable accurate calculation sample size future research study . Although dosage study , may possible , depend adherence , explore effect attendance outcome , could useful future research . Based similar study exercise intervention community-dwelling old adult , estimate sample size 100 would acceptable address primary objective establish accurate effect size Sit ' N ' Fit Yoga intervention . In order oversample 10 % allow participant dropout , 120 participant recruit : 60 participant ( 30 HEP 30 Yoga ) two site . Assignment create three group 10 participant yoga three group 10 participant HEP site . Measurement Tools : Ten measurement tool use determine effect Sit N Fit Chair Yoga program Health Education Program study outcome measure . These tool : Western Ontario McMaster Universities Arthritis Index ( WOMAC ) PROMIS Pain Interference Scale Gait Speed Six-Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) Berg Balance Scale PROMIS Physical Function Short Form PROMIS Fatigue Scale Short Form Life Satisfaction Index Third Age , Short Form ( LSITA-SF ) PROMIS Ability Participate Social Roles Activities Short Form PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression Short Form Data Analyses The primary feasibility outcome assess use mean , frequency , percentage , well contingency table , investigate potential retention adherence difference across group . The exploratory analysis secondary objective conduct two main stage : ( ) preliminary analysis , include descriptive statistic , management miss data , test covariates ; ( b ) hypothesis test . The preliminary analysis use descriptive statistic investigate normality data . Correlations multiple linear regression ( MLR ) use investigate simple multiple relationship group level physical function psychosocial well-being assumption homogeneity variance independence error require sophisticated analytical technique . Both outlier multicollinearity investigate use Cooks Distance , Variable Inflation Factor ( VIF ) , Tolerance . Full restrict regression model use appropriate . Missing Data : With research study potential miss data , especially data collect across multiple time point . This study use Missing Value Analysis ( MVA ) function SPSS ascertain extent , randomness pattern miss data . This program allow one investigate mechanism miss data assign 1 0 vector R variable test whether data miss completely random ( MCAR ) , miss random ( MRM ) , miss random ( MNAR ) . This analysis use Maximum Likelihood Estimated EM algorithm test relationship miss value across variable . Patterns miss data display table figure facilitate description pattern . Based pattern reason miss value , data impute use multiple imputation , widely accept superior single simple imputation , usually empirical Bayesian method stochastic regression imputation . The approach add randomly sample residual term normal ( ) distribution impute value . By default , procedure add bit random error substitution . After imputation , data analyze completers impute data ITT . Next , comparison regression slop complete impute data conduct determine difference . These difference describe primary analysis ITT group use impute data .</detailed_description>

Those require personal assistance ambulate 30 foot ( need hold arm someone walk behind safety ) exclude would able complete 6Minute Walk Gait Speed Test . We provide assistive device train project staff safe use device . During screen potential participant person ask whether able participate stand exercise program regular yoga program . The following question ask people eligible identify two follow : Please check follow feel unable balance , pain , fear fall , fatigue strength Standing 3045 minute Bending toward toe Bending side side Squatting Standing one foot Standing , hold arm outstretched head Twisting body side side</criteria>
