	<brief_title>Effect Cognitive Training Alcohol Use Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study employ randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind design . The intervention group perform repeat cognitive training ( 5 session à 30-40 min / week ) increase difficulty 5 consecutive week use Cogmed® software . The non-intervention group however , perform training task , without increase difficulty . Thus study control non-specific effect regular use computer , adhere train program expectation effect . In order complete study , participant complete minimum 20 training session within maximum time period 6 week . The study conduct Center Dependence Disorders Stockholm , situate within premise Karolinska University Hospital . The Research Subjects : They study include 50 subject diagnosis alcohol use disorder . Research subject recruit public advertisement within Center Dependence Disorders Stockholm . After initial brief telephone screening , potential subject invite clinic Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm screen in-person study participation . The Study intervention : Cogmed® Training Program Cogmed® work memory training computer program administer online . The program consist 7 verbal non-verbal work memory task give immediate performance feedback subject undergoing training . Each training session 90 trial last approximately 30 minute per day , 5 day week total training period 5 week ( i.e . total training time approximately 12,5 hour ) . In order complete study subject must complete 20 - 25 training session within maximum 6 week . The program adjust difficulty different task trial-by-trial , allow subject train level adjust current WM capacity ( see ( Klingberg et al . 2005 ) detail description ) . As control condition , equivalent placebo arm pharmaceutical trial , Cogmed® program consist Standard Training program let user train task without increase difficulty . Thus allow clinical trial software control non-specific effect regular use computer , adhere train program expectation effect . The Study Procedures After inclusion-visit , subject come back clinic weekly follow-up visit span 5 week . The visit schedule ±3 day outline , accommodate schedule subject . Telephone screening : AUDIT questionnaire administer telephone . If subject total score &gt; 16 least 3 point question number 1 ( 3-4 drink per week ) subject call screening visit . Screening Written verbal research subject information study detail study physician . Data collect number item related current alcohol use life time history dependence . In addition scale related physical well trauma also collect . The following procedure inclusion treatment period : Day 1 : Inclusion ( week 0 ) - Urine dip test breathalyzer confirm absence psychoactive substance alcohol - Urine sample analysis U-Ethyglucoronide - Blood sample bio-bank storage ( genetic marker , plasma serum ) - Assessment depressive symptom ( MADRS ) craving ( Short-DAQ ( right ) OCDS ( last 5 day ) ) - Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire - Neuropsychological Testing use CANTAB® + Digit Span Task - Introduction Cogmed® software verbal write training instruction - Administration personal login password Cogmed® software completion first train session Randomization procedure Randomization do accord randomised block design . The total sample size 50 individual . The personal login subject associate either active control train - however neither study coordinator subject know group since evident first day training . Study period : ( Week 1-Week 5 ) Week 1 : Follow-up visit Day 7 - Breathalyser confirm sobriety - TLFB alcohol nicotine since last visit - Urine sample analysis U-Ethyglucoronide - Assessment depressive symptom ( MADRS ) craving ( Short-DAQ ( right ) OCDS ( last 5 day ) Week 2 , 3 4 Follow visit • Same procedure Week 1 Week 5 : Test Day ( Day 35 ) - Urine dip test breathalyser confirm absence psychoactive substance - Urine sample analysis U-Ethyglucoronide - TLFB alcohol nicotine since last visit ; Confirm sobriety day test day - Assessment depressive symptom ( MADRS ) craving ( Short-DAQ ( right ) OCDS ( last 5 day ) ) - Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire - Neuropsychological Testing use CANTAB® + Digit Span Task - Payment complete training session food coupon ( 50 SEK / complete session ) + choice Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire - Voluntarily enrolment treatment program Center Dependency Disorders , Stockholm . Other measure : Urine Analysis : Urine sample take every visit clinic order analyze presence psychoactive substance ( screen , inclusion test day ) analysis U-ethylglucoronide ( inclusion , every week visit test day ) . Breathalyser : At visit clinic , research subject test presence alcohol use alcohol breathalyser ( Lion S-D2 ) . Blood Samples : Each subject leave blood sample bio-bank genetic analysis plasma serum analysis inflammatory marker , neuroendocrine hormone etc analyze completion study . Total blood sample bio-bank 28 ml blood . Physiological Measurements : Heart rate blood pressure measure study nurse , visit clinic . Participant Information Consent : In accordance Declaration Helsinki , potential research subject competent adequately informed investigator every relevant aspect study consent participate . Both oral write information give , address aim , method , source funding , institutional affiliation researcher , benefit potential risk study discomfort may entail . The potential research subject also inform right refuse participate study withdraw consent participate time without reprisal . After ensure potential subject understood information , investigator seek potential subject 's freely-given write informed consent . Ethical Considerations : Risk/Benefit Ratio Study The risk involve study justify anticipate benefit participant . Besides potential benefit intervention , patient establish contact addiction healthcare professional , hopefully encourage enroll treatment program . Thus , many patient AUD never treatment refer treatment study . Furthermore , research subject also compensate 50 SEK / complete training session ( maximum 25 x 50 = 1250 ) additional 100-200 SEK depend choice Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire . Potential risk individual subject discuss : Potential Risks : It anticipate subject enrollment present study cause significant health related risk . However , follow potential risk recognize : 1 . Inconvenience repeat visit possible loss confidentiality ( related clinical information , psychiatric assessment scale , urine screen ) . 2 . Risks associate blood draw include minor pain venipuncture soreness removal needle . 3 . The Monetary Choice Questionnaire involve `` fool '' subject since tell one choice select random - fact decide beforehand different option receive . Procedures Minimizing Potential Risks : 1 . As guard loss confidentiality , information store locked file access member research staff project . No names identify information use publication stem research . 2 . The blood sampling perform experienced research nurse , venipuncture perform maximum one time per visit . 3 . Even though may `` fool '' subject , necessary order make sure one get lot compensation subject . Furthermore , procedure result discomfort individual , small increase compensation study participation . This procedure necessary order get subject answer truthfully option would choose , since offer could potentially real one . Power Estimation : We base power estimation effect size report Klingberg ( 2010 ) review previous study computerize cognitive training . Difference active control group regard pre/post-test performance work memory task around 40 % trained task 15 % untrained task , effect size approximately 1.0 ( Cohens ) . However , effect size improvement cognitive reasoning task weaker ( around 0.4 ) . Given effect size 1.0 , alpha level 0.05 power 0.80 sample size 36 sufficient order detect difference group regard work memory improvement ( calculate use STATA software power program ) . Thus , sample size 50 adequate .</detailed_description>
