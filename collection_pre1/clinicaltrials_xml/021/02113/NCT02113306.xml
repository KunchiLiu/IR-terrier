	<brief_summary>A recent study rat show electrical stimulation vagus nerve ( VNS ) facilitate extinction fear ( Pena , Engineer , &amp; McIntyre , Biological Psychiatry , 2013 ) . The hypothesized mechanism VNS enhance memory consolidation ( increase noradrenergic neurotransmission ) reduce anxiety ( thus : prevent fear response CS may re-consolidate fear memory ) . The effect apparent VNS occur exposure fear condition stimulus ( CS ) , stimulation give immediately follow exposure . These result may implications treatment anxiety disorder human . However , recently , mean investigate effect VNS human fear learn would require invasive implantation vagus nerve stimulators . This fortunately change , non-invasive transcutaneous VNS device approve use E.U . treatment psychological disorder . This study propose use t-VNS investigate effect fear learn extinction ( healthy ) human . Previous research investigated effect human mood memory . The result obtain suggest reduces negative affect enhances memory , finding consistent report rat . It thus reasonable expect t-VNS facilitate extinction fear human . The present study aim answer follow research question : Does t-VNS extinction training : 1. accelerates extinction curve 2. reduces spontaneous recovery previously extinguish fear 3. reduce re-acquisition fear 4. reduce generalization fear stimuli resemble CS+ ? 5. facilitates generalization inhibitory learn stimulus resemble CS- ?</brief_summary>
