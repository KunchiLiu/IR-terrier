	<brief_title>Addition Liraglutide Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Treated With Multiple Daily Insulin Injections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Patients type 2 diabetes generally treat metformin diet first-line therapy ( 1 ) . In Sweden sulphonylureas generally recommend next treatment option due low cost evidence reduce diabetes complication ( 2 ) . The next line therapy include add basal premixed insulin . As final step multiple daily insulin injection basal prandial insulin become standard glycaemic control meet target . Obesity another co-morbid condition population ( 3 ) . The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) publish 1998 , seminal trial demonstrate importance glycaemic control type 2 diabetes , illustrated insulin therapy ( mostly basal insulin alone ) accompany significant weight gain patient type 2 diabetes ( 4 ) . MDI generally result even great weight gain . Today treatment option patient type 2 diabetes MDI poor glycaemic control . In patient basal , intermediate premixed insulin , addition sitagliptin show reduction HbA1c 0.6 percentage unit ( 6 mmol/mol ) change weight ( 5 ) . However , effect patient severe disease , namely require MDI , evaluate . In combination metformin sulphonylurea , add GLP-1-analogue liraglutide , compare add sitagliptin , show great reduction HbA1c significant weight reduction ( 6 ) . In uncontrolled study clinical practice , addition exanatide ( n=22 ) liraglutide ( n=43 ) patient insulin therapy , majority use MDI , associate mean reduction HbA1c 1.0 percentage unit ( 10 mmol/mol ) , reduction weight 7.1 kg , simultaneously , mean reduction insulin dose 37 unit ( 7 ) . At baseline patient generally obese ( mean BMI 36kg/m2 ) , poor glycaemic control , mean HbA1c 8.9 % ( 74 mmol/mol ) insulin dose 92 unit . The number hypoglycaemic event low , treatment satisfaction high patient rat hypoglycaemic episode fewer insulin therapy alone . From result seem may beneficial effect associate liraglutide add type 2 diabetic patient MDI ; however , require confirmation randomise clinical trial . This question particular concern since currently treatment option reduce weight insulin dose simultaneously improve glycaemic control patient group advance disease . Further , many clinician today use therapeutic strategy consist MDI final treatment option , many patient still reach target HbA1c even continue poor glycaemic control ( 7 ) . Therefore , aim study study effect HbA1c add liraglutide MDI overweight obese patient impaired glycaemic control . The propose study randomise double-blind trial 24 week include patient type 2 diabetes poor glycaemic control despite treated MDI least 6 month . The aim study effect HbA1c add liraglutide MDI overweight obese patient impaired glycaemic control . Study drug preparation Novo Nordisk provide study medication treatment code . Apoteket AB , Sweden , handle study treatment logistics . Site monitor Gothia Forum , Gothenburg , Sweden Data management Gothia Forum provide eCRF system use study . Data Management ( include randomisation system ) statistical analysis perform Statistiska Konsultgruppen , Gothenburg , Sweden . Lab continuous glucose monitor All laboratory test measure Research Centre Laboratory Medicine Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden . The DexCom G4 CGM device use 21 day ( 7 day run-in period , 7 day week 12 Â± 7 day 7 day last 2 week trial ) blind monitor glucose value . Risk-benefit assessment Previously publish observation clinical practice ( 7 ) show patient treated multiple daily insulin injection ( MDI ) concomitant addition liraglutide ( off-label ) decrease HbA1c approximately 10 mmol/mo ( 1 percentage unit ) , reduces weight 7 kg decrease insulin dose 37 unit ( 7 ) . These patient prior treatment overweight ( BMI around 36 ) , HbA1c average 74 mmol /mol insulin dose 92 unit . Patients also rat hypoglycaemias few insulin combine liraglutide use alone . In general , patient report improved quality life . There always risk hypoglycaemia insulin therapy irrespective additional glucose-lowering therapy . However , previous finding clinical practice ( 7 ) effect GLP-1 insulin release observe hyperglycaemic condition ( 8 ) indicate liraglutide probably lead major increase risk hypoglycaemias . Since , liraglutide associate reduction body weight previous clinical trial ( 8 ) likely effect exist also individual treat insulin . In summary , risk side effect adverse reaction combination insulin liraglutide probably small relation improve hyperglycaemic control weight reduction may exist add liraglutide type 2 diabetic patient basal prandial insulin . Rational Multiple daily insulin injection ( MDI ) regard advanced treatment regimen patient type 2 diabetes . At study start patient treat MDI least 6 month still suffer poor glycaemic control . The patient include also overweight obese . It therefore importance evaluate whether patient group beneficial effect , glycaemic control weight reduction , add liraglutide , since liraglutide show beneficial effect combination oral glucose lower drug . Moreover , beneficial effect liraglutide observe used off-label combination insulin clinical practice ( 7 ) . Design This double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial parallel-group design . The study involve 120 patient 15 health centre Sweden include 10 visit 26 week . Treatments The study drug liraglutide include 3 different dosage : 0.6 mg , 1.2 mg 1.8 mg. Liraglutide titrate 1.8 mg increase dose every week . Since subject inappropriate glycaemic control ( great equal 7.5 % =58 mmol/mol HbA1c ) general reduction insulin dos make , glucose curve run-in period show clearly low mean glucose level correspond HbA1c 7.5 % =58 mmol/mol well-controlled certain meal , insulin adjustment temporarily consider titration phase liraglutide/placebo . Liraglutide available concentration 6.0 mg/ml supply 3 ml disposable pen-injector . Placebo supply identical disposable pen-injector . Randomization After run-in period maximally 60 day , patient randomise receive either 0.6 mg liraglutide 0.6 mg placebo . Novo Nordisk provide ( cod ) medication pen associate code-list . No study personnel designate data manager responsible setting-up randomisation access complete code-list study blind broken . Apoteket AB/farmaci handle study treatment logistics . Minimisation ( optimal allocation ) use centralise web system ( handle Statistiska Konsultgruppen ) use randomisation . At randomisation subject assign randomisation code ( blindly ) represent treatment ( liraglutide placebo ) patient randomise . The patient also assign unique anonymous Subject ID . Breaking blind The study double-blinded . The randomisation cod break last subject 's last visit study data collect , study database clean declare lock . Apoteket AB/farmaci responsible keep complete randomisation list . The code particular subject may break medical emergency situation . Apoteket/farmaci equip 24 hour emergency telephone service case need break blind individual patient . Telephone number : Weekdays 08.30-16.00 : 040-33 26 74 . Any time : 040-331000 - ask emergency telephone service . The subject withdrawn study case code break include safety population statistical analysis . Duration The expected duration subject participation approximately 32 week ( maximally 60 day run-in , 24 week follow-up randomisation ) . Study population The study include 120 patient 15 centre Sweden . Patients require MDI diabetes drug except metformin recruit include study receive oral write information study give informed consent fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion . The study population identify among diabetic outpatient clinic hospital recruit community-wide basis communication primary care physician . The write information include object purpose study , risk benefit , detailed description event study . The patient opportunity ask additional question first clinic visit The patient randomise 1:1 liraglutide placebo Randomisation code assign strictly sequentially subject eligible randomisation . If subject discontinues participation study , his/her enrolment/subject number reuse . Drop-outs ( expect ~5 % ) replace . Study Stop Criteria The Sponsor/Investigator may decide stop trial part trial time medical reason . Furthermore , manufacturer study drug may revoke product , may lead entire study may interrupt . If trial prematurely terminate suspend , Investigator promptly inform patient ensure appropriate therapy follow-up . Furthermore , Investigator promptly inform Ethics committee provide detail write explanation . The regulatory authority inform accord national regulation . Drop-outs Patients drop-out study receive rescue therapy shall request follow-up additional visit . HbA1c , FPG , C-peptide , pro-insulin , amylase , lipase , liver transaminase , creatinine , calcitonin , fast blood lipid , adiponectin , sensitive CRP , apolipoproteins , weight , blood pressure , insulin dose , waist-hip ratio , abdominal sagittal diameter , concomitant medication treatment satisfaction shall check . Blood sample biobank take . Insulin dose medication record . If drop-out exists reason shall record . Regarding rescue therapy variables shall check possible rescue therapy give . Investigational product treatment subject The trial product dispense subject require accord treatment group . The centralized web randomisation system allocate trial product Dispensing Unit Number ( DUN ) subject randomisation visit . The correct DUN must dispense subject . The Investigator must ensure availability proper storage condition record evaluate temperature ( least every work day ) . Storage facility check frequently . A log document temperature must keep . The study plan 24 week addition run-in period maximally 60 day . Capillary glucose value measure meal 1.5-2 hour meal 2 day 60-day run-in period , 2 day per week first 3 week trial 2 day last 2 week trial . Capillary glucose curve perform run-in period last two week study always measure week CGM disturb interpretation CGM data . The Contour XT SMBG meter ( Bayer ) shall use capillary glucose measurement study . The SMBG meter shall check eash visit initiate CGM , i.e . run-in period , week 12 ( +- 7 day ) week 23-24 . Calibration perform accord manufacturer 's standard . The SMBG meter shall introduce visit 4 . During 7 day run-in period , 7 day week 12 Â± 7 day 7 day 2 last week study , CGM DexCom 4G use . CGM take 7 day , minimum 5 day acceptable . If short period exists , new sensor shall set get data total 7 day ( A total period 5 day acceptable ) . Investigators recommend patient measure 3-4 glucose value per day meal bedtime daily accord clinical guideline potentially adjust insulin dos , diet physical activity . Liraglutide/placebo administer 0.6 mg first week , 1.2 mg second week 1.8 mg third week onward . Dose increase period extend base subject 's tolerance trial product . If subject tolerate 1.8 mg liraglutide/placebo due side effect , dose shall reduce 1.2 mg liraglutide/placebo . Correspondingly , 1.2 mg liraglutide/placebo tolerate 0.6 mg liraglutide/placebo shall use . Since subject inappropriate glycaemic control ( great equal 7.5 % =58 mmol/mol HbA1c ) general reduction insulin dos make . However , glucose profile run-in period shall judge clinician . In follow case clinician consider take follow action liraglutide add : A ) If patient mean glucose level lower 8.5 mmol/l clinician consider reduce total insulin dose 10 % -20 % add liraglutide 0.6 mg B ) If glucose level certain meal well-controlled ( less 7 mmol/l ) clinician consider reduce meal-time insulin dose administer previous meal 10 % -20 % add liraglutide 0.6 mg . If daytime hypoglycaemia occur large 20 % reduction insulin dose previous meal shall consider add liraglutide 0.6 mg. C ) If fast glucose 5.0-7.0 mmol/l basal insulin shall reduce 20 % -30 % add liraglutide 0.6 mg. D ) If fast glucose less 5 mmol/l nocturnal hypoglycaemia occur run-in period basal insulin shall reduce 20 % -40 % . Novel evaluation glucose measurement 4-5 day shall perform confirm FPG great 5 mmol/l new nocturnal hypoglycaemia exist add liraglutide . A novel evaluation accord point A ) -D ) shall perform new glucose value add liraglutide . When increase liraglutide 0.6 mg 1.2 mg well 1.2 mg 1.8 mg correspond action point A-D shall consider base glucose value hypoglycaemias previous week . After titrate liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg patient insulin dos stage reduce , insulin dos increase original dos reach . However , titration stop , i.e. , insulin dos titrate original dos , glucose level stage phase increase dos already target . For example , mean glucose level certain meal le 7 mmol/l add liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg , insulin dose previous meal increase although dose reduce . Correspondingly , mean FPG le 7.0 mmol/l basal insulin dose increase although reduce . The total insulin dose shall titrate high original total insulin dose point study , except rescue therapy require . The diabetes educator physician regular telephone contact patient initial period liraglutide titrate possibly adjust insulin dos . At 6 , 12 18 week follow-up visit contact patient , e.g . telephone contact , insulin dos increase patient low insulin dose original insulin dose randomisation long glucose level target ( less 7.0 mmol/l fast meal ) . However , insulin dos shall increase high original dos , except rescue therapy undertaken In daily activity , patient continue adjust meal-time insulin dose way previously perform clinical practice . Rescue Criteria If fast self-measured plasma glucose ( fast SMPG ) value take three separate day FPG sample analyse central laboratory exceeds limit 15.5 mmol/l baseline week 12 13.5 mmol/l week 12 week 24 , subject call unscheduled visit soon possible . The next scheduled visit await . A confirmatory FPG obtain analysed central laboratory . If FPG exceed describe value , treatable intercurrent cause hyperglycaemia diagnose ( e.g . compliance liraglutide/placebo , miss insulin dose evening , infection ) , subject receive rescue therapy . Rescue therapy define increase total insulin dose original total insulin dose ( i.e . total insulin dose baseline , randomisation ) . It notice rescue therapy NOT give total insulin dose initially reduce trial total insulin dose increase physician due FPG thresholds high total original insulin dose . Rescue therapy exist either patient increase total insulin dose point time total original insulin dose , e.g. , self-adjustments meal-time insulin dos daily activity . Other medication , consider necessary subject 's safety well-being , may give discretion investigator . Medications prescribe study entry preferably remain unchanged study period unless change make safety reason . Procedures Monitoring Subject Compliance Compliance adherence protocol check contact patient . Subject compliance assess DMG monitoring accountability . The unused amount trial product assess dispensed amount , case discrepancy , subject must ask compliance . The individual delegated Investigator must keep track receive , use , partly use unused trial product , possible , empty packaging . This shall properly document . Used , partly use unused trial product empty packaging must store separately non-allocated trial product . Used , partly use unused trial product must store monitor perform drug accountability . Destruction trial product perform accordance local legislation record destruction form . Liraglutide/Placebo Not use : The liraglutide/placebo pen-injector must store refrigerator temperature +2Â°C +8Â°C . Keep away cool element . Do freeze use frozen . In use : After first open liraglutide/placebo pen-injector store one month temperatures +30Â°C refrigerator +2Â°C +8Â°C . The liraglutide/placebo pen-injector must protect source light , pen cap keep pen use . The liraglutide/placebo use appear clear colorless . In case incorrect storage Investigator site staff must contact Novo Nordisk without delay . Trial product ( ) must set on-hold dispensed subject notify Novo Nordisk . The individual delegated Investigator must keep track receive , use , partly use unused trial product , possible , empty packaging , use drug accountability module centralise web system . No trial product dispense person enrolled trial . Returned trial product ( ) ( use , partly use unused possible , empty package material ) must store separately non-allocated trial product ( ) . Destruction trial product do accord local law record destruction form , must sign individual responsible destruction . Standardised procedure administration questionnaires The questionnaire fill study site . The patient allow sit alone reasonable quiet environment answer question . It emphasize patient complete questionnaire prior clinical measurement meet doctor . Questionnaires answer patient alone , however , nurse/assistant inform help patient complete questionnaire necessary , however without influence patient ' response . Ensure patient confidentiality . Study nurse/assistant check questionnaire completeness . The principal investigator assure appropriate training relevant study give Trial Procedures Run-in period The purpose run-in period check glucose value basis possible insulin adjustment perform CGM randomisation . Blinded CGM perform 1 week 60-day run-in period . Capillary glucose value meal 1.5 hour meal measure least 2 day , CGM-period . Treatment satisfaction ( DTSQs ) check , preferentially initiate CGM , since CGM may influence treatment satisfaction . Randomization visit Glucose profile hypoglycaemias run-in period check judge whether insulin reduction shall perform ( See section 8.2 Titration Algorithm ) . At randomisation visit follow variable measure randomisation blood sample send Research Centre Laboratory Medicine Karolinska University Hospital . All blood sample recommend fast facilitate logistics since several test require fasting condition . - Systolic diastolic blood pressure least 5 minute rest sit position appropriate cuff-size - HbA1c fast glucose - Amylase , lipase , creatinine , liver transaminase - Fasting Blood Lipids ( Triglycerides , Total- , HDL- LDL-Cholesterol ) , fast apolipoproteins - Weight - Waist-hip ratio abdominal sagittal diameter - Type insulin dose insulin metformin - AE , SAE hypoglycaemia - Adiponectin , sensitive CRP - GAD-antibodies , calcitonin , amylase , lipase - Fasting C-peptide fast pro-insulin - Biobank sample - Type insulin , dose insulin dos metformin record . - Other type medication record - A morning urin sample Albuminuria/Creatinine ratio measure local laboratory analysis either inclusion/exclusion visit randomisation visit . Web randomisation perform minimisation ( optimal allocation ) liraglutide placebo 1:1 proportion . Telephone contact The diabetes educator physician telephone contact patient follow : - The day start liraglutide/placebo - One 2 day increase liraglutide/placebo 1.2 mg - The day increase 1.2 mg - One two day increase liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg - The day increase liraglutide 1.8 mg - One week increase liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg More frequent telephone contact initial week later study make depend decision diabetic educator physician need individual patient . At telephone contact , insulin adjustment consider accord specify algorithm , i.e . : - hypoglycaemia exist - If glucose value well-controlled titrate liraglutide/placebo In patient insulin dos reduce stage titration liraglutide , regular telephone contact every 3-4 day titrate liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg shall perform . Insulin dose increase original insulin dos reach . The increase insulin dos stop low level earlier original dos reach glucose level already target . Clinical Visits Clinical visit perform week 6 , 12 , 18 24 . Visit Week 6 , 12 18 At 6 week follow-up visit ( Â± 7 day ) , 12 week follow-up visit ( Â± 7 day ) 18 week ( Â± 7 day ) follow-up visit follow variable measure : - Systolic diastolic blood pressure least 5 minute rest sit position appropriate cuff-size - HbA1c , Fasting plasma glucose sent central laboratory - Weight - Type insulin dose insulin dos metformin - AE , SAE hypoglycaemia - Changes concomitant medication - Trial product dispense - At week 12 : blood lipid , lipase , amylase , liver transaminase , creatinine , calcitonin biobank sample send central laboratory .

Hypoglycaemias Hypoglycaemias define accord general guideline American Diabetes Association definition hypoglycaemias study setting ( 9 ) . Hypoglycaemias divide document symptomatic hypoglycaemia , document asymptomatic hypoglycaemia severe hypoglycaemia . Patients counsel typical symptom hypoglycaemia give diabetes diary recording glucose value , sign hypoglycaemias recovery symptom intake carbohydrate . The frequency hypoglycaemia glucose value 3.0 mmol/l 4.0 mmol/l use endpoint . Severe hypoglycaemia also record diabetes diary . If severe hypoglycaemia appear responsible physician patient inform soon possible . The following parameter hypoglycaemia record accordance guideline study design American Diabetes Association : - Number document symptomatic hypoglycaemia ( PG le 4.0 mmol/l ) . - Number document asymptomatic hypoglycaemia ( PG le 4.0 mmol/l ) . - The number symptomatic asymptomatic document hypoglycaemia PG le 3.0 mmol/l also record . - Number glucose value record CGM 3.0 mmol/l 4.0 mmol/l respectively . - Number severe hypoglycaemia . Patients shall inform regard symptom hypoglycaemia request immediately perform finger stick glucose measurement symptom occur may relate hypoglycaemia , avoid delay treat symptom . Full analysis set ( ITT-population ) The full analysis set ( ITT-population ) consist randomised patient receive least one dose study medication least one follow-up measurement . Primary Efficacy Analysis Primary efficacy analysis change HbA1c baseline 24 week follow-up two treatment group use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) HbA1c baseline covariate full analysis set ( ITT-population ) , two-sided test significance level 0.05 . If HbA1c 24 week follow-up miss last observation carry forward ( LOCF ) principle 6 , 12 18 week apply . All measurement obtain rescue therapy exclude efficacy analysis .</detailed_description>
