	<brief_summary>During course tumor growth possibly manipulation surgical procedure , cell rectal tumor may shed peritoneal cavity . Such cell may give rise local recurrence contribute formation metastatic disease , specifically form peritoneal carcinomatosis . Detection cancer cell peritoneal cavity time surgery might therefore value prediction disease recurrence subsequent prognostic implication patient . In study investigator aim determine presence exfoliate tumor cell peritoneal lavage sample patient undergo surgery LARC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer - Exfoliated Peritoneal Tumor Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recently publish study investigate incidence exfoliate cancer cell peritoneal lavage fluid resection locally advanced rectal cancer ( LARC ) . DNA isolate cell obtain peritoneal lavage analyze denature capillary electrophoresis respect mutation hotspots K-RAS gene . This gene mutate 30 % rectal tumor . Exfoliated tumor cell ( assess presence mutate DNA ) find lavage fluid 19/237 patient , presence tumor cell associate poor overall survival . Based encouraging result investigator design comprehensive prospective study , use novel , validate set cancer specific DNA methylation - base biomarkers present vast majority colorectal tumor ( sensitivity 94 % , specificity 98 % ) .Using tumor cell associate biomarkers , investigator aim determine presence exfoliate tumor cell peritoneal lavage sample patient undergo surgery LARC . Lavage perform prior manipulation tumor provide data regard spontaneous iatrogenic tumor cell exfoliation respective contribution patient outcome . If detection exfoliate tumor cell predictive tumor recurrence , would support active approach postoperative chemotherapy , possibly form intraperitoneal chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
