	<brief_summary>The purpose study implement full-scale efficacy trial My Life program . Conducted partnership Oregon DHS Foster Care Program , impact intervention evaluate randomized experimental longitudinal design . Two hundred ten youth , age 16.5-17.5 , enrol 3 wave , randomly assign either comparison group receive typical foster care service treatment group participate key element model , include instruction self-determination skill , support lead coordinate inter-agency transition planning meeting , participation workshop mentor . Outcomes , include youth self-determination , quality life , employment , mental health , educational achievement independent living , assess pre-intervention , conclusion intervention , 12 month post-intervention . The propose study provide important information efficacy model youth exit foster care system , yield unequivocal data whether enhanced self-determination mediates , least partially , various outcome area , include mental health , educational achievement , employment , independent living , quality life ; evaluate effect special education status , gender , race moderate influence impact intervention . Foster care experience , trauma placement instability , consider covariates ; direct effect intervention key foster care experience also explore .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>My Life : Evaluation Self-determination Enhancement Adolescents Foster Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Compared age peer general population , youth transition adult living foster care less likely stable housing , connect care adult , graduate high school , go college , employ ( e.g. , Avery , 2001 ; Pecora et al. , 2003 ; Goerge et al. , 2002 ) . They likely engage risky sexual behavior , become single parent , homeless involve criminal justice system ( e.g. , Courtney et al. , 2006 ; Smithgall , Gladden , Yang &amp; Goerge , 2005 ) . While consensus exist poor outcome youth policy adopt ( e.g. , Foster Care Independence Act ) aim improve transition , evidence-based practice yet validate achieve goal . Skill development focus self-determination enhancement , show associated transition success young people special education , could unrealized potential prepare youth foster care sudden independence experience abruptly age foster care . The overlapping nature risk group ( approximately 40 % youth foster care receive special education service ) suggest skill development self-determination enhancement could cross-cutting benefit . To gather preliminary efficacy feasibility data youth approach transition foster home , pilot study use randomize , 2 group X 3 repeated measure design conduct Oregon ( entitle My Life ) . Sixty youth , age 16.5 17.5 , foster care special education , randomly assign either control group receive community usual service ( CAU ) experimental group receive one-to-one coaching design enhance self-determination ( My Life ) . The My Life intervention group experience statistically significant increase self-determination ( measured ARC ; Wehmeyer &amp; Kelchner , 1995 ) comparison control group . Youth participate intervention also likely exhibit improvement employment outcomes overall well report great involvement transition plan process time compare control group . In addition provide evidence efficacy , My Life pilot provide important feasibility information estimate effect size . Given promising finding randomize control pilot My Life intervention , goal R01 proposal undertake full-scale efficacy trial My Life program . We propose expand work conduct initial investigation include youth prepare exit foster care ( i.e. , youth receive receive special education service ) , specifically assess impact intervention mental health . The propose study , build promise finding initial work , provide important information efficacy model youth exit foster care system , provide data intervention 's direct effect critical outcome , include quality life , mental health , education , employment , employment independent living , whether enhance self-determination mediates , least partially , intervention 's effect critical outcome . Additionally , study investigate whether disability , gender race moderate effect intervention distal outcomes . Trauma symptoms placement instability experience baseline consider covariates ; potential direct effect intervention key foster care experience also explore completion treatment follow along . The propose study four specific aim : 1 ) We recruit 210 foster youth , 16.5 17.5 year age randomly assign either My Life intervention group community usual control group receive typical service ( CAU ) . The intervention design increase youth 's self-determination preparation age care provide follow along assessment outcome challenge high-risk period . To recruit youth , collaborate Oregon DHS target Oregon 's densely populated area : Multnomah County ; 2 ) We use multiple agent , multiple indicator strategy measure key construct assess youth baseline , intervention termination ( 12-month post-baseline ) follow-up ( 12-month post-intervention completion ) . We also collect DHS Foster Care school district archival record three time point . Brief phone interview conduct every 60 day participate youth regard recent service support utilization , global rating key outcome area , stressful event , contact supportive adult . Thus , total 13 60-day phone interview conduct entire 24-month period study enrollment ; 3 ) Using series modeling analysis , test intervention efficacy key element theoretical model . Specifically , test stability versus change self-determination , mental health adjustment , academic achievement , quality life , employment independent living , intervention group assignment ( My Life vs. CAU ) model dummy variable anticipate direct effect outcomes key construct . In second series analysis , test hypothesize mediator effect self-determination mental health adjustment , academic success , quality life , employment independent living , explore whether disability , gender race moderate impact intervention key outcome . The influence trauma placement instability distal outcome examine , intervention 's impact key foster care experience . 4 ) We track fidelity implementation document adherence intervention protocol perform analysis identify intervention component actively associate major outcomes well possible difference intervention component foster youth disability versus without . Oregon DHS strong interest project anticipate work maintain delivery active intervention component .</detailed_description>
