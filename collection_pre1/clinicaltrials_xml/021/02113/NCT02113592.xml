	<detailed_description>Pain common costly public health problem . Common chronic pain condition expensive pervasive , affect least 116 million American adult annual cost $ 560 billion direct medical treatment cost lose productivity , disproportionally affect vulnerable population . Pain primary reason patient seek medical care , first point contact , primary care provider ( PCPs ) deliver majority care .

While pharmacotherapy predominant treatment approach many PCPs , limit patient 's role take medication , become passive recipient care—leading poor outcome , potential overmedication , possible disillusionment medical system . Further , increase opiate prescribe pain treatment—amidst increase awareness adverse outcome , include addiction—and limit efficacy suggest importance broader treatment approach focus patient ' improvement functioning . Although opiate may reduce pain symptom prescribe , patient unlikely experience significant sustain improvement without use nonpharmacologic pain management approach . Medical management patient persistent pain complex problem often fragment , lead patient seek wide variety primary specialty care service effort manage pain related condition . Such fragmented care lead poor outcome significantly increase health care cost patient often receive unneeded diagnostic medical procedure . While research identify evidence-based multidisciplinary behavioral treatment approach effective patient even prevent disability associate persistent pain offer early course care , intervention rarely available everyday practice setting require data pragmatic clinical trial change care paradigm . To address issue , conduct large-scale , mixed-methods , cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial throughout three region Kaiser Permanente - Northwest , Georgia , Hawaii . This trial evaluate integration multidisciplinary service within primary care environment compare usual care setting . This project embed intervention everyday clinical practice flow utilize assessment measure intervention staff directly clinical care system rather utilizing research-developed administered structure . The intervention integrate , interdisciplinary program guide pain-related care intervention patient . This study compare primary care-based intervention usual care use systematic , clinic-based assessment . The trial include 1,200-plus patient 500 primary care provider ( half receive active treatment ) intervention care deliver behavioral specialist , nurse , physical therapist , pharmacist , affiliated staff . Patients include select primary care provider non-malignant chronic pain ( pain persist ≥ 3 month ) long-term opiate therapy treatment condition .
