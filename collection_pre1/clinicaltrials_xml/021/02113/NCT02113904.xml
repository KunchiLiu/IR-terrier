	<brief_summary>The main objective study therapeutic : determine effect Adalimumab ( HumiraR ) clinical inflammatory manifestation patient Netherton syndrome 3 month treatment , post treatment period follow-up 3 month . Second objective To evaluate safety Adalimumab context NS To evaluate improvement quality life 3 month To evaluate improvement pruritus pain patient To study marker inflammatory allergy NS prior treatment Benefit study An improvement least 20 % cutaneous sign patient suffer genetic incurable , chronic , painful afflict disease would great help patient . NS major source social exclusion . Risks They inherent risk biotherapies , especially anti-TNF therapy , comprise risk infection . Cutaneous infection occur mainly infancy , therefore chosen treat patient 4 year age study . A close clinical surveillance set ( initially every week first month treatment , every month ) . This represent large number visit provide high level security . Benefits/risks ratio In absence curative treatment patient severe genetic skin disease , benefits/risks ration clearly appear favour expect benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Using Humira Netherton Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Netherton syndrome ( NS ) rare ( incidence estimate 1 100 000 ) severe genetic skin disease characterize scaly erythroderma birth , abnormal hair severe psoriasiform /atopic dermatitis-like lesion high IgE level allergic manifestation . It considerable impact quality life patient , result inflammatory painful flare , chronicity lesion , severe growth retardation definitive short stature . NS cause loss function SPINK5 mutation lead unregulated epidermal protease activity : kallikrein 5 , kallikrein 7 elastase protease find overactive following loss inhibition . Secondly , KLK5 activate PAR-2 receptor keratinocyte surface lead activation NF-KB pathway release different pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha . There specific treatment NS . The different therapeutic attempt Soriatane ( acitretin ) worsen skin inflammation dryness . The use topical calcineurin inhibitor ( Tacrolimus ) sometimes improve skin inflammation important systemic diffusion . The use immune suppressive drug severe patient NS follow labelized Centre ( Cyclosporine , methotrexate , mycophenolate mofetil ) bring significant durable improvement . So NS distress genodermatosis . For clinical biological consideration , benefit anti TNF treatment could expect evaluation treatment justify NS . The clinical case adult patient severe NS , improve anti-Tnf treatment recently publish literature</detailed_description>
