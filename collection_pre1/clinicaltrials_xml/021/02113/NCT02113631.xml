	<brief_summary>1 . The primary objective study comparative effectiveness tolerability boceprevir vs. telaprevir HCV treatment , within VA population . 2 . The secondary objective : - Resource use : recording difference resource use , direct cost ( e.g. , drug acquisition cost ) indirect cost ( e.g. , staff utilization etc . ) study derive data compare two drug also study effect different treatment length .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Tolerability Boceprevir v Telaprevir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness safety boceprevir telaprevir . Recruitment current eligible subject occur regular appointment Hepatitis C clinic . Eligible patient already clear Hepatitis C treatment screen period include blood work , liver biopsy , urine collection/analysis , pregnancy screen behavioral/mental health screening . On one standard visit Hepatitis C clinic , health care provider ( also research staff ) research staff provide consent form patient may take home read study . On day enrollment , also first day treatment , health care provider within Hepatitis C clinic describe study patient refer one research completion task . The consent form explain detail meeting , patient opportunity ask question make comment study . Study subject initially stratified 6 group ( 1a . treatment naif without cirrhosis b. compensate cirrhosis ; 2a . prior treatment experience non-responders without cirrhosis b. cirrhosis ; 3a . prior treatment experience relapsers without cirrhosis b. cirrhosis ) . Patients group randomize use random number table allocation concealment achieve use serially number , opaque , seal envelope one two study group . The first group receive boceprevir Peg-IFN ribavirin indicate package insert , second group receive telaprevir Peg-IFN ribavirin indicate package insert . All stratify group receive protease inhibitor therapy indicate FDA product labeling . Safety effectiveness assessment conduct study entry , PI therapy week 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 42 48 , applicable . Those SOC visit treatment period include blood test , complete review system , physical exam . Patients group assess sustained viral response ( SVR ) 12 24 week last dose medication administer . Identical SOC , safety effectiveness assessment determine health care provider adjudication committee , latter unaware treatment arm patient . Members adjudication committee independent treat clinician , responsible adjudicate follow outcome : - Viral response - Adverse effect - Decision regard treatment discontinuation , base adverse effect virological failure</detailed_description>
