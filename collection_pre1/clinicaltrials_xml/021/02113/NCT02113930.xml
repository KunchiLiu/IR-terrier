	<brief_summary>Definition : Idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia ( ICL ) immune deficiency first described 1992 characterize US Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count &lt; 300/mm3 &lt; 20 % total T cell one cell count ; evidence infection HIV-1/2 human T-cell lymphotropic 1/2 ( HTLV-1/2 ) ; lack define immune-deficiency disease therapy lymphocytopenia . Epidemiologic , clinical immunological characteristic syndrome described 1993 ICL consider heterogeneous syndrome cause infectious agent . Patients ICL may show opportunistic infection disseminate Cryptococcus neoformans infection , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia John Cunningham ( JC ) virus infection result profound cell-mediated immune-response deficiency . Few study focus pathophysiology ICL . CD4+ T-lymphocyte phenotyping reveal increase CD95 expression could responsible excess apoptosis lead lymphocytopenia . Moreover , membrane expression C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ( CXCR4 ) find impaired T lymphocytes ICL , CXCR4 traffic improve interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) treatment patient . Recently , mutation nunc119 , MAGT1 Rag find associate CD4+ T lymphocytopenia . In prospective study 39 patient , CD8+ T lymphocytopenia ( &lt; 180/mm3 ) degree CD4+ T-cell activation measure human leukocyte antigen DR ( HLA-DR ) expression find associate poor prognosis . ICL heterogeneous disorder often associate deficiency CD8+ , CD19+ , and/or NK cell . Long-term prognosis may relate initial CD4+ NK cell deficiency . Larger study need well identify patient might benefit IL-2 therapy . This investigator conduct Lympho-4 study , investigator plan include 200 patient suspected/proven diagnosis ICL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Definition . Idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia ( ICL ) immune deficiency first described 1992 characterize US Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count &lt; 300/mm3 &lt; 20 % total T cell one cell count ; evidence infection HIV-1/2 human T-cell lymphotropic 1/2 ( HTLV-1/2 ) ; lack define immune-deficiency disease therapy lymphocytopenia . ICL heterogeneous disorder often associate deficiency CD8+ , CD19+ , and/or NK cell . Thus , ICL correspond unique disease probably number different condition distinct underlie mechanism . This investigator decide launch Lympho-4 study , investigator plan include 200 patient suspected/proven diagnosis ICL . The aim study 1. identify patient diagnosis ICL confirm use algorithm develop group multidisciplinary expert . 2. describe compare clinical , immunological follow characteristic patient diagnosis ICL confirm vs patient diagnosis ICL confirm . The investigator also investigate : Lymphocyte subpopulation include analysis differentiation activation T B lymphocytes , immortalisation cell lineages virus Epstein Barr virus , high rate genome wide genetic screening , investigation mutation associate identified primary immune deficiency ( adenosine deaminase et class II MHC ) , constitution biobank frozen plasma serum sample ; investigation thymic volume perform CT scan . Depending clinical presentation base previous data obtain group , investigator investigate immune response Human papilloma virus ( HPV ) , Cryptococcus neoformans , implication chemokines involve lymphocyte migration ( CXCR4 CCR7 receptor ) signalisation response cytokine control LT CD4+ homeostasis ( IL-7 et IL-2 ) .</detailed_description>
