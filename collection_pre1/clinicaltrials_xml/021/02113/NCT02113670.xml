	<brief_summary>More 11 million woman United States suffer stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) , involuntary leakage urine everyday activity put temporary stress abdomen bladder , laugh , cough , walk . For woman SUI , pressure often cause urine leak involuntarily . SUI affect woman age include young mother , pre-menopausal woman , senior , result significant emotional distress . Current solution SUI include disposable pad , behavioral treatment ( pelvic floor physical therapy ) surgical intervention . Patients SUI fail conservative treatment wish treat surgery may require work-up urodynamic study abdominal leak point pressure ( ALPP ) define reflect severity SUI . There continuous need develop less invasive treatment SUI could minimize use pad , could alternative painful , costly surgical procedure . The Trendlines Group lab solution non-surgical alternative treatment SUI . The concept future treatment solution base simple physic : inject small amount air urinary bladder , eliminate greatly reduces involuntary urinary leakage . The air bubble act `` shock absorber '' reduce temporary pressure increase bladder cause urinary leakage . The concept new treatment test lab environment use lab jig test pig urinary system ( bladder urethra ) . The lab test show significant improvement bladder pressure treatment implement suspend stress pressure level cause urine leakage .</brief_summary>
