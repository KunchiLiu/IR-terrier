	<brief_summary>The study design open-label , prospective , single arm , multicenter study everolimus histologically confirm , neuroendocrine carcinoma G3 /neuroendocrine tumor G3 failure first-line platin-based chemotherapy ( open-label pilot study ) . The aim study provide second line therapy patient type platinum base first line chemotherapy , gather data disease control rate progression free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Everolimus Second-line Treatment Poorly Differentiated Neuroendocrine Carcinoma / Neuroendocrine Carcinoma G3 ( WHO 2010 ) Neuroendocrine Tumor G3 - Investigator Initiated Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As efficient drug urgently need treatment neuroendocrine tumor investigator evaluate phosphorylated Mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) effector series NEC G3 Charité Center . Everolimus show antiproliferative effect bronchial NET . In second approach data study basis generate another study explore everolimus maintenance therapy NEC G3/ NET G3 .</detailed_description>
