	<brief_title>Recurrent Wheezing Infants : Risk Factors Prevention With Probiotics .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES GENERAL - Assess whether probiotic supplementation reduces frequency recurrent wheeze infant . SPECIFIC - Identifying presence environmental genetic factor recurrent wheeze infant , may serve major confounders effect probiotic sample study risk factor . - Check effect probiotic recurrence wheeze infant . - Evaluate effect probiotic immune response infant wheezing , measurement IL - 10 , IL - 12 Interferon-gama intervention use probiotic . DESIGN RESEARCH Study Design - Inferential , type longitudinal , randomize trial , double-blind , parallel , placebo-controlled study . Intervention hold : - Patients attend Infant Hospital Federal University Pernambuco undergo clinical investigation completion baseline examination eligible participate study inform consent parent guardian . Infants recurrent wheezing , six month two year age , divide two group - one receive formula probiotic ( treatment group ) formula similar organoleptic characteristic , placebo ( control group ) . Flowchart randomization - Patients assessed eligibility verification randomize follow CONSORT flowchart second Guide - 2011 . IMPLEMENTATION OF RESEARCH Local survey period - Hospital da Clinicals , Federal University Pernambuco - UFPE , Brazil . Period April 2014 Abril 2015 . Population Research - Method Selection Sample - Sample selection recur wheeze infant attend Infant Hospital das Clinicas UFPE , consider eligible admission study meet criterion inclusion exclusion . The wheeze infant select eligible study remain wheeze even use inhaled corticosteroid . Type Randomization Allocation Mechanism - A simple randomization patient draw number 1 - 60 . Randomization perform third person use randomization program computer . The sequence random number , recruitment allocation patient intervention principal investigator study conduct . Sample Size - The sample size calculation base two study probiotic asthma , whereas level less 5 % , power study 80 % acceptable error 20 % , 60 patient significance sufficient analyze number desire effect evaluation wheeze infant reject accept null hypothesis . Operationalization Steps - The infant consider eligible study , free inform consent participate study sign parent guardian . These patient initially attend , shall undergo medical examination protocol question answer QE - EISL ( technical interview parent guardian ) achievement immediate skin test sensitivity major aeroallergens food allergen ( mite , cat dog epithelium , mold , feather , cockroach , egg yolk , egg white cow 's milk protein ) skin prick test chest radiography . Patients start probiotic placebo , dosage cytokine IL-10 , IL-12 INF-gamma , IgE eosinophils . The wheezing infant use inhaled corticosteroid beclomethasone 50mcg - 02 jet per day ( 100mcg - dia ) , find medication free , brand name specification : Clenil HFA 50mcg spray 200 dos initial fundamental treatment wheeze age group , dose consider minimal . The formula probiotic contain 10 CFU ( Colony Forming Unit ) /g consortium probiotic strain lactobacilli , lactococcus , streptococcus , yeast acetobacter type appropriate concentration per gram . It supply lyophilized form , sachet contain 1 g probiotic , used addition milk , juice yoghurt first morning meal daily . The placebo supply way organoleptic characteristic formula probiotic . During period , infant wheeze present crisis , parent guardian note day wheeze attack treatment use standardized form open answer , provide , contact telephone , researcher . Parents guardian receive daily record control , assess occurrence wheeze attack . After eight week use probiotic , infant undergo new measurement cytokine IL - 10 , IL - 12 Interferon - gama , objective evaluate immune response probiotic group . Before end period , patient undergo physical examination parent guardians interview , assess occurrence wheeze attack . These data analyze ass whether supplementation probiotic reduce frequency wheeze infant . Masking Allocation Mechanism A third member study assign number probiotic placebo recipient accordance number randomization , without knowledge investigator patient . Containers equal contain substance organoleptic characteristic . The container provide numerical order , service previous randomization . Instruments Measurement Assessments QE- EISL : write questionnaire ( International Study Wheezing Infants ) - see Appendix 01 , instrument consist 45 question demographic characteristic , wheeze potential risk factor . Originally developed Spanish , translate Portuguese ( Brazilian ) validate . This protocol use closed question answer , use technical interview , conduct researcher , parent guardian . Statement Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) - see apêncice 02 - approval thereof child participate study . Control plug - clinical - see Appendix 03 : use parent guardian describe date , `` wheeze `` perceive treatment need , use probiotic placebo ( 08 week ) 08 week . Prick Test : standardize extract dihiclorada histamine ( 10mg/ml ) 0.9 % saline ( FDA - Immunotech , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil ) use . The extract drip volar surface forearm perform one puncture sterile lancet . As positive control histamine negative saline control . The diameter reaction evaluate 15 minute result express positive wheal ≥ 3mm negative control . Eosinophil count total serum IgE Dosage : hold peripheral blood collection vessel qualify professional lab , amount 7.0 ml . The reference value appropriate age standardization laboratory . Chest radiography : hold radiology department Hospital da Clinicals - UFPE . Dose IL - 10 , IL - 12 Interferon-gama : hold peripheral blood collection vessel qualify professional lab amount 5.0 ml . This blood take Laboratory Ageu Magalhães , submit centrifugation perform supernatant peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , count cytokine serum . Then cultivation cell 48 hour subsequent count cytokine IL - 10 , IL - 12 Interferon - gama perform . The peripheral blood mononuclear cell concentration 1 x 106 cells/mL collect patient treatment group placebo group incubate phytohemaglutinin ( PHA ; 10μg/ml ) 48 hour . Production IL - 10 , IL - 12 Interferon - gama culture supernatant analyze use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) kit . The detection limit cytokine 5ρg/ml . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Statistical Methods Data Analysis - For statistical analysis Initially , probability distribution ( percent analysis ) perform . Subsequently , techniques normal distribution homogeneity variance mean ShapiroWillks bartlett , respectively , test apply characterize use parametric Student 's test Manny Whitney independent sample . For categorical variable chi- square test association Yates correction use . Data express mean standard deviation ( parametric test ) median standard error ( nonparametric test ) significance level p &lt; 0.05 . 21 Windows 2011 - generate analyzes , statistical package SPSS use .</detailed_description>
