	<brief_title>Phase Ib Study BKM120 With Cisplatin XRT High Risk Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This phase Ib study combine standard chemoradiotherapy weekly cisplatin BKM120 ass tolerability combination high risk patient locally advance Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck ( SCCHN ) . The investigator also obtain preliminary information efficacy treatment . - The participant receive study drug buparlisib daily , mouth , 45 day . The participant give study drug-dosing diary cycle . It include special instruction take study drug home . - The investigator look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose give depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . - All participant receive weekly cisplatin injection . Cisplatin give intra-venously ( IV ) day : ( 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 43 ) DFCI . - All participant receive daily radiotherapy intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 7 week , deliver DFCI . IMRT type 3-dimensional radiation therapy use computer-generated image show size shape tumor . Thin beams radiation different intensity aim tumor many angle . This type radiation therapy reduce damage healthy tissue near tumor . - The investigator would like keep track participant 's medical condition . Follow-up continue every 4 12 week end treatment first year investigator 's discretion thereafter .</detailed_description>
