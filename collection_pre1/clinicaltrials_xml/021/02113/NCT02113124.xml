	<brief_summary>Years suffer brain injury , individual remain physically cognitively impaired state . The investigator believe concentration amino acid blood chronically alter yield negative effect individual health . Preliminary data show significantly low concentration amino acid serum sample TBI population , diminish level amino acid may due change microbiome . Understanding change help guide rehabilitative service population . Individuals chronic brain injury donate sample blood , oral tissue , fecal matter compare non-injured individual . Genetic information host strip discard ; participant 's genetic information retain . To good understand change microbiome , history antibiotic probiotic assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Amino Acid Prevalence Chronic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate level Amino Acids adult individual chronic ( &gt; 2 year ) traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) compare non-brain injured cohort population . Preliminary data assay amino acid individual chronic TBI compare assay individual without TBI reveal significantly low concentration amino acid within TBI group . The composition structure oral fecal microbiome determine 16S rDNA sequencing . Taxonomic community structure profile treat outcome variable model together participant 's plasma amino acid concentration , year post-injury , age , sex variable determine correlation . These correlation may improve understand diminish amino acid metabolism within chronic TBI population . The endpoint identify microbiome structure composition 16S rRNA gene sequence within TBI healthy participant assess participant 's amino acid concentration participant demographic phenotypic characteristic ( year post-injury , age , sex ) . This comparison may improve understand diminish amino acid metabolism within chronic TBI population .</detailed_description>
