	<brief_summary>Advances renal transplantation increase life-expectancy patient end-stage kidney disease . Conventional immunosuppressive drug prevent efficiently early allograft loss due T-cell mediate rejection . However , emerge data suggest majority late kidney failure may attributable antibody-mediated rejection ( AMR ) , poorly respond currently available therapeutic . Complement-fixing donor-specific anti-HLA antibody associate bad outcome keep well-established role complement AMR pathogenesis . Eculizumab , first licence complement blocker , find efficient reduce occurrence AMR lesion highly sensitized patient . A report also suggest complement blockade may great value salvage therapy graft-threatening severe AMR . However , information available literature interest complement blockade curb progression subclinical acute AMR chronic AMR . The purpose study determine whether complement blockade eculizumab effective safe treatment subclinical AMR sensitize kidney transplant recipient . Despite appropriate therapy , 75 % patient receive renal transplant preform donor-specific antibody display subclinical AMR 3-month protocol biopsy . Subclinical AMR define histological lesion AMR concomitant stable graft function . Moreover , extent lesion 3 month post-transplant correlate occurrence irreversible scar chonic antibody-mediated rejection 12-month biopsy . This study aim explore efficacy safety eculizumab patient exhibit subclinical AMR 3 month-post-transplant biopsy , reduce even normalize microcirculation inflammation , prevent chronic rejection ( transplant glomerulopathy ) 12 month-screening biopsy . Eculizumab-treated patient compare historical control , match lesion 3 month biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advance renal transplantation treatment patient end-stage kidney failure lead significant improvement patient survival . T-cell direct immunotherapeutic agent capable prevent early allograft loss represent cornerstone current maintenance immunosuppressive regimen . However , recent study point majority ( 63 % ) late kidney failure could attributable antibody-mediated rejection . Microcirculation inflammation ( poly mononuclear cell within glomerular peritubular capillary ) correlate best alloantibody-induced endothelial damage complement-fixing anti-HLA antibody , predicts evolution toward chronic antibody mediate rejection ( transplant glomerulopathy ) , associate poor outcome . Microcirculation inflammation , hallmark lesion AMR , frequently observe ( 75 % ) screening biopsy perform sensitized patient receive renal transplant across positive crossmatch due preform DSA , despite intensive prophylactic therapy ( include polyclonal immunoglobulin , plasma exchange rituximab ) . Altogether finding underscore need innovative treatment well control humoral arm chronic rejection patient donor-specific anti-HLA antibody . Short-term eculizumab treatment might promise avenue . Complement blockade eculizumab find efficient reduce occurrence AMR lesion highly sensitized patient . A report also suggest complement blockade may great value salvage therapy graft-threatening severe AMR . However , information available literature efficacy complement blockade curb progression subclinical AMR chronic AMR . The primary objective study : â€¢ To determine effectiveness eculizumab reduce durably alloantibody-induced microcirculation inflammation prevent chronic microcirculation damage 12-month screen biopsy . The secondary objective study : - To assess effect eculizumab serum creatinine level , amount proteinuria , measure estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( mGFR ) 3 12 month post-transplant . - To determine effectiveness eculizumab hamper appearance interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy ( IF/TA ) , dampen alloantibody-induced accelerated arteriosclerosis 1-year-post-transplant biopsy . - Incidence biopsy-proven antibody-mediated acute rejection ( rise creatinine value high 20 % baseline value ) . - To monitor DSA level 3 , 6 12 month post-transplant solid-phase assay ( Luminex ) . - To assess vital sign ( systolic , diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , weight , temperature ) laboratory parameter every eculizumab administration . - To collect safety data infection , cardiovascular event , malignancy - To monitor endothelial , platelet leukocyte microparticles well endothelial cell progenitor - To quantify number endothelial NK express gene correlate AMR This open-label exploratory study evaluate eculizumab administration sensitize patient subclinical antibody-mediated rejection 3 month-post-transplant . Ten patient fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study compare 20 historical control match sensitization histological lesion 3 month . The patient enrol study give eculizumab 3 12 month post-transplant , accord standard protocol adult heavier 40 kg ( 900 mg weekly 4 week , 1200 mg fifth infusion 1200 mg every week thereafter ) . Clinical laboratory evaluation include vital sign safety laboratory value monitor predetermined time point .</detailed_description>
