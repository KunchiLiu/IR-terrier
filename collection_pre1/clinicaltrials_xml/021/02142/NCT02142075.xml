	<brief_summary>Treatment infection critically ill patient remain significant challenge intensivists world-wide persist high mortality morbidity . Compelling evidence suggest source control pathogen appropriate antibiotic therapy remain important intervention improve patient ' outcome , latter include administration suitable molecule optimize dosage regimen . Daptomycin first representative new family antibiotic , cyclic lipopeptides . Its bactericidal effect Gram-positive bacteria , include meticillin-resistant strain , low renal toxicity , make useful antibiotic critically ill patient infection due resistant Gram positive strain . Unfortunately , PK study perform infect critically ill patient without renal replacement therapy . A vast array pathophysiological change occur infect critically ill patient , leading change volume distribution clearance antibiotic patient , may affect antibiotic concentration target site . It therefore important good characterize daptomycin PK infect patient various degree renal failure order define optimal dosing regimen . This project aim identify optimal daptomycin administration schemes critical care patient various degree renal impairment</brief_summary>
