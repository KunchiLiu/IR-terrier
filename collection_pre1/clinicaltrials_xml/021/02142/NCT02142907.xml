	<brief_summary>In general radiation oncology practice , breast cancer typically comprise approximately 25 % total patient caseload.1 Surgery primary modality treatment . Radical mastectomy remain mainstay surgical therapy 1970s . Breast-conserving surgery follow radiation therapy intact breast establish standard care majority woman early stage invasive breast cancer . Recommended technique breast-conservation treatment local excision primary tumor , preferably clear margin , axillary lymph node dissection , breast irradiation ( 45 50 Gy ) , usually boost ( 10 20 Gy , depend tumor size status surgical margin ) . The aim study compare two boost regimen 10Gy/5 # /1 week 16Gy/8 # /1.5 week post lumpectomy patient early stage breast cancer , follow whole breast irradiation ( WBI ) . The study include 50 patient , ( 25 arm ) early stage post lumpectomy breast cancer patient . Each patient treat WBI follow tumor bed boost either electron beam therapy 3D CRT . The primary end point study assessment acute late radiation toxicity , cosmetic score analysis local control two schedule . Secondary end point recurrence-free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Two Boost Radiation Schedules Post Lumpectomy Early Stage Carcinoma Breast</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients include study pre-operatively stag accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) 7th edition , International Union cancer ( use TNM stag ) stage I , stage II breast carcinoma . Fifty patient histologically prove post lumpectomy case carcinoma breast suitable whole breast radiotherapy enrol study . Patients would evaluate Department Radiotherapy PGIMER , Chandigarh thorough clinical examination follow routine investigation include hemogram , liver function test , kidney function test , chest X-ray . Patients treated standard rectangular tangential field radiotherapy whole breast . CT base plan do photon boost electron beam therapy . Inclusion criteria 1 . Unicentric primary breast cancer invasive ductal histology . 2 . Stage T1 , T2 , N0 , N1 , M0 Exclusion criteria 1 . Tumor histology invasive situ lobular carcinoma pure ductal carcinoma situ . 2 . Skin involvement . 3 . History prior primary malignancy . 4 . History prior irradiation chest 5 . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Procedure Fifty patient ( 25 arm ) schedule whole breast radiotherapy lumpectomy include study . An informed write consent prescribe proforma patient take perform plan CT scan . Prior radiotherapy planning , breast conserving surgery form lumpectomy carry department surgery general anaesthesia . Patients recruit 2-3 week lumpectomy . A planning CT scan make patient . The patient position breast board sternum parallel table , ipsilateral arm abduct head . Before CT scan skin mark would place enable patient reposition treatment . Radioopaque marker place locate whole breast lumpectomy cavity CT image . Patients scan level larynx level upper abdomen , include lung scan thickness index 5mm . The CT scan include complete leave right lung , breast heart . Then CT image transfer treatment planning system . The gross tumor volume ( GTV ) define lumpectomy cavity contour CT slice . The clinical target volume ( CTV ) consist GTV uniformly expand three dimension 1cm ; however volume constrain lie 5mm within external contour pectoralis major muscle . The planning target volume ( PTV ) calculate CTV use uniform three dimensional expansion 0.5 cm . The ipsilateral whole breast define lie within radioopaque marker deep anterior chest wall muscle . The cranial extent heart include infundibulum right ventricle , right atrium right auricle exclude pulmonary trunk , ascend aorta superior vena cava . The low external contour heart caudal border mediastinum . The pericardium exclude heart volume . Both lung contour . The contralateral breast contour breast parenchyma visible CT image . After contour target volume organ risk ( OAR ) , standard whole breast rectangular field plan , 3D-CRT boost electron boost plan generate . Dose prescribed would 40 Gy/16 # /3 week whole breast rectangular plan boost 10 Gy/5 # /1week arm A 16Gy/8 # /1.5weeks Arm B . Plans evaluate quantitatively ( analyze dose volume histogram ) qualitatively ( visually inspect isodose curve ) . Plans inspected conformity dos deliver target organ risk . First follow 1 month treatment , subsequently every 2 month till 6 month , 3 monthly till 1 year 4 monthly till 3 year . Patient examine clinically acute effect , cosmetic outcome LRR . Required investigation do indicate . Assessment toxicity do per RTOG score AND LENT SOMA scale SKIN Grade0 Grade1 Grade2 Grade3 Grade4 Toxicity No change baseline Follicular , faint dull erythema/ epilation/dry desquamation/ decrease sweat Tender bright erythema , patchy moist desquamation/ moderate edema Confluent , moist desquamation skin fold , pit edema Ulceration , hemorrhage , necrosis Subcutaneous &amp; cutaneous tissue Grade 0 Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Toxicity None Slight induration ( fibrosis ) loss subcutaneous fat Moderate fibrosis asymptomatic Slight field contracture &lt; 10 % linear reduction Severe induration loss subcutaneous tissue Field contracture &gt; 10 % linear measurement Necrosis Pigmentary change : 0 = None 1 . = Transitory , slight 2 . = Permanent , mark Breast edema : 0 = None 1 = Asymptomatic 2 = Symptomatic 3 = Secondary dysfunction Cosmetic assessment do use Harvard/NSABP/RTOG Breast Cosmesis Grading Scale Statistical analysis The principle end point study analysis acute late radiation toxicity , cosmetic score analysis local control two boost arm . Skin , subcutaneous toxicity cosmetic assessment do treatment regular follow study . Chi-square test use compare radiation toxicity parameter . Descriptive statistic include mean standard deviation obtain variable . A student t-test use compare dosimetric parameter . p value &lt; 0.05 take significant . All test would perform use SPSS ( Statistical Package Social Sciences ) v.12.0 .</detailed_description>
