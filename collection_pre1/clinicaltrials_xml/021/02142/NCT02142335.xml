	<criteria>Patients must inoperable stage III IV melanoma . Patients include trial base follow criterion : Patients previously treat 1 nonabraxane contain chemotherapy regimen patient BRaf mutation , receive vemurafenib combination Dabrafinib trametinib ( similar compound clinical trial ) progress , document surgically inoperable stage III IV metastatic melanoma pathologic examination tissue . Previous treatment immunotherapy allow . Patients treat either immunotherapy chemotherapy must either 4 week last treatment fully recover previous treatment . Measurable evaluable nonCNS disease require define : Unidimensionally measurable lesion determine physical exam , Xray , CT scan , MRI , radiographic procedure .
