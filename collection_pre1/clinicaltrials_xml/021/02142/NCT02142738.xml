	<brief_summary>This efficacy safety study assess pembrolizumab ( MK-3475/SCH 900475 ) compare standard care ( SOC ) platinum-based chemotherapy treatment participant previously untreated stage IV , program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) strong express Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . The primary hypothesis study participant PD-L1 strong NSCLC long Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) , assess Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors version 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) treat pembrolizumab treat SOC platinum-based chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) Compared Platinum-Based Chemotherapies Participants With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( MK-3475-024/KEYNOTE-024 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment Phase : Participants randomize pembrolizumab treat 35 cycle document progressive disease ( PD ) occur . Participants randomize SOC chemotherapy treat randomized study drug 4-6 cycle . After , participant non-squamous histology may choose treated maintenance pemetrexed remainder study disease progression , unacceptable adverse event ( ) ( AEs ) , intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , investigator 's decision withdraw participant , noncompliance study treatment procedure requirement , participant receive 35 treatment study treatment ( pembrolizumab arm ) , administrative reason . Participants receive pembrolizumab stop drug administration receive 35 study treatment reason disease progression intolerability , participant attain complete response stop study treatment may eligible retreatment pembrolizumab upon experience disease progression . The decision retreat second course pembrolizumab discretion Investigator participant meet criterion retreatment study ongoing . Retreatment ( second course ) limit 17 cycle . Participants randomize receive SOC chemotherapy may eligible receive pembrolizumab crossover criterion meet . Cross-Over Phase : This applicable participant randomize receive SOC . Eligible participant treat pembrolizumab remainder study disease progression , unacceptable AEs , intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , investigator 's decision withdraw participant , noncompliance study treatment procedure requirement , participant receive 35 treatment study treatment ( pembrolizumab arm ) , administrative reason .</detailed_description>
