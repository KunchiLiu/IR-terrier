	<brief_summary>Strength training find effective enhancement bone health , muscle strength body composition among premenopausal woman general population , however unclear extend strength training might improve parameter among woman eat disorder . The aim study therefore examine acute long-term effect strength training among person eat disorder . The study randomize , control , single-blinded trial three intervention group one control group . The three intervention group perform different volume strength training . The intervention period 16 week three session per week . At pretest , posttest , 6 month , 12 month 24 month follow-up , follow variable measure : bone health , muscle strength , power , body composition hormone level , physical activity level compulsivity , body awareness , quality life , eat disorder psychopathology . Qualitative in-depth interview carry explore participant ' experience strength training . The study carry Norway , perform collaboration Telemark University College , University Agder , Norwegian school sport science Modum Bad psychiatric center . The result study might implicate strength train part treatment eat disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ED mental disorder often lead serious medical complication hormone disturbance , osteopenia/osteoporosis , myopathy . More 90 % female anorexia nervosa ( AN ) osteopenia , almost 40 % osteoporosis . Osteoporosis European Union estimate cost 37 billion euro year , majority person osteoporosis untreated . Although economic analysis osteoporosis Norway lacking , prevalence osteoporosis Norway among world 's high . Strength train effective treatment osteoporosis among postmenopausal woman . Despite , evidence base knowledge strength train possible treatment-option osteopenia/osteoporosis ED lacking . Due long half-life bisphosphonates , medication must use carefully among young adult . Hence , current well-documented treatment strategy osteopenia/osteoporosis age group . Although excessive physical activity common symptom among person ED , strength training exercise modality rarely used population . In addition , restoration body weight important treatment goal underweight person ED . Such weight restoration lead alter body composition high increase adipose tissue compare lean tissue , adipose tissue often redistribute abdominal fat . Such altered body composition might increase risk cardiovascular disease increase body dissatisfaction , hence increase risk relapse . Strength train affect body composition person without ED . It therefore interest examine strength training intervention affect body dissatisfaction , hence reduce psychopathology increase quality life , among person suffer ED . Existing study strength train intervention use different repetition , set intensity . Campos et al . find repetition ( i.e . 3-5 rep x 3 set ) effective increase muscle strength compare medium ( 9-11 rep x 3 ) many repetition ( 20-28 rep x 2 ) , latter give large increase muscular endurance among healthy male . Mosti et al . find increase bone mass lumbar spine femur neck alteration blood bone marker 12 week strength training ( 3-5 rep x 4 set , 85-90 % 1RM ) among postmenopausal woman osteopenia/osteoporosis . A study use low high intensity strength train intervention last 12 month find increase bone mineral density ( BMD ) lumbar spine among healthy elderly woman . The exist study use strength training among person ED use low intensity strength training , none examine effect bone health . Two randomize control trial find effect strength training body composition , muscle strength quality life among person Anorexia Nervosa , whereas Del Valle et al . find effect quality life . The low intensity might explain lack effect latter study . It therefore need study use adequate dosage strength training among person ED . Strength train treatment method possible side effect . Such training might however lead drop blood pressure , possible side effect among person ED hypotension prevalent population compare general population . Due safety reason , aspect important map . Approaches , hypotheses choice method The following research question problem ( RQ ) define : RQ 1 : What effect different strength training regimes bone health among person ED ? RQ 2 : What effect different strength training regime body composition , hormone level , muscle strength power among person ED ? RQ 3 : What effect different strength training regime ED psychopathology , body awareness quality life among person ED ? RQ 4 : What effect different strength training regime weekly physical activity , motives physical activity compulsive exercise among person ED ? RQ 5 : What immediate effect different strength training regime blood pressure among person ED ? RQ 6 : How person ED experience use strength train part treatment ED ? RQ 7 : What long-term effect different strength training regimes bone health among person ED ? RQ 8 : What long-term effect different strength training regime body composition , hormone level , muscle strength power among person ED ? RQ 9 : What long-term effect different strength training regime ED psychopathology , body awareness quality life among person ED ? RQ 10 : What long-term effect different strength training regime weekly physical activity , motives physical activity compulsive exercise among person ED ? To examine research question , use multi-methods approach . We conduct randomize controlled trial four group ( n=200 ) , group follow 16 week intervention period two year follow-up . We use quantitative objective self-report assessment method , qualitative in-depth interview . To answer RQ 1 RQ 2 , objective assessment method dual x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) , blood sample strength test use squat bench press conduct . RQ 3 RQ 4 answer use standardized self-report instrument . Ambulatory continuous blood pressure monitor use first strength training session answer RQ 5 . RQ 6 answered select participant informant qualitative semi-structured in-depth interview . To answer RQ 7-10 , follow-up 6 month , 12 month 24 month intervention conduct . We choose randomize controlled design gold standard examine effect different treatment intervention . However , believe important take participant ' experience account , give valuable additional information clinical significance intervention . Such information valuable consider use strength training intervention clinical setting future . In evidence-based practice , essential considerate clinical expertise , wide research perspective patient ' preference subjective experience needs . This justify use multi-methods approach quantitative objective qualitative data include . Bone health promote regular weight-bearing physical activity use muscular strength power exert force skeleton normal amount . This project expand knowledge strength training use component treatment ED . Strength train several benefit person without ED , however exist study examine one important parameter , i.e . bone health . This project therefore seek ass parameter allow u explore effect strength training detail . Furthermore , examine take participant ' experience account . This important future treatment design adapt exercise individual .</detailed_description>
