	<brief_summary>1 . At University Hospital Basel , Switzerland , simplify screen group B streptococci ( GBS ) vagina perineum perform since several year . Reliable detection GBS critical prevent GBS transmission delivery antimicrobial prophylaxis . Transmission GBS neonate may otherwise lead severe infection complication neonate . Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) international organization recommend vaginal additional rectal swab.We therefore aim test simplify screen international gold standard . 2 . Antibiotic resistant bacteria may reside genital tract expect mother may transmit new-born delivery . In case infection pregnant woman neonate , application standard antimicrobial treatment insufficiently cover extend spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) produce bacteria . Therefore , colonization ESBL pregnancy need know potentially deliver adequate antimicrobial treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Simplified GBS Screening Prevalence ESBL Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transmission GBS delivery lead 1/1000 live birth severe sepsis neonate may serious sequelae include death . Most case concern early onset sepsis occur first three seven day birth . Several randomized study show antibiotic prophylaxis delivery reduces risk early onset sepsis neonate 85 % , whereas late onset sepsis affect . Accurate screen include appropriate culture method critical wealth newborn decision regard application antibiotic prophylaxis mother . In study compare simplify test algorithm take swabs vagina perineum versus combine vaginal rectal swab GBS culture current gold standard diagnosis culture yield GBS increase substantially sample take low vagina rectum compare swab vagina endocervix . There certain reluctance perform rectal swab associate discomfort . The study aim demonstrate simplify vagino-perineal swab lead similar GBS detection rate compare gold standard comprising combine vaginal rectal swab . We aim systematically assess degree discomfort rectal swab compare cost apply different method . Additionally aim determine prevalence risk factor community acquire ESBL process swabs appropriate culture medium fill standardized questionnaire . We plan prospective cohort study inclusion 450 pregnant woman attend outpatient obstetric clinic routine control third trimester .</detailed_description>
