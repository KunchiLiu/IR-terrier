	<brief_summary>Stroke 4th lead cause death United States estimate 1 death every 4 minute . On average , someone suffers stroke United States every 40th second . Stroke recur 1 4 stroke patient . About 87 % stroke result ischemic insult . The total economic burden stroke account 38.6 billion dollar per year . Stroke also one lead cause long term disability . Current stroke therapy concentrate mainly acute revascularization , sub-acute rehabilitation secondary prevention . Neuroprotection mainstay treatment modality effective regimen satisfy stroke clinician researcher . Many neuroprotection agent show excellent pre-clinical result fail clinical translation . Thus need find new treatment order decrease mortality morbidity cause stroke . The investigator hypothesize adopt narrow therapeutic window , treatment initiation first six hour , may demonstrate positive significant short long term neuroprotective effect NMDA/Glutaminergic histaminergic antagonism compare standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If subject decides take part study , subject place randomly treatment group standard care group . This mean : The subject give either treatment drug standard care stroke standard care . If subject place treatment group subject randomly administer either diphenhydramine oral injection vein 4 day dextromethorphan tablet orally 2 day . In treatment group subject receive another drug name famotidine injection vein prophylaxis prevent gastrointestinal bleeding ulceration whereas standard care group subject receive pantoprazole injection vein purpose . If subject take medication orally put tube nose subject 's stomach small intestine might also put gastric tube directly subject 's stomach surgically small cut belly . The investigator collect information medical chart include : imaging data , stroke assessment medical history . A neurological exam do , call National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) . It use assess neurologic damage cause stroke . A Modified Rankin Scale ( m-RS ) also perform scale use measure degree disability dependence daily activity stroke . The subject ask come follow-up 3 month discharge hospital follow do : 1 . Modified Rankin Scale ( m-RS ) score NIH Stroke Scale score 2 . CT MRI head without contrast</detailed_description>
