	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose recommend phase 2 dose ( MTD/RP2D ) daily oral MLN0128 ( TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 ) administer bevacizumab patient advance solid tumor include recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) . II . To evaluate overall safety tolerability combination MLN0128 bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary anti-tumor activity combination MLN0128 bevacizumab , determine response rate ( RR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . II . To assess tolerability throughout study therapy MLN0128 bevacizumab , include beyond MTD interval follow measure cumulative treatment-related toxicity : frequency toxicity lead missed dos delay ; percentage cycle give within 7 day schedule time ; percentage actual plan dosage administration ; percentage patient discontinue study drug due treatment related toxicity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) penetration MLN0128 combination bevacizumab patient recurrent GBM evaluate plasma CSF concentration MLN0128 absence presence bevacizumab . II . To perform archival tumor analysis marker dysregulated cell signaling may predict response mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor therapy epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( expression immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] amplification fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) , phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) ( expression IHC deletion FISH ) , phosphorylated ( p ) -protein kinase B ( AKT ) , p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) , p-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 ( 4EBP ) , p-mTOR p-mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( Erk ) patient recurrent GBM . III . To analyze select phosphorylated protein ( ERK , AKT , mTOR , 4EBP1 , glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta [ GSK3beta ] , ribosomal protein S6 kinase , 70kDa , polypeptide 2 [ p70S6K ] , rS6 ) tumor biopsy obtain baseline treatment MLN0128 endometrial ovarian cancer patient enrol stage 2 . IV . To analyze circulate plasma level angiogenic growth factor , treatment MLN0128 bevacizumab V. To perform genetic mutation analysis proteomic analysis tissue biopsies endometrial ovarian cancer patient include analysis Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) , v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B ( BRAF ) , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 ( AKT1 ) PTEN . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study MLN0128 . Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
