	<brief_summary>It show close control blood glucose level intensive care unit patient benefit patient morbidity mortality rate well impact upon discharge time . GlySure previously complete evaluation intra-vascular glucose monitoring system patient surgical ICU environment cardiac surgery . This study seek evaluate equipment use wider range patient range underlying condition require treatment medical ICU 's . The GlySure device consist sensor place patient 's blood central venous catheter . It measure blood glucose level continuously allow rapid control blood glucose level achieve compare exist method blood sample take repeatedly every 15 minute . The study design show sensor use protracted period time , give accurate result compare reference technique use i-STAT device . The investigator intend show device performs safely required time within ICU .</brief_summary>
