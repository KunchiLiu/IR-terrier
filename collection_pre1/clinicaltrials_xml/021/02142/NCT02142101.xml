	<brief_summary>Gut microbe influence numerous aspect human biology . Alterations function composition gut microbial flora ( gut microbiota ) link inflammatory bowel disease , chronic inflammation , dyslipidemia , diabetes mellitus , atopic disorder , cardiovascular disease , neoplasms , obesity . However , little known whether renal failure alters composition gut microbiota whether alteration gut microbiota patient renal failure impact development co-morbid condition accelerate atherosclerosis , abnormal bone mineral metabolism , chronic inflammation associate renal failure . Nonetheless , several line evidence suggest renal failure alters chemical environment intestinal lumen , could impose selective pressure growth certain gut microbe . The investigator hypothesize gut microbiota patient renal failure different without renal failure . To test hypothesis investigator conduct cross-sectional study gut microbiota patient different degree renal failure due polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Studies show gut microbe influence numerous aspect human biology , alteration function composition gut microbial flora ( microbiota ) play major role pathogenesis diverse human illnesses chronic inflammation , diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular disease . Gut microbes provide protection pathogenic organism , contribute energy metabolism , serve clear role development modulation human gut immune system , participate nitrogen micronutrient homeostasis synthesize amino acid various vitamin . However , whether composition gut microbe alter human renal failure clearly demonstrate . Furthermore , whether alteration gut microbiota due renal failure contribute development co-morbid condition associate CKD never examine . There several line evidence suggest gut microbiota likely alter patient CKD . It establish protein assimilation small intestine impair CKD . To examine impact renal failure composition gut microbiota study patient renal failure due polycystic kidney disease ( PKD ) . PKD fourth lead cause kidney failure , common genetic kidney disease . Compared patient renal failure due diabetic nephropathy , hypertension , glomerulonephritis , patient PKD virtually major co-morbid medical condition associate medical intervention ( i.e . antimicrobial anti-inflammatory therapy ) could potentially alter gut microbiota , confound interpretation data . Objectives 1 . To compare gut microbiota fecal sample PKD patient different degree renal disease . 2 . To determine whether alteration composition gut microbiota link serum level metabolite uremic solute know associated symptom uremia .</detailed_description>
