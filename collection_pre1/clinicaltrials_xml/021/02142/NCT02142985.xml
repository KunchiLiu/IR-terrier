	<brief_title>ScvO2 Based Vascular Filling Test Patients With Hemodynamic Instability</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular fill represent milestone treatment hypovolemia . Its main objective restore vascular volume correct perfusion issue prevent deleterious consequence prolong shock . Hypovolemia diagnosis easy make obvious clinical situation hemorrhagic shock , deshydratation ... , still many diagnostic difficulty regard latent hypovolemia especially associate leave ventricular dysfunction . In situation , diagnostic hypovolemia hard make investigation need . Central venous pressure ( CVP ) pulmonary occlusion artery pressure ( PAPO ) mainly use parameter indicate vascular fill actually many study underline low liability situation . Many non invasive semi invasive technique investigation , cardiac output measure pulse wave detect arteria radial catheter via specific receptor ( Flo-Trac Edwards ) connect monitor ( Vigileo ) need calibration . After vascular filling , outcome measurment need evaluate efficacity treatment . Outcome measurment base hemodynamic criterion still insufficient . In fact , tissue hypoxia persist cardio - respiratory system adapt metabolic need , 's pathway base therapeutic objective like venous oxymetry need . Theorically , fill maneuver beneficial associate ScvO2 amelioration . It reflect amelioration cardiac output predicts positive responsivness fill test .</detailed_description>
