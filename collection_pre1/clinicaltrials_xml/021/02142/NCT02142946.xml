	<brief_summary>The primary objective project track change time balance control parameter measure stance gait different group multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient . Our primary goal determine whether change balance control time predict transition MS progression disease affect state , different change time patient balance deficit due vestibular sensory disorder . A part goal also determine whether change balance control correlate change patient ' self-reported deficit similar change balance control patient peripheral vestibular loss . The secondary objective determine multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient relationship balance parameter different gait speed , order advise , promote via feedback , safe walking speed . Fulfilling first objective would lead good track MS disease change time , early quantification onset symptom suggest worsen disease status , , assume , great patient satisfaction know quantification symptom fit subjective feeling balance deficit stance gait . Achieving second objective would lead improved balance gait . We aim carry objective use equipment ( SwayStar ) proven sensitive MS induce balance deficit { 2 } , cost far less operate maintain previously use quantification tool . We aim investigate balance deficit gait different MS patient group use multimodal approach SwayStar system ( analysis balance stance gait term trunk-pelvis movement near centre mass ) patient questionnaire .</brief_summary>
