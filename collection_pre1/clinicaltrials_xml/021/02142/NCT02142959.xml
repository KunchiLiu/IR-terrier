	<brief_summary>Radiation dermatitis experience almost patient ( 95 % ) receiving radiation therapy cancer . Radiation dermatitis serious condition , addition direct physical complication result impact overall quality life , also dose-limiting toxicity require change prescribe course radiation therapy . The common strategy employ attempt prevent minimize radiation dermatitis involve moisturization irradiated area , use mild soap keep area clean , minimize exposure potential mechanical irritant , scratch rough clothing . However , strategy show lack clinically significant efficacy . Consequently , clinical need new treatment effective protect radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress subsequent development radiation dermatitis . Based data previous study animal human , Reata believe omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) Lotion may effectively prevent mitigate radiation dermatitis oncology patient undergo radiation therapy . This randomized , double-blind , vehicle-controlled , parallel-group trial study efficacy , tolerability safety two concentration omaveloxolone ( RTA 408 ) Lotion ( 3 % 0.5 % ) versus vehicle patient breast cancer radiation therapy recommend .</brief_summary>
