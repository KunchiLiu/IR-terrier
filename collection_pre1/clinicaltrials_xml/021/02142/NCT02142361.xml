	<brief_title>Clinical Performance Habitual Hydrogel vs. Silicone Hydrogel Toric Contact Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 60-subject , single mask , bilateral , parallel study design compare fit characteristic enfilcon A toric lenses subject habitual hydrogel toric lens ( omafilcon A , ocufilcon D methafilcon B wearer ) . Subject 's habitual toric lens evaluate first visit re-fitted pair Avaira toric lens . After 1 week daily wear , subject return second final evaluation .</detailed_description>
