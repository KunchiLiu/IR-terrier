	<detailed_description>The vaccine test study call norovirus GI.1/GII.4 bivalent virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine adjuvanted without monophosphoryl lipid A ( MPL ) aluminum hydroxide . The norovirus vaccine test provide additional safety immunogenicity data enable vaccine develop . This study look side effect people take different formulation norovirus vaccine . The study enroll approximately 450 participant . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one 3 treatment groups—which remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - one dose GI.1/GII.4 ( 15 µg/50 µg ) adjuvanted MPL ( 50 µg ) aluminum hydroxide ( 500 µg ) Day 1 follow one dose GI.1/GII.4 ( 15 µg/15 µg ) adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide ( 500 µg ) ( without MPL ) Day 365 - one dose GI.1/GII.4 ( 50 µg/50 µg ) adjuvanted MPL ( 50 µg ) aluminum hydroxide ( 500 µg ) Day 1 follow one dose GI.1/GII.4 ( 15 µg/15 µg ) adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide ( 500 µg ) ( without MPL ) Day 365 - one dose Saline Placebo ( dummy inactive injection ) - liquid active ingredient-on Day 1 + GI.1/GII.4 ( 15 µg/15 µg ) adjuvanted aluminum hydroxide ( 500 µg ) ( without MPL ) primary vaccination Day 365 All participant administer vaccine placebo Day 1 study receive vaccination dose ( reduced antigen content ) norovirus vaccine Day 365 . Participants ask record symptom may relate vaccine injection site diary card 7 day vaccination . This multi-center trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study 18 month . Participants make 11 visit clinic include follow-up visit 6 month last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
