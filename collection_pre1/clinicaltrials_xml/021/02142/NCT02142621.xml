	<brief_summary>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) common complication extreme preterm birth . It impact 10,000-15,000 infant US annually , include approximately 50 % infant birth weight &lt; 1000g . BPD associate multiple long-term adverse outcome include chronic cardiopulmonary neurodevelopmental impairment . Infants severe BPD , define need ≥ 30 % inspired oxygen and/or mechanical respiratory support 36 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) , suffer great burden chronic sequela . Recurrent episodes hypoxemia prolonged exposure supplemental oxygen link development impairment . Gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) contribute mechanisms exacerbate pulmonary inflammation induce bronchospasm . Unfortunately , clinically available method diagnose GER infant unreliable . Moreover , acid suppressive agent ineffective carry high risk serious life-threatening morbidity . Simple transpyloric feeding promise , evaluate BPD . This study pilot N-of-1 trial assess whether transpyloric feed reduce airway complication GER whether methodology aid identify individual infant severe BPD likely benefit prolong use transpyloric feed . Aim 1 . To determine enrol infant severe BPD whether transpyloric compare gastric feed reduce number daily intermittent hypoxemic event ( primary outcome ) improve validate BPD severity score ( secondary outcome ) . The investigator hypothesize 80 % percent enrol infant significantly few daily intermittent hypoxemic event transpyloric compare gastric feed feed method formally recommend . Aim 2 . To pool result multiple N-of-1 trial determine whether transpyloric compare gastric feed reduce airway complication GER infant severe BPD . The investigator hypothesize transpyloric compare gastric feed associate overall 15 % reduction number daily intermittent hypoxemic event .</brief_summary>
