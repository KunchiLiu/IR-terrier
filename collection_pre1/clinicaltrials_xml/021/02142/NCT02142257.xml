	<brief_title>Comparison Gastric Bypass AspireAssist Aspiration Therapy Treatment Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity increase rapidly Sweden great threat future public health . Obesity , define accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) body mass index ( BMI ) great 30 kg/m2 , intractable disease healthcare today . Obesity result reduce life expectancy increase morbidity . Weight reduction lifestyle change different pharmacological preparation many study make last long term result . Obesity surgery far way achieve permanent weight loss . During 1980s , restrictive procedure perform , e.g. , vertical band gastro-plasty ( VBG ) good unfortunately transient effect . Later develop , prevalent gastric bypass procedure ( GBP ) today use keyhole technique cause combine restrictive mal-absorptive change gastrointestinal anatomy . GBP currently standard method clinical practice surgical treatment morbid obesity ( i.e. , BMI 35 ) . GBP procedure reversible , entail certain pre - postoperative risk . GBP quickly bring sharp reduction weight also regression diabetes mellitus type 2 . Unfortunately , surgery cause lifelong mal-absorption requirement vitamin mineral supplement . Swedish Obese Subjects study ( SOS ) emanate Gothenburg first control intervention study overweight individual . Approximately 4000 patient include , half surgical , half treat optimally , without surgery . The patient follow 10-20 year . Total mortality 24 % low surgical group . A new alternative approach obesity surgery , AspireAssist™ Aspiration Therapy System ( CE Marked ) , come United States method individual empty digesta stomach . Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) use internationally since early 1980s nutrition therapy stroke cancer . In gastroscopy tube place stomach abdominal wall nutrition administer via tube directly stomach . Aspiration treatment AspireAssist™ empty food stomach every meal lose weight . Using valve mechanism associate tube set water reservoir individual empty digesta toilet 20 minute meal lose approximately 30 % caloric intake diet . A 1 -year study Karlskrona , Sweden , show significant reduction weight , almost 40 % Excess Weight Loss ( % EWL ) reduction median weight reduction 16.5 kg 6 month . For GBP weight reduction 1 year order 70-85 % . During 1 year treatment AspireAssist™ serious complication problem body 's electrolyte balance note either surgery follow-up . The advantage method completely reversible individual wish continue aspiration may tube stomach remove . GBP result stomach become disconnect accessible diagnosis , example , ulcer , bleeding , tumor gall stone . AspireAssist™ lasting change anatomy thus lead potential internal hernia GBP unfortunately cause . Wound infection occur approximately 9 % case PEG tube place patient cancer stroke . Wound infection , case , treatable antibiotic tablet form rarely consider serious complication . Antibiotics routinely give conjunction PEG insertion . Very unusual complication leakage associate insertion PEG method report risk 2 % PEG insertion . For individual get help change habit lifestyle , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) include treatment concept AspireAssist™ . CBT program run six month include group meeting individual conversation individual assignment meeting . Group meeting cover follow theme : motivation , vision workshop , self-esteem , thought management , stress , learn eat consciously , prevent manage relapse . The program use calorie reduce method since scientific evidence provide permanent result base CBT . The program enhance awareness mental training , method show good result stress-related condition . Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) one study show change brain activity participant activity shift area frontal lobe active stress , anxiety depression area regulate peace , joy curiosity . Randomization clinical trial ( RCT ) best way implement comparative study . But AspireAssist™ method aim patient want dare operate Gastric Bypass Procedure ( GBP ) therefore fails randomization . We therefore recruit patient clinic 's wait list accept planned GBP group come exist wait list Aspire method treat obesity . This group include patient express clearly willing dare operate GBP , instead wish receive treatment Aspire method morbid obesity . There new statistical method compare two group observational study good statistically significant manner Stata version 13 handle well match so-called covariates ( e.g. , study may covariates follow variable baseline : age , gender , preoperative weight , BMI , concomitant disease diabetes ) . Patients match comparison do match group . Calculation treatment effect , include so-called propensity score exploitation already use comparative study GBP bariatric surgery obesity neither able randomize patient ( Carlin et al Annals Surgery , Vol . 257 , Number 5 , May 2013 : 791-7 )</detailed_description>
