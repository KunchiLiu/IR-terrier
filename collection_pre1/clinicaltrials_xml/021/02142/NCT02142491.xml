	<brief_title>Clinical Tolerance Live Attenuated Vaccine Against Influenza ( Flumist® ) Population Allergic Eggs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TITLE : Clinical tolerance live , attenuated influenza vaccine ( FluMist® ) context influenza immunization population egg-allergic child : A pilot project . Protocol # : FluMist240713 . 1 . INTRODUCTION In Canada , flu vaccine indicate child 6 23 month age . Epidemiologic clinical study demonstrate child high risk complication high rate hospitalisation due influenza . Trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) , administer intramuscularly , long used preventative vaccination population . FluMist® live attenuate influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) administrate intranasally , approve use Canada since 2010 [ 1 ] . Besides avoid inconvenience anxiety relate intramuscular vaccine , FluMist® offer good protection influenza TIV . The Canadian National Advisory Committee Immunization ( NACI ) recommend preferential use LAIV TIV influenza immunization child 24 month old . Furthermore , LAIV use favour child chronic disease suffer non-severe asthma [ 2 ] . The influenza vaccine manufacture use chicken egg embryo , contain minimal residual quantity ovalbumin ( egg protein ) . In patient egg allergy , numerous clinical study demonstrate administration safe little risk anaphylactic reaction . Therefore , egg allergy longer contra-indication receive TIV patient receive vaccine without precaution CLSCs doctor ' office [ 3 ,4 ] . There study safety LAIV administration egg-allergic patient . As egg-allergic patient often atopic related comorbidities asthma , increased protection influenza achieve LAIV desirable . The egg protein content LAIV comparable TIV administration intranasal rather systemic . Therefore , reasonable hypothesize LAIV administration egg-allergic patient safe TIV administration population . Yet , recommend LAIV egg-allergic patient , study safety population essential . 1.1 Use eggs production influenza vaccine Because virus obligate intracellular parasite , vaccine virus must produce use human animal cell . Influenza vaccine currently use Canada produce allow virus multiply chicken egg embryo . Despite rigorous purification process , vaccine , include Flumist® , still contain low residual quantity ovalbumin ( egg protein ) . The quantity residual ovalbumin differs , time significantly , different commercial influenza vaccine available Canada , also different lot vaccine [ 3 ] . While manufacturer assure influenza vaccine destine Canadian market contain 0.24 µg/dose residual ovalbumin [ ] , require divulge final quantity . For reason , theoretical risk anaphylaxis hypersensitivity still exist egg-allergic patient . However , real risk anaphylactic reaction intramuscular influenza vaccination egg-allergic patent quite low [ 1 ] . 1.2 Prevalence clinical presentation egg allergy Egg allergy one common food allergy [ 6 ] . Studies demonstrate 1 2 % young child could allergic egg , represent approximately 800 child 12 23 month age group Quebec [ 7 ,8 ] . This allergy often diagnose around 18 month age , egg introduce child 's diet . Almost half egg-allergic child identify around 10 month age [ 9 ,10 ] . We estimate allergy completely disappear age 5 66 % allergic child 7 year age 75 % [ 11 ,12 ] . In last decade , duration egg hypersensitivity seem increase late childhood sometimes adolescence [ 13 ] . Persistent egg allergy adulthood rare . Persistent egg allergy essentially remain paediatric issue . We , therefore , estimate Quebec , 3000 egg-allergic child 1 9 year age . The clinical presentation egg allergy varies significantly . The sign symptom IgE mediate allergic reaction touch many system variable intensity , range mild severe . Symptoms occur within minute several hour ingestion egg-containing product , majority allergic reaction occur within 30 minute contact [ 9 ] . The incidence severe allergic reaction ( anaphylaxis ) egg rare . We estimate 7 10 % declare anaphylactic reaction due egg protein [ 14 ] . 2 . SAFETY OF VACCINES IN EGG-ALLERGIC PATIENTS 2.1 Safety influenza vaccine egg-allergic patient In 1976 , outbreak porcine H1N1 influenza A observed American army recruitment camp Fort Dix , New Jersey . Despite outbreak relatively limited recruitment camp , American health authority implement , general population , massive vaccination campaign influenza strain . Before abruptly stop increase number case Guillain-Barre syndrome , 48 million people vaccination disease . Jointly mass vaccination campaign , CDC implement national surveillance program post-vaccination side effect 11 case post vaccination anaphylaxis register . None case occur egg-allergic patient . However , unaware number people vaccinate egg allergy , limit scope observe result . Studies complete thereafter egg-allergic child tend demonstrate vaccine could safely administer . A review literature 27 study prior 2012 ( table 1 ) consist 4172 egg-allergic patient vaccinate TVI publish group [ 3 ] . Amongst patient , case severe allergic reaction observe . The common observe allergic reaction mild ( local erythema , local distal urticaria , mildly wheezy breathing ) , though 1 patient present generalize urticaria . Since , study subject publish . More specifically , study Greemhawt et al [ 15 ] demonstrate via retrospective prospective cohort , safety single dose TIV vaccination severely egg-allergic patient . Finally , multicenter study conduct group 5 influenza vaccine season permit well estimate risk allergic reaction . Four hundred fifty-seven dos trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine administer 367 patient 132 ( 153 dos ) report severe allergic reaction egg [ 4 ] . Four patient report possible mild reaction secondary previous influenza vaccine ( 1 urticaria , 2 vomit 1 eczema ) , severe allergic reaction observe study . Thirteen patient develop mild allergic appear symptom 24 hour follow vaccine administration none 367 patient develop anaphylactic reaction . Using 95 % confidence interval ( Clopper-Pearson exact CI ) , obtain result study allow u estimate risk anaphylaxis 0 0.08 % ( 0 1 1250 dos ) global population egg-allergic patient 0 0.62 % ( 0 1 161 dos ) patient history severe allergic reaction egg . Following study , Quebec immunisation protocol ( PIQ ) amend permit administration influenza vaccine egg-allergic patient single dose usual vaccination center . Since change implement PIQ , case anaphylaxis death report population . 2.2 Safety LAIV ( Flumist® ) Two formulation FluMist® study worldwide : frozen ( 0.5ml/dose ) refrigerate ( 0.2ml/dose ) . These 2 formulation produce viral strain comparable degree clinical efficacy . However , refrigerate ( 0.2ml/dose ) formulation authorise use Canada . FluMist® compose attenuated virus replicate temperature nasal mucosa . The often reported side effect nasal congestion rhinorrhea . Since people receive vaccine excrete virus nasal secretion day follow vaccination , recommend avoid vaccine immunocompromised patient healthcare worker contact immunocompromised patient . Furthermore , recommend avoid vaccine patient severe asthma ( define individual oral corticosteroid therapy high dose inhale corticosteroid individual wheeze auscultation ) ( see section 3.4 ) egg-allergic patient ( see section 3.3 ) . 2.3 Safety LAIV ( Flumist® ) egg-allergic patient : risk associate potential allergen administer intranasally When quantity residual ovalbumine measure independent laboratory , low quantity find , range 0.00013 0.0017 µg per 0.2ml dose . The quantity egg protein find intranasal vaccine therefore , similar find TVI . Given different mode administration TIV LAIV ( intramuscular versus intranasal ) , important underline potentially different absorption ovalbumin impact risk allergic reaction . Some study analyze absorption physiologic response food allergen administer intranasally . More specifically , Clark et al [ 16 ] use method intranasal peanut provocation allergic patient evaluate thermographic change nasal temperature . In double-blinded provocation study , 10 µg sterilize peanut extract use nasal provocation among 16 patient , none present systemic symptom . Taking account quantity ovalbumin LAIV usually less 0.24 µg per dose [ 1 ] , theoretic dose food allergen 40 time higher Clark et al study , risk allergic reaction associate administration LAIV egg-allergic population seem low . Moreover , systemic absorption intranasally administer medication compare oral form , much less important [ 17 ] . Ratner et al [ 18 ] demonstrate absorption beclomethasone approximately four time less administer intranasally . The quantity ovalbumine truly absorb probably significantly less 0.24 µg contain LAIV . 2.4 Safety Flumist® asthmatic patient Unlike American recommendation suggest avoid LAIV asthmatic patient [ 19 ] , National Advisory Committee Immunization ( NACI ) Public Health Agency Canada ( PHAC ) recommend vaccine asthmatic patient except severe asthma define asthmatic individual oral corticosteroid high dose inhale corticosteroid asthmatic individual wheeze auscultation [ 4 ] . Unlike American recommendation , Health Canada recommendation base recent study . Many study demonstrate efficacy safety use LAIV population moderately severely stable asthmatic individual . In 2003 , Flemming et al [ 20 ] demonstrate 2000 asthmatic child adolescent well efficacy LAIV well asthma exacerbation rate similar TIV . Furthermore , Redding et al [ 21 ] study safety LAVI 1997 48 patient 9 17 year old moderate severe stable asthma . The percentage change force expiratory volume ( FEV1 ) evaluate fifth day similar vaccinate placebo group ( 0.2 % versus 0.4 % , p=0.78 ) . 2.5 Intradermic test flu vaccine Intradermic testing flu vaccine detect egg-allergic patient great risk develop allergic reaction administration flu vaccine . Therefore , use recommend [ 22 ] . 3 . AIM The aim study verify clinical tolerance inactivate , attenuate flu vaccine ( Flumist® ) egg-allergic population . More specifically , estimate risk severe allergic reaction 24 hour follow vaccination Flumist® egg-allergic patient . 4 . METHODS 4.1 Population : 4.1.1 Case group 4.1.1.1 Inclusion criterion Children 2 17 year age confirm egg allergy flu vaccine indicate consider high risk desire protection flu virus . 4.1.1.2 Confirmation egg allergy Confirmation egg allergy require set criterion vary depend whether ever eat egg . 4.1.1.3 Patients already eat egg must meet follow 2 condition : 1 . Patients must experience 60 minute follow ingestion one sign symptom list : Mild sings/symptoms : 1 ) Cutaneous pruritis mild urticaria ( le 5 urticarial plaque ) erythema 2 ) Rhinorrhea , sneeze nasal congestion 3 ) Pruritis , erythema , edema tear 4 ) Throat palate pruritis 5 ) Dyspnea ( objectify ) 6 ) Vomiting diarrhea Moderate severe signs/symptoms : 1 . Facial angioedema 2 . Systemic urticaria ( 5 urticarial plaque ) 3 . Objectified dyspnea respiratory distress 4 . Wheezy breathe 5 . Cough 6 . Weakness alter level consciousness 7 . All reaction require administration epinephrine 2. confirmation allergy one follow method within 6 month reaction : 1. positive egg skin prick test ( diameter induration &gt; 3 mm negative control ( saline ) read 10 15 minute procedure ) . 2. specific egg IgE level &gt; 0.35 kIU/L 4.1.1.4 In patient never consume eggs egg contain product uncertain clinical history reaction egg , diagnosis must confirm follow 2 method 6 month follow reaction : 1. positive egg skin pric test 2. specific egg IgE level measure ImmunoCAP : &gt; 2kIU/L child less 2 year old &gt; 7kIU/L child 2 year old . 4.1.1.5 Exclusion criterion We could vaccinate patient follow condition . However , condition temporary reversible . Therefore , vaccination must do moment situation improve . Exclusion criterion : 1. poorly control asthma day vaccination define presence wheezy breathe and/or cough time vaccination wheeze auscultation ; 2. severe asthma define individual oral corticosteroid high dose inhaled corticosteroid ; 3. presence urticarial rash physical exam ; 4. use antihistamine ( first second generation ) 3 7 day ( respectively ) vaccination ; 5. presence moderate severe acute illness ( example , fever , irritability , inconsolable cry , lethargy , abnormal fatigue , vomit , diarrhea , pallor , cyanosis diaphoresis ) ; 6. immunocompromised patient healthcare worker contact immunocompromised patient . 4.1.2 Control group 100 individual without history egg allergy , never receive intranasal flu vaccine recruit . These control subject recruit manner allow similar age distribution allergic patient . 4.1.2.1 Inclusion criterion Children 2 17 year age without history egg allergy indication flu vaccine consider risk complication desire protection flu virus . 4.1.2.2 Exclusion criterion They case group . See section 4.1.1.5 . 4.1.3 Identification patient Allergic patient contact start October inform project . This include : 1 . Known allergic patient contacted allergist ; 2 . Patients pediatricians general practitioner inform project refer ; 3 . The department allergy immunology send know egg-allergic patient letter inform project invite take appointment clinic . These patient identify , among thing , list positive egg specific IgE level do last 24 month ; 4 . As need , ad project , write medium electronically , could use . Controls recruit allergy clinic Ste-Justine hospital . These patient may follow allergy egg allergy . Controls may also recruit ad social medium service . 4.2 Clinical procedure On vaccination day , participant follow procedure : 1 . A research nurse explain parent participant expect context project . She ask patient read consent form project . She mention follow-up telephone 24 hour vaccination ask clinical status child . Those accept sign consent form . If accept , vaccinate use TIV accord current recommendation Quebec public health . 2 . In context clinical approach service , parent fill auto-administered questionnaire clinical history child 's egg allergy . This questionnaire take approximately 15 minute complete . The allergist verify answer parent proceed examine child include examination skin pulmonary auscultation 30 minute prior vaccination . For control subject , physical exam also do allergist clinic . 3 . For child egg allergy , clinical revaluation ( skin prick test egg specific IgE level ImmunoCap ) do late value 6 month old adequately document . This test take approximately 15 minute . 4 . The vaccine use live , attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) i.e Flumist® AstraZeneca . As egg allergen ( ovalbumin ) content LAIV comparable intramuscularly administer vaccine risk allergic reaction TIV show low administer single dose , intranasal vaccine Flumist® administer nurse doctor single dose 0.2ml intranasally , recommend manufacturer . This vaccination follow 60 minute observation period . We examine child 60 minute vaccination time child , parent personnel suspect allergic reaction adverse effect . The wait time vaccination occur wait room allergy clinic supervision nurse . We ask parent child inform doctor nurse observe follow manifestation : erythema , pruritis , rash , sneeze , rhinorrhea , tear , nasal congestion , voice change , cough , difficulty breathing , noisy breathing , pallor , weakness , vomit diarrhea . We ask also advise member research team reaction concern state . 5 . Before leave , parent question presence allergic symptom . If reaction occur , treat base allergist supervision doctor decision . The allergy clinic vaccination occur equip necessary material treat allergic reaction i.e . epinephrine , oral injectable diphenhydramine , inhaled salbutamol , oral intravenous corticosteroid oxygen . 6 . Telephone follow-up All parent receive emergency phone number contact case allergic reaction within 24 hour follow vaccination . This contact information principal investigator project , Dr Anne Des Roches , allergist call absent . Moreover , phone number also provide telephonist Ste-Justine Hospital call Dr Des Roches allergist call . She ( ) evaluate patient biphasic reaction delay reaction could patient come allergy clinic refer patient emergency department accord situation . Parents advise contact emergency service first severe delay reaction . Parents call follow day enquire presence allergic manifestation could appear 24 hour follow vaccination . 4.2.1 Second dose Children 2 8 year age , never receive trivalent seasonal flu vaccine tolerate first dose , invited second appointment receive booster dose , 1 month later . The second dose follow observation period 15 minute . 4.3 Sample size As pilot project , aim recruit 100 egg-allergic patient 100 control patient . According result , multicentre study large number egg-allergic patient could do later time . 4.4 Primary outcome statistical analysis The primary outcome presence anaphylactic reaction follow flu vaccination LAIV . An anaphylactic reaction define accord Brighton Collaboration criterion , international organization standardises criteria define vaccine side effect [ 23 ] . Secondary outcome presence allergic manifestation describe section 4.1.1.3 within 24 hour follow flu vaccination . We compare proportion patient control present allergic symptom use exact Fisher test . We estimate risk anaphylaxis 95 % confidence interval use Clopper-Pearson exact method . 4.5 Schedule surveillance study This study conduct period 6 month , i.e . October 2013 March 2014 , correspond flu vaccination period . An analysis data pertain anaphylactic reaction compile regularly study 's principal investigator . The study cease one follow situation occur study : - child develop fatal almost fatal reaction ; - 2 % child develop reaction require epinephrine administration . 5 . Risks benefit study For egg-allergic patient desire flu vaccine , risk participation study risk develop allergic reaction follow Flumist® vaccination . Although nasal congestion , rhinorrhea cough common report side effect patient receive vaccine , allergic reaction occurs , could manifest important nasal symptom ( congestion , rhinorrhea , pruritis , sneeze , edema ) , well oral symptom systemic symptom , accompany pruritis , urticaria , wheezy breathing , severe case , hypotension , throat swell tightness and/or difficulty breathe . An allergic reaction also present nausea , abdominal pain and/or sudden vomiting . Patients monitor closely whole procedure , well hour follow onset symptom . If need , see study doctor evaluate need antihistamine , epinephrine , corticosteroid institute specialize technique maintain vital function . The risk severe reaction probably low consider low egg content vaccine . For control group , additional medical risk participate study , receive seasonal flu vaccine manner would participate study supplemental procedure necessary except observation period 60 minute , follow-up telephone call 24 hour vaccination short medical questionnaire . Aside stringent observation reaction vaccine , control encounter direct benefit participation study . For case participant , intranasal flu vaccine allow obtain good protection seasonal flu vaccine receive TIV . Furthermore , result obtain confirm safety FluMist® egg-allergic patient , allow reassurance healthcare professional safety vaccination egg-allergic patient . More long term , allow egg-allergic patient receive LAIV rather limit TIV . 6 . Medications investigation The FluMist® vaccine make AstraZeneca provide rout Ste-Justine Hospital National Institute Public Health specific storage condition set manufacturer . The vaccines condition require manufacturer Ste-Justine research center , responsibility principal investigator . The Ste-Justine research center equip refrigerator temperature control monitor , allow verification change temperature report principal investigator . Vaccines store safe secure environment . Information pertain arrival vaccine , dos administer return destruction ( warrant ) vaccine document . 7 . Protection data The data compile study anonymized enter Excel database . The database keep Ste-Justine computer access research team . The computer username password protect situate locked office . 8 . Adverse reaction medication report In study , Canadian regulation apply report serious adverse effect . For medication use context clinical trial Canada , serious unexpected adverse effect must rapidly report Health Canada . Serious expect adverse effect serious therapeutic incident observe clinical trial consider secondary product question , whether expect , require expedited reporting . A report complete following case : - 15 day follow moment situation know , effect fatal put patient 's life danger ; - soon possible 7 day follow moment situation know , death occurs effect put patient 's life danger ; - 8 day follow notification Health Canada adverse effect , detailed report contain estimation importance repercussion finding . Each case adverse effect subject expedite declaration undergo distinct declaration consist element require Health Canada guidelines/ICH E2A : Clinical Safety Data Management : Definitions Standards Expedited Reporting . Data pertain harmlessness medication communicate ongoing process research ethic committee . 9 . Surveillance data security committee A committee monitor security collect data shall form professional implicate elaboration protocol . The regulation set Health Canada shall follow . The primary responsibility committee shall follow : 1 . Periodic meeting ( approximately every 2 month necessary ) evaluate study result respect security , management study progress recruitment . 2 . To elaborate recommendation continuation , modification cessation study . 3 . To evaluation compile serious adverse effect . 10 . Ethics Parents wish sign consent form get child vaccinate TIV accord regular clinical protocol recommend Quebec public health . The information consent form explain control group must remain clinic long period time vaccination would normally require ( 60 versus 15 minute ) fill short medical questionnaire well receive follow-up phone call . The safety patient assure provide vaccination center equip necessary material personnel rapidly respond anaphylactic reaction , rapid access emergency department close observation . Questionnaire identify number number use database ensure confidentiality . 11 . Schedule June 2013 Submission ethic committee 30 October 2013 Start vaccination 12 .
