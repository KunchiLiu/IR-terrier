	<brief_summary>A recent analysis 4500 cardiac surgical patient Royal Infirmary Edinburgh confirm acute kidney injury ( AKI ) relatively common post-operative complication associate prolonged hospital stay , increase risk death . There currently specific therapy available except supportive care . In laboratory study , heme arginate ( HA ) , drug license human use , show upregulate anti-inflammatory enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 ( HO-1 ) protect age mouse acute kidney injury . This study bring research human arena . It aim evaluate minimum effective dose HA verify safety specific group patient . This next step investigate HA could potential protective treatment reduce AKI patient cardiac surgery . Patients due cardiac surgery age 60 approached inclusion study . If agreeable , randomly assign receive either HA dose 1mg/kg 3mg/kg . There 10 patient group . Blood test take study drug give , 6 hour , 24 hour 7 day post dose . These sample use examine effect HA HO-1 different dos , verify drug safety . Any adverse effect drug evaluate , although HA excellent safety profile use currently license acute porphyria . Urine sample also collect assess inflammation quantify urinary biomarkers AKI . This set scene randomise clinical trial HA cardiac surgical patient high risk AKI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AKI common condition carry significant morbidity mortality current treatment except supportive care . Cardiac surgery remain standard care revascularisation severe coronary artery disease despite improvement percutaneous coronary intervention . The nature surgery confers ischaemic renal insult follow AKI relatively common complication . However , report incidence AKI post cardiac surgery vary widely depend diagnostic criterion use . A recent retrospective analysis 4572 cardiac surgical patient Royal Infirmary Edinburgh 5 year period show 12.4 % develop AKI AKIN criterion post operatively . This associate increase risk death prolong inpatient stay . Pre-clinical study murine model ischaemia reperfusion injury ( IRI ) demonstrate anti-inflammatory enzyme HO-1 interest potential target therapeutic intervention . Heme arginate ( HA ) drug license human use , treatment acute porphyria . HA upregulates HO-1 , ameliorate IRI give injury murine model IRI . In Phase I clinical trial , HA show upregulate HO-1 well tolerate . This single-blinded randomised trial Heme arginate ( HA ) patient due cardiac surgery . The aim study investigate efficacy HA HO-1 upregulation safety patient cohort . This inform clinical trial HA preventative treatment AKI patient undergo cardiac surgery . Methods Eligible patient plan elective cardiac surgery , identify Cardiothoracic outpatient clinic assessment , age 60 . HA ( 3mg/kg ) upregulates HO-1 mRNA 2-fold 24 hour post dose healthy young volunteer . Power calculation base 80 % power ( p &lt; 0.05 ) detect least 2 fold upregulation HO-1 protein western blot necessitate 2 group 10 ( assume standard deviation ( SD ) ±1.5x ) . 20 patient recruit ( 10 per group ) . Patients agree participate invite study visit Clinical Research Facility Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( RIE ) . If consent give , participant randomise receive HA dose either 1 3mg/kg ( maximum 250mg ) . Prior dose give , routine observation ( include blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation temperature ) take , trial team member perform routine examination cardiac respiratory system . An electrocardiogram ( ecg ) do reference . Blood sample assess HO-1 expression circulate monocyte take prior administration study drug , 24 hour post dose . Samples routine blood test include full blood count ( FBC ) , urea electrolyte ( U &amp; E ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , liver function test ( LFT ) , ferritin take alongside monocyte isolation , set day 7 . Serum ( urine ) frozen batch analysis monocyte isolate in-house protocol . Routine blood test process biochemistry haematology laboratory RIE per usual method . Urine sample collect study drug give , 24 hour 7 day post dose . Urinalysis perform , microalbuminuria urinary biomarkers tubular injury neutrophil gelatinase associate lipocalin ( NGAL ) , interleukin 18 ( IL-18 ) &amp; kidney injury molecule 1 ( KIM-1 ) quantify . Routine clinical observation carry 6 hour post dose , time patient allow home absence adverse event . A second study visit Clinical Research Facility schedule 24 hour post dose ( day 1 ) , third study visit day 7 . The second third study visit allow report adverse event , well opportunity perform routine observation take blood sample HO-1 induction order analyse safety . All patient genotyped short long repeat HO-1 promoter polymorphism ( either homozygous heterozygous ) though show affect HO-1 induction HA previous study . The RIE cardiac surgery unit perform approximately 1000 case per year , le 80 % age 60 analysis 4572 patient . A conservative estimate time meet recruitment study 3 month .</detailed_description>
