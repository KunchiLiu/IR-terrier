	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Plus Belinostat Relapsed/Refractory NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator look high dose study drug administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participant NHL , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose participant get depend number participant enrol study prior dose tolerate . - Study Drug ( ) : Both carfilzomib belinostat give vein participant 's arm ( IV infusion ) . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) . - Carfilzomib give Days 1-2 , 8-9 , 15-16 cycle . The carfilzomib infusion give 10 minute first cycle . However dose increased course trial , one group join study high dose level , infusion last 30 minute . All participant remain clinic observation least 1 hour follow dose carfilzomib Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Day 1 dose . - Belinostat give Days 1-5 cycle . The belinostat infusion give 30 minute . - Clinical Exams : During cycle participant physical exam ask question general health specific question problem medication may take . - Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood test : One main reason study find high dose study drug combination use safely without experience severe side effect use future study . Once dose find ( maximum tolerate dose , MTD ) , additional blood sample draw small set participant ( 5 participant total ) learn activity study drug body period time , include way study drug absorb , distribute , release body . If participate group ( participant inform Investigator ) pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample draw repeatedly period 24 hour certain day : Blood sample draw 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 minute , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 24 hour study drug dose Days 1-2 , 4-5 , 9 Cycle 1 . - Scans ( Imaging test ) : Tumor assessment CT PET CT scan every 8 week ( every cycle ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologically confirm relapsed refractory nonHodgkin lymphoma candidate standard curative therapy . NHL subtypes include : Diffuse large Bcell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , Mantle cell lymphoma , Marginal zone lymphoma , Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma , Peripheral Tcell lymphoma , Follicular lymphoma grade . Patients must receive least one prior systemic therapy lymphoma . A washout period least 3 week require recent prior therapy . Age ≥18 year ECOG performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % , see Appendix A ) Participants must organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL platelets ≥75,000/mcL total bilirubin ≤ 2 × institutional upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit normal creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 participant creatinine level institutional normal . Participants may either measurable nonmeasurable disease , case eligible patient must disease clinically evaluated improvement progression . Patients must fully recover major surgery acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy radiotherapy ( residual grade 1 toxicity , e.g. , grade 1 peripheral neuropathy , residual alopecia allow ) . The effect carfilzomib belinostat develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Men treat enrol protocol must also agree use adequate contraception prior study , duration study participation , 4 month completion study drug administration . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 3 week ( 8 week radioimmunotherapy ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 3 week earlier . Participants receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition carfilzomib belinostat Patients systemic fungal , bacterial , viral , infection control Pregnant lactating patient . Prior history another malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ cervical breast cancer , prostate cancer detectable PSA ) unless disease free one year Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Congestive heart failure severity ( NYHA class IIV ) Any active angina unstable angina pectoris myocardial infarction within one year study entry . Left ventricular ejection fraction lower limit normal Greater grade 1 peripheral neuropathy baseline Congenital long QT syndrome history torsades de pointes Baseline QTc interval &gt; 500 msec Concomitant medication require dosing day increase risk torsades de pointes Subjects know HIV infection Active hepatitis B C infection Known history allergy Captisol® ( cyclodextrin derivative use solubilize carfilzomib ) Contraindication require concomitant drug supportive treatment , include hypersensitivity anticoagulation antiplatelet option , antiviral drug , intolerance hydration due preexist pulmonary cardiac impairment Subjects pleural effusion require thoracentesis ascites require paracentesis within 14 day prior randomization</criteria>
