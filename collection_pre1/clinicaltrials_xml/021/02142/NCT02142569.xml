	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect palm-oil derive tocotrienol ( TRF ) supplement Chinese red yeast rice ( CRYR ) individually combination blood cholesterol , particularly LDL cholesterol , individual either elevate normal cholesterol level . Tocotrienols member vitamin E family , find barley , oat , rye , coconut oil rice bran oil , richest source tocotrienols palm oil . Certain tocotrienols show effective lowering LDL ( 'bad ' ) cholesterol , adverse effect HDL ( 'good ' ) cholesterol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Supplement Derived From Palm Oil Cholesterol Levels Chinese Red Yeast Rice Blood</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study design determine whether dietary supplement , tocotrienol-enriched fraction palm oil ( TRF ) enhance effect botanical supplement , Chinese Red Yeast Rice ( CRYR ) . Originally , CRYR sell dietary supplement United States 2001 . Since time , CRYR contain monacolin K chemically identical mevinolin sell Mevacor ( patent ) classify unapproved drug . At present time , many brand CRYR sell counter drug store warehouse chain U.S . However , none amount Monacolin K find CRYR subject FDA action 2001 none proven effective lower cholesterol . FDA monitor level monacolin K counter supplement limit approve level less 2 mg effective dos 6 10 mg , study use . two capsule per day capsule contain 3 mg mevinolin Monacolin K. The capsule also contain rice CRYR ferment total mass 600 mg per capsule total daily dose 1200mg . The study originally design focus effect tocotrienol , utilized statin drug . However , subject recruit cholesterol level 200 mg/dl 240 mg/dl want take drug . This make impossible recruit subject . Therefore , current protocol submit use CRYR China know effect serum lipid use study examine whether tocotrienol suppress increase gene expression 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase ( HMG-CoA ) reductase lower serum lipid compare CRYR alone . This objective achieve recruiting individual cholesterol level within l range 200 240 mg/dl drug treatment optional . After acclimation step 1 American Heart Association ( AHA ) diet , subject randomize one four group receive 1 ) Placebo ; 2 ) CRYR alone ; 3 ) TRF alone ; 4 ) CRYR TRF combination 12 week . Fasting lipid include cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol measure baseline , 6 week 12 week .</detailed_description>
