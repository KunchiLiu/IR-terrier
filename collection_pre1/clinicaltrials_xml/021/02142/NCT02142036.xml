	<brief_summary>The metastatic lesion may different primary tumor intrinsic tumor heterogenity , clonal selection metastatic process follow previous cytotoxic treatment . Metastatic tumor harbor actionable target signal pathway may respond inhibitory agent direct specific aberration irrespective tumor origin . In MetAction study , patient receive therapy base molecular aberration metastatic lesion , actionable target identification ( ATI ) , rather histological tumor type . The ATI rate unselected metastatic patient population uncertain , response rate associate ATI base target therapy hardly report . In perspective , The MetAction study essentially feasibility study aim tailor metastatic cancer therapy base genomic profile .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recognizing rapidly increase number drug target specific molecular aberration cancer , necessary define rational strategy make treatment available Norwegian cancer patients.These target drug extremely costly significant side effect , although presumably less extent many classic cytotoxic drug available . Thus , interest patient question society general , important give right drug right patient presumably right time disease course . Hitherto , drug question give palliative setting , i.e . patient disseminate metastatic disease . The metastatic lesion may different primary tumor , hence , rational analyze tumor treat , metastatic lesion ( ) , presence molecular aberration , rather base treatment decision molecular feature know present particular tumor type primary tumor .</detailed_description>
