	<brief_title>Impact Curriculum Intervention Asthma Knowledge Adolescents Public School Salvador-Bahia-Brazil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma one major cause morbidity mortality due chronic disease worldwide high mortality morbidity adolescent . Interventions direct adolescent systematically develop within school environment perform around world . In spite , study Bruzzese ( 2004 ; 2011 ) already show clinical intervention associate educational activity group compose individual similar lifestyle characteristic able modify behavior individual well reduce emergency room visit hospitalization . Thus , necessary develop study . This study control clinical trial . The intervention curriculum intervention asthma . This intervention consist theoretical - practical weekly workshop target content asthma involve aspect related anatomy physiology respiratory tract , conceptualization asthma , prevention , treatment , maintenance retrieval ; recognition action period exacerbation use action plan . These workshop suitable course plan discipline science , biology , chemistry , physic , history , geography , portuguese mathematics . Those characterized mandatory curriculum component develop student elementary secondary education . In parallel curriculum intervention , investigator identify frequency individual diagnosis/symptoms suggestive asthma apply ISAAC questionnaire verification Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) use portable Vitalograph copd - 6 . This assessment identify student suspect asthma , symptom suggestive asthma asthma diagnose . The curriculum organize educational intervention school staff apply intervention group ( include student 10 19 year previously register . The afternoon shift define intervention group may participate asthmatic non-asthmatic student ) . It noteworthy , subsequently , intervention perform control group ( student participate morning shift may participate asthmatic non-asthmatic student ) . The intervention group receive complementary intervention question direct reinforce attitude period exacerbation use action plan , control group receive intervention study . The study hold College Presidente Emilio Garrastazu Medici ( Currently name College Estadual Stiep Carlos Marighella ) school unit medium-sized offer series second segment Elementary School , Middle School Professional Education . This school chosen system evaluation teach methodology well defined political pedagogical project . The investigator identify frequency individual diagnosis/symptoms suggestive asthma apply ISAAC questionnaire verification Forced Expiratory Volume one second ( FEV1 ) monitor individual duly register allocated age group 10-19 year enrol 5th 8th grade study . A despite data Collection Instrument , use : 1 . Questionnaires ISAAC - International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood ; 2 . Form characterize subject clinical outcome 3 . Structured questionnaire assess knowledge ( two different data collection instrument ) : 1 . Questionnaires ISAAC - International Study Asthma Allergies Childhood : In first phase study , standardize questionnaire develop ISAAC apply . It aim evaluate symptom suggestive asthma .

This questionnaire organize number question cover field build explicit subject research . The area : knowledge pathology , trigger , treatment , management crisis myths/truths researcher analyze performance count overall score domains.The adjustment represent knowledge level respondent . Up 25 % hit - Poor knowledge ; 26 - 50 % correct - satisfactory knowledge ; 51-75 % accuracy - Good knowledge ; 76-100 % correct - excellent knowledge . Knowledge learn relief treatment maintenance carry questionnaire consist 4 situation mimic reality . It try observe therapeutic knowledge individual situation imminent asthma attack , follow option answer : `` never '' , `` rarely '' , `` sometimes '' , `` often '' , '' always '' . The investigator collect data analyzed period October 2011 December 2014 . Tools data collection describe sign Informed Consent Coordinator School approval research Ethics Committee - Universidade Federal da Bahia . This protocol submit approve . The investigator use Statistical Programme Statistic Program Social Sciences ( SPSS ) version 21.0 process data . We analyse data descriptive statistic ( proportion measure central tendency ) , Relative risk ( RR ) , absolute risk ( AR ) , odds ratio ( OR ) logistic regression analysis identify measure association use effect systematic educational intervention independent confound variable . In analyzes consider significance level 5 % . The ethical aspect shall base Resolution 196/96 govern research involve human subject , resolution 466/2012 Code Ethics Professional Nursing . The research respect basic principle bioethics : autonomy , non - maleficence , beneficence , justice , appropriate scientific principle , rely free inform consent research subject / legal representative , establish procedure ensure confidentiality privacy people involve indirectly .
