	<brief_summary>The primary aim prospective observational study investigate whether enhanced diagnostic MRI work-up ( include cardiac MRI , angiography aortic arch brain-supplying artery ) combine in-hospital Holter-ECG 5 day duration lead significant increase relevant pathologic finding respect stroke aetiology compare finding obtain routine diagnostic work-up ( include stroke unit monitoring , 24h-Holter-ECG , echocardiography , Doppler-ultrasound brain-supplying artery ) patient acute ischemic stroke atrial fibrillation accord past medical history baseline ECG . A well understand stroke aetiology may improve secondary stroke prevention long term outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Variations delay diagnostic procedure hospitalization acute ischemic stroke still common , time , stroke aetiology remain cryptogenic 20-25 % stroke unit patient . Recent study show ( ) cardiac MRI able detect cardiac source embolism ( thrombi aortic plaque ) equal sensitivity compare echocardiography , ( b ) prolong ECG monitor several days/weeks/years significantly increase detection rate atrial fibrillation . These development might allow faster effective diagnostic work-up patient acute ischemic stroke compare standard diagnostic procedure include doppler-ultrasound extracranial brain-supplying artery , echocardiography , 24-h-Holter ECG stroke unit monitoring . This prospective observational trial therefore aim assess detection rate pathologic finding relevant stroke aetiology obtain enhance MRI set-up ( include cardiac MRI , MR-angiography brain-supplying artery ) prolong Holter-ECG ( 5 day stroke ) comparison finding obtain routine diagnostic procedure acute stroke . Moreover , cumulate evidence implies acute ischemic stroke lead cardiac damage . Since underlie pathophysiological mechanism still poorly understood , HEBRAS study attempt tackle relationship stroke localization ( e.g . insular involvement ) , observed cardiac damage ( indicated troponin elevation ) activation autonomic nervous system ( indicated impairment heart rate variability elevate urinary norepinephrine level ) , respectively . Finally , clarify prognostic impact stroke-induced autonomic dysfunction , heart rate variability analyse respect functional outcome , mortality , recurrent stroke myocardial injury .</detailed_description>
