	<brief_summary>In type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , immune defense cell body attack destroy insulin-producing beta cell leave affected people lifelong need daily insulin injection . Even insulin injection , blood glucose ( sugar ) control imperfect lead many health complication shorten life span . This pilot clinical trial test safety drug , ustekinumab , 20 adult subject recent-onset T1D . Ustekinumab currently license use psoriasis proven highly effective safe investigator hope see similar effect T1D . This trial also use determine best dosage frequency drug give people T1D help design future study drug 's effectiveness . The investigator hope drug block immune cell soon development diabetes , remain insulin-producing cell may protect , regenerate , thus produce insulin individual may insulin free , require less insulin .</brief_summary>
