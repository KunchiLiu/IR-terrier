	<brief_summary>The purpose first part study dose escalation portion study determine dose BKM120 Abraxane safe give two drug use time patient diagnose solid cancer . A solid cancer cancer involve blood , bone marrow lymph node . Dose escalation determines least toxic effect dose drug combination treatment . Once dose establish , use dose expansion phase study determine effect BKM120 Abraxane woman diagnose recurrent endometrial ovarian cancer . We see whether combination drug improve response survival patient treat two drug regimen . Also try find whether change tumor help u determine patient likely respond BKM120 Abraxane .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I BKM120/Abraxane Solid Tumors , Expansion Phase Recurrent Endometrial Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability BKM120 combination weekly nabpaclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) patient recurrent solid tumor particular recurrent endometrial ovarian cancer . - To determine MTD DLT BKM120 combination weekly nabpaclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) thereby establish recommend phase II dose . Secondary Objectives : - Obtain pilot data clinical tumor response utilize RECIST criterion BKM120 combination weekly nabpaclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) patient history recurrent endometrial recurrent ovarian cancer . - To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) patient treat BKM120 nabpaclitaxel ( Abraxane® ) history recurrent endometrial ovarian cancer . - To explore molecular marker serve potential molecular predictor response include PIK3CA , mTOR , KRAS , PTEN p53 mutation well amplification ErbB2 . - To test predictive value PIK3CA KRAS mutation predict response regimen woman diagnose recurrent endometrial ovarian cancer .</detailed_description>
