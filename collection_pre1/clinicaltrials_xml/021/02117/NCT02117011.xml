	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy ( RT ) often use treat breast cancer . RT combine breast surgery associate well outcomes early stage breast cancer compare surgery alone . Fatigue one important side effect RT decrease patient ' quality life . Studies find physical activity ( PA ) may help improve quality life cancer survivor . PA report low fatigue , anxiety , depression . Physical inactivity long period time may lead rapid energy physical function loss . PA intervention study patient undergo RT include mostly White patient . There evidence African American patient undergo RT . The purpose study examine efficacy structure , moderate-intensity , aerobic exercise program reduce cancer-related fatigue African Americans undergoing RT localize breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>* Purpose project ( one two sentence ) : The objective study examine efficacy structure , moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program reduce cancer-related fatigue African Americans undergoing RT localize breast cancer . 2 . * Study design ( example , hypothesis , research question , standard experimental procedures/drugs/devices equipment , etc . ) : This randomized clinical trial determine efficacy structure , moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program reduce cancer-related fatigue . The study occur single-center setting . There 30 breast cancer patient/subjects , portion ( n=15 ) undergo structure , moderate-intensity aerobic exercise deliver via stationary cycling device ( peddler ) . The study duration would 12 month , administration study would 8 week . The exercise program carry Washington Hospital Center wait radiation therapy treatment . 3 . * Rationale justification study ( i.e . historical background , investigator 's personal experience , pertinent medical literature , etc . ) : Given widespread use RT treatment early stage breast cancer , identification fatigue important side-effect RT , important test intervention reduce fatigue improve health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) among survivor . PA intervention show improve quality life reduce fatigue cancer patient undergo RT . However , study PA RT-related fatigue HRQOL conduct among Whites evidence efficacy PA intervention African Americans lack . Additionally , time introduction PA respect RT timeline also unclear . Finally , although preliminary study suggest fatigue might relate inflammation , clear whether effect PA fatigue associate change inflammatory biomarkers . The purpose study test efficacy structure PA intervention reduce cancer-related fatigue among African American patient undergo RT breast cancer . This study also design provide pilot data ) acceptability , adherence PA intervention African Americans breast cancer , ii ) correlation inflammation marker fatigue PA. 4 . * Primary objective : The purpose study test efficacy structure PA intervention reduce cancer-related fatigue among African American patient undergo RT breast cancer . 5 . * Secondary objective : To determine efficacy structure , moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program improve HRQOL African American patient undergo RT localize breast cancer . To determine acceptability , adherence structure , exercise intervention among African-American patient undergo RT localize breast cancer . 8 . * Treatment Plan : 4.1 Randomization All participant ( N=30 ) schedule radiotherapy randomize one two follow group : ) 8-week structured , moderate-intensity aerobic training exercise regimen concurrent radiation therapy ( N=15 ) , ii ) usual care control group ( N=15 ) . Participants randomize study bio-statistician eligibility determine . All participant study undergo radiation therapy schedule physician . The exercise intervention interfere either dose timeline radiation therapy . 4.2 PA intervention Those participant randomize exercise group require exercise 5 days/week 8 week coincide radiation treatment session . The exercise intervention consist aerobic training . Participants required meet maintain goal 75 min/week aerobic exercise use portable cycle ergometer ; ; 15 min/day 5 days/week . The cycle ergometer consist two cycling pedal mount stationary block allow patient exercise sit . The tension pedal adjust provide desire tension . Patients also move equipment use conveniently sit anywhere chair . 9 . * Primary Study Endpoint : The primary endpoint study fatigue , HRQOL , biomarkers inflammation .</detailed_description>
