	<brief_summary>The goal study determine safe dose GR-MD-02 use combination FDA-approved dose ipilimumab ( 3 mg/kg ) patient advanced melanoma . GR-MD-02 galectin . Galectins family proteins numerous function normal mammalian biology include facilitation cell-cell interaction , regulation cell-death regulation immune system response . The hypothesis safe dose GR-MD-02 give FDA-approved dose ipilimumab find .</brief_summary>
