	<detailed_description>As many one three old adult may experience insomnia . Older adult frequent user hypnotic medication . Although safer , use even late `` sleep pill '' lead cognitive impairment risk fall . Thus , surprising non-pharmacological treatment insomnia pursue alternative medication , suggest `` first line therapy '' . We propose randomized clinical trial evaluate relative efficacy effectiveness specific component cognitive behavioral therapy insomnia ( CBT-I ) : sleep restriction ( SR ) cognitive therapy ( CT ) comparison combine SR CT ( SR+CT ) . We hypothesize propose mechanism action CT versus SR substantially differ , combination may additive effect . Even though mechanisms action SR CT may differ , data exists document addition one provide overall clinical benefit either intervention alone . Finally , good understand `` '' `` '' SR CT work , plan formally evaluate select mediator moderator clinical effect include physiological measure anxiety arousal . Three treatment ( SR , CT , SR+CT ) compare randomized clinical trial parallel group design . Efficacy effectiveness data collect prior beginning treatment , 6 week treatment , end 6-month follow-up . These effort follow National Institute Mental Health Strategic Plan Strategy 3.1 develop innovative intervention design intervention study , case , promote new intervention trial focus mediator moderator treatment response .</detailed_description>
