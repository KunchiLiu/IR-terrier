	<brief_summary>This study design apply functional imaging , Fluorodeoxyglucose_Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography ( V/Q SPECT ) , treatment treatment see predict well treatment work cancer well lungs function treatment . A Computerized Tomography ( CT ) also perform along procedure help researcher see clearly cancer healthy lung locate . The researcher also perform blood test study look marker blood see help determine risk develop side effect radiation lung . The researcher hope study help future design radiation treatment plan provide best treatment individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death United States . Although surgery provide best chance cure , majority lung cancer require radiation treatment . The current radiation recommendation , use modern technique uniform dose prescription , generate overall cure rate less 10-15 % , moderate toxicity 10-30 % treated patient . Who cure develop side effect ? Computed tomography ( CT ) useful monitoring tool , limited power predict tumor control lung toxicity . Using [ 18F ] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) ventilation/perfusion single photon emission compute tomography ( V/Q SPECT ) , recently show heterogeneous change tumor activity regional lung function course radiation , may associate long-term outcome . Data also show radiation up-regulates expression cytokine , transform growth factor beta 1 ( TGFÃŸ1 ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . We hypothesize radiation-induced functional change plasma cytokine associate long-term tumor control radiation lung damage . The general strategy protocol perform functional imaging blood test course radiation correlate result long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
