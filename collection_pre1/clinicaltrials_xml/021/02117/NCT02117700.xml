	<brief_summary>Although weight reduction physical activity-based intervention mainstay therapy nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , maintenance difficult typically unsuccessful . This affirm extreme need alternate and/or adjunct therapy . Although convince data animal study adult human study benefit natural product , N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) , variety liver condition include NAFLD emerge , study child scarce . Therefore , aim study test use NAC innovative approach attenuate progression NAFD obese child biopsy proven NASH . The central hypothesis NAC supplementation reduce liver fat liver enzymes ameliorate risk factor cardiometabolic disease child NAFLD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Physical activity ( PA ) -induced weight reduction , suggest therapy noalcoholic liver disease ( NAFLD ) , difficult maintenance typically unsuccessful child , affirm acute need alternative/adjunct therapy . Although promising approach report , benefit incongruent mostly marginal . N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) , derivative natural amino acid , cysteine , appear promise adjunct therapy PA . Animal adult human study suggest NAC-induced attenuation liver abnormality , oxidative stress , insulin resistance inflammation . The primary aim proposal determine obese child biopsy proven NASH elevate liver enzymes effect NAC two different dos liver fat use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , liver enzymes risk factor cardiometabolic disease . We hypothesize NAC produce beneficial effect parameter .</detailed_description>
