	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize treatment obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) positively affect appearance patient . The purpose study compare effect one month treatment CPAP placebo appearance patient OSA randomize crossover study . Consecutive sleepy patient severe OSA include . The patient underwent three polysomnograms ( PSG ) : first one confirm OSA two additional one use placebo ( nasal dilator ) CPAP titration start treatment period . All patient randomly include two treatment group : 1 ) placebo use 2 ) CPAP use . After one month first treatment 15 day washout , patient crossed-over second treatment . Photographs patient ' face obtain three experimental moment . The photograph present random order Qualtrics Survey Software , evaluate online 704 observer quantify healthy appearance ( unhealthy extremely healthy ) , attractive ( unattractive extremely attractive ) tire ( tired extremely tire ) . Apparent age also rat observer . Quantitative evaluation skin characteristic patient ' face also carry experimental moment , include presence acne , patch , porosity , wrinkle , texture , skin tone uniformity , capture image VISIATM System equipment . During treatment period , 30 patient ( age = 46±9 year , 21 men ) wear placebo intervention 98 % night adherence CPAP 94 % , mean 6.0 ± 1.7 hour use per day treatment . Observational assessment photograph show patient evaluate young use CPAP ( P &lt; 0.001 ) , quantitative change face skin characteristic observe compare baseline use placebo . Sleepy patient severe OSA young appearance one month CPAP treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Appearance Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : A previous study show sleep deprived people perceive less healthy , less attractive , tired normal night 's sleep ( Axelsson et al. , Beauty sleep : experimental study perceive health attractiveness sleep deprive people . BMJ 2010 ; 341 : c6614 ) . The investigator believe likewise sleep deprivation , patient OSA also perceive less attractive , tired , healthy look old age . investigator therefore hypothesize treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) positively affect appearance patient . The purpose study compare effect one month treatment CPAP placebo appearance patient OSA randomize crossover study . Methods : The investigator include 30 consecutive patient gender , age 30 60 year , refer sleep clinic Heart Institute ( InCor ) University Sao Paulo , history snoring , excessive sleepiness , severe OSA confirm polysomnography . Patients exclude present previous treatment sleep-disordered breathing , previous diagnosis chronic disease interfere sleep pattern history chronic use alcohol , sedatives drug abuse , last month . Patients randomize two treatment group : 1 ) Placebo arm - use nasal dilator strip ; 2 ) CPAP arm - use CPAP . At first night treatment patient submit polysomnography nasal strip ( placebo arm ) CPAP titration ( CPAP arm ) . After one month treatment first randomize arm , patient submit two week without treatment ( washout period ) . After washout period , patient assign treatment crossover , i.e. , patient group 1 ) receive CPAP therapy patient Group 2 ) receive placebo treatment , period one additional month . Excessive sleepiness ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) quality life ( Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire - FOSQ ) evaluate three experimental time : baseline ( immediately treatment ) , one month ( one month treatment define baseline ) , 2 month ( one month treatment crossover ) . During study period , patient follow trained professional receive necessary information use treatment . After three day treatment , patient contact phone ensure adherence treatment solve potential doubt . After week treatment , patient return sleep clinic management adherence data memory card ( CPAP group ) data full fill sleep log ( Placebo group ) , also reinforce information study protocol . Any issue concern treatment also solve phone call . All patient photograph three experimental time : baseline ( immediately treatment ) , one month ( one month treatment define baseline ) 2 month ( one month treatment crossover ) . Photographs take train photographer standardized manner . The photographer blind experimental condition patient . The photograph display randomize order 704 observer ( general population , gender , similar socioeconomic status education ) , unaware condition study . The observer rat face attractiveness ( unattractive attractive ) , health ( sick healthy ) , tiredness ( tire tire ) . Perceived age also rat observer ' evaluation Qualtrics Survey Software . The high-resolution analyze system VISIA TM ( Canfield Scientific Inc. Fairfield USA ) use computer analysis precisely measure presence porphyrin ( P. acne ) , coloration/evenness , vascular feature , porosity , wrinkle skin texture patient 's face . The photograph VISIA TM take standard skin preparation analyze specific analysis algorithm . Collection dermatological assessment conduct three experimental sample time . During treatment period , patient wear placebo intervention 98 % night adherence CPAP 94 % , mean 6.0 ± 1.7 hour use per day treatment . After CPAP treatment , compare baseline placebo treatment , improvement objective sleep quality , sleepiness , quality life depressive symptom observe ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . Observational assessment photograph show patient evaluate young use CPAP ( P &lt; 0.001 ) , quantitative change face skin characteristic observe compare baseline use placebo . Linear regression analysis identify number day CPAP treatment , total sleep time percentage total sleep time oxyhemoglobin saturation 90 % predictor decrease rat age CPAP treatment . In conclusion , sleepy patient severe OSA young appearance one month CPAP treatment .</detailed_description>
