	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy become `` gold standard '' detection colonic polyp colon cancer . However , colonoscopy cause significant abdominal discomfort abdominal pain procedure , require intravenous sedation use analgesic . The discomfort pain mostly cause air insufflation intubation difficulty advancement colonoscope order reach cecum . Study Hypothesis : Use `` Visualization '' Balloon facilitate advancement colonoscope eliminate need colonic distention air CO2 , shorten length procedure , reduce patient 's discomfort decrease amount sedative analgesic use colonoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Safety Colonoscopy With `` Visualization '' Balloon</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate effectiveness safety `` Visualization '' Balloon performance colonoscopy . Our hypothesis , use `` Visualization '' Balloon decrease colonic distention , patient 's discomfort , use sedative analgetics procedure simplify performance colonoscopy result shorten procedure time increase rate cecal intubation . Specific aim study : 1 . To compare procedure time effectiveness `` Visualization '' Balloon colonoscopy traditional CO2-insufflation colonoscopy . 2 . To compare safety profile traditional CO2-insufflation colonoscopy colonoscopy use `` Visualization '' Balloon . 4 STUDY ENDPOINTS 4.1 Primary Outcome To compare mean cecal intubation time achieve `` Visualization '' Balloon colonoscopy , mean cecal intubation time achieve standard colonoscopy use CO2 insufflation . 4.2 Secondary Outcomes To compare `` Visualization '' Balloon colonoscopy standard CO2-insufflation colonoscopy regard : 1 . Total amount carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) gas colonic insufflation use procedure . 2 . Ease colonoscope insertion . 3 . The length colonoscope reach cecum . 4 Colonoscope withdrawal time total procedure time . 5 . Cecal intubation rate . 6 . Total dosage analgesic sedative procedure . 7 . Patient satisfaction : perceive pain discomfort immediately procedure 24 hour post procedure . 8 . Complications colonoscopy . 9 . Polyp detection rate .</detailed_description>
