	<brief_summary>In study investigator evaluate uptake 89Zirconium labeled cetuximab extra-hepatic colorectal metastasis . The investigator hypothesize uptake 89Zr-cetuximab require response cetuximab . If uptake present investigator escalate dose cetuximab repeat 89Zr-cetuximab PET . The investigator evaluate clinical benefit rate cetuximab patient without uptake . The ultimate goal create selection tool predict response cetuximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Image Guided Treatment Optimization With Cetuximab Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Currently , third line systemic treatment patient advance , wild type K-RAS recently demonstrate wild type N-RAS ( thereafter refer wild type RAS ) colorectal cancer ( CRC ) include epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibition anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab . This type treatment modest significant beneficial activity patient group improve progression-free overall survival . Although known patient advance wild type RAS CRC respond anti-EGFR treatment , understood patient wild type RAS CRC benefit type therapy . Apart potential gene mutation involve response treatment , difference variability pharmacokinetics may play crucial role response anti-EGFR treatment . In non-responders insufficient drug accumulation may occur tumor due pharmacokinetic process , cetuximab sequestration liver express high level EGFR , due low level EGFR expression tumor lesion . Our main hypothesis uptake cetuximab metastasis require response achieve cetuximab uptake increase dose result improve clinical benefit patient advance CRC wild type RAS . Objectives : PART I : 1. demonstrate 89Zr-cetuximab uptake non-hepatic metastasis standard dose cohort wise increase cetuximab dos ( dose escalation ) . 2. determine association 89Zr-cetuximab uptake non-hepatic metastasis treatment response . PART II To determine response rate optimize dose cetuximab select part 1 patient without 89Zr-cetuximab tumor uptake standard dose cetuximab ( dose extension ) . Study design : This multicentre non-randomized intervention study ; phase I-II dose escalation/extension study . Study population : Patients histopathologically confirm advanced CRC wild type RAS , without local treatment option , age ≥ 18 year , life expectancy least 12 week , candidate anti-EGFR antibody monotherapy ( 3rd line palliative treatment ) . Intervention : In first part perform exploratory PET study patient metastasize , RAS wild type CRC without local treatment option , treat cetuximab . We hypothesize uptake 89Zr-cetuximab metastasis require response cetuximab . We analyze target 89Zr-cetuximab metastasis association 89Zr-cetuximab tumor uptake tumor response . Early response evaluation do 18F-FDG PET . In subgroup 20 patient metastasis within field view ( 18 cm ) include heart , tumor perfusion measure 15O-water PET scan . In addition , investigate hypothesis increase cetuximab dose result uptake patient without uptake metastasis 89Zr-cetuximab cetuximab give standard dose regimen . In second part study whether dose adjustment base 89Zr-cetuximab target result improve response clinical benefit rate . In addition , EGFR expression saturation cetuximab study tumor biopsy obtain treatment . Molecular pathway activate EGFR kinase activity well phosphoproteomics study tumor biopsy skin biopsy start treatment . In addition , relation microRNA ( miRNA ) peptide profile relation response therapy study .</detailed_description>
