	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate relative contribution fast plasma glucose postprandial glucose various HbA1c level use 6-day CGM . Evaluation relationship HbA1c , CGM , serum fructosamine eAG , also look . HYPOTHESES : 1 . Fasting hyperglycaemia main contributor Malaysian T2DM patient poor glycaemic control ( high HbA1c ) , postprandial hyperglycaemia play important role lower HbA1c level . 2 . There good correlation HbA1c , CGM , serum fructosamine eAG Malaysian patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) form via non-enzymatic glycation pathway exposure haemoglobin plasma glucose . The HbA1c assay widely use assess glycaemic control diabetes mellitus ( DM ) 60 90 day period show correlate development complication Type 1 ( T1DM ) Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . ( A ) HbA1c , Fasting Plasma Glucose Post-prandial Glucose Several study look relationship fast glucose , post-prandial glucose HbA1c , yield conflict result . In 2001 , one study examine relationship plasma glucose HbA1c 371 T2DM patient lifestyle modification oral antidiabetic drug ( OADs ) . These patient perform self monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) 5 6 time per day ( fast , pre-meal 2 hour post-prandial ) . In study HbA1c good correlation pre-prandial glucose rather postprandial hyperglycaemia . A landmark study carry 2003 use one-day , 4-point , SMBG profile 290 T2DM patient oral anti-diabetic drug ( OAD ) insulin . This study suggest patient HbA1c &lt; 8.5 % , post-prandial hyperglycaemia main contributor excessive glucose level . Conversely , patient HbA1c level ≥ 8.5 % , fast hyperglycaemia predominate . This pattern propose reflect natural progression T2DM , post-prandial hyperglycaemia occur early course T2DM fast hyperglycaemia gradually predominate progressive β-cell failure . This concept challenge later , 7-point SMBG profile baseline 24 week performed 1699 patient T2DM ( OAD insulin therapy ) HbA1c ˃ 7 % . It find fast hyperglycaemia main contributor overall hyperglycaemia ( 76-80 % ) low high HbA1c level . Another similar study carry Taiwan 2010 ( Asian descent ) , several key difference . This important Asian T2DM patient show predominantly insulin secretory defect oppose insulin resistance typifies T2DM Caucasians . Different ethnic population also show glycate haemoglobin different rate . HbA1c consistently high African Americans compare non-Hispanic White , matter normal glucose tolerance ( 0.13-0.21 % ) , pre-diabetes ( 0.26-0.30 % ) diabetes ( 0.47 % ) . Another key difference taiwanese study use continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) 3 day period 121 T2DM patient treat OAD , provide far great number measure glucose value compare SMBG . It find post-prandial hyperglycaemia contribute significantly ( 80 % ) overall hyperglycaemia HbA1c &lt; 7 % . At level HbA1c &gt; 7 % , study report fasting post-prandial glucose level make equal contribution overall glycaemic status . ( B ) HbA1c , serum fructosamine estimate average glucose ( eAG ) Although HbA1c regard gold standard assessment overall glycaemic status diabetes mellitus , several limitation use . Factors affect erythrocyte turnover , haemoglobinopathy ( prevalent Asians ) , chronic renal failure , recent blood transfusion erythropoietin therapy may render HbA1c unsuitable assess glycaemic status . In instance , method assess glycaemic control may use . Fructosamine form plasma glucose reacts protein . Serum fructosamine level use indicate average glucose level 2 3 week period . The correlation serum fructosamine HbA1c level describe Caucasians Asian population12 . It report discordance HbA1c fructosamine , especially presence nephropathy . SMBG CGM alternative HbA1c assess chronic glycaemia . The A1c-derived Average Glucose ( ADAG ) study look 700 individual ( 300 T1DM , 300 T2DM 100 healthy individual ) . HbA1c , 8-point SMBG 48-hour CGM assess monthly 4 month period . Glucose level accrue SMBG CGM use calculate estimate average glucose level ( eAG ) .The ADAG study identify linear relationship HbA1c eAG precede 8-12 week T1DM T2DM patient normal erythrocyte lifespan . One limitation ADAG study under-representation Asians subject . By perform study , aim evaluate glycaemic profile T2DM patient wide spectrum HbA1c , use 6 day CGM , Asian perspective . We also hope establish positive correlation among HbA1c , serum fructosamine , estimate average glucose CGM group population .</detailed_description>
