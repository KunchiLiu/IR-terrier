	<detailed_description>This Phase I-II , open-label study . Each patient receive target dose EPO deliver via TARGTEPO . The targeted dos determine accord 3 cohort follow : Group A ( 18-25 IU/Kg/day ) , Group B ( 35-45 IU/Kg/day ) , Group C ( 55-65 IU/Kg/day ) . The objective evaluate safety biologic activity TARGTEPO treatment maintain Hb level within target range 9-12 g/dl . Biological activity assessment include duration TARGTEPO secretion measure serum EPO level baseline</detailed_description>
