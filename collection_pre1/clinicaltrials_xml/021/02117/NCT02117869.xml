	<brief_summary>Grapefruit ( GF ) contain furanocoumarin ( FC ) know irreversibly inhibit activity cytochrome P450-3A ( CYP3A ) enzymes human gastrointestinal tract ( PAINE 2005 ) . Because CYP3A enzymes integral metabolism drug , co-ingesting GF GF Juice ( GFJ ) , inhibit CYP3A , along drug reliant CYP3A metabolism significantly alter drug kinetic property result elevate plasma drug concentration may toxic . The Citrus Research Education Center University Florida develop new GF hybrid ( GFH ) contain low FC content may inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity , therefore may safe co-ingest drug require CYP3A activity metabolism . The investigator hypothesize low FC GFHJ inhibit CYP3A degree regular GFJ , significantly affect midazolam kinetics compare regular GFJ . Midazolam FDA approve probe drug CYP3A activity use previously establish interaction GFJ midazolam . This study evaluate concomitant administration midazolam low FC GFHJ , regular GFJ , water evaluate significance interaction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As participant study follow take place : A pre-study visit do include physical exam , pregnancy test applicable , review medical history . If qualify undergo three separate study visit describe . While participate study , participant eat grapefruit citrus fruit ( orange , lemon , example ) drink non-study specific grapefruit juice citrus fruit juice , citrus contain food ( orange marmalade , example ) 1 week prior study visit . In addition , herbal dietary supplement counter medication take 48 hour study visit . During three study visit , separate least 2 week , one two different grapefruit juice product ( either low furanocoumarin grapefruit hybrid regular grapefruit ) water provide . The order three drink receive random , like toss coin . Also , 1 dose midazolam ( drug normally use make someone sleepy relax medical test ) give visit .
