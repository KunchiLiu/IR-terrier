	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically flow cytometry confirm diagnosis Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( BCLL/SLL ) accord IWCLL 2008 criterion . The malignant B cell must coexpress CD5 CD19 CD20 . Patients lack CD23 expression leukemia cell examine ( found NOT ) either ( 11 ; 14 ) cyclin D1 overexpression , rule mantle cell lymphoma . 2 . Active disease meeting least 1 follow IWCLL 2008 criterion require treatment : A minimum one follow constitutional symptom : Unintentional weight loss &gt; 10 % within previous 6 month prior screen Extreme fatigue ( unable work perform usual activity ) Fevers great 100.5ᵒF ≥2 week without evidence infection Night sweat without evidence infection . Evidence progressive marrow failure manifest development , worsen anemia thrombocytopenia Massive ( i.e. , &gt; 6 cm leave costal margin ) , progressive symptomatic splenomegaly Massive nod cluster ( i.e. , &gt; 10 cm long diameter ) progressive lymphadenopathy Progressive lymphocytosis increase &gt; 50 % 2month period , anticipate double time le 6 month Autoimmune anemia thrombocytopenia poorly responsive corticosteroid 3 . Patients relapsed/refractory CLL define receive ≥2 treatment regimen include : A treatment regimen contain cytotoxic agent ( eg , fludarabine , pentostatin , cladribine , cyclophosphamide , chlorambucil , bendamustine ) AND A treatment regimen contain therapeutic antiCD20 antibody ( e.g. , rituximab , ofatumumab , obinutuzumab ) AND A treatment regimen contain ibrutinib unless patient candidate All treatment regimens must administer ≥2 cycle unless patient immediately allergic intolerant regimen A disease expert study site must detail discussion patient treatment option either approve FDA part relevant standard care patient BCLL/SLL multiply relapse set 4 . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 5 . Patients ≥18 year old 6 . Patients must organ function define : Direct bilirubin ≤2 X institutional ULN ( unless due know Gilbert 's syndrome compensate hemolysis directly attributable CLL ) AST ALT less equal 2.5 X institutional ULN Creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR estimate creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min calculate use CockcroftGault equation Total white blood cell count ≤200,000/mm3 Platelets ≥10,000/mm3 active bleeding 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document 8 . Ability swallow retain oral medication 9 . Patients receive chronic acute warfarin treatment exclude , monitor closely consider switch therapy . P1446A05 highly protein bound competitive inhibitor CYP2C9 high concentration thus may potentiate action warfarin patient 10 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin urine pregnancy test screen 11 . All patient reproductive potential ( heterosexually active men woman ) must agree use barrier method contraception second method contraception men must agree donate sperm study least 4 week receive last dose study treatment 1 . Recent therapeutic intervention include ) prior nitrosoureas mitomycin C ; prior radio toxinimmunoconjugates within 6 week ; b ) therapeutic anticancer antibody ( include rituximab , ofatumumab obinituzumab ) within 4 week ; c ) chemotherapy radiation therapy within 2 week prior initiation study drug 2 . The patient recover adverse event related prior therapy Grade ≤1 ( exclude Grade 2 alopecia neuropathy ) 3 . Chronic use corticosteroid excess prednisone 20 mg/day equivalent 4 . Patients past enrolled study Cdk inhibitor 5 . History prior malignancy except : ) Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present ≥2 year prior initiation current study ; b ) adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease ; c ) adequately treat situ carcinoma ( e.g. , cervical , esophageal , breast , etc . ) without evidence disease ; ) asymptomatic prostate cancer manage `` watch wait '' strategy ; e ) myelodysplastic syndrome clinically well control evidence cytogenetic abnormality characteristic myelodysplasia bone marrow screen 6 . Patients uncontrolled immune hemolysis thrombocytopenia ( positive direct antiglobulin test absence hemolysis exclusion ) 7 . Patients know Richter 's transformation progressive deem require immediate chemotherapy ( history Richter 's transformation exclusion ) ; patient prolymphocytic leukemia ( prolymphocytes blood &gt; 55 % ) 8 . Patients clinically significant medical condition malabsorption , inflammatory bowel disease , chronic condition manifest diarrhea , refractory nausea , vomit condition interfere significantly absorption study drug 9 . Patients mean QTc interval &gt; 450 msec screen patient take drug know prolong QTc interval ( see Section 9 , Appendix D ) switch alternative drug 10 . Nursing woman 11 . Known history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) active Hepatitis B C. Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) cause false positive hepatitis B serology . If patient receive routine IVIG core antibody surface antigen positivity without evidence active viremia ( negative hepatitis B DNA ) may still participate study , hepatitis serology Hepatitis B DNA monitor periodically treat physician . 12 . Any condition participation study judge Investigator detrimental patient intercurrent illness include , limit uncontrolled active infection ; unstable angina pectoris ; uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ; transient ischemic attack pulmonary embolism previous 1 month psychiatric/social situation would jeopardize compliance study requirement .</criteria>
