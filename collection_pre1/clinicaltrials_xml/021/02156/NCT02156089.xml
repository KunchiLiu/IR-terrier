	<brief_summary>Background : - People attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) often problem motivation reward . . Omega-3 fat help symptom ADHD improve child . Researchers want learn brain activity people ADHD see take omega-3 fat might help . Objective : - To learn omega-3 fat affect brain activity ADHD symptom . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 55 ADHD symptom . Design : - Participants screen medical history review medical record . - For study visit 1 , participant medical examination interview confirm ADHD . They IQ test give blood urine sample . Height , weight , blood pressure measure . They also need sign consent agree take part study . They ask complete food diary 4 day - For visit 2 , participant give blood sample . They complete questionnaire mood ADHD symptoms.. They may give blood saliva sample genetic testing . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They lie table slide metal cylinder . It make loud noise ; participant get earplugs . This scan examines structure brain . - Participants functional MRI scan . This scan measure function brain volunteer perform task scanner . They stop ADHD medication 48 hour scan . - Participants receive key-lime flavored omega-3 smoothie mix placebo takeevery day - For visit 3 , participant give blood sample complete questionnaire . - For visit 4 , participant weigh blood test MRI scan per . They repeat questionnaire guess whether receive omega-3 placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) addictive behavior persistently relate impaired reward-related process ventral striatum evidence functional magnetic resonance imaging study ( fMRI ) . These impairment characterize decreased BOLD activation think link dopamine pathway include decreased D2 receptor function . Omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acid ( HUFAs ) critical cell-signaling among complex function throughout central nervous system . Animal model demonstrate deprive animal omega-3 DHA utero significantly decrease density ventral striatal D2- like receptor furthermore depletes dopamine nucleus acumen 40-60 % . The behavioral profile animal subject dietary induced deficiency omega-3 reflect decrease goal-directed behavior increase goal-irrelevant activity , hyperactivity , increase anxiety reduce behavior flexibility . Abnormally low level omega-3 HUFAs persistently report erythrocyte child adult ADHD supplementation omega-3 HUFAs find meta-analysis 10 clinical trial improve symptom ADHD . However , date one test potential mediating effect omega-3 supplementation reward-related process adult ADHD use neuroimaging technique . There hence need research potential treatment effect omega-3 assessment brain function . Therefore , primary objective study test effect omega-3 intervention ( compare placebo ) increase ventral striatal activation monetary incentive delay ( MID ) task . Secondary objective include collect neuroimaging data standardize questionnaire measure , mood , quality life symptom ADHD . Study Population : 150 adult , other-wise healthy , age 18-55 ADHD . Design : The active group stratify accord age sex either active intervention group receive ( 1 ) 3000 mg omega-3 HUFA smoothie placebo group ( 2 ) 3000 mg smoothie macadamia nut oil 16 week . After enrollment baseline testing , active participant randomize either treatment placebo group instruct begin consumption assign emulsion . Randomized participant assessed baseline , 1 month , 8 week , 16 week . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome assessment measure ventral-striatum activation MID task . Secondary objective include : structural MRI , symptom ADHD use Conner Adult ADHD Rating Scales ; negative affective symptom ; endocannabinoid level weight change .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any medical illness treatment view investigator would compromise participation research participant safety , determine medical history , physical examination , laboratory test ( see detail Screening measure ) , include , limited : Unstable medical condition require immediate intervention . Unstable rapidly progressive neurological disease . History hemorrhagic ischemic stroke within last 3 month . Known heart disease . Hypertension . Asthma If participant relate study investigator superior , subordinate , immediate family member . HIV positive . Significant dietary limitation : Allergy , hypersensitivity , intolerance fish oil omega3 fat find fish.. Allergy , hypersensitivity , intolerance Macadamia nut nuts almond , walnut , pecan , peanut , etc . Pregnancy breastfeeding ( urine pregnancy test ; selfreport ) . Reported consumption fish seafood three time per week within last three month . Regular consumption omega3 supplement ( e.g. , cod liver oil , borage oil , fish oil even primrose oil ) , define average 250 mg/day omega3 HUFAs previous 3 month . Severe alcohol substance use disorder accord AUDIT . Acute intoxication withdrawal alcohol CNS active substance extent may impair capacity provide informed consent participate research . Some neuropsychiatric disorder either rare associate profound alteration brain structure function exclude . This include diagnosis severe Bipolar disorder Axis 1 psychotic disorder assess SCID , include schizophrenia , psychosis NOS , autism , substance dependence ; dementia , eat disorder . Cognitive impairment severe enough preclude informed consent valid response selfreport questionnaire . Behavioral instability significant enough impair ability consent participation . Participation research study opinion investigator would interfere study outcome study compliance . On follow medication : Atomoxetine ( Strattera ) , bupropion ( Wellbutrin ) , tricyclic antidepressant ( imipramine ) , alpha adrenergic agonist ( clonidine , guanfacine ) modafinil ( Provigil ) depend whether dose interferes scan whether patient stay dose throughout study . Use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , dalteparin , dipyrdamole , enoxaparin , ticlopedine , per week within last three month . Living situation unsuitable storage use intervention material . MRI Have ferromagnetic object body , might adversely affect MRI ( e.g. , surgical clip , metal fragment near brain , eye blood vessel , cardiac neurological pacemaker , cochlear eye implant ) . Any doubt presence object result exclusion study . Extreme claustrophobia . Lefthanded individual .</criteria>
