	<brief_summary>Total knee replacement one successful surgical procedure Orthopaedics . However , 10-20 % patient still dissatisfy result surgery . In general , evaluation postoperative functional outcome usually measure self-report questionnaire , Western Ontario Mcmaster Universities osteoarthritic Index ( WOMAC ) Short Form-36 health survey ( SF-36 ) . Another method evaluate functional outcome patient use performance-based test two-minute walk test , still little information regard use evaluate functional recovery patient receive total knee arthroplasty . The objective study : 1 ) ass relationship self-report questionnaire performance-based test among patient schedule TKA ; 2 ) identify clinical variable associate pre- postoperative functional performance patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee one prevalent age-related musculoskeletal condition , result significant impairment patient ' ability perform activity adversely impact quality life . The level impairment patient knee OA measure use validate self-report questionnaire , disease-specific Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) generic Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) . Self-report questionnaire recommend investigator high internal consistency ease administration . Another method evaluate physical function patient knee OA use performance-based test . These test tool assess patient ' ability execute task standardize environment , include 2-minute walk test ( 2MWT ) time get-up-and-go test ( TUG ) . Among self-reported questionnaire knee OA , WOMAC one commonly use baseline assessment measurement treatment outcome , validate patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Although WOMAC provide information individual perceive physical function environment , describe ability perform specific task action . In addition , investigator show score self-report questionnaire arthroplasty overestimate patient ' actual functional capacity . For example , Parent et al demonstrate total knee arthroplasty patient dramatic improvement 2 month assess WOMAC function subscale , however significant change measure performance-based test assess gait speed stair ascent duration . Therefore , clinician cautious interpret finding study provide self-report questionnaire score . Given self-report questionnaire may over-estimate functional status joint replacement , author advocate performance-based test measure outcome , recommend use preoperative period baseline measurement follow subsequent comparison postoperative measurement . The objective study : 1 ) ass relationship self-reported questionnaire ( WOMAC SF-36 ) performance-based test ( 2MWT , TUG ) among patient schedule TKA ; 2 ) identify clinical variable associate pre- post-operative performance 2MWT TUG . Our hypothesis correlation self-report questionnaire performance-based test would low moderate , thus two type measurement evaluate distinct domain functional status patient undergo TKA .</detailed_description>
