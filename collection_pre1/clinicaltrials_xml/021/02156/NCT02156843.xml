	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center Phase 3 study evaluate safety efficacy Pyridorin 300 mg BID ( twice daily , every 12 hour ) subject nephropathy due type 2 diabetes mellitus . In study , nephropathy define Serum Creatinine ( SCr ) &gt; = 1.3 ( ≥1.25 ) mg/dL ( 111 umol/L ) female &gt; =1.5 ( ≥1.45 ) mg/dL ( 128 umol/L ) male subject 24-hour urine collection protein/creatinine ration ( PCR ) &gt; =1200 mg/g ( 136 mg/mmol ) , applicable PS Phase , Visit 1S 1.1S 24-urine collection PCR ≥600 mg/g ( 68 mg/mmol ) . Subjects must baseline SCr &lt; 3.0 mg/dL ( 265 umol/L ) must previously establish standard care screening .</detailed_description>
