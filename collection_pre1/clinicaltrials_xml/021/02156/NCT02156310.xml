	<detailed_description>Background : High blood pressure common complication observe cancer patient prescribed class medication know anti-VEGF drug . Increased blood pressure , also know hypertension , increase risk heart attack stroke , thus adversely affect survival quality life patient group . However , little know mechanism lead high blood pressure anti-VEGF drug . As result , management anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension largely empirical , hence sub-optimal . A good knowledge effect specific blood pressure lower drug , i.e . antihypertensive , anti-VEGF drug-induced hypertension would optimize therapeutic management reduce risk associate hypertension proteinuria patient cancer . Methods : The investigator access datasets two GSK clinical trial use anti-VEGF drug pazopanib , i.e . VEG108844 VEG105192 , order 1 ) determine way blood pressure change time commence anti-VEGF treatment ; 2 ) identify whether relationship pre-study baseline blood pressure value , treatment specific antihypertensive drug , change blood pressure commence anti-VEGF treatment ; 3 ) identify whether specific antihypertensive drug drug combination , prescribe either commence anti-VEGF treatment , lead good blood pressure control prevent proteinuria anti-VEGF treatment . Specific statistical analysis conduct assess identify association account patient 's characteristic repeat observation time . The investigator plan conduct study 6 month . Studies VEG108844 VEG105192 select investigate anti-VEGF drug , pazopanib , homogeneous group , i.e . patient renal cancer . At time , inclusion placebo arm well treatment arm different anti-VEGF drug , sunitimib , allow initial comparison across different group . The result derive study provide important knowledge 1 ) pattern blood pressure change anti-VEGF drug 2 ) whether specific antihypertensive drug drug class might good others prevent manage anti-VEGF induced hypertension proteinuria . This research pave way clinical study aim test hypothesis generate . The evidence generate could contribute development national international guideline management anti-VEGF induced hypertension . The investigator plan disseminate finding national international oncology and/or hypertension conference publish result peer-reviewed scientific journal . Study Design The selected study , VEG105192 VEG108844 , design investigate efficacy anti-VEGF drug pazopanib vs. placebo ( randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , VEG105192 ) vs. another anti-VEGF drug ( sunitimib , randomise , open-label , parallel group study , VEG108844 ) two renal cancer patient population . Both study provide data repeat blood pressure measurement ( systolic , diastolic pulse pressure ) , medication ( include anti-hypertensive medication ) dose change well number clinical , demographic biochemical characteristic . This information essential conduct analysis association variable . Studies Selected Study Populations The study VEG105192 VEG108844 select compare choose VEGF-inhibitor ( pazopanib ) vs. either placebo another VEGF-inhibitor ( sunimitib ) similar study group , i.e . patient renal cancer . Moreover , study provide repeat measure blood pressure data medication dose change . Considering study allow : 1 ) characterise blood pressure temporal change patient receive different anti-VEGF drug vs. placebo ; 2 ) assess whether blood pressure lower effect antihypertensive drug similar patient receive pazopanib vs. sunitimib . Primary Secondary Endpoints Study There four primary aim : 1 . To assess anti-hypertensive drug class effective treatment hypertension induce anti-VEGF drug ( pazopanib sunitinib ) . As mechanism seem primarily nitric oxide ( NO ) mediate , possible additional involvement renin-angiotensin system , investigator hypothesise drug salutary effect endothelial function ( angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor [ ACEI ] , angiotensin II receptor blocker [ ARB ] calcium channel blocker [ CCB ] base treatment regimen ) likely effective traditional thiazide diuretic , beta-blockers vasodilator 2 . To assess whether use specific anti-hypertensive drug prior start anti-VEGF drug may reduce risk anti-VEGF drug mediate hypertension . As mechanism seem primarily NO-mediated , possible additional involvement renin-angiotensin system , investigator hypothesise drug salutary effect endothelial function ( ACEI , ARB CCB-based treatment regimen ) may preventative effect VEGF inhibitor mediate hypertension . 3 . To assess whether use ACEI ARB drug prior start anti-VEGF drug may reduce risk anti-VEGF drug mediate proteinuria . As ACEI ARB drug widely demonstrate prevent reduce proteinuria , investigator hypothesise drug likely prevent anti-VEGF drug mediate proteinuria individual use anti-hypertensive drug anti-hypertensive drug . 4 . To assess whether use ACEI ARB drug prognostic improve survival renal cell carcinoma anti-VEGF drug use . This confirmatory study base finding recent pool analysis renal cancer trial find user ACEI ARB improve overall progression free survival [ J Clin Oncol 32 , 2014 ( suppl 4 ; abstr 437 ) ] . The investigator aim undertake exploratory analysis provide great insight anti-VEGF drug mediate hypertension proteinuria raise hypotheses confirmation subsequent study , e.g . time frame , form extent BP change , BP change lead initiation anti-hypertensives , distribution anti-hypertensive strategy utilize , time-frame , form extent BP reduction . Baseline covariates influence risk hypertension proteinuria well predict extent BP reduction antihypertensive therapy .</detailed_description>
