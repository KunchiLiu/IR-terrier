	<brief_summary>This study cohort allo-HSCT recipient aim validate suitability improve T-Track® CMV assay assess functionality CMV protein-reactive effector cell suitability determine cut-off value mediate protection recurrent CMV reactivations allo-HSCT recipient . Lophius T-Track® CMV represent highly standardize sensitive diagnostic tool ass functionality network clinically relevant CMV-reactive effector cell . It base stimulation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) activate immunodominant CMV protein , pp65 IE-1 , subsequent quantification CMV-specific CMI ( spot form colony ) use highly sensitive IFN-γ ELISpot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CMV reactivation allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) associate significant morbidity increase overall mortality . Patients generally pre-emptively treated antiviral medication elevate level CMV copy peripheral blood plasma detect quantitative PCR . However , CMV reactivations often subclinical lead complication CMV disease . In case functional CMV- specific effector cell show mediate protection clinical symptom . Monitoring CMV- specific effector cell allo-HSCT could help prevent severe side effect due unnecessary antiviral treatment . Since majority patient develop one episode CMV reactivation , determination functional CMV-reactive effector cell cell mediate immunity ( CMI ) could also help predict likelihood relapse CMV reactivations thereby adjust need duration secondary prophylaxis . Currently available technique measure CMV-specific effector cell lack either functional read ( multimer stain ) time consume difficult standardize ( detection intracellular interferon gamma ( IFN-ᵞ ) vitro stimulation use flow cytometry ) . The improved T-Track® CMV assay advantage combine standardize highly sensitive test system functional read ( IFN-ᵞ production ) consider function antigen present cell ( APC ) different population clinically relevant effector cell ( CTL , T helper- , NK- , NKT cell ) . Based experience performance assay system healthy individual hemodialysis patient ( latter part performance evaluation - EUDAMED number 00015561 ) present trial aim validate improve variant test ( include optimize , LPS-depleted IE-1 protein ) regard suitability predict freedom relapse CMV-reactivation follow treatment CMV reactivation cohort 120-150 patient allo-HSCT . Moreover , result compare ( ) analysis leukocyte subpopulation ( ii ) multimer technique detect CMV-specific CD8 positive T lymphocyte ( CTL ) ( optional ) . Demonstrating suitability improve T-Track® CMV assay identify patient reduce risk recurrent CMV-reactivation , CMV disease GvHD would highly improve optimize follow-up care allo-HSCT regard therapy success well reduce public health care cost .</detailed_description>
