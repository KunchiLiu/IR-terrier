	<brief_summary>We study new way look abnormal areas/tissues colon colonoscopy . The current scope use colonoscopy good . But area n't look different naked eye , scope ca n't improve . We use special stain dye special scope see abnormal area hard see naked eye . The stain dye `` fluorescent '' , mean glow special light use colonoscopy scope . You ask let u spray peptide fluorescent tag onto colon . Peptides small chain amino acid ( build block make protein ) link together . The peptide use 7 amino acid attach fluorescent tag ( `` FIT C '' Fluoresceinisothiocyanate ) . FITC use eye doctor examine eye ( yellow eye drop ) . We test `` fluorescent peptide '' see stick abnormal area . If peptide `` stick '' , `` glow '' special light scope use . In study , apply fluorescent peptide colon use spray tube fit colonoscope . This phase IB study . This mean although apply peptide 25 people first research study , still need learn `` fluorescent peptide '' people . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve agent , allow u test study . The main goal study see peptide `` glow '' well take picture area glow . This research study peptide ability see `` glow fluoresce '' . Being study apply peptide wo n't change biopsy take colonoscopy do .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects felt increase risk CRC colonic polyp OR Subjects know colonic adenoma schedule colonic resection OR Subjects schedule outpatient colonoscopy follow surveillance IBD know dysplasia high risk high grade dysplasia . Subjects schedule outpatient colonoscopy medical procedure unit University Michigan Health Center All subject medically clear procedure ( e.g . washout anticoagulant , comorbidities ) meet inclusion/exclusion criterion include . Standard practice guideline safely proceed procedure sufficient study Adults age 18 100 year Willing able sign inform consent The effect Colon KCC Heptapeptide ( 5FITClabeled peptide ) develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test day procedure prior receive Colon KCC Heptapeptide ( 5FITClabeled peptide agent ) postmenopausal . Postmenopausal woman define posthysterectomy , 40 least 18 month without menses birthcontrol . Subjects know allergy negative reaction fluorescein derivative .
