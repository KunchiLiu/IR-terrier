	<brief_summary>Coming cardiac test daunt experience . Despite provide write information sheet patient , experience scanner demonstrate many patient ill-prepared attend cardiac compute tomography ( CT ) . Heart rate control essential high image quality , prolongs cardiac diastole ( image occurs ) result le motion blur , may challenge achieve context anxious patient . In situation , additional radiation exposure require optimise chance diagnostic image . Thus , poor patient selection preparation show increase radiation burden patient , well increase rate non-diagnostic scan , lead patient need additional , alternative testing . This distress patient increase downstream cost hospital . Poor patient awareness also know increase anxiety attend test . Improved patient information understand show improve outcome wide variety hospital setting . Evidence cardiac catheterisation angiography suggest use alternative information format reduce patient anxiety improve patient satisfaction , well improve understand technical requirement test . The latter may contribute improved preparation - example , patient understand requirement cardiac CT , particularly need slow heart rate , often consume caffeine , stop heart-slowing drug , even run cycle appointment . We agree collaboration Plymouth University create patient information video CT . These utilise expertise medium student ( department also run commercial arm , due quality output ) , conjunction clinical requirement patient participation group , create accessible , engage informative film . We wish evaluate impact method convey information patient well prepared undergo testing . If concept successful , may use patient undergo huge range test treatment across speciality . We therefore need demonstrate efficacy ( otherwise ) intervention .</brief_summary>
