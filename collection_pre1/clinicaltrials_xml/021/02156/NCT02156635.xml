	<brief_title>Stroke Treatment Associate Rehabilitation Therapy Transcranial DC Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke define acute neurological dysfunction vascular origin , subtle development clinical sign cerebral function disturbs , last 24h . The traditional therapy include drug physical rehabilitation , without systematization , complicate replication . The transcranial direct current ( DC ) stimulation might promote increase motor function hand , compare placebo stimulation . In fact , clinical trial point positive effect transcranial DC stimulation ( tDCS ) post-stroke intervention , however , general , include patient chronic stage , cerebral damage different area diverse disability , assist non-standardized physical therapy treatment . tDCS combine standardized physiotherapy program , note constraint-induced movement therapy ( CIMT ) , could able modulate cortical excitability promote good functional recovery . However , relate longitudinal study assess patient acute stage submit tDCS physiotherapy 6 month find . Studies like would help u elucidate action mechanism treatment early stage stroke . With mind , START - tDCS , phase II/III clinical trial , develop assess therapeutic effect tDCS early stage enrol 40 post-stroke patient . They allocate 2 group random receive active tDCS sham , associate CIMT . The protocol apply daily basis 10 consecutive working day ( 2 week ) , , patient follow 1 month . By end study , participant receive tDCS show well clinical condition invite participate bimonthly stimulation 12 month , part longitudinal study regard tDCS stroke . An increase clinical condition consider final score high 10 point Barthel Index , primary outcome , compare baseline , treatment protocol .</detailed_description>
