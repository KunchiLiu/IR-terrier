	<brief_summary>Background : - Lymphatics type vessel , similar artery vein . Lymphatic disorder happen vessel work properly . Researchers want look relationship lymphatic disorder variation certain gene find lung , blood , place body . Objective : - To learn lymphatic disorder evaluate genetic factor affect lymphatic disorder . Eligibility : - People age 2 90 lymphatic disorder relative people lymphatic disorder . - Healthy volunteer 18 old . Design : - Participants may 1 2 visit year , need . The study expect last 5 year . Visits may last 1 5 day . Participants may lab test , medical history , physical exam visit . - Participants may blood test include genetics test , urine test . They may nose throat culture , saliva collection , cheek swab collect sample . - Participants may skin biopsy blood take artery . - Participants may breathe test study exercise . - Participants may electrocardiogram . Electrodes place chest , trace heart rhythm . They may also chest X-rays . - Participants may bronchoscopy . A thin , flexible instrument pass nose mouth , lung . A tissue sample take . - Participants lymphatic disease relative may also : - CT scan . They lie table hold breath chest scan . - MRI . They lie flat table slide scanner . - ultrasound . A probe roll around outside abdomen . - removal fluid around lung , chest , abdomen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disorders lymphatic function associate multiple presentation , common lymphedema , chronic swell extremity , due impair lymphatic drainage . It cause disability predisposition infection chronic ulceration . Other lymphatic disorder present visceral manifestation regional systemic lymphangiomatosis , pulmonary intestinal lymphangiectasia , protein-losing enteropathy , chylous ascites , chylothorax . Abnormalities smooth muscle cell proliferation associate lymphangiomatosis . Proliferation neoplastic cell , LAM cell , exhibit smooth muscle cell phenotype , associate lymphangioleiomyomatosis . Currently , treatment many disorder symptomatic prognosis variable . The molecular mechanism lymphatic vasculogenesis incompletely understood , critical gene describe , mutation gene may lead developmental abnormality . There may genetic predisposition lymphatic disorder , role modifier gene disease progression . The purpose study ( ) define natural history lymphatic disease , ( b ) characterize clinical phenotype , ( Copyright ) elucidate pathogenesis physiological , cellular molecular level . This protocol part Trans-Institute basic , translational clinical initiative lymphatic disorder include participation principal investigator across NIH , well extramural investigator .</detailed_description>
