	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause disability morbidity Western world extend lead base continuous age European population . Apart persistent deficit , potentially avoidable medium- long-term complication significant contributor post-stroke functional impairment appeal target concerted intervention . Moreover , substantial gap risk factor management real life recommend international guideline , result large number avoidable recur event . Stroke Card prospective block-randomized open interventional trial blind outcome assessment compare two standard post-stroke patient care comply current state-of-the-art . Consecutive patient treat Department Neurology University Hospital Innsbruck ischemic stroke high-risk TIA allocate either standard care extend standard care accord Stroke Card concept enrol initial hospital stay . Recruitment patient two Austrian stroke center intend . The program complies respective guideline American Heart Association ( AHA ) , focus patient empowerment , patient self-management education , routine reporting general practitioner ( GP ) , evidence-based decision making , share knowledge , cooperation among physician .

Detailed assessment patient adherence drug prescription well lifestyle modification analysis key determinant . Implementation simple electronic tool patient ( `` My Stroke Card '' ) capable store data , display risk factor level time ( graph ) , give feedback target level achievement ( red , orange , green ) , provide information ( recommendation , self-administered patient training programme , etc ) , unravel post-stroke complication ( modify post-stroke checklist ) . The `` My Stroke Card '' also available print version patient without personal computer ( PC ) access . Scientific proof extend standard care ameliorate functional outcome patient wellbeing ( QoL ) , improve secondary prevention stroke vascular sequel without raise cost . Refinement Stroke Card component case success end condense practicable approach broad routine use , identification subgroup pronounce benefit .</detailed_description>
