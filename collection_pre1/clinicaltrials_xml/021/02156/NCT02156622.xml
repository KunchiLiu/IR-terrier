	<brief_summary>The purpose study adapt depression treatment intervention HIV patient Cameroon . The PI validate depression severity measure , adapt key element intervention Cameroon context , train nurse physician carry intervention , examine preliminary outcome .

	<detailed_description>Patient registry applicable Specific Aim 3 . This aim provide depression care management decision support depress HIV patient enrol . There comparison arm . This study R34 feasibility study adapt measurement-based depression care low income sub-Saharan African setting , Aim 3 assess logistics enrol monitoring patient . ( Per original protocol , follow ) Specific Aim 3 . Demonstrate feasibility recruit retain patient time collect process laboratory specimen . In aim investigator seek quantify objective measure feasibility plan RCT ass effectiveness MBC intervention ART treatment outcome HIV patient Cameroon . Specific measure include percentage eligible patient consent participate study , patient retention 12 month , percentage clinic visit outcome interview complete time point , percentage blood sample collect , test valid result . These measure important quantification sample size need definitive RCT . The investigator also identify procedure could hamper successful implementation RCT propose appropriate modification . Feasibility study : To achieve aim investigator conduct pilot prospective study sample 60 participant . This study begin year 2 project patient accrue 4 month ( 15 patient per month ) order allow smooth processing participant sample . Standard clinical care modify Bamenda ATC DCM screen newly present HIV patient depressive symptom PHQ-9 . Patients score ≥10 PHQ-9 ( alternate threshold establish validation study ) complete evaluation DCM presence MDD . These patient MDD confirm HIV clinician . This two-stage screening procedure successfully apply team rural medical clinic low income patient . The sampling frame feasibility study consist patient HIV+ , 18-55 year old , confirm MDD . Patients exclude speak English well enough complete instrument mentally competent provide inform consent , assess medical team . As noted , base Dr. Atashili 's clinical experience investigator expect &gt; 95 % clinic attendee able communicate effectively English . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study counsel regard particular risk benefit participation . AMI potential adversely affect develop fetus , primarily anticholinergic property , although recent observational study systematic review indicate increase risk congenital malformation developmental delay associate AMI use . Further , ADPs AMI potent agent act central nervous system , use nursing mother present theoretical short long-term risk infant 's neurodevelopment . Infant behavioral monitoring initiate treatment mother clinically useful monitor effect ADPs nursing . Infants may exhibit short-term effect lethargy , poor weight gain , hypotonia inconsolability , although limited data available show infant nurse mother take AMI dose consistent protocol detectable AMI level . Potential neonatal effect must weigh benefit mother child successfully treat MDD . These issue relate informed consent plan discuss detail Human Subjects Protection plan grant application . Each day , DCM follow random number algorithm randomly select 12 patient daily register schedule patient . The investigator expect sufficient generate 4 eligible consent participant per week ( assume 25 % show rate , 10 % prevalence MDD &lt; 20 % refusal ) ~15 per month adjust need order meet recruitment goal . The DCM ass eligibility invite eligible patient participate . Non-consenting patient ask reason denial . All patient MDD ( consent ) propose management plan DCM ( describe Aim 2 ) discuss treat physician . Participants encourage , extent wish , bring family member appointment involve social support structure depression treatment plan . For consent patient DCM collect whole blood sample assess viral load , CD4 count , liver function . These sample store -20o C transport CSCCD laboratory test use standard procedure - VL use automate Roche Amplicor assay HIV VL , CD4 count use flow cytometry . The DCM issue follow-up plan participant collect contact information ( home address phone number available ) remind patient follow-up appointment . To assist patient provider balance pregnancy- breastfeeding-related risk benefit AMI use , female participant take urine pregnancy test enrollment annually thereafter long remain AMI . Female participant pregnant advise discus plan fertility provider , wish become pregnant counsel either avoid sexual intercourse use contraception . Of note , HIV+ patient Bamenda strongly counsel either practice abstinence use barrier method protection sexual intercourse order avoid HIV transmission , secondary effect avoid pregnancy . Follow-up visit aim assess effect ARV ADP treatment . Assessment depressive symptom ADP side effect occur every 2 week remission every 4 week thereafter . Assessments week 12 , 24 , etc . occur regularly schedule clinic visit ART prescription refill . Patients return clinic additional in-person assessment week 2 , 4 , 8 ; assessment week 6 10 conduct phone feasible else person . Based Dr. Atashili 's experience patient population , investigator expect approximately 50 % participant reliably reachable phone . Project fund pay additional clinic visit require protocol . Critical decision point potential modification depression treatment plan ( e.g. , maintain dose , increase dose , switch ADP ) occur week 4 , 8 , 12 inform depressive symptom response side effect describe Aim 2 . Clinical assessment HIV disease blood sample CD4 count viral load conduct visit 4 , 8 12 month follow-up ; follow-up liver function test perform base clinical indication . Pregnancy test repeat annually . Patients counsel avoid alcohol consumption , DCM clinically monitor alcohol use ask patient follow-up . Separate ongoing contact DCM , participant complete in-person interview baseline month 4 , 8 , 12 ass self-reported general health , ADP ARV adherence , sexual risk behavior . These in-person interview conduct CSCCD interviewer part participant ' clinical care minimize potential social desirability bias . Interviews conduct private location participant 's choosing last ~30 minute . General health measure Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-8 ( SF-8 ) . Adherence medication measure four visual analog scale ( VAS ) item ask patient proportion time past month take medication dose ; take medication prescribe ; miss skipped dos ; take dos time . VAS adherence measure correlate well self-report measure adherence predict virologic failure . Sexual risk behavior measure question ask participant frequency oral , anal , vaginal sexual intercourse precede 4 month , separately sex partner , partner 's HIV status , whether condom use . The interview additionally include question age , sex , religious ethnic identification , educational attainment , household income . Finally , interview include question acceptability intervention , include patient ' perception additional time cost impose intervention well willingness ability purchase ADPs ( current cost &lt; $ 1 per month ) intervention part standard clinical care rather research study . As second measure adherence , investigator collect pharmacy record quantity date HIV psychiatric medication dispense study participant period start 4 month study enrollment end follow-up . All patient receive HIV care Bamenda ATC obtain HIV medication hospital pharmacy , would also source ADP medication prescribe part study . Adherence calculate ratio number day ' supply medication divide day elapse next refill . Adherence measure pharmacy refill show setting associate virologic outcome . The DCM attempt contact patient miss visit either call participant phone number available visit patient 's home . The investigator recognize patient phone number poor identification ( name number ) streets/homes constitute challenge identify participant ' home . The investigator expect 50 % participant phone number .</detailed_description>
