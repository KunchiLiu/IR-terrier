	<brief_title>Embolization Large Spontaneous Portosystemic Shunts Prevention Post-TIPS Refractory Hepatic Encephalopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) use 20 year since 1988 treat complication portal hypertension , especially variceal bleed ascites refractory conventional therapy . However , procedure two major disadvantage : shunt dysfunction hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) . Notabley , use expand polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) -covered stent significantly reduce risk shunt dysfunction , post-TIPS HE remain problem even new stent . The incidence post-TIPS HE range 5 % 35 % HE first year tend particularly frequent first month TIPS le common time . Meta-analysis increase age , prior HE high Child-Pugh class/score robust predictor post-TIPS HE . There consensus management post-TIPS HE . Episodic HE TIPS treat traditionally . The cornerstone treatment type HE identification treatment precipitate event general support patient . Refractory HE respond standard treatment , opinion , important problem face patient treat TIPS . In case , occurrence complication may deeply reduce patient 's quality life cure may worse disease . Refractory HE treat reduce diameter stent occlude shunt . However , procedure without danger may solve problem patient , complication portal hypertension , varix refractory ascites , suppose manage TIPS , may recur consequence shunt reduction occlusion . Besides , establish method drug effectively prevent occurrence HE TIPS . One possibility use stent small diameter , since post-TIPS HE relate amount blood shunt . Riggio et al . compare incidence HE TIPS create 8-or 10-mm PTFE-covered stent study stop high complication due portal hypertension TIPS 8-mm group . Our center perform RCT evaluate effectiveness L-ornithine-L-aspartate ( LOLA ) plasma ammonia cirrhotic patient TIPS . Another RCT reevaluate effect TIPS 8- 10-mm covered stent prevention variceal rebleeding cirrhotic patient also undergo . But large spontaneous portosystemic shunt ( SPSS ) , embolization might also represent therapeutic target.SPSS , name implies , potential communication portal venous circulation systemic venous circulation open , develop , potentially grow enable flow within one circulation ( portal venous ) high pressure obstruct effort reduce pressure bypass obstruction . SPSS mainly include splenorenal shunt , gastrorenal shunt , paraesophageal vein , paraumbilical vein , et al . For patient decompensated cirrhosis , portal vein pressure increase significantly blood diverted systemic circulation collateral vessel splenorenal vein , short gastric vein , posterior gastric vein , , namely SPSS . The nature history SPSS patient liver cirrhosis still unclear . Most patient diagnosed chance . Previous report suggest incidence SPSS 16 % patient liver cirrhosis portal hypertension incidence refractory HE 46 % . A study publish 2005 reveal 71 % patient cirrhosis refractory HE large SPSS . Therefore , presence SPSS provide explanation persistence recurrence HE despite acceptable liver function , might also represent therapeutic target . Nowadays , several series report embolization large SPSSs treatment chronic therapy-refractory HE.To date , data safety efficacy embolization large SPSS prevention post-TIPS HE .</detailed_description>
