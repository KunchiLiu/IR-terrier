	<brief_title>Identification Breath Biomarkers Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck cancer diagnosis devastate frequently disrupt one 's ability communicate , swallow breathe . Each year , physician diagnose approximately 650,000 case head neck cancer worldwide . Many people head neck cancer cancer detect late , result poor clinical outcome . One strategy improve clinical outcome people head neck cancer develop non-invasive screen assay use breath biomarkers . Such diagnostic tool identify at-risk individual early , potentially offer improved cost-effective treatment . The idea use human breath sample detect cancer begin observation dog train `` sniff '' certain type cancer urine blood . Since presence various volatile organic compound many type cancer , include : lung , skin , breast , prostate , bladder characterize . These study ongoing , promise revolutionize way physician screen cancer future . In pilot study , Investigators aim determine specific volatile organic compound present breath sample patient oral cavity oropharyngeal cancer tumor resection , definitive chemotherapy/radiotherapy . As head neck cancer result significant functional deficit , early detection key improve clinical outcome . Much anecdotal evidence exists presence distinct odor emission tumor bed head neck cancer patient . Therefore , identification specific volatile organic compound head neck cancer undoubtedly lead novel , cost-effective screening strategy early detection head neck cancer .</detailed_description>
