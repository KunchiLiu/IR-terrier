	<brief_title>Correlation Between Power Doppler Intraoperative Findings Chronic Acute Cholecystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gray-scale sonography generally consider first-line diagnostic tool patient suspect gallbladder ( GB ) diseases . Once gallstone detect patient complain abdominal pain right upper quadrant , second concern differential diagnosis , biliary colic acute cholecystitis . Certain diagnosis acute cholecystitis important , two entity require different treatment . Gray-scale sonography proven valuable imaging technique differential diagnosis acute chronic cholecystitis ( 1 ) . In presence gallstone , sonographic finding GB wall thicken Murphy 's sign 90 % sensitivity diagnosis acute cholecystitis ( 2 ) . On hand , abdominal pain accompany GB wall thicken see different clinical scenario , pancreatitis , hepatitis , cirrhosis , congestive heart failure . Thus , specificity sonographic finding high sensitivity . To eliminate diagnostic concern , need correlation diagnostic tool disease physiopathology realize . The GB wall thicken vascularisation increase acute cholecystitis , chronic cholecystitis thicken GB wall cause fibrosis . This pathologic difference key point distinguish acute chronic cholecystitis . Determining vascularisation GB wall Doppler sonography show valuable diagnostic benefit , diagnostic superiority obtain especially power Doppler sonography ( 3 ) . Today , laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) become gold standard treatment benign biliary disease . Although , laparoscopic approach acute cholecystitis lot advantage , ; less postoperative pain , short hospital stay well cosmetic result , time operation intraoperative finding GB wall inflammation adhesion critical perform safe cholecystectomy . The risk bleed bile duct injury significantly increase presence severe inflammation adhesion ( 4 ) . These finding may lead surgeon convert LC open cholecystectomy . In theory , increase vascularity GB wall could associate intraoperative finding , , GB wall inflammation accompany adhesion . There enough report literature describe correlation GB wall vascularity operative finding accord adhesion score scale . In prospective clinical study , aim highlight correlation preoperative power Doppler sonography detect GB wall vascularity intraoperative finding - postoperative outcome chronic acute cholecystitis patient .</detailed_description>
