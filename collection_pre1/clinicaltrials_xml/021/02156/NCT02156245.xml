	<brief_summary>The aim study assess efficacy rehabilitation protocol base individualize combine eccentric concentric cycle ergometer training compare classical concentric cycle training among patient either coronary artery disease ( CAD ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . This study therefore evaluate efficacy combine eccentric/concentric training physical capacity overall autonomy , analyse adaptive mechanism regard adaptation cardiac muscular effort tolerance . The research take place 3 phase : PHASE 1 ( DURATION 6 MONTHS ) : 30 healthy volunteer include test tolerance personalize exercise eccentric cycle ergometer . PHASE 2 ( DURATION 6 MONTHS ) : 15 patient suffer coronary artery disease ( CAD ) 15 patient suffer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) include test protocol . PHASE 3 ( DURATION 24 MONTHS ) : A total 169 patient split 2 parallel group include : group receive conventional rehabilitation ( group A ) group receive eccentric exercise combine conventional rehabilitation ( group B ) . Coronary patient : 93 patient include ( 62 patient group A 31 group B ) . COPD patient : 76 patient include ( 38 patient per group ) .</brief_summary>
