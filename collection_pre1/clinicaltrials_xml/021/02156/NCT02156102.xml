	<brief_summary>Background : - People sickle cell disease blood disorder sometimes get chronic leg ulcer . These wound develop skin go away . Current treatment work well , researcher want learn ulcer happen . They want find bacteria may cause , external factor play role . Objective : - To study social environmental factor sickle cell disease cause sickle cell disease leg ulcer . Eligibility : - People age 18 old sickle cell disease another red cell disorder , without active leg ulcer . Design : - Participants medical history clinical evaluation . They also blood drawn . - Participants complete questionnaire life , health , environment , stress , topic . - Participants may provide small sample hair . - Participants ask collect small amount saliva . - Participants leg ulcer skin microbiome sample . The microbiome microbe ( bacteria and/or fungi ) gene body . Researchers use swabs collect skin sample . Photographs take skin sample area . - Some participant without leg ulcer also skin microbiome sample . - Some participant skin microbiome sample return second visit . At visit , microbiome resampled . It take place 30 day first visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Insights Into Microbiome Environmental Contributions Sickle Cell Disease Leg Ulcers Study ( INSIGHTS Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leg ulcer serious debilitate complication sickle cell disease ( SCD ) . This study explore factor , namely microbial , genomic , environmental ( social physical ) , may influence onset progression leg ulcer formation delay heal individual live SCD . There variation incidence duration SCD leg ulcer . They often painful , resistant treatment , recurrent nature . The etiology SCD associate leg ulcer unclear , hypothesize predisposition develop leg ulcer multifactorial . This multisite study exploratory study microbiome environment individual live sickle cell disease leg ulcer . The study objective identify trigger may integral leg ulcer onset progression . The central goal study obtain improved understanding participant leg ulcer microbiome psychosocial environmental factor may increase one likelihood develop complication . To achieve goal , characterize leg skin microbiome SCD patient live without leg ulcer within United States . In addition assess microbiome , collect social physical environmental data ass quality life indicator individual SCD without leg ulcer leg ulcer . In addition , examine psychosocial impact leg ulcer individual SCD conduct qualitative phase explore individual experience understand physical function , stigma , selfesteem associate active , recurrent , singleoccurrence presentation leg ulcer . To accomplish objective , indepth , semistructured interview methodology employ . This afford participants chance expound upon exist question provide u opportunity understand complexity participant experience quality life .</detailed_description>
