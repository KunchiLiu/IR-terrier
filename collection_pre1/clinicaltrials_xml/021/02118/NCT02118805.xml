	<detailed_description>Speech swallow abnormality important symptom associate disorder central nervous system , motor neuron disease ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) , myasthenia gravis , primary muscle condition . In addition characterize evolution muscle architecture could underlie associate orofacial weakness , identify new way measure abnormalities critical development test novel treatment approach . As painless , non-invasive , portable technology , quantitative ultrasonography ( QUS ) electrical impedance myography ( EIM ) could meet need objective measure speech swallow dysfunction . In QUS , acoustic energy apply muscle interest ; resultant pictorial data translate single value reflect health imaged muscle . Similarly , EIM , high-frequency , low-intensity alternate electrical current apply individual muscle , result voltage measure . Impedance value reflect change muscle architecture , include fiber atrophy , inflammation , replacement muscle fat connective tissue . Both user-friendly method provide sensitive indicator neuromuscular disease status apply limb . Although also use evaluate orofacial muscle healthy volunteer patient primary muscle disorder , yet systematically studied patient range neurological condition . When applied muscle face tongue , tool could 1 . Improve accuracy early diagnosis ; 2 . Allow monitor speech swallow dysfunction time ; 3 . Help individualize care ; 4 . Serve biomarkers clinical trial . We propose QUS EIM provide convenient , reliable , clinically meaningful surrogate marker orofacial dysfunction variety neurologic condition .</detailed_description>
