	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate drug call omalizumab ( brand name 'Xolair ' ) potential treatment use conjunction drug desensitization prevent reaction recur allow participant treat chemotherapy participant 's oncologist prefers give .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Omalizumab Adjuvant Therapy Chemotherapy Desensitization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screen procedure confirm eligibility : - The participant receive dose 300mg omalizumab skin every four week three separate visit represent treatment period 12 week . - During entire course study , participant continue receive chemotherapy per oncologist 's prescribed schedule via desensitization supervise Allergy specialist BWH/DFCI Desensitization Team . The participant receive omalizumab day desensitization however . - A careful review participant 's symptom do desensitization study fill questionnaire detail reaction , , participant experience desensitization study period . Additionally , Allergy specialist document complication , , experience participant 's medical record , note also collect part monitoring study period . - The participant may skin test agent desensitize course study . This would part initial allergy consultation prior participant 's enrollment Desensitization Program . If skin test positive , participant undergo repeat skin test agent conclusion treatment period ( week 12 ) see omalizumab effective change skin test outcomes participant 's chemotherapy allergy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Patients type I hypersensitivity reaction chemotherapy agent include , exclusive , platins , taxanes , monoclonal agent evidence typical IgEmediated symptom ( ie . flushing , hive , dyspnea , wheeze , nausea , itchy eye , nasal congestion , hypotension , angioedema ) For various reason , , , patient enrol desensitization program may positive skin test data confirm IgEmediated reaction . These reason include 1 ) cutaneous toxicity drug precludes test 2 ) limit sensitivity skin test depend drug test 3 ) lack adequate testing reagent control . Patients breakthrough reaction require multiple desensitization intervention include 16 step protocol intervention additional antihistamine ( require &gt; 50mg IV diphenhydramine po hydroxyzine ; OR &gt; 10mg cetirizine loratadine ) All cancer patient receive chemotherapy agent , age 18 . A positive skin test allergyinducing agent elevate tryptase level set infusion reaction . Clinical indication additional dos chemotherapy determine patient 's oncologist . Patients stable enough undergo chemotherapy determine patient 's oncologist . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . We expect majority study patient woman ovarian cancer patient population frequently receive platin therapy paclitaxel first line therapy . This patient population also high risk develop hypersensitivity reaction platinbased agent since patient often receive multiple round chemotherapy . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Medically unable undergo desensitization . Unable provide inform consent . Known sensitivity omalizumab . Participants may receive study agent . Chemotherapy treatment schedule &lt; 12 week Pregnant woman . Women childbearing potential use two form birth control study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Uncontrolled illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients underlie primary mast cell disease ( ie . mastocytosis ) Pregnant woman exclude study carboplatin , cisplatin , oxaliplatin chemotherapeutic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother platinbased agent , breastfeed discontinue . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
