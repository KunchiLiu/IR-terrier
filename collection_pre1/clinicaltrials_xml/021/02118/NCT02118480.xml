	<brief_summary>The study design parallel-group randomized trial equal randomization . Recruitment enrollment conduct June 2012 January 2013 . At base-line , clinical , cognitive functional data collect . Afterwards , participant randomly allocate either REHACOP group Control group . During 3 month intervention REHACOP program take place follow-up patient re-evaluated evaluate change clinical , cognitive functional measure . Post-treatment assessment ( finish June 2013 ) perform within first week complete intervention.Optional enrollment pre- post neuroimaging also allow u look change brain . Finally , longitudinal follow-up 18 month neuropsychological neuroimaging assessements also perform . Objective : To examine efficacy integrative cognitive training program ( REHACOP ) improve cognition , clinical symptom functional disability patient Parkinson disease ( PD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assessment protocol : - Cognitive Evaluation : The cognitive battery include assessment evaluate processing speed , verbal learn memory , visual learn memory executive functioning . All cognitive measure convert Z-scores base pooled PD group , sign measure adjust high score indicate well cognitive performance . All composite cognitive domain maintain satisfactory internal consistency . Processing Speed ( Cronbach 's α = 0.85 ) quantify base Trail Making Test-A Salthouse Letter Comparison Test . For verbal learning memory ( α = 0.88 ) , learn long-term recall performance Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( version 2 baseline 4 post-treatment ) utilize . For visual learning memory ( α = 0.96 ) , learn long-term recall performance Brief Visual Memory Test ( version 1 baseline 3 post-treatment ) use ( α = 0.96 ) . Executive functioning ( α = 0.78 ) determine base Stroop test , use word-color interference score . Theory mind ( TOM ) . The strange story test ( Happé test ) administer evaluate TOM . Four different story ( concern double bluff , mistake , persuasion white lie ) administer baseline follow-up , sum total TOM score possible range 0 8 . Higher score indicate good TOM . - Premorbid intelligence quotient cognitive reserve . The Accentuation Reading Test ( TAP ) , Spanish version National Adult Reading Test ( NART ) , administer calculate estimation patient´s premorbid intelligence . The scale range 0 30 . Cognitive reserve estimate use Cognitive Reserve questionnaire . This 15-item multiple-choice questionnaire include question education/culture , work activity , leisure hobby , physical activity social activity . Higher score indicate well cognitive reserve , scale range 0 26 . - Global cognitive status . The Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) administer obtain general mental status score . - Medication use . Medications , dosage dose frequency use calculate levodopa-equivalent daily dose ( mg/day ) ( LEDD ) . - PD assessment . The Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale use assessment course stage disease . - Depressive symptom . Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS-15 ) include 15 item . Higher score represent high degree depression ( range 0 15 ) . - Neuropsychiatric symptom . The NPI-Q administered evaluate neuropsychiatric symptom . The test include 10 item ( delusion , hallucination , agitation/aggression , depression/dysphoria , anxiety , euphoria , apathy , disinhibition , irritability aberrant motor behavior ) . These sub-scales sum total score possible range 0 120 . Higher score indicate frequent severe neuropsychiatric symptom . - Apathy . The Lille apathy rating scale consist 33 item , include 9 sub-scales ( everyday productivity , interest , take initiative , novelty seeking/motivation , emotional response , concern , social life self-awareness ) . These sub-scales sum total apathy score possible range -36 36 . Lower score indicate less apathy . - Functional disability . Functional disability self administer use World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II ( WHO-DAS II ) , short version ( 12 item ) . Description intervention : - REHACOP structured program use paper-pencil task base principle restoration , compensation optimization gradually increase level cognitive effort demand . REHACOP train different cognitive domain , attention , memory , process speed , language , executive function social cognition . Additionally , program include one unit related functional outcome : activity daily live . REHACOP include 300 different task hierarchically organize least three level difficulty subtypes ability . Several task time , process speed train throughout various module . Once basic cognitive strategy train well acquire , therapist transition program next level . The program format allow either individual group session ( 5 8 patient per group ) , although purpose study , group session choose . In study , two psychologist conduct REHACOP group attend 60-minute-long session 3 day per week Parkinson Disease Association Biskay ( ASPARBI ) ( two group ) Hospital Galdakao ( one group ) . Specifically , REHACOP group remediation PD patient consist : Attention unit ( 4 week ) training sustain , selective , alternant divide attention ; Memory unit ( 3 week ) focus visual verbal learning , recall recognize memory ; Language unit ( 3 week ) include grammar , syntax , vocabulary , verbal fluency , verbal comprehension , abstract language ; Executive function unit ( 2 week ) train cognitive planning , proverb , analogy ; Social cognition unit ( 1 week ) exercise theory mind , social reason moral dilemma . - Occupational Activities : The Control group consist occupational group activity conduct psychologist ASPARBI . The activity include drawing , read daily news construct use different material ( paper wood ) . These activity accomplish group format frequency implementation REHACOP experimental group . A subset sample also complete pre post neuroimaging evaluate change structural functional brain activation .</detailed_description>
