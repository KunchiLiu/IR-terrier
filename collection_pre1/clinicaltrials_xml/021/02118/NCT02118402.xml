	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anemia health issue affect mainly infant woman develop country . Iron deficiency infancy long-lasting impact cognitive motor development child . Iron fortification show effective anemia . However , area high burden infectious disease iron may increase risk unfavorable gut microbiota composition possibly influence diarrhea prevalence . Therefore want assess effect home fortification complementary food two iron-containing micronutrient powder ( MNPs ) without addition prebiotic ( 7.5 g galactooligosaccharides GOS-75 ) compare control composition gut microbiota Kenyan infant . In study use MNP moderate iron dose 5 mg , 2.5 mg Fe NaFeEDTA 2.5 mg Fe ferrous fumarate ( +Fe ) . There 3 study group MNP , MNP+Fe MNP+Fe+GOS . The infant enrol study age 6-10 month consume home-fortified maize porridge four month . At baseline endpoint ( 4 month intervention ) , collect blood sample infant order ass anemia , iron status , inflammation . Fecal sample ( child mother ) collect baseline , 3 week endpoint order evaluate change gut microbiota gut inflammation . During intervention , sub-group child receive broad-spectrum antibiotic , compare three different intervention modify effect antibiotic infant gut microbiota . We opportunistically select child enrol study become ill , prescribe antibiotic local health care team , accord local standard care study area . Five additional stool sample child collect ( day 0 ( first antibiotic dose ) , 5 , 10 , 20 40 ) evaluate change gut microbiota gut inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fifty infant per group enrol ( n=150 ) randomly divide three group , identify select village catchment area Kikoneni Health Clinic southern coastal Kenya , 2 hour south Mombasa . All child whose caregiver agree participate study iron status assess measurement hemoglobin ( Hb ) , erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin ( ZPP ) , serum ferritin ( SF ) serum transferrin receptor ( TfR ) . Enrolled subject randomize three group . Group 1 receive MNP alone , group 2 receive identical MNP iron ( 2.5 mg Fe NaFeEDTA 2.5 mg ferrous fumarate ) , group 3 receive MNP iron ( 2.5 mg Fe NaFeEDTA 2.5 mg ferrous fumarate ) 7.5 mg galactooligosaccharides GOS-75 . Each household receive 2 kg maize meal per week caregiver participate child show prepare maize porridge , widely-used local complementary food . This maize meal provide free-of-charge participating family . The caregiver add one MNP sachet day portion maize porridge , feed entire portion infant . The Kikoneni Clinic serve collection point MNPs , monitor center surveillance infant health , well blood stool collection point . At baseline endpoint intervention ( 4 month ) , blood sample collect infant measurement Hb , SF , TfR ZPP define anemia iron status C-reactive protein ( CRP ) define systemic inflammation status . At baseline , 3 week 4 month , stool sample collect infant his/her mother , measurement gut microbiota gut inflammation.The mother train collect stool sample home provide container tight , screw-top lid , include Anerocult® sachet create anaerobic environment . At 3 timepoints ( baseline , 3 week 4 month ) mother bring two stool sample day , label keep 4°C . The sample transfer central lab , fill 2 ml Eppendorf tube , label frozen -20°C . In addition , compliance morbidity assess weekly distribution MNPs . The child check referred health center clinicians whenever indicated clinical history . In case fever , rapid malaria test ( RTD ) kit perform accord local guideline . If test result positive , child treat presumptive malaria , mild malaria case treat Kikoneni clinic per WHO Integrated management childhood illness ( IMCI ) guideline . Cases diarrhea treat accord local standard care include oral rehydration salt , necessary , antibiotic . If deem necessary Kikoneni clinical management , study team support clinic stock ORS , iron supplement antimalaric drug study duration . Anthropometry ( weight , height , age sex ) record baseline endpoint use standardized procedure calculate prevalence child stunt . The measurement do twice average use data analysis . The data analysis software WHO Anthro ( WHO , Geneva Switzerland ) use calculate prevalence stunting among infant population . To investigate effect oral antibiotic infant gut microbiota select first 12 infant three study group become ill study receive broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment . We also select 6 non-treated control study group match sex week MNP consumption . A total n=54 child include sub study collect five additional stool sample select child determine gut microbiota composition . The first stool sample collect start antibiotic treatment ( day 0 ) . Thereafter , stool sample collect day 5 , 10 , 20 40 . Stool sample collect described . Besides additional stool sample child continue intervention accord main protocol . A breast milk sample collect 90 mother two time point ( week 3 week 16 ) . These sample analyze concentration human milk oligosaccharide , potential source natural prebiotics .</detailed_description>
