	<detailed_description>Background DM1 rare , inherit , progressive disease well autosomal dominant multisystemic disorder . It common adult form muscular dystrophy , prevalence approximately 10 per 100,000 people affect . With 733 million people Europe , estimate 75,000 people DM1 patient Europe . Typical symptoms disease include progressive muscle weakness waste distal proximal , ptosis , weakness facial , jaw anterior neck muscle , myotonia , daytime sleepiness , fatigue cataract . Other symptom adult DM1 include cardiac conduction defect , well endocrine , gastrointestinal cognitive dysfunction . DM1 one variable human disease , complex , multisystemic progressively worsen clinical manifestation lead severe physical impairment , restrict social participation premature death . There pharmaceutical treatment causal symptomatic relief DM1 core symptom ( exception Modafinil excessive daytime sleepiness ) . Thus aim treatment relieve impairment , reduce limitation optimise participation . Physical activity acknowledge important factor health general . For patient slowly progressive neuromuscular disease , DM1 , accumulate evidence prescribe low-to-moderate-intensity strength aerobic exercise training , active lifestyle . Nevertheless , recent review conclude exist study limit number quality , need disease-specific , randomise , control trial investigate effect quality life . RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY It demonstrate recently OPTIMISTIC research partner severe fatigue , define score equal high 35 subscale fatigue Checklist Individual Strength ( CIS-fatigue ) , report around 70 % patient DM1 . These severely fatigued patient problem physical social functioning well mental general health similar patient without severe fatigue . They also problem concentration plan . As , experience fatigue clearly distinguish muscle weakness , probably common characteristic symptom DM1 also lack initiative ( apathy ) know occur often DM1 . In longitudinal study , build model perpetuate factor fatigue patient DM1 . It appear lack physical activity , sleep disturbance pain contribute experienced fatigue . In addition , loss muscle strength pain contribute fatigue low level physical activity . Ultimately , experience fatigue physical activity contribute level societal participation . A lack initiative increase fatigue also direct negative effect societal participation . Thus , theoretically , order improve societal participation one compensate reduce initiative , optimise physical activity alleviate experience fatigue . To alleviate fatigue one address fatigue maintain factor identify model , e.g . experience pain sleep disorder . The main rationale combination CBT physical activity base DM1-specific model . The DM1-specific model show physical activity , experience fatigue lack initiative main determinant DM1 health status . OPTIMISTIC first model-based clinical trial DM1 . It evaluate effect , maintenance effect , CBT combine exercise training reduction chronic fatigue patient DM1 . Importantly , intervention also involve caregiver willing take part . The disability associate DM1 put considerable strain caregiver also lead negative interaction patient . The intervention aim support caregiver instal realistic expectation expect patient , teach caregiver help patient stay self-reliant possible also reduce caregiver strain taking time . If DM1 patient caregiver significant , caregiver significant willing take part study , patient exclude study . All patient ask study team could approach inform research . This contact constitute consent . ** CMRI-substudy People DM1 People DM1 high risk develop cardiac complication . However , know whether high prevalence cardiac complication affect sedentary lifestyle . Given high risk cardiac complication possibility become physically active may help complication , University Newcastle , conduct sub-study perform Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CMRI ) 40 eligible participant baseline end intervention period acquire evidence upon clinical judgement use exercise clinical therapy safe , base . Cardiac Magnetic resonance imaging ( CMRI ) use combination harmless radiofrequency ( RF ) wave powerful magnet cause hydrogen nucleus within cardiac cell molecule vibrate emit RF energy . The MRI scanner detect energy emission convert viewable image . When diseases begin , change heart 's tissue . Because even minor change tissue affect rate energy emit , many medical condition detect early stage . MRI do evaluate structure function heart blood vessel . MRI may provide information obtain test chest X-ray , ECG , echocardiogram , nuclear test . The CMRI examination perform contract enhancement gadolinium , 40 eligible participant , 20 group . Participants undergo : 1. cardiac cine imaging , evaluate cardiac morphology 2. systolic diastolic function 3. cardiac tag evaluate wall motion torsion . MRI safety establish prior baseline end intervention scan . This include ; assess vivo ferrous material , claustrophobia , abnormal renal function pregnancy . The PI assess renal function participant 's medical note screen , require blood test U &amp; Es request . In addition , child-bearing potential female participant consent urine pregnancy test perform . For participant baseline CMRI withdraw study prior end intervention period , invited end study CMRI period initial CMRI great 3 month . No statistical review require CMRI sub-study frequency association assess .</detailed_description>
