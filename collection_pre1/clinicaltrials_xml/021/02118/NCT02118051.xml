	<brief_summary>Patients expect poor ovarian response ( POR ) , meet criterion Bologna , benefit ovarian stimulation 150 mg alpha Corifollitropin ( CFA ) ( Elonva ® ) single dose week , cycle vitro fertilization ( IVF ) . In study aim demonstrate non-inferiority Corifollitropin Alpha ( CFA ) versus daily administration Human Menopausal Gonadotropin ( hMG ) ( Menopur ® ) first seven day ovarian stimulation , protocol gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) antagonist</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Treatment With Corifollitropin Alpha Vitro Fertilization Patients With Poor Ovarian Response .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One significant problem fertilization treatment Controlled Ovarian Stimulation low responsiveness . The incidence low ovarian response estimate around 10-25 % .The wide range prevalence report literature explain lack consensus exist criterion low response . The ovarian response gonadotropin stimulation crucial successful assist reproduction technique .Cycles low rate response obtain increased cancellation rate bad pregnancy rate . Different criterion definition low response , different test assess ovarian reserve different threshold value use . In 2010 group expert ESHRE , achieve consensus criterion low ovarian response homogenize study group reach meaningful conclusion , know `` The Bologna criterion '' , define `` Poor Ovarian Response '' ( POR ) . There sufficient recommend propose treatment improve pregnancy rate poor responder evidence . Taking account profile equivalence safety CFA ( Corifollitropin Alpha , active ELONVA ® ) , different study conclude CFA alternative daily injection recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( rFSH ) normal responder patient vitro fertilization cycle ovarian stimulation.But research need determine whether long-acting recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( rFSH ) safe effective use woman low high response . The ovarian control stimulation Alpha Corifollitropin produce significantly oocyte compare recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( r FSH ) administrate daily normal responder patient , For reason , use Alpha Corifollitropin may beneficial patient poor response number oocytes retrieve crucial successful treatment There two study result compare ovarian stimulation daily rFSH vs CFA . In show , retrospectively prospectively , CFA seem least effective hMG recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( rFSH ) daily . There scientific publication show association luteinizing hormone ( LH ) recombinant follicle stimulate hormone ( rFSH ) improve embryos quality achieve well pregnancy rate . The pregnancy rate statistically significant , normal responder patient . Recently report beneficial effect POR patient treat CFA hMG . The IVF treatment know affect physical mental condition patient infertility , excess emotional stress one important reason discontinuation treatment . The ovarian stimulation CFA simplify treatment , reduce administration multiple daily injection , may reduce emotional burden patient .</detailed_description>
