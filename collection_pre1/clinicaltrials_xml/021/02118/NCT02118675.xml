	<brief_summary>The study collect body composition data use five different methods-bioimpedance analysis ( TanitaÂ® ) , DXA ( GE Medical ) , BodPod ( Life Medical ) , deuterium dilution ( heavy water ) , body circumference ( tape measure , TC2 ) , tissue thickness ultrasound ( GE Medical , BodyMetrix ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If eligible choose participate study , ask come Pennington Biomedical Research Center Baton Rouge 7:00 11:00am 10-hour fast ( nothing eat drink besides water 10 hour prior appointment ) . The study visit take approximately five hour . During visit , complete inform consent process complete several body measurement body composition procedure immediately afterwards . Description study procedure Body Measurements ( 10 minute ) : A series body measurement take trained staff . These measurement include height weight . These measurement complete twice time . You wear hospital gown bathing suit measurement . Your BMI calculate measurement . Body Composition Circumference Measurements Deuterium Dilution ( heavy water ) This test measure amount water body . After fast urine sample collect , drink glass water enrich atom call stable isotope ( deuterium ) . After drink non-radioactive heavy water , provide urine sample several time next 4 hour . Whole Body DXA Scan , 20 minute This scan measure amount bone , muscle , fat body . The scan perform use whole-body scanner . You require wear hospital gown , remove metal-containing object body , lie table . You carefully position table , leg place together use two Velcro strap . A scanner emit low energy X-rays detector pas along body . You ask remain completely still scan progress . The scan take approximately ten minute . Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) ( 20 minute ) : These test measure amount fat body . You ask change hospital gown remove footwear socks/stockings . Once change barefoot , ask stand scale ( similar large gym scale ) hold hand electrode side scale . You ask step scale measurement complete ( less one minute ) . You repeat procedure three different BIA system . BodPod ( 30 minute ) This test estimate amount fat mass fat free mass body . You require change swimsuit swim cap provide procedure . If swimsuit meet necessary criterion , bring wear procedure , PBRC provide one . You step onto scale quick weight measurement . Next , sit inside system like sit chair . The door system close , window see outside system measurement complete . The test complete 15 minute . Circumferences ( 30 minute ) This test measure circumference waist , hip , neck , arm , legs lengths forearm , upper arm , thigh , low leg . The circumference measurement make train observer use calibrate tape measure automate circumference measurement device ( KX-16 ) . These measurement make 30 minute . Ultrasound ( 30 minute ) An ultrasound procedure use sound wave create picture organ soft tissue . This test measure size tissue thicknesses fat skeletal muscle . For procedure , ask raise shirt , disrobe waist , change hospital gown lie flat back examination table , sit chair , stand measure leg dimension . A gel spread ultrasound probe , probe apply directly skin arm , leg , abdomen . You feel slight pressure probe apply . The entire procedure take approximately 30 minute .</detailed_description>
