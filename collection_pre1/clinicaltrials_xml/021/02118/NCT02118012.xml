	<brief_summary>Background : - Hepatitis C liver disease cause hepatitis C virus . It common cause serious liver disease United States . Many people symptom . It lead cirrhosis , cause liver failure cancer . Researchers want study medicine call chlorcyclizine work patient hepatitis C. They want see used treat hepatitis C alone use standard hepatitis C treatment drug ribavirin . Objectives : - To see chlorcyclizine use treat hepatitis C alone combination drug ribavirin . Eligibility : - Adults chronic hepatitis C either never treat relapsed prior treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test , questionnaire . They also ultrasound abdomen electrocardiogram . Some test repeat throughout study . - Participants spend 3 day inpatient monitor start study drug . They assign randomly group begin take study drug . Blood take frequently . - Group I take study drug twice day 28 day . - Group II take study drug twice day ribavirin twice day 28 day . - Participants visit clinic every 7 day 28 day . - After participant stop take study drug , 5 follow-up visit 3 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety , Tolerability , Antiviral Activity Chlorcyclizine HCl Alone Combination With Ribavirin Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 50 patient chronic hepatitis C , treatment na ( SqrRoot ) relapsers interferon/ribavirin regimen enrol pilot study evaluate chlorcyclizine HCl without ribavirin ( RBV ) antiviral therapy . Adult patient ( great equal to18 year age ) evidence active chronic hepatitis C infection ( genotype ) detectable HCV RNA serum &gt; 10,000 IU/mL without contraindication chlorcyclizine HCl ribavirin evidence/history hepatic decompensation enrol . Patients monitor least two month regular test ALT HCV RNA quantitative level treatment undergo admission start therapy , include thorough medical evaluation time blood sampling . Patients randomize one two treatment group ; one chlorcyclizine HCl ( 75 mg twice daily ) RBV+ chlorcyclizine HCl ( 75 mg twice daily ) . For genotype , RBV dose base weight ( 1000 mg daily &lt; 75 kg 1200 mg daily great equal 75 kg ) . At clinic visit , patient question side effect symptom , undergo focused physical examination , blood take complete blood count , HCV RNA , PT/INR routine liver test ( ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase , direct total bilirubin , albumin ) . At end 28 day treatment , patient undergo repeat thorough medical evaluation inclusive complete physical exam , symptom scale evaluation , complete blood count , routine liver test , HCV serology panel . The primary endpoint therapy decline quantitative HCV RNA viral level 28 day treatment compare baseline viral titer group . Several secondary endpoint measure , include side effect therapy , ALT level , quantification chlorcyclizine HCl metabolites serum , quality life . Therapy stop intolerance RBV and/or chlorcyclizine HCl ( carefully define ) .</detailed_description>
