	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year ≤ 85 year . Subject documented diagnosis peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) classify Rutherford class 234 superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) and/or proximal popliteal artery ( PPA ) knee , locate arterial segment start least 1 cm beyond Common femoral artery ( CFA ) bifurcation superficial profunda femoris artery ( proximal anatomical landmark distal P1 segment popliteal artery level proximal edge patella ( distal anatomical landmark ) . Target lesion consist single de novo nonstented restenotic lesion ( tandem lesion ) combination lesion Reference vessel diameter ≥ 4 mm ≤ 7 mm visual estimate . Subject able walk without assistive device ( e.g . walker , cane ) . If subject ipsilateral/contralateral iliac disease require treatment index procedure Angiographic evidence adequate distal runoff foot ( least one native calf vessel [ posterior tibial , anterior tibial , peroneal artery ] patent , define &lt; 50 % diameter stenosis ) . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ≤ 7 day index procedure willing use reliable method birth control duration study must document adequate birth control . Signed dated Patient Informed Consent ( PIC ) form . Understands accepts duration study able willing comply requirement , include followup visit evaluation . Life expectancy , Investigator 's opinion , least 12 month . In investigator 's opinion subject unlikely comply followup schedule . Stroke STEMI within 3 month prior index procedure . Either local systemic thrombolytic therapy within 48 hour prior index procedure . Inability tolerate oral anticoagulation therapy ( blood thinner warfarin ) concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) . Known allergy sensitivity heparin , aspirin ( ASA ) , anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy , and/or paclitaxel allergy contrast medium adequately pretreated prior index procedure . Breastfeeding woman . Chronic renal insufficiency serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL within 14 day prior index procedure . WBC &lt; 3.0 ( 3,000 cells/mm3 ) within 14 day prior index procedure . PLT count &lt; 80,000 cells/mm3 &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3 within 14 day prior index procedure . Known suspect active systemic infection evidence WBC &gt; 14.0 ( 14000/mm3 ) within 14 day prior index procedure . Diagnosed bleeding diatheses hypercoagulable state . Subject enrol another investigational device , drug biologic study subject previously enrol IN.PACT SFA China trial . Any major ( e.g. , cardiac . peripheral , abdominal ) surgical procedure intervention perform within 30 day prior index procedure . Any major ( e.g. , cardiac . peripheral , abdominal ) elective procedure intervention within 30 day post index procedure . Contralateral SFA/PPA disease require treatment set index procedure . Presence additional lesion target vessel require treatment index procedure meet definition tandem lesion . Target lesion instent postDEB restenosis previously treat bypass surgery . Failure successfully cross target lesion guide wire Lesion within adjacent aneurysm . Acute subacute thrombus target vessel . Angiographic evidence severe calcification Target lesion know advance enrollment require treatment alternative therapy drugeluting stent ( DES ) , drugeluting balloon ( DEB ) , laser , atherectomy , cryoplasty , reentry device , cutting/scoring balloon , brachytherapy . Use embolic protection device also prohibit . Predilation result major ( ≥ Grade D ) flowlimiting dissection ( observed 2 orthogonal view ) residual stenosis &gt; 70 % translesional peak gradient &gt; 10mm Hg .</criteria>
