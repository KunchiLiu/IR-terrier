	<brief_summary>People poor insulin sensitivity respond normally elevation blood sugar . This may increase risk develop diabetes future . The purpose research study determine nutrient betaine , find beet , spinach wheat product , enhance production fetal growth factor 21 ( FGF21 ) , molecule believe promote insulin sensitivity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation Insulin Sensitivity Betaine Upregulation FGF21</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM : To determine betaine modulator FGF21 human . Low plasma betaine associate increase risk metabolic syndrome , mechanism modulate correlation poorly delineate . Betaine bioavailability human determine dietary intake genetic polymorphism influence betaine metabolism . Therefore , moderate betaine level could particularly beneficial individual . FGF21 elevate response insulin insensitivity active investigation therapeutic modality . The mechanisms action FGF21 betaine insulin sensitivity human incompletely understood . This study test hypothesis betaine induces FGF21 secretion insulin sensitize action human measure plasma FGF21 , betaine , choline ( betaine precursor ) , glucose , insulin adiponectin response betaine supplementation 24 hour time course 20 healthy , lean individual . This pilot nutrition intervention provide key preliminary evidence understand whether betaine exerts metabolic benefit human inform future study investigate novel betaine-FGF21-insulin sensitivity axis large cohort .</detailed_description>
