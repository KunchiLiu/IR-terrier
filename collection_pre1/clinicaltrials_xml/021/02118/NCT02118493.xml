	<brief_summary>The biliary system normally empty intestine , however , patient biliary system narrow area ( `` stenosis '' ) prevent bile drain normally . These may relate underlie disease previous surgery . Patients problem usually require tube insert biliary system drain bile bag outside body , impact quality life . The purpose research study use laser device try re-open biliary drainage system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current preferred minimally invasive treatment surgically related in-situ benign biliary stenosis ( BBS ) involve open surgical revision , endoscopic retrograde cholangiographic ( ERCP ) percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic ( PTC ) balloon angioplasty and/or stent/biliary catheter placement . Unfortunately , patient poor open surgical operative candidate . Although ERCP prefer secondary approach , anatomical restriction often require PTC . Additionally , previously place biliary stents/catheters poor long term patency require routine exchange every 3-6 month . The vast majority surgically related BBS patient non-operative candidate surgical revision BBS , favorable anatomy ERCP access . For patient fail aggressive PTC balloon angioplasty stenosis , treatment consist indefinite biliary catheter exchange every 3 month . Lifelong biliary catheter dependence severely impact quality life otherwise healthy patient additional evidence initial disease process . A potential long-term therapy alleviate BBS explore use laser excision fibrotic tissue responsible stenosis . Therapeutic application laser medicine novel concept . Its use well document urologic tract ablate tissue ( benign prostatic hypertrophy ) renal stone . Recent laser therapeutic use biliary tract dissolve gallstone describe . The laser excision BBS potential provide long term alleviation BBS . The primary endpoint feasibility study assess safety initial efficacy BBS laser excision .</detailed_description>
