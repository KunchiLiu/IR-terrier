	<brief_summary>Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer typically treat adjuvant endocrine therapy order decrease risk breast cancer recurrence improve overall survival disease . Typical agent use treatment include tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor . In postmenopausal woman , aromatase inhibitor therapy increasingly common associate few long-term serious toxicity compare tamoxifen . However , aromatase inhibitor cause arthralgias 40-50 % patient , influence adherence therapy lead treatment discontinuation minority case . The mechanism underlie development toxicity remain unclear , predictor develop symptom remain undefined . This observational study design collect patient-reported outcome serial serum sample order investigate potential etiology bothersome toxicity .</brief_summary>
