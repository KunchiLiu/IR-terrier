	<brief_title>The Impact Spinal Manipulation Leg Movement Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY : A non-surgical spine care clinician , ( physical therapist chiropractor ) principal investigator , rule , physical examination history , contraindication lumbar spinal manipulation ( SM ) prior intervention . The physical examination consist orthopedic test typically use clinical practice prior spinal manipulation intervention . No intervention deliver principal investigator . Upon arrival participant provide consent research assistants fill Research Participant Information Consent Form . They complete battery questionnaire base outcome measure include 2 quadruple numeric rating scale ( QNRS ) , one left , right leg pain , Swiss Spinal Stenosis score ( SSS ) ( Stucki , Daltroy , Liang et al 1996 ) Waterloo Footededness Questionnaire - revise ( WFQ-R ) ( Elias , Bryden , Bulman-Fleming 1998 ) computer . The width length distal pad great toe measure bilaterally . Apparatus : A 23 '' project image position lengthwise front participant surface , parallel floor face ceiling , custom build support frame platform . A microswitch mount support frame platform edge proximal participant serve home position . Custom software ( E-prime , v 2.0 Psychology Software Tools Inc. , Sharpsburg , PA ) use generate project image , track switch initiate timing , trigger/synchronize 3-dimensional movement record . An infrared emitting diode ( IRED ) , ( Northern Digital , Waterloo , ON ) mount distal aspect great toe use custom removable brace . Procedure : With bare foot participant stand platform great toe pad depress microswitch identify `` home '' key . A visual precue ( black cross center project image ) alert participant next trial begin variable time ( 2000-2550 m ) precue . They ask reach forward ( sagittal plane ) great toe pad touch center target generate computer touch screen `` quickly accurately possible '' . These discrete foot aim movement . Targets appear screen 's surface widths either 2.5 cm , 5 cm require movement amplitudes 20 cm , 50 cm contact . The combination distance , target width use determine index difficulty task . Each 4 possible combination use generate 4 different index difficulty ( ID ) 3a , 4a , 4b , 5 bit ( IDs 4a , 4b overlap consist different target width/distance combination ) . The 4 combination present random order , combination present 10 time , total 40 trial . Once complete one foot procedure repeat opposite foot , result total 80 trial . To reduce risk potential fall , participant wear gait belt ( Ross Flexi Belt ) rail adjacent platform . Participants allow sit rest foot need . Each round trials require less 10 minute perform . The order foot use randomly assign . The touch surface , toe mount IRED , platform surface disinfect participant . Participants active lumbar range-of-motion ( ROM ) quantify use electrogoniometry/torsiometry ( Biometrics Ltd , Ladysmith , VA ) randomize either SM NI group . Based group assignment respectively either receive either bilateral high-velocity low-amplitude ( HVLA ) SM direct toward lumbar region license clinician , wait 5 minute non-intervention . The HVLA lumbar SM procedure deliver hypothenar spinous pull ( Peterson , Bergman , 2002 ) . The presence absence audible joint cavitation follow SM anecdotally record . The NI group keep blind whether may receive SM later study . All participant active lumbar range motion reassess immediately follow intervention ( NI ) , NRS low back leg pain repeat , perform additional 80 trial foot point task ( experimenter blind intervention participant receive ) . Statistical Tests : Separate pair student 's t-tests use compare participant term leave right baseline QNRS score , NRS score pre post intervention , lumbar ROM axis movement pre post intervention . Separate unpaired student 's t-tests compare questionnaire base outcome measure score group , lumbar ROM axis movement pre post intervention group . For behavioural kinematic measure separate 2 Group ( SM , NI ) x 2 Limb ( leave , right ) x 4 ID mixed model analysis variance ( ANOVA ) design employ . Post hoc analysis perform effect involve two mean need use Tukey 's Honestly Significant Difference ( HSD ) . Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events : As study require clinical intervention , follow adverse event could possible : post-treatment soreness and/or exacerbation exist low back symptom . Such event may may occur follow spinal manipulation . Planned Dissemination : The result study prepared dissemination first relevant clinical scientific conference . Subsequently , work submit peer review journal consideration publication . Additional Ethical Aspects Protocol : Potential Benefits Participants Others : The potential benefit participation participant include receive $ 10 parking reimbursement , $ 5 Tim Hortons gift card . The patient may increase range motion decrease low back pain result clinical intervention . The information learn study benefit others lumbar spinal stenosis future . Indirect benefit include knowledge contribute advancement scientific understand effect spinal manipulation measurement movement outcomes population LSS . There direct benefit others . Indirect benefit include scientific community plan dissemination work . The result study prepared dissemination first relevant clinical scientific conference . Participants option ( mandatory ) provide email address consent form wish know outcome study . Subsequently , work submit peer review journal consideration publication . Potential harm Participants Others : The stenosis population could possibly experience fatigue discomfort relate pre-existing leg low back pain . In attempt minimize event trial duration keep brief participant allow sit rest trial need . As study require clinical intervention , follow adverse event could possible : post-treatment soreness and/or exacerbation exist low back symptom . Such event may may occur follow spinal manipulation . A licensed clinician five year experience hand . To protect participant privacy data collect cod put database format . All data de-identified keep single study computer site password protect locate locked office . As , access study subject information/data highly safeguard accessed Dr. Passmore . Any paper form questionnaires kept locked cabinet lock room . Identifying information collect subject 's name , contact information date birth .</detailed_description>
