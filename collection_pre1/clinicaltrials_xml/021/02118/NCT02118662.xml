	<brief_title>Energy Expenditure During Seated , Seated Cycling , Treadmill Walking Work Conditions ( EE-Work )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The anthropometrics measure first . The height body weight collect clinic staff clinic . The metabolic testing condition take place real office setting . The participant fit heart rate monitor fasten around chest use elastic strap . They also fit portable metabolic system ( COSMED ) . This unit fit around waist back , much like backpack . The unit attach face mask fit mouth nose secure elastic strap wrap around head . The participant first rest motionless chair 20 minute . Following , complete three different simulate work condition type computer 1 ) seat office chair , 2 ) seat pedal use prototype pedal desk , 3 ) walking treadmill . The order test seat pedal treadmill walk work condition counterbalance participant randomly assign two possible order permutation . They complete 3 work condition 15 minute self-selected level effort . A rest period 5 minute give condition . During work condition , ask retype displayed standard set text .</detailed_description>
