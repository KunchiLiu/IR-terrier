	<brief_summary>Background : The optimal duration dual antiplatelet therapy ACS patient treat DES still debate . This especially true STEMI patient era new anticoagulant antiplatelet agent . Yet , potential benefit longterm dual antiplatelet therapy avoid thrombotic complication may clearly counterbalance high risk major bleed complication . In particular , COMBO dual therapy stent , associate early re-endothelization , may allow reduction duration DAPT ( dual anti plateled therapy ) without increase thrombotic risk , reduce risk severe bleed complication . Study Objective : Aim current study demonstrate non-inferiority strategy short-term DAPT ( 90 day ) compare standard 360 day DAPT ACS patient treat Combo stent . Study Design : This study prospective , multicenter , randomize , investigator-initiated study design enroll 1500 patient ACS receive COMBO dual-therapy stent randomize 1:1 either short term ( 90 day ) standard ( 360 day ) DAPT . Patients randomize within hospitalization ( discharge case additional revascularization deem necessary performed hospitalization ) . Clinical visit schedule 90 , 360 day , whereas telephone contact perform 180 720 day . Patient Population : The study population consist 1500 ACS patient ( male female ) old 18 year amenable percutaneous treatment treat COMBO stent . Subjects must meet eligibility criterion provide write informed consent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study site : Up 40 investigational site Europe Asia Patients follow-up : Follow-up ( clinic ) visit schedule 90 360 day , whereas telephone contact perform 180 720 day . Patients randomize short-term DAPT continue monotherapy ASA 90 day unless contraindicate . Antiplatelet therapy : Subjects treat Aspirin P2Y12 inhibitor . Prasugrel ( 10 mg/day ) Ticagrelor ( 180 mg/day ) strongly recommend compare Clopidogrel ( 75 mg/day ) ) . Long term DAPT arm : continue DAPT P2Y12 inhibitor ASA 360 day , patient continue monotherapy ASA , unless contraindication ASA emerge Short term DAPT arm : continue DAPT P2Y12 inhibitor ASA 90 day , patient continue . Timelines : Initial Enrollment : March 2014 , Last Enrollment : May 2016 , One year Follow-up : May 2018 , Two year Follow-up : May 2019</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must â‰¥18 year age 2 . The patient diagnose STEMI , NSTEMI UA 3 . The Patient willing comply specify followup evaluation 4 . The Patient inform nature study , agree provision provide write informed consent , approve appropriate Medical Ethics Committee ( MEC ) , Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) , Human Research Ethics Committee ( HREC ) 5 . Successful COMBO stent implantation ( TIMI 3 flow residual stenosis &lt; 20 % base visual estimation ) , clinical adverse event hospitalization ( Death , ST , stroke , TVR , bleeding ( BARC II , III , V ) ) 1 . Patients present cardiogenic shock 2 . Patients recent major bleed complication contraindication DAPT , : 1 . Hypersensitivity Aspirin , Clopidogrel , Prasugrel Ticagrelor 2 . Need oral anticoagulation 3 . History bleed diathesis know coagulopathy ( include heparininduced thrombocytopenia ) refusal blood transfusion 4 . History intracerebral mass , aneurysm , arteriovenous malformation , hemorrhagic stroke 5 . Stroke transient ischemic attack within past 6 month permanent residual neurologic defect 6 . Gastrointestinal genitourinary bleeding within last 2 month major surgery within 6 week 7 . Recent history know current platelet count &lt; 100 000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL 8 . An elective surgical procedure plan would necessitate interruption thienopyridines first 12 month post enrollment 3 . Planned need concomitant cardiac surgery ( e.g. , valve surgery resection aortic leave ventricular aneurysm etc . ) 4 . Planned intervention another lesion ( target vessel nontarget vessel ) index hospital discharge 5 . Any revascularization perform within index hospitalization stent COMBO 6 . Potential noncompliance towards requirement trial protocol ( especially medical treatment ) followup visit 7 . Patients require permanent DAPT due comorbidities 8 . Patient receive organ transplant wait list organ transplant 9 . Life expectancy le 2 year 10 . Pregnancy intention become pregnant course trial 11 . Any significant medical mental condition , Investigator 's opinion may interfere patient 's optimal participation study 12 . Currently participate another investigational drug device study 13 .
