	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) percutaneous carotid angioplasty stenting ( CAS ) affect memory think result improve worsen think memory . There many study subject , find certain patient gain improvement brain function others might get bad . The goal study discover patient likely improved cognitive functioning . Carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) percutaneous carotid angioplasty stenting ( CAS ) investigational accept treatment condition . In addition , subject choose undergo surgery also include study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cognitive Outcome After Carotid Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present time , large multi-center clinical trial support use carotid revascularization symptomatic carotid stenosis asymptomatic carotid stenosis ( great 60 % ) prevent stroke . Guidelines support use carotid endarterectomy asymptomatic stenosis base largely Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study ( ACAS ) report 47 % relative risk reduction ipsilateral stroke death patient randomize surgery compare best medical management 5 year . These data substantiate recent publication Medical Research Council Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery ( ACST ) trial result ( 1 ) ; however , trial estimate least 40 operative procedure require prevent single disable stroke death one patient 5 year ( 2 ) . These data underscore importance understanding cognitive risk carotid revascularization develop strategy limit factor contribute risk especially asymptomatic patient . The purpose study well understand effect carotid revascularization ( use either carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) percutaneous carotid angioplasty stenting ( CAS ) ) cognitive outcome prospectively collect cerebral blood flow data cognitive testing data prior carotid revascularization procedure .</detailed_description>
	<mesh_term>Carotid Stenosis</mesh_term>
	<criteria>Patients asymptomatic ( define symptom past 6 month ) carotid stenosis Patients hemodynamically significant carotid artery stenosis ( accord CREST criterion : ≥ 60 % angiography , OR ≥ 70 % ultrasound , OR ≥ 80 % CTA MRA ) Patients prior large vessel infarct Patients intracranial stenosis Patients major depression Patients Alzheimer disease ( clinically define Wechsler IQ &lt; 80 ) Patients previous ipsilateral carotid surgery Patients baseline dementia define : MiniMental Status Examination score &lt; 21 OR MiniMental score ≥21 AND Baseline HVLT score 3 standard deviation normal FAS score 2 standard deviation normal OR clinical symptom evident direct cognitive assessment ( e.g . sundowning , get lose driving ) . Note : A control group would comprise 15 patient meet eligibility criterion , elect condition follow rather undergo revascularization .</criteria>
