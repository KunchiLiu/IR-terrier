	<brief_title>Antiretroviral Adherence Quality-of-life Support HIV+ Patients India With Twice-daily Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) Calls With Health Mental Health Messaging Compared Weekly IVR Survey Only Control Condition : The Mobile-messaging Adherence Support Health Study , India .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The originally propose study aim revise slightly review process Indian Council Medical Research ( ICMR ) , NIH equivalent partner funder research ( see `` ICMR Comments '' document ) . The original proposal examine comprehensive messaging adherence , risk reduction , quality life ( i.e. , emotional support ) , compare medication adherence message . The protocol revise compare comprehensive message standard care . The IVR intervention build Dimagi 's original ART adherence text-messaging support system call `` ARemind '' . Therefore , aim study : 1 . Adapt ARemind mobile phone ART adherence mobile phone message system PLH Kolkata , India ; 2 . Further develop ARemind address co-occurring factor ART non-adherence , poor mental health , transmission risk ; 3 . Examine acceptability , engagement , adherence PLH IVR message system ; 4 . Examine efficacy twice daily ART reminder call health message compare standard care , medication adherence compare standard care improve adherence mental health , reduce transmission risk , randomize control trial . BACKGROUND The 2.3 million person live HIV ( PLH ) India offer access anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) government . ART offer possibility improve health reduce HIV transmission decrease HIV viral load PLH . Yet , non-adherence remains high globally , estimate 50 % PLH India maintain adherence 95 % ART dose , consider adherence rate need maintain HIV viral suppression . Mobile phone use US globally increase ART adherence among PLH . As low cost , easily diffuse intervention strategy country India mobile phone penetration rate expect reach 100 % 2014 ( Informa World , 2010 ) , design mobile phone intervention increase ART adherence potentially highly efficacious intervention . However , HIV chronic infectious disease , PLH also challenge maintain mental health reduce transmission risk ( Swendeman et al. , 2009a ) . Furthermore , review meta-analyses conclude ART adherence intervention effective comprehensive approach adopt ( Malta , 2008 ; Rueda , 2006 ; Simoni , 2006 ) . In particular , mental health symptom transmission act co-occur undermine ART adherence ( Kalichman , 2008 , Malta , 2008 ) likely behavior may also influence mobile phone deliver intervention . Thus , study aim adapt develop intervention improve maintain medication appointment adherence , reduce transmission act , improve quality life include mental health symptom . Phase 1 pilot testing ( June - August , 2013 ) recently complete research team Kolkata PLH ( n=46 ) take ART client Durbar 's Mamata Care Treatment Center ( MCTC ) , member Durbar 's `` Mamata Network Positive Women '' ( MNPW ) , peer . Phase 1 involved 1-month pilot test IVR messaging intervention , include baseline follow assessment , brief open-ended feedback interview focus group feedback interview follow inform current protocol . Three world-renowned HIV prevention technology organization collaborate Phase 2 research activity : 1 ) UCLA Center HIV Identification , Prevention , Treatment Services ( CHIPTS ) , expertise behavioral intervention development , adaptation , randomize trial PLH high-risk population ; 2 ) Durbar , expertise multi-level prevention support service high-risk population India ; 3 ) Dimagi Inc. , technology company expertise mobile phone solution global health challenge . Dimagi develop `` ARemind '' ass remind ART appointment adherence feedback PLH provider U.S. test pilot study prior NIH-funded grant . The software remind PLH text-messaging ( i.e . Simple Messaging Service [ SMS ] ) Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) method . This program also leverage address co-morbid challenge prevent transmission improve mental health quality life PLH . In study , ARemind adapt developed PLH recruit two site Kolkata , India ; 1 ) community base care treatment center operate Durbar serve primarily female sex worker live HIV ( i.e. , Mamata Care &amp; Treatment Center [ MCTC ] &amp; Mamata Network Positive Women [ MNPW ] ) , 2 ) PLH recruit primary ART Centre Calcutta School Tropical Medicine ( STM ) . DESIGN AND METHODS After recruitment consent Phase 2 , participant randomize within site gender sub-samples either intervention standard care ( control ) condition complete Phase 2 Baseline Survey . Participants personal mobile phone provide mobile phone phone line ( i.e. , Sim card ) service pay research team 6-month study period . All participant complete in-person follow interview ( research team member ) every two month six month , include medical record abstraction , brief weekly IVR assessment ( , via mobile phone ) . Study document IVR message available Bengali Hindi . RECRUITMENT The source referral MCTC staff client MNPW network member peer ( Phase 2A ) , STM ART Centre staff , patient peer ( Phase 2B ) . Staff , patient , client sit recruitment script administer member research team provide study information card give patient , client , peer think may interested participate research study . If patient , client peer interested finding study , contact research team directly use phone number study information card . A member Durbar MCTC Staff ( Phase 2A ) STM Staff ( Phase 2B ) administer verbal introduction script patient wait area MCTC STM . MCTC client flow modest , see less dozen PLH day . STM patient flow see hundred 1st-line ART patient day , long line wait time see physician , lab technician , counselor , receive ART refill . The introduction script tell patients/clients recruiter part research study . Next research team member describe study people sit wait area . If potential participant interested hearing team member , go private office within MCTC ( Durbar office - Phase 2A ) STM ( Study office provide STM - Phase 2B ) research team member administer screen question . SCREENING [ In-Person ] If patient , client , peer interested find s/he eligible participate base ( introductory ) recruitment script , research team member privately administer screen question . If eligible base self-report , eligibility confirm study staff review potential participant 's ART Card . Responses record Dimagi phone application study staff . [ By Telephone ] If caller interested find s/he eligible participate base ( introductory ) recruitment script , research team member administer screen question . If potential participant eligible base self-report , in-person meeting schedule MCTC STM study office . The screening question re-administered in-person meeting , confirm review ART Card , responses record Dimagi phone application study staff . Durbar Staff screen potential participant private room private area School Tropical Medicine MCTC Durbar . Self-report potential participant follow information determine preliminary eligibility : 1 ) Age ; 2 ) long ART ; 3 ) ART regimen ( 1st , 2nd , 3rd line ) ; 4 ) receive CD4 count result past two month ( Phase 2A MCTC/MNPW ) past 2 month ( Phase 2B STM ) ; 4 ) miss take ART dose past 6 month . If eligible base self-report , verbal consent obtain review potential participant 's ART Card confirm eligibility checking : 1 ) identity photo , 2 ) Age , 3 ) long ART , 4 ) ART regimen ( 1st , 2nd ) , 5 ) date last CD4 count result . All screen information except identity ( photo , name ) also include gender , language , literacy ( literate ) record Screening Questionnaire order compare ineligibles , consent participate , consent participant . Screening data enter secure database Dimagi system use study staff mobile phone Dimagi application . CONSENT &amp; ENROLLMENT If recruitment/screening in-person , eligible participant ask want enroll study time . If , research team member administer Informed Consent Form . If recruitment/screening telephone , research team member make in-person appointment eligible participant repeat screening , confirm eligibility base ART Card review , administer Informed Consent Form , eligible participant want enroll study . BASELINE AND FOLLOW UP SURVEY INTERVIEWS Study interviewer use mobile phone survey application program Dimagi administer baseline follow-up survey participant record responses . The Baseline Follow-Up interview 2- , 4- , 6-months generally schedule day medical visit STM ART Centre , shortly ART Centre visit participant recruit MCTC/MNPW . ART MEDICAL CARD ABSTRACTION All ART patient India keep medical record carry monthly appointment check-ups medication refill . The `` ART Card '' include patient 's name , photo , date birth , address , phone number , contact name phone number , information relate HIV treatment outcome , include CD4 cell count ( conduct every 6 month ) ART pill count ( i.e. , estimate adherence ) collect monthly clinic visit . ( The STM ART clinic also keep copy record ) . During Screening Baseline Follow-Up survey ART Card review study interviewer confirm participant 's identity eligibility , record participant 's CD4 ART pill count date survey application . At Baseline , prior two CD4 prior 6 ART pill count record . At follow-up interview prior two pill count new CD4 count record . WEEKLY IVR ASSESSMENT CALLS All participant receive one IVR Assessment call week consist four question , one medication adherence , two depressive symptom , one physical symptom . Responses enter press 1 ( yes ) 2 ( ) phone keypad . Once response receive , next question play . If IVR assessment call answer , system attempt 3 repeat call within one hour specify call time . If participant respond 2 consecutive week ' IVR assessment call , study interviewer call participant 's phone ( contact , need ) confirm mobile phone service still active remind participant IVR system function . Participants select day time receive IVR assessment call , confirm change follow interview change call study contact number . If participant request , decline receive IVR assessment call . Female participant receive call female voice vice versa male participant . Feedback PLH CAB , service provider , another similar study India , Phase 1 experience find read technological literacy low enough among PLH interactive feature may prove unreliable . Therefore , participant receive brief training study interviewer baseline meeting IVR assessment call function respond use keypad . INTERVENTION : IVR MESSAGING SYSTEM The IVR messaging system automatically send pre-recorded voice message twice day , morning evening , participant intervention condition . The call time link time participant report typically take his/her ART medication ( twice day standard dose schedule 1st-line ART ) alternative time participant specifies Baseline Follow-Up Surveys . The basic function call act `` alarm reminder '' take ART , whether call answer , message content dual function engage participant potentially impact study outcome beyond ART adherence . Messaging automatically stop 6-month follow complete participant decline receive message withdraw study . The IVR intervention message le 60 second focus several key domain identify important engage target population intervention team : 1 ) Illness-related information ( i.e. , TB , malaria , HIV-specific message ) self-management strategy medication adherence symptom/side-effect management ( nausea , diarrhea , dehydration ) ; 2 ) Wellness-related message focus primarily diet , nutrition , hygiene ; 3 ) Mental health relate message focus self-management strategy stress-reduction , mood improvement , positive cognition , social support . Not message content evaluated corresponding outcome measure . Specifically , change knowledge assess order reduce assessment burden focus behavioral outcome . The functional role message intend engagement , intervention framing , motivation , addition behavioral cue . Over 120 message develop , split evenly across three category illness , health , mental health message . Messages randomly sort within category sequence alternate order final message delivery queue . The number message select message repeat two month . HIV &amp; STI `` Specific '' Messages Phase 1 result identified PLH prefer specific message HIV/AIDS risk behavior , others , particularly child , prefer general health message protect privacy event someone else answer phone call . Therefore , Baseline 2-month follow-up assessment , participant receive message specifically mention HIV/AIDS sexual behavior sexually transmit infection ( STI ) , refer `` Specific '' message . Specific message intentionally implement Baseline 2-month follow allow participant actually experience intervention modality opt receive specific message might result adverse event HIV disclosure . At 2-month 4-month follow-up interview participant `` opt-in '' receive `` Specific '' message follow two month , message preference record survey application automatically link Dimagi message system . Specific message library currently prepare . Participants Intervention Condition able opt-out receive specific ( i.e . HIV-related ) IVR message time call study team . ART Clinic Appointment Reminders The IVR messaging system also send ART clinic appointment reminder ART Centre visit schedule 8-weeks ( 2-months ) baseline , 2-month , 4-month follow-up interview , specific date provide participant . ART Centre follow-up visit typically schedule exactly four week apart . The appointment reminder send morning call 7 day advance appointment 2 day advance . If appointment reminder call answer , system attempt 3 repeat call within one hour specify call time repeat subsequent specify call time answered day schedule appointment . `` National Do Not Call '' ( NDNC ) Registry : India `` National Do Not Call '' ( NDNC ) registry cell phone number `` opt-in '' registry . In order put NDNC registry , cell phone owner must contact registry cell phone number add . Once add , NDNC registry prevents cell phone receive `` robo-calls '' - typically commercial solicitation . Since study 's `` IVR Messaging System '' `` Weekly Assessment Calls '' technically `` robo-calls , '' participant ( use cell phone ) must register NDNC registry order participate study . If participant previously register NDNC registry , get permission participant assi ist remove cell phone number NDNC registry duration study . At study completion , request , researcher assist participant opt-in NDNC registry . Message Monitoring Follow Up The IVR system also monitor report Dimagi system study team whether call answer duration call estimate whether listen completely . Message monitoring report generate weekly basis . If report indicate call answer participant two consecutive week phone number specify , study team member call participant 's phone ( contact , need ) confirm service still active obtain new preferred phone number participant ( see Phone Follow-Up Script ) . TIME FOR ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES Total study time 6.5 hour control group 12.5 hour intervention group . The Baseline Interview , include informed consent instruction , last 2 hour . The three Follow-up Interviews last 1 hour . IVR Assessment message require 3 minute participant listen respond message week 6 month ( 1.5 hour ) . Intervention message require 2 minute per day x 6 month ( 6 hour ) . DATA MANAGEMENT All data cod unique participant identification number ( PID ) generate computerized algorithm participant 's name , father 's name , age , sex , phone number collect `` Registration Information '' section baseline interview . The interview conduct computerized assessment use mobile phone program Dimagi Inc. , data store HIPAA compliant server United States . The `` Registration Information , '' include locator information ( i.e. , phone number alternate contact phone number ) , store separate file interview data Dimagi server , different password-protected access control accessible PI &amp; research team member . The `` Registration Information '' question repeat follow interview verify participant 's identity study participant . Only study staff access `` Registration Information '' via study specific mobile phone instal assessment application Dimagi , phone password protect Dimagi application also login ID password . Signed consent form store lock file lock office Durbar research office . All form record data study electronic manage Dimagi : 1 ) Screener data , 2 ) Locator Form ( i.e . `` Registration Form '' ) , 3 ) Baseline Follow-up survey data , 4 ) IVR assessment data . At completion study , data download UCLA research team permanently delete Dimagi server . DATA ANALYSES Baseline descriptive analysis conduct simple frequency distribution method ( mean , mode , range , standard deviation ) . Follow-up data examine linear logistic regression . Unadjusted adjusted longitudinal analysis conduct random coefficient model , specific subset general multilevel modeling framework . Statistical analysis conduct SAS computer program . The sample size support statistical power detect response intervention ( i.e. , effect size ) mean change 0.40 baseline follow-up . RISKS Risks participate Baseline , Follow-Up , focus group interview minimal . Participants could experience discomfort provide response question regard frequency sexual behavior alcohol use , experience HIV-related stigma , discrimination support . Participants tell answer eligibility question discuss topic focus group entirely voluntary may decide answer question time . Steps take ensure anonymity participant 's self-disclosed age , sexual behavior , substance use determine eligibility . All screening question ask private setting . There also risk bystander could overhear IVR message someone else could answer participant phone hear IVR message , might result question participant nature purpose message . However , IVR message common India , provide common explanation participant . Furthermore , participant know IVR call expect choose time receive call turn phone ignore call concern privacy time . HIV-status disclosure happen participant chooses disclose response question bystander . `` National Do Not Call '' registry - There risk participant remove cell phone number registry duration study . The risk gather information properly train supervised staff pose minimal risk propose participant . Some participant may benefit interaction attentive train professional feel good give chance express opinion . Project staff member train offer referral appropriate resource end interview participant hear response indicate ( observe ) participant need service otherwise receive .</detailed_description>
