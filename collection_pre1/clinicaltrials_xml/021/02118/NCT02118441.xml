	<brief_summary>When patient undergoes heart surgery , Anesthesiologist insert tiny plastic tube , call catheter , artery patient 's wrist . This call radial artery catheter . A radial artery catheter allow accurate measurement patient 's blood pressure surgery . There two common technique place radial artery catheter . The first `` blind '' technique whereby Anesthesiologist feel pulse patient 's wrist place catheter use location pulse guide . The second technique , less commonly use , one whereby Anesthesiologist use ultrasound machine ( painless patient ) `` see '' artery , thereby use ultrasound guide catheter placement . Our study test hypothesis ultrasound-guided radial artery catheterization faster insertion time , few complication compare palpation-guided insertion .</brief_summary>
