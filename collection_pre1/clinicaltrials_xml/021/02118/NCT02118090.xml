	<brief_summary>The investigator propose leverage unique infrastructure expertise National Centre Parasitology Entomology Malaria Control Pasteur Institute Cambodia combine modern fieldwork , include mobile laboratory fully equip molecular biology culture experiment , state-of-the-art genomic analysis investigate Plasmodium vivax parasites respond antimalarial drug . The investigator focus resistance CQ , choice treatment vivax malaria endemic country , treatment failure report Cambodia . The study address key biological mechanism limit efficiency drug therapy P. vivax , include identification genetic polymorphism underlie drug resistance Cambodian P. vivax . The finding provide first unbiased perspective mechanism drug resistance P. vivax strong potential significantly improve malaria control Southeast Asia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order ass resistance phenotype P. vivax CQ , methodology involve follow step : 1 . Inclusion P.vivax mono-infected patient village treatment failure-reported area ( Ban Lung district , Rattanakiri ) 2 . Pv diagnostic confirmation ( microscopy qPCR ) 3 . Transfer patient Ban Lung hospital 7-days clinical follow-up 4 . Blood collection follow CQ administration 5 . Parasite clearance whole blood CQ concentration follow-up 7 day . 6 . Parasitemia follow-up 2 month patient stay Ban Lung entire study make sure re-infection occurs ( Ban Lung no-transmission area ) . 7 . Ex vivo drug susceptibility assay P. vivax isolate recrudescence/relapse , . 8 . Genotyping analysis parasite Day 0 recrudescence/relapse , . Research design The study carry Ban Lung district ( Rattanakir province , Cambodia ) April 2014 December 2014 . This research site ( Rattanakiri ) choose basis relatively high report treatment failure CQ . In Ban Lung district village , P. vivax mono-infected adult patient seek treatment community level ( VMW Health center ) offer participate study The sample size calculation base address primary objective identifying true resistance phenotype CQ . Therefore minimum 50 patient require ideally , around 100 patient increase probability detect resistant parasite . All eligible participant approach study staff information objective study explain . Informed consent obtain participant inclusion . All P. vivax mono-infected patient identify study site include . Staff involve research study compose scientist technician CNM IPC . Additional collaborator ( Reference hospital , Health center VMW staff ion Rattanakiri province ) involve project . Villages Ban Lung district P. vivax transmission occur select . Patients seek treatment village ( VMW Health canter ) test malaria infection RDT non-P. falciparum infect patient offer participate study . Falciparum malaria case manage VMW Health center usually accord Cambodian National guideline After obtain informed consent , patient enrol study two group constitute : 1. control group patient stay village 2. group transfer Banlung hospital . Then , 3 x 5ml-ACD tube venous blood collect prior give CQ patient . For control group , parasitemia follow Day3 , D7 , D14 , D28 D42 D49 , D56 D60 accord WHO protocol , use fingerprick-collected blood . For study group , patient follow fingerprick parasite clearance CQ concentration measure every 8h least 3 day complete parasite clearance ( determine two consecutive negative result microscopy qPCR ) . Parasitemia CQ concentration determine daily use fingerprick 7 day . To make sure patient re-infected , stay Ban Lung accommodation 2 month every 48h fingerpricks detect increase parasitemia study , control group stay village re-infection occur . If recrudescence observe , patient re-admitted Ban Lung hospital protocol perform . Ex vivo drug sensitivity assay P. vivax isolate perform either directly blood sample cryopreservation . In case , assay involve invasion freshly add reticulocyte P. vivax isolates . The reticulocyte use work obtain cord blood acquire gynecology/obstetric department Calmette hospital ( Pr Kruy Leang Sim ) , accord agreement IPC Calmette hospital . Cord blood supply regularly IPC , three time week , 5 7 ml per ACD-tube , 5 tube per day , number birth allow sample . ABO blood group , hemoglobin electrophoresis , G6PD enzyme activity Duffy status blood determine use reticulocyte P. vivax invasion culture . Data enter process use Microsoft Excel . Parasitemia directly correlate CQ concentration blood allow categorize parasite accord slope clearance time sensitivity CQ . Statistical analysis perform require detect significant effect .</detailed_description>
