	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia devastate complex illness , multiple symptom behavioral manifestation . Antipsychotic medication mainstay treatment ; however , many patient partially respond treatment . Development new treatment progress rapidly , part , underlie etiopathophysiology illness well understood . To date , pharmacological treatment approve use schizophrenia involve primary modulation dopamine system . Many agent without dopamine action fail demonstrate efficacy . There grow evidence schizophrenia may , part , due inflammatory process pharmacological treatment approach decrease inflammation show promise . Thus , treatment may anti-inflammatory property ( e.g. , TNF-alpha inhibition ) , also possess dopamine modulation may prove beneficial . This novel medication , l-tetrahydropalmatine ( l-THP ) , robust anti-inflammatory property , particularly TNF-alpha ICAM inhibition ; antiprotozoal activity ; possess antipsychotic-like pharmacological profile D1 , D2 D3 receptor antagonism . The high affinity l-THP D1 versus D2 receptor distinguishes first generation antipsychotic D1 D2 ratio resembles superior antipsychotic , clozapine . Also , almost identical compound , l-stepholindine ( l-SPD ) , demonstrate robust antipsychotic activity human ( positive negative symptom ) currently use clinically China . l-THP use 40 year clinically China , good safety profile date , represent novel excite mechanism schizophrenia treatment . Initial safety data phase I study l-THP ( 20 healthy control ) show excellent tolerability lack substantial side effect . L-THP tested outpatient drug abuse trial 4 week good safety data , ( Hu et al 2006 , Yang et al 2003 ) . Yang et al ( 2003 ) randomize medication 120 participant 4 week 4 week observation without notable side effect . We test compound ( 30 mg BID ) adjunct treatment randomize , double-blind , 4-week trial , assess treatment efficacy , change peripheral cytokine concentration , , secondarily , antiprotozoal effect , ( antibody titer Toxoplasma gondii ) , infection know occur high rate schizophrenia healthy control may relate part illness .</brief_summary>
