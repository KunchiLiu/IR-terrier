	<brief_summary>Robotic-assisted surgery become prominent within specialty Gynecologic surgery little direct evidence well traditional laparoscopic surgery , least equivalent . We design randomized-controlled trial compare operative time , length hospital stay , estimate blood loss , post-operative complication associate two method minimally invasive hysterectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Conventional Laparoscopic Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study non-blinded randomize control trial . Patients randomize group Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy ( Group # 1 ) Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Hysterectomy ( Group # 2 ) use random number generator . Data collection occur follow point patient interaction : pre-operative appointment , surgical procedure , patient 's hospitalization , first post-operative appointment , final post-operative appointment . The care patient enrol study deviate standard care patient currently undergo laparoscopic robot-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy . The patient present office pre-operative history physical examination laparoscopic hysterectomy counsel participation study . Basic data collection commence pre-operative visiting , include : patient demographic , past medical history , past surgical history , physical exam finding , image result . The pre-operative appointment occur one thirty day prior surgery . Intra-operative immediate post-operative data collect surgical assistant ( resident fellow ) include surgical procedure ( conventional laparoscopic robot-assisted ) , operative time , hematocrit , estimate blood loss , length stay , complication .</detailed_description>
