	<brief_title>Does Sugared Sugar Free Chewing Gum Reduces Postoperative Ileus After Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy consider gold standard gall stone disease . Postoperative ileus abdominal surgery common complication , consider physiological response main cause postoperative abdominal pain , discomfort increase duration hospital stay . Postoperative ileus ( POI ) may last 5 day uncomplicated abdominal surgery . Activity small intestine return within 24 hour stomach large intestine take 36 72 hour regain motility.3 The use early feeding , medication like cisapride etc . use reduced POI none significantly useful research work . Gum chew abdominal surgery reduces duration POI , pain discomfort . Gum chew also reduce halitosis , dental caries , elevate mood reduces stress additional benefit . Many study prove chew gum placebo effect surgery adult child . Sugar-free chewing gum focus mainly study . Perioperative role glucose intake show many benefit like reduce insulin resistance . In study investigator want evaluate role chew gum reduce POI laparoscopic cholecystectomy exploration see whether chew gum beneficial , sugar-free sugar . If study prove beneficial effect chew gum investigator well management patient postoperatively sugar chew gum readily available inexpensive . After meet inclusion exclusion criterion , All patient give Tab . Midazolam 7.5 mg PO night surgery receive standard general anesthesia endotracheal intubation . Inj . Midazolam IV 0.7 mg/kg give 45 min surgery premedication . Anesthesia induce propofol ( 2.5 mg/kg ) 3 minute preoxygenation . Muscle relaxation achieve atracuium ( 0.5 mg/kg ) . Anesthesia maintain sevoflurane ( 2.5 vol % ) oxygen air mixture ( 0.50 ratio ) . Ventilation control mechanically end tidal normocapnia maintain keep pCO2 35-38 mmHg . Following medication give patient process . - Inj . Cefuroxime 1.5 gm . IV ( 2 dos , 1st dose 30-60 min surgery 2nd dose 6 hour surgery ) - Inj . Ketorolac 30mg IV ( 3 dos total , 1st dose immediate postop , 2nd 3rd 8 16 hour surgery respectively ) - Inj . Zantac 50 mg IV ( 2 dos total , 1st immediate postop 2nd 12 hour surgery ) All patient operate consultant surgeon . Duration surgery note . Patients divide randomly 3 group equally ; end contain 30 patient . Group A control group , group B receive sugar-free chewing gum ( Orbit ) group C receive sugared chewing gum ( Dingdong chew gum hilalcandy ) . Both B C group ask start chew gum 4 hour surgery continue 8 hourly ( 20-25 minute time ) oral feeding start . Onset hunger , bowel movement , flatus pass defecation note . Bowel movement examine via stethoscope hourly surgery . All patient receive standard postoperative care . All data record specially design Performa . Statistical analysis : Data analyze use SPSS version 12 . Mean standard deviation calculate quantitative data like age , duration surgery , time onset hunger , bowel movement , flatus pass defecation . Frequency percentages calculate qualitative data like gender . The result finally analyze compare three group use one way ANOVA . The data two group ( A versus B , A versus C , B versus C ) analyze independent sample test . Pearson correlation use see correlation duration surgery bowel movement . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant</detailed_description>
