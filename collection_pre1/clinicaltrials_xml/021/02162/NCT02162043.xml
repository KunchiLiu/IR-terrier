	<brief_summary>This project aim evaluate self-administered screen test glaucoma , second large cause blindness western world . New approach glaucoma screen need significant number patient first present hospital advanced-stage glaucoma late presentation associate much high risk future blindness . This project develop new user-friendly visual field test make available internet self-testing . It conduct hospital-based community-based clinical trial establish benefit cost new test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Evaluation Self-administered/Assisted Visual Field Screening Tool Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : At recent ( 19/4/2013 ) Priority Setting Partnership workshop , facilitate James Lind Alliance , patient , carers eye health professional produce list top ten priority glaucoma research ( http : //www.sightlosspsp.org.uk/ ) . Number 4 list : What do improve early diagnosis sight-threatening glaucoma ? The overarch aim project develop evaluate new visual field screen self-test use improve early detection glaucoma thereby meet one aim Priority Setting Partnership . We conduct hospital- community-based clinical trial new test establish performance . Methodology : This project clinically evaluate new test deriving measure sensitivity specificity . These trial conduct patient attend outpatient department Manchester Royal Eye Hospital ( MREH ) use simulated defect link performance measure extent field damage . Patients without establish field loss test . On completion hospital-based clinical trial undertake locally base community trial establish performance self-administered administer aid friends/family , i.e . without researcher/clinician involvement . We make test available ( emailed attachment install test patient PC , laptop , tablet ) patient attend glaucoma clinic MREH request test friend relatives . Guidance note emphasise increase risk develop glaucoma blood relative increase risk age help target high risk develop glaucoma . Those fail screening test , twice , undergo test one Glaucoma Referral Refinement optometrists Manchester derive estimate true false referral rate .</detailed_description>
