	<brief_summary>Background : Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy ( ARB ) one 5 blinding eye disease cause mutation gene BEST1 . These disease , collectively term `` bestrophinopathies '' include ARB , Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ( BVMD ) , adult-onset vitelliform dystrophy ( AVMD ) , autosomal dominant vitreoretinalchoroidopathy ( ADVIRC ) retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) . Objective : To collect DNA/RNA skin sample individual ARB disease due mutation gene BEST1 . These model use identify test therapeutic approach treat disease . Design : Study involve one time donation skin punch biopsy whole blood . Once skin biopsy obtain , skin fibroblast isolate , reprogrammed iPSCs . RPE cell derive iPSCs</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The PI proposal study BEST1 protein encode ( Best1 ) since discovery 1998 . Best1 integral membrane protein eye express retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) cell localize basolateral plasma membrane . Methods : Once subject identify potential candidate , study coordinator meet subject , discus study prior sample collection . The study coordinator review consent form subject spend much time necessary answer question . Once subject sign consent form , study procedure begin . Following consent process , skin sample obtain subject use ( 4mm ) dermal punch biopsy method . This accomplished single visit Regenerative Medicine Consult Service approve clinical examination room . A suture may need place follow skin biopsy . A health care provider ( either Mayo Clinic local health care provider 's office ) remove stitch , subject remove provide disposable suture removal kit . Subjects also ask undergo venipuncture ; subject ask venipuncture option refuse . 10ml blood collect RNA DNA extraction . Once skin biopsy obtain , skin fibroblast isolate , reprogrammed iPSCs . RPE cell derive iPSCs . Remuneration : If subject make special trip research procedure , may reimburse travel expense include : airfare , mileage , park , hotel . In order receive reimbursement , must provide copy original receipt expense . Reimbursement exceed $ 1000.00 .</detailed_description>
