	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize increase plasma nitrite use dietary nitrate improve platelet function red cell deformability decrease MCHC patient sickle cell disease . The investigator test hypothesis administration daily intake beetroot juice ( Unbeetable - Performance Drink ) patient sickle cell disease 28 day . The investigator evaluate safety daily beet root juice intake patient sickle cell disease . In addition , investigator measure MCHC , red cell deformability , platelet function ( activation aggregation ) response daily intake beet root juice patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease cause dysfunction mutant form hemoglobin polymerize hypoxic condition , sickling red blood cell . Sickling make cell rigid contributes vascular occlusion much morbidity mortality . Cycles sickling unsickling lead calcium ( Ca ) influx activate gardos channel pump potassium cell . Loss potassium lead dehydration , poor deformability , increase mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ( MCHC ) red blood cell . Increased MCHC lead increase polymerization . Thus , significant therapeutic goal sickle cell disease decrease MCHC block Ca-influx induced dehydration . Rifkind coworkers show NO+ donor sodium nitrosoprusside ( SNP ) block Ca-induced loss deformability normal red blood cell expose Ca Ca ionophore . The investigator preliminary data show NO activity donor SNP nitrite partially relieve loss deformability due cycle sickling unsickling red cell patient sickle cell disease . Low nitric oxide ( NO ) bioavailabilty secondary red cell hemolysis propose contribute pathology sickle cell disease . Low NO could lead poor protection Ca-induced potassium loss describe . Another consequence low NO likely increase platelet activation ; sickle cell disease pro-thrombotic disease . NO reduces platelet aggregation activation . It show acute dietary nitrate intervention reduce platelet aggregation healthy volunteer . Nitrate convert nitrite convert NO body.6 Improved platelet function likely due increase NO bioavailability nitrate intervention . In pilot study , safety Beet Juice intake patient sickle cell disease evaluate use self-administered health survey . Physiological effect Beet Juice also examine investigator hypothesize increase plasma nitrite use dietary nitrate improve platelet function red cell deformability decrease MCHC patient sickle cell disease . The investigator test hypothesis administration daily intake Beet Juice patient sickle cell disease 28 day . The investigator measure MCHC , red cell deformability , platelet function ( activation aggregation ) response intervention .</detailed_description>
