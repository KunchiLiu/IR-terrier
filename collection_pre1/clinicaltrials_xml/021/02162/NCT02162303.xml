	<detailed_description>This interventional trial targetting patient 18 year old old carotid artery ascend aorta background ration ( TBR ) â‰¥1.6 determine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) uptake measure positron emission tomography ( PET ) evidence atherosclerotic plaque inflammation . Following randomization , patient follow period 6 month ( 24 week ) , 2 phone contact 6 20 week 2 on-site visit 12 24 week . Each on-site visit include blood draw monitor routine chemistry hematology , well biomarkers lipid profile . Each phone contact include monitor patient 's general health well-being . PET image perform baseline 24-weeks visit . Safety study assess clinical laboratory parameter , physical examination , ECGs , vital sign , frequency intensity clinical adverse event ( AEs ) . The Montreal Health Innovations Coordinating Center ( MHICC ) responsible process quality control data . Project management carry described MHICC standard operating procedure ( SOPs ) clinical study . The handling data , include data quality control , comply applicable regulatory guideline , MHICC SOPs study Data Management Plan . As , MHICC medical monitor appoint trial serious adverse event reporting contact ( 24/7 ) .</detailed_description>
