	<brief_title>A Safety Study JNJ-56021927 Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , multicenter , open-label ( participant know identity study drug receive ) study participant Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( mCRPC ) . The study consist 4 part : Screening ( 28 day study commences Day 1 ) , pharmacokinetic week ( PK ) , Continuous daily dosing , Extension Safety follow-up period . In PK week participant receive single oral capsule JNJ-56021927 dose 240 milligram ( mg ) Day 1 monitor 1 week . After Week 1 , continuous daily dose period , participant receive continuous daily therapy dose 4 week ( Cycle 1 ) . After Cycle 1 participant , meet criterion discontinuation list progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity , continue safety follow-up period receive continuous daily therapy dose cycle 13 . Primarily dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) evaluate . Participants ' safety monitor throughout .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation small cell feature , metastatic disease Castrationresistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) demonstrate continuous androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) /post orchiectomy Maintain castrate level testosterone ( less [ &lt; ] 50 nanogram per deciliter ( ng/dL ) [ 1.72 nanomol per liter { nmol/L } ] ) within 4 week enrollment Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) evidence progressive prostate cancer consist PSA level least great equal ( &gt; = ) 2 nanogram per milliliter ( ng/mL ) within 2 week enrollment rise least 2 successive occasion , least 1 week apart . If confirmatory PSA value less last PSA value , additional test rise PSA required document progression Participants receive first generation antiandrogen [ example , bicalutamide , flutamide , nilutamide ( approve Japan ) ] part initial combine androgen blockade therapy secondline hormonal therapy must show continue disease progression antiandrogen least 4 week prior first dose study drug History , current metastasis brain untreated spinal cord compression Participants progressive epidural disease Participants history another malignancy within 5 year screen Prior treatment second generation antiandrogens ( example , enzalutamide ) Cytochrome P450 17 ( CYP 17 ) inhibitor [ example , abiraterone acetate , orteronel , galeterone , systemic ketoconazole ( approve Japan , respectively ) ] Participants use radiopharmaceutical agent ( example , Strontium89 ) investigational immunotherapy ( example , sipuleucelT ) within 12 week first dose study drug</criteria>
