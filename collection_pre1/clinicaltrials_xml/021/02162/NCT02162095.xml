	<brief_title>Is COPD Risk Factor Cardiovascular Disease ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) suffer significant cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Coronary artery disease often link causally COPD , exact pathophysiological mechanism underpin association remain speculative . A retrospective case-control study match COPD patient control one one smoking history conventional cardiovascular risk factor perform study association COPD cardiovascular outcome . Filling knowledge gap may contribute understand interplay COPD cardiovascular disease . The objective retrospective case-control study determine whether COPD might risk factor coronary atherosclerosis , impaired leave ventricular ejection fraction , major adverse cardiovascular event independent conventional cardiovascular risk factor .</detailed_description>
