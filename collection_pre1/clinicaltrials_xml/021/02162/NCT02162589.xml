	<brief_title>Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy ( POEM ) For The Treatment Of Achalasia : A Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our institution performs therapeutic Interventional Endoscopy around 700-1000 patient year . We come across several patient esophageal disorder , include esophageal cancer Achalasia . Achalasia uncommon esophageal motility disorder cause inability lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) relax due degeneration inhibitory neuron myenteric plexus . ( 1,2 ) Evidence achalasia patient include absence relaxation LES , abnormal swallow relaxation LES , absence peristalsis esophageal body . ( 2,3 ) Treatments achalasia primarily focus force relaxation LES . Conventional treatment botolinum toxin ( Botox ) injection , balloon dilation , nitrate calcium antagonist , Heller myotomy , although effective , many disadvantage . ( 4,5 , 6 ) Balloon dilation , least noninvasive non-surgical process , still result esophageal perforation long term investigation report unfavorable ( 2 ) . Surgical myotomy , Heller myotomy laproscopic esophagomytomy , indicate non-surgical therapy render ineffective . However , gastroesophageal reflux disease occur 30 % ( 7 ) Heller Myotomy patient 10-15 % failure rate ( 8 ) . Per-oral endoscopic myotomy ( POEM ) , derive Advances Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES ) advance submucosal dissection ( 9,10,11 ) , present novel , less invasive , permanent treatment low esophageal sphincter pressure ( 12 ) . POEM first describe Parischa et al porcine model 2007 introduction clinical care 17 patient make Inoue et al 2010 . ( 12,13 ) POEM perform entirely endoscopically , enable much deep incision thoracic esophagus surgery able create . ( 2 , 13 ) An incision make mid- esophagus create submucosal tunnel access muscle layer way gastric cardia conduct myotomy ( partial muscle removal ) . Partial inner circular muscle layer remove last part esophagus , low esophageal sphincter upper part stomach . After myotomy complete , endoclips use seal incision endoscope withdrawn . ( 2 ) The effectiveness POEM indicate patient study base mostly Europe Asia . Recent study report POEM 90 % effectiveness rate compare patient undergone Heller myotomy . ( 9 ,14,15 ) Based study design result recent study do Europe Asia ( retrospective ) , would like evaluate verify technical feasibility , clinical success safety clinically indicate POEM Achalasia prospectively longer follow duration ( 6 month ) . Evaluation factor would help u compare conventional treatment modality within current facility ; consequently help u identify appropriate treatment technique improve clinical management patient WCMC-NYPH . The purpose retrospective prospective registry ass long term data efficacy , safety clinical outcome POEM . The registry evaluate technical feasibility , clinical outcome , safety profile overall clinical management medical chart review . The procedure evaluate clinically indicate prescribe someone participate registry study . The purpose retrospective prospective registry ass long term data efficacy , safety clinical outcome POEM . The registry evaluate technical feasibility , clinical outcome , safety profile overall clinical management medical chart review . Study Design : Retrospective Prospective , observational , medical chart review least 6 standard care visit 1 year subject consent study participation . Interventions : None Subject Participation : Subject 's participation study allow u collect data least 6 standard care visit 1 year consent participate registry study . Subject undergo standard care clinically indicate Endoscopic procedure POEM subsequent follow clinic visit part standard medical care . Subject sign separate clinical consent Endoscopic procedure placement suture ( ) . That consent form explain procedure well risk involve procedure . Subject undergo endoscopic procedure POEM subsequent follow clinic visit regardless participation study . Subject undergo additional test procedure part study . Study duration : At least 6 standard care visit 1 year subject . Once subject consent , data collect clinically indicate standard care procedure visit follow visit . Research related activity : Consenting , medical chart review case report form entry . Clinically indicated necessary procedure include : Evaluation , imaging , lab test , adverse event monitor POEM . Standard care follow visit POEM usually 15 day , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month post procedure . All data collect Medical chart . No subject survey questionnaire administer . Study Design Coordinating Center - Primary site ( WCMC ) : T All patient clinically indicate POEM do Achalasia . Study Design Secondary site : Other site must either database review protocol and/or clinical trial would collect data POEM prior participate registry . These site would IRB approve protocol collect send procedure data primary site ( WCMC ) . Additionally , secondary study site would mention WCMC entity could receive PHI respective protocol consent/HIPAA form . All secondary study site ' IRB approval send primary/coordinating study center WCMC IRB . Data share agreement finalize prior share confidential data . Registry Hosting : The coordinating center primary site ( WCMC ) host registry local server . Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system REDCAP use data entry , compilation querying . Secondary site train Redcap login ID provide . REDCAP data site accessible primary coordinate site investigator . The data store REDCAP server . Specific access/editing permission grant per standard protocol personnel secondary site enter data .</detailed_description>
