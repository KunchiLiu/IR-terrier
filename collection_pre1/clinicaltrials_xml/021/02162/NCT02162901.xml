	<brief_summary>The aim project evaluate reach , effectiveness , cost two patient-centered , theory-based , technology-enhanced diabetes prevention program initiate sustain weight loss among pre-diabetic adult ( i.e . impaired fast glucose impair glucose tolerance ) within health care set . The overall aim consistent NIDDK 's Behavioral/Prevention Research Program 's focus individual , family , community-based strategy prevention diabetes complication . While evidence lifestyle intervention increase physical activity improve eat habit achieve modest weight loss delay prevent onset type 2 diabetes continue mount , translation intervention effective program health care setting modest resource remain challenge . The propose research project conduct pragmatic clinical trial employ hybrid Preference/Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) design compare two technology-enhanced diabetes prevention program achieve objectively verify weight loss relative standard care control comparatively low cost . Adult patient ( 18 year age old ) risk develop diabetes randomize either Choice group Randomization group . Those patient randomized Choice group ( n=240 ) opportunity choose one two program participate : 1 . A 2-hour Small-Group ( SG ) session , automate interactive voice response ( IVR ) system target personal action plan support lifestyle change weight loss period 12 month ; 2 . A DVD-based intervention IVR follow-up . Those patient assign RCT group ( n=360 ) randomize one three group : 1 . SG/IVR ; 2 . DVD/IVR ; 3 . Enhanced standard-care ( SC ) . SC include referral currently offer pre-diabetes class . Primary outcome measure include weight loss , cost , reach program . Secondary outcome measure include physical activity behavior ; eat behavior ; process evaluation . It hypothesize SG/IVR DVD/IVR intervention produce significantly great amount weight loss 6 , 12 , 18 month follow program initiation SC differ one another . The investigator also hypothesize DVD/IVR broad reach may cost-effective SG/IVR SC .</brief_summary>
