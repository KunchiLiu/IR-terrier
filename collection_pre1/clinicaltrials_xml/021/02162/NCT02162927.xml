	<brief_summary>In past , dietary nitrate supplementation show clinical benefit treatment cardiovascular issue . More recently , however , focus nitrate supplementation shift focus human performance , show increase time exhaustion maximal intensity exercise lower cost oxygen consumption submaximal intensity exercise . Acutely , nitrate supplementation form beetroot juice show increase strength measurement , well increase time complete 2000 meter row ergometer test . However , author 's knowledge , study link relationship multi-day nitrate supplementation row test nitrate 's effect strength salt form . Additionally , author 's knowledge , evidence publish relates dietary nitrate supplementation effect CrossFit circuit workout . Our central hypothesis six day dietary nitrate supplementation improve strength , endurance , power placebo male CrossFit athlete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose randomize , double-blind , crossover study identify dietary nitrate supplementation improve strength , endurance , power measurement male CrossFit athlete . Specifically , strength measurement take use isometric isokinetic test Biodex dynamometer . Endurance measure use time trial 2000 meter row test `` Fran '' CrossFit workout . Finally , power analyze use Wingate cycle test . The treatment group receive 1 serve f potassium nitrate KNO3- ( N ) ( 8 mmols NO3- ) . The placebo group receive 1 serve nitrate-free placebo ( PL ) potassium chloride ( 8 mmol KCl ) . The participant complete two three-day baseline testing , six-day supplementation period follow round baseline test . Following first six-day supplementation period , 10 day washout period second baseline test begin .</detailed_description>
