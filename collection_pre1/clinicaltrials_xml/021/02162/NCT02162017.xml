	<brief_title>Head Position Stroke Trial ( HeadPoST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary aim compare effect lie flat ( 0° ) head position sit ( ≥30° ) head position apply first 24 hour admission , patient present acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) , poor outcome death disability 90 day . Key secondary aim determine whether lie flat superior sit poor outcome ( death neurological impairment ) 7 day AIS ; whether sit superior lie flat outcome acute intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) . The hospital require undertake recruitment 70 consecutive acute stroke patient stroke type , power calculation undertake target 50 AIS patient per site . In use consecutive patient recruitment , anticipated average 10 ICH patient also include within 70 target patient , cross interventional phase another 70 target patient recruit . The hospital training , prior activation commencement intervention . Data collection baseline , first 24 hour , discharge/ Day 7 , Day 90 ( end follow-up ) , capture web database . Randomised allocation intervention assign statistician otherwise involve study accord statistical program stratify country site . A mixed consent process propose , accord local/national rule regulation , follow protocol : 1 . Cluster Guardian consent appropriate approval ( e.g . sign General Manager Chief Executive hospital , Head Neurology/Stroke Department ) randomise head position new usual nursing care patient acute stroke ; 2 . With one following : . Individual standard consent collection data in-person assessment data extraction medical record hospital stay follow-up , release personalised information research purpose allow centralise follow-up 90 day admission , ii . Opt-out consent collection data in-person assessment data extraction medical record hospital stay follow-up , release personalised information research purpose allow centralise follow-up 90 day admission . All acute stroke patient manage dedicate stroke team acute stroke unit ( high dependency unit intensive care unit ) period intervention . During intervention follow-up period , management acute stroke patient follow accord publish guideline . It anticipate background care may include use specific treatment include drug , intravascular reperfusion therapy surgical evacuation . As part standard stroke care , swallow function evaluate use local standard procedure initiation feed . The internet base data management system manage George Institute Global Health , extensive experience clinical trial data capture security . The George Institute place system security SOP VeriSign SSL digital certification encrypt HTTPS connection . Only staff list delegation log give unique individual password access internet-based data management system . Paper CRFs provide site prefer use initial collection data . These form use source document need sign dated investigator complete form . All computerise form electronically sign ( use unique password ) authorise study staff change make follow initial entry electronic date audit trail . It requirement collection data transfer information 90 day follow-up assessment approve local IRB site . The power study derive large number cluster , achievable workload centre keep low . The inflation cluster size number cluster take account , stroke mimic , poor recruitment and/or quality issue site . The target 70 patient intervention derive 10 patient initial learning phase , 50 AIS 10 ICH . For small Stroke Units admit 200 stroke per annum , likely achieve 4-5 month , include crossover 3 month follow-up total duration study ~12 month . However , large stroke unit , many hospital China , 1200 case stroke admit per annum , require 70 patient recruit ~3 week , study duration 4-5 month . Thus , overall target number stroke patient recruit centre 140 ( i.e . 2 x 70 ) , take 1 10 month consider crossover accord size ( i.e . stroke case load ) hospital study duration 4 12 month per site consider follow-up . All analyse undertaken patient level intention-to-treat basis define allocate head position centre use Generalised Estimating Equations ( GEE ) random-effects regression account cluster . Publication main report study name HeadPoST Collaborative Investigators . Full editorial control reside Writing Committee approve Steering Committee ( SC ) . Central international coordination GI , Sydney together RCCs establish locate Beijing China , Preston UK , Paris France Santiago Chile , study overseen International SC comprise world expert field stroke , neurocritical care , neurology , geriatrics , cardiovascular epidemiology clinical trial . The ICC also support key grant holder regional expert Operations Committee ( OC ) . The PIs 140 participate hospital ( see study organisational chart ) administratively tie structure design enhance effective communication , collaboration study monitoring maintain operation adherence common protocol . Data Safety &amp; Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) : The DSMB review safety , ethic outcome study . The DSMB govern charter outline responsibility , procedure confidentiality .

The first meeting hold 3 month start study . One two formal interim analysis plan review data relate treatment efficacy , patient safety quality trial conduct .</detailed_description>
