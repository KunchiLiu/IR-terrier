	<detailed_description>The SPP study prospective population-based case-control study . We include incident case pancreatic cancer Stockholm county region 2008 2014 . Controls randomly select general population Stockholm region , individually match case age sex . Cases selection . The criterion case selection include age le 85 year , bear Sweden presently live county Stockholm . The case pancreatic cancer first identify within framework clinical healthcare system Stockholm County . Through network , consist surgical clinic oncological clinic Stockholm county area , able include vast majority case diagnose radiological method , ask participate study . After informed consent obtain patient , study coordinator Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge notify . The coordinator inform Statistics Sweden interviewer interview case patient . Further , radiological diagnosis pancreatic cancer , try retrieve tumor biopsy every case . In total around 30 % case surgically resect remain 70 % patient treat palliative intention among 80 % biopsied use fine needle aspiration ( remain 20 % biopsied practical reason clinical deterioration ) , thus result total proportion patient tumor tissue retain close 90 % . Control selection . The control person ( non-cancer patient ) randomly identify via Statistics Sweden . For case , gender- age-matched ( birth year ) control person identify randomly general population Stockholm County . Data collection . Through professional interviewer Statistics Sweden , interview conduct concern environmental factor case control person . As soon study coordinator identify case pancreatic cancer patient accept participate , Statistics Sweden contact patient 's identify location . Professional interviewer , blind research hypothesis study , contact go patient home , hospital wherever patient perform interview calculate take around 1 hour 15 minute . The questionnaire contain item concern demographic , socioeconomic factor , physical activity , height weight history , tobacco snuff use , dental health , earlier concomitant disease medication history . A structured food frequency questionnaire , modify version previously evaluate questionnaire , include 63 food beverage item interest , use evaluate dietary habit 20 year prior interview . Once case identify , set 5 control ( sex birth year ) Stockholm general population select Statistics Sweden . The control person list contact order , control person agrees participate study . The interviewer perform interview exactly way case . For case control , agree , 20 ml blood collect . The sample separate serum cell ( red white together ) aliquot 4 separate serum ( subsequent protein analysis ) sample 2 cell sample Ficoll gradient ( subsequent DNA RNA analysis ) immediately frozen -80Â°C . Control persons decline leave blood sample instead offer leave saliva sample , DNA extract analyzed .</detailed_description>
