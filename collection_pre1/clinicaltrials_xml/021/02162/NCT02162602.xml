	<brief_summary>Compromised bone strength increase fracture susceptibility pose significant morbidity health care cost child . Inadequate childhood bone accretion also may lifelong consequence . Bone fragility among child chronic medical condition special concern . Identifying child at-risk bone fragility factor affect bone strength require understand normal bone development . Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) common method measure bone mineral content bone density child . There bone density reference data child age 5-20 year . An important gap lack reference data child age &lt; 5 year , also experience numerous medical condition threaten bone health . Growth body composition influence bone mineral accrual , important interpret bone density measurement child condition threaten bone health . Gross motor skill subsequent physical activity may also affect bone accrual . Children chronic illness risk alter body composition , delayed growth gross motor skill , restrict physical activity . Understanding independent effect growth , body composition , gross motor skill physical activity bone accrual improve interpretation bone density measurement important research clinical application identify risk factor therapy young child . This study involve longitudinal cohort 280 child study every 6 month 3 year , cross-sectional cohort 240 child measure . The study conduct 2 clinical center [ Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( CCHMC ) Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) ] equal enrollment center . Measurements include bone density , growth body composition , dietary intake , sleep , physical activity gross motor skill . Results study enable clinical bone health assessment young child disorder threaten bone health , identify factor affect bone accrual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study seek understand bone mineral accrual child 1 5 year age . Many young child chronic medical condition threaten bone health increase susceptibility fracture . Over last 10 year team Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( CCHMC ) help develop reference data enable clinician identify child 5 20 low bone density age optimize medical care . A glaring deficit inability evaluate bone health young child &lt; 5 due lack appropriate bone density reference data . This gap problematic numerous clinical condition ( e.g. , neuromuscular disease , cancer , glucocorticoid treatment , extreme prematurity ) threaten bone health young age group . The primary goal new study develop bone mass density reference data aid identification child 1 5 year age bone deficit . A first step characterize age-related change bone accrual multiple skeletal site determine sex race difference bone mass density emerge . The second goal study assess influence growth , body composition , gross motor skill physical activity bone mineral accrual young child . In old child , need account growth lean mass interpret bone measurement demonstrate . The best way young child unknown . Pronounced change gross motor skill , locomotion physical activity also occur early childhood . It well appreciate mechanical load grow skeleton promote bone mineral accrual . gross motor skill physical activity impact bone development child 1 5 year age unknown . Understanding impact growth , body composition , motor skill development , physical activity bone accrual young child important interpretation clinical bone density measurement . These characteristic often affect young child chronic medical condition . This study enroll 520 healthy child 1 5 year age ; half recruit CCHMC half Children 's Hospital Philadelphia . This study unique since previous study address issue child 1-5 . It clinically relevant finding facilitate medical care child chronic medical condition threaten bone health , develop validate novel method bone body composition assessment age range . It also add generalizable knowledge enhance understand grow skeleton , relationship motor somatic development . Since poor bone mineral accrual lifelong consequence , study address major public health concern osteoporosis .</detailed_description>
