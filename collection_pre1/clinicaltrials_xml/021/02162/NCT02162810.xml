	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine efficacy administer course postoperative oral steroid pediatric patient undergo proximal hypospadias repair prevention complication . Specifically , study aim ass steroid ) decrease incidence wind breakdown , fistula formation , stenosis stricture formation , need subsequent redo-hypospadias surgery and/or fistula repair ii ) improve quality wound heal include overall cosmetic appearance phallus ( i.e . location urethral meatus ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Steroids Post-Operative Complications Following Proximal Hypospadias Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypospadias repair surgery , unfortunately , fraught high complication rate problem include urethrocutaneous fistula formation , complete wound breakdown , glans dehiscence , urethral diverticulum formation , retraction urethral meatus , urethral stricture , meatal stenosis . Failure proximal hypospadias repair ( i.e . development post-operative complication ) unpredictable , modifiable risk factor identify . Complications necessitate subsequent surgical intervention pediatric patient , must carry general anesthesia . Evidence regard harm multiple general anesthetic child increase . Additionally , surgical revision come morbidity associate another post-surgical convalescence . Thus , measure gain way increase rate success proximal hypospadias repair would help pediatric urologist patient hypospadias . The propose intervention administer 5 day course placebo versus oral steroid dose equivalent give outpatient treatment asthma exacerbation , expect low risk . This would variation current practice one never study past . Thus , would worthwhile perform use scientific method determine administration short course oral steroid benefit heal minimization post-operative complication hypospadias patient .</detailed_description>
