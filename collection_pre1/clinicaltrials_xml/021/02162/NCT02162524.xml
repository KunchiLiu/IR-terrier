	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study quantify activation region brain associate appetite reward view high sugar high fat ( HS/HF ) image compare control image follow long-term aerobic exercise . 1 . After long-term aerobic exercise compare no-exercise control group , view HS/HF food image vs. control image result high activation region brain associate appetite ( hypothalamus ) . 2 . After long-term aerobic exercise compare no-exercise control group consumption sucrose solution compare artificially sweeten solution tasteless solution , view HS/HF food image vs. control image result low activation region brain associate reward [ amygdala , anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) , Orbitalfrontal Cortex ( OFC ) , ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) , striatum , insula ] overweight obese men woman . Exploratory Aims As exploratory aim , investigator test preliminary brain connectivity analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Images Following Long-term Aerobic Exercise Brain Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pilot study , investigator use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) determine effect high calorie visual food cue [ i.e . image foods high sugar fat ( HS/HF ) , ice cream ] activation appetite reward pathway brain follow long-term ( 6 month ) exercise . Obesity rate high among US adult 33.8 % adult BMI 30 great ( 1 ) . The prevailing belief homeostatic system place monitor energy homeostasis . With aerobic physical activity , appetite affect theoretically positive couple energy intake expenditure think occur ( 2 , 3 ) . During exercise day , short term study demonstrate difference appetite except transient decrease 15 minute post exercise hard exercise ( 4 ) . Short term exercise result appetitive difference ( 5-7 ) . However medium term , variable ( mixed ) response ( 5 ) . Over long-term thought loose couple exists exercise appetite response ( 5 ) . Our preliminary data strongly support positive coupling exercise appetitive response previous study amount weight loss achieve follow aerobic exercise less expect . Specifically , study Tim Church previously find hypertensive overweight postmenopausal woman lose ~2.6 kg instead 1.4 kg ( 8 ) . This 46 % difference much weight lose due energy expend exercise compare actual amount . Another study examine 4 month moderate intensity aerobic exercise 16KKW ( 9 ) 2.7 kg weight loss expect 1.1 kg achieve . This suggest 59 % difference . Both study low dropout rate . Based result high dose exercise two study , discrepancy grows increase exercise dose . The participant instruct change eat habit physical activity outside intervention significantly alter . These body weight response mirror majority aerobic exercise intervention study . King et al . perform supervised aerobic exercise study ( 10 ) . 58 person complete 500 kcal/d exercise induce energy expenditure 5 d/wk 12 week 28 % dropout rate . Overall average 3.2 kg body weight lose . Over 50 % person fail lose expect amount 15 % person gain weight ( 11 ) . Four ten study review find exercise even result body weight difference exercise control group ( 12 ) . This differential response energy balance think driven increase energy intake . Stubbs et al . perform randomized crossover study 3-7 day exercise treatment . The exercise treatment exercise , medium exercise ( ~1.9 MJ/day ) lastly high exercise ( ~ 3.4MJ/day ) . Energy expenditure increase exercise ( 9.2 MJ/day ) , medium exercise ( 11.0 MJ/day ) high exercise condition ( 12.1 MJ/day ) , respectively . A statistically significant increase energy intake exercise find ( exercise 8.9 MJ/day , medium exercise 9.2 MJ/day , high exercise 10.0 MJ/d ) . Thus base body weight energy intake data Stubbs et al . investigator feel biological drive increase energy intake follow exercise . Investigators seek determine neural mechanism appetitive response propose grant . Previously 2 aerobic exercise study examine neuronal response image perform . Ours similar provide PBRC pilot data investigation . Evero et al . previously find reward pathway neuronal cue reduce follow aerobic exercise ( 13 ) . Cornier et al . find chronic exercise alters neuronal response food cue . However study confound due significant weight loss state generally happen aerobic exercise trial . The result suggest insula may particularly important exercise induce weight loss weight loss maintenance ( 14 ) . This study hop examine neuronal response aerobic exercise without weight loss . Obesity Women show food picture cue high energy food . The high energy food produce significantly great activation brain reward region obese compare normal weight control woman ( 15 ) . Differences group include ACC , VTA , nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) , amygdala , ventral pallidum ( Vent Pall ) , Caudate , Putamen ( 15 ) . Postmeal , obese individual , normal weight individual , increase activation putamen ( part striatum ) amygdala suggest region may play role overeat ( 16 ) region incorporate current study hypothesis . These cross-sectional study important previously Murdaugh et . al ( 17 ) find obese individual successful short term weight loss long term weight loss maintenance great activation reward pathway brain region . While speculative , artificial sweetener may reduce craving activate reward pathway especially obese person . This grant help provide pilot data elucidate important question .</detailed_description>
