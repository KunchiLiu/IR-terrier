	<brief_summary>The primary goal project determine advanced glycation end-product ( AGEs ) accumulation shoulder movement ( humeral thoracic range motion `` activity count '' ) interact contribute shoulder limit joint mobility ( LJM ) , pain disability , intervention consist tailor dose stretch active shoulder movement reduce problem people diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . The investigator focus follow measure span health domain ; Skin intrinsic fluorescence measure AGEs ; Ultrasound measure supraspinatus tendon thickness ; 3 dimensional joint range motion `` activity count '' measure shoulder movement ; Disability Arm , Shoulder Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire measure patient report pain disability . The investigator test innovative hypothesis metabolic movement factor interact cause severe shoulder problem people DM optimize shoulder movement intervention important impact reduce development limit joint mobility , pain disability population .</brief_summary>
