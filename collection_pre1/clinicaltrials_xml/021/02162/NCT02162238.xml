	<brief_summary>Introduction : The prevalence low serum zinc child 5 East Seme , Kisumu 73.5 % likely due least part low bioavailable zinc local cereal-based diet . Interventions increase zinc intake could prove useful effort control zinc deficiency . A potential strategy increase zinc intake enrich fortified water . The Life Straw Family filter ( LSF , Verstergaard Frandsen S.A , Switzerland ) capable purify water time enrich zinc variable concentration mean delivery approximately 1-4mg/L . Aims study : The primary aim study quantify 5 year old child contribution household LSF device zinc intake dietary zinc bioavailability participate household . Secondary objective ; 1 ) ass change serum zinc level , growth , morbidity intervention group compare control ; 2 ) characterize composition intestinal flora child intervention group compare control . Study Design Methods : Consenting household East Seme , Kisumu , Kenya randomly allocate 2 treatment arm effectiveness study ( 90 under-five 's per treatment arm ) . Group one receive LSF device zinc delivery system ; group 2 receive LSF without zinc delivery system . Zinc intake assess subsample 5 year old child enrol effectiveness trial ( n=100 ) . This estimate 24 hr recall administer 2 non-consecutive day dry wet season . Selected food sample collect direct analysis zinc phytic acid content , supplement data food composition table ( FCT 's ) . The dietary assessment data use estimate distribution zinc intake age group EAR cut-off method use estimate proportion risk inadequate intake . Data water intake LSF device obtain personal diary tally counter . The Zn concentration filter water measure weekly . Using data data dietary assessment , contribution LSF zinc delivery overall dietary zinc intake estimate . The effectiveness study conduct 6-month double blind randomise trial 3 assessment time point ( baseline , midpoint endpoint ) . Three ml ( 3ml ) whole blood collect 5 year old child enrol household determination serum zinc ( SZn ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Alpha-1- acid glycoprotein ( AGP ) hemoglobin ( Hb ) . Stool sample collect subsample baseline , midpoint endpoint intervention control group assess composition gut microflora gut inflammation . Anthropometrics ( weight height ) measure baseline , midpoint endpoint study . Weekly active surveillance incidence severity malaria , diarrhea infectious disease do questionnaire .</brief_summary>
