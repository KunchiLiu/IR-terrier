	<brief_summary>Hypotensive Anesthesia type regional anesthesia perform routinely hospital . This type anesthesia reduces average arterial pressure . Benefits include reduce bleed low risk blood clot . The purpose study determine effect intravenous fluid administer hypotensive anesthesia blood volume . With parameter able understand much blood lose bleeding much drop relate dilution . Study hypothesis : Hemodilution associate intravenous fluid substitution hypotensive anesthesia result decrease postoperative hemoglobin ( Hb ) level</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blood Volume Analysis Total Hip Arthroplasty Patients Under Hypotensive Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent technology allow measurement patient ' total blood volume 98 % accuracy within 90 minute less . This key understanding effect hypotensive anesthesia patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty . The drop blood pressure enhance dilutional effect intravenous fluid give procedure . Increases TBV could result decrease postoperative hemoglobin . Understanding effect hypotensive anesthesia postoperative hemoglobin level TBV enhance understand postoperative blood management transfusion trigger .</detailed_description>
