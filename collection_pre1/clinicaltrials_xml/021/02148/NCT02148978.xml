	<brief_summary>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) chronic disease characterize recurrent pulmonary infection exocrine pancreatic insufficiency . The vast majority patient CF develop pancreatic endocrine insufficiency time manifest alter glucose metabolism . The presence overt diabetes patient CF associate adverse clinical outcome . The underlie pathophysiology cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) still matter investigation . In addition localize tissue damage develop similar exocrine pancreas , additional mechanism may involve . The investigator recently show insulin secretion patient CF significantly alter prior development diabetes . This phenomenon associate reduced secretion gut derive incretins ( specifically GIP ) . The blunting incretin induced insulin secretion ( whether due derange interaction gastrointestinal content enterocytes result reduce secretion due rapid clearance peptide ) may major underlie driver alter glucose metabolism patient .</brief_summary>
