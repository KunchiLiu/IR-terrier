	<detailed_description>This PrEP demonstration study design assess feasibility impact deliver PrEP addition exist package HIV prevention intervention available female sex worker India . The study aim : 1 ) identify female sex worker need HIV prevention willing take PrEP ; 2 ) evaluate sustain uptake adherence oral PrEP ; 3 ) ass safe delivery PrEP ; 4 ) demonstrate effective delivery PrEP within context National Program Targeted Interventions . The study implement two region among two typology female sex worker India : brothel-based FSWs Kolkata FSWs operate different setting Mysore Mandya . Outcome 1 : Identification female sex worker need HIV prevention willing take oral PrEP For optimal delivery limited resource , critical provide HIV prevention strategy PrEP population great risk infection . Female sex worker important population HIV prevention India , prioritize `` core high risk group '' target intervention India National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) ( NACO 2013 annual report ) . In particular , FSWs report inconsistent condom use unmet need HIV prevention ( Ramesh , 2010 ; Reza-Paul , 2008 ) . For example , woman may less empowered able consistently demand condom use client may wish become pregnant . PrEP potential additional , acceptable effective HIV prevention method female sex worker difficulty use condom consistently . This study propose development use risk screen tool identify female sex worker vulnerable HIV . This tool guide recruitment demonstration study could later assist health provider decide benefit PrEP HIV prevention . In addition , study assess proportion FSWs identify risk screen tool willing take PrEP . Quantitative qualitative evaluation identify factor related decision initiate PrEP well reason FSWs decline PrEP . Outcome 2 : Sustained uptake adherence oral PrEP among female sex worker Similar medication , sustain uptake adherence PrEP fundamental efficacy prevent HIV acquisition . In four clinical trial oral PrEP demonstrate efficacy , study participant high adherence great protection HIV ( Baeten 2012 , Choopanya 2013 , Grant 2010 , Thigpen 2012 ) . Likewise , across PrEP trial , clear relationship high efficacy great proportion participant study drug detectable blood . Two randomized clinical trial daily oral PrEP among heterosexual woman Africa find efficacy HIV prevention ; poor adherence PrEP likely explain result ( Marrazzo 2013 , Van Damme 2012 ) . For example , drug level test FEM-PrEP Study find less 40 % random sample HIV negative woman PrEP arm study detectable level PrEP blood ( Van Damme 2012 ) . Analyses high-risk subgroup study participant Partners PrEP Study find PrEP efficacy estimate range 64 84 % , show consistently high efficacy PrEP prevent HIV across various high risk group , include woman ( Murnane 2013 ) . Preliminary community awareness campaign PrEP among female sex worker Kolkata find high interest PrEP - approximately 80 % report willingness take daily , oral PrEP . Sex worker Mysore-Mandya engage series consultation information relate PrEP tool combination prevention discuss question concern related PrEP address . In place , initial observation show sex worker ( e.g . long time contract , overnight client sometimes number client disclose , want pregnant , use condom regular partner ) express interest part demonstration project . This PrEP demonstration study assess acceptability feasibility two approach PrEP delivery : 1 ) peer educator delivery every day ; 2 ) weekly clinic pick-up . Study staff measure PrEP initiation , adherence discontinuation . They record event participant record , quarterly visit use assess adherence biological test questionnaire . PrEP deliver part package HIV prevention service , therefore use prevention strategy , condom use , also monitor . The full package prevention service continue provide FSWs support India 's national government accordance national guideline . Data drug adherence condom use collect various mean .

The study also include biological measure PrEP adherence assessment drug-levels blood . Regular counsel HIV prevention PrEP provide study participant promote adherence . In sub-sample study participant , electronic adherence monitoring device measure promote adherence , Helping Hands , test ( De Blaser 2010 ) . The Helping Hands device compliment web platform illustrate patient-specific data monitor dose history adherence pattern . Outcome 3 : Oral HIV PrEP part combine prevention package deliver safely female sex worker Four randomize control trial demonstrate daily , oral PrEP safe HIV-uninfected woman wide range setting ; antiretrovirals prove safe HIV-infected woman many year use . The common side effect FTC/TDF minor short-lived ( i.e . first several week ) . This study provide evidence safe delivery oral PrEP female sex worker brothel street-based setting India . Quarterly clinic visit assess physical health , side effect , adverse event social harm concern PrEP use . This study invest continuous engagement community female sex worker accord good participatory practice guideline provide correct information PrEP , keep community continuously engage , maintain adherence PrEP . A community advisory board ( CAB ) Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) set . The CAB meet monthly need basis . It inform study staff concern community may relate study , study staff respond timely manner . The CAB member close community able respond community concern call meeting address issue timely manner .
