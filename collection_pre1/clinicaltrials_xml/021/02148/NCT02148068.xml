	<brief_summary>Obesity important public health issue worldwide . In United States , percentage overweight obese adult increase 47 15 % , respectively , 69 36 % last 40 year . Medically supervised attempt weight loss fraught failure recidivism . Surgical approach important issue durable effective . The gold standard approach surgical treatment obesity attendant medical comorbidities laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy ( LSG ) . The mechanisms two operation work associate side effect completely understood . It establish RYGB induces change fatty tissue mass ( FTM ) lean body mass ( LBM ) post-operatively . This associated decrease bone mineral density , basal metabolic rate , potentially ability maintain weight loss . There incomplete information influence LSG body composition . This study propose evaluation change body composition occur follow two disparate operation . Using serial measurement BodPod collect information patient ' dietary intake , exercise habit comorbidity resolution , study help well define influence LSG body composition . It hypothesize addition malabsorptive component result increase speed weight loss overall weight loss negative impact preservation lean tissue mass patient . This information use bariatric surgeon well cater surgical procedure post-operative plan patient 's body make medical comorbidities .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Procedures - All patient undergo bariatric surgery . The decision undergo weight loss surgery operation choose occur independent prior enrollment study . The University Iowa Bariatric Center Excellence three active , board-certified bariatric surgeon . - Serial BodPod examination perform patient . The BodPod commercially available device produce Cosmed . It use whole-body densitometry determine body composition . To , take small change volume air BodPod chamber record associate change pressure . The pressure change typically go unnoticed equivalent change pressure move first floor second floor elevator . The entire process take approximately five minute two minute spend within machine . The computer use mathematical formula calculate various body composition value . - Laboratory analysis - There battery lab order pre-operative post-operative time frame . These lab order independent patient 's participation study . These lab order assist management patient 's medical comorbidities assess adequate nutritional intake . These lab also record research database assist quantify degree resolution medical comorbidities . - Queries nutritional intake exercise make post-operative appointment . The intake protein important variable may influence maintenance lean tissue mass . Exercise important component post-bariatric weight loss program . This also influence change lean tissue mass .</detailed_description>
