	<brief_summary>While surgical anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ( ACLR ) knee restores passive stability , study show consistently poor long-term outcome . Unusually high risk early-onset osteoarthritis re-injury , low rate return sport follow ACLR seem relate chronic tendency land stiff-legged jump hop , may due fear re-injury . Decreased knee bend force absorption simultaneously decrease performance level increase risk injury arthritic change . The purpose propose study compare current best-practice plyometric training program one utilizing body weight support increase repetition improve performance initial phase . The investigator hypothesize see large improvement absorptive capacity knee well confidence activity immediately follow body weight support training , well improve retention train effect two-month period .</brief_summary>
