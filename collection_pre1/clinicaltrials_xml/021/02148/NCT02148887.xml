	<detailed_description>Functional recovery follow human spinal cord injury ( SCI ) remain frustratingly limited majority patient leave severe impairment . While rehabilitative train show improve clinical outcome follow SCI major effect patient ' quality life , neuronal mechanism underpin neurological functional recovery well understood . Until recently , degenerative change component CNS remote SCI think occur slowly ( year ) correlate degree disability . Using longitudinal MRI protocol show structural change fact occur early progress cord brain level accord specific spatial temporal pattern ( Freund et al 2013 ) . It think trauma-induced structural change progress retrogradely along central motor nerve fibre myelinated corticospinal tract ( CST ) accompany time shrinkage corticospinal project neuronal body . Crucially , patient less atrophy throughout CST well clinical recovery twelve month . Despite significant recovery advantage patient , participant show irreversible tissue loss , potentially hinder recovery . Using neuroimaging biomarkers establish previous study cite , aim ass whether specific intensive motor learn task upper low limb might slow reverse atrophy see sensorimotor system .</detailed_description>
