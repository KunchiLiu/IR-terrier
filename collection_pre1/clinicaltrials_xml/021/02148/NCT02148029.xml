	<brief_summary>Despite standard care , 25 % -50 % patient clots deep vein arm legs progress chronic post-clot problem result significant disability , loss productivity , healthcare cost . Reverse flow vein organize clot primary cause post-clot problem . Veins early clot breakdown low incidence reverse flow . The investigator observe clot breakdown enhance increase blood flow moderate arm leg exercise result increase venous blood flow . Hence , investigator predict supervised exercise program patient deep vein clot could increase leg vein blood flow , accelerate clot breakdown , decrease risk post clot problem . The primary hypothesis increase blood flow across clot ( induce supervise exercise ) increase clot breakdown decrease severity post clot problem . The investigator conduct randomized clinical trial standard therapy compare progressive exercise training patient leg deep vein clot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard anticoagulation therapy acute deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) reflect current short term focus prevent pulmonary embolism ( PE ) recurrent DVT . Despite standard care , 25 % 50 % patient DVT progress chronic post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) result significant disability , loss productivity , healthcare cost . The investigator postulate supervised exercise program patient acute DVT could increase low extremity venous flow , accelerate thrombus resolution , thereby decrease risk PTS . If patient unable perform exercise , NMES ( neuromuscular electrical stimulation ) use induce contraction muscle low extremity . Aim 1 test whether 3-month exercise program long-term clinical benefit acute DVT . The primary outcome measure Villalta score PTS VEINS-QOL score ( Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological Economic Study-QOL ) venous quality life 2 year follow-up . Aim 2 evaluate whether exercise therapy patient acute DVT enhances thrombus resolution . Aim 3 ass relationship PTS , venous hemodynamics exercise capacity .</detailed_description>
