	<brief_summary>Epidermal graft believe promote heal two mechanism : graft take promotion wound heal delivery growth factor essential element tissue repair wound healing.28 This study intend establish superior effectiveness epidermal graft multi-layer compression multi-layer compression alone , treatment venous leg ulcer . Millions Americans afflict painful , open , drain sore low extremity . These sore refer venous leg ulceration ( VLUs ) . Under best circumstance ulcer require week month heal . Not uncommonly wound care specialist see patient suffer year face amputation limb option alleviate pain . Standard care result heal 50 % venous leg ulcer 12 week . However , roughly half patient suffer venous ulcer require advanced therapy . Epidermal graft reconstructive option decade ; however , date reliable reproducible system harvest epidermis . The CelluTome® Harvesting System permit harvest epidermal blister graft patient 's bedside without need anesthesia . The graft easily transfer wound bed . In case study , epidermal grafting appear effective reduce wound size accelerate closure venous leg ulcer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluate Blister Graft Utilizing Novel Harvesting Device Treatment Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multi-center , randomize , control open-label study design evaluate safety effectiveness epidermal graft use CelluTome® system plus multi-layer compression therapy versus multi-layer compression ( SOC ) treatment venous leg ulcer . The study two phase : Screening Treatment . The Screening Phase ( 1 -14 day ) design determine whether subject eligible proceed Treatment Phase study consist series screen assessment design determine eligibility . At 14 day first Screening Phase Visit ( S1 ) , write informed consent subject obtain Investigator suitably qualify designee performance protocol-specific procedure . At first Screening Phase Visit ( S1 ) , Investigator select study ( target ) ulcer . Each subject one VLU select study ( target ) ulcer . In situation subject one VLU S1 visit , Investigator select large VLU meet eligibility criterion protocol study ( target ) ulcer . Patients whose target ulcer treat compression therapy previous two week eligible enter treatment phase inclusion exclusion criterion meet . If ulcer receive compression , patient place compression enrol study 14 day compression therapy . Ulcers decrease size 40 % screening period exclude `` rapid healer . '' The study consist 30 center United States contribute 10 subject per center order obtain 194 evaluable subject . The investigator anticipate 10 % drop rate trial therefore total 213 subject recruit . This trial employ adaptive design therefore enrollment number may reduce increase base plan interim analysis .</detailed_description>

Study ulcer present least one month prior initial screen visit , exclude undergone 12 month continuous high strength compression therapy duration . 5 . Study ulcer minimum 2.0 cm2 / maximum 25 cm2 randomization visit . 6 . The target ulcer treat compression therapy least 14 day prior randomization . 7 . Ulcer clean , granulate base minimal adherent slough randomization visit . 8 . Patient understands / willing participate clinical study comply weekly visit followup regimen . 9 . Patient read sign IRB/IEC approve Informed Consent Form screening procedure undertake . Potential subject meet follow criterion exclude enrollment subsequent randomization . 1 . Study ulcer ( ) deem investigator cause medical condition venous insufficiency . These may include , limited : fungal ulceration , malignant ulceration , ulceration due arterial insufficiency . 2 . Study ulcer exhibit clinical sign symptom infection SV ( screen visit ) TV1 ( Treatment Visit 1 ) . 3 . Known allergy component multilayer compression bandaging , tolerate multilayer compression therapy . 4 . Study ulcer suspicious cancer undergo ulcer biopsy rule carcinoma ulcer . The patient may enrol negative biopsy . 5 . Patients history two week treatment immunosuppressant ( include systemic corticosteroid ) , cytotoxic chemotherapy , application topical steroid ulcer surface within one month prior initial screening , receive medication screen period , anticipated require medication course study . 6 . Study ulcer previously treat tissue engineer material ( e.g . Apligraf® Dermagraft® ) scaffold material ( e.g . Oasis , meristem ) within last 30 day 7 . Study ulcer require negative pressure wound therapy hyperbaric oxygen course trial . 8 . Ulcers dorsum foot 50 % ulcer malleolus exclude . 9 . Pregnant breast feeding . 10 . Known history Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) history Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . 11 . Known uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus , measure HbA1c &gt; 10 % . 12 . Ulcers heal 40 % screen phase exclude . 13 . Patients investigational drug ( ) therapeutic device ( ) within 30 day precede screening ( i.e . S1 ) ; patient physician anticipates use therapy subject course study . 14 . History radiation ulcer site . 15 . Presence one medical condition , include renal , hepatic , hematologic , active autoimmune immune disease , would make subject inappropriate candidate ulcer heal study . 16 . Patients unable understand aim objectives trial . 17 . Presence condition ( ) seriously compromise subject 's ability complete study , know history poor adherence medical treatment .</criteria>
