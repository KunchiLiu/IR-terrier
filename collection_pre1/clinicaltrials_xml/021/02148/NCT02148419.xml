	<detailed_description>Between 2007-2010 Child Protection Team ( CPT ) University Children 's Hospital Zurich first Europe follow development maltreat child hospital sample ( Jud , Lips , &amp; Landolt , 2010 ) . Out total 180 child 2005/2006 CPT caseload , 42 child 2.5 16.5 year primary caregiver participate ( Jud , Lips , et al. , 2010 ) . The follow-up take place 2-3 year child report CPT . Non-CPT report hospital patient use control , match age , gender , nationality , medical condition . As major result , child 's health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) impair maltreated child compare control ( Jud , Landolt , Tatalias , Lach , &amp; Lips , 2012 ) . However , difference emerge self-assessment HRQoL child age 6 year old ( Jud et al. , 2012 ) . The assessment child 's HRQoL primary caregiver show significant difference maltreat child compare control age group . An essential lack understand child 's experience beliefs likely affect child 's HRQoL , may also contribute cur-rent future risk maltreatment ( Jud et al. , 2012 ) . Furthermore , maltreated child increase depression score behavior problem compare control . Detailed result find Jud et al . ( Jud et al. , 2012 ; Jud , Lips , et al. , 2010 ) . To address limitation , CPT University Children 's Hospital Zurich Children 's Hospital Baden AG propose prospective study baseline time report CPT two year follow-up . This study aim analyze HRQoL , behavior mental health maltreat child prospectively first provide data change HRQoL aftermath maltreatment . Based literature review finding previous follow-up study , assume follow hypothesis : - The HRQoL mental health child impair follow maltreatment even control others possible predictor impair HRQoL mental health . - We assume dose-response relationship severity maltreatment impair HRQoL . Multiple maltreatment hypothesize large impact single type maltreatment . - At baseline , HRQoL score hypothesize markedly low level . We assume slight increase HRQoL baseline first follow-up , continue increase second follow-up . - We assume differ trend outcome variable aftermath maltreatment intend analyze type trend associated cluster risk protective factor ( cf . Chaffin , Bard , Hecht , &amp; Silovsky , 2011 ) .</detailed_description>
