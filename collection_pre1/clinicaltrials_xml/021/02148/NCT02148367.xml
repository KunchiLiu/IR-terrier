	<brief_summary>- Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead cause death disability people age 45 industrialized country . Significant number US veteran war Iraq Afghanistan return TBI . However , date , specific neuroprotective treatment option proven clinical efficacy . - Erythropoietin ( EPO ) approve FDA treat anemia comprehensive preclinical data support neuroprotective neuroregenerative efficacy follow traumatic ( TBI ) wide range acquire brain insult . Injury small medium-sized cerebral blood vessel well recognize consequence TBI . EPO increase production endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) promote angiogenesis neovascularization TBI . EPO also promote neurogenesis improves functional recovery animal experimental stroke TBI . Neovascularization couple neurogenesis , augmentation process EPO may result lessened cognitive deficit . Neovascularization EPO may prevent post-traumatic deficit cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) , measure noninvasively use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . - This proposal randomize , placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial design obtain data effect EPO human persistent post-concussive symptom TBI . The primary objective evaluate effect 4 week administration recombinant erythropoietin number circulate endothelial progenitor cell patient persistent symptom subacute period TBI . This information guide design future definitive study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- The study population include 30 male female persistent post-concussive symptom continue 7 day TBI . Participants military service member civilians present outpatient clinical management TBI post-concussive symptom Center Neuroscience Regenerative Medicine ( CNRM ) -affiliated hospital . These include Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) , Suburban Hospital ( SH ) , Washington Hospital Center ( WHC ) . - Design : Participants refer NIH Clinical Center ( CC ) participate hospital recruit advertisement CNRM Recruitment core receive EPO placebo . Telephone screen carry determine tentative eligibility . At baseline visit , participant screen , consent randomized 2:1 receive either EPO placebo dose 40,000 IU EPO subcutaneously ( s.c. ) ( n=20 ) weekly 4 week placebo ( n=10 ) . Each participant 6 outpatient visit ( visit 1-6 ) perform NIH CC . Placebo active drug administer s.c. base randomization visit 1-4 ; blood collect EPC assay safety laboratory measurement visit . Brain MRI neuropsychological test perform visit 1 ( administer EPO placebo ) , visit 5 ( one week final drug administration ) visit 6 ( 6 month study enrollment ) . - Outcome Measures : - Primary outcome : ( 1 ) . Effect 4 week EPO administration number circulate EPCs patient persistent symptom subacute period TBI ( within subject comparison ) . - Secondary outcome : ( 2 ) . Comparison change number circulate EPC 's EPO placebo group . ( 3 ) . Effect 4 week EPO administration MRI biomarkers TBI recovery ( CVR hypercapnia global regional brain volume MRI ) . ( 4 ) . Effect 4 week EPO administration plasma biomarkers angiogenesis inflammation , stem cell factor ( SCF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , stromal-derived factor ( SDF-1Î± ) ; matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) . ( 5 ) . Effect 4 week placebo administration number circulate EPCs patient persistent symptom subacute period TBI . - Tertiary outcome : ( 6 ) . Relationship EPC level baseline 4 week neuropsychological performance follow TBI .</detailed_description>
