	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn U500 regular insulin effectively use treat type 2 diabetes . Most insulin treated patient type 2 diabetes take U100 insulin , require large dos ( &gt; 150 unit day ) may experience pain site injection absorption insulin unpredictable , thereby lead poor glucose control . To overcome problem , doctor sometimes switch concentrated form insulin call U500 insulin . U500 five time concentrated U100 insulin therefore delivers equivalent dose insulin much less volume . However , best use U-500 insulin certain . The investigator really sure long give dose effective patient require large dos ( &gt; 150 unit U100 insulin ) , sure often drug administer . In study , investigator determine effective two different dos U-500 regular insulin ( 100 U 200 U ) lower blood sugar long two dos last . This information help doctor develop well treatment plan patient type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>How Study perform : If agree participate , give chance come Masonic Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU ) University Minnesota tour facility day actual experiment . While MCRU , one investigator talk study provide information experiment . During week study , ask hold oral injectable non-insulin medicine use treat diabetes 1 week prior study avoid exercise 48 hour prior study . During time ask monitor blood sugar call investigator help manage sugar go outside target recommend doctor . On night study start , ask come Masonic Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU ) dinner ( 8-10 PM ) . Upon arrival two catheter place arm establish intravenous access . One used subsequent blood sample use infusion . We administer intravenous insulin necessary maintain blood glucose 100-150 mg/dL overnight . Blood sugar obtain every 15-60 minute overnight ensure glucose remains target . At 7 AM next morning , intravenous insulin stop . The study start give dose either 100 200 unit U-500 regular insulin subcutaneously random order ( like flip coin ) . Since insulin drop blood sugar , also ready start intravenous infusion glucose maintain blood sugar 100 mg/dl . To keep sugar target , blood collect every 15-60 minute measure blood sugar information use investigator figure much glucose give . We continue measure blood glucose maintain blood glucose without glucose infusion least 10 hour start experience hyperglycemia ( BG &gt; 150 mg/dl ) two hour discontinuation glucose infusion . At point , catheter remove discharged home . During stay MCRU , carbohydrate free meal provide start noon continue traditional mealtime thereafter duration glucose infusion . Non-caloric decaffeinated beverage available need . At completion study tell resume usual diabetes medication . Two four week later , ask hold oral injectable non-insulin medicine use treat diabetes 1 week prior second part study avoid exercise 48 hour prior study . During time ask monitor blood sugar call investigator help manage sugar go outside target recommend doctor . On night second part study start , ask come Masonic Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU ) dinner . Intravenous line place , intravenous insulin give overnight keep blood sugar 100-150 mg/dl , morning give dose U500 regular insulin receive first visit . Your blood sugar maintain 100 mg/dl infusion glucose . We continue measure blood glucose every 15-60 minute maintain blood glucose without glucose infusion least 10 hour start experience hyperglycemia ( BG &gt; 150 mg/dl ) two hour discontinuation glucose infusion . You feed diet first visit tell resume diabetes medication time send home .</detailed_description>
