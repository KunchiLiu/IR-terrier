	<brief_summary>Postoperative respiratory failure , particularly surgery general anesthesia , add morbidity mortality surgical patient . Anesthesiologists inconsistently use positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) recruitment maneuver hope may improve oxygenation protect postoperative pulmonary complication ( PPCs ) , especially obese patient . While anesthesiologist tend use PEEP high non-obese patient . While uncertain whether strategy use high level PEEP recruitment maneuver truly prevents PPCs patient , use high level PEEP recruitment maneuver could compromise intra-operative hemodynamics . The investigator aim compare ventilation strategy use high level PEEP recruitment maneuver one use low level PEEP without recruitment maneuver obese patient intermediate-to-high risk PPCs . We hypothesize intra-operative ventilation strategy use high level PEEP recruitment maneuver , compare ventilation lower level PEEP without recruitment maneuver , prevents PPCs obese patient intermediate-to-high risk PPC .</brief_summary>
