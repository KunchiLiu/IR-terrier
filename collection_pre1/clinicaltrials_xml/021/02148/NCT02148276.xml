	<detailed_description>Most clinical trial regularly monitor negative social harm experience participant systematic way . Participation HIV trial often place participant heighten risk oppression , discrimination , victimization . These risk may compound participant substance abuser . Although foreseen risk generally outline consent form monitor throughout study , many social harm unforeseen , consequently , discuss monitor . Without systematic monitoring , majority social harm likely go undetected . Recognizing high level social harm may arise result participation HIV vaccine trial , several National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) -sponsored group begin incorporate general assessment measure social impact research participation HIV vaccine trial . Although provided preliminary model monitor social harm clinical research , assessments several shortcoming limit reliability , validity , utility . In general , administer interview format may cumbersome research team . Furthermore , participant may feel uncomfortable reluctant report social harm directly interviewer , result inaccuracy underreporting negative event . Interview item generally address large class behavior rather specific behavior , reduce sensitivity construct validity assessment , question use across agency standardize . Finally , assessment include harm specific substance use , major risk factor HIV/AIDS transmission . The two-phased project aim improve collection social harm among HIV trial participant develop comprehensive , audio computer assist self-administered interview social harm questionnaire ( ACASI-SHQ ) allow researcher easily identify monitor social harm experience substance abuser participate HIV trial . The propose study proceed two phase . In Phase 1 , investigator develop ACASI Social Harm Questionnaire ( SHQ ) . In Phase 2 , investigator conduct control study evaluate acceptability , feasibility , utility construct validity . During Phase 1 investigator first conduct systematic literature review identify existing tool researcher currently use measure social harm impact experience research participant . In addition , investigator survey 100 researcher currently conduct National Institutes Health ( NIH ) -funded HIV-related trial involve substance abuser . The sample randomly select pool researcher meet criterion identify NIH RePORTER database . The brief telephone survey include question method use collect data social harm include specific question ask , mode administration , frequency assessment , perceive ease data collection , concern related assessment . During phase investigator also conduct focus group 10 former research participants gather information experience perceptions social harm HIV-related research trial . The research team collaboration multidisciplinary panel expert draft beta-version SHQ content format . The expert panel also assist identify optimal trial test finalize instrument second phase study . Finally , investigator conduct protocol analysis beta-version interview 20 individual currently enrol ongoing National Institute Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) -funded HIV prevention trial conduct investigator . This intended ensure item correctly similarly understood subject , provide insight good method phrase structure question response option properly convey mean . Upon completion protocol analysis , revise instrument finalize investigator , program ACASI format , beta-tested research team , critically review expert panel final programming ACASI-SHQ complete . During Phase 2 , conduct pilot study evaluate acceptability , feasibility , utility construct validity ACASI-SHQ . Individuals consent host study offer opportunity participate pilot study , receive manualized write informed consent procedure . We enroll total 80 individual pilot study . All participant complete two measure social harm monthly research appointment three month period . The social harm assessment ( 1 ) ACASI-SHQ develop Phase 1 ( 2 ) HIV Vaccine Trials Network ( HVTN ) Social Impact Assessment . At appointment , order instrument deliver counterbalance control carryover effect . At end Phase 2 , host study research team complete ACASI-SHQ Feasibility Acceptability Questionnaire . Additionally , PI Co-I conduct focus group research team collect qualitative data feasibility , acceptability , perceive benefit ACASI-SHQ information guide future implementation . The recruitment , study design , condition , arm , intervention , eligibility criterion section record reflect involvement 80 participant participate Phase 2 pilot test ACASI-SHQ .</detailed_description>
