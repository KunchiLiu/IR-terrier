	<detailed_description>Title : Clinical genetic examination dilate cardiomyopathy Background : Dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) serious disease heart muscle characterise reduced pumping function dilatation leave pump chamber without obvious cause like hypertension , ischemic heart disease heart valve disease . The patient often complain shortness breath , oedema , fatigability . The first sign disease severe heart rhythm disorder without precede symptom DCM rare cause suddenly unexpected death . DCM frequent reason heart transplantation prognosis severe though improve last decade implementation modern heart failure treatment . The prevalence DCM around 1:2500 Danish population disease often prevalent family rather spontaneous incident . Multiple screen study first generation relative DCM patient show 30-50 % case possible identify least one relative disease . The inheritance often dominant point report disease associate mutation 40 different gene . The clinical examination affect family show expression disease vary critical symptom change heart discrete change heart accompany symptom . Furthermore time debut DCM vary lot even within family disease manifest early childhood late adulthood . Newer investigation indicate subgroup approximately 10-15 % inherited DCM case high incidence fatal heart rhythm disorder thereby worsen prognosis . In considerable part family disease cause genetic mutation specific gene code nuclear membrane protein mutation label lamin A/C . The recognition linkage genotype clinical presentation disease ( phenotype ) , form foundation clinical algorithm make possible improve individualise risk stratification choice treatment . Status : There general consensus offer clinical screen heart disease relatives young DCM patient able detect disease symptom arise necessary commence early treatment thus avoid serious disease complication improve prognosis . In family clinical examination reveal relatives sign disease , unclear benefit continue control apparently healthy relative reveal possible later debut disease . The hope genetic investigation assist clarify question . If possible identify disease relate genetic mutation index patient DCM , would possible offer genetic diagnostics relatives hereby identify mutation carrier risk develop disease offer relatives relevant clinical control disease monitoring , relatives without mutation discharge without investigation . Until recently technically financially possible offer routine genetic diagnostics due large number disease relate gene unknown number unidentified DCM associate gene point . Fortunately revolutionary development DNA sequence technology last couple year make possible examine almost unlimited amount gene large patient cohort fast acceptable expense . The Technology call `` Next Generation Sequencing '' ( NGS ) , also use discover new disease associate gene genetic association study . Motivation : The main supervisor project , professor Jens Mogensen participate EU finance FP7 research project call INHERITANCE ( INtegrated HEart Research In TrANslational genetics Cardiomyopathies Europe ) since 2010 . The purpose project perform clinical genetic examination DCM patient . The project participants come 11 internationally recognise European centre lead Professor Arbustini Pavia Italy ( www.inheriatanceproject.eu ) . Due NGS technology possible make genetic examination 800 European DCM patient 42 known disease associate gene part project . Furthermore 34 candidate gene include theoretical point view could new disease associate gene . The Danish cohort contribute 140 well characterised DCM patient Funen Jutland . The raw NGS data perform group Professor Katus Heidelberg , Germany assess bioinformatics department clinical genetics Vejle process sequence data Danish patient . The first result process final result expect available summer 2014 . The Danish DCM cohort characterise contain 70 patient heart transplantation set apart DCM patient rapid fatal disease course . The patient cohort benign disease course could stabilise heart failure medication . On unique background possible compare genetic aetiology consecutively transplant patient non transplant patient hereby get impression relationship prognosis occurrence different mutation certain gene . Purpose : 1.To perform clinical examination relative DCM patient able : 1a . Investigate frequency familial type DCM 1b . To evaluate genetic examination property identify familial type DCM 2 . To compare genetic course DCM group transplant patient group non transplant patient , include association genotype phenotype affect DCM family . 3 . To investigate subtle change heart genopositive individual meet conventional diagnostic criterion evaluate advanced echocardiography . Hypothesis : 1 . It likely genetic investigation identify familial type DCM 2 . It likely difference genotype transplant group compare non transplant group DCM patient . 3 . It likely advance echocardiography use identify early subtle sign heart muscle affection genopositive individual meet conventional diagnostic criterion . Research schedule : Clinical examination index patient : Already 140 DCM clinically well described patient already include cohort data gather database . Clinical examination relatives index patient : 1 . Relatives get conventional clinical examination accord guideline , ECG echocardiography . If indicate MRI scan invasive investigation perform accord clinical guideline . 2 . Conventional echocardiography : Conventional two dimensional ( 2D ) , tissue Doppler Doppler echocardiography use evaluate systolic diastolic function leave ventricle outflow tract condition leave ventricle ( LVOT ) . The examination perform Philips Epiq7 medical ultrasound machine store digitally later blind analysis . The examination perform accord national guideline hence record parasternal long axis view zoom LVOT , parasternal short axis view aortic valve , mitral valve papillary muscle level . From apex record 4 chamber view , apical 2 chamber view apical long axis view . When record 2D , two consecutive loop save . Continuous wave ( CW ) Doppler aortic valve tricuspid valve , pulse wave ( PW ) Doppler LVOT mitral inflow also perform . PW tissue Doppler lateral medial mitral annulus perform . When perform Doppler examination sweep velocity 100 mm/s use simultaneous ECG registration . Five consecutive heart beat record save . Furthermore colour Doppler aortic- , mitral- tricuspid valve record estimate degree regurgitation every valve . More mild mitral regurgitation quantify effective regurgitation orifice ( ERO ) . Advanced echocardiography : Zoom leave ventricle frame rate 60-100 fps record apical 4 chamber , 2 chamber apical long axis perform save later blinded analysis speckle track analysis , evaluation torsion twist , global longitudinal strain ( GLS ) . Furthermore zoom view leave atrium 4 chamber 2 chamber view save 3 dimensional ( 3D ) view leave ventricle , right ventricle leave atrium perform . Time schedule milestone remain clinical examination : It expect relative DCM patient include offer possibility participate study . Experience show average 4 relative pr index patient offer clinical examination , thus roughly 480 clinical examination still perform . The clinical examination perform cardiology department Odense University Hospital ( OUH ) Aarhus University Hospital ( AUH ) collaboration DMSc Hans Eiskjaer . The examination expect complete September 2015 . The relative inform genetic result continuously , offer genetic counsel accord usual guideline . Practical precondition clinical examination perform : The necessary medical expertise necessary medical equipment available cardiology department mention . Genetic examination : In case presumable disease relate mutation find several family member family DCM , Sanger sequence relevant family member undertaken . The result use coherent evaluation estimate enough evidence classify sequence variation definitely disease related variant unknown importance . Time schedule milestone genetic examination : The final NGS sequencing result expect available spring 2014 . Sequencing family member expect performed simultaneously clinical examination . Practical precondition genetic examination perform : The necessary molecular biological expertise necessary equipment available clinical genetic department Vejle Hospital . Supervisors : Primary Supervisor : Professor , DMSc , Jens Mogensen , cardiology department OUH Co supervisor : DMSc Jacob Moeller , cardiology department OUH Co supervisor : DMSc Hans Eiskjaer , cardiology department AUH Ethical consideration : It likely participant study benefit result regard enhance individual counselling risk stratification . If participant wish know relatives genetic constitution respect consideration regard diagnostics treatment follow applicable international guideline . It supervisors one responsible project perception possible benefit , outweigh risk side effect study . The project approve Committee Health Research Ethics central Denmark region furthermore approve Danish Data Protection Agency .</detailed_description>
