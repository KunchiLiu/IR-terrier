	<brief_summary>Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) significant health care issue United States world . CLBP contribute decrease quality life , decreased function increase utilization health care resource . The cause CLBP tend multi‐factorial . Arthropathy lumbar facet joint think common etiology ( 15‐45 % ) . Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) medial branch nerve facet joint well‐established treatment modality use decrease facet joint pain . However , wide range temperature use ( 70‐90 degree Celsius ) . In addition , optimal temperature provide best patient outcome least side effect well establish pain management literature . This study determine lumbar facet medial branch RFA 90 degree Celsius provide overall pain relief ( i.e. , percent improvement ) , compare ablation 80 degree Celsius additional adverse event . Furthermore , ablation lumbar facet nerve supply 90 degree Celsius provide good improvement functionality level , general mood quality life measure VAS ( Visual Analog Scale ) pain score , Pain Disability Index ( PDI ) , McGill Pain questioner score Beck Inventory ( BI ) score receive ablation 80 degree Celsius . Also , associate less opioid consumption , additional unwanted adverse event and/or complication along less need repeat RFA procedure one year period .</brief_summary>
