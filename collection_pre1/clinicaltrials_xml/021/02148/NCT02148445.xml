We believe long-term NRT could reduce overall exposure cigarette smoke , reduce harm relate smoking , ultimately lead great quit rate . OBJECTIVES 1 . Compare benefit traditional smoking cessation ( SC ) versus guide maintenance therapy ( GMT ) NRT smoker COPD . 2 . Estimate rate smoke cessation patient-desired outcome base patient-specific characteristic treatment choice ( SC GMT ) . METHODS In study , randomize 398 smoker COPD one two treatment arm : 1 ) traditional smoking cessation ( SC ) 2 ) long-term , guided maintenance therapy NRT ( GMT ) . Participants SC arm receive standard approach smoking cessation , include smoke cessation counseling supplement combination NRT ( nicotine patch plus choice gum lozenge ) willing make quit attempt .

Outcomes measure 3 , 6 12 month post-randomization assess rate smoke cessation , number cigarette smoke , exposure carbon monoxide smoking-related carcinogen , clinical outcome include respiratory symptom , respiratory function , smoking-related hospitalization death . In addition directly compare outcome two treatment arm , novel classification regression tree analysis allow u identify subgroup patient likely benefit treatment allow patient estimate project outcomes give personal history choice therapy . PATIENT OUTCOMES ( PROJECTED ) This study show long-term NRT compare traditional smoking cessation program help smoker quit , reduce cigarette exposure , low exposure carcinogen , reduce risk death hospitalization . If hypothesis correct , program could dramatically alter treatment choice million smoker United States COPD frustrate attempt quit .</detailed_description>
