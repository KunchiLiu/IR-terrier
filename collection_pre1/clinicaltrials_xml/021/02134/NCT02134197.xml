	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate : - The side effect BAY1129980 give every 21 day different dose level . - Determine dose level BAY1129980 test future clinical research study . - Measure much BAY1129980 blood specific time administration . - If treatment BAY1129980 show effect reduce tumor growth . - If specific biomarkers might able explain patient respond treatment others . - If treatment BAY1129980 cause immune response body drug ( immunogenicity ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-escalation Study BAY1129980</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The relatively restricted C4.4a expression pattern provide target selective delivery cytotoxic drug C4.4.a-expressing tumor cell mean suitable antibody-drug conjugate . The subject population eligible current study subject advanced malignancy know express C4.4a , refractory standard therapy without standard therapy actively refuse treatment , would regard standard , opinion investigator , experimental therapy BAY1129980 may beneficial.Depending number dose-escalating step occurrence DLTs , plan number subject could vary.It expect 90 subject may participate dose-expansion phase study 6-9 subject may particpate dose re-esclation phase.The study assessment expansion phase study identical dose-escalation phase . Amendment # 3 include change DLT criterion ( hematological non-hematological ) allow frequent follow-up subject experience drug-related liver toxicity warrant dose reduction dose interruption .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>All subject must ≥ 18 year first screen examination / visit All subject must provide tumor tissue sample [ Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded ( FFPE ) slide ] archival tissue fresh biopsy collect Cycle 1 , Day 1 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 Life expectancy least 12 week Radiographically clinically evaluable tumor . In expansion phase , disease must measurable accord RECIST 1.1 . Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function Histologically cytologically confirm solid tumor know express C4.4a ( eg , carcinoma lung , head &amp; neck SCC , esophagus SCC ( squamous cell carcinoma ) , colon , ovary , prostate , breast ) refractory standard therapy , standard therapy available , subject actively refuse treatment would regard standard , opinion investigator , experimental therapy BAY1129980 may beneficial . A sign informed consent must obtain prior studyspecific procedure . Measurable disease least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension accord RECIST 1.1 Anticancer chemotherapy , experimental cancer therapy , cancer immunotherapy within 4 week prior first dose study drug . Anticancer therapy define agent combination agent clinically proven anti tumor activity administer route purpose affect malignancy , either directly indirectly , include palliative therapeutic endpoint . Skin toxicity include limited erythema , rash , ulceration , open wound still clinically present consider acute chronic . Subjects psoriasis severe skin disease ( eg , autoimmune skin disease , active erythematous skin lesion , etc . ) Serious , nonhealing wound , skin ulcer ( grade ) , bone fracture . Prior local radiotherapy allow complete least 4 week prior first dose study drug subject evaluable lesion previously irradiate Significant liver dysfunction determine ChildPugh score B C History symptomatic metastatic brain meningeal tumor unless subject &gt; 3 month end definitive therapy first dose study drug clinically radiologically evidence tumor growth . History clinically significant cardiac disease . Antiplatelet drug within 4 week prior first dose study drug . Antiplatelet drug define agent combination agent clinically proven antithrombotic activity administer route purpose affect blood clot ability subject . Participation another clinical trial receive active therapy within 4 week prior first dose study drug . Subjects CNS symptom undergo CT scan MRI brain exclude new progressive brain metastasis . Spinal cord metastasis acceptable . However , subject spinal cord compression exclude . Subjects severe renal impairment ( GFR &lt; 50 mL/min/1.73 m² ) dialysis . History organ allograft ( except corneal transplant ) autologous allogeneic bone marrow transplant , stem cell rescue within 3 month prior first dose study drug . Current evidence previous medical history ( ie , absolute risk latent infection ) hepatitis B C , active hepatitis , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Active clinically serious infection &gt; CTCAE Grade 2 . Major surgery significant trauma within 2 week prior first dose study drug . Substance abuse , medical , psychological social condition may interfere subject 's participation study evaluation study result . Subjects pregnant breastfeeding . Any condition unstable could jeopardize safety subject / compliance study .</criteria>
