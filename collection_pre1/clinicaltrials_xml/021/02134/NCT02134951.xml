	<brief_title>Biomarker Assessment Glutamatergic Target Engagement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study healthy subject ass feasibility Glx MRS BOLD fMRI measure ketamine induce change glutamatergic index . The investigator randomize 18 subject site . Subjects randomize ketamine placebo 2:1 ratio receive two drug challenge separate least two week . Ketamine challenge use induce `` glutamate surge '' within prefrontal brain region detect use neurochemical functional imaging technique . Each subject receive MRS BOLD fMRI challenge day . The goal pilot study assess feasibility propose ketamine challenge paradigm propose imaging-based biomarkers . Specific index use assess feasibility include effect size , cross-site cross-subject reliability , safety , subject tolerability similar study perform independently Yale UC Davis . Second information use select refine final study parameter subsequent full proof-of-clinical mechanism ( POCM ) study investigate effect Pomaglumetad ketamine-induced MRS fMRI effect .</detailed_description>
