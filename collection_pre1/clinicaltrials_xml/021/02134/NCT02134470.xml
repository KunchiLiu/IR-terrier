	<brief_summary>It generally accept chemical test biologic fluid objective mean diagnosis drug use . In recent year saliva attract much attention . The prime advantage saliva offer non-invasive , stress-free real-time repeat sample whereas blood collection undesirable , difficult expensive . In addition , know androgen testosterone assayed saliva , steroids pas endothelial-epithelial barrier passive diffusion . Nevertheless , correlation blood , urine saliva concentration well document . In recent review , point salivary hormone analysis could promise method sport medicine dope control , much work need use saliva sample area receive acceptance . According recent study increase testosterone concentration saliva significantly high alteration steroid concentration ( ratio ) blood urine . Saliva concentration may therefore serve screen parameter select suspicious case target evaluation ( e.g . IRMS ) . This may beneficial identify case transdermal administration low steroid dos . It therefore aim present project detect administer testosterone saliva compare level blood urine . The intention detect high dosage low dosage abuse testosterone , single-dose patch application . From practical point view saliva could offer complementary specimen pre-screening testosterone . So could assume salivary testosterone exceed upon plasma and/or urine level . So present study could base new method preselect suspicious sample testosterone abuse .</brief_summary>
