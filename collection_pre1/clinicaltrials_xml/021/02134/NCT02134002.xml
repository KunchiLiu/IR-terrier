	<detailed_description>`` Dopamine beta-hydroxylase ( DHB ) inhibition represent promise approach treat cocaine dependence . DBH enzyme responsible hydroxylation dopamine noradrenaline . Its inhibition suppresses noradrenaline secretion . In animal study , efficacy DBH inhibition psychostimulants use could link reduce dopaminergic response , possibly association post synaptic dopaminergic receptor hypersensitivity . In human , clinical efficacy DBH inhibition , particular follow disulfiram administration , process establish . However , particular mode action remain unclear : publication suggest increase aversive reaction cocaine , whereas others report decrease positive effect . To date , impact DBH inhibition dopaminergic response psychostimulants yet study human . This study represent randomize , double blind placebo-controlled trial . Thirty cocaine dependant patient include study hospitalization withdrawal . After inclusion visit , randomize receive disulfiram 250 mg/day placebo 15 day hospitalization . Main outcome criterion evaluate two TEP image session 11Craclopride , stimulation methylphenidate , 8 15 day randomization . The main outcome criterion variation linkage rate 11Craclopride nucleus accumbens baseline TEP measurement TEP measurement follow administration 20 mg methylphenidate . The primary objective trial show abstinent cocaine patient , DBH inhibition disulfiram induces reduce dopaminergic response follow methylphenidate administration . The secondary objective trial : 1. show methylphenidate stimulation induces less crave aversive response disulfiram vs placebo condition ; 2. show DBH inhibition disulfiram elevate D2 dopaminergic receptor availability ( absence methylphenidate stimulation ) ; 3. show availability D2 dopaminergic receptor ( absence methylphenidate stimulation ) link DBH activity ; 4. confirm abstinent cocaine patient , disulfiram reduces DBH activity v placebo ; 5. confirm subject weak DBH activity aversive reaction cocaine . Currently , disulfiram drug market inhibit DBH . Another specific DBH inhibitor currently development . It possible inhibitor could soon develop pharmaceutical industry area psychoactive drug addiction psychiatric somatic disorder . The development new therapeutic approach require good understand action mechanism .</detailed_description>
