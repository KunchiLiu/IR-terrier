	<brief_summary>The purpose study three-fold . We want ( 1 ) determine supplementation echinacea-based dietary supplement ( ECH ) would increase several blood parameter could affect oxygen carry capacity body , ( 2 ) determine ECH would increase VO2max trained endurance athlete , ( 3 ) examine effectiveness two different dos ECH outcome variable . We hypothesize supplementation ECH would increase oxygen carry capacity ( measure RBCs , EPO , ferritin , hemoglobin ( Hb ) , hematocrit ( Hct ) level ) , improve VO2max , maximum dose would effective increase outcomes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Echinacea-based Supplement Does Not Improve Markers Performance Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The supplement industry multi-billion dollar industry many product target toward athlete achieve optimal performance . Historically , endurance athlete use number method try increase erythrocyte ( red blood cell-RBC ) production attempt boost oxygen carry capacity perform well aerobic exercise . A number growth factor body stimulate RBC production include erythropoietin ( EPO ) . EPO primary growth factor promote formation release RBCs bone marrow . Although EPO ban substance , supplement company seek mean increase EPO production body order stimulate RBC synthesis . One natural product tot stimulate EPO production Echinacea find product EPO-Boost™ . Our global hypothesis supplementation EPO-Boost™ effective way increase oxygen carry capacity improve maximal oxygen consumption adult endurance athlete . We test whether EPO-Boost™ affect EPO level , number blood parameter , VO2max ( maximal aerobic capacity ) recruit 40 trained endurance athlete ( 20 male 20 female ) . To include , subject must already perform aerobic exercise least 4 day per week minimum one hour day . Participants randomly assign ( within gender ) either placebo ( n=20 ) supplement group ( n=20 ) . A 25 % dropout rate may expect gender , therefore recruit subject number 40 participant ensure least 30 subject complete study . All participant blind whether receive placebo supplement . Participants report Human Nutrition Lab ( HNL ) Exercise Physiology Lab baseline test . Height , body weight , body composition , blood sample obtain . Participants answer question regard current usual exercise pattern . These question address type , frequency , duration , intensity exercise . Finally , participant perform VO2max test Exercise Physiology Lab . After baseline test participant give supply either EPO-Boost™ placebo along extra capsule . The subject know whether receive product placebo . Participants also ask consume multivitamin pill daily entire 35-day intervention period . Finally , participant ask keep exercise log 35-day intervention document type , duration , intensity , day exercise order research personnel ensure exercise training change . The capsule exercise log collect day 14 35 . Blood collect 3 visit analyze EPO , ferritin , RBCs , white blood cell , hemoglobin , hematocrit , mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular hemoglobin , mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration . We assess change blood parameter VO2max determine whether 35 day EPO-Boost™ supplementation improve blood parameter maximal aerobic capacity compare placebo control .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Male female endurance athlete age 1844 Normal body mass index ( BMI ) 18.524.9kg/m2 . Individuals must currently perform aerobic exercise least 4 day per week minimum 60 minute session . They must also willing maintain current training regimen course study . Any change altitude study ( live training ) Recent altitude training use hypobaric chamber ( within last 6 month ) Any supplement ergogenic aid ( exclude multivitamin ) Any participant changing current exercise training program study ( include change volume , frequency , intensity ) If participant pregnant , breastfeeding , plan become pregnant study would finish Any blood transfusion blood donation past 16 week Any chronic disease cardiovascular disease , renal disease , diabetes Any condition affect ability perform maximal exercise</criteria>
