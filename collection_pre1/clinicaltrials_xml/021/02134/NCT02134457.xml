	<criteria>Bilateral ROP zone I ( stage 1+ , 2+ , 3+/ , APROP ) ROP central ( =posterior ) zone II ( stage 3+ , APROP ) . Zone I define twice distance optic disc fovea measure temporally , posterior zone II define three time distance optic disc fovea measure temporally . Legal representative designate willing able attend regular study visit study infant . Written inform consent participate study ( sign patient 's legal representative ) . Pediatric condition render infant ineligible antiVEGF treatment repeat blood draw evaluate neonatal ICU specialist study ophthalmologist . Congenital brain lesion significantly impair optic nerve function . Severe hydrocephalus significantly increase intracranial pressure . Advanced stag ROP partial complete retinal detachment ( ROP stage 4 5 ) . ROP involve peripheral retina ( i.e . peripheral zone II zone III ) . Known hypersensitivity study drug drug similar chemical structure . Contraindications intravitreal injection list ranibizumab SmPC . Systemic use antiVEGF therapeutic .
