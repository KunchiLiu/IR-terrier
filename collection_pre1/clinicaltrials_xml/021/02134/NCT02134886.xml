	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib hydrochloride treat non-small cell lung cancer spread part body remove surgery patient human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Erlotinib hydrochloride standard drug use treat lung cancer , however , yet know whether safe give erlotinib hydrochloride patient also HIV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Metastatic Can Removed Surgery Patients With HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) single agent non-small cell lung cancer participant HIV infection determine maximum tolerate dose erlotinib combination antiretroviral therapy participant population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy erlotinib advance non-small cell lung cancer person HIV infection . II . To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interaction erlotinib antiretroviral therapy person HIV infection , account nicotine exposure . III . To investigate effect therapy participant immune status HIV viral load . IV . To preliminarily evaluate know molecular phenotypic correlate improve clinical outcome associate epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) inhibitor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must know HIV infection histologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic unresectable ; patient eligible regardless tumor EGFR mutation status Participants may receive number prior line chemotherapy ( erlotinib EGFRtargeted therapy ) incurable nonsmall cell lung cancer ; ( first line platinumdoublet base chemotherapy plus switch maintenance chemotherapy count one line therapy ; prior adjuvant chemotherapy early stage disease count one line therapy 12 month great elapse completion adjuvant therapy initiation firstline systemic therapy ; le 12 month elapse , adjuvant chemotherapy count one line therapy ) PARTICIPANTS WITH NO PRIOR THERAPY FOR INCURABLE LUNG CANCER : trial eligibility restrict participant whose tumor harbor know EGFR activate mutation PARTICIPANTS WITH PRIOR LINES OF THERAPY : participant ( whose tumor harbor wildtype EGFR unknown EGFR status , EGFR mutations previously treat erlotinib/EGFRtargeted therapy ) At least 4 week must elapse since prior chemotherapy biological therapy , 6 week regimen include carmustine ( BCNU ) mitomycin C ; prior radiation therapy thoracic cavity , abdomen , pelvis must complete least 3 month prior registration ; radiotherapy site ( include bone brain metastasis ) must complete least 28 day prior registration Molecular characterization nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer recommend prior enrollment per standard care/institutional guideline ;
