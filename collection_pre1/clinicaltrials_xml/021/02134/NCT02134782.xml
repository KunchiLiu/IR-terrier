Guidelines National Comprehensive Cancer Network suggest patient , include child young 5 year age , routinely screen fatigue initial visit regular interval throughout follow anti-cancer treatment . These guideline also suggest fatigue manage accord clinical practice guideline . However , evidence demonstrate effective intervention fatigue child cancer scarce . Exercise effective intervention cancer-related fatigue patient age . However , patient receive intensive treatment may ill participate standardized exercise program . A unique potentially effective intervention combine exercise relaxation yoga . This randomize control trial ( RCT ) determine whether 3 week program individualize yoga associate less fatigue , good quality life ( QoL ) less systemic opioid use compare control program Apple tablet ( iPad ) game , music , movie book . This multi-center , parallel-group , randomized trial individualize yoga fatigue . Subjects inpatients 8-18 year age receive intensive chemotherapy cancer undergo HSCT expect remain hospital 3 week .

	<brief_title>Yoga Fatigue Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fatigue tiredness major problem child , adolescent adult receive intensive chemotherapy cancer undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . While exercise good reducing fatigue , patient often sick participate regular exercise session . A unique , potentially effective type exercise individualize yoga . Yoga particularly good since tailor less intensive depend child feeling . The investigator previously perform feasibility study yoga child admit hospital receive intensive chemotherapy HSCT find program yoga doable . The investigator also find child parent like program . Preliminary Data : The investigator ' team complete feasibility study yoga 11 child cancer HSCT recipients meeting similar eligibility criterion propose study . In short , result demonstrate feasibility individualize yoga suggested several design change enhance compliance outcome ascertainment . The investigator find mean ± standard deviation baseline day 21 proxy-report PedsQL MFS general fatigue score 46.4±26.8 55.6±15.5 . These score much low compare fatigue score observe two study healthy child score 88.8±12.3 89.3±13.3 described . This data suggest fatigue expect severe patient population . Objectives : Primary : To determine 3 week program individualize yoga hospitalized child receive intensive chemotherapy associate low general fatigue tiredness compare control intervention iPad game , music , movie book . Secondary : To determine 3 week program yoga associate well quality life less pain medication use compare iPad activity control program . Methods : This multi-center , randomize trial individualize yoga fatigue . Participants child 8-18 year age receive intensive chemotherapy cancer undergo HSCT expect remain hospital 3 week . Participants randomize individualized yoga iPad activity control program . The intervention individualized yoga program intensity level may change session . The control program consist visit game , music , movie book study-supplied iPad offer . Yoga session conduct day regular work week lead trained yoga teacher . In control arm , yoga teacher visit day offer child game , music , movie book iPad . Fatigue quality life measure parent baseline , day 10 day 21 . For subject remain hospitalized day 21 , offer alternate arm one week promote retention . The investigator intend record 10 % yoga session center use iPad videoconferencing equipment ( depend hospital 's policy ) ensure quality control monitoring session . Recorded file download secure File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) site . Any deviation protocol result feedback site within 1 week session ideally , within 2 day . The research team also routinely audit data submit ensure completeness data submission . The investigator plan enroll 210 subject 8 center United States Canada 4 year . Significance : Yoga potential significantly reduce fatigue , prevalent distress symptom , child cancer HSCT . The investigator assemble optimal team expertise track record accomplish important trial . This trial incremental critically important step program research design improve health child high risk poor quality life . Results may broad applicability hospitalize pediatric population potential change in-hospital care patient .</detailed_description>
