	<brief_summary>Diabetes multiorgan disease consider major health problem different society . One complication pain particularly extremity result process know diabetic foot ulcer . The diabetic patient subject many complication foot ulcer , many like chronic wound disease pressure ulcer ( bed sore ) . Routinely used medical measure diabetic foot ulcer depend nursing care take long pain relief . Among many test material work wound heal debridement , tissue oxygenation , skin transplantation , platelet-derived compound allocate pivotal position investigator tissue regeneration shorten wound heal process . Many platelet component procure platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) whole blood donation . Furthermore , require additional purification step diminish volume facilitate handling study . It mean platelet concentrate ( PCs ) may obtain lead concentrated platelet low volume . Two type granule platelet responsible storage many useful different growth factor : dense delta alpha granule . Platelet-derived growth factor ability growth differentiation numerous cell . Also , antibacterial effect growth factor report . To good efficacy comfortable utilization platelet , feasible form platelet gel apply wound site . This study double blind randomize control trial evaluate positive effect umbilical cord blood-derived platelet gel 244 patient diabetic foot ulcer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilization Platelet Gel Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study qualify patient ( base inclusion exclusion criterion ) randomly allocate three study group Stratified Permuted Block randomization method : group A receive platelet rich plasma gel , group B ( placebo ) receive platelet poor plasma gel , group C receive lubricant gel . All patient underwent standard long protocol knee osteoarthritis . All patient diabetic foot ulcer selected.On average , instance , amount platelet peripheral bloodis4 to6 time baseline level . Group A ( interventional ) : application 20-30mL gel platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) Group B ( placebo ) : application 20-30mL gel platelet poor plasma ( PRP ) Group C ( control ) : application 20-30 mL lubricant gel ( use typically sonography )</detailed_description>
