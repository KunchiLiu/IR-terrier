	<brief_summary>Study Description Purpose : The vestibular sense organs inner ear consist semi-circular canal otolith end organ . These organ contain specialized gravito-inertial sensor sense angular linear head acceleration . The input sensor require stabilize gaze position head motion , provide absolute frame reference respect gravity , thus provide vertical spatial reference body orientation balance . Disease damage vestibular sense organs cause range distress symptom functional problem people could include loss balance , gaze instability , disorientation dizziness . A novel computer base rehabilitation system therapeutic gaming application develop . This method allow different gaze head movement exercise couple wide range inexpensive , commercial computer game . It use stand thus grade balance demand use sponge pad incorporate program . Study Objective : 1 . Test therapeutic effectiveness TRP deliver home compare usual care deliver out-patient physical therapy clinic measure balance ( stand walk ) , gaze control , dizziness , health relate quality life individual peripheral vestibular disorder . 2 . Compare trajectory change electronic gaze performance measure obtain therapy session participant assign home Telerehabilitation . Hypothesis : Investigators believe Telerehabilitation platform cost-effective delivery rehabilitation . Additionally motivation perform tedious home program improve engage , fun interactive computer game part rehabilitation process . It hypothesize home game-based Telerehabilitation program result great improvement dynamic balance control , gaze control , dizziness , individual peripheral vestibular disorder compare typical out-patient physical therapy regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Protocol Design &amp; Methodology : This study adopt randomize clinical trial design . Recruitment screening ( include diagnostics ) coordinate co-applicant , Dr. Jordon Hochman , department Otolaryngology , Karen Reimer , Andrea Giacobbo , ; Physical Therapists . Inclusion criterion : Consist ( ) age 18 65 , ( b ) diagnose unilateral peripheral vestibular hypo function base detailed neuro-otological neuro-orthoptic analysis include binocular electro-oculography caloric testing , ( c ) home computer run Windows Mac OS . Exclusion criterion : Consist CNS disorder example CVA , Multiple Sclerosis , epilepsy , migraine , concussion recent fracture low extremity vertebra , advanced hip/knee OA , cardiac disease . Participants randomly assign either Control group ( active comparator ) Experimental group ( therapeutic gaming ) . Participants blind treatment . The treat therapist know receive home out-patient clinical program . Control group receive ; ( ) Herdman gaze stabilization exercise , ( b ) optokinetic exercise , ( c ) balance exercise use sponge pad . These exercise presently standard vestibular care . Participants attend out-patient physical therapy clinic week 8-10 week . The program also include 20 minute home exercise program prescribe four time per week . Experimental group : Will receive game-based rehabilitation program deliver home . The program gaze include provision motion mouse ( Gyration ) . This approach provide highly flexible treatment tool apply train gaze control , allow incorporation grade balance demand . The use HID compliant computer input device allow many different therapeutic exercise couple wide range inexpensive commercial computer game . Though initially design clinical use , easy use inexpensive motion sense mouse computer game intervention approach extend home setting . Many therapeutic exercise activity ( singly combination ) use practice variety gaze balance skill , , importantly , play fun computer game . Participants attend three clinical session time home therapy program establish training use computer , motion mouse game provide . Based clinical experience pilot data , three session sufficient initiate home program.16 The treat physiotherapist attend participant 's home ensure proper set-up operation TRP equipment computer application . Participants ask perform respective home program four time per week 20 minute per session . They receive phone call one week ass ability manage home program . Thereafter participant attend clinical follow-up per month . Recording Data Analysis The following information collect baseline prior start intervention ; age , gender , work history , occupation ( history disease/injury process , current medication . Assessor blind participant assignment . Primary Outcome Measures : 1 . Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance ( CTSIB ) ; performance-based measure balance alter sensory condition ) . 2 . Dizziness Handicap Inventory ( DHI ) , self-rating questionnaire base 25 question use quantify client 's perception dizziness impact life . Secondary outcome measure : 1 . Computerized Visual track test ( CVT ) , involve track bright visual target move horizontally left right computer display sinusoidal fashion several cycle , predetermine speed . The application record ( 80 Hz ) coordinate reference head cursor . Coefficient determination ( COD ) compute base total average residual difference trajectory reference head cursor motion . A value approach one equate excellent gaze performance . This test perform stand walk treadmill 0.9 m/s . 2 . Participants experimental group give visual tracking game application home use . The game software automatically logs reference head cursor coordinate ( gaze performance ) visual track task save data cod time stamp computer file ( anatomize ) . Participants ask play track task ( stand begin every training session . This involve three short test 45 second three track speed . The application automatically save logged data file , client either e-mail file investigator , save flash drive provide return follow-up visit . 3 . Spatiotemporal gait variable walk stability measure . This include examine whether exercise program transfer walk . A treadmill instrument pressure mat ( Vista Medical , CA ) use record vertical foot force step walk trial 1 minute 0.9 m/s , thus data 40 consecutive step . 4 . Participants ask complete log date duration exercise session , submit either paper version e-mail . Statistical Analysis &amp; Power Assessment : Descriptive statistic , include mean , standard deviation , frequency , percentage , use describe experimental control group baseline demographic variable . Differences group outcomes test use t-tests test independence . To achieve Objective 1 , test difference experimental control group continuous normally distribute outcome measure use analysis covariance , dependent variable post-intervention measurement outcome , covariate pre-intervention measurement , group membership between-subjects effect . Descriptive statistic , include measure skewness kurtosis , use assess departure assumption normal distribution response . If distribution contain extreme observation , robust ANCOVA statistic adopt . To test difference experimental control group discrete outcome , count number time participant feel dizzy daily activity , use Poisson regression model , dependent variable count number relevant event , covariate pre-intervention measurement , group membership between-subjects effect . To analyze longitudinal data associate Objective 2 , use mixed-effects regression model time random effect group fix effect . This model adopt account cluster repeated measurement within study participant use available longitudinal data ( i.e. , result case-wise deletion study participant due miss observation . Based pilot data primary outcome ( i.e. , CTSIB ) , conduct power analysis require sample size test difference experimental control group post-intervention measurement occasion ( i.e. , objective 1 ) . The pilot data show standardized effect size 0.80 . Assuming number model covariates 3 , proportion variance explain covariates 10 % , two-tailed test null hypothesis group difference p = .05 , sample size 46 require . We expect attrition rate 20 % study observation period objective 2 . Given , propose recruit sample N = 56 individual participate , equal number recruit treatment control group .</detailed_description>
