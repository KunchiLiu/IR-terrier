	<brief_title>OmegaChild - Omega-3 Supplementation Children Previously Treated Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rationale phase-1 trial find appropriate dose omega-3 future phase-2 study . The investigator aim define dose safely give child previously treat cancer , cause unacceptable side effect . In longer perspective , randomize control trial plan supplement give long period time , combination conventional cancer treatment . In preparation trial , dose find study design also evaluate compliance . Subsequently investigator hope supplementation beneficial child cancer treatment remission . The study population consist child judge complete clinical remission cancer . In phase 1 trial , one usually use healthy individual study subject , pediatric study allow . Therefore patient full remission choose study object , still come clinic regular follow-up . This group patient relevant study since represent age base-line diet , kind childhood cancer , suffer cancer many case still live severe consequence . The study design give five group eight individual different dos omega-3 adjust body surface area . The first group start dose omega-3 fatty acid similar generally recommend daily intake adult ( 200-400 mg ) . A dose escalation do perform group wise . The high possible dose study ( 2 x 3000mg/day dose level 3000 mg/m2 child 1.55 m2 , 3871 mg/m2 ) still low previously give maximum child study . The investigator keep escalate dose level within study long unacceptable side effect report . The administration do orally drink 200 mL omega-3 supplement fruit juice daily . It good fruity taste , low amount sugar , fish flavour . This facilitate treatment compliance child particular compare omega-3 give capsule - commonest choice study , less suitable child . Compliance important jeopardize try divide fruit juice less amount whole package , individually prescribe dose well actual amount ingest record exact calculation use analysis study . All study result primarily evaluate intention-to-treat basis , also calculate treated per protocol calculate exact dose consume 90 day give compliance term consume number fruit juice package .</detailed_description>
