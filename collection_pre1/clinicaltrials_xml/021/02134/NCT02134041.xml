	<brief_summary>We extend research Taiwan neurosurgery traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) database lead Professor WT Chiu Taipei Medical University recruit mild TBI ( mTBI ) participant ever register database . This database establish 15 year contain information 150000 patient . It one large TBI database world . TBI usually result traffic accident , fall violence event . Most victim young people victim suffer life-threatening mental-physical deficit . Mild TBI ( mTBI ) usually neglect symptom , sign mild mTBI patient usually obtain enough initial treatment . Therefore , mTBI might result long-term cognitive affective impairment , depression , indifference , anxiety , memory impairment , loss attention executive function . These late effect decrease life quality patient family also increase social medical burden . Recent epidemiology study point TBI would increase risk dementia , especially Alzheimer disease ( AD ) 2-4 time . However , association TBI severity , number repeat , genetic factor onset AD remain investigation . Amyloid-β ( Aβ ) plaques neurofibrillary tangle pathological hallmark AD . Accumulation Aβ consider first step pathophysilogy AD . Compelling research support TBI accelerate formation accumulation Aβ . These finding could link TBI AD previous research limitation . There lack mTBI pathology data impact mTBI Aβ accumulation still obscure . By amyloid-PET , could study effect mTBI accumulation Aβ tool could helpful understanding real impact pathophysiological mechanism mTBI AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct amyloid PET , cognitive examination APOE genotyping individual traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) 1 year , 5 year , 10 year 15 year ago . Age-gender-matched control without TBI recruit . The main aim study evaluate impact TBI amyloid accumulation brain . In mean time , also test effect APOE genotype amyloid accumulation TBI clinical relevants , term cognitive function .</detailed_description>
