	<brief_title>The Role Obstructive Sleep Apnea Children With Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NAFLD emerge one common complication childhood obesity . It associate predicts metabolic syndrome , independent overall obesity . Recently , study obese adolescent demonstrate increased ALT level associate deterioration insulin sensitivity glucose tolerance , well increase FFA triglyceride level . Further study show prevalence metabolic syndrome prediabetes increase increase hepatic fat content cohort obese adolescent . Moreover , investigator find fatty liver associate pronounced dyslipidemic profile characterize large VLDL , small dense LDL , decrease large HDL concentration . Fatty liver , independent visceral intramyocellular lipid content play central role impairment liver , muscle adipose insulin sensitivity obese adolescent . Thus , fatty liver disease may hepatic component metabolic syndrome . The synthesis triglycerides liver nutritionally regulate , formation simple carbohydrates require multiple metabolic pathway , include glycolysis pyruvate oxidation generate acetyl-CoA fatty acid synthesis , NADPH generation supply reductive power , package fatty acid glycerophosphate backbone , finally , lipoprotein packaging export triglyceride . Recent study show association fatty liver obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , condition estimate affect 27 % obese child . In particular , OSA associate ALT level degree steatohepatitis . Despite evidence importance NAFLD development metabolic disease , information concern association fatty liver OSA obese child adolescent quite sparse particular unclear whether OSA cause NAFLD two condition coexist obesity complication . In study investigator test hypothesis OSA one determinants hepatic fat accumulation . To prove investigator hypothesis investigator select group individual NAFLD OSA , undergo weight maintenance diet Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) 12 week . CPAP FDA approve represent lead therapy obstructive sleep apnea child age 7 40 lb . To evaluate effect CPAP intra hepatic fat accumulation investigator evaluate hepatic fat content MRI baseline intervention .</detailed_description>
