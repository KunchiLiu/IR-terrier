	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II clinical trial study well MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine work treat patient newly diagnose advanced colon polyp ( adenomatous polyp ) . Adenomatous polyp growth colon may develop colorectal cancer time . Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill polyp cell . MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine may also prevent recurrence adenomatous polyp may prevent development colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare immunogenicity week 12 MUC1 peptide vaccine adjuvant ( MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine ) ( administer 0 , 2 , 10 week ) participant history advance adenoma , randomize receive MUC1 peptide vaccine versus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability vaccine elicit long‐term memory response . II . To compare adenoma recurrence rate surveillance exam occur least 1 year 3 year week 0 vaccine administration - MUC1 versus placebo . III . To compare adenoma recurrence rate MUC1 placebo exclude follow type adenoma : participant adenomas = &lt; 5 mm ; participant adenomatous tissue may represent residual adenoma site previous advanced adenoma ; participant adenomatous tissue detect segment bowel previous advance adenoma . IV . To assess adverse event MUC1 peptide vaccine comparison placebo Parts I II . V. To assess patient report injection site reaction event Vaccine Report Card . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare anti‐MUC1 antibody titer time surveillance colonoscopy purpose evaluate anti‐MUC1 antibody response relation adenoma recurrence . II . To evaluate MUC1 expression baseline advance adenomas recurrent adenomas detect surveillance colonoscopy . III . To evaluate level circulate myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) vaccinate placebo group correlate anti‐MUC1 antibody level adenoma recurrence . IV . To establish biospecimen repository archive include live cell , plasma , germline deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) future immunologic ( e.g . MUC1‐specific T cell ) assay ( system biology approach detect differences responder non‐responders ) , test currently accommodate within budget trial . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Participants receive MUC1 peptide-poly-ICLC adjuvant vaccine subcutaneously ( SC ) week 0 , 2 10 booster injection week 53 . ARM II : Participants receive saline SC week 0 , 2 , 10 booster injection week 53 . After completion treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
