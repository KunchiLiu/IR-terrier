	<brief_summary>Recent study show baby hospital undergo average 4 5 painful procedure , heel lance , every day . Sucrose ( sugar water ) show effective reduce pain invasive procedure standard care painful procedure . The purpose study see least amount sucrose give baby reduce pain procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sucrose Practices Pain Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants NICU receive average 4 - 5 painful procedure daily diagnostic therapeutic purpose ; le half receive intervention manage pain . Both immediate long term effect unmanaged pain vulnerable infant report , include impaired brain development . To ensure optimal outcome hospitalize infant NICUs , crucial need minimize procedural pain associate consequence . Multiple clinical trial identify sucrose effective strategy reduce procedural pain infant . Despite inclusion neonatal pain guideline , standard , consensus statement sucrose inconsistently use . The under-utilization sucrose may explain knowledge gap relation minimally effective dose influence concurrent opioid analgesia , well short long-term effect repeat administration . Once infant NICU determine eligible study parent consent , infant randomize one 3 dose sucrose pain assess use validate pain assessment measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Infants 24 42 week gestational age ( GA ) birth , admit Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , schedule receive heel lance eligible . Parents approach participation within first 2 week infant 's life . Infants eligible Trial 1 , nonopioid trial , receive opioids within 24 hour prior heel lance . Infants eligible Trial 2 , opioid trial , currently receive opioid infusion . Furthermore , observation procedure time ensure additional sucrose dos provide within previous 4 hour . Infants exclude contraindication sucrose administration ( e.g. , unable swallow , pharmacologically muscle relaxed , heavily sedate ) due safety concern and/or inability ass pain accurately ( e.g. , unable clearly view infant 's face ) .</criteria>
