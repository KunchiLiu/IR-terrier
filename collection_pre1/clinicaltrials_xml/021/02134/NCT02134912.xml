	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well pemetrexed disodium without crizotinib work treat patient stage IV non-small cell lung cancer progress crizotinib . Drugs use chemotherapy , pemetrexed disodium , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Crizotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether give pemetrexed disodium effective without crizotinib treat patient non-small cell lung cancer progress crizotinib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1300 : Pemetrexed Disodium With Without Crizotinib Treating Patients With Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Progressed After Crizotinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy combination crizotinib pemetrexed ( pemetrexed disodium ) compare pemetrexed monotherapy measure progression-free survival ( PFS ) anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) + non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient achieve clinical benefit crizotinib monotherapy subsequently progress systemically . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) patient randomize receive pemetrexed monotherapy historical data . II . To assess overall survival arm . III . To evaluate pattern failure ( central nervous system [ CNS ] , extra-CNS ) combination crizotinib pemetrexed pemetrexed monotherapy ALK+ non-squamous NSCLC progression crizotinib . IV . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity result administration crizotinib pemetrexed compare pemetrexed monotherapy . V. To evaluate PFS response rate patient treat crizotinib follow progression pemetrexed monotherapy arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival ( PFS ) response rate ( RR ) ALK dominant ALK non-dominant patient entire study population within treatment arm . II . To evaluate magnitude difference outcome ALK dominant ALK non-dominant patient varies treatment arm . III . To assess blood biomarkers sensitivity resistance crizotinib pemetrexed exploratory manner . The blood biomarkers include cell free circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , micro ribonucleic acid ( microRNA ) treatment , treatment ( 2 cycle ) treatment progression . IV . To assess pharmacogenomic factor peripheral blood might affect drug level treatment outcomes exploratory manner . V. To assess proteomic/immunologic parameter might affect treatment outcomes exploratory manner . VI . To evaluate frequency individual mechanism resistance ( copy number gain [ CNG ] , mutation , alternate oncogene ) . VII . To identify alternative driver mechanism ALK fluorescence situ hybridization positive ( FISH+ ) otherwise unknown . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive crizotinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 pemetrexed disodium intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute day 1 . Upon disease progression symptomatic deterioration , patient may crossover Arm I . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
