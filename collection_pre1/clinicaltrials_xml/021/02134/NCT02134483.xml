	<brief_title>Parathyroid Allo-transplantation With New Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoparathyroidism clinical problem associate hypocalcemia , hyperphosphatemia , low parathyroid hormone level often manifest complication thyroid surgery . Direct injury , ischemia unintended excision parathyroid tissue common mechanism cause temporary permanent hypoparathyroidism . Temporary hypoparathyroidism ( &lt; 6 month ) develop 10 % case thyroid surgery nearly half develops permanent hypoparathyroidism ( &gt; 6 month ) ( 3-5 ) . Due rapid increase thyroid cancer case recent year , total thyroidectomy neck dissection perform frequently yield increase frequency permanent hypoparathyroidism . As current standard treatment , oral intravenous calcium preparation active vitamin-D3 use treatment hypocalcemia develop due permanent hypoparathyroidism ( PH ) . However , approach symptomatic treatment , must continue lifetime , cost high intend correct hypocalcemia . Besides , beneficial effect metabolic problem due PH . For reason , less costly effective treatment search 30 year parathyroid allo-transplantation ( PA-t ) introduce treatment alternative . Nonetheless , meet expectation completely . The main problem PA-t development immune inflammatory response graft tissue shorten life impairs efficacy treatment . Various kind treatment method immunosuppression , microencapsulation cultivation try overcome problem . Despite treatment option , convince result yet achieve . In literature , PA-t case often present case report , clinical series available . In study , aim present result new PA-t technique perform 10 patient diagnosed permanent hypocalcemia follow thyroid surgery benefit standard medical therapy</detailed_description>
