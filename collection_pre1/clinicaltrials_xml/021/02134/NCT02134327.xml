	<brief_title>Effect Dexmedetomidine Versus Midazolam Versus Combination Two Premedication Children Undergoing Bilateral Myringotomy Tube Insertion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children present ear tube surgery ( bilateral myringotomy ventilate tube insertion ) often suffer postoperative delirium recovery room . It hypothesize may result side effect premedication , midazolam . Midazolam frequently administer child preoperatively mean decrease separation anxiety . An alternative medication , dexmedetomidine , sometimes used alternative midazolam also effective treat postoperative delirium . In study investigator would like see fact measurable difference child receive standard midazolam dexmedetomidine . Patients would randomize one three group ( versed alone , dexmedetomidine alone , combination ) . Patients include would present BMT surgery ASA physical status 1 2 , fall exclusion criterion . Exclusion criterion would patient vital sign outside normal limit document research plan . Also exclude patient know genetic abnormality predispose derangement hemodynamics challenge airway . The anesthesiologist list team member one involve study would responsible provide standard anesthetic ( technique inhalational anesthetic agent intraoperative pain management ) variability would need take consideration assessment recovery room . The investigator researcher , anesthesiologists observer blind study . The pharmacy list patient consent , randomly allocate one three group . Only analysis investigator ( PI member ) know patient receive drug combination . Also , team member perform assessment three parameter ( 1 . Pre-op sedation scale , 2 . Mask acceptance score , 3 . Post operative emergence delirium scale ) , would good reliability . A briefing session perform prior study 's commencement showing picture reviewer agree upon assessment . The MOASS pre-operative sedation scale well mask acceptance PAED scale utilize validated previous study ( 10 ) , mask acceptance scale successfully utilized well ( 11 , 12 , 13 ) . The investigator goal decrease variability two member make observation . DESCRIPTION IN LAYMEN TERMS . Please summarize study less 10 sentence . Use language inform non-scientist understand . Please complete within space . Following obtained write consent , child present ear tube surgery randomize one three group receive premedication . One group current therapy midazolam , another group another drug dexmedetomidine , third group combination midazolam plus dexmedetomidine . Observers study ( investigator fellow advance practice nurse ) know group patient belongs , make three separate assessment : preoperative sedation , mask acceptance , postoperative delirium .
