	<brief_summary>Background rationale : Antimicrobial resistance global public health threat . An increase number Gram-negative bacteria isolates worldwide resistant virtually antibiotic include carbapenems . Although polymyxin current gold standard antibiotic treatment severe extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria ( XDR-GNB - defined Appendix I ) infection , resistance development therapy treatment failure common . Combination antibiotic therapy good vitro efficacy , formally test prospective trial . We conduct Phase IIB , prospective , open-label , randomized-controlled trial 4 major Singaporean hospital , balance treatment assignment achieve permuted block randomization , stratify hospital . There 75 subject per arm , subject comparator arm receiving standard-dose polymyxin B intervention arm receive second antibiotic , doripenem , polymyxin B bacterial isolate question . Subjects ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) additionally receive nebulized colistin . The primary outcome 30-day mortality secondary outcome include microbiological clearance , time defervescence , toxicity therapy , presence secondary infection due new multi-drug resistant bacteria length ICU stay . Plasma drug level measure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry . Hypothesis : The underlie primary hypothesis combination antibiotic therapy ( IV polymyxin B + IV doripenem ) superior mono-antibiotics therapy ( IV polymyxin B ) reduce 30-day mortality XDR-GNB infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial resistance global public health threat theme World Health Day 2011 . While issue case ( extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis , antiviral-resistant human immunodeficiency virus drug-resistant malaria ) access effective antimicrobial agent and/or high cost drug , small increase number nosocomial drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria , safe effective antibiotic available - next 10-year horizon , give timeline drug development . Extensively-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacillus ( XDR-GNB ) include majority six organism Infectious Disease Society America 's ( IDSA 's ) watch list global `` bad bug '' development new drug urgently require . These Gram-negative bacillus Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter baumannii . The frequently isolated organism Singapore hospital set XDR-A . baumannii point time . A. baumannii swiftly emerge past three decade major nosocomial opportunistic pathogen , cause infection debilitate patient especially intensive care unit ( ICU ) setting . It 10th frequently isolate pathogen US hospital rank among top 5 pathogen tropical hospital include Singapore , number antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii infection exceed 700 case 2006 . The major issue A. baumannii organism rapidly develop resistance many antibiotic - example , within single decade ( 1995 2004 ) US hospital , carbapenem resistance A. baumannii increase 9 % 40 % . XDR-A . baumannii ( defined A. baumannii resistant antibiotic - include carbapenems , beta-lactam/beta-lactamase-inhibitors , cephalosporin , aminoglycosides , fluoroquinolones , tetracycline sulphonamides - exception polymyxin tigecycline ) describe cause infection hospital worldwide . Mortality associate severe infection cause multidrug-resistant A. baumannii XDR-GNB range 30 % 70 % depend clinical set condition patient . Locally , mortality severe XDR-GNB infection approximately 40 % . From 2006 2010 , average 140 case severe XDR-GNB infection local hospital year , translate approximately 56 death infection attributable organism alone Singapore every year . Other local XDR-GNB include XDR-P. aeruginosa , carbapenemase-producing E. coli K. pneumoniae ( carriage New Delhi metallo-beta-lactmase-1 ( NDM-1 ) , OXA-48 Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapnemase ( KPC ) gene ) . These remain relatively rare Singapore , few 30 severe infection local hospital year . Treatment infection cause XDR-GNB present considerable challenge clinician . Monotherapy polymyxins - commercially available polymyxin B polymyxin E ( colistin ) - currently gold standard treatment severe XDR-GNB infection . However , associate significantly adverse effect may less effective clinically compare antibiotic , beta-lactams . In one tertiary center Korea , retrospective analysis suggest mortality XDR-A . baumannii bacteremia reduce colistin use treatment compare antibiotic ( organisms resistant ) . Individual treatment failure polymyxins report , either due development resistance vivo inherent heterogeneous polymyxin resistance - phenomenon many isolates appear susceptible drug may actually harbor polymyxin-resistant subpopulation . Tigecycline susceptibility XDR-GNB variable clinical failure also report , particularly bloodstream infection due low achievable concentration drug serum well potential development resistance treatment . This lead expert advocate combination antibiotic therapy alternative . In general , combination antibiotic perform good single agent polymyxin B vitro time-kill study animal model infection . In accordance publish report , also show various antibiotic combination demonstrate synergistic activity XDR-GNB . The effective vitro combination local XDR-GNB isolates polymyxin B + rifampicin polymyxin B + doripenem , additive/synergistic effect 50 % isolates without antagonism see isolates . However , uncertain vitro result particular instance directly predict clinical outcome . No rigorous clinical trial complete date exist result base case series retrospective review conflict . Against local XDR-P. aeruginosa , however , dual antibiotic therapy appear less promising , synergism achieve triple antibiotic combination test . Other vitro study suggest triple antibiotic combination may effective dual antibiotic combination . Nonetheless , difficult recommend clinical practice current time probable rise adverse effect versus uncertain benefit . Because increase number XDR-GNB infection locally worldwide , questionable efficacy current gold standard monotherapy treatment , paucity novel effective antibiotic infection foreseeable 10-year horizon , consistent report superiority vitro study , critically important combination therapy test polymyxin monotherapy rigorous clinical trial ascertain represent effective treatment strategy . It also important determine result multiple combination bactericidal test - like standardized susceptibility test single antibiotic - correlate well clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
