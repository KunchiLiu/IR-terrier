	<brief_summary>The overall purpose research study collect vaginal cervical biopsy healthy HIV negative participant . These sample enable investigator optimize laboratory method explore implementation challenge associate ex vivo challenge model . The first objective ass HIV virus best use model . The second objective determine best endpoint assay . The primary aim study collect adequate number cervical vaginal biopsy support optimization ex vivo challenge model . This ex vivo challenge model continue use topical microbicide clinical trial predict efficacy candidate drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimization ex Vivo Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development surrogates predict HIV prevention product safety efficacy high priority . An ex vivo challenge model one promising surrogate . Colonic tissue expose rectally apply microbicides vivo challenge HIV lab show significant reduction HIV replication compare tissue expose placebo gel . Currently , ex vivo challenge model ectocervical vaginal tissue develop Dezzutti lab Magee Womens Research Institute Pittsburgh , PA . Questions need addressed order optimize model include HIV virus appropriate use challenge tissue , qPCR appropriate endpoint marker infection , frozen tissue perform well fresh tissue challenge model . In study , collect vaginal cervical biopsy use optimization laboratory procedure . We obtain sample ( ) healthy HIV negative woman . Samples collect take Magee-Womens Research Institute laboratory specimen . Written consent obtain investigator co-investigator prior collection sample .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Age 1845 2 . Free abnormal vaginal discharge current vaginal symptom 3 . HIV uninfected . Note : woman recently participate recent research study HIV test result available study , suffice provide date test within 6 month enrollment visit trial . Otherwise , potential participant go test first study visit . 4 . Willing able give inform consent take place study 5 . Willing undergo pelvic examination genital biopsy 6 . Willing provide contact information 7 . Agree sexually abstinent two week begin one week prior enrollment visit 1 . Menopausal 2 . Pregnant within 90 day last pregnancy 3 . Hysterectomy 4 . Use diaphragm , NuvaRing spermicide contraception 5 . Reports course antibiotic therapy 14 day prior enrollment 6 . Known history platelet disorder coagulapathy . 7 . Participation another microbicide contraceptive study study involve cervical and/or vaginal biopsy within one month enrollment 8 . Use spermicide spermicidelubricated condom within one week enrollment . 9 . Use internal vaginal device product exception tampon within one week enrollment 10 . Any condition opinion site investigator would preclude provision inform consent , make participation study unsafe , complicate interpretation study outcome data , otherwise interfere achieve study objective</criteria>
