	<brief_summary>The use C1INH ( Berinert ) patient receive deceased donor kidney transplant high risk delay graft function ( DGF ) may show significant improvement outcomes post transplant compare patient receive C1INH treatment . Complement activation detect animal model human kidney ischemic reperfusion injury ( IRI ) inflammatory cell infiltrates . By block complement activation investigator hope improve kidney graft function post transplant recipient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Early graft function long-term effect graft survival . Poor early graft function DGF contribute decrease short- long-term patient graft survival , increase incidence acute rejection , prolonged hospitalization , high cost transplantation . Although multiple factor contribute impaired graft function , ischemia-reperfusion injury ( IRI ) underlie pathophysiology lead poor early graft function DGF . A &gt; 35 % incidence DGF remain constant time despite significant improvement immunosuppressive strategy patient management . This may due increase use kidney `` extended-criteria '' and/or non-heart-beating donor , even great rate ( &gt; 60 % ) DGF report . More 96,680 people currently wait kidney transplant United States ( UNOS.org 3/22/13 ) . Of 15,092 kidney transplant perform US 2011 , ~11,000 ( 62 % ) decease donor . Of , approximately 17 % expanded-criteria donor . The USRDS report 50 % patient wait list willing accept kidney expanded-criteria donor ( ECD ) DCD donor . From investigator previous study C1INH ( Berinert® ) prevention antibody mediate rejection ( ABMR ) , investigator note patient developed ABMR treatment C1INH , investigator also note near significant reduction delay graft function ( DGF ) due ischemia/reperfusion injury ( IRI ) ( ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT01134510 ) , FDA IND : 14363 ) . These finding suggest important role complement mediation IRI inhibition early complement activation use C1INH patient receive risk kidney IRI reduce costly often devastating complication kidney transplantation . In addition , numerous study animal model show dramatic improvement IRI model use C1INH . Complement activation detectable animal human kidney model IRI experimental data suggests use C1INH prior induction IRI significantly reduce IRI well inflammatory cell infiltrates . Based , investigator hypothesize use C1INH patient receive decease donor ( DD ) kidney transplant high risk DGF show significant reduction DGF improve outcomes post-transplant compare patient receive DD transplant receive C1INH treatment . Here , investigator propose investigate application pre-operative post-transplant dos C1INH ( Berinert® ) vs. placebo adult subject receive DD renal allograft consider high-risk IRI DGF . The investigator hypothesize C1INH treat patient demonstrate improve function kidney allograft compare placebo , equivalence safety . The primary objective study : Using double blind , placebo control format , investigator : 1 . Evaluate compare safety C1INH ( 50 U/kg , round near 500unit ) administer pre-transplant 24 hrs post-transplant recipient kidney allograft high risk IRI decease donor . The secondary objective : 1 . On basis safety efficacy , determine appropriate Berinert® study dose Phase III investigation , 2 . Determine appropriate endpoint choice Phase III investigation .</detailed_description>
