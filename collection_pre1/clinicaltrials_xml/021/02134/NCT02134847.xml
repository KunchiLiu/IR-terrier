	<brief_summary>In proposal , seek address conclusively two knowledge gap : 1 ) lack data relationship PGY2+ ( post graduate year 2 ) sleep deprivation patient safety ; 2 ) lack data relationship resident sleep deprivation preventable patient injury . Through Clinical Translational Science Award ( CTSA ) -funded Sleep Research Network , large federally-funded sleep science network U.S. , propose conduct multi-center randomize crossover trial six pediatric ICUs staff PGY2 PGY3 resident . We compare rate serious error ( i.e. , rate harmful serious medical error due cause , include limited fatigue-related error , handoff error , provider knowledge deficit ) sleep circadian science-based ( SCS ) intervention schedule traditional schedule include frequent shift 24 hour longer . Our specific aim : 1 . To test hypothesis PGY2 &amp; 3 resident work SCS intervention schedule make significantly few harmful medical error ( preventable adverse event ) serious medical error ( near miss ) care ICU patient resident work traditional schedule ; ( primary endpoint : resident-related preventable adverse event near miss ) 2 . To test hypothesis rate harmful medical error ( preventable adverse event ) serious medical error ( near miss ) throughout ICU ( i.e. , involve involve resident ) low ICUs PGY2 &amp; 3 resident work SCS intervention schedule resident work traditional schedule ; ( major secondary endpoint : ICU-wide preventable adverse event near miss ) 3 . To test hypothesis resident physician ' risk neurobehavioral performance failure motor vehicle crash - assess simple visual reaction time task [ Johns Drowsiness Score ( JDS ) Psychomotor Vigilance Task ( PVT ) lapse ] - low SCS intervention schedule traditional schedule . ( major secondary endpoint : resident neurobehavioral performance predict drive safety )</brief_summary>
