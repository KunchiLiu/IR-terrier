	<brief_title>Methylation Status BDNF Gene After Dialectical Behavior Therapy BPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) chronic debilitate syndrome associate considerable morbidity , mortality , high rate medical psychiatric utilization service . The prevalence BPD around 1 % -2 % general population . However , suicidality self-injury common , estimate 69-80 % patient BPD attempt suicide high percentage engage nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior . The rate complete suicide group appropriately 10 % . Several Western literature demonstrate therapeutic effect dialectical behavior therapy ( DBT ) patient BPD . However , research focus find biological observable marker purpose monitoring treatment effect start draw attention . Recent research implicate brain-derived neutrophilic factor ( BDNF ) might natural candidate biological correlate early life stress . The alteration level BDNF BDNF methylation BPD patient compare general population , pre- post- psychotherapeutic treatment might indicate consequence epigenetic modification associate stressful experience suicide , may later able explain psychopathology neurodevelopment BPD . Such study investigate association change methylation level , change depressive score , hopelessness score , impulsivity , effect psychotherapy never do Asian country . Little known possible epigenetic change relate Western psychological therapy BPD patient Asia . Method : The investigator therefore propose current randomize control trial test whether epigenetic change happen DBT treatment , treatment usual ( TAU ) . Proportions suicide non-suicidal self injurious behavior follow test change BDNF methylation level . Other clinical symptom assess , include suicidality , depression , hopelessness , quality life , disability , service utilization , function . Inclusion criterion subject fulfill Diagnostic Statistic Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) criterion BPD , 20-60 year age , sign informed consent , least two episode suicidal non-suicidal self-injurious episode past 5 year , least one 3 month precede enrollment . The exclusion criterion include psychotic disorder , bipolar I disorder , severe physical illness , mental retardation . Outcome measure blood sample obtain pre-treatment , 4-month , 8-month post-treatment ( 12-month ) 1-year protocol . Using semi-structured interview battery self-report form , range symptom behavior associate BPD assess . Outcome variable evaluate blinded assessor . In first third year study , investigator aim recruit 180 study control subject , gather information , collect biological sample , give one-year psychotherapy per subject , evaluate result , , treatment . The TAU group would receive therapy patient could get exclude DBT . In addition , also hope explore effect know unknown drug associate project ( decitabine , azacitidine , trichostatin A , valproic acid ) change DNA methylation cell level . As consequence , consider potential development biological correlate medication future evidence treatment BPD , research expect take least three year investment . Primary hypothesis : Responders participant receive DBT show great decrease BDNF methylation level patient receive TAU . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Participants receive DBT great reduction frequency severity suicidal non-suicidal self-injurious behavior different level BDNF methylations compare n't much improvement . 2 . Changes score frequency borderline personality symptom , depression , psychological symptom , suicidal ideation , hopelessness , disability , quality life measure associate change level BDNF proteins BDNF methylations . 3 . Known unknown epigenetic drug also associate alteration methylation status patient BPD cell level .</detailed_description>
