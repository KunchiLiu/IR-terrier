	<brief_summary>This trial aim provide prospective evidence safety efficacy mannitol 400 mg b.i.d . subject age 18 year . We hypothesize inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.i.d . increase mean change baseline FEV1 ( mL ) compare control 26-week treatment period adult subject cystic fibrosis . Any improvement FEV1 consider clinically meaningful , however , trial set threshold 80 mL purpose determine appropriate sample size statistical power retain trial feasibility orphan disease population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Trial Inhaled Mannitol Adult Cystic Fibrosis Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , parallel arm , control , multicenter , interventional clinical trial . Potential subject sign inform consent form ( ICF ) assess eligibility . After satisfy inclusion &amp; exclusion criterion , subject give mannitol tolerance test ( MTT ) . Those subject pass MTT randomize receive inhale mannitol ( 400 mg b.i.d . ) control b.i.d . period 26-weeks .</detailed_description>
