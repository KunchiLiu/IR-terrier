	<brief_title>Ability Bedside Ultrasound Predict Progression Severity Disease Dengue Fever</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dengue fever various level severity , mild disease severe hemorrhagic complication shock . Dengue endemic world-wide find United States . The mortality dengue fever high 15-20 % , nearly 22,000 death annually , child ( Reddy , 2013 ) . There reliable way immediately predict child present fever Dengue fever outbreak progress severe disease . Some child dengue fever improve limited clinical intervention , others require intensive therapy . Limited healthcare resource develop country make decision treatment disposition difficult many child poor clinical decision increase morbidity mortality . In developed country United States , early identification patient dengue fever potential identify child may benefit early intervention . Identifying patient first step explore early therapy effect mortality . Previous research demonstrate intrathoracic/ peritoneal fluid gallbladder wall thickening associate worsen clinical prognosis hospitalize patient dengue fever ( Michels , 2013 ) . We explore early presentation emergency department outpatient department . Our hypothesis presence gallbladder wall thicken and/or pleural effusion child correlate progression Dengue hemorrhagic fever Dengue shock . In addition , hypothesize sonographic image pediatric patient present emergency department fever Dengue fever outbreak change management disposition . Our specific aim 1 ) compare accuracy bedside ultrasound detection intra-thoracic fluid , peritoneal free fluid , gallbladder wall thicken physical exam versus physical exam alone diagnose dengue fever 2 ) determine association sonographic feature dengue ( intra-thoracic fluid gallbladder wall thicken ) clinical outcome child dengue fever . This study prospective observational clinical study emergency department , inpatient ward , intensive care unit , outpatient department Angkor Hospital Children Siem Reap , Cambodia . Study subject include child 16 year less , present annual Dengue Fever outbreak suspect Dengue fever . Subjects include child acute febrile illness , two following : headache , retro-orbital pain , myalgia , arthralgia , rash , hemorrhagic manifestation , plasma leakage ( i.e . shortness breath , abdominal distention/pain ) . Clinicians determine clinical suspicion dengue , intend therapeutic intervention disposition follow history physical exam ultrasound image . Study personnel perform diagnostic bedside ultrasound image gallbladder peritoneal pleural space ( FAST exam ) clinician determine clinical suspicion Dengue , intend therapeutic intervention disposition . Patients follow determine clinical outcome , therapeutic intervention disposition . The primary endpoint progression disease . The secondary endpoint change clinical care provide emergency department relate ultrasound imaging .</detailed_description>
