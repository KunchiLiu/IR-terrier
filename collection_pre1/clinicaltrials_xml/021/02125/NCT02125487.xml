	<detailed_description>Breast cancer Lebanese national problem . Campaigns mammography screen effective recommendation breast examination screen breast tumor lack . On one hand , Lebanese population culturally diverse , woman 's belief range liberal extremely conservative . On hand , Clinical Breast Examination ( CBE ) traditionally taught medicine III student lecture , follow practice low-fidelity breast model . The opportunity clinically practice CBE depend patient availability willingness examine student . This limited Lebanese woman 's cultural religious belief . Little known effect patient cultural practice efficacy CBE . In project , focus need effective educational tool teach CBE physicians-in-training . The propose teaching method study hybrid simulation : breast model jacket ( simulator ) worn train actress ( standardized patient , SP ) . In study , compare standardize educational tool traditional teaching method consist lecture train low-fidelity ( unrealistic ) breast model desk ( SP ) . We hypothesize use hybrid simulation tool , compare traditional teaching method , result complete CBE , good lesion detection improve culturally sensitive communication skill term awareness , ability deal , cultural difference relate breast examination . In order , evaluate medical student ' performance examine attitude cultural competency perform CBEs 3 culturally different standardized patient use hybrid simulation scenario . Through experimental design minimize bias related selection student ( randomize control ) , compare hybrid simulation ( intervention ) low-fidelity simulation ( control ) teach CBE . Medicine-III student rotate Obstetrics Gynecology department American University Beirut Medical Center ( AUBMC ) ask participate ; free refuse without effect grade rotation . The student assess Objective Structured Clinical Examination ( OSCE ) set similar usual oral clinical exam contributory academic evaluation Faculty Medicine . The OSCE set include encounter 3 culturally different Standardized Patients ( 1 `` outgo '' woman , 1 `` chador '' , 1 moderately conservative woman ) . The assessment tool questionnaires either objective ( fill SP ) self-reporting ( filled student ) ( 1 ) meet learn objective , ( 2 ) student 's attitude , ( 3 ) clinical cultural competency .</detailed_description>
