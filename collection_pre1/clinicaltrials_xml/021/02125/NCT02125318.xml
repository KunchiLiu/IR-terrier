	<brief_summary>Anagrelide drug show slow fast platelet make bone marrow , approve FDA treat high platelet count patient bone marrow disorder . Anagrelide Controlled Release ( `` CR '' ) new preparation anagrelide make dissolve slowly currently market version drug . Because , anagrelide take blood slowly . Researchers think slow release drug could help low side effect might cause high blood level drug dissolve quickly currently market product . The main purpose study see well Anagrelide CR control platelet count patient high platelet level , see kind side effect cause , measure blood level drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Anagrelide Controlled Release ( GALE-401 ) Patients With High Platelet Counts Due Bone Marrow Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm , multicenter , Phase 2 study anagrelide CR subject MPN-related thrombocytosis . Eligible subject include previously treat thrombocytosis receive platelet-lowering therapy least 2 week prior study treatment . Each subject receive anagrelide CR start dose 0.5 mg b.i.d . ( 1.0 mg/day ) , anticipate continue study treatment least 24 week . Subjects achieve clinical benefit opinion Investigator tolerate study drug may continue study treatment develop unacceptable toxicity discontinuation criterion meet . The primary efficacy endpoint proportion subject achieve platelet response ( CR PR ) . The safety tolerability study treatment assess frequency severity adverse event determine NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v 4.03 . The PK profile anagrelide CR assess initial ( 0.5mg b.i.d . ) final titrate dose level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Provide write informed consent prior study specific procedure 2 . Male female patient age ≥ 18 year 3 . Diagnosis myeloproliferative neoplasm ( i.e. , chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) , polycythemia vera ( PV ) , primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) ) determine treat physician , base 2008 World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification myeloid malignancies 4 . Baseline platelet count ≥600 x 10e9/L determined two occasion least 14 day apart prior first dose study drug 5 . Requirement platelet reduction therapy assess Investigator 6 . Currently receive therapy specifically intend reduce platelet count 7 . For patient ET , prior platelet lower therapy ( e.g. , hydroxyurea , anagrelide interferon ) may administer within 2 week prior first dose study drug . For patient MPN diagnose ET , concurrent antiMPN treatment permit provided treatment administer stable dos least 4 week prior first dose study drug . Examples permit medication include limited hydroxyurea PV , ruxolitinib MF , imatinib CML . All patient must discontinue anagrelide least 2 week prior first dose study drug . EXCEPTION : busulfan , melphalan phosphate P32 must discontinue least 4 week prior first dose study drug . 8 . Adequate hepatic function define bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN , INR ≤1.5 x ULN , albumin &gt; 3.5 g/dL , ALT &lt; 3.0 x ULN , AST &lt; 3.0 x ULN 9 . If female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e . post menopausal ( define &gt; 12 month since last menstrual period ) surgically sterilize ( i.e . tubal ligation hysterectomy least 6 month prior screen ) , childbearing potential , must pregnant nursing 10 . Males females child bearing must agree use acceptable form birth control 28 day follow last dose study drug 1 . Other MPN diagnosis specifically include : Chronic neutrophilic leukemia , chronic eosinophilic leukemia , mastocytosis , unclassifiable MPNs 2 . Previously find refractory anagrelide therapy ( i.e. , failure achieve platelet count &lt; 600 x 10e9/L reason anagreliderelated toxicity ) 3 . History coronary artery disease require revascularization procedure within 3 month prior screen 4 . Left bundle branch block sustain ventricular tachycardia ( &gt; 30 second ) evident 12lead ECG screen 5 . Tachycardia define rest heart rate &gt; 100 bpm screen 6 . Unstable angina ( characterize increasingly frequent episode modest exertion rest , worsen severity , prolonged duration ) within 3 month prior screen 7 . Transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) stroke within 3 month prior screen 8 . Unstable clinically significant concurrent medical condition would , opinion Investigator , jeopardize safety subject and/or compliance protocol . 9 . Current alcohol drug abuse , significant medical condition , opinion Investigator , may impair compliance requirement protocol 10 . History allergic hypersensitivity anagrelide component formulation 11 . Administration Type 3 phosphodiesterase ( PDE3 ) inhibitor ( e.g. , inamrinone , cilostazol , milrinone ) within 2 week prior initiate study treatment 12 . Administration investigational product within 4 week prior initiate study treatment 13 . History intolerance PDE3 inhibitor</criteria>
