D1.6 Next , participant practice procedure determine maximal voluntary isometric strength ( MVC ) plantar flexor muscle group . Participants seat specially design chair hip angle 90 degree . A series 3 maximal , all-out isometric contraction ( contraction stationary object muscle shorten lengthen ) perform . Each contraction last approximately 3 second . Participants give verbal encouragement throughout contraction . Muscle activation ( amount percentage total muscle mass plantar flexor person able use contraction ) isometric contraction assess use interpolated-twitch technique ( ITT ) . This technique involve apply electrical current muscle via stimulation tibial motor axon ( nerve ) contract determine muscle able generate additional force , beyond participant generate . The force stimulation compare force generate relaxed , non-contracting muscle determine percentage muscle participant active contraction . To perform ITT stimulate electrode place proximal patella behind knee tibial nerve . Participants receive brief ( 10 millisecond ) high intensity stimulation muscle contraction , 4 6 second follow contraction ( muscle relax ) . The MVC well ITT determine right left calf . Test Day 2 : participant report sensory muscle function lab approximately 48 hour follow test day 1 15 minute session . D2.1 MVC muscle activation plantar flexor practice describe previously . Test Day 3 : participant report sensory muscle function lab approximately 48 hour follow test day 2 15 minute session .
