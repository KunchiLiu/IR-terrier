	<brief_summary>This study divide development two complementary work package justify need incorporate new strategy optimize rehabilitation outcome stroke patient . The general objective : 1 ) determine prevalence respiratory muscle dysfunction stroke patient ; 2 ) identify existence potential amino acid marker increase risk muscle dysfunction suffer stroke ; 3 ) evaluate effectiveness incorporate respiratory muscle train innovative adjuvant therapy stroke rehabilitation program may decrease incidence morbidity mortality medium long term ; 4 ) quantify potential impact respiratory muscle training cost care stroke patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Muscle Training Subacute Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause morbidity mortality worldwide . It determine substantial socioeconomic burden . Stroke lead varying degree oropharyngeal dysphagia ( 25-85 % patient ) respiratory muscle dysfunction associate increase medical complication bronchoaspiration pneumonia , malnutrition death . The respiratory muscle dysfunction common functional abnormality chronic respiratory disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , heart failure , multiple sclerosis show modify expect survival . Dysphagia present significant proportion patient admit Rehabilitation ( 85 % depend series ) subacute phase stroke . There drug able restore swallow function inspiratory expiratory muscle function patient . Consequently , neurological rehabilitation mainstay treatment disorder . Amino acid ( AA ) essential proper protein synthesis . Skeletal muscle represent large reserve body AA , may use accord metabolic need . Within group compound , involved muscle metabolism glutamate , aspartate , asparagine , valine , leucine isoleucine . A pathobiological association decrease muscle glutamate diaphragm dysfunction patient chronic respiratory disease demonstrate chronic respiratory patient . Moreover , glutamate level diaphragm restore result muscle training , play decisive role precursor certain AA ( glutamine alanine ) , glutathione patient COPD . Other study define glutamine may biomarker train response healthy individual . Several publication reflect decrease glutamine glutamate result different disease case try supplement deficit . Muscle dysfunction define function impairment ( decrease strength and/or resistance ) muscle whose main consequence muscle fatigue . Although exercise training use successfully restore function patient chronic illness frailty , little evidence beneficial effect overall muscle training stroke patient . Regarding peripheral muscle , high-intensity training improve strength endurance low limb muscle ( paretic non paretic ) stroke patient . Dysfunction diaphragm respiratory muscle important clinical implication . It associate susceptibility hypercapnic ventilatory failure , ineffective cough , even high incidence repeat hospital admission mortality . Therefore , respiratory muscle weakness describe stroke patient justifies need train respiratory muscle general exercise ( bicycle , leg , arm ) able induce overload enough achieve training effect respiratory muscle .</detailed_description>
