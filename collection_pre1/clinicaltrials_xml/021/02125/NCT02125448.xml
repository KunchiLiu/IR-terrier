	<brief_summary>Rationale : For resectable esophageal cancer standard therapy 5 week neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( nCRT ) follow surgery 6-8 week afterwards . Surgery perform independent response nCRT associate substantial morbidity . A pathological complete response ( pCR ) nCRT see 28-34 % patient . Pathological non-responders ( pNR ) probably benefit nCRT expose toxicity delay surgical therapy inevitably occur group . Early identification non-responders nCRT would allow individualized decision make continuation discontinuation nCRT . Furthermore , tool desirable accurately assess treatment response nCRT identify patient complete response . Studies rectal cancer report tumor resection could omit patient persist clinical complete response 12 month . Also , esophageal cancer study , complete responder surgical non-surgical treatment group comparable overall survival . These finding indicate possibility perform nCRT sole treatment patient complete response . Conversely , residual tumor demonstrate , support decision move surgery . Objective : Diagnostic study ass distinct combine value anatomical functional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) combine 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography compute tomography ( PET-CT ) evaluation treatment response nCRT patient esophageal cancer . Study design : Multi-center diagnostic study investigate value MRI PET-CT imaging , nCRT assessment response nCRT resectable esophageal cancer . Imaging response measurement compare histopathological tumor regression grade ( TRG ) resection specimen gold standard . Study population : 50 patient ( &gt; 18 year ) present UMC Utrecht M.D . Anderson Cancer Center resectable esophageal cancer , determine endoscopy biopsy , compute tomography ( CT ) endoscopic ultrasonography ( EUS ) , receive nCRT prior surgery . Procedure : In addition conventional diagnostic work-up esophageal cancer include standard PET-CT nCRT , two PET-CT scan perform nCRT well three MRI scan , nCRT time point . The first MRI ( standard-of-care PET-CT ) scan session within 6 week prior start nCRT . The second scan session take place 10-14 day start nCRT . The third final scan session plan 1-2 week surgery . Main study parameters/endpoints : Determination distinct combine diagnostic value anatomical functional MRI PET-CT evaluation treatment response nCRT patient esophageal cancer . Important image parameter include apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value , standardize uptake value ( SUV ) volume measurement different time point . The difference value time point particular interest ( delta-ADC , delta-SUV , delta-volume ) . The sensitivity ( % ) , specificity ( % ) , negative predictive value ( % ) , positive predictive value ( % ) , accuracy ( % ) different image parameter correctly identify histopathological complete response calculate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PReoperative Identification Of Response Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-center diagnostic study investigate distinct combine value MRI PET-CT response prediction response assessment nCRT esophageal cancer . The patient enrol two hospital ( UMC Utrecht M.D . Anderson Cancer Center ) first outpatient visit Department Surgery Radiation Oncology . At UMC Utrecht , study purpose three anatomical functional MRI scan make two PET-CT scan , addition pre-nCRT PET-CT scan standard care . At M.D . Anderson Cancer Center , study purpose three anatomical functional MRI scan make one PET-CT scan , addition pre-nCRT post-nCRT PET-CT scan standard care . The MRI scan protocol consist anatomical functional MRI scan . For dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) scan , contrast agent administer patient . All MRI scan perform 1.5-Tesla MRI scanner . For PET-CT scan , 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) tracer use assessment abnormal glucose metabolism tumor . Before start nCRT , schedule MRIpre baseline MRI PET-CT image enrol patient . This scanning day match irradiation treatment plan PET-CT scan , routinely make treatment planning purpose . Next , patient receive standard nCRT treatment weekly administration carboplatin ( dos titrate achieve area curve 2 mg per milliliter per minute ) paclitaxel ( 50 mg per square meter body-surface area ) 5 week UMC Utrecht 6 week M.D . Anderson Cancer Center concurrent radiotherapy ( 41.4 Gy 23 fraction Utrecht 50.4 Gy 28 fraction M.D . Anderson , deliver 5 day per week workday ) . As mentioned introduction , early study reveal PET DWI-MRI 2 week treatment show best distinction responder non-responders . Therefore , decide perform PET-CTper MRIper scan two week start nCRT . Surgery follow 6-8 week finish nCRT patient undergo preoperative MRIpost PET-CTpost scan 1-2 week surgery , combine standard preoperative outpatient follow-up appointment . Overall , extra hospital visit ask participant try schedule study activity day correspond appointment standard care . If individual case extra visit hospital need , travel expense extra visit reimburse . Important image parameter include apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value , standardize uptake value ( SUV ) volume measurement different time point . The difference value time point particular interest ( delta-ADC , delta-SUV , delta-volume ) . The sensitivity ( % ) , specificity ( % ) , negative predictive value ( % ) , positive predictive value ( % ) , accuracy ( % ) different image parameter correctly identify histopathological complete response calculate . The resection specimen evaluate meticulously accord standard protocol ( tumor type extension , lymph node , resection margin ) , additionally , finding effect nCRT report . The research population consist patient resectable esophageal carcinoma , schedule receive preoperative chemoradiation accord CROSS-regimen . The participant recruit surgical outpatient clinic radiation oncology department UMC Utrecht M.D . Anderson Cancer Center . In total 50 participant available histopathologic data resection specimen require study . Inclusion criterion : In order eligible participate study , subject must meet follow criterion ( comparable CROSS-criteria ) : - Histologically confirm squamous-cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma large-cell undifferentiated carcinoma esophagus esophagogastric junction ( i.e . tumor involve cardia esophagus endoscopy ) - Potentially resectable tumor ( cT1b-4a N0-3 M0 ) : base standard primary stag EUS CT - Undergoing preoperative chemoradiation accord CROSS-regimen - Age &gt; 18 year - No history cancer previous radiotherapy chemotherapy - Signed informed consent Exclusion criterion : A potential subject meet follow criterion exclude participation study : - Patients meet exclusion criterion MRI 1.5T follow protocol department Radiology UMC Utrecht - Patients meet local exclusion criterion intravenous contrast ( Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2 , unless patient risk factor contrast nephropathy accord UMC Utrecht protocol 'Prevention contrast reaction contrast nephropathy , Version 2 February 2012 ' ) . In patient risk factor ( 2 following : 'peripheral vascular disease , heart failure , age &gt; 75 year , anemia , symptomatic hypotension , dehydration , use diuretic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) ' , minimum GFR 60 mL/min/1.73m2 require - Patients insulin dependent diabetes mellitus blood plasma glucose concentration high 10 mmol/L - Patients know Gadovist allergy - Patients know CT-contrast allergy - Patients difficulty understand Dutch - Pregnant breast-feeding patient</detailed_description>
