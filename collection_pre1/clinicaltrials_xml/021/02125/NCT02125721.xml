	<brief_title>Effect Increasing Doses Cystine Binding Thiol Drugs Cystine Capacity Patients With Cystinuria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystinuria rare genetic cause kidney stone lead significant morbidity due recurrent nature disease . As result , significant part treatment focus prevention stone formation . Current method prevention include increase fluid intake , dietary modification , alkali therapy , cystine bind thiol drug ( CBTDs ) , help increase solubility cystine urine . At present , dose CBTDs empiric , titrate specific measured effect . Our primary objective measure effect increase dos CBTDs cystine capacity . The investigator predict high dosage medication lead positive urinary cystine capacity , ability urine take cystine ( therefore decrease risk stone formation ) . However , dose increase dosage medication cease provide additional benefit unknown . The investigator directly measure cystine capacity urine response increase dos medication determine dose maximum benefit drug exist . This cross-over trial escalating dos . There four part study . In first part , subject stop take CBTDs 7 day , perform 24-hour urine collection day 7 . In part 2 , take usual CBTD ( either tiopronin d-penicillamine ) 1 gram per day 7 day . They perform another 24-hour urine collection day 7 study period . In part 3 , take usual CBTD 2 gram per day 7 day part 4 take CBTD 3 gram per day 7 day . Again , perform 24-hour urine collection day 7 period . The order part study perform randomize subject . The mean cystine capacity part study compare determine effect drug dosage urinary cystine capacity .</detailed_description>
