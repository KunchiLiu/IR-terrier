	<brief_summary>Arterial Blood Gas ( ABG ) sample common procedure hospital worldwide . Often , ABG sample obtain insert needle radial artery wrist - procedure often painful dreaded patient . Therefore , doctor use local anaesthetic others argue make procedure difficult cause pain . The use local anaesthetic cost approximately £1 per injection thousand ABGs perform per month , cost easily appreciable . However , good research guide clinicians use omission local anaesthetic ABGs . This first randomise clinical trial ass efficacy inject local anaesthetic perceive pain radial artery puncture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radial ABG Sampling : A RCT Lidocaine Local Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Arterial Blood Gas ( ABG ) sample common procedure clinical practice , order obtain arterial blood monitor respiratory/metabolic disease . Normally , ABG sample involves puncture radial artery needle syringe . associate significant pain . Local anaesthetic agent ( LA ) may infiltrate skin overlie radial artery order reduce pain vasospasm . LA may form topical cream solution subcutaneous injection ( eg . lignocaine ) . Similarly , LA formulation vary concentration active agent , incrementally range 0.5 % 4 % . An early 3-group placebo control trial Lightower Elliot ( 1977 ) show infiltration lidocaine vs. placebo vs. infiltration reduce amount pain associate arterial puncture . However , numerous weakness trial design write-up . Since , publish trial compare subcutaneous local anaesthesia placebo control represent significant gap literature . More recently , topical anaesthetic agent show reduce pain associated venepuncture study show topical agent beneficial arterial puncture . To-date good evidence guide practice . Recent survey show hospital clinician use LA 2-60 % time support evidence practice carry significant cost . There exist press need robust data , well-designed randomise controlled trial . Further , study consider economic impact use LA common procedure represent another significant gap literature potential area saving NHS Trusts Nationwide . Rationale Currently , clinicians advocate LA ABG sample claim reduces pain , whilst others disagree state fast accurate puncture prevents pain . Such claim , potential reduce patient pain/anxiety opportunity save NHS Trusts significant money warrant thorough investigation . Aims The investigator aim investigate role subcutaneous local anaesthesia vs. anaesthesia inpatient undergo ABG sample . Type study A Pragmatic Blocked Two-Group Parallel Randomised Controlled Trial Radial Artery Blood Gas Sampling Technique . Research question Primary research question ; 1 . Does use LA reduce amount pain experience patient radial artery stab blood gas analysis , compare LA ( control ) ? Secondary research question ; 1 . Does systemic analgesia influence amount perceive pain radial artery stab blood gas analysis ? 2 . Does health professional 's experience level affect amount pain perceived patient , radial artery stab blood gas analysis ? 3 . Does use LA affect success rate radial artery stab blood gas analysis , compare LA ( control ) ? Outcome measure A 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) use quantify amount pain experience patient . A VAS chosen : participant could accurately record pain perception without limitation ( eg . Likert system ) measurements 1mm may capture . Our primary outcome measure report pain , group , ABG sampling , measure 10cm VAS . Secondary outcome measure include : perceived quality radial pulse , success ABG attempt whether needle re-positioned within skin , degree patient movement ABG , volume blood obtain change patient heart rate . Other outcome Appendix 1 serve explanatory/adjusting variable analysis primary/secondary outcome subgroup analysis . The investigator choose categorise participant ' temperature `` sepsis status '' may affect cutaneous blood flow wrist therefore , perceive pain . The investigator area measuring volume blood obtain investigate whether duration puncture therefore , volume obtain affect perceive pain success attempt . Finally , The investigator interested investigate whether systemic analgesia affect perceive pain ABG stab ; crude outcome deliver preliminary data may useful future work guide interpretation data . Statistical hypothesis The null hypothesis ( H0 ) : use subcutaneous local anaesthesia affect amount report pain radial artery stab blood gas analysis , compare local anaesthesia . The alternative hypothesis ( H1 ) : use subcutaneous local anaesthesia affect amount report pain radial artery stab blood gas analysis , compare local anaesthesia . Study location All researcher base James Paget University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust ( JPUH ) . Research undertaken within Accident Emergency ( A &amp; E ) department Emergency Assessment Discharge Unit ( EADU ) JPUH . Study population All adult patient ( ≥18 year old ) within department A &amp; E EADU JPUH require ABG part normal clinical care . Sample size No trial regard ABG sampling consider patient report pain , base VAS . The previous trial lidocaine vs. placebo vs. control show group difference . Therefore , give lack publish data investigator estimate clinically relevant difference pain group 10 % ( 10 mm pain VAS ) . Assuming equal standard deviation 10 % group , 32 subject ( 16 per group ) 80 % power , 44 subject ( 22 per group ) 90 % power , 5 % significance level require . The JPUH A &amp; E EADU obtain analysis approximately 600 ABGs month . Audit data show approximately 85 % ( n≈510 ) sample first time analyse arterial blood radial artery stab ( remainder capillary blood gas neonates/children , arterial line patient within ITU artery ) . Therefore , approximately 510 eligible ABGs per month average up-take rate 30 % , assume take 5 month recruit minimum sample size . Therefore , The investigator allow 6 month order recruit sufficient patient . Once achieve , recruitment stop . There independent data monitor ass data monthly interval , order determine whether trial stop prematurely ( eg . significant large difference group become apparent ) . The independent data monitor Dr Willy Notcutt . Participants group either `` Group 1 = Control '' `` Group 2 = Local Anaesthesia '' . Inclusion criteria All adult patient ( ≥18 year old ) undergo first radial artery blood sample part normal care hospital admission , include within trial . Exclusion criteria Patients meet criterion exclude : - Negative Allen 's test - patient clinically visible connection radial ulnar artery exclude , compromise radial artery puncture thrombosis may theoretically result hand ischaemia . - Urgent ABG - patient require urgent ABG ( within 20 minute ) unable fully consider participant information sheet consent , exclude . - GCS &lt; 15 - patient fully alert orientate excluded consent participate alter conscious level may affect pain perception . - Prior fail ABG attempt contralateral limb . - Previous participation - ascertain Trial folder ( participant JPUH Patient ID record ) . Randomisation Participants randomise group accord random number table , random block size 4 6 . Blocking allow equal distribution participant group . By use random block size , equal distribution participant well achieve researcher unable predict future allocation base block size . There stratification variable , currently know factor influence success outcome ABG sample radial artery consultation expert field conclude unlikely explanatory variable patient 1st ABG . Further , stratify , investigator well able generalise finding general population . Consenting participant randomise 3rd party ( ward clerk EADU ) , accord sequentially number , seal opaque envelope . Third party allocation ensure adherence randomisation pattern . The consent health professional telephone visit person EADU ward clerk , select next envelope open . Within envelope , Appendix 1 detail group atop form . The ward clerk communicate group health professional record participant ' personal detail ( age , sex BMI within Appendix 1 ) alongside allocate group , within dedicate book keep locked draw EADU ward clerk 's desk . The EADU ward clerk pas envelope contain Appendix 1 health professional data collection . We choose seal opaque envelope method allocation allow rapid access trial material cheaper ( thus viable ) alternative telephone randomisation , without compromise technical success . As numerous health professional participate data collection phase trial , opportunity 'logging ' subversion allocation concealment minimal . Furthermore , longer x-ray light box instal within JPUH , researcher unable see group ( though envelope ) open envelope . Blinding As trial technique give intrinsic nature study , investigator unable blind either clinician patient intervention . Whilst appreciate importance double blind trial , propose methodology pragmatic , easily implement minimal cost may yield result indicate need future blind study . Researcher bias due non-blinding issue consider therefore take step reduce : Clinicians undertake research ( ie . obtain ABG sample ) train study protocol instruct discuss amount pain participant experience consciously influence outcome way , minimise bias . Bias non-blinding participant issue , believe patient preconceive idea technique/method obtain ABG sample therefore could bias answer way . The investigator believe design best , practical feasible approach address clinically important divide .
