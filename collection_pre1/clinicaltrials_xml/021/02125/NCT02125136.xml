	<brief_summary>The aim ot study investigate efficacy safety two new intensified chemotherapy regimen ( gemcitabine ( Gem ) /nab- paclitaxel ( PAC ) , FOLFIRINOX ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocol locally advance , non-metastatic pancreatic cancer ( LAPC ) consecutive conversion tumor resectability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Investigate Intensified Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective open randomize multicenter phase II trial two arm . Patients suffer histologically confirm LAPC ( assess unresectable borderline resectable accord National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) Clinical Practice Guidelines `` pancreatic adenocarcinoma '' version 1.2013 ) without metastasis receive two different neoadjuvant treatment regimen : First patient receive two cycle Gem/nab-PAC ( duration cycle 28 day ) neoadjuvant chemotherapy equal measure first restaging perform two cycle base image criterion . If progression accord Response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST 1.1 ) criterion first restaging , patient randomize 1:1 relation : Two cycle Gem/nab-PAC ( duration cycle 28 day ) . Four cycle FOLFIRINOX ( duration cycle 14 day ) . After neoadjuvant chemotherapy 2nd restaging perform base image criterion . All patient without progression restaging early time point undergo obligatory exploratory laparotomy irrespective imaging criterion assess resectability . If evaluate convert resectable exploratory laparotomy , pancreas resection curative intent perform . All patient successful R0 R1 pancreatic resection receive three cycle adjuvant chemotherapy Gem/nab-PAC . Adjuvant chemotherapy start within 4 8 week pancreatic resection surgery . Further treatment patient PD 1st 2nd restaging well patient unresectable status base exploratory laparotomy discretion local investigator ( e.g . second-line chemotherapy case distant relapse local radiochemotherapy case local progression definitive irresectability ) . All patient follow local recurrence , progression survival death least one year last application study drug whichever sooner . The translational research conduct exploratory analysis potential biomarkers possible prognostic predictive value efficacy neoadjuvant chemotherapy LAPC ; include analysis circulate tumor cell , molecular pathway pancreatic adenocarcinoma include SPARC expression .</detailed_description>
