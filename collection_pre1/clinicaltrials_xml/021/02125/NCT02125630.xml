	<brief_summary>A randomized trial evaluate resection primary breast tumor woman present de novo stage IV breast cancer bone metastasis . Previous report carefully select patient present stage IV breast cancer suggest surgery primary tumor may result improved survival , remain unproven . The early result ongoing trial MF07-01 trial ( phase III randomize control trial breast cancer woman distant metastasis presentation receive loco-regional treatment intact primary tumor compare receive treatment ) show patient bone metastasis trend toward improved survival initial surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomized trial evaluate resection primary breast tumor woman present de novo stage IV breast cancer bone metastasis . Previous report carefully select patient present stage IV breast cancer suggest surgery primary tumor may result improved survival , remain unproven . The early result ongoing trial MF07-01 trial ( phase III randomize control trial breast cancer woman distant metastasis presentation receive loco-regional treatment intact primary tumor compare receive treatment ) show patient bone metastasis trend toward improved survival initial surgery . Our goal test primary surgery improve overall survival bone metastasis diagnose biopsy</detailed_description>
