	<brief_summary>Rationale : Skin cancer common Caucasians often exist sun-exposed area , face . Treatment choice mostly excision result irreversible scar . As incidence skin cancer rising , also among young people , important obtain good cosmetic outcome treatment . It believe type closure wound excision influence cosmetic result . Currently , primary closure excision occur transcutaneous ( TC ) intracutaneous ( IC ) suturing . Both technique widely use among dermatologist plastic surgeon choice mainly dependent preference physician . Research compare cosmetic result technique craniofacial area lacking . Objective : Evaluation cosmetic result transcutaneous suture versus intracutaneous suture craniofacial area . Study design : A randomized control single-blinded multi-center trial . Study population : Patients older 18 year , craniofacial skin tumor receive surgery follow primary closure department Dermatology Plastic Surgery Maastricht University Medical Centre , department Dermatology Catharina hospital Eindhoven department Plastic surgery Orbis Medical Centre Sittard . Intervention : Excision tumor follow IC suture TC suture Main study endpoint : Cosmetic result measure Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale ( POSAS ) patient researcher 12 month surgery . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : All patient participate indication excision assign one suture technique . Both technique widely use regular patient care . Therefore , extra risk associate . Patients ask visit hospital 3 month 1 year follow treatment , point questionnaire fill redness scar measure mean non-invasive technique . In addition , patient ask apply sunscreen scar daily first three month follow-up .</brief_summary>
