	<brief_summary>Despite advance understand hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) diagnosis , prognosis patient HCC remain dishearten , due high recurrence rate frequent intrahepatic metastasis . Various therapy use hepatic resection report , associated adverse side effect fail improve overall survival . Nowadays , adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) recommend effective therapy postoperative HCC . And indication patient risk factor recurrence . While prospective study reveal radiotherapy effective advanced HCC . And side effect radiotherapy control . Until , prospective retrospective study compare efficacy adjuvant TACE radiotherapy postoperative HCC .</brief_summary>
