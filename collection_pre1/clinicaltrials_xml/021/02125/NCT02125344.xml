	<brief_summary>Two regimen currently consider high efficacy patient high-risk early stage breast cancer : sequential treatment high dose epirubicin , taxane , cyclophosphamide concomitantly dual HER2-blockade , weekly treatment paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin dual HER2-blockade carboplatin . The aim GeparOcto study compare two regimen/strategies . Both regimen myelosuppressive significant incidence chemotherapy induce anaemia . The second aim GeparOcto study therefore compare use parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician 's choice treatment chemotherapy-induced anemia patient iron deficiency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Trial Comparing Two Dose-dense , Dose-intensified Approaches ( ETC PM ( Cb ) ) Neoadjuvant Treatment Patients With High-risk Early Breast Cancer ( GeparOcto )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several recent strategy improve efficacy systemic treatment patient high-risk early stage breast cancer : addition dual HER2-blockade HER2-positive ; implementation carboplatin TNBC use dose-dense dose-dense , dose escalated chemotherapy high-risk subtypes breast cancer . Two regimen currently consider high efficacy : sequential treatment high dose epirubicin , taxane , cyclophosphamide ( ETC ) concomitantly dual HER2-blockade mainly base AGO ETC adjuvant study , weekly treatment paclitaxel/non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin dual HER2-blockade carboplatin ( PM ( Cb ) ) base GeparSixto study . The aim GeparOcto study compare two regimen/strategies . Both regimen myelosuppressive significant incidence chemotherapy induce anaemia . Anemia often associate impaired physical cognitive function consequently patient suffer reduce quality life . Surgical complication higher anemic patient . The second aim GeparOcto study therefore compare use parental ferric carboxymaltose versus physician 's choice treatment chemotherapy-induced anemia patient iron deficiency .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients eligible study participation comply follow criterion : Written inform consent accord local regulatory requirement prior begin specific protocol procedure . Complete baseline documentation must submit via MedCODES GBG Forschungs GmbH . Unilateral bilateral primary carcinoma breast , confirm histologically core biopsy . Fineneedle aspiration breast lesion alone sufficient . Incisional biopsy axillary clearance allow . In case bilateral cancer , investigator decide prospectively side evaluated primary endpoint . Tumor lesion breast palpable size 2 cm sonographical size 1 cm maximum diameter . The lesion measurable two dimension , preferably sonography . In case inflammatory disease , extent inflammation use measurable lesion . Patients must stage cT1c cT4ad disease . Patients HER2 positive TNBC eligible irrespective nodal status ( cN0cN3 ) . Patients luminal Blike tumor ( define ER and/or PgR &gt; 1 % stained cell , HER2 negative , Ki67 &gt; 20 % ) histologically ( sentinelnode biopsy , core fineneedle biopsy ) involve lymph node ( pN13 ) . In patient multifocal multicentric breast cancer , large lesion measure . Centrally confirm ER , PR HER2 status . Central pathology include also assessment Ki67 LPBC status core biopsy . ER/PR negative define &lt; =1 % stain cell HER2positive define IHC 3+ insitu hybridization ( ISH ) accord ASCOCAP guideline 2013 ) . Formalinfixed , paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) breast tissue core biopsy therefore send GBG central pathology laboratory prior randomization . Age &gt; =18 year . Karnofsky Performance status index 90 % . Confirmed normal cardiac function ECG cardiac ultrasound ( LVEF shorten fraction ) within 4 week prior randomization . LVEF must 55 % . Negative pregnancy test ( urine serum ) within 14 day prior randomization woman childbearing potential . Complete stag workup within 3 month prior randomization . All patient must bilateral mammography , breast ultrasound ( 21 day ) , breast MRI ( optional ) . Chest Xray ( PA lateral ) , abdominal ultrasound CT scan MRI , bone scan case high risk primary metastasis . In case positive bone scan , bone Xray CT scan mandatory . Other test may perform clinically indicate . Patients must agree central pathology test core biopsy specimen final pathology specimen available compliant treatment followup . In addition patient randomize two supportive anemia treatment arm : Hemoglobin level &lt; 10g/dl . Body weight ≥ 40 kg . No need immediate red blood cell transfusion . Transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) ≤20 % serum ferritin &lt; 300ng/ml . Patients ER and/or PRpositive , HER2negative breast cancer Ki 67 &lt; = 20 % ( luminal Alike subtype ) luminal Blike ( Ki67 &gt; 20 % ) subtype without nodal involvement . Patients stag cT1a , cT1b , M1 . Patients pure lobular invasive breast cancer . Prior chemotherapy malignancy . Prior radiation therapy breast cancer . Pregnant lactating patient .
