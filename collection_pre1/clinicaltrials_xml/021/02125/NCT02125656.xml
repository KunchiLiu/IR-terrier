	<brief_summary>Sleep essential biological process life great value function learn , memory processing , cell brain repair . Recently , new evidence point relationship lack sleep carbohydrate metabolism , establish framework insulin resistance observe study restriction sleep deprivation several night single night . To reverse process , one effective strategy physical exercise part list literature non-pharmacological tool prevention health promotion , well treatment disease . However , pace modern society cause people practice le physical exercise , lack time main reason . In scenario , High Intensity Interval Training ( HIIT ) emerge powerful strategy induces major change optimize time spend activity . Considering benefit mode , purpose study investigate effect high-intensity interval training context insulin resistance observe sleep deprivation . Will recruit 20 male volunteer , age 18 35 year old , healthy , normal sleep duration equivalent 7-8 hour / night , smoke regular eating habit . They submit protocol 6 session high-intensity interval train two week , since end period , sleep normally , deprive sleep 24 hour . Biochemical ( thyroid hormone , cortisol , glucagon , free fatty acid , cholesterol , glucose insulin ) undertaken well evaluation body composition plethysmography , basal metabolic rate indirect calorimetry insulin sensitivity Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) training period .</brief_summary>
