	<brief_summary>An abdominal aortic aneurysm occur part aorta travel abdomen balloon 50 % . If catch early , treatment use prevent rupture aneurysm . However , many aneurysm asymptomatic go undetected rupture , cause large amount blood spill abdominal cavity typically lead death , leave untreated . The current mortality rate 50 90 % . The resource require treat patient rupture aortic aneurysm quite substantial give need blood transfusion prolong hospital stay . Patients either undergo invasive operative repair , associate great blood product transfusion complication , relatively stable , undergo less invasive repair tube call stent . There less morbidity associate latter , endovascular repair . To prevent blood loss elective surgery , drug promote blood clotting often use . One drug , tranexamic acid , show reduce blood loss , reduce number blood transfusion require improve patient outcome elective cardiac orthopaedic surgery , recently , patient traumatic hemorrhage . However , drug test particular population . The purpose pilot project evaluate effectiveness tranexamic acid reduce clinically significant bleeding patient rupture aortic aneurysm hospital site across Saskatchewan use single-group intervention design . The investigator compare data patient treat tranexamic acid retrospective data control group match key variable . The investigator predict tranexamic acid result reduce bleeding , reduce need blood transfusion , less patient require open surgery improve patient outcome . The result study help determine treatment effective prevent death many people rupture abdominal aortic aneurysm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study examine effectiveness TXA reduce clinically significant bleed novel patient population ( ruptured AAA ) . The first phase study involve small pilot project , consist ~25 patient administer TXA treatment rupture AAA . We compare amount clinically significant bleed group patient treat prospectively TXA data collect retrospectively previous year match control group patient treat ruptured AAA give TXA . At conclusion pilot , data reveal administration TXA patient rupture AAA reduces incidence clinically significant bleeding , proceed multicenter national trial determine generalizability TXA use treat rupture AAA patient across Canada . METHODOLOGY This study employ 1-year prospective non-randomized intervention design . All patient present southern Saskatchewan hospital clinically-confirmed ruptured AAA 1-year enrollment period potential participant . We aim enroll 25 consecutive patient rupture AAA . Regina ( Regina General Hospital ) primary site study . Rural hospital surround area refer patient Regina trauma surgery secondary site . Local Health Canada Qualified Investigators responsible manage study hospital Diagnosis Patients present Saskatchewan emergency room ( ER ) symptom rupture AAA might ultrasound CT scan confirm diagnosis part investigation . The current standard care , however , clinical assessment , may aid prior image history unruptured AAA . Enrollment without radiologic confirmation time presentation ER would take place upon recommendation vascular surgeon Regina . At time , patient 's pharmaceutical history examine use Pharmaceutical Information Program ( PIP ) system determine patient contradiction TXA list patient Saskatchewan . Since province PIP program , study restrict patient Saskatchewan Health Cards . For patient meet study inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , proceed three-part informed consent procedure base individual case ( i.e. , patient conscious capable give informed consent , patient incapable give informed consent patient 's next-of-kin legally authorize representative provide verbal write consent , patient incapable give consent next-of-kin legally authorize representative contact timely manner ( 30 minute ) `` Dual Physician Consent '' use ) . TXA Administration Patients ultrasound CT hospital/care centre outside catchment area Regina ( rural patient ) receive first dose TXA ( one gram IV ten minute ) local attend physician ( ER family physician ) . For patient diagnosed Regina , vascular surgeon responsible order TXA upon diagnosis emergency room . Rural patient Regina catchment area transfer trauma center Regina vascular surgeon notify patient part study receive TXA . For patient , second dose TXA ( one gram IV administer 8 hour ) order vascular surgeon anesthesiologist ER , OR theatre intensive care unit Regina . Dosing recommendation base data result CRASH-2 Trial.30 If patient stabilizes result TXA administration , patient proceed angiogram suite ( interventional radiology ) vascular surgeon perform endovascular stenting . If patient becomes remain hemodynamically unstable arrival , patient proceed operate room laparotomy open repair aneurysm . Procedures subsequent treatment remain current standard care rupture AAA 's . We collect data patient his/her care patient 's stay hospital . Given little risk adverse event occur administration TXA hospital stay , patient release hospital , direct follow-up . Statistical analysis We compare data experimental group ( TXA ) data match control patient collect retrospectively ( control ) . The patient match age , sex , ethnicity , history peripheral vascular disease , coronary artery disease , aneurysms , current medication ( antihypertensive , anticoagulant , NSAIDs ) . Our primary analysis compare outcomes measure interval/ratio scale use independent t-tests ANOVA 's non-parametric Mann-Whitney/Kruskal-Wallis data skewed . For categorical data , chi-square Fisher 's Exact test effect size measure use analyze relationship treatment outcome ( e.g . incidence abdominal compartment syndrome experimental vs. control group ) . We use two-sided test alpha set .05 able detect TXA produce bad outcome standard treatment .</detailed_description>
