	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study investigate whether surgery re-irradiation help treat ependymoma come back initial treatment . The combined dos first second course radiation high usual standard care . The investigator study effect side effect surgery re-irradiation . They also evaluate study tumor tissue blood learn tumor respond treatment use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan see predict tumor response tumor recurrence . Participants follow 5 year follow enrollment . Evaluations radiation therapy do weekly receiving therapy 7 week . Other evaluation do enrollment , every 4 month enrollment 3 year , every 6 month 4th 5th year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stratification treatment determine radiation therapy planning initiate . Patients stratify outcome accord diagnosis prior therapy . - Stratum 1 ( initial pattern failure local ) ; disease confine primary site ; age &gt; 12 month time enrollment &lt; 21 year . Treatment : focal irradiation . - Stratum 2 ( initial pattern failure metastatic ) ; neuraxis metastatic disease without equivocal evidence local failure ; age &gt; 36 month time enrollment &lt; 21 year . Treatment : craniospinal irradiation . - Stratum 3 ( Initial pattern failure local metastatic ) : neuraxis metastatic disease unequivocal evidence local failure ; age &gt; 36 month time enrollment &lt; 21 year . Treatment : craniospinal irradiation . - Stratum 4 ( initial pattern failure local ) : disease confine primary site , age &gt; 36 month time enrollment &lt; 21 year ; tumor show presence 1g gain . Treatment : craniospinal irradiation ( optional ) . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To prospectively estimate progression-free overall survival distribution child young adult recurrent ependymoma treated second course irradiation monitor excessive central nervous system necrosis . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To explore potential association clinical treatment factor incidence severity neurological , endocrine cognitive deficit child young adult ependymoma treat second course irradiation . - Using specific measure sleep quality , excessive daytime sleepiness , daytime activity , fatigue , symptom distress , quality life , explore association sleep , fatigue quality life measure CNS effect , clinical treatment factor child young adult ependymoma treat second course irradiation . - To evaluate explore difference physical performance movement child young adult ependymoma treat second course irradiation . - Estimate compare response residual tumor incidence severity structural , physiological , vascular effect normal brain child young adult ependymoma treatment second course irradiation use specific method diffusion , contrast-enhancement , magnetization transfer , vascular functional neuroimaging , explore association measure CNS effect clinical treatment factor . Determine time course gray matter white matter tract injury recovery post irradiation association image metric derive serial quantitative neural imaging radiation dosimetry well neuro-cognitive outcome . Other Pre-Specified ( Exploratory ) Objectives : - Estimate avidity ependymoma 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) 11C-methionine positron emission tomography ( IND # 104987 ) prior radiation therapy correlate change avidity 12 , 24 36 month second course irradiation tumor progression . - Measure growth factor cytokine responses child young adult ependymoma treatment second course irradiation , explore association measure CNS effect clinical treatment factor . Descriptively compare finding patient treat initial course irradiation . - To conduct variety exploratory molecular analysis tumor sample ( blood germline control require ) , include limited broad ( genome-wide / array-based ) focus ( gene-specific ) analyse DNA , RNA , protein level next generation ( whole genome , exome , transcriptome ) sequence effort improve investigator understand ependymoma biology , explore association molecular finding treatment response various side effect include vasculopathy , hear loss , cognitive deficit , growth hormone deficiency measure appropriate . - To explore association chemotherapy give prior re-irradiation progression-free survival overall survival distribution - To compare progression-free overall survival distribution child ( age &gt; 3 year ) young adult recurrent ependymoma 1g gain treated second course irradiation ( focal craniospinal ) monitoring excessive central nervous system necrosis .</detailed_description>
