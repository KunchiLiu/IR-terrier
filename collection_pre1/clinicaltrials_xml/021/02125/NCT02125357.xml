	<brief_summary>This study offer patient castrate-resistant ( also know hormone-refractory ) prostate cancer . The cancer metastasize spread outside prostate area part body . The purpose study evaluate effect sequence hormonal therapy ( abiraterone acetate enzalutamide ) ass treatment efficacy two agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequencing Abiraterone Enzalutamide mCRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abiraterone acetate enzalutamide emerge standard therapy metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . Both agent improve outcome patient previously treat docetaxel chemotherapy-naive . Although mechanisms action differ , abiraterone enzalutamide target persistent androgen receptor ( AR ) signal . Abiraterone inhibit CYP17 testicular extragonadal androgen production whereas enzalutamide directly antagonise AR . Whether cross resistance occur agent use sequence unknown , theoretically disparate mechanism resistance may allow successful sequence agent . Prior study report Prostate-Specific Antigen ( PSA ) response rate 10 % patient treat abiraterone enzalutamide 13 % -29 % patient treat enzalutamide abiraterone . Since data generate small , retrospective series , prospective clinical trial warrant evaluate effect sequence abiraterone enzalutamide . A randomised phase II study propose patient PSA progression abiraterone enzalutamide cross opposite agent . Although surrogate clinical outcome , PSA change use ass treatment efficacy since PSA expression driven AR activation . Apart determine optimal sequence abiraterone enzalutamide mCRPC patient , key issue associate use agent identify circulate biomarkers associate treatment response resistance . Our group preliminary data show high proportion enzalutamide-resistant mCRPC patient abiraterone-resistant mCRPC patient possess focal AR amplification cell-free tumour DNA extract plasma . In pre-clinical study , potential mechanism resistance agent include increased expression AR splice variant ( abiraterone enzalutamide ) increase expression CYP17 ( abiraterone ) , upregulation stress-activated chaperone protein clusterin ( enzalutamide ) point mutation ( F876L ) ligand-binding domain AR ( enzalutamide ) . Non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) additional biomarkers interest since implicate tumorigenesis readily detectable plasma mCRPC patient . Examination biomarkers serum plasma plan , aim identify potentially novel factor associate treatment efficacy resistance mCRPC patient receive abiraterone enzalutamide . The cognitive effect abiraterone enzalutamide well describe . Enzalutamide known cross blood-brain barrier infrequently cause seizure , possibly related effect γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channel . In enzalutamide registration study , small subset ( &lt; 5 % ) patient also develop mental impairment disorder include amnesia , memory impairment , cognitive disorder disturbance attention . Conversely , central nervous system effect abiraterone report . Cognitive test therefore undertaken study evaluate potential difference agent .</detailed_description>
