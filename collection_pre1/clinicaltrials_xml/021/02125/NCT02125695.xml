	<brief_summary>The main objective study : To determine RNA recovery tape harvest allows identification disease gene signature ( e.g. , interferon [ IFN ] signature lupus ) biomarkers may differentiate affect normal unaffected skin ; To determine lupus gene signature differentially express epidermis active discoid lupus erythematosus ( DLE ) subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( SCLE ) lesion compare unaffected skin participant skin healthy volunteer ( HVs ) ; To determine atopic dermatitis ( AD ) gene signature differentially express epidermis active AD lesion compare unaffected skin participant skin HVs ; To correlate level transcript target gene skin tape harvest obtain blood .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Key Healthy volunteer must good overall health determine Investigator , base medical history , physical examination ( per standard dermatology practice ) , vital sign . Subjects lupus must present active DLE SCLE skin disease ( without systemic manifestation SLE , define ≥4 11 classification criterion SLE ) . Subjects AD must diagnose Eichenfield revise criterion Hanifin Rajka , disease duration least 2 year Screening disease activity define Investigator 's Global Assessment ( IGA ) score ≥3 screen Key History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction history allergic reaction likely exacerbate tape harvesting ( e.g. , allergy adhesive ) . Other unspecified reason , opinion Investigator , make subject unsuitable enrollment . Key Exclusion Criteria Healthy Volunteers History clinically significant medical condition , determine Investigator , may impact study analysis Key Exclusion Criteria Subjects Discoid Subacute Cutaneous Lupus : Evidence skin condition DLE SCLE Day 1 Visit , opinion Investigator , would interfere study execution analysis . History malignancy last 5 year ( nonmelanoma skin cancer consider cure Investigator exclusionary ) . Key Exclusion Criteria Subjects With Atopic Dermatitis : History clinically significant medical condition , AD , determine Investigator , may impact study analysis , include , limited : History human immunodeficiency virus ; History hepatitis C virus hepatitis B virus infection ; Symptoms bacterial viral infection ( include skin infection ) within 14 day prior Day 1 Visit ; History malignancy last 5 year ( nonmelanoma skin cancer consider cure Investigator exclusionary ) . Evidence skin condition AD Day 1 Visit , opinion Investigator , would interfere study execution analysis . NOTE : Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
