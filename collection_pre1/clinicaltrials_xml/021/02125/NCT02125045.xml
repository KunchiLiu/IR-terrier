	<brief_summary>Background . The antioxidant system main endogenous defense free radical , glutathione seem play important role mechanism . Reduced glutathione enters detoxification process endogenous product , hydro- lipoperoxides exogenous compound pollutant , heavy metal drug . Changes GSH homeostasis implicate etiology progression several disease . Supplementation GSH may improve endogenous antioxidant defense may contribute decrease oxidant tissue damage pathophysiologic mechanism many acute chronic disease . However , efficacy GSH treatment seem closely related degree absorption increase concentration plasma cell . Previous study oral GSH administration healthy volunteer patient fail find effect term oxidative stress reduction and/or disease improvement GSH quickly catabolize gastrointestinal tract . We recently observe ( preliminary data ) new sublingual formulation L-GSH ( OXITION ) , produce PH &amp; T S.r.l. , able increase erythrocyte plasma GSH level healthy volunteer bypass gastrointestinal barrier . Objectives . The primary study objective determine whether medium term ( 4 week ) sublingual L-GSH supplementation population smoke habit and/or arterial hypertension may result improved endothelial function assess flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) technique versus placebo . FMD surrogate end point validate literature prognostic predictor major cardiovascular event patient endothelial dysfunction . Secondary study objective determine difference 2 treatment term oxidative stress marker . Methods . This phase 3 , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , cross-over study perform one centre . Sixteen male subject , age ≥ 40 ≤ 60 year , smoke habit and/or hypertension define arterial blood pressure ≥ 140 and/or 90 mmHg anti-hypertensive treatment , enrol randomize receive sublingual L-GSH ( 100 mg twice day ) placebo accord double-blind cross-over design 4 week 3-week wash-out period two treatment . Baseline end treatment period , FMD assessment blood sample collection routine ( creatinine , urea , AST , ALT GGT , total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglyceride , fast glucose ) specific ( aminothiols , nitrotyrosine , malondialdehyde , 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanine ) biochemical determination perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sublingual L-GSH Supplementation Male Subjects With Smoking Habit and/or Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The strategy prevent cardiovascular disease play prominent role guideline different scientific society . Risk factor lead several biological reaction within cell term pathophysiology , thus response homeostasis alteration . It know smoke habit hypertension alters endothelial function direct oxidative damage endothelial cell , decrease nitric oxide availability , affect mobilization endothelial progenitor cell bone marrow . Several study identify response activation mechanism prevent formation oxidize specie , detoxify dangerous product . The antioxidant system , thus , main endogenous defense free radical , glutathione seem play important role mechanism . Reduced glutathione ( GSH ) , form cysteine , glycine glutamate , enters detoxification process endogenous product , peroxide final pathway many reaction cause cardiovascular risk factor . It also act exogenous compound , pollutant , heavy metal drug . Changes GSH homeostasis implicate etiology progression several disease . A reduced bioavailability GSH associate neurodegenerative disease Parkinson 's Alzheimer 's increase risk cardiovascular event . The imbalance GSH homeostasis aminothiols redox state also involve mechanism cause chronic obstructive pulmonary lung diseases cystic fibrosis . Low level GSH find individual HIV associate reduced patient survival . On basis previous data , conceivable supplementation GSH , whose concentration decrease merely age , may improve endogenous antioxidant defense may contribute decrease oxidant tissue damage , typical characteristic many acute chronic disease . Several author study effect GSH oral administration acute medium-long term treatment healthy volunteer patient affect different disease . Unfortunately , find beneficial effect term oxidative stress reduction and/or disease improvement . GSH also administer intravenous , intramuscular intrabronchial without positive result . The efficacy GSH treatment seem closely related degree absorption increase concentration plasma cell . Preliminary data obtain Institute Clinical Physiology Institute Milan small sample healthy volunteer show sublingual administration ( 100 mg ) new preparation L-glutathione ( OXITION , PH &amp; T S.r.l . ) able increase 4 h , plasma erythrocyte GSH concentration average 70 % compare endogenous physiological level . This increase detectable oral intake molecule due gastrointestinal barrier . The primary objective study determine whether medium-term sublingual administration reduce L-GSH 4 week male subject risk factor smoke habit and/or arterial hypertension result improve endothelial function , assess arterial FMD , compare placebo . A favourable response study compound result great endothelium-dependent vasodilatory ability assess ratio peak flow reactive hyperaemia basal flow . Secondary study objective determine difference L-GSH supplementation placebo term oxidative stress marker . Sixteen male healthy subject randomize sequential allocation reduce L-GSH placebo , accord follow inclusion criterion : age 40 60 year , without sign symptom cardio-cerebro-vascular event enrolment , smoke habit ( &gt; 10 cigarette/die ) and/or arterial hypertension ( PAS≥140 mmHg and/or PAD≥90 mmHg anti-hypertensive treatment ) . Consenting subject enrol sequentially assign study treatment follow double-blind , cross , randomize control experimental design ( L-GSH versus placebo ) 3-week wash-out period two treatment . Each intervention last 4 week . Baseline evaluation include interview history nutritional characterization , blood pressure heart rate assessment , blood sample routine haematological analysis [ serum fast glucose ( GLU ) , total cholesterol ( TC ) , LDL cholesterol ( LDL-C ) , HDL cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , creatinine ( CREA ) , urea , gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase ( GGT ) , aspartate-amino transferase ( AST ) alanine-amino transferase ( ALT ) ] , specific biochemical determination endogenous redox status ( total reduce plasma aminothiols , total reduce blood glutathione HPLC ) oxidative stress mediator [ plasma nitrotyrosine ( NT ) , plasma malondialdehyde ( MDA ) plasma 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) ELISA Kits ] . FMD measure non invasive plethysmographic method ( Endo-PAT2000 ) base registration pulsatile blood volume fingertip hand . After baseline assessment , patient randomize computer base procedure active treatment placebo 1:1 ratio . Study drug dispense . At 4-week follow-up , vital sign assessment , blood sample routine specific biochemical determination , FMD test perform .</detailed_description>
