	<detailed_description>Introduction A prelabor rupture membrane ( PROM ) define loss amniotic fluid within rupture amniotic membrane onset labour , preterm prelabor rupture membrane ( PPROM ) refers PROM 37+0 week gestation . PPROM occur 3 percent pregnancy associate one third preterm birth . There multiple risk-factors PPROM maternal physiologic , genetic , environmental well life-style factor . Of note , history PPROM previous pregnancy , antepartum bleeding , cigarette smoking genital tract infection , single identifiable risk factor , strongly associate PPROM . PPROM diagnose clinical loss fluid cervical o . In case immediately visible amniotic fluid loss gynecological inspection , diagnose ultrasound verified test like Amnisure© Fertisave© detect alpha microgloubulin 1 IGF bind protein fetal membrane . Referring randomize control trial , majority pregnancy PPROM deliver within one week membrane rupture . PPROM-related morbidity mortality , depend gestational age , high neonate mother , especially case intrauterine inflammation . Pulmonary hypoplasia , facial orthopedic deformation cause prolong , early PPROMS . As incidence infection high earlier gestational age , one third woman PPROM develop serious infection , include chorioamnionitis , endometritis septicemia . Responsible bacterias enterococcus , staphylococcus anaerobic specie . The goal antibiotic prophylaxis/therapy PPROM reduce maternal neonatal morbidity mortality . Women observe sign infection , include maternal temperature , fetal heart rate , uterine contraction , periodically common clinical infection marker . As common biomarkers like CRP leucocytes specific uterine infection , proven useful particular case . Prematurity crucial risk fetus PPROM absence complication like infection , 34 week gestation . Therefore , expectative management uncomplicated PPROM-pregnancies gestational age routinely use . This include blood cell infection monitoring , avoid vaginal manipulation , antibiotic prophylaxis/treatment corticosteroid . After reach gestational week 34+ induction labour routinely perform , without induction lung maturity . The goal quick reaction chorioamnionitis prompt delivery . Materials Methods This study conduct single centre pilot study patient PPROM . The study approve local ethic committee Medical University Vienna ( IRB number : 1031/2014 ) . Study center Department Obstetrics Gynecology Medical Universitiy Vienna General Hospital . Twenty patient verify PPROM gestation week 22 27 include . After gynecological physical examination within verification PPROM woman inform study invite participate study . Subsequently inform consent obtain OvulaRing® place vaginal fornix . The OvulaRing® non-invasive thermometer measure intravaginal temperature every 5 minute . It originally invent assess moment ovulation optimize fertility . This plastic ring include high-tech-sensored thermometer place vaginal fornix maximum 30 day , measure intravaginal core-temperature 288 time day . As change common PPROM-therapy , clinical standard parameter lead termination pregnancy . Directly delivery OvulaRing® remove sensor-data analyzed special software . Hypothesis In pilot study , investigator aim describe possible correlation core-temperature common biomarkers clinical use detection chorioamnionitis patient PPROM possibly assess optimal time delivery . A correlation temperature CRP , leucocytes IL-6 explore . Later , fact may use optimize standard procedure PPROM . In study point need new parameter chorioamnionitis . Maybe temperature monitor become new biomarker .</detailed_description>
