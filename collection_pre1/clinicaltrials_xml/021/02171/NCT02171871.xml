	<brief_summary>The study examine change respiratory system mechanic respiratory physiology exposure subject passive smoking . It healthy non-smoking volunteer carry technique force oscillation Impulse Oscillometry ( IOS ) technique methodology nitrogen washout . The present study contribute understand passive smoking consequence respiratory system healthy non-smokers . Thanks nitrogen washout technique , change close volume closing capacity examine measurement different position ( sit , decubitus ) together exposure passive smoking . With IOS methodology , change respiratory system resistance four position ( stand , sit , right leave lateral decubitus ) evaluate exposure passive smoking environment . Results present study expect provide interest information change measure parameter different position also exposure smoke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Passive Smoking On The Respiratory System Mechanics Of Healthy Non-Smokers In Different Body Positions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology For current study follow technique use . Impulse Oscillometry ( IOS ) methodology constitutes method study respiratory system mechanic , investigator manage determine flow resistance , capacity resistance resonant frequency application multifrequent signal . It also offer possibility study mechanic central peripheral respiratory system . The nitrogen washout technique method indirect measurement functional residual capacity , exhale nitrogen measure subject breathe oxygen 100 % density . A single breath nitrogen washout contributes measurement closing volume closing capacity . Emitted particle , detect smoking environment , measure SIDEPAK AM510 , measurement device particle base diameter . The research conduct accord follow procedure . Healthy non-smoking volunteer ( 18-40 year old ) subject , give brief medical history , IOS nitrogen washout test . The IOS conduct four position ( stand , sit , right leave lateral decubitus ) , whereas nitrogen washout test two ( sit decubitus ) . Then subject expose smoking environment 20 minute , continuous measurement emit particle use SIDEPAK AM510 Pm level 2,5=250 , close space 20 m3 . The passive smoking environment achieve via smoking machine . Afterwards , subject undergo IOS four position ( stand , sit , right leave lateral decubitus ) nitrogen washout test two position ( sit decubitus ) . Thanks mention technique , change measure parameter evaluate .</detailed_description>
