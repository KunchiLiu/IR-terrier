	<brief_title>Procalcitonin Marker Antibiotic Therapy Patients With Lower Respiratory Tract Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase amount antibiotic consume along increase resistance carry along , pose increase problem health sector . A method decrease use antibiotic highly desirable great importance order halt spread multi-resistant bacteria become increase problem Denmark . Lower respiratory tract infection pneumonia acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( AECOPD ) frequent reason patient contact primary secondary sector . Identifying patient could benefit treatment antibiotic great challenge health sector . This patient often treat antibiotic mere suspicion above-mentioned disorder , even prove certain . An increase amount data suggest procalcitonin ( PCT ) could serve possible marker respiratory tract infection cause bacteria . Alongside conventional clinical parameter , level PCT regard promising mean decide whether treat antibiotic long treatment endure . When infection control immune system individual treatment antibiotic , level PCT diminish 50 % daily basis . Accordingly , decline PCT level indicate favorable response antibiotic treatment . Therefore need investigate PCT level use , everyday clinic , diagnose patient pneumonia AECOPD cause bacteria could effect use antibiotic , thus optimize treatment patient . The purpose research project compare amount antibiotic consume use standard treatment treatment base PCT level patient low respiratory tract infection , respectively . With research hand , clarification whether measurement PCT serve diagnostic tool distinguish bacterial non-bacterial infection patient suspect pneumonia AECOPD desirable . In extension , study want clarify PCT level indicate potential antibiotic treatment initiate use PCT-based treatment daily clinical work could lower consumption antibiotic . The hypothesis PCT increase ( ≥0.25 µg/l ≥0.10 µg/l pneumonia AECOPD respectively ) low respiratory tract infection cause bacteria , whereas PCT slightly increase non-bacterial low respiratory tract infection . It expect use PCT-based treatment low respiratory tract infection could lower consumption antibiotic , time prove great health risk patient use standard treatment .</detailed_description>
