	<brief_title>Effect Medical Treatment Prognosis Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome ( POTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient complain dizziness eventually diagnosed POTS . However , investigation appropriate medical treatment POTS enough yet . Also , prognosis disease treatment well know . It known propranolol attenuate tachycardia improve symptom burden patient POTS . However , effect β-Blocker , bisoprolol compare propranolol know well . In addition , acetylcholinesterase inhibition pyridostigmine effective method acutely decrease tachycardia patient POTS . However , difference among three medical treatment effect know long-term study do yet . Therefore , study investigator investigate effect medical treatment ( propranolol , bisoprolol , propranolol+pyridostigmine , bisoprolol+pyridostigmine ) prognosis Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome . Longer-term study need ass promising therapy .</detailed_description>
