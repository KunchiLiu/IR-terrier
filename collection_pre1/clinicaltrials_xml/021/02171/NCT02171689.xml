	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate metabolism pharmacokinetics BIBW 2992 MA2 single oral dose [ 14C ] -radiolabelled BIBW 2992 MA2 healthy male volunteer . Metabolites human plasma excretion measure , structure metabolite analyse compare metabolite animal . In addition , mass-balance excretion , protein bind [ 14C ] -radioactivity , plasma concentration BIBW 2992 MA2 , [ 14C ] -radioactivity blood cell , plasma , urine faeces measure . The safety tolerability BIBW 2992 also investigate .</brief_summary>
