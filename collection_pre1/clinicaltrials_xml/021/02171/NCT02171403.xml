	<brief_summary>Most people bear ability digest lactose , dissacharide consist β-D-glucose β-D-galactose , presence lactase brush border small intestine . In 75 % world population activity enzyme decrease wean ( primary hypolactasia lactase-nonpersistence ) , result incomplete digestion lactose lactose malabsorption adulthood ( 1 ) . Secondary form lactose malabsorption may due inflammation functional loss intestinal mucosa celiac disease , infectious enteritis Crohn 's disease . Very rarely , lactase deficiency congenital due autosomal recessive genetic disorder , prevent lactase expression birth ( 2 ) . Whereas people lactose malabsorption asymptomatic , lactose-nonpersisters experience symptom like abdominal pain , bloating , excess flatulence diarrhea . Lactose intolerance refers syndrome one symptoms consumption lactose-containing food ( 3 ) . At present , origin symptom lactose-intolerance well understood . Several study indicate poor correlation lactose maldigestion symptom lactose intolerance ( 4 ) . In study Vonk et al . ( 2003 ) , lactose intolerant subject severe symptom ( diarrhea ) intolerant subject mild symptom ( without diarrhea ) differ degree lactose digestion small intestine indicate similar lactase activity lead hypothesis `` colon resistence factor '' ( 5 ) . It suggest colonic processing maldigested lactose may play role symptom experience lactose intolerant patient . When lactose malabsorbed enters colon , rapidly ferment resident microbiota variety metabolites include lactate , formate , succinate short chain fatty acid ( SCFA , acetate , propionate , butyrate ) well gas ( H2 , CO2 CH4 ) . When incubate fecal sample lactose-tolerant intolerant subject lactose , sample lactose-intolerant subject show fast production rate D- L-lactate , acetate , propionate butyrate , compare tolerant subject ( 6 ) . Although colon think possess high capacity absorb SCFA , hypothesize temporary accumulation metabolite due rapid fermentation maldigested lactose could responsible abdominal pain , excess flatulence bloating ( 7 ; 8 ) . Possible mechanism propose explain SCFA might induce symptom included increase osmotic load draw fluid colonic lumen , change colonic motility increase colonic sensitivity ( 9-11 ) . However , calculate amount fluid drawn colon unlikely cause symptom consider high water absorb capacity colon effect SCFA colonic motility colonic sensitivity observe rat human . More recently , Campbell et al . introduce bacterial metabolic toxin hypothesis , state also bacterial metabolite , alcohol , aldehyde , acid ketone , result carbohydrate fermentation play role pathogenesis lactose-intolerance . These metabolite might inhibit bacterial growth affect eukaryotic cell ( 12 ) . In previous study relate colonic fermentation pattern parameter cytotoxicity , identify compound like propionic acid , medium chain fatty acid , 1-octanol heptanal prevalent cytotoxic sample ( 13 ) , support hypothesis Campbell et al . Therefore , seem necessary include SCFA , also metabolites , investigation pathogenesis lactose intolerance . Differences fermentation pattern might associate difference composition and/or activity intestinal microbiota . Evidence potential role colonic microbiota lactose intolerance limit . Total bacterial number significantly different 16 intolerant 11 tolerant lactose maldigesters although negative correlation total bacteria symptom score found ( 14 ) . Similarly , composition fecal microbiota different 5 intolerant 7 tolerant subject ( 6 ) .</brief_summary>
