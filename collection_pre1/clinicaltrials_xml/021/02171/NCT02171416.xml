	<brief_summary>Cold contact urticaria ( CCU ) frequent form physical urticaria characterize development wheal flare type skin reaction due release histamine proinflammatory mast cell mediator follow exposure skin cold . Typically , symptom occur within minute cold contact , include exposure cold air , liquid object limit cold expose skin area . The investigator postulate overlap acquire cold urticaria cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome , cold urticaria patient unresponsive antihistamine benefit IL-1 target treatment strategy . This study evaluate efficacy safety IL-1 transfusion protein rilonacept patient cold contact urticaria could successfully treat first-line medication antihistamine . This double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group phase II study efficacy safety rilonacept subject CCU . A total 20 patient include Urticaria specialty clinic ACC . The total duration study course patient 14 week divide : 1 . Screening period ( 2 week , day -14-0 ) 2 . Placebo-controlled double-blind phase ( Part A , 6 week , day 0-42 ) 3 . Open label phase ( Part B , 6 week , day 42-84 ) All eligible patient randomize ( 1:1 randomization ) one two group : 1 ) Rilonacept 160mg/week 2 ) Placebo , receive respective dose subcutaneously . Following placebo-controlled double-blind phase patient enter open-label phase receive rilonacept open-label treatment ( 160mg 320mg depend treatment response part A ) .</brief_summary>
