	<brief_summary>Physical activity ( PA ) recommend treatment subject type 2 diabetes increase insulin sensitivity improve metabolic control . However , adherence PA often poor , due lack motivation due disable complication comorbidities . Neuromuscular electrostimulation ( NMES ) physical treatment commonly use improve muscle strength volume several situation : stroke , limb trauma chest rehabilitation deconditioned patient . The investigator already show first pilot study ( manuscript preparation ) NMES improve insulin sensitivity : study ELECTRODIAB ( No . ID-RCB : 2011-A00930-41 ) , investigator show 25 % insulin sensitivity improvement week daily 25-min bi-quadricipital NMES session , population patient orally-treated type 2 diabetes . Insulin sensitivity increase 50 % deconditioned subject . Discrepancy result low energy expenditure measure session suggest metabolic effect solely mediate muscle contraction . The investigator hypothesize involvement neurological pathway . Indeed , demonstrate autonomic nervous system important regulator glucose metabolism pancreatic action , key role energy metabolism complex relationship insulin resistance . Muscle activity , whether static ( isometric ) dynamic cause change sympathetic nerve activity healthy subject effect type 2 diabetic subject know . The investigator hypothesize , type 2 diabetic subject , modulation sympathetic nerve activity NMES could involve improvement insulin sensitivity . To address question , investigator propose assess sympathetic nerve activity gold standard method microneurography single bi-quadricipital NMES session . The impact neuro-electro-stimulation ( NES ) ( sensitive stimulation muscular threshold ) impact voluntary isometric muscle contraction ( VC ) also evaluate . These procedure also apply healthy control subject .</brief_summary>
