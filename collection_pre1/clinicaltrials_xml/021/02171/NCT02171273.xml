	<brief_title>Impact Chronic Circadian Disruption v . Chronic Sleep Restriction Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It long recognize sleep pattern change age . A common feature age advance timing sleep earlier hour , often earlier desire . These age-related change find even healthy individual take medication free sleep disorder . In addition sleep disturbance , many old individual curtail sleep voluntarily , report similar rate sleep restriction ( sleep less 7 less 6 hour per night ) compare young adult . Whether voluntary , insufficient sleep medical , safety metabolic consequence . In fact , converge evidence young adult suggest sleep restriction per se may impair metabolism , reduce sleep duration associate weight gain , obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , mortality . An understanding circadian sleep homeostatic neurobiological process respond increase homeostatic sleep pressure , effect sleep restriction metabolism different age , provide information regulation sleep metabolism age , well direction future treatment . In present study , study separate impact chronic sleep restriction ( minimize circadian disruption ) chronic circadian disruption ( minimize sleep disruption ) metabolism .</detailed_description>
