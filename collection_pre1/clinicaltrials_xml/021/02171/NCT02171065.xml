	<brief_summary>The present study two component , overall prospective observational study use multimodality imaging ( PROSPECT II ) examine natural history patient unstable atherosclerotic coronary artery disease specific goal establish utility low risk intracoronary imaging modality , Intravascular Ultrasound ( IVUS ) Near InfraRed Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , identify plaque prone future rupture clinical event . Due difficulty interpret IVUS image , study , however , use Plaque Burden ( PB ) ≥65 % primary threshold define vulnerable plaque . However , sensitivity analysis run patient lesion PB≥70 % . The randomized PROSPECT ABSORB sub-study examine whether treatment vulnerable plaque ABSORB Bioresobable Vascular Scaffold ( BVS ) plus Guideline Directed Medical Therapy ( GDMT ) safely increase Minimal Lumean Diameter ( MLA ) 25 month compare GDMTalone .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>PROSPECT II 1 . Troponin positive ACS ( STEMI &gt; 12 h NSTEMI ) occur within prior 2 week enrollment , symptoms consistent acute ischemia last &gt; 10 minute , intend angiography Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) appropriate . 2 . Patient must onevessel , twovessel threevessel disease native coronary artery require PCI . 3 . Successful PCI 1 . Known estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min . 2 . Cardiogenic shock , decompensated hypotension heart failure require intubation , inotropes , intravenous diuretic hemodynamic support device . 3 . Patient known hypersensitivity , allergy contraindication follow : aspirin , heparin bivalirudin , 3 clopidogrel , prasugrel ticagrelor , contrast adequately premedicated . 4 . Refractory ventricular arrhythmia ( e.g . ventricular tachycardia fibrillation ) require either intravenous pharmacologic treatment defibrillation index PCI procedure . 5 . Persistent acute conduction system disease require temporary pacemaker insertion index PCI procedure . 6 . Prior Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) time plan CABG . 7 . PCI require leave main coronary artery , leave main stenosis present visually estimate angiographic Diameter Stenosis ( DS ) &gt; 30 % . 8 . Angiographic evidence severe calcification and/or mark tortuosity target ( culprit ) nonculprit vessel present would preclude feasibility safe image least proximal 6 cm vessel . 9 . The presence chronic total occlusion major epicardial coronary vessel successfully recanalized PCI procedure , thus would preclude intravascular imaging . PROSPECT ABSORB one eligible lesion identify meet follow angiographic criterion : 1 . The lesion de novo lesion ( may locate either target nontarget vessel ) 2 . The lesion angiographic diameter stenosis &lt; 70 % , intend revascularization base angiographic criterion Fractional Flow Reserve/Instantaneous wavefree ratio ( FFR/iFR ) . Note : FFR/iFR perform noncritical lesion great 40 % visually estimate angiographic stenosis candidate ABSORB substudy . 3 . The lesion sitedetermined IVUS plaque burden least one frame ≥70 % . Note : Such lesion may may angiographically evident ; i.e . visually estimate angiographic diameter stenosis may range 0 % &lt; 70 % . 4 . The reference vessel diameter eligible lesion ≥2.5 mm ≤4.0 mm ( visually estimate ) capable treat 2.5 mm , 3.0 mm , 3.5 mm diameter BVS . 5 . The lesion length eligible lesion ≤50 mm ( visually estimate ) , capable treat two BVS ( maximum length BVS 28 mm ) , allow 2 mm BVS overlap 2 mm `` normal '' reference segment treatment edge . 6 . The lesion must least 10 mm previously implant stent/scaffold intervene 10 mm segment must plaque burden ( PB ) &gt; 50 % 7 . A bifurcation lesion may enrol side branch ) ≤2.5 mm reference vessel diameter , AND b ) either lesion requiring treatment , atherosclerotic disease limit within 5 mm origin parent vessel operator believe side branch successfully treat balloon angioplasty ( without stent ) . If stent subsequently become necessary , metallic drugeluting stent ( DES ; XIENCE strongly recommend ) may use treat side branch Tstent technique . 8 . Randomization must occur immediately 3vessel image run PROSPECT II protocol . If patient randomizes BVS , BVS placement must perform immediately randomization . 1 . The randomized lesion within 10 mm lesion previously treat PCI . 2 . The randomized lesion may leave main coronary artery . 3 . The randomized lesion may ostial Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery ( LAD ) ostial Left Circumflex Coronary Artery ( LCX ) lesion ( define within 3 mm leave main coronary artery ) . 4 . The randomized lesion may ostial Right Coronary Artery ( RCA ) lesion ( define within 3 mm aortoostium ) . 5 . Angiographic evidence severe calcification and/or mark tortuosity target vessel and/or lesion intend randomization present would make unlikely BVS could advance across lesion adequately expand .</criteria>
