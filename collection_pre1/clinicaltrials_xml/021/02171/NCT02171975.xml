	<detailed_description>Spinal anesthesia widely perform use surface landmark base 'blind ' technique . Multiple pass attempt administer spinal anesthesia associate great incidence post dural-puncture headache , paraesthesia spinal hematoma . Real time pre-procedural neuraxial ultrasound technique use improve success rate spinal anesthesia . The use real time ultrasound-guided spinal anesthesia date limit case series case report . Its use may limit requirement wide bore needle technical difficulty associate simultaneous ultrasound scan needle advancement . The use pre-procedural ultrasound show increase first pass success rate spinal anesthesia patient difficult surface anatomic landmarks.No technique show improve success rate dural puncture apply routinely patient . Studies pre-procedural ultrasound-guided spinal technique limit midline approach use transverse median view ( TM ) . The parasagittal oblique ( PSO ) view consistently offer well ultrasound view neuraxis compare TM view . However study conduct ass whether superior PSO view translate easy paramedian needle insertion . We hypothesise routine use pre-procedural ultrasound-guided paramedian spinal technique result less number pass require enter subarachnoid space compare conventional landmark base midline approach .</detailed_description>
