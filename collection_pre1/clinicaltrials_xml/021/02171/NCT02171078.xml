	<detailed_description>Our project involve three primary goal : 1 . Use exist data clinical trial sponsor one lead cancer cooperative group evaluate risk recurrence side effect treatment vary base patient cancer characteristic . 2 . Use exist data evaluate effectiveness late image technology improve survival patient previously treat breast cancer . 3 . Engage cancer survivor , provider , health outcome researcher development improve patient-centered approach guide post-treatment care , well identification high priority strategy prospective randomize trial . Methods Our method develop base input patient stakeholder identify need large-scale observational study .
