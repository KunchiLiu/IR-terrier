	<brief_title>BeatMG : Phase II Trial Rituximab In Myasthenia Gravis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators plan conduct multicenter randomize , double-blind , placebo control Phase II clinical trial utilize futility design . The study would include acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) antibody positive generalize MG subject . This study also present unique opportunity study drug disease mechanism unlike many autoimmune disease rituximab use , MG affords investigation antigen-specific component participate immunopathology disease , namely autoantibody , autoantibody-producing B cell , antigen-specific T cell . This work understand MG immunopathology represent first step toward gain complete understand immune mechanism underlie treatment MG rituximab lead new way treat disease . In order ass safety B cell recovery repopulation period well assess long-term durability response , two additional optional observational study-intervention time point ( week 72 96 ) . The subject treat per medical standard care period . The specific aim study determine whether rituximab safe effective treatment subject MG .</detailed_description>
