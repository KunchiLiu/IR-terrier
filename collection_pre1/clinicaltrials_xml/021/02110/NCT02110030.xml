	<brief_summary>Objective : The investigator aim compare effectiveness transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) interferential current ( IC ) improve shoulder functionality reduce perceive pain patient subacromial impingement syndrome ( SIS ) . Design : Thirty-six patient unilateral shoulder pain diagnose SIS randomly assign two group : TENS ( n=18 ; 51±7 year ) IC ( n=18 ; 47±6 year ) . Patients group receive fifteen 30-min session assign treatment period 3 week . Before treatment , shoulder pain measure use 100-mm visual analog scale shoulder functionality measure use Constant-Murley scale .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects The subject study recruit wait list patient acute shoulder pain Almendrales Medicine Physiotherapy Center ( Madrid , Spain ) . To included list old 18 year unilateral shoulder pain 1 month . Potential participant examine independent specialist diagnosis SIS make accord Hawkins Jobe test . The use X-ray , ultrasonography magnetic resonance imaging permit objective diagnosis SIS exclusion patient shoulder pathology . With inclusion criterion , total 63 patient recruited experiment . The following participant exclude investigation : individual rotator cuff tear calcification ; individual presence acute trauma ; patient receive treatment SIS another method ; patient previous surgery intra-articular injection ; individual contraindication electrotherapy . Ethical approval experiment previously obtain local Institutional Review participant sign informed consent prior enrol investigation . Treatment group The experimental design randomize double-blind clinical trial . After preliminary examination , patient randomly assign two group : transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) interferential current ( IC ) . A set seal sequentially numbered opaque envelope use group assignment . The study double-blind examiner contact patient duration treatment patient informed electrotherapy technique receive investigation . Intervention For experimental group , treatment apply period 3 week , include total 15 session ( approximately 5 session per week ) . In session , electrical stimulation technique administer 30 minute subject comfortable seat adjustable chair . The group TENS receive electrical stimulation ( Endomed 182 , Enraf-nonius , Germany ) frequency 80 Hz pulse width 150 n . The TENS apply use 4 surface electrode ( 5x5 cm Prim-Trode , Spain ) two channel : supraspinatus fossa insertion rotator cuff ( channel 1 ) `` V '' deltoid `` ( channel 2 ) . The current intensity set 3 time session accord patient 's sensitivity . Current strong exceed threshold pain . The group IC receive base frequency 4000 Hz ( Endomed 182 , Enraf-nonius , Germany ) amplitude-modulated frequency ( AMF ) slope 1/1 tetrapolar mode , previously indicate . For IC , number type surface electrode ( 5x5 cm Prim-Trode , Spain ) place onto anterior posterior deltoid , supraspinatus fossa `` V '' deltoid . Similarly , intensity current set 3 time per session stimulation strong comfortable ( without exceed threshold pain ) . The treatment administer experienced physiotherapist blind aim investigation . Outcome measurement Shoulder pain evaluate day end treatment use 100 mm visual analog pain scale . Functional status shoulder joint evaluate two day , 8 session treatment day end treatment use Constant-Murley scale . This scale valid ass overall functionality normal , diseased treat shoulder . In scale , 35 % total value allocate subjective assessment pain ( 20 % ) self-evaluation activity daily live ( 15 % ; include shoulder pain sleeping , dysfunction free time sport dysfunction work activity ) . The remain 65 % total value come objective measure range movement shoulder strength . Within objective evaluation , range motion internal external rotation , arm flexion lateral elevation ( measure use inclinometer ) amount 10 % total score . Strength measure use muscular balance system Daniels30 count 25 % total score . Thus , young healthy patient maximal punctuation 100 point . The pre-to-post treatment shoulder evaluation perform independent experimenter use instrument . This experimenter blind treatment assign participant . Statistical analysis All data analyze use SPSS v.20 statistical package . Descriptive statistic calculate group ( mean standard deviation ) . Normality test Shapiro-Wilk test . All variable present normal distribution test ( P &gt; 0.05 ) . Baseline characteristic compare use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) measure independent data . Pre-to-post treatment data comparison group perform use two-way ANOVA ( group x time ) . After significant F test , difference mean identified use Tukey 's HSD post hoc procedure . The level significance establish P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
