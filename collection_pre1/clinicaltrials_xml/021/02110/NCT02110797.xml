Mutations MECP2 gene find 95 % RETT patient preliminary experimental study show lead abnormal expression gene code osteoprotegerin , protein implicate bone remodelling interact RANK-ligand . In order identify risk factor osteoporosis RETT syndrome understand pathophysiological mechanism study protocol include : 1 . Clinical evaluation bone health ( history bone fracture , pain , nutritional status , pubertal stage , daily caloric/calcium intake , anti-epileptic drug , walk ability , vitamin D satus ) 2. evaluation mineral density lumber spine use DEXA 3. measure concentration osteoprotegerin RANK-ligand</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based clinical observation , many girl RETT syndrome , severe neuro-developmental encephalopathy , suffer osteoporosis appear early age ( age 10 ) lead fracture , pain limitation mobility . Few epidemiological study estimate frequency osteoporosis girl RETT syndrome show exposed osteoporosis child neuro-developmental disease degree neurological handicap . However , mechanism lead early osteoporosis RETT syndrome remain unknown . Mutations MECP2 gene find 95 % RETT patient . Preliminary experimental study transcriptional consequence MECP2 mutation show expression 13 gene significantly dysregulated one gene code osteoprotegerin , soluble receptor bind RANK-ligand . RANK-ligand osteoclastic differentiation factor express osteoblast . In order identify risk factor osteoporosis RETT syndrome understand pathophysiological mechanism study protocol include : 1 . Clinical evaluation bone health ( history bone fracture , pain , nutritional status , pubertal stage , daily caloric/calcium intake , anti-epileptic drug , walk ability , vitamin D status ) 2. evaluation mineral density lumber spine use DEXA 3. measure concentration osteoprotegerin RANK-ligand</detailed_description>
