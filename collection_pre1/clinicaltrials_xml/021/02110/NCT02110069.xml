	<brief_summary>In research study want learn treatment work well patient diagnose vascular tumor call Kaposiform Hemangioendothelioma ( KHE ) high risk vascular tumor Tufted Angioma ( TA ) . In tumor , blood cell help blood clot call platelet become trapped tumor cause swell , pain , bruising . Vascular tumor life threaten . There medical treatment work shrink vascular tumor . Some doctor use steroid vincristine try shrink vascular tumor . In research study , study doctor compare two different drug see one work well help shrink vascular tumor . One drug vincristine . Vincristine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat people cancer . Vincristine use stop abnormal cell grow cell make blood vessel . The drug use study sirolimus . Sirolimus currently approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) prevent transplant organ rejection . Sirolimus approve FDA treatment vascular abnormality consider experimental . Sirolimus belong class drug call 'mTOR inhibitor ' . mTOR ( mammilian target rapamycin ) help cell grow may also help blood vessel grow normal fashion . Sirolimus currently test patient vascular tumor cancer . In vascular tumor , hope sirolimus stop blood vessel growth .

	<brief_title>A Study Compare Vincristine Sirolimus Treatment High Risk Vascular Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas ( KHE ) extremely rare life threaten tumor associate Kasabach-Merritt Phenomenon consist profound thrombocytopenia hypofibrinogenemia cause significant risk bleeding associate mortality rate high 20 % 30 % . Despite severity potential complication , lack uniform guideline treatment response treatment child young adult tumor . KHE patient treat multitude aggressive drug regimen without prospective evaluation response safety . Presently , vincristine consider standard practice . We treat subset patient study SIR-DA-0901 ( FDA Grant # 5RO1FD003712-01 ) . This study phase II trial assess efficacy safety sirolimus treatment complicate vascular anomaly . Although number small , response extremely promising excellent tolerability . There pre-clinical clinical data support essential regulatory function PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway vascular growth organization suggest therapeutic target patient complicate vascular anomaly . The overall goal trial objectively assess efficacy sirolimus compare vincristine treatment patient high risk KHE . Hypothesis : Sirolimus treatment child young adult Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas effective vincristine , assess time response induction period provide equivalent safety parameter . Study Rationale We propose multi-center , phase II trial participation 8 site . The study consist two phase . The first initial induction phase vincristine steroid compare sirolimus steroid . Response induction phase assess time hematologic response . At end induction phase , cross occur failure respond . Part 2 maintenance phase 1 year length . Continued safety efficacy data collect maintenance cross time patient lose response follow induction . Failure define worsen hematological parameter two separate laboratory evaluation time maintenance meet definition progressive disease follow response assessment . Formal response maintenance evaluate image study , functional assessment , quality life per study SIR-DA-0901 . Present therapy limit new therapy desperately need devastating disease . Based preliminary data , good rationale sirolimus therapy KHE patient phase II trial urgently need determine therapy become new standard care KHE patient . Our secondary aim address biomarker analysis . There limited study describe biology tumor . Per study SIR-DA-0901 preliminary data indicate importance VEGF-C upregulated marker mTor pathway . This need investigate especially KHE patient . Furthermore clear objective measurement determine response data .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : All patient must one follow vascular anomaly determine clinical , radiologic histologic criterion ( possible ) . Biopsy strongly recommend ( require ) suggest immunostains : CD34 , PROX1 D240 , Glut1 MIB1 . 1 . Kaposiform Hemangioendotheliomas 2 . Tufted angioma High Risk Stratification : In addition diagnosis , follow criterion need meet : a. Kasabach Merritt Syndrome define platelet count less 50,000 K/µl and/or fibrinogen level &lt; 100 mg/dl time diagnosis . Age : Patients must 0 31 year age time study entry . Enrollment include patient gender ethnic group . Organ function requirement : 1 . Adequate liver function define : 1 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN age , 2 . SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 5 x ULN age , 3 . Serum albumin &gt; /= 2 g/dL . 4 . Fasting LDL cholesterol &lt; 160 mg/dL 5 . Fasting triglyceride &lt; 400 mg/dl 2 . Adequate Bone Marrow Function define : 1 . Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1000/uL 2 . Hemoglobin &gt; /= 8.0 g/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) 3 . No Platelet requirement 3 . Adequate Renal Function Defined : 1 . A serum creatinine base age follow : Age ( Years ) Maximum Serum Creatinine ( mg/dL ) 5 0.8 6 ≤10 1.0 11 ≤15 1.2 &gt; 15 1.5 2 . Urine protein creatinine ratio ( UPC ) &lt; 0.3 g/l Performance Status : Karnofsky &gt; /= 50 ( ≥16 year age ) Lansky &gt; /= 50 patient &lt; 16 year age . Prior therapy 1 . Patients undergone surgical resection interventional radiology procedure disease control eligible meet inclusion criterion surgery/procedure 2 . Surgery : At least 2 week since undergo major surgery 3 . Radiation : &gt; 6 month involve field radiation 4 . Prior vincristine therapy permit . Patients may also receive 2 dos vincristine prior randomization . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease could compromise participation study ( e.g . uncontrolled diabetes , uncontrolled hypertension , severe infection , severe malnutrition , chronic liver renal disease , active upper GI tract ulceration ) . Patients require medication strong inhibitors/inducers CYP3A4 enzyme activity , include anticonvulsant , ( Appendix II ) control concurrent medical condition eligible . Patients discontinue use prohibit medication one week washout prior start study treatment eligible . Known history HIV seropositivity know immunodeficiency . Testing required unless condition suspect . Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption sirolimus ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) . A gastric tube nasogastric tube allow . Females pregnant breast feeding .
