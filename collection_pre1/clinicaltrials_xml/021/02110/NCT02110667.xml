	<brief_summary>This study do find transperineal ultrasound ( TPUS ) help define prostate bed radiation treatment plan improve upon current method image guidance treatment prostate cancer . For patient , TPUS involve placement ultrasound probe perineum , skin scrotum anus , lie back position receive treatment . Image-guidance required treatment prostate cancer prostate bed shifts position depend full bladder rectum . Image-guided radiation therapy do Fletcher Allen Health Care approximately three year . Most commonly , transabdominal ultrasound image obtain every day compare ultrasound do day treatment planning . Adjustments radiation field position do daily basis comparing image . Transperineal ultrasound never use image-guidance . We complete two phase earlier study develop TPUS device process allow u get clear ultrasound picture prostate gland , would like explore image prostate bed leave radical prostatectomy.The TPUS three potential advantage transabdominal method currently use : 1 . Transabdominal ultrasound challenge men . A full bladder help u get clear image , however difficult men prostate cancer comfortably keep full bladder . It also particularly difficult get good image large men long distance skin surface prostate bed . TPUS dependent man full bladder less dependent size man . 2 . TPUS image plan CT image acquire simultaneously . This possible abdominal probe get way CT machine . Simultaneous image eliminates possibility prostate bed shift position time image study . 3 . TPUS place acquire image patient treatment ( abdominal probe get way treatment machine ) may future allow u watch prostate bed treatment . If discover accurately view prostate bed real time , TPUS may ultimately allow u treat even small radiation field possibly decrease risk radiation complication . Patients study treated prostate cancer standard image guidance technique use Fletcher Allen Health Care : transabdominal ultrasound . In addition , one TPUS scan acquire time initial simulation . To summarize , two objective study : 1 . To determine TPUS acquire usable , clinically pertinent IGRT image prostate bed . 2 . To preliminarily compare TPUS image prostate bed image obtain CT TAUS .</brief_summary>
