	<brief_summary>Epilepsy episodic disorder result recurrent seizure often associate hypertonia ( muscle stiffen ) myoclonia ( involuntary muscle jerking ) . Hypertonia often occur full expression seizure detection hypertonia could act alarm epilepsy patient carers order prepare seizure event . Secondly , record device seizure frequency duration valuable clinical tool collect data clinician manage disorder primary tertiary care . The investigator develop portable prototype hypertonia detection use non-invasive , muscle activate , sensor record seizure activity . The investigator want test sensor system patient identify Consultant Clinician Custodians within Wales Epilepsy Research Network ( WERN ) . The Epidetect® prototype develop VIKEL LTD™ collaboration WERN - Welsh Assembly fund network .</brief_summary>
