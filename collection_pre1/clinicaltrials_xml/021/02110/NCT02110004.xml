	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible participation clinical investigation . 1 . Age &gt; 18 year old . 2 . Patients sign Patient Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) 3 . Patients schedule undergo clinicallyindicated catheter ablation procedure management complex arrhythmia . ( Patients undergone previous ablation procedure may include . ) 4 . Subjects fail least one antiarrhythmic drug ( AAD ) ( include AV nodal block agent beta blocker calcium channel blocker ) evidence recurrent symptomatic complex arrhythmia , intolerable AAD 5 . Complex arrhythmia ( include atrial fibrillation , atypical flutter , ventricular tachycardia ) define patient diagnose complex arrhythmia anytime within last 5 year prior enrolment . Symptoms may include , restrict , palpitation , shortness breath , chest pain , fatigue , leave ventricular dysfunction , symptom , combination . 6 . At least one episode complex arrhythmia must document ECG , Holter , loop recorder , telemetry , implanted device , transtelephonic monitoring within 12 month enrollment . 7 . Able willing comply pre , post , followup testing requirement . Subjects meet follow exclusion criterion eligible enrollment . 1 . A complex arrhythmia secondary reversible cause . 2 . Atrial arrhythmia : patient leave atrial size &gt; 55 mm ( echocardiography , parasternal long axis view ) . 3 . Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction &lt; 25 % 4 . NYHA Class III IV 5 . Significant congenital anomaly medical problem opinion investigator would preclude enrollment study . 6 . Atrial arrhythmia : patient structural atrial disease prior history atriotomy prior atrial surgery , presence atrial septal defect , and/or presence atrial septal closure patch . 7 . History current blood clot bleed abnormality , contraindication systemic anticoagulation ( i.e. , heparin , warfarin , dabigatran , direct thrombin inhibitor ) 8 . Subjects ever undergo valvular cardiac surgical procedure ( ie , ventriculotomy , atriotomy , valve repair replacement presence prosthetic valve ) 9 . Any cardiac surgery within past 60 day ( 2 month ) ( include PCI ) 10 . Concurrent enrollment study evaluate another device drug . 11 . A complex arrhythmia secondary electrolyte imbalance , thyroid disease , noncardiac cause . 12 . Presence intracardiac thrombus myxoma , interatrial baffle patch , tumor abnormality precludes catheter introduction manipulation . 13 . Presence condition precludes vascular access . 14 . Women child bear potential pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course clinical investigation 15 . Active illness active systemic infection sepsis .</criteria>
