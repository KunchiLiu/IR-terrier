	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose irinotecan-eluting bead treat patient colon rectal cancer spread liver respond treatment standard therapy . Irinotecan-eluting bead tiny bead load irinotecan hydrochloride , chemotherapy drug . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . This treatment deliver chemotherapy directly tumor area inside liver instead whole body systemic delivery drug . Irinotecan-eluting bead may work well standard chemotherapy treat patient colon rectal cancer spread liver .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan-Eluting Beads Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Colon Rectal Cancer That Has Spread Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerated dose drug elute irinotecan ( irinotecan hydrochloride ) bead ( irinotecan-eluting bead ) , deliver intrahepatically treatment liver liver-predominantly colorectal metastatic disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate colorectal liver metastasis treat drug-eluting irinotecan bead refractory metastatic colorectal patient liver liver predominant disease . II . To determine time progression colorectal liver metastasis treat drug-eluting irinotecan bead refractory metastatic colorectal patient liver liver predominant disease . III . To determine overall survival patient treat drug-eluting irinotecan bead liver liver predominant metastatic disease colorectal cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive irinotecan-eluting bead via hepatic artery embolization every 3 week total 2 treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients bi-lobular disease evidence progression treat lobe may repeat treatment discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
