	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer cause high mortality gynecologic cancer although second common gynecologic malignancy . Ovarian cancer usually detect early Stage III IV usually asymptomatic ; yet survival high early stage disease . In addition , woman pelvic mass note ultrasound undergo oophorectomy 1-3 % risk malignancy thus 97-99 % overtreated inability reliably differentiate benign malignant mass ultrasound . BRCA1 test family history identify certain high-risk individual high risk malignancy need modality reliable detect early cancer provide accurate surveillance.We develop new transvaginal imaging device optimize ovarian cancer detection , diagnosis validate ex vivo vivo clinical study . This automated system may provide early diagnostic tool ovarian cancer future .</detailed_description>
