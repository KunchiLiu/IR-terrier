	<brief_summary>Carbohydrate store body glycogen , mainly find liver muscle . During endurance exercise , muscle glycogen use fuel work muscle liver glycogen broken provide glucose maintain blood glucose ( sugar ) level . Both liver muscle glycogen important ability perform intense/prolonged endurance exercise . Therefore , nutritional strategy maximise availability glycogen muscle liver benefit endurance exercise capacity . The carbohydrate typically find sport drink glucose sometimes fructose . If glucose ingested exercise , maximum rate absorb intestine blood stream ~1 g/min . However , different source carbohydrate ( fructose ) use , absorbed different pathway , absorption carbohydrate ~1.8 g/min . With carbohydrate available fuel , translate improvement performance . Sucrose naturally occur sugar make single glucose single fructose molecule . Therefore , theoretically , use two different pathway absorption also maximise carbohydrate delivery . It yet know however , impact liver muscle glycogen store exercise . Therefore aim study ass whether sucrose ingestion influence liver muscle glycogen depletion endurance exercise .</brief_summary>
