	<brief_summary>Despite globally favourable outcome Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) , significant proportion Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) patient obtain adequate coverage low back pain . Peripheral Nerve Stimulation ( PNS ) obtain European Conformity mark treatment chronic refractory neuropathic pain commonly use country target back pain . However , potential value combine SCS PNS `` hybrid stimulation '' remain poorly describe isolated case report limit experience various indication . The `` CUMPNS '' comparative randomize study design demonstrate potential analgesic efficacy PNS addition previously implant SCS , treat residual low back pain component pain refractory FBSS patient .</brief_summary>
