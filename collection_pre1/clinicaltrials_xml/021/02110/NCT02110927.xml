	<brief_title>Microcurrent Aerobic Exercise Effects Abdominal Fat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nutritional pattern change twenty-first century sugar fat 's high proportion ally sedentary lifestyle increase body fat . There already well establish relationship total body fat excess , cardiometabolic disease increase mortality , know abdominal fat ( android pattern ) , different body index , present additional influence health risk . Women abdominal adipocytes ( visceral fat ) show increase lipolytic activity release free fat acid systemic portal circulation lead metabolic syndrome , increase risk cardiovascular disease . Aerobic exercise way decrease fat stimulates lipolysis increase catecholamine 's level result sympathetic system nervous activity raise . The used exercise lipid elimination prolong aerobic moderate exercise minimum 30 minute . Nevertheless aerobic exercise practice reduce globally lipidic source locally . Electrolipolysis use microcurrent use clinical practice technique reduce abdominal fat . This technique apply transcutaneously percutaneously seem former effective skin obstacle current effect visceral subcutaneous fat . Abdominal fat excess associate cardiometabolic disease prevent use microcurrent aerobic exercise stimulate lipolysis .</detailed_description>
