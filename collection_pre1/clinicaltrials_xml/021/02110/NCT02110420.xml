	<brief_title>First-in-human Study Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Single Multiple Ascending Doses CC-90001</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-part study conduct single study center . Part 1 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics CC-90001 follow single oral dose healthy subject . During course Part 1 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase follow visit . There total 7 plan cohort , consist different dose level , 8 subject per cohort . In cohort , 6 subject receive dose CC 90001 2 subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . Administration study drug next high dose level begin safety tolerability precede dose evaluate deem acceptable investigator sponsor 's medical monitor . Part 2 randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics CC-90001 follow multiple oral dos healthy subject . Only dose safe well tolerated Part 1 administer Part 2 . During course Part 2 , subject participate screening phase , baseline phase , treatment phase follow visit . There total 6 plan cohort , consist different dose level , 8 subject per cohort . In cohort , 6 subject receive dose CC 90001 2 subject receive placebo depend randomization schedule . It plan study drug administer daily 14 day . Proposed dose level Part 2 may modify and/or eliminate base data obtain Part 1 ; however , maximum dose administer Part 2 exceed maximum tolerate dose Part 1 .</detailed_description>
