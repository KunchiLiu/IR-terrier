	<brief_summary>An estimate 76 million adult United States age 20 hypertension ( HTN ) ; translate 1 3 adult . Globally prevalence HTN 25 % adult , account approximately 13.5 % death . Given age population together increase obesity sedentary behavior , surprising HTN project increase significantly next several decade ; 1.5 billion adult HTN year 2025 . Thus public health implication prevent and/or reduce elevation blood pressure substantial . This study compare efficacy two different non-pharmacologic intervention ( device guide breathe isometric hand grip exercise ) use alone combination lower blood pressure . This pilot study include 30 adult stage 1 hypertension . The primary outcome change blood pressure baseline 8 week . Secondary outcome include change blood pressure 8 week 16 week acceptability intervention participant . The knowledge gain study provide information non-pharmacologic method may useful decrease blood pressure . Such knowledge may especially useful patient access medication health care limit among patient unwilling take intolerant pharmacologic therapy .</brief_summary>
