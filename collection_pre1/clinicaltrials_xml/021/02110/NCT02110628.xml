	<brief_summary>Gastric one prevalence digestive malignance tumor China . Radical resection primary tumor combine dissection regional lymph-nodes acknowledge surgeon world . Nowadays , order improve quality life , controversy still exist reconstruction method total gastrectomy . Although roux-en-y anastomosis common method adopt total gastrectomy easily safety method reconstruction method , problem still need u solve , little food reserve , less food intake per meal fast gastric empty . These problem significantly affect patient ' quality life surgery . Roux-en-Y+Jejunal pouch anastomosis newly bear method significant increase volume improve postoperative quality life proven little sample size randomize control trail With improvement gastric cancer surgery , study propose prospective randomize controlled clinical trial aim compare quality life traditional Roux-en-Y type Roux-en-Y+ Jejunal pouch type anastomosis radical total gastrectomy . Quality life evaluate accord European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Of Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) -C30 QLQ-STO22 . Quality life conduct 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month , 24 month , 36 month gastrectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consecutive patient participant unit satisfy inclusion/exclusion criterion inform detail , right , responsibility possible benefit potential risk join study . Those patient agree sign inform consent document randomize , consecutive case series sample . All patient study finish sample would must record Western China Gastric Cancer Collaboration database assign correspond treatment group . Randomization allocation After intraoperative exploration predictively D2 radical ( R0 ) total gastrectomy possible perform , assign randomly subject 1:1 basis either Roux-en-Y+Pouch group Roux-en-Y group . Surgical treatment Surgical approach : open total gastrectomy . Surgical treatment method : Radical total gastrectomy ( R0 ) ; D2 lymph-node dissection ( No.1 , 2 , 3 , 4sa , 4sb , 4d , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8a , 9 , 10 , 11p , 11d , 12a,19,20 ) ; Abscission pneumogastric nerve trunk . Reconstruction method : Group A ( Roux-en-Y type ) : close stump duodenum , cut jejunum 20cm Treitz ligament , esophagojejunal anastomosis ( duct-to-duct / duct-to-duct , colon/after colon ) , jejunum - jejunum anastomosis ( duct-to-duct / duct-to-duct ) , distance anastomotic 40cm-60cm ; Group B ( Roux-en-Y+Pouch type ) : close stump duodenum , cut jejunum 20cm Treitz ligament , pouch reconstruction J pouch length 15 cm construct connect 2 Jejunal lumen , œsophago-P type jejunum Storage bag anastomosis ( duct-to-duct / duct-to-duct , colon/after colon ) , jejunum - jejunum anastomosis ( duct-to-duct / duct-to-duct ) , distance anastomotic 40cm-60cm Quality control surgery : All surgical treatment perform member Western China Gastric Cancer Collaboration . Quality supervision within group avoid bias . Intraoperative photograph lymphadenectomy reconstruction digestive tract essential . Follow-up Database Follow-up programming : Postoperative follow-up assessment perform specially researcher arrange unit blind randomize allocation ; Postoperative long term follow-up conduct 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month , 24 month , 36 month gastrectomy ; Face face interview necessary postoperative quality life questionnaire do patient . Management database : The design study database responsible lead unit ; Each case study must uniform case report form , include demographic data , operation data , pathological information Postoperative quality life evaluation ; A file include Case Report Form ( CRF ) record follow-up information last three year surgery . Lost follow-up : Three year lose follow-up rate 10 % . Lost follow-up rate report final report , case lose follow-up take intention-to-treat ( ITT ) method analysis . Statistics analysis The measurement data strictly obey normal distribution present mean ( ±SD ) compare single factor analysis variance . The measurement data obey normal distribution present median compare Wilcoxon test . Categorical data present percentage compare Chi-square test .</detailed_description>
