	<brief_summary>Heart failure serious common disease . HF mark high rate preventable hospitalization proper care . As , key target telemedicine program . However , currently publish data inconclusive . Investigators propose multicenter randomize study innovative telemedicine involve usual patient monitor daily weight monitoring , clinical sign one three group study BNP test patient 's home associate regular education reinforcement . The objective identify early cardiac decompensation allow treat ambulatory thus prevent occurrence serious event death rehospitalization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure ( CHF ) disease several specificity . It common severe . This disease associate high mortality especially high rate hospitalization . These partly due severity `` per se `` disease also non optimal management CHF non-formal education patient caregiver . Indeed , majority hospitalize patient show clinical sign decompensation 5 day hospitalization could avoid go emergency room hospitalization adequate ambulatory reaction care . It premise underlies concept application telemedicine CHF . Telemedicine monitor biological clinical data patient 's home transfer information remotely either specific structure often manage nurse GP cardiologist . In study telemedicine , effectiveness concept base notion monitor marker low sensitivity specificity . This monitoring generate lot information , good education patient systematic examination technology ( internet , phone , SMS ) remote monitor nurse often lead detection source unnecessary hospitalization offset advantage gain early detection decompensation . In addition , low sensitivity specificity clinical sign generate many warning cause difficult remote management patient doctor . BNP blood biomarker recognize high negative predictive value diagnosis CHF rate change correlate change prognosis . Its dosage conventionally perform peripheral blood use POCT device . More recently , possible perform dosage patient home , include satisfactory feasibility . This , HELP study , Investigators want study impact addition BNP measurement patient 's home innovative device telemedicine monitor combine patient perception clinical sign HF decompensation , daily weight monitor strengthen patient education also specific train doctor E learn order promote implementation ESC recommendation . Study hypotheses The primary objective HELP study determine impact tele monitor strategy base either telemonitoring weight associate educational reinforcement ( clinical monitoring arm ) track associate BNP assay home perform patient every week case symptom suggestive decompensation ( bioclinical monitoring arm ) primary endpoint include death cause , unscheduled re-hospitalization CHF admission emergency department compare control group ( usual monitoring arm ) . Be secondarily analyze impact term re-hospitalizations , death emergency admission , number false positive ( unconfirmed suspect cardiac decompensation ) , false negative ( undetected cardiac decompensation ) , effect monitoring quality life economic impact medical strategy . Study design , inclusion , exclusion criterion HELP ( n° ansm 2013-A00899-36 ) multicentric , prospective , open label , randomize , ambulatory study . The author solely responsible design conduct study , study analysis , draft edit paper , final content . HELP study benefit form specific grant Ile de France regional health agency , France . The aim initially include 330 patient suffer ambulatory CHF accord inclusion exclusion criterion Study procedures Patients follow study investigator . After sign informed consent ( approval French legal ethical committee 8 th October 2013 N° 2013-A00899-36-3101 ) , patient randomize three arm accord type CHF ( systolic CHF CHF preserve systolic function define coexistence sign CHF ejection fraction &gt; 45 % ) . Patients therefore include standard care arm ( placebo group ) , one arm follow clinical telemonitoring arm ( Cordiva System ( R ) arm ) follow bio-clinical monitoring ( BNP Cordiva ( R ) monitoring system arm ) . Patients see per protocol inclusion 3 , 6 , 9 12 month inclusion . - Placebo arm group : Patients manage per consensus guideline Clinicians could see patient many time necessary order optimize therapy could make BNP measurement ( use Home BNP monitoring ) - Cordiva System ( R ) arm : Patient see cardiologist every three month benefit telemonitoring weight general well specific communicant device . Patients answer 8 specific binary question base main precipitating factor decompensation measure body weight every day . If contact two miss measure . Patient contact phone call every month order reinforce initial patient therapeutic education patient- 's compliance . Patient access specific print document specific web base platform find PowerPoint presentation CHF aetiology , sign therapy try answer monthly quiz question base key message CHF accord guideline consensus paper patient therapeutic education . The cardiologist access specific platform . In platform could find E CRF patient patient 's quiz result order help analyse patient comprehension HF patient reactivity case decompensation . The cardiologist could also find PowerPoint presentation CHF AHF management accord ESC guideline . He could also read monthly report telemonitoring nurse daily result weight general measurement patient . - BNP Cordiva ( R ) monitoring system arm : In group , patient doctor access platform detail also access BNP home monitoring . Patients measure BNP plasma level use Alere home base BNP device heartcheck weekly basis order follow parameter . In case clinical sign CHF significant weight increase identify tele monitoring patient , nurse ask patient extra measurement home BNP test order exclude CHF decompensation ( BNP &lt; 100 pg/ml remain stable ( &lt; 30 % increase ) . End Points Primary end point composite end point include Unplanned hospitalization CHF hospital stay &gt; 1 day / all-cause death / non-programmed emergency department admission relate CHF . Secondary endpoint base analysis impact strategy use two interventional arm compare placebo group : - parameter composite end point analyze separately - emergency admission . - Number cause death . - Number HF hospitalization - Patient management - Adherence strategy - Quality life . - False positive induced system ( visit GP cardiologist propose telemonitoring system without final evidence HF decompensation without increase diuretic ) - Medical cost efficience technique - Cost different strategy - Cost efficacy different strategy Hospitalization heart failure define per protocol in-hospital stay one night addition intravenous use diuretic . Statistical analysis Events three group analyze use parametric student test . Percentages compare use Chi2 test . Kaplan Meier time event function readmission death cause calculate . For end point , investigator also estimate hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval use Cox proportional-hazards To calculate sample size , analyze recent clinical trial data , investigator expect least 40 % SOC subject least one cardiovascular event within 1 year . Assuming 40 % reduction occurrence primary end point telemonitoring group , investigator estimate sample size least 110 subject group would provide 80 % power ( α = .05 ) detection reduction primary end point . An initial goal enrollment 330 subject propose . According event rate control group study size could secondarily extend 600 patient . Sub group analysis Actual prespecified sub group analysis define accord patient characteristics location : Investigators also test interaction pair subgroup main treatment effect . Age ( cut 65 old ) median value . PSEF versus REF ( define EF &gt; 45 % ) aetiology CHF define investigator High symptomatic patient vs low symptomatic patient accord NYHA class Heart failure unit management ( define investigator work structure ) v others High neurohormonal activation patient vs low neurohormonal activation define initial BNP high low 300 pg/ml second analysis median initial BNP value . patient adherence `` phone call system `` ( &lt; 75 % vs. ≥75 % ) BNP Compliant v non compliant patient define compliance daily measurement plus BNP measurement BNP group high 80 % . Highly implicate vs low implication patient define accord monthly connection patient site median value study . Good HF education level vs low HF education patient define tertile value quiz performance ( global , knowledge situation question isolate value ) .</detailed_description>
