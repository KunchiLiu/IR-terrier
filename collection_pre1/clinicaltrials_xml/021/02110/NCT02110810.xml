	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) widely accept therapy treat benign malignant disease pancreatobiliary tree . Acute pancreatitis represent common fear complication follow ERCP . The reported incidence complication 1 % 40 % accord presence high-risk factor complication presence dysfunction sphincter Oddi ( SOD ) . In prospective series , incidence range 3.5 % 20 % nonselected high-risk patient , respectively . Independent risk factor post-ERCP pancreatitis either patient- procedure-related .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design This randomized clinical trial carry patient schedule ERCP Department Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Department Gastroenterology Specialties Hospital Western Medical Center , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico . The investigator include patient elevated baseline risk post-ERCP pancreatitis base prospectively validated patient- procedure-related independent risk factor . The ERCP procedure perform patient topical pharyngeal anesthesia 2 % lidocaine administration sedation ( midazolam ) analgesia ( fentanyl ) intravenously , dosage discretion endoscopist . Patients receive complementary oxygen external nasal device 3 5 L/min infusion 200 500 mL 0.9 % sterile saline solution . The equipment protocol use perform ERCP consist video duodenoscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) , sphincterotome traction selective cannulation bile duct , needle scalpel perform precut sphincterotomy , hydrophilic guide wire via bile duct , Dormia basket and/or balloon catheter stone extraction , nonionic water-soluble contrast medium 300 mg/mL ( Optira 300â„¢ ; ioversol injection 64 % ; Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals , Dublin , Ireland ) opacification biliary pancreatic duct . Pancreatic stent use treat pancreatic fistula prevent pancreatitis . All patient monitor continuously procedure , determination blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , arterial blood oxygen saturation . Eligible patient provide write informed consent undergo randomization conclusion ERCP procedure patient without risk factor could include study base procedure-related factor alone . If patient meet inclusion criterion , randomly assign receive 100 mg suppository indomethacin 2.4 g glycerin suppository immediately afterwards still sedation . All patient observe prevent spontaneous expulsion suppository become completely awake . All patient , staff endoscopists , resident , researcher blind treatment assign . The following data collect . 1 . A clinical history , particularly patient-related risk factor post-ERCP pancreatitis ; blood test result determination basal amylase , liver enzymes , bilirubin level ; well result ultrasonography liver biliary tract . 2 . All data generate ERCP record , particularly relate procedure-related risk factor develop acute pancreatitis . In addition , nonpancreas-related complication record perforation bleeding . 3 . Any adverse event relate rectally apply indomethacin glycerin suppository record expulsion , irritation , bleed . Post-ERCP pancreatitis consider main outcome variable define development new increase abdominal pain consistent pancreatitis , elevate blood amylase lipase &gt; 3 time upper limit normal 24 h procedure , hospitalization ( prolongation exist hospitalization ) least 2 night . The severity determine accord consensus guideline , mild post-ERCP pancreatitis result hospitalization le 3 day , moderate post-ERCP pancreatitis result hospitalization 4-10 day . Severe post-ERCP pancreatitis qualify result hospitalization &gt; 10 day , lead development pancreatic necrosis pseudocysts , require percutaneous surgical intervention . Patients acute pancreatitis follow 30 day hospital discharge . Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia define amylase level least three time normal serum level absence abdominal pain . Follow The patient keep surveillance endoscopy recovery area 3 h ERCP . Measurement serum amylase determine 2 h post-ERCP include patient . Asymptomatic outpatient discharge 6 h surveillance monitoring sign symptom acute post-ERCP pancreatitis telephone contact 24 hour . Hospitalized asymptomatic patient discharge assign bed 4 hour surveillance , clinical surveillance continue 24 h. If new abdominal pain suggestive pancreatic origin appeares time , 2-h amylase level check confirmed serum lipase determination . All routine laboratory examination perform acute pancreatitis etiology establish . All patient diagnose post-ERCP pancreatitis manage medical care Department Gastroenterology . Patients submit computed tomography scan determine severity episode pancreatitis . Severity establish accord Cotton 's criterion . Statistical analysis Statistical software , SPSS IBM ( version 20 Windows ; IBM Corp. , Armonk , NY , USA ) beign use data analysis . The data obtain expressed frequency percentage , mean standard deviation . For compare result , Student 's test use continuous variable Chi2 Fisher 's exact test use qualitative data appropriate . Relative risk ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) determine well absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) , relative risk reduction ( RRR ) , number need treat ( NNT ) . Statistical significance two-tailed test assume p &lt; 0.05</detailed_description>
