	<brief_summary>Heart attack commonly cause rupture fatty deposit ( plaque ) within wall heart blood vessel . It appear process also frequently occur without cause symptom event likely explain development narrowing within heart artery subsequently produce symptom angina ( chest pain ) . Previous research show specialised scanner know PET ( positron emission tomography ) scan identify recently rupture plaque patient without symptom heart attack patient change blood test ( troponin ) suggest high risk heart attack future . This study aim identify patient use PET scan see marker increase heart attack risk reduce use blood thin medication ( ticagrelor ) already well recognised treatment people suffer recent heart attack .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DIAMOND - Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Reduce Myocardial Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator aim recruit patient multivessel , clinically stable coronary artery disease . Patients undergo baseline investigation include CT-PET image use 18F-Sodium Fluoride ( 18F-F ) tracer detect potentially unstable coronary plaque . The group separate without 18F-F uptake . Each group randomise receive oral ticagrelor match placebo addition usual medication . Patients remain aspirin eligible trial take additional antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment . The treatment continue 1 year .</detailed_description>
