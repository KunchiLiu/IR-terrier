	<brief_summary>This research do learn pancreatic cyst . The test currently available imperfect determine exactly type pancreatic cyst person , cyst contain cancer , risk develop cancer future . The aim study use combination clinical , image , cyst fluid analysis , molecular marker try help develop good tool answer question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Incidental pancreatic cyst increasingly recognize due widespread use cross-sectional imaging technique CT MRI . A number lesion pancreas form cyst , include serous cystadenomas ( SCA ) , mucinous cystic neoplasm ( MCNs ) , intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ( IPMNs ) , solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm ( SPNs ) , pseudocysts . SCAs pseudocysts consider benign ; whereas SPNs consider malignant require surgical resection . IPMNs MCNs consider neoplasms malignant potential , although exact risk malignant progression cyst unknown . Currently , MCN surgically resect , whereas IPMN resect feature suspicious malignancy . However , current diagnostic test always reliably distinguish harmless potentially harmful cyst . Recent study conduct Johns Hopkins show cyst type unique genetic feature could use diagnostic biomarkers . In study , clinical , image data cyst fluid analysis individual pancreatic cyst collect . In patient undergo endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) procedure , fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) perform , extra cyst fluid leave standard clinical test send , extra cyst fluid submit molecular marker analysis . If individual undergoes surgery remove cyst , cyst fluid collect cyst remove . In addition , small amount blood collect time EUS surgical procedure . AIMS : The general aim propose prospectively validate diagnostic approach model prediction mucinous versus non-mucinous , malignant versus non-malignant , pancreatic cyst use combination clinical , radiologic , biomarker characteristic .</detailed_description>
