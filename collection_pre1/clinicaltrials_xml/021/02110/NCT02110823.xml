	<brief_summary>The Single Ventricle Reconstruction ( SVR ) Trial look infant single ventricle heart defect first stage surgery ( Norwood operation ) . Infants enrol trial get one two kind shunt Norwood ; modify Blalock-Taussig shunt ( MBTS ) right ventricle pulmonary artery shunt ( RV-to-PA shunt ) . The purpose study learn child ( 2-6 year age ) enrol SVR Trial good one two shunt ( MBTS RV-to-PA ) year surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Ventricle Reconstruction Extension Study ( SVR II ) - Pediatric Heart Network</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among critical congenital heart lesion , hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) relate single right ventricle ( RV ) anomaly associate high morbidity mortality . The first stage palliation patient defect Norwood procedure . The essential component Norwood procedure include ( 1 ) atrial septectomy , ( 2 ) anastomosis proximal pulmonary artery aorta homograft augmentation aortic arch , ( 3 ) establishment source pulmonary blood flow , either modify Blalock-Taussig shunt ( MBTS ) right ventricle pulmonary artery ( RV-to-PA ) shunt . In May 2005 , Pediatric Heart Network begin multi-center , randomized trial , Single Ventricle Reconstruction ( SVR ) Trial , compare outcome subject HLHS single RV anomaly palliate use Norwood procedure either MBTS RV-to-PA shunt . The primary outcome trial freedom death cardiac transplantation 12 month post-randomization . The Single Ventricle Reconstruction Extension ( SVR II ) Study extension SVR Trial compare clinical outcome RV performance follow RV-to-PA shunt versus MBTS modification Norwood procedure subject 6 year post-randomization . Data collect annually age 2 6 year , well Fontan surgery . Vital status medical history ascertain annually last enrol subject 6 year old . Data obtain medical record review , phone interview parent guardian , electrocardiography ( ECG ) , core laboratory analysis echocardiographic image Holter monitor , completion questionnaire regard neurodevelopmental outcome , behavior , health-related quality life , family functioning . The primary outcome variable SVR II freedom death cardiac transplantation 6 year post-randomization . All subject randomize SVR trial include analysis endpoint .</detailed_description>
