	<brief_title>Eurartesim® Patients With Imported Uncomplicated Plasmodium Vivax Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vivax malaria occur throughout tropical , subtropical temperate latitude globally . During primary infection P. vivax parasites become dormant liver ( hypnozoites ) large period time might subsequently cause multiple blood-stage relapse . The asexual stage P. vivax generally still sensitive chloroquine ( CQ ) throughout world exception Indonesia Papua New Guinea high therapeutic failure rate range 5-84 % report . Also , report chloroquine failure country region specie endemic ; particular , presence CQ-resistant vivax strain well describe several country , include India , Brazil , Peru Colombia . The treatment dormant stage prevention relapse reach throughout 8-aminoquinolines ( primaquine commercially available indication ) . The current treatment recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) radical cure CQ-resistant vivax malaria Artemisinin base Combination Therapies ( ACTs ) partner drug long half-life , combine two week regiment primaquine ( WHO , 2010 ) . Among variety suitable artemisinin-based combination , fix combination dihydroartemisinin ( DHA ) piperaquine ( PQP ) consider excellent therapeutic approach since get requirement consider essential show positive benefit/risk ratio malaria therapy . Sigma-Tau i.f.r . S.p.A. develop DHA+PQP formulation ( Eurartesim® ) manufacture accord international Good Manufacturing Practice ( GMP ) standard recently receive marketing authorization Europe via centralized procedure European Medicine Agency ( EMA ) uncomplicated episode P. falciparum malaria . A substantial amount data collect patient uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria treat DHA+PQP combination . In addition , several study provide evidence high cure rate patient P. vivax malaria treat DHA+PQP , however , data available far efficacy safety DHA+PQP treatment patient import P. vivax malaria . Acquiring data therefore particular importance since malaria represent important burden among travel-acquired illness consider number case ( 10-20 % import malaria case due P. vivax infection ) also potential fatal outcome . The aim present study investigate efficacy , safety tolerability therapeutic course Eurartesim® traveller contract malaria due infection P. vivax endemic country . The result `` proof concept '' study use estimating failure rate precise way dimension one subsequent phase III trial comparative efficacy .</detailed_description>
