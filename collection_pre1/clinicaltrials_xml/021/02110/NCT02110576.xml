	<brief_title>Procedure For The Reference Range Study For Absolute MA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part examination LY30 calculate , investigator would like explore difference Maximum Amplitude ( MA ) LY30 calculate traditional small deviation method absolute MA method . The maximum amplitude ( MA ) sample determine real-time use one two MA-identifying algorithm : Small Deviation MA ( default algorithm ) Absolute MA . Both algorithms available commercially available software . Both algorithms find MA sample ; however , difference two algorithm `` acceptance criterion '' use identify MA . As compare Small Deviation MA , Absolute MA large stringent rule set . A study run establish reference interval follow guideline set CLSI document C28-A3c . This guideline call reference interval construct least 120 donor . To meet guidance outline CLSI guideline , collect minimum 146 donor .</detailed_description>
