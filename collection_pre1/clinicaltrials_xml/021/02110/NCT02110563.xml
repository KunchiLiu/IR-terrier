	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety tolerability investigational anticancer drug DCR-MYC . DCR-MYC novel synthetic double-stranded RNA stable lipid particle suspension target oncogene MYC . MYC oncogene activation important growth many hematologic solid tumor malignancy . In study Sponsor propose study DCR-MYC ability inhibit MYC thereby inhibit cancer cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I , Multicenter , Dose Escalation Study DCR-MYC Patients With Solid Tumors , Multiple Myeloma , Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first-in human study , DCR-MYC administer 2 hour intravenous ( IV ) infusion , weekly 2 week follow rest week ( 3 week = 1 cycle ) , patient either solid tumor malignancy , multiple myeloma , non-Hodgkins lymphoma respond previous treatment . The high safe dose DCR-MYC administer identify . In addition , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile , potential pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect , well antitumor activity DCR-MYC evaluate . There 2 expansion cohort maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ( high safe dose identify study may lower ) : - Biopsy Cohort : 6 patient , tumor biopsy perform pre-dosing Cycle 2/Day 11 ; assessment dose escalation cohort - PNET Cohort : Up 20 patient pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ; assessment dose escalation cohort , however few PD ( cytokine ) assessments PK assessment</detailed_description>
