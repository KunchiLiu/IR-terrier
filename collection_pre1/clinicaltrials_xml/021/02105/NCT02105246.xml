	<brief_summary>The long-term goal research improve patient-centered outcome patient coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . CHD lead cause death world . Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) program decrease mortality improve quality life patient CHD . Published guideline recommend exercise-based CR follow hospitalization myocardial infarction , coronary artery bypass grafting , percutaneous coronary revascularization , referral CR one nine performance measure establish American Heart Association American College Cardiology patient CHD . Despite compel benefit , CR program vastly underutilized , less third eligible patient participate . The large barrier patient participation CR must provide physician 's office hospital set qualify reimbursement . For reason , virtually exist CR program require patient travel CR center 3 time per week 12 36 week . Unfortunately , many Americans live far CR center enroll , even nearby program available , many patient time , flexibility , transportation , social support , and/or financial resource attend . One promising solution problem CR under-utilization great implementation home-based CR . Both home center-based CR program equal benefit cardiovascular risk factor quality life . However , similar efficacy necessarily translate similar effectiveness . If patient likely participate home- vs. center-based therapy , great participation could lead great clinical effectiveness . We therefore conduct quasi-experimental , control trial two VA medical center determine comparative effectiveness referral home- vs. center-based CR patient CHD . Aim 1 : Determine whether automatic referral home- vs. center-based CR increase patient participation CR hospitalization myocardial infarction coronary revascularization . Aim 2 : Among patient choose participate CR , compare effectiveness home- vs. centerbased CR six-minute walk distance , quality life , healthcare expenditure . Aim 3 : Determine whether effect home vs. center-based CR differ age , gender , race , ethnicity , employment , socioeconomic status , social support , comorbid condition , patient preference . Results study ( ) help policy maker determine effect cover home CR healthcare expenditures patient CHD ; ( b ) help provider understand potential benefit harm home- vs. center-based CR ; ( c ) help patient answer question like , `` Given personal circumstance preference , option improve outcomes important .</brief_summary>
