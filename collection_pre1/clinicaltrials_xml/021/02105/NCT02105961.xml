	<criteria>COPD diagnosis : Subjects clinically document history COPD least 1 year accordance follow definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Severity COPD : Subjects must present follow : measure pre postsalbutamol Forced expiratory volume one second/ Forced vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 Visit 1 confirm diagnosis COPD ; measure postsalbutamol FEV1 &gt; 20 percent &lt; =80 percent predict normal value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III reference equation Visit 1 History exacerbation : A well documented history ( e.g. , medical record verification ) 12 month prior Visit 1 ; least two moderate COPD exacerbation . Moderate define use systemic corticosteroid ( intramuscular ( IM ) , intravenous , oral ) and/or treatment antibiotic ; least one severe COPD exacerbation . Severe define require hospitalization . Note : At least one exacerbation must occur subject take Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) plus long acting beta2agonist ( LABA ) plus long acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) . Prior use antibiotic alone qualify moderate exacerbation unless use specifically treatment worsen symptom COPD . Concomitant COPD therapy : A well documented requirement optimize standard care background therapy include Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) plus 2 additional COPD medication ( i.e. , triple therapy ) 12 month prior Visit 1 meet follow criterion : Immediately prior Visit 1 , minimum 3 month use ; Inhaled corticosteroid dose &gt; = 500 microgram ( mcg ) /day fluticasone propionate dose equivalent plus ; LABA LAMA . For subject continually maintain ICS plus LABA plus LAMA entire 12 month prior Visit 1 use follow allow ( 3 month immediately prior Visit 1 ) ; inhale corticosteroid dose &gt; =500 mcg/day fluticasone propionate dose equivalent plus ; LABA LAMA ; use least one class COPD medication ( i.e. , phosphodiesterase4inhibitors , methylxanthines , combination short act beta2agonist short act muscarinic antagonist ) . Informed Consent : Able give write informed consent prior participation study , include ability comply requirement restriction list consent form . Subjects must able read , comprehend , write level sufficient complete study related material .

French subject : In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Subjects Asthma : Current Former Smokers : Subjects current diagnosis asthma ( prior history eligible meet inclusion criterion current diagnosis COPD ) ; NeverSmokers : Subjects history asthma . Other respiratory disorder : The investigator must judge COPD primary diagnosis accounting clinical manifestation lung disease . Subjects alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD exclude . Also , exclude subject active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , primary pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Subjects also exclude maintenance use bilevel positive airway pressure require treatment respiratory disorder .

Pulmonary rehabilitation program : Participation acute phase pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Subjects maintenance phase pulmonary rehabilitation program exclude . Oxygen : Subjects receive treatment oxygen 4.0 liters/minute ( L/min ) . While breathe supplemental oxygen , subject demonstrate oxyhemoglobin saturation great equal 89 percent . 12lead Electrocardiography ( ECG ) finding : An abnormal significant ECG find 12lead ECG conduct Visit 1 , consider clinically significant Investigator . 12lead ECGs overread centralize independent cardiologist assist consistent evaluation subject eligibility . Results 12lead ECG overread must receive prior assess eligibility Visit 2 . Unstable life threaten cardiac disease : Subjects follow would exclude : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month ; Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month ; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV Heart failure Other diseases/abnormalities : Subjects ( historical ) current evidence clinically significant , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Eosinophilic disease : Subjects condition could lead elevate eosinophils Hypereosinophilic syndromes include Eosinophilic Granulomatosis Polyangiitis ( EGPA , also know ChurgStrauss Syndrome ) , Eosinophilic Esophagitis .
