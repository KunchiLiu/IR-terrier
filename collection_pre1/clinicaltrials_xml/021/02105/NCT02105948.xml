	<brief_summary>This multi-center , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel group trial evaluate mepolizumab 100 mg placebo give every 4 week subcutaneous ( SC ) injection . In severe COPD patient , sputum eosinophil level elevate similar see severe asthmatic . It hypothesize reduction eosinophil mepolizumab COPD patient would translate reduction COPD exacerbation . The study determine reduction exacerbation subject baseline blood eosinophil count least 150 cells/microlitres . The study evaluate efficacy safety mepolizumab frequency moderate severe exacerbation COPD subject high risk exacerbation , despite use optimize standard care background therapy . Overall study , total 800 subject randomise 1:1 ratio receive placebo mepolizumab ( 100 milligram ( mg ) ) administer SC . The total duration study approximately 62 week , consist 1 2 week screening period , 52-week treatment period 8-week follow-up period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>COPD diagnosis : Subjects clinically document history COPD least 1 year accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society . Severity COPD : Subjects must present follow : measure pre postsalbutamol Forced expiratory volume one second/ Forced vital capacity ( FEV1/FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 Visit 1 confirm diagnosis COPD ; measure postsalbutamol FEV1 &gt; 20 percent &lt; =80 percent predict normal value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III reference equation Visit 1 . History exacerbation : A well documented history ( like medical record verification ) 12 month prior Visit 1 : least two moderate COPD exacerbation . Moderate define use systemic corticosteroid ( IM , intravenous , oral ) and/or treatment antibiotic , least one severe COPD exacerbation . Severe define require hospitalization . Note : At least one exacerbation must occur subject take Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) plus long acting beta2agonist ( LABA ) plus long acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) . Note : Prior use antibiotic alone qualify moderate exacerbation unless use specifically treatment worsen symptom COPD . Concomitant COPD therapy : A well documented requirement optimize standard care ( SoC ) background therapy include ICS plus 2 additional COPD medication ( i.e. , triple therapy ) 12 month prior Visit 1 meet follow criterion : Immediately prior Visit 1 , minimum 3 month use inhale corticosteroid ( dose &gt; =500 microgram ( mcg ) /day fluticasone propionate dose equivalent plus ) ; LABA LAMA . For subject continually maintain ICS plus LABA plus LAMA entire 12 month prior Visit 1 use follow allow ( 3 month immediately prior Visit 1 ) : inhale corticosteroid dose &gt; =500 mcg/day fluticasone propionate dose equivalent plus ; LABA LAMA use least one class COPD medication suggest 2013 Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline patient prone exacerbation ( i.e. , phosphodiesterase4inhibitors , methylxanthines , combination short act beta2agonist short act muscarinic antagonist ) . Note : Subjects must willing stay SoC COPD medication duration study . Informed Consent : Able give write informed consent prior participation study , include ability comply requirement restriction list consent form . Subjects must able read , comprehend , write level sufficient complete study related material . Gender : Male Eligible Female ; To eligible entry study female child bear potential must commit consistent correct use acceptable method birth control time consent , duration trial , 4 month last study drug administration . Age : At least 40 year age Visit 1 . Smoking status : Subject confirm COPD eligible participate independent smoking status smoke history , i.e . current smoker , never smokers exsmokers enrol study ; Current smoker define history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears [ number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ) ] ; Former smoker define meet definition current smoker stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 ; Never smoker meet definition current former smoker . French subject : In France , subject eligible inclusion study either affiliate beneficiary social security category . Subjects Asthma : Current Former Smokers : Subjects current diagnosis asthma ( prior history eligible meet inclusion criterion current diagnosis COPD ) ; NeverSmokers : Subjects history asthma ; Other respiratory disorder : The investigator must judge COPD primary diagnosis accounting clinical manifestation lung disease . Subjects alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD exclude . Also , exclude subject active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , primary pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease active pulmonary disease . Subjects also exclude maintenance use bilevel positive airway pressure require treatment respiratory disorder . COPD stability : Subjects pneumonia , exacerbation , low respiratory infection within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Lung resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Visit 1 . Pulmonary rehabilitation program : Participation acute phase pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Subjects maintenance phase pulmonary rehabilitation program exclude . Oxygen : Subjects receive treatment oxygen 4.0 Litres/minute ( L/min ) . While breathe supplemental oxygen , subject demonstrate oxyhemoglobin saturation great equal 89 percent . 12lead Electrocardiography ( ECG ) finding : An abnormal significant ECG find 12lead ECG conduct Visit 1 consider clinically significant Investigator . 12lead ECGs overread centralize independent cardiologist assist consistent evaluation subject eligibility . Results 12lead ECG overread must receive prior assess eligibility Visit 2 . Unstable life threaten cardiac disease : Subjects follow would exclude : Myocardial infarction unstable angina last 6 month ; Unstable life threaten cardiac arrhythmia require intervention last 3 month ; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class IV Heart failure . Other diseases/abnormalities : Subjects ( historical ) current evidence clinically significant , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) haematological abnormality uncontrolled . Significant define disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study . Eosinophilic disease : Subjects condition could lead elevate eosinophils Hypereosinophilic syndromes include Eosinophilic Granulomatosis Polyangiitis ( EGPA , also know ChurgStrauss Syndrome ) , Eosinophilic Esophagitis .

Affiliation Investigator Site : Is investigator , subinvestigator , study coordinator , employee participate investigator study site , immediate family member aforementioned involve study . Randomization Criteria In order randomize study drug subject must meet follow randomization criterion Visit 2 : Blood eosinophil : While threshold enrolment , information eosinophil level obtain prior randomization . Electronic Diary Compliance : Compliance completion eDiary define completion question 5 day 7 day immediately precede Visit 2 . 12lead ECG : No evidence abnormal significant ECG find 12 lead ECG conduct Visit 1 indicate overread provide centralized independent cardiologist . Subjects QT interval correct Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &gt; =450 msec eligible . For subject QRS interval &gt; =120 msec , QTcF &gt; =480 msec eligible . Specific ECG finding preclude subject eligibility list protocol . Abnormal chest Xray ( Computerized Tomography [ CT scan ] ) : No chest Xray ( CT scan ) reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . If chest Xray CT scan available within 6 month prior Visit 1 , chest Xray must take Visit 1 result review prior randomization . For site Germany : If chest Xray ( CT scan ) within 6 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) available , subject eligible study . Laboratory abnormality : No evidence clinically significant abnormality haematological , biochemical , urinalysis screen Visit 1 , judge investigator . Hepatitis B : Subjects HBsAg positive HBcAb positive must HBV DNA level &gt; = 2000 IU/ml . Liver function test : Subjects must meet follow base result sample take Visit 1 : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2x ULN ( upper limit normal ) ; Alkaline Phosphatase ( Alk Phos ) &lt; =2x ULN ; Bilirubin &lt; =1.5x ULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 percent )</criteria>
