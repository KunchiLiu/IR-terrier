	<brief_summary>The current project randomize , control evaluation new weight loss health promotion intervention truck driver . The intervention 6-month weight loss competition support computer base training , behavioral self-monitoring , motivational interviewing . We hypothesize intervention produce great change usual practice control condition . Our secondary hypothesis social support stress home work environment moderate intervention efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Commercial truck driver overweight obesity rate may 20 % high general population . Obesity establish mortality disease consequence , include heart disease , diabetes , sleep apnea . Driver health also important safety hazard obesity sleep apnea increase risk crash . Drivers experience multiple roadblock health , include isolate job structure restrict physical activity dietary choice . Despite grow health crisis , lack effective weight loss health promotion intervention truck driver . We therefore developed intervention integrate job structure modern technology truck driving . The intervention 6-month weight loss competition support computer base training , behavioral self-monitoring , motivational interviewing . The study cluster randomize trial worksites ( terminal ) randomize intervention control condition . We collect measure driver baseline ( month 0 ) , post-intervention ( month 6 ) , one-year follow-up ( month 18 ) . The project take place five year accomplish three specific aim : 1 . Determine intervention efficacy produce change diet , exercise , body weight . Previous weight loss intervention truck driver minimally effective , need evaluate new approach randomize , control design . Therefore , randomize match pair worksites ( terminal ) intervention control condition . Drivers intervention terminal complete intervention activity 6-month period . Drivers control terminal receive treatment time period . Primary outcome change body weight , fruit vegetable consumption , high-saturated fat high-sugar food consumption , physical activity . 2 . Determine whether baseline social support stress moderate intervention efficacy . Although social support stress establish effect weight loss population , know little role social support stress intervention truck driver . Therefore , measure social support stress home work environment measurement time point . After intervention , one-year follow-up , test whether social support stress factor moderate subsequent behavior change weight loss . 3 . Measure integrity intervention component model intervention work . We evaluate new multi-component intervention understudied population . In order understand intervention work guide future research , measure fidelity participation intervention component use mediation analyse determine different component affect study outcome . Analyses provide explicit check intervention 's theoretical underpinnings ass whether proposed change process achieve . Accomplishing aim significantly advance weight loss health promotion knowledge benefit 3 million truck driver US , potentially generalize 15 million additional worker spend substantial time alone travel work .</detailed_description>
