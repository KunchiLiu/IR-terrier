	<brief_title>The Effect Identification Badge Situation Awareness During High Fidelity Simulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-fidelity simulation well recognize educational tool . Mr. Issenberg complete review ( 2005 ) determine feature high-fidelity simulation train lead effective learning . It review , mention validity simulator ( realism ) essential help learner increase skill sharpen response . It essential get maintain engagement high-fidelity simulation pas increase realism situation awareness . The purpose study evaluate use identification badge ( physical conceptual realism ) high-fidelity simulation impact situation awareness engagement .</detailed_description>
