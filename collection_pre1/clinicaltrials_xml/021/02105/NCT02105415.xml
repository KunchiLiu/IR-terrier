	<brief_title>Ketamine / Propofol Admixture `` Ketofol '' Induction Critically Ill Against Etomidate : KEEP PACE Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endotracheal intubation procedure may cause significant hemodynamic perturbation severely impact outcome critically ill. To ensure safe outcome particular procedure , many factor clinician face . One decision confront critical care physician involve correct combination medication facilitate safe outcome . Given report hemodynamic stability , etomidate medication choose many provider particular situation . However , association possible increase mortality make less ideal number critical care physician . In recent year , admixture propofol ketamine study demonstrate hemodynamic stability base balance hemodynamic effect two individual agent alone . This novel medication combination , sometimes refer `` ketofol '' , may offer valuable alternative critical care physician . Therefore , randomize parallel-group clinical trial adult critically ill patient admit medical ( MB-6B/G ) and/or surgical intensive care unit ( MB-7D/E ) Mayo Clinic Rochester meet criterion designate urgent and/or emergent intubation need receive one two intervention base stratified randomization . The `` active '' intervention arm receive ketamine/propofol ( ketofol ) facilitate endotracheal intubation . The comparison arm receive etomidate . The primary outcome focus hemodynamic data record first 15 minute post-administration secondary outcome address intensive care unit length stay , mortality , adrenal function , vasoactive medication use , among others .</detailed_description>
