	<brief_title>Optimizing Cognitive Remediation Outcomes Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study explicitly aggressively drive optimal response neuroplasticity- base cognitive remediation schizophrenia order maximize treatment response . We investigate factor generally ignore computer-based cognitive remediation programs—those relate social cognition -- delineate relationship motivation , functional outcome , neural substrate reward anticipation emotion processing . Current research indicate , unless fully understand harness factor , achieve meaningful treatment gain individual schizophrenia . Our specific aim : 1 . To perform RCT 100 schizophrenia subject assign either 60 hour neuroplasticity- base computerize targeted cognitive training ( TCT ) focus exclusively `` cold cognition '' ( program train early sensory processing , attention , work memory cognitive control auditory visual domain ) , 60 hour train combine TCT program 20 minute per day adaptive computerize social cognition training ( SCT ) exercise . 2 . To compare outcomes two group subject measure neurocognition , social cognition , motivation , functional outcome . 3 . To assess subject six month intervention determine durability training effect . 4 . To identify change brain activation pattern key neural region result TCT alone vs. TCT+SCT : reward anticipation , emotion recognition . The timeliness approach support recent evidence demonstrate weak association traditional cognitive remediation approach functional outcome schizophrenia , strong , direct relationship social cognition functional outcome . Thus must examine clinical , functional , neural effect well-designed state-of-the-art cognitive training program combine neurocognition social cognition training .</detailed_description>
