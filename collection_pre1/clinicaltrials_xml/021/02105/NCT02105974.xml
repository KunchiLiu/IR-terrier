Female subject must postmenopausal use highly effective method avoidance pregnancy . The decision include exclude woman childbearing potential may make discretion investigator accordance local practice relation adequate contraception . Age : &gt; =40 year age Screening ( Visit 1 ) COPD diagnosis : Subjects clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society : COPD preventable treatable disease characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also associate significant systemic consequence . Severity disease : Subjects measure postalbuterol ( salbutamol ) FEV1/ Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; =0.70 FEV1 &gt; =30 &lt; =70 percent predict normal value use Global Lung Function Initiative 2012 reference equation Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Tobacco use : Subjects current prior history &gt; =10 packyears cigarette smoke Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . History COPD exacerbation : A documented history ( e.g. , medical record verification ) least one COPD exacerbation 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) require either systemic/oral corticosteroid , antibiotic and/or hospitalization . Current symptoms COPD : A Subject Diary combine symptom score ( combination breathlessness , cough , sputum , night time awakening require treatment albuterol [ salbutamol ] ) &gt; =4 least 5 7 day immediately precede Visit 2 ( Randomization ) QTc Criteria : QTc &lt; 450 msec QTc &lt; 480 msec patient bundle branch block . Pregnancy : Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study . Asthma : Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( Subjects prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD ) . Other respiratory disorder : Subjects alpha1antitrypsin deficiency underlie cause COPD underlying cause COPD , active tuberculosis , lung cancer , bronchiectasis ( Note : focal bronchiectasis exclusionary ) , sarcoidosis , pulmonary fibrosis ( Note : focal fibrotic pulmonary lesion exclusionary ) , primary pulmonary hypertension , interstitial lung disease , active pulmonary disease . Lung resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Chest Xray ( compute tomography [ CT ] scan ) : Subjects chest Xray ( CT scan ) reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality believe due presence COPD . A chest Xray must take Screening ( Visit 1 ) chest Xray CT scan available within 1 year prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . Hospitalization : Subjects hospitalize due poorly control COPD resolve least 4 week prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) least 6 week follow last dose systemic corticosteroid . Poorly control COPD : Subjects poorly control COPD , define occurrence follow 6 week prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) : Acute worsen COPD manage subject systemic corticosteroid antibiotic require treatment prescribed physician . Lower respiratory tract infection : Subjects low respiratory tract infection require use antibiotic within 6 week prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . COPD exacerbation/lower respiratory tract infection RunIn Period : Subjects experience moderate/severe COPD exacerbation ( As per definition `` COPD Exacerbations Pneumonia '' protocol ) and/or low respiratory tract infection ( include pneumonia ) RunIn Period . Abnormal , clinically significant laboratory finding : Subjects abnormal clinical significant find liver chemistry test Screening ( Visit 1 ) upon repeat prior randomization . Abnormal , clinically significant 12lead ECG Screening ( Visit 1 ) : Subjects abnormal , clinically significant 12Lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) find Screening ( Visit 1 ) upon repeat prior randomization . Other diseases/abnormalities : Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant unstable disease cardiovascular ( e.g. , patient require implantable cardioverterdefibrillators ( ICD ) , pacemaker require rate set &gt; 60 beat per minute ( bpm ) , uncontrolled hypertension , New Your Heart Association Class IV , know leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 30 percent ) neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) , peptic ulcer disease , hematological abnormality . Liver disease : Subjects unstable liver disease ( define presence ascites , encephalopathy , coagulopathy , hypoalbuminaemia , oesophageal gastric varix persistent jaundice ) , cirrhosis , know biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Note : Subjects chronic stable hepatitis B C eligible subject otherwise meet entry criterion ( e.g. , presence hepatitis B surface antigen positive hepatitis C test result within 3 month screen ) . However , subject chronic stable hepatitis B exclude significant immunosuppressive cytotoxic agent administer , due risk hepatitis B reactivation , unless hepatitis B antiviral administer outlined Chronic Hepatitis B American Association Study Liver Diseases ' ( AASLD ) Practice Guidelines . Cancer : Subjects carcinoma complete remission least 5 year . Carcinoma situ cervix , squamous cell carcinoma basal cell carcinoma skin would exclude subject consider cure within 5 year since diagnosis . Contraindications : Subjects history allergy hypersensitivity study medication ( e.g . betaagonists , corticosteroid ) component inhalation powder ( e.g. , lactose , magnesium stearate ) . In addition , subject history severe milk protein allergy , opinion investigator , contraindicate subject 's participation also exclude . Drug/alcohol abuse : Subjects know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within last 2 year Medication prior spirometry : Subjects medically unable withhold albuterol ( salbutamol ) ipratropium bromide 4hour period require prior spirometry test study visit . Additional medication : Use certain medication bronchodilator corticosteroid protocolspecific time prior Visit 1 ( Investigator discuss specific medication ) '' Oxygen therapy : Subjects receive treatment longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) nocturnal oxygen therapy require great 12 hour day . Oxygen need ( prn ) use ( i.e. , &lt; =12 hour per day ) exclusionary . Sleep apnea : Subjects clinically significant sleep apnea require use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) . Pulmonary rehabilitation : Subjects participate acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program within 4 week prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) enter acute phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program study . Subjects maintenance phase Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program exclude . NonCompliance RunIn Period : Failure demonstrate adequate compliance define completion Diary Card ( complete diary entry least 5 last 7 consecutive day ) , ability withhold antiCOPD medication keep clinic visit appointment . In addition , subject must record RunIn study medication use least 5 last 7 , consecutive day RunIn period continue study . Potential noncompliance : Subjects risk noncompliance , unable comply study procedure . Any infirmity , disability , geographic location would limit compliance schedule visit . Questionable validity consent : Subjects history psychiatric disease , intellectual deficiency , poor motivation condition limit validity inform consent participate study .
