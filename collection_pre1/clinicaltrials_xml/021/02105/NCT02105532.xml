	<detailed_description>Trial overview : TRIGGER pragmatic trial aim recruit adult patient admit cause AUGIB ( non-variceal variceal ) . The study take place six United Kingdon hospital randomly allocate transfusion policy cluster level ; three site allocate restrictive transfusion policy three liberal transfusion policy . Given challenge involve early recruitment cross-speciality care , feasibility study essential determine whether sufficient proportion eligible patient recruit trial clinician adhere allocate transfusion policy . Recruitment operate 6 month total . The investigator compare recruitment rate , protocol adherence , clinical characteristic patient recruit , exposure RBC transfusion difference Hb concentration restrictive liberal transfusion policy . The investigator collect important clinical outcome investigator anticipate central phase III trial , include 28-day mortality , bleed rate serious adverse event restrictive liberal transfusion policy . The investigator also collect data enable u plan health economic evaluation quality life assessment phase III trial .</detailed_description>
