	<brief_summary>This GWAS pilot study aim identify possible candidate gene associate obesity explore single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) small group obese , metabolically healthy white adult , match lean , white adult , metabolically healthy . The investigator hypothesize careful phenotyping subject sand match increase power find SNP significantly associate obesity ( defined BMI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GWAS Small Group Metabolically Healthy Obese White Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Between 60 % -70 % risk obesity appear heritable . Unfortunately , exact gene involve difficult identify . New technology exist help researcher discover obesity susceptibility gene . One technology Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) Array 6.0 chip . SNPs individual base pair difference gene different individual , main source human genetic diversity . The `` chip '' thumbnail-size silicon surface contain copy hundred thousand SNPs human genome ( case around 900,000 ) . SNP chip allow researcher screen thousand gene single experiment compare gene subject particular disease condition unaffected control subject . The investigator study utilizes SNP chip compare genetic profile obese subject ( N = 20 , body mass index &gt; 35 kg/m2 ) without common obesity-related co-morbidities diabetes mellitus hypertension well match , lean control ( N = 20 , body mass index 18-25 kg/m2 ) . This pilot study intend explore follow : 1 ) possible association obesity previously unidentified obesity susceptibility gene ; 2 ) association know obesity gene obesity risk subject without obesity-related metabolic co-morbidities ; 3 ) well genetic data conform study similar population way assess investigator identify representative cohort obese subject .</detailed_description>
