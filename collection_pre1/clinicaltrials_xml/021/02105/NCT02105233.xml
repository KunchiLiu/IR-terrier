	<brief_summary>Prognosis patient glioblastomas ( aggressive high-grade glioma ) remain unfavourable . Tools improve brain tumor surgery , particular glioma , increase . There seem agreement achieve extensive resection , do safely without jeopardize neurological function , improve survival . Ultrasound currently use tool provide 2D 3D image purpose tumor localization resection control . For use resection control resection cavity fill saline provide acoustic coupling ultrasound transducer tissue . However , attenuation acoustic wave low saline compare brain difference attenuation cause artifact may severely degrade ultrasound image . Such artifact see high-intensity signal resection cavity wall beyond , potentially mask small tumor remnant generally make interpretation image difficult . This research group develop acoustic fluid intend use resection cavity instead saline . Tests laboratory measurement show fluid reduces artifacts potential enhance ultrasound image quality brain tumor surgery . The investigator expect acoustic fluid make easy detect small tumor remnant near end operation , thus increase success glioma surgery . The purpose study test fluid surgery histopathologically proven glioblastoma ass safety efficacy .</brief_summary>
