	<detailed_description>This Phase I study 3 part : Part A : Double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-escalating , single dose study healthy volunteer . Part B : Double blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-escalating , multiple dose study healthy volunteer . Part C : Open label , single dose , cross-over , preliminary food effect study healthy volunteer . Number subject : Part A : 80 healthy volunteer ( 10 cohort 8 subject ) Part B : About 40 healthy volunteer ( 5 cohort 8 subject ) In Part B , multiple dos 200 ( Cohort B1 ) , 300 ( Cohort B2 ) , 400 ( Cohort B3 ) , 500 mg ( Cohort B4 ) 8 subject enrol cohort . At dose 200mg , additional cohort ( Cohort B1a ) 8 subject need enrol base clinical data ( safety , tolerability , available PK data clinical laboratory value ) . The decision make jointly Principal Investigator sponsor . Within cohort , 6 subject receive HMPL-523 2 subject receive placebo Part C : 6 healthy volunteer ( 1 cohort ; receive HMPL-523 100 mg ) . Treatments : -Part A : Single Ascending Dose.Subjects receive single dose 800 mg HMPL-523 matching placebo Day 1 . The plan dose level : 5 , 20 , 50,100 , 200 , 300 mg fast condition , follow 300 , 400 , 600 , 800 mg feed condition standard meal , accord randomization schedule . Dose level may repeat , reduce administered split dose deem appropriate Principal Investigator Sponsor 's medical Expert . For Cohort 1 sentinel group ( 1 HMPL-523 1 placebo ) dose 5 mg HMPL-523 , 24 hour prior plan dose remain six subject . Dosing remain six base investigator judgment . The decision dose escalate make jointly Principal Investigator sponsor base clinical data ( safety , tolerability , available PK data clinical laboratory value ) . -Part B : Multiple Ascending Dose ( MAD ) . Part B study design assess effect multiple ascend dos HMPL-523 healthy volunteer . The total daily dos dose regimen Part B determine 200 , 300,400 500 mg base review safety PK data Part A , make jointly Principal Investigator sponsor . The dose le one already administer participant Part A . Because dog similar protein binding human , closely monitor clinical safety laboratory result AUC get 2085 h*ng/mL , NOAEL AUC dog . Further dose escalation base clinical safety discussion sponsor investigator . Part C : Preliminary Food Effect Study . Part C study design preliminarily assess effect food pharmacokinetics HMPL-523 healthy volunteer . Subjects first receive single dose HMPL-523 100mg fasted condition ( Period 1 ) follow washout period 7 day , receive single dose HMPL-523 100mg consume standard high fat breakfast ( fed condition ) ( Period 2 ) . Part C may conduct time , provide 100 mg deem safe Part A . Safety data : The follow safety evaluation perform study : Adverse event , physical examination , clinical safety laboratory ( hematology , clinical chemistry , urinalysis ) , body weight , oral temperature , triplicate blood pressure heart rate , ECG .</detailed_description>
