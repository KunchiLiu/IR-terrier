	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine clear barrier place eye effect goggle monitoring . When patient general anesthesia lose ability blink eye may dry . They may also lose ability keep eye fully close . The anesthesiologist take several step prevent injury eye . First eyes lubricate ointment eyelid hold closed position use clear barrier . During pituitary surgery routine practice perform many type monitor . One type monitoring stimulate eye light . This help surgeon protect nerve supply eye . The light supplied pair goggles place eye surgery . To help achieve objective , investigator ask patient undergo pituitary surgery give u permission record two set number form monitoring device prior application clear barrier second barrier apply . This do patient already asleep aware happen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tegaderm Visual Evoked Potentials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal injury frequent ocular complication general anesthesia patient ability blink keep eye completely close . Lagophthalmos define inability close eyelid completely . Blinking cover eye thin layer tear fluid , thereby promote moist environment necessary cell exterior part eye . The tear also flush foreign body wash away . This crucial maintain lubrication proper eye health . If process impair , lagophthalmos , eye suffer abrasion infection . Lagophthalmos lead corneal dry ulceration . Several strategy widely use try prevent corneal abrasion , although paucity recent study support one method another . If patient receive general anesthesia common practice lubricate eye tape close . One way prevent lagophthalmos use tegaderm . A tegaderm thin transparent barrier customarily use protect wound catheter site . The tegaderm several advantage include breathability conformity skin . In operating room place patient ' eyelid keep eye close prevent injury . During surgical removal pituitary adenoma , conduction anterior visual pathway monitor continuous record visual evoke potential ( VEP ) . The VEP test function visual pathway retina occipital cortex . It measure conduction visual pathway optic nerve , optic chiasm , optic radiation occipital cortex . This method perform application special goggles eye . These goggles place tegaderm noninvasive embed flash diode delivery visual stimulus . Changes occipital EEG ( record intraoperatively computer program neurophysiology technician ) observe stimulation light attempt localize structure possible damage structure primary visual pathway . This helpful neurosurgeon aim avoid compression injury optic nerve . These goggles use routinely year visual pathway monitor pituitary tumor resection . Nevertheless question application tegaderm affect VEP monitoring . By measure visual evoked potential tegaderm placement , hope determine change evoke potential data due placement tegaderm . On word , able identify tegaderm placement affect visual evoke potential data reliability . Experimental Plan : The investigator approach patient age 18 undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary tumor resection visual evoke potential monitoring.The plan include 40 patient University Hospital . If patient agreeable subject VEP measure routine tegaderm application . Visual evoke potential monitoring conduct routinely do neurophysiology technician . Data collect neurophysiologist report analyze latency amplitude tegaderm application . As matter routine , full monitoring report become component patient 's medical record .</detailed_description>
