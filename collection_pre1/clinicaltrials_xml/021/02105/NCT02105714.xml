	<brief_summary>NIDIAG international collaboration integrate diagnosis-treatment platform , fund European Commission ( EC ) . NIDIAG aim develop improved , patient-centred system deliver primary health care resource-constrained setting . NIDIAG investigate three clinical syndrome , namely ( ) persistent digestive disorder , ( ii ) persistent fever ( iii ) neurological disorder , due neglect tropical disease ( NTDs ) . The current study focus persistent digestive disorder , define diarrhoea abdominal pain last least 2 week . While acute diarrhoea study globally , research activity focus epidemiology , diagnosis treatment long-lasting diarrhoeal episode ( 2 week longer ) tropic . The spectrum possibly involve pathogen include 30 bacterial , parasitic viral infectious agent . This lack data may explain fact people suffer NTDs might seek care late stage disease . Furthermore , health system affect region often weak primary health-care centre often under-staffed lack essential diagnostic equipment . The hypothesis study development evidence-based syndromic approach lead well diagnosis management NTDs patient persistent digestive disorder . The study carry two West African country ( Côte d'Ivoire Mali ) two Asian country ( Indonesia Nepal ) . The study follow `` case-control '' design patient control prospectively enrol . In order address knowledge gap , three specific objective pursue . First , contribution NTDs 'persistent digestive disorder syndrome ' assess . Second , value clinical feature rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) diagnosis target NTDs give rise persistent digestive disorder determine . Third , clinical response standard empiric target treatment several NTDs patient persistent digestive disorder evaluate . These objective provide long-term benefit community improve clinical decision-making process target NTDs thus , good diagnostic work-up patient management achieve study country similar resource-constrained country</brief_summary>
