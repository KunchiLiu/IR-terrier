	<brief_summary>For patient present Emergency Department acute dyspnea , emergency physician ask categorize diagnosis acute decompensated heart failure non-cardiogenic shortness breath ) initial clinical assessment , b ) performing lung ultrasound ( LUS ) LUS arm chest radiography ( CXR ) natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro BNP ) result CXR arm . All patient undergo CXR , enrol LUS arm , sonographic evaluation . After discharge , cause patient 's dyspnea determine independent review entire medical record perform two emergency physician . In case disagreement , third expert physician review entire medical record , adjudicate case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study protocol After initial standard work-up , include past medical history , history present illness , physical examination , ECG , arterial blood gas analysis , emergency physician responsible patient care ask categorize diagnosis ADHF non-cardiogenic dyspnea . Then , patient assign one experimental arm . In LUS arm , emergency physician perform LUS , express new integrate presumptive etiology ( `` LUS-implemented '' diagnosis ) . All patient undergo CXR . In CXR arm , patient undergo CXR , new integrate etiology record CXR NT-proBNP result available . After hospital discharge , two expert emergency physician , blind LUS result , independently review entire medical record , indicate final diagnosis . In case disagreement , cardiologist review medical record , adjudicate case . Statistical analysis The accuracy diagnostic tool express sensitivity , specificity , predictive value likelihood ratio obtain use 2 x 2 table . `` Positive '' `` negative '' result consider , test , diagnosis ADHF non-cardiac dyspnea , respectively . Receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) area curve ( AUC ) statistic also show .</detailed_description>
