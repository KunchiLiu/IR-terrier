	<brief_summary>Background : - Some sickle cell disease beta-thalassemia cured transplant . Researchers want test variation transplant use low dose radiation combination immunosuppressive drug . They want know help body well accept donor stem cell . Objectives : - To see low dose radiation ( 300 rad ) , oral cyclophosphamide , pentostatin , sirolimus help body well accept donor stem cell . Eligibility : - People 16 old beta-thalassemia sickle cell disease cure transplant , donor . Design : - Participants donor screen medical history , physical exam , blood test , tissue blood typing , bone marrow sample . They visit social worker . - Donors : - may receive intravenous ( IV ) tube groin vein . - receive drug injection daily 5 6 day move blood stem cell bone marrow general blood circulation . - undergo apheresis : IV put vein arm . Blood take one arm , machine remove white blood cell contain blood stem cell , rest return arm . - Participants : - may undergo red cell exchange procedure . - remain hospital 30 day . - receive large IV line stay body transplant recovery . - receive dose radiation , transplant relate drug mouth IV . - receive blood stem cell 8 hour IV . - take neuropsychological test may complete questionnaire throughout transplant process . - must stay near NIH 4 month . They visit outpatient clinic weekly . - 5 follow-up visit 3 year transplant , annually .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our ongoing nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) transplant protocol ( 03-H-0170 ) patient severe sickle cell disease ( SCD ) B-thalassemia HLA-matched family donor excellent result thus far . Our long term leukocyte engraftment rate 85-90 % disease-free survival . None engraft patient acute sickle-related event , significant toxicity associate condition regimen , evidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . While result rival transplant outcome low risk transplant patient B-thalassemia , area improvement . The first 10-15 % graft rejection rate , majority individual male donor female recipient pair . Another limitation significant delay donor red cell engraftment one recipient pre-existing allo-antibody donor red cell previous transfusion . Also exclude another group individual preform antibody , recipient major ABO incompatibility donor . To overcome limitation ( reduce transplant failure rate ) new protocol , continue nonmyeloablative approach patient SCD B-thalassemia HLA-matched family donor , use increase intensity regimen subset consider high risk transplant failure . This modified regimen consist pentostatin oral cyclophosphamide , hypothesize reduce T cell mediate leukocyte rejection B/plasma cell produce anti-donor erythrocyte antibody . The main transplant backbone remain alemtuzumab , low dose total body irradiation 300 cGy , sirolimus ; transplant graft remain unmanipulated G-CSF mobilized , T-cell replete , PBSC product hematopoietic lymphoid reconstitution . The primary endpoint study percentage/number patient sustain donor type hemoglobin 1 year post transplant male donor female recipient . The primary endpoint pre-existing antibody presence donor red cell reticulocytes great equal to30 k/uL 2 year post-transplant . Other endpoint include toxicity pentostatin-cyclophosphamide regimen , degree donor-host chimerism necessary long-term graft survival disease amelioration , incidence acute chronic GVHD , incidence graft rejection , transplant-related morbidity , well disease-free overall survival . Since SCD B-thalassemia non-malignant disorder red cell , severe GVHD , lack donor erythrocyte ( prolonged donor red cell aplasia ) , graft rejection collectively consider transplant failure .</detailed_description>
