	<brief_title>Effect Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty Versus Travoprost Circardian Intraocular Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Selective laser trabeculoplasty effective treatment lower intraocular pressure patient open-angle glaucoma . Clinical evaluation effectiveness individual patient usually derive baseline post-laser measurement intraocular pressure office hour sit position . Only study examine efficacy laser trabeculoplasty beyond office hour . Although 24-hour effect laser trabeculoplasty study , study conduct use new potent intraocular pressure lower drug . So n't study determine effect selective laser trabeculoplasty travoprost reduce diurnal nocturnal variation Iintraocular pressure .</detailed_description>
