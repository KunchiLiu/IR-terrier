	<brief_summary>Primary axillary hyperhidrosis common idiopathic disorder eccrine sweat gland interfere daily activity cause significant social distress . This pilot study design evaluate efficacy histologic effect 1210nm diode laser treatment axillary hyperhidrosis . Initial result may inform design anticipate large prospective control trial . Study participant receive one laser treatment one randomly-assigned axilla use 1210 nm diode laser , two treatment opposite axilla . Changes sweat measure quantitative gravimetric analysis sweat production expert panel evaluation photograph starch-iodine test perform axilla . Participants also ask subjectively classify severity axillary sweating . These measure perform pretreatment one , three , six month follow treatment . Biopsies axillae do two week treatment ass histologic change eccrine gland surround structure . Treatment axillary hyperhidrosis 1210nm diode laser novel approach base unique absorption characteristic wavelength . We hypothesize selective heating lipid appropriate tissue level impact adjacent eccrine gland typically seat dermo-hypodermal junction , lead subjective and/or objective decrease eccrine secretion . This type treatment may offer effective , non-invasive safe alternative current treatment modality .</brief_summary>
