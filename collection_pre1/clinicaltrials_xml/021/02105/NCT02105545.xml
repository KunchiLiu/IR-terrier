	<brief_summary>The goal study develop new , local system use special test base patient ' genetic makeup well tailor cancer care University New Mexico Cancer Center . The Food Drug Administration already approve forty ( 40 ) drug treat cancer patient base specific genetic makeup , agent development support new approach treatment , often refer `` personalized medicine . '' The goal perform specific test patient ' genetic material discover tumor-specific , single nucleotide variation ( SNVs ) form genetic change ( call epigenetic change ) detect compare normal tissue tumor tissue . This help guide cancer care decision may effective patient . These call clinically actionable finding , CAF . Additional health related finding may make , related cancer condition , diseases syndrome . These call secondary finding ( SF ) . In study investigator also measure often find SF discus possible impact aspects patient ' health . If patient want know finding , discuss panel expert include genetic counselor . Finally , investigator compare often CAF SF differ identify nationwide sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genome Sequencing Human Cancer Tissues</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For brevity , investigator include approach whole genome sequencing , whole exome sequence protein-coding exon , enrichment sequencing methylated DNA RNA transcriptome-sequencing broad category term , Whole Genome Sequencing ( WGS ) . The development rapid low cost next-generation genome sequence technology brings promise new era precision therapeutic clinical practice , associate significant challenge , include reproducible generation high-quality sequence data need comprehensive data analysis interpretation translatable clinical action . Equally critical ethical , legal , social issue surround introduction WGS test clinical application multiethnic , multicultural population , particularly historically experience discrimination even unethical research practice . Of particular concern issue surround privacy , ownership , storage , use WGS data .</detailed_description>
