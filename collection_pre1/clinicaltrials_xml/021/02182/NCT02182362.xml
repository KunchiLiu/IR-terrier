	<brief_summary>The main objective investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) BI 201335 NA healthy male subject without Gilbert 's syndrome polymorphism ( GS ) follow oral administration single dose ( Day 1 ) repeat dos ( Days 4-24 ) 20 mg , 48 mg , 120 mg , 240 mg. Additionally , safety , tolerability , PK high tolerate dose BI 201335 NA ( determine multiple-rising-dose phase ) assess healthy male subject GS 28-day continuous drug administration period .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy male accord follow criterion : Complete medical history , physical examination , vital sign ( Blood Pressure , Pulse Rate ) , 12lead ECG ( electrocardiogram ) , clinical laboratory test Age ≥18 Age ≤55 year BMI ≥18.5 BMI ≤30 kg/m2 ( Body Mass Index ) Signed date write informed consent prior admission study accordance GCP ( Good Clinical Practice ) local legislation Any finding medical examination ( include BP , PR ECG ) deviate normal clinical relevance Any evidence clinically relevant concomitant disease Gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , respiratory , cardiovascular , metabolic , immunological hormonal disorder Subjects polymorphisms associate Gilbert 's syndrome exclude initial 4 group multiple rise dose phase study . However , subject Gilbert 's polymorphism allow participate last group treat high tolerate dose determine multiple rise dose phase trial Prior history jaundice subject without Gilbert 's polymorphism Surgery gastrointestinal tract ( except appendectomy ) Diseases central nervous system ( epilepsy ) psychiatric disorder neurological disorder History relevant orthostatic hypotension , faint spell blackouts Chronic relevant acute infection History relevant allergy/hypersensitivity ( include allergy drug excipients ) Intake drug long halflife ( &gt; 24 hour ) within least one month le 10 halflives respective drug prior administration trial Use drug might reasonably influence result trial prolong QT/QTc interval within 30 day prior screen trial completion Participation another trial investigational drug within two month prior administration trial Smoking ( &gt; 10 cigarette &gt; 3 cigar &gt; 3 pipes/day ) Inability refrain smoke trial Alcohol abuse ( 60 g/day ) Inability refrain alcohol trial Drug abuse Blood donation ( 100 mL within four week prior administration trial ) Excessive physical activity ( within one week prior administration trial ) Any laboratory value outside reference range clinical relevance A mark baseline prolongation QT/QTc interval ( e.g. , repeated demonstration QTc interval &gt; 450 m ) A history additional risk factor TdP ( Torsades de point ) ( e.g. , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history Long QT Syndrome )</criteria>
