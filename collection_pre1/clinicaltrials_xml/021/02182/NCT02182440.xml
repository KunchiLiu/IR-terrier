	<brief_title>A Safety , Tolerability , Efficacy QoL Study Human recAP Treatment Patients With SA-AKI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design : Adaptive trial two stage interim analysis - Stage 1 : four arm ; three dose group placebo . n=30/arm . ( n=120 ) - Interim analysis base 120 subject , continue recruitment , add 11 subject Stage 1 safety population ( n=131 ) : evaluate safety select dose stage 2 - Stage 2 : one dose group placebo . N=85/arm . ( n=170 ) Total n study : 301 . Primary objective - To investigate effect recAP renal function ( measure creatinine clearance D1-D7 period , incidence duration renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) 28 day , eGFR D60 D90 ) relate clinical parameter ( ICU stay , Hospital stay , Mechanical ventilation 28 day , SOFA SAPS2 score 28 day ) patient SA-AKI . - To determine effective therapeutic dose ( ) recAP . Secondary objective - To investigate safety tolerability recAP patient SA AKI . ( assessed independent Data Monitoring Board , adverse event 90 day study period , laboratory value , ECG , physical examniations , vital sign , Anti Drug Antibodies ) - To investigate pharmacokinetic profile ( PK ) recAP subset patient ( part 1 , n=120 ) SA AKI . ( Population PK ; AUC D1-7 , Cmax , Cmin , Tmax , terminal T1/2 ) - To investigate immunogenic potential recAP patient SA AKI . ( anti-drug antibody D14 , D28 , D60 D90 ) - To investigate effect quality life ( use EuroQol , EQ-5D ) follow study inclusion , ICU discharge , Day 90 . Other objective • To evaluate whether specific patient group identify benefit recAP treatment patient group non-responders</detailed_description>
