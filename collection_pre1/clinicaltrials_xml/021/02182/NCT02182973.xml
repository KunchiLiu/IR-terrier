	<brief_title>Donor Human Milk Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ( NAS ) drug withdrawal syndrome occur primarily antenatal exposure opiate . Symptoms may present birth , often peak 48-72 delivery . The onset symptom affect half-life opiate use pregnancy combination maternal infant metabolism . The incidence NAS increase substantially since 2000 nationally Commonwealth Kentucky , lead significant increase healthcare resource utilization ( Figure 1 ) . The 2012 National Survey Drug Use Health find illicit drug abuse affect ~130,000 pregnancy United States 2011-2012 approximately 20 % pregnancy ( 26,000 ) involve opiate . ( SAMSA Center Behavioral Health Statistics Quality , National Survey Drug Use Health , 2009-2012 ) . Patrick et al . utilized Kids ' Inpatient Database ( KID ) Agency Health Care Research Quality evaluate incidence maternal opiate use pregnancy ( 1 ) . He team note substantial increase number mother use opiate - 1.19 per 1000 hospital birth 2000 5.63 per 1000 hospital birth 2009 . As result , increase diagnosis NAS 1.20 per 1000 hospital birth 2000 3.39 per 1000 hospital birth 2009 . This 2.8-fold increase mean every hour every day , 1 neonate United States undergoes drug withdrawal . The Kentucky Injury Prevention Research Center report 824 infant state Kentucky hospitalize neonatal withdrawal exposure opiates 2012 . This represent 18 % increase 2011 4.5 fold increase 2005 . ( Kentucky Injury Prevention Research Center . Data 2010-2012 ) . NAS issue epidemic proportion Kentucky nation . It result prolong hospitalization increase healthcare cost . In 2009 , total charge NAS treatment note approximately $ 720 million nationally , approximately $ 190 million 2000 ( 1 ) . Kentucky data 2012 report $ 40 million dollar cost neonatal drug withdrawal treatment , increase $ 200,000 2000 . ( Kentucky Injury Prevention Research Center . Data 2010-2012 ) . The majority cost ( 75-80 % ) pay state Medicaid program ( Figure 2 ) . Precipitous removal exogenous opiate time delivery result unopposed stimulation cAMP increase norepinephrine level result clinical symptom drug withdrawal neonate ( 2 ) . Symptoms include central nervous system ( CNS ) sign ( seizure , irritability , tremor ) , autonomic disturbance ( sweat , yawn , nasal stuffiness , low grade fever , mottle ) gastrointestinal ( GI ) dysfunction ( diarrhea , vomit , poor feeding , regurgitation ) . The cohort withdrawal symptom dictate location µ opioid receptor , concentrate brain also find sensory nerve , mast cell GI tract ( 3 ) . Treatment withdrawal symptom include symptomatic care mild symptom pharmacological intervention addition symptomatic care moderate severe symptom . The American Academic Pediatrics ( AAP ) expert field recommend opioid replacement therapy first line pharmacologic intervention opioid-induced withdrawal . The commonly used medication oral morphine . Phenobarbital clonidine use adjuvant therapy success infant severe symptom . Initiation , escalation wean pharmacologic therapy base observer rat scale , common Finnegan Scale ( 4 ) . Although observer-rated scale essential component assessment treatment neonatal drug withdrawal , lack rigorous psychometric test establish reliability validity , subjective difficult standardize across nursery ( 5 ) . Infants undergo opiate withdrawal , note , feed difficulty , include spitting , regurgitation diarrhea . The Finnegan score tool include series feed assessment within total score algorithm ( Table 1 ) . Human milk show best tolerate nutritional support infant cite AAP prefer method feeding infant ( 6 ) . However , AAP considers use marijuana , cocaine , methamphetamine unsupervised opiate use pregnancy contraindication breastfeeding ( 7 ) . For street drug , risk infant ongoing active use mother outweigh benefit breastfeed dos drug ( ) use contaminant within drug unknown ( 8-11 ) . The AAP recognize mother supervise methadone treatment center free use drug abuse breastfeed essential component infant 's care . However , infant NAS feed formula variety reason , include concern continue maternal use . Human milk complete nutritional food first 6 month life term infant . Aside nutritional composition ( specific support human infant ) , contain hormone , immunoglobulins growth factor stimulate gastrointestinal growth motility , turn , promote maturation protection GI tract . Mediators neurotensin motilin promote GI motility free amino acid fee intestinal growth ( 12,13 ) . Human milk feed show increase gastric empty ( 14,15 ) lactase activity ( 16 ) gut improve feed tolerance . A human milk diet also associate post-natal intestinal colonization beneficial bacteria ( Lactobacillus Bifidobacteria ) . In summary , compare formula feeding , human milk appear suitable diet neonate risk GI dysfunction . Two retrospective study effect breastfeed clinical symptom NAS report . McQueen et al review 28 mother-infant pair maternal methadone exposure infant symptom NAS ( 17 ) . Maternal infant demographic record along feed type , Finnegan score infant medication utilization withdrawal . Feeding cohort create quantify duration breastfeed hospitalization . Formula feed infant receive &gt; 75 % feeding formula ( n=9 ) , breastfed infant receive &gt; 75 % feeding breast ( n=8 ) . The rest consider combination feeder ( n=11 ) . Combination feeder slightly less mature ( 35.6 week ) low birth weight ( 2608 g ) breastfed ( 38.8 week 3025 g ) formula feed ( 39.1 week 3302 gram ) . Breastfed infant receive few score , significantly low overall Finnegan score few score &gt; 8 compare formula combination feed infant ( p≤0.001 ) . Dryden et al . perform retrospective cohort study 437 infant born woman prescribe methadone varying dos addiction ( 18 ) . Median gestational age birth 38 week birth weight 2730 gram . Twenty-two percent infant breastfed least 72 hour . Multivariate logistic regression show prescribe dose methadone woman independently influence likelihood pharmacologic treatment NAS ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . However , infant breastfed least 72 hour , odds need pharmacologic treatment NAS significantly reduce ( OR 0.55 , 95 % confidence interval 0.34 - 0.88 , p=0.013 ) . Maternal opiate transmit breast milk infant . The amount methadone buprenorphine transfer breast milk find small , may significant enough lead improvement score . While study report improvement ( decrease ) NAS score reduced duration treatment breastfeeding , report look donor human milk , test free illicit drug , effect GI sub-scores Finnegan algorithm . Given general benefit human milk human infant limit report improve neonatal well-being breastfed infant NAS , study design develop pilot data acceptability benefit donor human milk infant undergoing pharmacologic treatment NAS . Specifically , GI sub-scores , well total score , compare infant historically feed formula enrol 2-week donor human milk study period . Purpose study : test follow null hypothesis : Infants diagnosis neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) due in-utero exposure opiate , feed donor human milk , similar GI/feeding sub-scores Finnegan score tool compare ( historic ) infant feed formula . A rejection null hypothesis use design randomize trial donor human milk infant NAS . Methods : Once infant 's withdrawal symptom stabilize oral morphine mother agree participation ( sign inform consent research authorization ) , infant assign receive donor human milk ( Co-op donor milk , Medolac Laboratories , Lake Oswego , OR ) period 2 week . Vitamin supplementation nutritional adjustment discretion attend physician . Infant Finnegan score assess accord current NAS protocol . Oral morphine dosing ( increase wean dos ) consistent current NAS protocol . See data collection sheet detailed list variable . Statistical analysis : Descriptive statistic provide . As pilot study , inferential statistic apply .</detailed_description>
