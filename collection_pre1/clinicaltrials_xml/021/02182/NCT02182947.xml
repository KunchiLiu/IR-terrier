	<brief_summary>Most study evaluate role MRE WCE conduct pediatric patient retrospective main goal make diagnosis patient suspect IBD . The current study first prospective study child know IBD assess role MRE WCE identify disease exacerbation . This study help identify capsule endoscopy superior complementary MRE evaluation suspect disease exacerbation IBD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There grow concern recurrent radiation exposure particularly routine radiologic modality child , especially relevant pediatric Crohn 's Disease far CT entercolysis abdomen small bowel series often see complementary . Although small bowel series accept routine diagnostic modality pediatric IBD fluoroscopy time keep minimum , limitation well define especially relevant early stage IBD wherein fistulising , stricturing disease less common . Magnetic resonance enterography ( MRE ) diagnostic effectiveness comparable radiological modality evaluation adult patient CD , without radiation exposure . However limited expense , availability requisite equipment software , need sedation pediatric population , limited expertise accurate interpretation especially early lesion common pediatric IBD , overall insensitivity early mucosal lesion include vascular abnormality . Alternative modality small bowel image study include routine use wireless-video capsule endoscopy ( WCE ) allow visualization small-bowel mucosal lesions Crohn 's disease . Because risk capsule retention suspect establish Crohn 's disease significantly increase ; series 13 % ; pre WCE small bowel image patency capsule become standard care . The main indication WCE Crohn 's disease establish diagnosis , assess disease prognosis , disease activity , mucosal heal post therapy , define extent severity disease A small , prospective study 27 patient suspect Crohn 's disease , reveal sensitivity 93 % specificity 84 % WCE examination compare surgical enteroscopic tissue sample , demonstrate significant change management Another prospective randomized blind study adult ( N = 21 ) report sensitivity specificity CD terminal ileum 100 % 91 % WCE . Jensen suggest WCE first line modality detection small bowel CD beyond reach colonoscopy . In adult know CD , Karoui et al evaluate WCE prospective study ( N = 20 ) compare radiological technique conclude WCE accurate detection small bowel lesion CD .</detailed_description>
