	<brief_summary>The sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome ( SAHS ) respiratory disorder characterize frequent breathing cessation ( apnea ) partial collapse ( hypopnea ) sleep . These respiratory event lead deep oxygen desaturations , blood pressure heart rate acute change , increase sympathetic activity cortical arousal . The gold standard method SAHS diagnosis in-hospital , technician-attended overnight polysomnography ( PSG ) . However , methodology labor-intensive , expensive time-consuming , lead large wait list , delay diagnosis treatment . Blood oxygen saturation ( SpO2 ) nocturnal pulse oximetry ( NPO ) provide relevant information detect apnea , easily record ambulatory less expensive highly reliable . The investigator hypothesize automatic analysis single oximetric recording home could provide essential information diagnosis SAHS . The aim study two-fold : firstly , research focus assess reliability usefulness NPO carry patient 's home context SAHS detection , secondly , study aim assess performance automatic regression model AHI mean neural network use information NPO recording . To achieve goal , PSG NPO study carry . A polysomnography equipment ( E-Series , Compumedics ) use standard in-hospital PSG study , whereas portable pulseoximeter ( WristOX2 3150 , Nonin ) use ambulatory NPO . NPO carry day immediately PSG patient 's home . Patients assign carry NPO study in-hospital PSG randomly . In addition , in-hospital attend oximetry also perform simultaneously PSG use portable pulseoximeter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects study recruit sleep unit `` Hospital Universitario RÃ­o Hortega '' ( HURH ) Valladolid ( Spain ) . All subject derive sleep unit due suspicion suffer SAHS . The whole population set subsequently divided training set test set . The training set use compose regression model , whereas test set use assess performance . The standard apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) PSG use diagnose SAHS . According American Academy Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) rule , apnea define drop airflow signal great equal 90 % baseline last least 10 , whereas hypopnea define drop great equal 50 % least 10 accompanied desaturation great equal 3 % and/or arousal . Subjects AHI &gt; = 10 event per hour ( e/h ) diagnose suffer SAHS . A portable pulseoximeter ( WristOX2 3150 , Nonin ) use ambulatory NPO . NPO carry day immediately PSG patient 's home . Patients assign carry NPO study in-hospital PSG randomly . In addition , oximetry also perform simultaneously PSG mean portable pulseoximeter . Therefore , every patient 3 oximetric recording : ( ) SpO2 unattended portable monitoring home , ( ii ) SpO2 attend in-hospital portable monitoring ( iii ) SpO2 attend in-hospital standard PSG . SpO2 record sample rate 1 Hz . All SpO2 recording save separate file process offline . An automatic signal pre-processing stage carry remove artifact . Our methodology divide two stage : feature extraction pattern recognition . Oximetric recording parameterized mean 16 feature four feature subset compose initial feature set oximetry : time domain statistic , frequency domain statistic , conventional spectral measure nonlinear feature . All feature compute whole overnight recording . - Features 1 4 . First fourth-order moment ( M1t - M4t ) time domain : arithmetic mean ( M1t ) , variance ( M2t ) , skewness ( M3t ) kurtosis ( M4t ) apply quantify central tendency , amount dispersion , asymmetry peakedness , respectively . - Features 5 8 . First fourth-order moment ( M1f - M4f ) frequency domain . - Feature 9 . Median frequency ( MF ) , define component comprises 50 % signal power . - Feature 10 . Spectral entropy ( SE ) , disorder quantifier related flatness spectrum . - Feature 11 . Total spectral power ( PT ) , compute total area PSD . - Feature 12 . Peak amplitude ( PA ) apnea frequency band , local maximum spectral content frequency range 0.014 - 0.033 Hz . - Feature 13 . Relative power ( PR ) , ratio area enclose PSD apnea frequency band total signal power . - Feature 14 . Sample entropy ( SampEn ) , quantify irregularity time series , large value correspond irregular data . - Feature 15 . Central tendency measure ( CTM ) , provide variability measure second order difference plot . - Feature 16 . Lempel - Ziv complexity ( LZC ) , measure complexity link rate new subsequence repetition along signal . The second stage corresponds regression analysis , aim provide analytical expression AHI function extract feature . A multilayer perceptron ( MLP ) neural network use . MLP networks model express knowledge use connectionist paradigm inspire human brain . They compose multiple simple unit neuron know perceptrons . Perceptrons arrange several interconnected layer . Each network connection two associate network adaptive parameter weight . MLP network single hidden layer compose nonlinear perceptrons ( i.e. , nonlinear activation function ) implement since capable universal approximation . The propose regression task aim approximate 1-D continuous variable represent AHI . Thus , single output unit linear activation function require .</detailed_description>
