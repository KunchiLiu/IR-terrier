	<brief_summary>Increased Intracranial Hypertension ( IIH ) , also know Pseudotumor Cerebri , define increased cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) pressure absence intracranial , metabolic , toxic hormonal cause intracranial hypertension . It characterize headache , tinnitus visual loss , due optic atrophy , 50 % case . Surgical treatment , CSF shunt placement optic nerve sheath fenestration ( ONSF ) , indicate case failure non-compliance ( owe side effect ) medical treatment ( mainly include weight loss drug , Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors ) . However , surgical treatment limited relative high complication recurrence rate . Indeed , improvement visual function ONSF often transient risk complication , include visual loss , pupillary dysfunction , vascular complication 40 % . With good treatment option , intraventricular lumbar shunt placement become traditional treatment medically refractory IIH , despite poor result . Indeed , series patient IIH treat shunt replacement report complication rate ( shunt occlusion , disconnection , infection intracranial hematoma formation ) around 50 % failure rate 64 % within 6 month . As consequence , shunt revision often required efficacy technique control disease questionable . The role intracranial transverse sinus stenosis IIH recently gain particular interest . Despite fact transverse sinus stenosis IIH may due increase intracranial pressure , author believe rise intracranial pressure effect worsen secondary appearance venous sinus stenosis . To date , complication report IIH patient venous sinus stent placement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite fact result venous stenting IIH still preliminary , suggest technique could become viable alternative medically refractory IIH patient transverse sinus stenosis . However , prospective study long-term , standardized independent follow-up require evaluate new alternative high level evidence . Normalization CSF pressure present venous sinus stenting 6 month 70 % patient cohort medically refractory IIH patient . ( Refractory IIH define absence improvement papilledema , visual function headache three month medical treatment intolerance medical regimen ) . A complementary hypothesis mean decrease CSF pressure post stenting equal 15 mmHg . The propose research prospective cohort study aim assess efficacy venous stenting normalize CSF pressure improve symptom quality life patient medically refractory IIH . Concomitantly ; also estimate recurrence complication rate . The study conduct locally The Ottawa Hospital aim enrol 33 patient trial . Interventions The goal study assess overall efficacy venous stenting normalize patient CSF pressure little risk . The premise study open venous sinus reduce patient 's intracranial pressure improve visual capability . Therefore ; aim treatment improve patient 's overall symptomology relate IIH . The interventionalist interventional team blind study procedure study material use trial . Patients undergo stenting venous system venous pressure measurement take . If degree stenosis 50 % difference pressure CSF 8 mmHg , patient stented . Venous pressure measurement transverse sinus stenting First step : Venous pressure measurement Once patient local anesthesia , femoral venous puncture cerebral venogram perform . Once femoral venous access obtain , catheterization right leave jugular vein perform . Microcatheterization sinus venous pressure measurement distal proximal stenosis do . Second step : Procedure In preparation stent , patient receive Aspirin 81mg daily Clopidogrel ( Plavix ® ) 75 mg daily 4 day prior intervention . On day procedure , patient receive general anesthesia plus bolus heparin ( 70UI/Kg ) . Endovascular Intervention : A venous femoral puncture complete allow 6-8 French long sheath placement follow retrograde catheterization right leave jugular vein . Deployment stent across stenosis without venous angioplasty do . Hemostasis manual compression complete end procedure . After procedure patient admit overnight monitoring ( neurosurgery unit ) . Patients discharge home 24 hour procedure continue Aspirin Clopidogrel ( Plavix® ) 75mg every day x 3 month aspirin .</detailed_description>
