	<brief_title>AZD9291 Combination With Ascending Doses Novel Therapeutics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase Ib , open-label , multicentre study AZD9291 administer orally combination novel therapeutic ( AZD6094 selumetinib ( AZD6244 , ARRY142886 ) ) patient EGFRm+ advance NSCLC . The study design allow investigation optimal combination dose schedule whilst ensure safety patient intensive safety monitoring . There two part study . Part A , Combination dose find Part B , Dose expansion . AZD9291 ( osimertinib ) potent irreversible inhibitor single epidermal growth factor receptor sensitise mutation positive ( EGFRm+ ) ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor [ TKI ] sensitivity-conferring mutation ) dual EGFRm+/T790M+ ( TKI resistance-conferring mutation ) receptor form EGFR . AZD9291 therefore potential provide clinical benefit patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harbour single sensitivity mutation resistance mutation follow prior therapy EGFR TKI . AZD9291 ( osimertinib ) award FDA accelerate approval November 2015 , follow conditional approval EU , full approval Japan additional market 2016 , treatment patient EGFR T790M+ NSCLC progress EGFR TKI therapy . Enrolment patient cohort evaluate AZD9291 treatment combination MEDI4736 1st line treatment terminate due increase incidence ILD-like event ( interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis ) , longer evaluate study . The combination dose AZD9291 + AZD6094 conduct Japan since clinical data Japanese patient take AZD6094 monotherapy . Therefore , Amendment Protocol add Part C applicable Japan , assess safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics monotherapy AZD6094 Japanese patient advance NSCLC purpose conduct dose expansion ( Part B ) Japan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>( summarize due limitation character ) 1 . Written inform consent 2 . Aged least 18 year ( 20 year Japan ) 3 . Histological cytological confirmation diagnosis EGFRm+ NSCLC . Confirmation previous archival sample tumour harbour EGFRm+ know associated EGFR TKI sensitivity . 4 . Radiological documentation disease progression previous continuous treatment EGFR TKI ( last treatment administer prior enrol study ) Part B cMET+ve patient : No prior treatment 3rd generation TKI : least one prior line therapy 1st 2nd generation EGFR TKI , 3rd generation ( T790Mdirected ) EGFR TKI . Prior treatment 3rd generation TKI : least one prior line therapy 3rd generation ( T790Mdirected ) EGFR TKI EGFRm T790M+ NSCLC . Part B cMETve patient : T790M direct EGFR TKI patient : immediate prior therapy entry study must T790M directed EGFR TKI . ≥2nd line cohort : patient must progress treatment EGFR TKI ( T790M direct EGFR TKIs permit ) . Other prior line therapy may give . 5. cMET status : Prior study entry , local confirmation tumour cMET status acceptable , central result confirm retrospectively . If local test available , central confirmation tumour cMET status must obtain prior study entry . T790M status : Local confirmation tumour T790M status acceptable , central result confirm retrospectively . If local testing perform Cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v.2 , central confirmation require . 6 . At least one lesion , previously irradiate , biopsied screening period , accurately measure baseline ≥10 mm long diameter ( except lymph node must short axis ≥15 mm ) CT MRI suitable accurate repeat measurement 7. WHO performance status 01 deterioration previous 2 week minimum life expectancy 12 week 8 . Females use adequate contraceptive measure , must breast feeding must negative pregnancy test prior start dose childbearing potential must evidence nonchildbearing potential . Exclusion Criteria ( summary ) : Treatment EGFR TKI within approximately 5x halflife first dose study treatment . Any cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational agent anticancer drug treatment advance NSCLC previous treatment regimen clinical study within 14 day first dose study treatment . Patients currently receive ( unable stop use ) medication herbal supplement know potent inducer CYP3A4 ( least 3 week prior ) . For AZD6094 patient currently receive ( unable stop use least 2 week ) prior receive first dose , medication know strong inhibitor CYP1A2 . Prior AZD9291 dose present study . Prior current treatment AZD6094 another cMET inhibitor ( allocate AZD9291 + AZD6094 ) . Radiotherapy limit field radiation palliation within 1 week first dose study treatment , exception patient receive radiation 30 % bone marrow wide field radiation must complete within ≥4 week first dose study treatment . Major ( anticipated major ) surgical procedure ( exclude placement vascular access ) significant traumatic injury within 4 week first dose study treatment . Currently receive treatment warfarin sodium . With exception alopecia Grade 2 , prior platinumtherapy relate neuropathy , unresolved toxicity prior therapy and/or prestudy biopsy great CTCAE Grade 1 time start study treatment . Spinal cord compression brain metastasis unless asymptomatic , stable require steroid least 2 week prior start study treatment . Severe uncontrolled systemic disease ; know serious active infection ; active hepatitis B C ; cardiac disease ; inadequate bone marrow reserve organ function coagulation parameter ; inadequate liver renal function ; GI event would preclude adequate absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion AZD9291 , AZD6094 selumetinib ; hipersensitivity IP similar drug Past medical history interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) , druginduced ILD , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active ILD .</criteria>
