	<brief_summary>Diarrhea today still major problem develop world high morbidity . Though mortality under-5 child decline year , diarrhea responsible 2.5 million death per year develop country . A median 3.2 episode diarrhea under-5 child per child-year estimate develop country . In Bangladesh , overall prevalence diarrhea estimate 2 % entire population . However , recent survey 2003 urban slum mother indicate prevalence diarrhea range 0.7-4.1 % six divisional city 0.7 % Dhaka slum area . Malnutrition remain major adverse prognostic indicator diarrhea relate morbidity , emphasize importance nutrition early management . Repeated episode diarrhea frequent cause consequence malnutrition . To improve diarrhea situation Bangladesh elsewhere , intervention direct reduce mortality morbidity improvement breast-feeding practice , complementary feeding , sanitation , increase measles immunization rate , micronutrient supplementation , oral rehydration therapy . L-lysine , essential amino acid , require healthy growth , tissue repair enzyme production . It protein-building block strengthens nourishes structural , circulatory immune system . It produce body like essential amino acid must obtain diet . Some natural food source L-lysine include Lima bean , kidney bean , potato , corn , red meat , fish milk . The mean requirement lysine healthy human adult 30 mg/kg body weight/day 50 mg/g protein intake . Studies show lysine therapy improve immune status use therapeutic agent herpes simplex viral infection . A double-blind randomized trial L-lysine treatment find effective agent significant reduction occurrence , severity healing time recurrent herpes simplex viral infection . Lysine fortification increase blood level complement 3 ( C3 ) , CD-4 CD-8 T-cells compare control . These two study suggest supplementation lysine food fortification enhance immunological status . A recent study also show effect lysine diarrheal incidence severity . An experimental model suggest inhibitory effect L-lysine incidence diarrhea induce stress 5-hydroxytryptamine . A community trial among adult Syria show period prevalence mean duration diarrheal illness significantly low female participant consume lysine-fortified wheat bread compare control group well well immunological parameter C3c delta . The propose study observe impact daily dose 2000 mg supplemental L-lysine 6 month diarrheal illness adult population urban slum area Dhaka whose principal diet base cereal rice wheat . The daily protein lysine availability diet Bangladeshi population calculate 43g 1883 mg respectively , compare 113g 7,598 mg respectively USA . This mean 2000 mg daily supplementation L-lysine would pose detrimental effect , combine usual supplemental intake still substantially low compare intake USA . However , expect , supplemental L-lysine may reduce incidence severity diarrheal illness improvement nutritional immunological status study population . The investigator propose conduct community-based , double-blind randomize controlled trial Mirpur area Dhaka city . Adults age 18 45 year reside catchment area least last six month eligible study . A total 440 subject ( 220 female ) enrol . The result propose study contribute exist knowledge effect lysine incidence severity diarrheal illness well immune status . A positive impact lysine supplementation diarrheal illness may lead future strategic approach control diarrhea global public health problem .</brief_summary>
