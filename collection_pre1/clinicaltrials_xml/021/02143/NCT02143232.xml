	<brief_summary>The investigator propose deploy interactive device monitor patient 's recovery vital sign home joint replacement . These early discharge patient day next morning . The goal support early discharge create safe , control , monitor environment home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Background rationale . According late Canadian Census , senior age 65 increase number 609,810 13.7 % population 2006 4,945,060 , 14.8 % 2011 . In Ontario , 2001 , 8,000 total hip replacement ( THR ) 11,000 total knee replacement ( TKR ) ; 2016 , projection 20,000 THR 54,000 TKR , assume age-specific rate remain ( 1 ) . At The Ottawa Hospital ( TOH ) , already witnessed pressure bed management due increase case volume . As solution , successfully organize early discharge ( EDc ) , day , select patient unicompartment arthroplasty order reduce length stay ( LOS ) ( 2 ) . Since , discharge select major joint replacement patient day overnight stay multimodal analgesia . A remote patient monitor interactive system chronic disease care . This monitor allow telephone wireless connectivity patient equip NIBP ( non-invasive blood pressure ) , HR ( heart rate ) , SpO2 ( pulse oximetry ) measurements patient caretaker could use home . It generate regular reminder patient measure his/her NIBP , HR , glucose level appropriate SpO2 well answer script questionnaire pain . Results alert transmit healthcare team . The system never deploy acute care post-op environment . We propose therefore conduct feasibility study early discharge patient unicompartment total joint replacement , deploy Telus interactive RPM exist early discharge care path . 2 . Methods This feasibility study allow plan large future study prove hypothesis . A sample size 54 sufficient yield one-sided 95 % confidence interval estimate around primary outcome measure ( proportion successful transmission ) low bound exceed cutpoint feasibility 90 % , assume proportion 95 % successful transmission . Recruitment orthopedic clinic , use approve OHRI `` Consent Personal Health Information Review Research Purposes '' obtain member circle care . Informed consent obtain General Pre-Admission Unit ( PAU ) research assistant eligibility determine . A screening process unicompartment knee arthroplasty care path day discharge currently place . For study , care path day / early discharge total hip knee arthroplasty confirm . Theses care path include home visit nurse physio Community Care Access Centre ( CCAC ) . Patients satisfy early discharge criterion approach . After informed consent use remote patient monitoring device demonstrate . prior discharge , ensure patient achieve define outcome care path , functionality device review patient care-taker . The patient give monitor bring home set . If require member study team assist set use device This may require home visit . CCAC visit outline care path late next day . Monitoring continue 4 day home.The system repatriate TOH clean preventative maintenance . Post-operative complication document Day 4 followup phone call 30 day , include POMI ( postoperative myocardial infarction ) , CHF ( congestive heart failure ) , DVT ( deep vein thrombosis ) , PE ( pulmonary embolism ) pneumonia , cardiac dysrhythmia require treatment , wound dehiscence , surgical site infection ( SSI ) . The patient satisfaction questionnaire include concern RPM well healthcare team response complete patient use patient monitoring system within 48 hour monitor completed.A followup phone call occur Day 30 . Results feasibility study use plan future large-scale randomize control trial evaluate effectiveness safety .</detailed_description>
