	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy CG0070 Oncolytic Virus Regimen Patients With High Grade Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The plan study safety efficacy CG0070 high-grade NMIBC patient fail BCG therapy . Most patient NMIBCis ( Cis , Cis Ta and/or T1 , high grade Ta T1 frequent uncontrolled recurrence ) fail BCG intravesical therapy ( standard care ) usually choice proceed cystectomy . Cystectomy surgery associate major morbidity , mortality quality life issue . Morbidity long term tedious medical care rest patient 's life span . Most patient stage show sign disease progression muscle layer metastasis , make surgery difficult decision . CG0070 , successful trial , serve provide therapeutic alternative patient population need . For present study , Cis Cis Ta and/or T1 patient enrol failed BOND study medically unfit surgery . Furthermore , patient high grade Ta T1 disease fail BCG chemotherapy treatment also prone disease progression . Since patient eligible enrolled BOND trial , present study serve alternative access CG0070 experimental treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Patients must pathologically confirm high grade disease ( HG ) , defined 2004 WHO classification system Patients must evidence muscle invasive disease Patient must fall one follow criterion : 1 . Patients first enrol BOND protocol fail achieve complete response relapse follow complete response 3 month receive control treatment 2 . OR patient first enrol BOND protocol relapse follow complete response last year receive CG0070 treatment 3 . OR patient Ta/T1 high grade , refuse cystectomy CG0070 naïve 4 . OR patient exBOND protocol experienced tumor relapse disease progression sustain 12 month longer complete response duration For Cis patient Cis Ta and/or T1 : 1 . Tumor must consider unresectable residual disease . 2 . Patients must declare medically unfit cystectomy . 3 . No disease progression disease status begin BOND trial . For Ta/T1 HG Patients : 1 . They must also receive least one prior course BCG therapy per recommend schedule . Patients either fail BCG induction therapy within sixmonth period successfully treat BCG , subsequently find recurrence . The standard course intravesical BCG therapy must include least six weekly treatment ( allowable range instillation per course 49 ) within sixmonth period 2 . They must receive 2 intravesical chemotherapy regimens BCG 3 . They must relapse within 6 month last treatment 18 year age old Radical cystectomy decline patient sign special section inform consent , whereby clear explanation investigator subject delay cystectomy may increase his/her chance disease progression , result may lead serious life threaten consequence . Patients must able enter study within five week recent diagnostic procedure , usually diagnostic biopsy , transurethral resection bladder tumor ( TURBT ) procedure diagnostic scanning CT PET procedure . Histopathologically confirm , transitional cell ( urothelial ) carcinoma . Urothelial tumor mixed histology ( &lt; 50 % variant ) eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 . Not pregnant lactate Patients child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception Agree study specific inform consent HIPAA authorization release personal health information Adequate baseline CBC , renal hepatic function . Parameters describe .WBC &gt; 3000 cells/mm3 , ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; 10g/dL , platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Adequate renal function : serum creatinine &lt; 2.0mg/dL Bilirubin , AST ALT 2 x Upper Limits Normal PT/INR , PTT , fibrinogen within institutional normal limit Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 800/μL first dose CG0070 Previous systemic chemotherapy radiation bladder cancer . Note : Prior immunotherapy intravesical ( administer within bladder ) chemotherapy superficial disease acceptable History anaphylactic reaction follow exposure humanize human therapeutic monoclonal antibody , hypersensitivity GMCSF yeast derive product , clinically meaningful allergic reaction know hypersensitivity prior reaction formulation excipients study drug . Known infection HIV , HBV HCV . Anticipated use chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy specify study protocol study Any underlying medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , make administration study vector hazardous patient , would obscure interpretation adverse event , permit adequate surgical resection . Systemic treatment investigational clinical trial within 28 day prior registration . Concurrent treatment immunosuppressive immunomodulatory agent , include systemic steroid ( exception : inhale topically applied steroid , acute chronic standard dose NSAIDs , permit ) . Use short course ( i.e. , ≤ 1 day ) glucocorticoid acceptable prevent reaction IV contrast use CT scan . Immunosuppressive therapy , include : cyclosporine , antithymocyte globulin , tacrolimus within 3 month study entry . History prior experimental cancer vaccine treatment ( e.g. , dendritic cell therapy , heat shock vaccine ) History stage III great cancer , exclude urothelial cancer . Basal squamous cell skin cancer must adequately treated subject must diseasefree time registration . Subjects history stage I II cancer , must adequately treated diseasefree ≥ 3 year time registration . Progressive viral bacterial infection All infection must resolve patient must remain afebrile seven day without antibiotic prior place study Unwilling unable comply protocol cooperate fully investigator site personnel Evidence disease progression compare disease status BOND protocol NMIBCis patient . Patient relapse less 1 year refractory treatment CG0070 . Cis , Cis Ta and/or T1 patient medically fit cystectomy .</criteria>
