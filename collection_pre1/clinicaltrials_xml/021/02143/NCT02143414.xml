	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well blinatumomab combination chemotherapy dasatinib , prednisone , blinatumomab work treat old patient acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Monoclonal antibody , blinatumomab , find cancer cell help kill . Drugs use chemotherapy , prednisone , vincristine sulfate , methotrexate , mercaptopurine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Dasatinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving blinatumomab combination chemotherapy dasatinib prednisone may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Blinatumomab Combination Chemotherapy Dasatinib , Prednisone , Blinatumomab Treating Older Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 3-year survival rate elderly patient newly diagnose Philadelphia ( Ph ) -negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) treat blinatumomab follow POMP ( prednisone , vincristine sulfate , methotrexate , mercaptopurine ) maintenance . II . To evaluate preliminary manner ( feasibility study ) safety dasatinib-steroid base induction follow blinatumomab treatment combination dasatinib follow dasatinib-based maintenance patient newly diagnose Ph-positive ALL , relapsed/refractory Ph-positive ALL , Ph-like dasatinib-sensitive mutation kinase fusion ( DSMKF ) ALL ( newly-diagnosed relapse refractory ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity patient population treat regimen . II . To estimate rate complete response ( CR ) , complete remission incomplete count recovery ( CRi ) disease-free survival Ph-negative patient . III . To estimate disease-free overall survival Ph-positive ALL Ph-like DSMKF ALL . IV . To estimate cohort rate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negativity , time achieve MRD negativity ( exploratory analysis ) . V. To determine whether anti-idiotype antibody direct blinatumomab develop blinatumomab treatment study . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment cohort accord Philadelphia chromosome status . COHORT I ( PHILADELPHIA CHROMOSOME NEGATIVE PATIENTS ) : INDUCTION : Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously ( IV ) continuously 24 hour day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . RE-INDUCTION : Patients achieve CR CRi Induction , receive blinatumomab IV continuously 24 hour day 1-28 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . POST-REMISSION : Patients receive blinatumomab IV continuously 24 hour day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , mercaptopurine PO day 1-28 , methotrexate PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT II ( PHILADELPHIA CHROMOSOME POSITIVE PATIENTS ) : INDUCTION : Patients receive dasatinib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-84 prednisone PO day 1-24 tapering day 25-32 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . RE-INDUCTION : Patients receive blinatumomab IV continuously 24 hour day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . POST-REMISSION : Patients receive blinatumomab IV continuously 24 hour day 1-28 dasatinib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-42 . Treatment repeat every 42 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive dasatinib PO BID day 1-28 prednisone PO day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 10 year initial registration .</detailed_description>
