	<brief_summary>A comparison skin closure technique ( standard skin closure staple versus continuous ( subcuticular ) absorbable suture ) , determine change rate post operative wound infection elective colorectal surgery patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Subcuticular Continuous Suture Versus Skin Staples Reduce Surgical Site Infections Colorectal Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In colorectal surgery , grow interest study Surgical Site Infections ( SSI ) , outstanding variability report incidence , range 3 % 30 % depend series . Although general risk factor infection identify , still need identify specific risk factor colorectal surgery patient , try reduce number . The technique material use wound closure consider interesting variable study . Main question study : subcuticular ( reabsorbable , continuous ) suture well skin staple reduce wound SSIs colorectal surgery ? The study sponsor Surgical Infection Society Europe , award SIS-E Fellowship young investigator ( 2013 )</detailed_description>
