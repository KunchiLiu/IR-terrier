	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 randomize double-blind dose-escalation clinical trial healthy hookworm-naïve adult conduct George Washington Medical Faculty Associates , Washington , DC , George Washington University School Medicine Health Sciences , Department Microbiology , Immunology Tropical Medicine , Washington , DC . In total , 24 subject progressively enrol 2 cohort 12 subject . In first cohort 8 subject receive 30µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel co-administered 500µg CpG 10104 4 subject receive 100µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® , randomize , double-blinded fashion . In second cohort 8 subject receive 100µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel co-administered 500µg CpG 10104 4 volunteer receive 100µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel , randomize , double-blinded fashion . Vaccinations administer intramuscularly deltoid muscle accord 0 , 2 , 4-month schedule .

	<criteria>Males females 18 50 year , inclusive . Good general health determine mean screening procedure . Available duration trial ( 68 week ) . Willingness participate study evidence sign informed consent document . Able understand comply plan study procedure . Pregnancy determine positive urine human choriogonadotropin ( hCG ) test ( female ) . Participant unwilling use reliable contraception one month follow third immunization ( female surgically sterile , abstinent , least 2 year postmenopausal , determine otherwise medical evaluation sterile ) . Currently lactate breastfeed ( female ) . Evidence clinically significant neurologic , cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , rheumatologic , autoimmune , diabetes , renal disease history , physical examination , and/or laboratory study . A history essential hypertension well control medication consider exclusionary . Has diagnosis schizophrenia , bipolar disease major psychiatric condition would make compliance study visits/procedures difficult ( e.g. , subject psychosis history suicide attempt gesture 3 year study entry , ongoing risk suicide ) . Known suspected immunodeficiency . Laboratory evidence liver disease ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] great 1.25times upper reference limit ) . Laboratory evidence renal disease ( serum creatinine great 1.25times upper reference limit , trace protein blood urine dipstick test exception great 1+ blood detect female menses ) . Laboratory evidence hematologic disease ( hemoglobin &lt; 11.1 g/dl [ female ] &lt; 12.5 g/dl [ male ] ; absolute leukocyte count &lt; 3400/mm3 &gt; 10.8 x 103/mm3 ; platelet count &lt; 140,000/mm3 ) . Laboratory evidence coagulopathy ( activate PTT PT INR great 1.1times upper reference limit ) . Serum glucose great 1.2times upper reference limit . Other condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety right volunteer participate trial would render subject unable comply protocol . Planned participation another investigational vaccine drug trial within 30 day start study Visit # 17 ( 6 month third vaccination ) . Volunteer medical , occupational , family problem result alcohol illicit drug use past 12 month . History severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis . Severe asthma define need daily use inhaler , emergency clinic visit hospitalization within 6 month volunteer 's expect first vaccination study . Positive test hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Positive confirmatory test HIV infection . Positive confirmatory test hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . Use corticosteroid ( exclude topical nasal ) immunosuppressive drug within 30 day volunteer 's expect first vaccination study plan use one month follow last vaccination . Receipt live vaccine within 4 week kill vaccine within 2 week prior volunteer 's expect first vaccination study . Previous receipt NaGST1/Alhydrogel® hookworm vaccine . History surgical splenectomy . Receipt blood product within past 6 month . Preexisting autoimmune antibodymediated disease include limited : systemic lupus erythematosis , rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis , Sjogren 's syndrome , autoimmune thrombocytopenia ; laboratory evidence possible autoimmune disease determine positive antidsDNA titer , positive rheumatoid factor , proteinuria and/or positive ANA .
