	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize vivo MRI and/or CT examination patient , suitably acquire analyzed vascuCAP™ analysis software , provide sufficiently accurate profile plaque characteristic provide objective basis patient management . Study subject include patient undergoing endarterectomy mitigate clinical risk symptom condition include stroke , claudication , critical limb ischemia . The endarterectomy specimens remove surgery allow direct comparison MRI information obtain prior surgery histopathological analysis arterial specimen . The vascuCAP™ measurements structural functional feature arterial wall perform patient undergo endarterectomy . Measured result compare blinded fashion histology assess performance plaque profile build pilot prediction model risk scoring .</detailed_description>
