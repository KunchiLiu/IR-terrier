	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective observational study investigate mechanically ventilated patient treat one new intensive care unit ( ICU ) room less delirium compare patient treat conventional room ICU . The investigator evaluate impact sleep quality , circadian rhythm , global cognitive function general outcome parameter . The investigator record light noise condition ICU room start redesign process ( subproject light noise intensive care unit ( LiNo-ICU ) ) . The investigator compare data regard light noise ICU room redesign process ( non-patient relate data ; ethical vote amendment 08.05.2014 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Delirium one frequently see brain organ dysfunction intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Depending ICU population , 87 % delirium point critical illness . Patients delirium 3fold increase risk dying compare patient without delirium . Studies could show sedation common independent risk factor transition delirium . However , no-sedation approach often challenge . ICU patient sedate often develop severe anxiety agitation . These symptom often treat sedative delirogenic side effect . One major reason anxiety agitation patient ICU environment cause distress . The feeling survey time monitor , expose different kind machinery equipment sometimes work properly major stressor . The objective interdisciplinary research project `` Parametrische ( T ) Raumgestaltung '' development two redesign intensive care room help reduce patient ' anxiety , helplessness stress holistic architectural approach . The patient 's perception need , obvious feeling helplessness fear start point concept able reduce stress factor functional purely technical environment , insufficient light condition noise . Minimizing eliminate common stress factor ICU could reduce need sedative thereby reduce incidence ICU delirium .</detailed_description>
