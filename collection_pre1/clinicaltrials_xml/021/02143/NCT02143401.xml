	<brief_title>Navitoclax Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination navitoclax sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) patient advance solid tumor . ( Dose escalation cohort ) II . To good characterize toxicity profile combination navitoclax sorafenib . ( Expansion cohort ) III . To identify activity treatment combination patient metastatic cancer . ( Dose escalation cohort ) IV . To seek preliminary evidence activity treatment combination patient hepatoma . ( Expansion cohort ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether combination navitoclax sorafenib induces apoptosis detect peripheral blood biomarker analysis . ( Dose escalation cohort ) II . To assess peripheral blood biomarkers pharmacokinetics homogenous population . ( Expansion cohort ) III . To determine whether treatment associate myeloid cell leukemia-1 ( Mcl-1 ) regulation hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . ( Expansion cohort ) IV . To assess preliminary fashion whether pretreatment tumor cell level Mcl-1 predict response regimen serial biopsy . ( Expansion cohort ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study navitoclax . Patients receive navitoclax orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 ( day 1-28 course 1 ) sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 ( day 8-28 course 1 ) . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
