	<detailed_description>In previous report , many predictor early deterioration ischemic stroke propose study , yet result remain controversial . For example , several study perform ascertain whether cerebral systemic cause major determinant stroke deterioration . The finding , however , inconsistent . Measures overall status stroke severity ( low initial Canadian Stroke Severity score , low initial National Institutes Health Stroke Scale score , early CT finding stroke severity , change cerebral blood flow affect ischemic penumbra measure positron emission tomography single photon emission compute tomography image show predict early deterioration . Laboratory test coagulation marker ( fibrinogen , D-dimers ) , inflammatory marker ( increase interleukin-6 , decrease interleukin-10 ) , serum glucose admission , hematocrit physiological parameter , blood pressure ( elevate decrease ) , body temperature identify predictor early deterioration . In addition , patient medical history ( diabetes mellitus , atherosclerosis , chronic heart disease ) also associate early stroke deterioration . These differ finding may due variation study design , patient population , selection exclusion criterion , criterion use define early deterioration . A complication try determine predictor early deterioration stroke different stroke subtypes may manifest differently term clinical change deterioration . In aforementioned study , attempt make differentiate among stroke subtypes . While others show proposed marker statistically significant certain stroke subtypes . A predictor early deterioration equally applicable stroke subtypes need . The investigator study laboratory measurement previously identify risk factor identify factor predictor early deterioration follow stroke . A prospective observational study 196 patient first-time acute ischemic stroke perform . Following multivariate analysis , Bun/Cr &gt; 15 independent predictor SIE . These patient 3.41-fold likely SIE ( P=0.008 ) . The elevated Bun/Cr ratio indicate relative dehydration patient . Monitoring hydration status would also appear critical patient . Being able accurately identify patient risk early deterioration follow stroke allow design clinical trial stroke intervention target patient SIE . The investigator need test confirm maintenance proper hydration improve outcome patient Bun/Cr ratio high 15 .</detailed_description>
