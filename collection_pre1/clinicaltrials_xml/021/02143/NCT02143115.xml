	<detailed_description>The goal study compare , clinically cost-effectiveness perspective , virtual CT-C ( CT-Colonography ) standard CT scan optical colonoscopy ( OC ) . Virtual colonoscopy combination radiologic evaluation abdomen pelvis intra-colonic imaging . Previous research support concept CT-C may effective substitute current OC address limit compliance surveillance CRC survivor . Post-operative CRC surveillance strategy effective , depend upon patient compliance less desire . Improved adherence link great cost-effectiveness well well clinical outcome . CT-C posse potential advantage : convenience single test , less risk , possibly patient preference lower total cost . Costs would reduce direct ( provision few optical colonoscopy ) indirect mean ( reduction time lose work patient chaperone , etc. ) . When extrapolate across roughly 200,000 OCs perform annually US indication reduce utilization even 50 % high unit cost procedure like OC would yield substantial saving without reduction clinical quality .</detailed_description>
