	<brief_summary>Background : - A protein call translocator protein may play role brain inflammation . Sometimes present high level lung brain . Researchers want see drug call [ 11C ] ER176 provide image protein brain . Objective : - To test ability drug image protein , test distribute body . Eligibility : - Healthy adult age 18 . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . - Participants PET scan brain use [ 11C ] ER176 . It inject intravenous tube 1-2 arm vein . A tube may also put artery wrist elbow . Some participant also lung scan . - For PET , participant lie bed slide doughnut-shaped scanner . A plastic mask mold face head . They may wrap restrain sheet . The scan last 120 minute . Blood may take scan . - Blood urine take scan . - During another visit , participant MRI scan brain . Participants lie table slide metal cylinder . A strong magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . The scanner make loud knock noise . Participants give earplug . - Some participant whole-body PET scan use [ 11C ] ER176 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Translocator protein 18 kDa ( TSPO ) highly express activate microglia reactive astrocyte brain , may , thereby , useful biomarker neuroinflammation . We develop [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 positron emission tomographic ( PET ) radioligand bind TSPO measure density . Although [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 high vivo specific signal , sensitive high low affinity state TSPO , cause rs6971 single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) fourth exon TSPO gene result nonconservative alanine-to-threonine substitution position 147 encode TSPO protein . This co-dominant mutation yield three genetic group : HH , HL , LL , H high-affinity form L low affinity form . The frequency L allele approximately 30 % ; thus , frequency LL homozygote approximately 9 % . The affinity PBR28 H L form differs 50 fold ; thus , LL carrier provide measureable signal brain [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 . We recently develop new TSPO ligand ER176 , affinity differs 1.2 fold therefore LL carrier provide measureable brain uptake . The purpose study assess potential [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 image TSPO brain , characterize bind sensitivity lung healthy subject three genetic group , whole-body image biodistribution estimation radiation dosimetry human . The present protocol use new PET ligand [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 1 ) perform initial whole-body scan [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 injection single healthy volunteer confirm wide-spread distribution radioactivity different body organ ( Phase 0 ) ; 2 ) perform kinetic brain scan healthy volunteer 3 different genotype , half volunteer undergo lung scan session ( Phase 1 ) , ; 3 ) perform whole-body image healthy volunteer ( Phase 2 ) . This study assess relative robustness absolute quantitation TSPO brain healthy subject , use arterial input function pharmacokinetic modeling . In addition , lung image provide vivo bind sensitivity [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 TSPO genotype . Furthermore , whole-body imaging would estimate radiation-absorbed dos future use [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 clinical study . Study Population We select 36 healthy adult female male volunteer ( age 18 old ) 3 different TSPO genotype brain imaging , 11 additional healthy volunteer whole body dosimetry analysis . Design For absolute quantification TSPO , 36 healthy control ( 12 three TSPO genotype ) brain PET image use [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 subject arterial line brain MRI scan . In half subject genotype group , lung scan session . For radiation dosimetry [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 , 11 subject whole-body PET imaging . These subject arterial line MRI scan . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure : ( ) To assess absolute quantitation TSPO [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 , determine identifiability time stability distribution volume brain calculate compartmental modeling . The difference mean distribution volume among subject different genotype would use evaluate genotype sensitivity [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 . ( b ) To assess whole-body biodistribution dosimetry [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 use organ time-activity curve . As secondary outcome measure , examine effect polymorphism [ ( 11 ) C ] ER176 bind lung lung much high density TSPO may effective show whether ER176 sensitive SNP .</detailed_description>
