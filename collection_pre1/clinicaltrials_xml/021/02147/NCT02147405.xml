	<brief_summary>Background : - Sometimes people HIV , virus cause AIDS , new worsen symptom soon start HIV medication . Often symptoms cause immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) . Researchers want study people develop IRIS best prevent treat . Objectives : - To learn cause effect IRIS , best manage . Eligibility : - Adults 18 old HIV low CD4 count , , start HIV medicine ; already take HIV medicine symptom thought relate IRIS . Design : - Participants ART screen blood test CD4 count , HIV viral load genetic testing . - After screen blood test start HIV medicines. , participant return 1 visit following : &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - review medical history &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - physical eye exam &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - blood , urine , tuberculosis ( TB ) test &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - electrocardiogram ( EKG ) &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - chest x-ray - apheresis : blood draw procedure blood remove vein , white blood cell separate collect , rest blood return person use another vein - - PET scan - procedure small amount radioactive material inject vein . The participant lie table slide scanner take image body . &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - lymph node biopsy &lt; TAB &gt; &lt; TAB &gt; - stool collection swab - After completion , HIV medicine start . - Follow-up visit 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 week start ART , every 12 week . Some test may repeat . - Participants already HIV medicine may IRIS screen 4 week time period see really experience IRIS . The screening process include item list . Follow-up visit Weeks , 4 , 8 , 12 every 12 week . - The study last 1 year group may extend 2 year ( 3 additional appointment ) participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) HIV infection represent paradoxical , frequently inflammatory , immune response initiation antiretroviral ( ART ) therapy . The immunopathogenesis IRIS remain elusive partially due lack tissue sample lack detailed screening , include imaging , subclinical opportunistic infection many study . Most pathogenesis study date perform peripheral blood notable exception cryptococcal IRIS study cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sample obtain evaluate . This 2-arm natural history study intend evaluate incidence , predictor pathogenic mechanism IRIS HIV-1 infect adult ( age &gt; 18 year ) . A ART Naive arm enroll 100 patient ART-naive CD4+ T cell count &lt; 100 cells/mm ( 3 ) . These participant initiate ART accord clinical standard care . Any opportunistic infection ( OIs ) AIDS-defining illness identify prior , screen point study , also treat accord standard care . The IRIS arm enroll 20 participant ART-treated meet criterion suspicious IRIS ( Appendix D ) , CD4+ T cell count . The ART Naive arm follow 48 week , optional extension week 96 . The IRIS arm follow 48 week enrollment IRIS event confirm , also optional extension week 96 . In arm , subject must adequate venous access undergo collection whole blood phlebotomy , leukapheresis , lymph node biopsy , fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET/CT ) designate study visit .</detailed_description>

In event estimate reversible inability consent , patient may enroll via legally authorize representative ( DPA ) ability assign DPA . For participant , baseline lymph node biopsy perform however week 48 lymph node biopsy may perform participant regains capacity consent prior time . IRIS ARM INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Documentation HIV1 infection . Results outside facility accept enrollment . 2 . Meet criterion suspicious IRIS ( Must meet 4/5 follow criterion ) : I. Initiation ( reintroduction change ) antiretroviral therapy/regimen II . Evidence : 1. increase CD4+ cell count define great equal 50cell/mm ( 3 ) great equal 2 fold rise CD4+ cell count , and/or 2. decrease HIV1 viral load great equal 0.5 log10 III . Symptoms and/or sign consistent infectious/inflammatory condition . IV . Theses symptom and/or sign explain newly acquire infection , expect clinical course previously recognize infectious agent , side effect antiretroviral therapy . V. The infectious/inflammatory condition must attributable specific pathogen condition . *Criteria IV V may meet suspected IRIS definition . 3 . Residence within wide Washington D.C. area ( within 100mile radius NIH Bethesda campus ) . **Participants outside 100 mile radius may enrol case case basis diagnose manage IRIS . 4 .
