	<brief_summary>This study intend build grow body literature show blood flow abnormality patient Becker muscular dystrophy . The investigator ' laboratory recently show blood flow abnormality could correct single oral dose drug Tadalafil ( also know Cialis ) . The investigator wish replicate excite result use common nitric oxide donor ( sodium nitrate ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There 2 phase research project : ( 1 ) initial baseline study confirm blood flow abnormality Becker muscular dystrophy , ( 2 ) subsequent brief treatment trial . There also 3 optional study protocol : ( A ) dose-escalation trial , ( B ) placebo trial , ( C ) increase exercise intensity trial . The baseline study involve intake history , physical examination , phlebotomy blood chemistry DNA follow non-invasive forearm blood flow study ( Near Infrared Spectroscopy , Doppler Ultrasound ) brief bout handgrip exercise ( approximately 3-5 hour complete ) . Blood flow study perform subject 's low body enclose airtight chamber . Blood flow oxygen delivery forearm muscle measure application lower body negative pressure rest handgrip exercise . Lower body negative pressure simulate blood flow change normally occur person sits lie . The result baseline study determine patient meet preset eligibility criterion participate medication phase study . These criterion include ( 1 ) normal kidney liver function test normal BNP level ( latter exclude heart failure ) , ( 2 ) abnormal blood flow response handgrip exercise . Eligible patient ask repeat laboratory procedure subsequent study day receive single dose sodium nitrate . Eligible patient also offer option repeat laboratory procedure three subsequent study visit , upon : ( A ) dose sodium nitrate increase , ( B ) placebo ingest , and/or ( C ) level exercise increase . The investigator plan enroll 20 adult men Becker muscular dystrophy .</detailed_description>
