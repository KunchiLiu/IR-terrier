	<brief_summary>The purpose study look effect drug Ranolazine compare Placebo symptom chest pain chest tightness ( know angina ) , exercise endurance ability , change blood flow small artery heart ( know coronary microvascular function ) patient significant blockage major heart artery . Ranolazine drug already approve FDA angina , may particularly effective people disease tiny heart vessel ( know coronary microvascular disease ) . This trial aim enroll 50 patient angina undergo baseline bicycle exercise test monitor heart 's electrical activity oxygen consumption ( know cardiopulmonary exercise test ) coronary angiogram ( take picture heart arteries small hollow tube place wrist groin ) . If severe blockage main artery find test coronary microvascular function perform . Subsequently , participant randomize 50/50 either Ranolazine Placebo . After take study drug 12 week , repeat cardiopulmonary exercise test coronary angiogram test microvascular function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Heart disease common cause death world . Most understanding heart disease involve large heart artery ( epicardial artery ) ; however , disease small heart artery ( coronary microvasculature ) likely precede development epicardial disease represent `` base iceberg '' cardiovascular disease . Yet , understand dysfunctional microvasculature lead reduce blood flow , symptoms adverse outcome . Coronary microvascular disease result combination structural functional abnormality , important reliable diagnostic tool rely solely image . The gold-standard testing involve hemodynamic ( blood circulation ) measurements coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) hyperemic microcirculatory resistance ( HMR ) take place cardiac catheterization laboratory . Ranolazine relatively new U.S Food Drug Administration-approved medicine help angina ( chest pain ) . There publication effect Ranolazine HMR .</detailed_description>
