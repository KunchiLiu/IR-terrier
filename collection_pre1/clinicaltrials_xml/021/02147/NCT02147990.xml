	<brief_title>TIGER-2 : A Phase 2 , Open-label , Multicenter , Safety Efficacy Study Oral CO-1686 2nd Line EGFR-directed TKI Patients With Mutant EGFR Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , single arm , open-label , dual cohort , multicenter study evaluate safety efficacy rociletinib administer orally patient previously treat mutant EGFR NSCLC . Patients enrol 2 cohort . Cohort A enroll approximately 125 eligible patient centrally confirm T790M-positive . Cohort B continuation study enroll approximately 100 eligible patient either centrally confirm T790M-positive T790M-negative . All patient ( Cohort A B ) experience disease progression treatment first single-agent EGFR-directed TKI ( EGFR-TKI ) advanced/metastatic NSCLC . One line chemotherapy prior EGFR-TKI treatment permissible . The study ( Cohorts A B ) consist screen phase establish study eligibility document baseline measurement , open-label treatment phase , patient receive rociletinib ascertain safety efficacy disease progression define RECIST Version 1.1 , clinical tumor progression , unacceptable toxicity assess investigator . For patient clinical progression , radiographic assessment perform document evidence radiographic progression .</detailed_description>
