	<brief_summary>This prospective randomized control trial examine efficacy reduce number chest tube use postoperative cardiac surgery patient . Typically use three chest tube - two mediastinum one pleural space , open . The investigator propose removal pleural tube impact rate clinically significant pleural effusion post cardiac surgery . Patients randomize two group - one receive standard three chest tube ( standard ) , receive mediastinal drain ( experimental ) . The primary outcome rate post-operative pleural effusion determine defined intervention , include insertion chest tube , thoracentesis , return operate room primary evacuation pleural effusion hemothorax . Secondary outcome include length hospital stay , length mechanical ventilation , postoperative respiratory status , presence/size pleural effusion , well readmission pleural effusion .</brief_summary>
