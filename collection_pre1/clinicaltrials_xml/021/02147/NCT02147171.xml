	<brief_summary>Normal age affect vision result preretinal retinal change . Photoreceptors , light sensitive cell retina , degenerate rod ( responsible night vision ) susceptible damage increase age . Rod loss lead poor vision dark increase risk accident amongst elderly . Macular pigment ( locate photoreceptors ) think protect retina reduce risk age relate change . Dark adaptation , mediate rod , slow age , also reduce AMD ( age-related macular degeneration ) . Recent evidence suggest lutein ( main component macular pigment ) supplementation improve dark adaptation deficit AMD subject . Research effect lutein normal human previously conduct . Since old population increase , aim firstly establish extent night vision loss ( use dark adaptometry ) secondly examine possibility slow reverse loss lutein supplementation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It believe macular pigment protects retina photooxidative damage lead agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) . It also hypothesize enhance visual performance normal human eye . Much research lutein supplementation center around AMD subject . AMD result agerelated retinal photoreceptor dysfunction could hypothetically prevent slow early supplementation . To knowledge , effect lutein normal ageing , study previously . Macular pigment compose lutein zeaxanthin . These compound absorb blue light therefore protect retinal photoreceptors . They also possess powerful antioxidant property therefore help maintain integrity macular region . With increase age , visual performance worsens result preretinal retinal change photoreceptor degeneration . Rods ( responsible night vision ) highly susceptible degeneration normal age eye AMD . Older subject often complain reduced vision dark contribute increase risk road traffic accident fall . Since old population rapidly grow , vital study mechanic photoreceptor degeneration possible beneficial effect supplementation retinal carotenoid , particularly lutein . The supplement use study commercially available Visionace Plus ( detail attach ) . The manufacturer Visionace Plus Vitabiotics . The placebo soya-based , also manufacture Vitabiotics .</detailed_description>
