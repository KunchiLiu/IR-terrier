	<brief_summary>The National Register Nephrology 2007 show , similarly European data , problem high mortality rate among Polish dialysis patient . The main reason death among chronically dialysis patient cardio - vascular system diseases . According `` The Report Condition Renal Replacement Therapy Poland 2007 '' , diseases cause 53 % death Poland . The patient chronic kidney disease ( PChN ) particularly risk cardio - vascular complication . These complication occur average 30 time often whole population , among young dialysis people , complication occur 300 time often . In development cardio - vascular complication polyunsaturated Omega-3 acid ( especially eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA docosahexaenoic acid - DHA ) take special position . The reaction polyunsaturated Omega-3 acid cardiovascular system result enrichment phospholipid cell membrane within EPA DHA . It note impact dependent type acid dose . Docosahexaenoic acid reacts lipid lipoprotein , blood pressure , heart rate , amount glucose , eicosapentaenoic acid responsible antiplatelet effect . This project aim define elaborate connection Omega-3 acid , cardiovascular complication , influence function cardiovascular system , moreover , good understanding effect therapeutic pharmacological therapy patient different stage chronic kidney disease . Carrying project good start shape international project area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The survey cover 90 patient chronic kidney disease different stage disease ( I-III ) 30 healthy subject comparison group . At begin end observation period , besides clinical test , test carry : echocardiography , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) . Blood collect laboratory test : lipid profile , uric acid , C reactive protein ( CRP ) , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , creatinine , morphology , calcium ( Ca ) , phosphorus ( P ) , Ca x P , ionogram , xanthine oxidase , monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MPC1 ) , Omega-3 acid , resolvin protectins - metabolites Omega-3 acid , creatinine excretion , MPC1 excretion excretion uric acid . The patient treat Omega-3 acid Gold Omega 3 preparation ( 2x1 capsule 1 capsule = 1000 mg ) 6 month .</detailed_description>
