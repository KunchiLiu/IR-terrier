	<brief_summary>- Hypertension one leading risk factor influence morbidity mortality . There need non-pharmacological management . Music known reduce anxiety hold promise non-pharmacological management hypertension owe low cost , ease administration safety . The efficacy music reduce blood pressure ( BP ) establish . Besides inconsistent finding , early study use music frequently inconclusive small sample size . The study examine biomarkers hypertension . - The purpose study evaluate effect Indian Instrumental music pre-hypertensives stage 1 hypertensive subject . Non-pharmacological intervention improve quality life hypertensive music may serve adjunct therapy along standard management hypertensive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Arterial hypertension important risk factor disease like myocardial infarction stroke lead increase morbidity mortality . Lifestyle modification often recommend part treatment mild hypertension , efficacy adjunct therapy unclear . Weight loss salt restriction effective modality , require major change dietary habit , difficult patient compliance . A number therapeutic modality aim reduce stress encourage relaxation evaluate treatment hypertension . Various method like autogenic training , cognitive therapy , behavioral therapy , Meditation , Guided imagery , biofeedback , progressive muscle relaxation , breathe exercise , yoga previously study reduce hypertension . Music long know reduce anxiety , minimize need sedative , make patient feel ease . Music therapy different music medicine . Music therapist individualize intervention accord patient 's need . Patients actively get engage music making . However , music medicine , subject listen pre-recorded music perceive benefit . A number research study conduct determine effect music variety clinical condition . Effect music stress reduction document physiological ( e.g . heart rate , blood pressure ) , neurological ( e.g . EEG reading ) psychological domain . In addition , effect music intervention document range medical , surgical , oncology , pediatric patient . In one study hypertensive individual , significant decrease systolic ( 15.9 mm Hg reduction ) diastolic BP ( 9 mm Hg ) weekly music therapy session duration 12 week . The control group show significant change ( Márquez-Celedonio , 2009 ) . Among hypertensive , significant reduction BP use device guide user towards slow regular breathe use musical sound pattern . The device use 10 minute daily home 8 week . The control group study give walkman patient listen quiet music . Treatment device reduce systolic BP , diastolic BP Mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) 15.2,10.0 11.7 mm Hg respectively , compare 11.3 , 5.6 7.5 mm Hg Walkman ( Schein , 2001 ) . Another study evaluate short long-term effect audio relaxation program BP reduction older adult . The subject listen 12-minute audio relaxation program . The reduction systolic diastolic BP statistically clinically significant ( Tang , 1996 ) . There study examine effect music hormone level particular relevance heart disease , include adrenaline noradrenaline concentration level stress hormone deleterious cardiac functioning . Further , best knowledge , study do among prehypertensives use music intervention . Thus propose study whether blood pressure among prehypertensives stage 1 hypertensive decrease music intervention . In order know mechanism underlying reduction , propose study biomarkers ( indicate function vascular endothelium , stress hormone , oxidative stress ) responsible causation hypertension autonomic function . A good understanding alteration biomarkers help u explain mechanism action validate music intervention tool non-pharmacological management hypertension .</detailed_description>
