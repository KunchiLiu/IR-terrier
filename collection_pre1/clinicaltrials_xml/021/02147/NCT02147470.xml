	<brief_summary>Hepatorenal syndrome ( HRS ) common cause acute kidney injury ( AKI ) cirrhotic patient one month survival rate 50 % 3 month survival rate 20 % . The lead theory behind HRS selective vasoconstriction renal vasculature set decreased systemic vascular resistance . Patients liver cirrhosis suffer large degree third space form peripheral edema ascites . In addition treatment multiple drug , include diuretic put patient higher risk prerenal AKI ischemic acute tubular necrosis ( ATN ) . AKI occur due HRS , prerenal AKI ischemic nephrotoxic ATN different pathophysiologic mechanism treat differently significantly different outcome . While renal perfusion expect reduced HRS prerenal AKI , normal increase ATN . Prerenal AKI favorable prognosis among pathology treatment simply consist volume expansion blood , albumin , crystalloids colloid . In clinical practice vasoactive agent midodrine octreotide used increase tone splanchnic vessel improve renal perfusion . These intervention would affect renal function case ATN . Unfortunately , diagnostic criterion propose International Club Ascites ( ICA ) HRS specific always exclude patient form acute kidney injury . Therefore , availability simple diagnostic tool measurement renal blood flow ( RBF ) bedside would great value management case cirrhosis liver present acute reduction kidney function . However , currently , practical simple tool available purpose . Contrast enhance ultrasonography ( CEU ) involve intravenous injection gas-filled microbubbles enhance ultrasound image organ mainly assess tissue vascularity blood flow . We others use CEU ass change RBF response physiologic stimuli therapeutic intervention . Here propose prospective , pilot diagnostic study validate use CEU , assess RBF cirrhotic patient AKI , assess utility CEU differentiate cause AKI cirrhotic patient . Our hypothesis CEU show arteriolar vasoconstriction decrease blood flow renal cortex patient HRS would change response volume expansion . On contrary , patient prerenal AKI reduce RBF increase volume expansion . Finally , ATN reduce RBF baseline . We plan enroll 25 patient liver cirrhosis acute kidney injury admit University Virginia hospital study . CEU perform subject measure baseline RBF . CEU repeat subject within 24 hour volume expansion least 1gm/kg albumin ( 100 gm/day ) ass potential change . Hourly urine output serum creatinine monitor potential renal response volume expansion part clinical care . For subgroup subject receive treatment combination therapy albumin , midodrine , octreotide ( AMO ) RBF assessment CEU repeat least 48 hour receive combination . Renal response assess monitoring urine output serum creatinine monitor part clinical care . All subject measurement fractional excretion sodium ( FENa ) urea ( FEUrea ) urine microscopy part routine clinical care ( work AKI ) . The result test response volume expansion use categorize subject three category AKI ( HRS , prerenal AKI , ATN ) . Correlations RBF change different therapeutic intervention renal diagnosis test study .</brief_summary>
