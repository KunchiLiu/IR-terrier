	<brief_summary>We propose conduct pilot study examine utility mechanism Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention reduce alcohol consumption , relapse rate , physiological arousal stress adult 21 year age old meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criterion alcohol dependence within past year abstain drinking last thirty day . MBRP design improve one 's ability self-regulate emotion , thought physical state , thus reduce need alleviate associate discomfort substance use . Participants assign intervention group receive 8-week training course MBRP period nine week ; participant assign Treatment As Usual ( TAU ) group continue treatment usual , include utilizing effective strategy refrain alcohol use . All participant assess pretreatment severity psychological abuse/trauma well pre posttreatment psychosocial functioning ( e.g. , alcohol consumption , symptom depression anxiety , emotion regulation/coping ) . The outcome treatment evaluate use ) Timeline Followback drinking data b ) self-report rating acquisition MBRP skill ( e.g. , state/trait mindfulness , acceptance awareness , perceive stress ) depressive anxiety symptom severity . We hypothesize participant receive MBRP training demonstrate great acceptance awareness , reduce craving , low likelihood relapse participant TAU group . It also expect MBRP participant demonstrate great improvement psychological measure depression , anxiety , emotion regulation cop , show less perceived stress physiological arousal stress compare TAU participant . Finally , little known type individual likely benefit MBRP . Thus , secondary analysis help clarify MBRP may effective .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stress exposure increase psychological physiological arousal lead negative health outcome . An impaired ability self-regulate response stress contribute development alcohol use disorder relapse . Mindfulness , state present-focused attention awareness , systematically learn meditative practice improve self-regulation emotional , physiological behavioral response stress . Mindfulness meditation facilitate balance mind body thereby increase one 's ability respond proactively effectively daily event . Research evidence suggest strong association mindfulness positive indicator well-being include reduction fear , anxiety , anger , good physiological recovery stress . Given importance self-regulation development progression alcohol use disorder relapse , new approach substance use treatment , Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention ( MBRP ) , develop . Traditionally , MBRP eight-week outpatient treatment program , integrate core aspect Relapse Prevention ( RP ) practice practice adapt Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy . The mindfulness practice MBRP design increase acceptance tolerance negative emotion , thought physical state thus reduce need alleviate associate discomfort substance use . MBRP also focus increase awareness trigger develop effective coping behavior high-risk situation . Among adult substance use disorder , MBRP find lead significantly low rate substance use , great decrease craving great increase acceptance act awareness treatment usual . MBRP also find facilitate effective cop self-regulation negative emotion early abstinence . While research indicate MBRP effective reduce substance use relapse , preliminary research examine influence MBRP physiological mechanism involve emotion regulation exposure stress . Examining physiological mechanism essential central autonomic nervous system work together coordinate self-regulation attention , cognition emotion stressful cue encounter , substance dependent individual expose stressful and/or substance relate stimulus . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) generally see index emotion regulation . High frequency HRV reflect parasympathetic activation autonomic nervous system body 's ability exert cognitive control attention emotional responding . Higher level HRV associate great emotional behavioral flexibility , tend associate well mental physical health outcome . In contrast , low level HRV associate wide range medical psychiatric disorder , include acute chronic alcohol ingestion , anxiety depression . Among alcohol dependent individual , mindfulness training find increase HRV lower subjective level psychological distress response stressful cue short-term . The propose study first examine long-term effect MBRP HRV self-reported psychological/behavioral functioning . The result provide good understanding interplay psychological physical mechanism involve relapse help determine whether MBRP last psychological physiological benefit . In word , assess psychological physiological effect MBRP provide accurate comprehensive understanding mindfulness aid promote self-regulation relapse prevention . Finally , little known type individual likely benefit MBRP . It necessary examine individual characteristic ( i.e. , baseline level HRV , trait mindfulness , substance use , anxiety , depression ) determine characteristic associate positive treatment outcome short long-term . This knowledge enable efficient effective delivery MBRP treatment .</detailed_description>
