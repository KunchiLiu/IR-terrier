	<brief_summary>Heart failure major health concern lead cause hospitalization among elderly Americans . Currently 5.7 million Americans estimate heart failure estimate direct indirect cost treat heart failure approximately $ 37.2 billion . Approximately 40 % diagnosed heart failure heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFPEF ) . These individual significant restriction ability carry activity daily live . Exercise training establish adjuvant therapy heart failure . Although exercise training guideline treatment heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HFREF ) well establish , consensus exercise guideline exist management HFPEF . Aerobic cardiovascular adaptation generally great high-intensity exercise training ; interval-type exercise facilitate type training allow rest period make possible patient heart failure perform short ( e.g. , 1-4 minute ) work period intensity higher would possible continuous exercise . High-intensity aerobic interval training present unique , yet untested , therapeutic modality exercise training patient heart failure preserve ejection fraction . Pilot test warrant , result may important implication reduce cardiovascular risk , increase short- long-term quality life survival , reduce healthcare cost patient population . The investigator primary specific aim determine efficacy novel , high-intensity aerobic interval exercise training program improve VO2peak ( peak oxygen uptake ) , endothelial function , arterial stiffness patient HFPEF . The investigator secondary aim determine whether vascular change correlate change VO2peak .</brief_summary>
