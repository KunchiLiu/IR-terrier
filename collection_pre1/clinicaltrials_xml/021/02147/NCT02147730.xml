	<brief_summary>Regional anesthesia technique , administration local anesthetic neuraxial peripheral route play central role modern anesthesia particular control postoperative pain . There many review meta-analyzes suggest good pain control , specifically loco regional analgesia , may improve outcome patient undergoing surgery . The control acute post-operative pain challenge pay anesthesiologist , still much understood relation persistent post-surgical pain ( PPP ) , degree influence regional anesthesia play complete long-term functional recovery patient . From pathophysiological perspective precise definition mechanism risk factor determine onset persistent pain surgery , , general , seem related malfunction mechanism secondary hyperalgesia . Regional anesthesia could play key role , main determinant chronic pain acute post-operative pain . The technique regional anesthesia exert powerful block peripheral level , potentially prevent progression central pain persistence stimuli reach central nervous system . In addition , surgery , technique reduce metabolic alteration trigger mechanisms local systemic pro-inflammatory mediator ' release . Few perspective study exist influence regional anesthesia long-term outcome persistent pain surgery . The objective investigator study assess prospective fashion role regional anesthesia/analgesia technique prevent ( ) persistence pain occurrence surgical intervention mostly associate pain persistence , understand regional anesthesia provide advantage post-surgical outcome .</brief_summary>
