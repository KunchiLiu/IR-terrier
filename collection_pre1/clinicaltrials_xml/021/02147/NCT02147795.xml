	<detailed_description>Background : The transfusion allogeneic red blood cell unit might associate increased morbidity mortality due infectious , immunological , pulmonary thromboembolic complication . However , transfusion practice currently vary significantly hospital even physicians Patient Blood Management program implement nationwide Germany yet . Patient Blood Management ( PBM ) concepts aim identify optimize patient risk allogeneic blood transfusion , promote blood-sparing technique restrictive transfusion practice . A rational use red blood cell concentrate safe clinical transfusion practice mandatory . The purpose German PBM network evaluate safety standardize , evidence-based Patient Blood management concept . Study Design Methods : This epidemiological study follow-up study already carry four German university hospital . This new prospective , multi-centre trial comprises approximately 20 different hospital vary size level patient care . A patient-centred , evidence-based Patient Blood Management program enrol hospital reform care adult patient undergo type surgery . This PBM program include follow three main pillar : 1 ) preoperative optimization hemoglobin level high-risk patient anaemia , 2 ) standardization transfusion practice transfusion trigger accord evidence-based guideline 3 ) alternative transfusion allogeneic RBC concentrate blood-sparing technique ( like routine use cell saver system , point-of-care diagnostics , optimize coagulation management , restrictive blood sample ) .</detailed_description>
