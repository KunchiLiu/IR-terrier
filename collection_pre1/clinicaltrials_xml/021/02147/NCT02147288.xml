	<brief_summary>The specific aim study improve post-operative wound care morbidly-obese body-contouring patient population follow massive weight loss undergo either panniculectomy formal abdominoplasty , patient undergo complex abdominal wall reconstruction ( i.e . ventral hernia repair ) breast reconstruction acellular dermal matrix , well patient undergo regular lipo-abdominoplasty comparing effectiveness standard closed-suction drain versus immediate application continuous negative pressure via NPWT ( negative pressure wound therapy ) device attach non-compressible drain . Additionally , aim demonstrate increase cost-effectiveness quality life patient use NPWT wound care apparatus . Hypothesis 1 Continuous negative pressure device decrease incidence wind complication comparison conventional closed suction drain use patient massive weight loss undergo body-contouring procedure ( panniculectomies alone formal abdominoplasty ) , patient undergo VHR breast reconstruction acellular dermal matrix , well undergo regular lipo-abdominoplasty . Hypothesis 2 Although initially costly traditional closed suction drain , use continuous negative pressure device long-term result lower total health care cost above-stated patient population due decrease need additional procedure and/or clinical management , include surgical intervention , hospital admission , administration antibiotic , multiple follow-up office visit , chronic wound care . Hypothesis 3 Better quality life associate use continuous negative pressure device compare closed suction drain patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In collaboration Yale Bariatric Surgery Program General Surgery Department , patient identify 18-years-of-age old seek body-contouring procedure ( include panniculectomy abdominoplasty ) follow massive weight loss patient need complex abdominal wall reconstruction ( i.e . ventral hernia repair ) breast reconstruction necessitate use acellular dermal matrix . For timeframe outline protocol , Section Plastic Surgery Yale performs surgery excess required number need study , ensure timely completion . Exclusion criterion include FDA-identified contraindication use continuous negative pressure suction device , follow : - presence necrotic tissue - untreated osteomyelitis - malignancy ( except terminal patient quality life issue ) - untreated malnutrition - use exposed artery , vein , organ - use non-enteric unexplored fistula Special precaution take use NPWT device patient anticoagulant , exhibit otherwise difficult hemostasis , non-adherent patient . Following detailed explanation study design well associate risk benefit may incur potential test group , patient agree participate study ( via inform consent ) categorize characteristic include past medical history , past surgical history , social history , pre- post-bariatric surgery total weight loss BMI randomize either control ( standard close suction drain ) experimental ( continuous negative pressure via NPWT device ) arm group , depend procedure perform , follow : 1 . 30 total patient undergo panniculectomy alone follow massive weight loss 2 . 30 total patient undergo formal abdominoplasty ( include undermine skin flap , rectus fascia plication liposuction ) follow massive weight loss 3 . 30 total non-massive weight loss patient undergo formal lipo-abdominoplasty 4 . 30 total patient undergo ventral hernia repair use acellular dermal matrix 5 . 30 total patient undergo bilateral breast reconstruction use acellular dermal matrix 30 breast randomize conventional closed suction ( one breast leave vs right ) 30 breast randomize continuous negative pressure device ( =60 breast total ) The control subject arm procedure group outfit 2 standard close suction Jackson-Pratt ( JP ) drain period 4 week ( unless otherwise specify principle investigator point follow-up ) , inpatient home . The experimental subject arm procedure group outfit 2 non-compressible Blake drain attach continuous suction via NPWT device period 4 week ( unless otherwise specify principle investigator point follow-up ) , inpatient home . In breast reconstruction group internal control via 30 breast drain conventionally patient . To achieve good control variable , total length incision area skin- undermining along midline also measure documented massive weight loss patient group : 1. exactly distinguish formal abdominoplasty panniculectomy patient 2. evaluate extent skin-undermining contribute factor seroma-formation compare patient ' intrinsic factor . All patient group 1 wear compression girdle start post-operative day # 1 ; patient group 2 3 start wear compression girdle post-operative day # 7 ( minimize risk central skin flap necrosis ) ; patient group 4 start wear regular abdominal binder post-operative day # 1 . The amount tumescent solution well amount lipo-aspirate record patient group 2 &amp; 3 . The following chart provide follow-up lab study clinic visit : Wound-Healing Research Study Schedule Logistics Post-Op Follow-up Activities *Duration Week 1 Formal Outpatient Clinic Visit 30 minute Follow-Up Blood Labs # 1 15 minute Quality Life Survey # 1 30 minute Week 2 Formal Outpatient Clinic Visit 30 minute Follow-up Blood Labs # 2 15 minute Ultrasound Examination # 1 15-30 minute Week 3 Ultrasound Examination # 2 15-30 minute ( No formal clinic visit ) Week 4 Formal Outpatient Clinic Visit 30 minute Quality Life Survey # 4 30 minute Week 8 Formal Outpatient Clinic Visit 30 minute *All visit duration time approximate . Per routine post-operative protocol , patient see clinic week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , need clinically . Ultrasounds perform research purpose 2nd 4th week visit , diagnostically event complication arise point post-operative period . QALY survey perform 1st 4th week post-operative clinic visit . Together standard pre-operative blood work , ( i.e. , complete blood count ( CBC ) , basic electrolyte panel , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) /prothrombin time test ( PT ) /partial thromboplastin test ( PTT ) ) , also obtain albumin , pre-albumin total protein level patient post operative day ( PODs ) # 7 # 14 . Outcomes measure follow : - Total amount fluid drainage compare two system 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 week ( long drain remain place ) - Analysis complication rate include incidence infection require antibiotic , wound dehiscence , need seroma drainage and/or surgical revision . - Quantification seroma formation ultrasound examination 5 region abdominal wall : epigastrium ( EPI ) , umbilical ( UMB ) , hypogastrium ( HYPO ) , right iliac fossa ( RIF ) leave iliac fossa ( LIF ) ] , two postoperative period : ( P1 ) , postoperative day # 11 # 14 , ( P2 ) , postoperative day # 18 # 21 describe DiMartino et al [ 20 ] , well ultrasound superior , medial , lateral inferior portion reconstruct breast . Subjects include control ( standard close suction drain ) experimental arm ( NPWT device ) procedure group experience risk subject privacy , discomfort , inconvenience associate participate research project would otherwise experience use standard close suction drain currently use post-operative wound care . These standard risk , discomfort , inconvenience include potential bleeding drain site , infection drain site , requirement change collection vessel full , pain . The post-operative ultrasound evaluation also non-invasive . It evaluation often perform patient post-operative period ass subcutaneous fluid collection . The cost-effectiveness approach post-surgical drain placement design assess via track patient health care cost associate specific surgical procedure perform , cost associate immediate post-surgical care , follow-up care incur prolonged post-operative period designate study design . The relevant cost compare control experimental group arm study cost-effectiveness ratio calculate use objective , validated quality life assessment . Quality life assess via incremental cost-effectiveness ratio , namely repeatedly validate quality adjust life year ( QALY ) metric achieve patient surveys/interviews . The dynamic health assessment survey ( DYNHA SF-36 ) use evaluate patient health outcome . The DYNHA SF-36 Health Survey computerize adaptive testing ( CAT ) version industry standard , fixed-length Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) translate make available use many country language-based cohort [ 21 ] . The SF-36 focus assess functional health well-being , measure eight health domain , include physical functioning , bodily pain , ability engage work leisure activity , psychological distress , vitality , emotional health order accurately evaluate individual 's physical mental status throughout recovery period . The advantage dynamic health assessment include brevity without sacrifice accuracy , focus parameter affect chronic health condition , reliable outcome monitor individual , low data collection cost , real-time result built-in interpretation scoring . Regarding breast reconstruction group , feel employ two different technique ( i.e . continuous v intermittent/ bulb suction ) patient would lead psychological burden patient . We expect main outcome difference group regard ease comfort continuous suction device standard bulb suction . While patient likely prefer one device , tremendous impact recovery general cope disease .</detailed_description>
