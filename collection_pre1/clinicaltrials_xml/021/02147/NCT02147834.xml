	<detailed_description>This prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , single-center ( North Florida- South Georgia VA Medical Center ) study . The study objective determine ranolazine improve angina symptoms 4 month compare placebo among patient defer PCI base FFR measurement . Baseline Procedure : Assessments perform exclusively determine eligibility study would do obtain informed consent . Assessments perform clinical indication ( exclusively determine study eligibility ) may use baseline value even study do informed consent obtain . The assessment include : - Informed Consent - Review subject eligibility criterion - FFR value calculate time cardiac catheterization - Review previous concomitant medication - Frequency symptom quality life prior study accord Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) Screening Visit : The assessment determine eligibility : - Review eligibility criterion - Review cardiac catheterization FFR - Review medication take past 30 day Subjects meet eligibility criterion randomize receive either active drug , Ranolazine match placebo ( non-active drug ) . Staff subject know subject receive active drug placebo . Drug schedule follow : - 1st dose one tablet ( 500mg ) begin even Day 1 - On Days 2-7 , one tablet ( 500mg ) two time day ( 12-hours apart ) . - On Day 8 , increase dose study drug two tablet ( 1000mg ) twice day ; morning evening , 12 hour apart .

Telephone Follow-up : One week phone call make determine well , adverse event , answer question remind subject increase study medication dose . Two month phone call make determine well adverse event . Month 4 Follow-up : - Frequency symptom quality life accord Seattle Angina Questionnaire ( SAQ ) - Assessment well-being - Any hospitalization need revascularization Subjects take study medication 16 week receive phone call study coordinator 30 day last dose study medication .</detailed_description>
