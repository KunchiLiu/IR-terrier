	<detailed_description>In multicenter cross-sectional study , 73 adult patient treat adalimumab ( 40 mg ) every week least 24 week assess psoriasis disease severity measurement Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) adalimumab treatment start , prior sample . Patients interrupted treatment schedule 24 week prior blood sample exclude . Samples patient treat adalimumab inflammatory disease later develop psoriasis also exclude . Percentage PASI improvement compare baseline ( ∆PASI ) represent clinical response . Patients classified nonresponders ( ∆PASI &lt; 50 ) , moderate responder ( ∆PASI 50-75 ) good responder ( ∆PASI 75-100 ) .Serum collect adalimumab trough level anti-drug antibody determination ( Sanquin , The Netherlands ) . By receiver-operator characteristic ( ROC ) analysis , cut-off value adalimumab trough level determine distinguish insufficient adequate responder .</detailed_description>
