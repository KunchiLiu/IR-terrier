	<detailed_description>Based positive outcome numerous randomize , control trial , current European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) guideline current American guideline management chronic heart failure include implantable defibrillator standard care select chronic heart failure patient . Heart failure patient implantable defibrillator often visit hospital unscheduled examination , place great burden healthcare provider . Device manufacturer offer technology remote defibrillator monitor purpose allow physician remotely access patient ' data reduce unnecessary routine interim visit . The Evolution Management Strategies Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Defibrillators ( EVOLVO ) study multicenter randomize trial design ass whether remote management reduce emergency healthcare use heart failure patient implanted defibrillator endow specific diagnostic feature compare standard management consist schedule in-office visit patient response audible alert . Over 16 month , rate emergency department urgent in-office visit heart failure , arrhythmia , device-related event decrease 35 % total healthcare visit 21 % le frequent remote monitoring . The study confirm remote management heart failure patient implanted defibrillator allow timely notification potentially critical situation . Moreover , effect shift healthcare visit emergency department clinic increase appropriateness in-office visit , thereby reduce cost burden healthcare system . Nonetheless , EVOLVO study finding obtain defibrillator equip specific diagnostic alerting capability , thus fully extend different technology . In particular , defibrillator equip alert capability detection possible fluid accumulation decompensation , alert account majority endpoint record study . That alert show associate relatively high rate false positive detection , Diagnostic Outcome Trial Heart Failure ( DOT-HF ) recently show increased number hospital admission among patient audible alert enable . Alternative system RPM ( Remote Patient Management ) allow record body weight blood pressure management heart failure . Continuous monitoring variable fundamental element program patient monitor patient education recommend guideline treatment heart failure . Although daily measure body weight pressure present telemedicine program describe literature , , clinical evidence obtain specifically population patient refer implantable defibrillator therapy scarce . The large observational study ALTITUDE suggest possibility well prognosis patient manage via RPM , particular provide sensor measurement weight pressure .</detailed_description>
