	<brief_summary>The training secondary task walking , whether reason activity , memory motor task , may enhance automation , walk performance , postural control , thus , minimize risk fall influence walk pattern variability . However , literature scarce regard influence dual-task training change gait parameter . The purpose prospective , blind randomize control trial compare short- long-term effect dual-task aerobic training gait stride variability superior cerebral function independent community-dwelling elderly woman . The participant randomly allocate either experimental control groups.The experimental group undertake 50 minutes/day dual-task training , three times/week 12 week , total 36 session , whereas control group receive dose aerobic training . At baseline , 18 36 session , 12 week cessation intervention , researcher blind group allocation collect outcome measures.The intervention deliver trained physical therapist . Primary outcome include gait stride variability , assess movement analysis system : GaitRite® system , cognitive motor dual-tasks , normal fast speed . Secondary outcome measure include battery global specific cognitive function test . The finding trial may help good understand whether cognitive-motor intervention old adult , compare traditional aerobic training , would result great improvement gait dual-task condition lead improvement cognitive task . Furthermore , finding could potentially bring important insight regard impact improvement walk ability cognition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Socially speak , finding could potentially bring important insight regard impact improvement walk ability cognition . If elderly maintain safe gait pattern prevent fall , could reach self-sustained community participation consequently reduce burden care family caregiver . Additionally , public health system may ultimately receive important positive economic social impact . This clinical trial may reproduce research clinical practice environment .</detailed_description>
