	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether chlorthalidone effective hydrochlorothiazide prevent cardiovascular outcome Veterans age 65 hypertension . Both medication thiazide-type diuretic use 50 year consider first-line treatment hypertension . Patients currently prescribe hydrochlorothiazide randomize either continue take hydrochlorothiazide receive chlorthalidone , follow major cardiovascular event , myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke . The study use new , efficient less expensive study design term 'point care ' , study operation conduct centrally patient data collect passively electronic medical record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over 1 million Veterans prescribe thiazide-type diuretic year ; 95 % receive hydrochlorothiazide , few 2.5 % receive chlorthalidone . Both medication thiazide-type diuretic use 50 year consider first-line treatment hypertension . Indirect evidence accumulating , however , chlorthalidone may effective hydrochlorothiazide prevent cardiovascular event . This first randomize head-to-head comparison effectiveness two drug . The study plan enroll 13,500 Veterans 3 year follow average 3 year , result total study duration 4.5 year . Patients currently prescribe hydrochlorothiazide randomize either continue take hydrochlorothiazide receive equivalent dose chlorthalidone . The unique 'point care ' 'clinically integrate ' study design identify , enroll follow subject use electronic medical record system national VA non-VA database . The primary outcome event composite consisting : stroke , myocardial infarction , non-cancer death , urgent revascularization , hospitalization acute congestive heart failure . All patient care , include study drug , continue manage primary care provider . Primary Care Providers also include participant research study . Adding provider subject allow u study implementation point care protocol design addition original research question . The study team collect data diuretic management within study may contact provider phone email learn reason decline particular patient discontinue new chlorthalidone order ongoing diuretic prescription . If cardiovascular event reduce even small amount chlorthalidone , public health effect considerable large number patient take diuretic . A randomized trial , feasible due investigator ' efficient inexpensive design , provide evidence need well inform practice throughout VA .</detailed_description>
