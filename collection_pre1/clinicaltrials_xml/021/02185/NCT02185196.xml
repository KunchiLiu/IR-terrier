	<brief_summary>Background : - Burden : Pneumonia lead cause morbidity mortality under-five child , particularly develop country . - Knowledge gap : Although many study report association vitamin D deficiency pneumonia , lack information therapeutic impact , i.e . impact vitamin D supplementation management childhood pneumonia . - Relevance : Vitamin D play important role modulate innate immune response infection . We , therefore , propose conduct study assess impact vitamin D supplementation , addition standard antibiotic supportive therapy , outcome severe childhood pneumonia . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesise management hospitalize severe pneumonia under-five child , vitamin D3 supplementation , adjunct standard antibiotic supportive therapy , hasten recover severe pneumonia may thereby shorten duration severe pneumonia also reduce risk new episode pneumonia . Objectives : The objective investigator study assess clinical benefit oral supplementation vitamin D3 , addition standard antibiotic supportive therapy , hospitalise , under-five child severe pneumonia . Methods : This would randomise , double blind , control clinical trial ( RCT ) . Children either sex , age 3-59 month , attend Dhaka Hospital icddr , b , clinically diagnose severe pneumonia comprise study population . Eligible child allot sequential study number , previously assign vitamin D placebo accordance randomisation . The study staff mothers/ caregiver child blind whether vitamin D3 placebo add child 's diet . Infants age 3-5 month receive breast milk and/or infant formula , 6 month old receive `` Milk Suji '' complementary food . Vitamin D3 supplementation give five consecutive day , day enrolment addition standard antibiotic supportive therapy . Outcome measures/variables : Primary outcome measure time resolution severe pneumonia . Secondary outcome measure duration hospitalization , fever , tachypnoea , chest drawing , hypoxia , lethargy inability fee hospital stay well new episode pneumonia discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin-D Supplementation : Impact Severe Pneumonia Among Under-five Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis test : In hypothesis test research proposal , briefly mention hypothesis test provide scientific basis hypothesis , critically examine observation lead formulation hypothesis . Does research proposal involve test hypothesis : 0 No 1 Yes ( describe ) The investigator hypothesise supplementation vitamin D3 ( Cholecalciferol ) , addition standard antibiotic supportive therapy management under-five child severe pneumonia significantly shorten duration severity pneumonia thereby reduce hospital stay also reduce risk new episode pneumonia . Specific Objectives : Objective : To assess clinical benefit oral vitamin D3 supplementation , addition standard antibiotic supportive therapy , management hospitalise , under-five child severe pneumonia . Primary objective : To compare duration severe pneumonia child two study group receive standard therapy ( appropriate antibiotic supportive therapy ) receive vitamin D supplementation addition standard therapy . Secondary objective : - To compare duration hospitalization , fever , tachypnoea , chest drawing , hypoxia , lethargy inability fee hospital stay , under-five child two study group , mention primary aim . - To compare recurrence new episode pneumonia next 6 month discharge hospital two study group . - To identify optimum safety dose vitamin D3 different group under-five child . - In severe pneumonia patient also acute watery diarrhoea ass indirect absorption vitamin D measure serum vitamin D level also assess clinical outcome subgroup .</detailed_description>
