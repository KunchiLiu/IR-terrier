	<brief_title>A Pilot Study CC-220 Treat Systemic Lupus Erythematosus .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist 3 part . Part 1 randomize , double-blind , placebo control , ascend dose study evaluate safety tolerability CC-220 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ( SLE ) subject . Subject participation Part 1 consist 3 phase : - Pre-treatment Screening Phase : 28 day prior first dose investigational product ( IP ) - Treatment Phase : 84 day - Observation Phase : 84 day post-treatment A total approximately 40 subject randomize 4 dose group 4:1 ratio CC-220 ( 0.3 mg every day [ QOD ] , 0.3 mg everyday [ QD ] , 0.6 mg 0.3 mg alternate day 0.6 mg QD ) match placebo ( 8 subject CC-220 arm 2 subject placebo arm dose group ) . Subjects randomize first two dose group 0.3 mg QOD 0.3 mg QD parallel . Following confirmation safety first two dose group , remain subject randomize 0.6 mg 0.3 mg alternate day 0.6 mg QD dose group sequential , dose ascend manner ( first 0.6 mg 0.3 mg alternate day dose group follow 0.6 mg QD dose group ) A subject permit reduce dose one time study . The Treatment Phase 84 day duration dose group . Subjects discontinue IP early subject complete 84 day treatment phase enter Observational Follow-up Phase 84 day period . In case early termination study , subject encourage complete Early Termination Visit . Part 2 randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety CC-220 SLE subject skin involvement . It initiate 8 subject complete 28 day treatment 0.6 mg QD dose group Part 1 28 day safety assessment 0.6 mg QD dose group Part 1 complete . Subject participation Part 2 consist 3 phase : - Pre-treatment Screening Phase : 28 day prior start IP - Treatment Phase : Up 84 day - Observation Phase : 84 day post-treatment Up total approximately 100 subject randomize 4 dose group CC-220 ( 0.3 mg QOD , 0.3 mg QD , 0.6 mg 0.3 mg alternate day 0.6 mg QD ) match placebo ( 20 subject CC-220 dose arm 20 subject placebo arm ) . The dose group include Part 2 dependent result Part 1 . Any dose group demonstrate adequate safety , tolerability , PK PD may use Part 2 . The Treatment Phase Part 2 84 day duration . Subjects discontinue IP early subject complete 84- day Treatment Phase enter Observational Follow-up Phase 84-day period . In case early termination study , subject encourage complete Early Termination Visit . Upon completion , discontinuation Treatment Phase Part 1 Part 2 , subject ( include premature discontinuation ) visit 28 day 84 day final treatment visit 84 day Observational Follow-up Phase . The Active Treatment Extension Phase ( ATEP ) extension core CC-220-SLE-001 study evaluate long-term efficacy safety/tolerability CC-220 SLE subject complete Part 1 Part 2 core study . Subjects complete Treatment Phase Part 1 Part 2 core study eligible receive CC-220 ATEP 2 year . All subject participate ATEP receive active treatment receive participation Part 1 Part 2 exception placebo 0.3 mg every day ( QOD ) ( see information dose subject ) . Subjects complete Treatment Phase Part 1 Part 2 core study eligible enter phase study enrol immediately avoid dose interruption . In event ATEP implement subject 's study center time complete Treatment Phase , subject enter Observation Phase core study eligible enroll ATEP upon implementation amendment . There time restriction long subject CC-220 prior enter ATEP long complete treatment Part 1 Part 2 core study . Subjects terminate Treatment Phase Part 1 Part 2 early eligible entry ATEP . Subject participation consist two phase : - Active Treatment Extension Phase : Up 2 year - Observational Follow-up Phase : One month</detailed_description>
