	<brief_summary>MEK162 show significant inhibition tumor growth single agent NSCLC xenograft model mice human cancer cell vitro , KRAS and/or mutation . These data suggest MEK162 may provide potential benefit cancer indication harbor mutation . MEK162 currently investigate phase I clinical test well tolerate MTD 45mg BID cancer patient . There little change survival benefit patient non-small cell lung cancer recent year . Emerging new treatment option rely molecular genetic marker study extensively . Thus , shift manage non-small cell lung cancer molecular target therapy combination standard chemotherapy . This study target patient KRAS mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/Ib Study MEK162 , MEK Inhibitor , Combination With Carboplatin Pemetrexed Patients With Non-squamous Carcinoma Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES 1.1 Primary Objectives - To assess safety MEK162 administer combination carboplatin pemetrexed first line treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . - To determine recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) MEK162 use give continuous dose schedule together pemetrexed carboplatin administer 3-weekly schedule first line treatment advance NSCLC . - To explore efficacy ( measured tumor response Phase Ib portion ) combination MEK162 addition pemetrexed carboplatin treatment-naïve patient EGFR wild-type , ALK-rearrangement negative NSCLC lung . 1.2 Secondary Objectives - To characterize population pharmacokinetics MEK162 administer combination carboplatin pemetrexed ( Phase I ) . - To explore relationship KRAS mutation ( sub-types ) additional genomic mutation objective clinical response . 1.3 Trial End-points Primary Phase I • Development dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , ( define section 4.3 ) measure NCI CTC AE v4 . Phase Ib • Objective response rate ( ORR ) per RECIST v1.1 . Secondary Phase I • Adverse event , serious adverse event , change hematology chemistry value , vital sign , ECGs . Phase Ib - Evaluation response rate ( RR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) disease control rate ( DCR ) patient without KRAS mutation tumor tissue . - Exploratory analysis KRAS mutation sub-type . Exploratory end-points • A limited sampling strategy pharmacokinetic model use ensure clearance MEK162 influence concurrent administration pemetrexed-based chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
