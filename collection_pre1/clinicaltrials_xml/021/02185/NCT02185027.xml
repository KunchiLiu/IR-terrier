	<brief_summary>The arrival market direct oral factor Xa factor IIa inhibitor ( dabigatran ( Pradaxa® ) , rivaroxaban ( Xarelto® ) , apixaban ( Eliquis® ) others soon come ) raise novel question among clinician confront emergency management patient treat new drug . It likely new oral anticoagulant ( NOACs ) eventually win significant market share indication secondary prevention venous thromboembolism prevention cardioembolic event patient nonvalvular atrial fibrillation , due net clinical benefit practicality use compare vitamin K antagonist ( VKAs ) . However , despite fact NOACs reduce incidence intracranial bleeding half compare VKAs , risk remain significant ; furthermore , clinical trial , drug little effect reduce incidence major extracranial bleeding . In everyday practice , indication could expand unselected population due potential misuse , likely incidence bleed complication higher report clinical trial . Indeed , numerous alert emanate regulatory agency various country ( US , Australia , etc . ) bear witness , serve reminder anticoagulant real potential bleeding complication , absence antidote , validate management strategy . Furthermore , drug prescribe month year , patient may eventually expose situation high hemorrhagic risk , emergency surgery invasive procedure , trauma , etc . Analysis data RE-LY trial ( dabigatran versus warfarin patient atrial fibrillation ) show two year follow-up , approximately 25 % patient underwent invasive procedure , range pacemaker insertion major surgery . Thus , large proportion patient treat NOACs concerned issue . In anticipation gradually increase influx patient critical situation ( active bleed need rapidly secure hemostasis invasive procedure ) , urgent define conduct adopt base experience gain early case . This objective French-speaking GIHP-NACO observatory set GIHP ( French Working Group Perioperative Hemostasis ) . For moment , , management recommendation derive expert opinion base pharmacokinetic data partial correction NOAC-induced hypocoagulability various nonspecific procoagulants ( non-activated activate prothrombin complex concentrate , recombinant factor VIIa ) . These procoagulants currently use empirical manner control bleeding , many success failure report literature , benefit-risk ratio patient therefore uncertain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The management critical situation difficult several reason : - First , significant intra- inter-individual variability pharmacokinetics NOACs , heighten critical set drug interaction agent interfere P-GP ( P-GLYCOPROTEIN ) cytochrome P4503A4 patient often elderly multi medicate , rapid variation renal function , essential elimination NOACs . - Second , biological guidance weak : clearcut therapeutic range validate hemostatic safety cutoff , case INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) VKAs . Conventional coagulation test ( PT/aPTT ) poorly standardize difficult interpret . Assays measure serum concentration drug widespread outside teach hospital . - Third , lack clinical experience . Analyses critical situation occur clinical trial do fact data collect heterogeneous incomplete . Clinical case report literature rarely well document . The objective observatory rapidly acquire document thorough feedback clinical experience new drug able confer high level evidence management recommendation treat patient .</detailed_description>
