	<detailed_description>Hemiparesis impairment frequent disable consequence stroke lead asymmetric inefficient walk pattern . Training split-belt treadmill , two separate tread drive leg different speed , correct gait asymmetry post-stroke ( Reisman et al . 2005 , Reisman et al . 2007 ) . However , effect split-belt treadmill train partially transfer everyday walk ground extend training session require achieve long-lasting effect ( Reisman et al . 2009 ) . Our previous study suggest Gait Enhancing Mobile Shoe ( GEMS ) develop laboratory use alternative gait training device people stroke ( Handzic , Reed , colleague 2011 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 ) . The GEMS mimic action split-belt treadmill , use over-ground walk one 's home , thus enable long-term training . This GEMS require external power completely passive ; necessary force redirect natural force present walk since utilizes wearer 's weight generate movement . While movement GEMS similar split belt treadmill , GEMS generate similar aftereffect , efficacy shoe modify gait individual stroke yet verify . This research aim test GEMS individual stroke determine relate effect show healthy subject benefit individual stroke . In study , test efficacy GEMS individual stroke . Efficacy evaluate base change gait coordination also base subject ' self-reported comfort device . We predict GEMS result change interlimb coordination gait . Note efficacy study , effectiveness safety study device ; distinction make clear paper Singal et al . ( 2014 ) . The asymmetric nature hemiparetic gait large impact functional walking ability . For example , swing phase asymmetry significant predictor hemiparetic walking performance strongly correlate stage motor recovery , walk speed , fall ( Brandstater et al . 1983 ; Titianova Tarkka 1995 ) . Another measure temporal asymmetry - double support duration - similarly correlate walk speed ( Olney et al . 1994 ) . In addition , spatial ( e.g . step length ) asymmetry associate decrease propulsive force paretic leg ( Balasubramanian et al . 2007 ; Bowden et al . 2006 ) , limit forward motion body reduce gait efficiency ( Brouwer et al . 2009 ; Kahn Hornby 2009 ) . The importance gait efficiency understate - elevate energy demand hemiparetic gait combine physical deconditioning post-stroke greatly limit performance activity daily live , contribute poor cardiovascular fitness metabolic syndrome . In turn , increase risk second stroke cardiovascular event associate increased morbidity mortality rate ( Ivey et al. , 2005 ) . Therefore , improve gait symmetry important goal therapy , improve functional mobility reduce injury , also enhance general health well-being post-stroke . Practicing walk split-belt treadmill correct abnormal interlimb coordination gait individual hemiparesis follow stroke central nervous system lesion ( Reisman et al . 2005 , Reisman et al . 2007 ) . Asymmetric gait manifest spatial asymmetry , step take one side long . It also manifest temporal asymmetry , time uneven paretic non-paretic side . Temporal asymmetry often measure difference duration double support period , amount time foot simultaneously contact ground measure separately paretic non-paretic side . The GEMS design cause change spatial temporal gait symmetry . We predict GEMS would cause step side GEMS large since individual would compensate backward roll motion place foot far forward stance , thus increase distance two foot . Similarly , since stride longer , may also shorten duration stance relative side . With shortened stance duration , amount time spend double-support end stance would likely decrease well . An alternative GEMS move foot forward , would opposite effect , shorten step lengthen double-support duration foot place . Therefore , effect could obtain use backward-moving GEMS healthy-side foot would obtain use forward-moving GEMS paretic-side foot . In study , focus backward move GEMS . Although original idea GEMS derive motion split-belt-treadmill , distinct difference walk GEMS walk split-belt treadmill asymmetric belt velocity ( Handzic Reed , 2013 ) . While body 's velocity relative ground zero split-belt treadmill , relative velocity GEMS non-zero forward . The GEMS force wearer 's foot forward backward whereas treadmill move foot backward , different speed . For split-belt treadmill GEMS , relative velocity foot similar backward-moving GEMS take place faster tread . Our short-term study examine motion shoe affect change gait . We hypothesize train ground lead change interlimb coordination individual asymmetric gait allow individual develop persistent symmetric gait . There several difference train ground treadmill , visual flow vestibular information signal forward movement likely limit expression learn over-ground context train treadmill . Visual cue appear particularly important context awareness ( Keamey , 2003 ) . Visual cue , couple prior experience , powerful predictive postural response cause individual stumble step onto escalator move ( Reynolds Bronstein 2003 ; Bronstein et al . 2009 ) . The body learn internal model expect acceleration step onto escalator , acceleration occur , person stumble . A recent study split-belt walking show transfer over-ground walking enhance subject blindfold training treadmill test ground ( Torres-Oviedo Bastian , 2010 ) . Since blindfold eliminates visual cue environment , also suggest vision key factor determine context-dependence learning . Since realistic blindfold stroke patient gait training , design GEMS training could occur over-ground walking , thus visual cue train later walk ground would . Data control subject use early version GEMS publish ( Handzic et al . 2011 ) video previous version find http : //reedlab.eng.usf.edu/publications/handzic2011GEMS.mp4 . In study , find early version GEMS capable change step length predict , however previous design heavy tall consider practical test stroke population . The current version GEMS produce similar motion previous version , weigh less ( ~1 kg ) shorter ( ~4.4 cm ) . We test efficacy wear current GEMS gait coordination walk ground individual stroke . All walk perform subject wear gait belt closely guard experienced physical therapist prevent fall . Subjects may wear safety harness attach SOLO-STEPÂ® System ( Solo-Step , Sioux Falls , SD ) necessary . The effect GEMS gait coordination compare induced split-belt treadmill . The propose project represent one first attempt build device corrects walk symmetry walk ground . Not would allow people experience gait correction perform normal movement , simplicity relative low cost device would also open potential opportunity train home ( high-functioning individual supervision ) clinic split-belt treadmill available . The study outline establish whether GEMS capable change interlimb coordination gait , whether individual stroke use device rehabilitation purpose . This work thus build foundation future training study examine effectiveness long-term use GEMS improve symmetric walking pattern . The question study target modification human walking pattern use stroke rehabilitation . It ultimate objective show GEMS change person 's temporal spatial gait asymmetry symmetric gait . Our point reference result obtain previous study split-belt treadmill . We also interest alter interface foot ground influence adaptation new walking pattern .</detailed_description>
