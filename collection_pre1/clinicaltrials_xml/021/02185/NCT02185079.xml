	<brief_summary>Procedural skill important determinant clinical outcome certain patient group . Training procedural skill medical profession still largely base apprenticeship model . For example , trainee learn perform epidural anaesthesia `` practicing '' patient direct supervision senior ( consultant senior registrars/residents ) . Learning complex high risk procedural skill patient ideal . As medical training move apprentice base competency base training along number clinical learning opportunity trainees less , necessary develop comprehensive training programme enables effective efficient learn without compromise patient safety . Metrics-based performance base progression show improve clinical performance novice also expert . We envisage standard methodology could address deficiency procedural train currently . This would entail development validation set metric particular procedure , evaluation proficiency base progression train programme base metric demonstration improve clinical performance clinical outcome associate programme . Although element `` end -end '' approach demonstrate previously various procedure , propose apply methodology entirety placement lumbar epidural catheter analgesia patient labor . To date develop validate set metric procedure . Proficiency base training lead good procedural skill lead well patient outcome study far . Epidural analgesia labor lends excellent model evaluate whole process . It specific procedural skill closely link patient outcome measurable occur finite time interval . The hypothesis study novice anaesthetic trainee , train metric base performance base progression addition improve clinical performance also reduce failure rate labor epidural analgesia 5 % compare 25 % achieve conventional training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Metrics Based Performance Based Progression Provision Labor Epidural Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double blind control study . Ethical committee approval consent participate anaesthetist patient obtain . Trainees recruit Cork University Hospital . Anaesthetic trainees less 2 year experience anaesthesia perform less 50 epidural precede 2 year ( limited labor epidural ) request participate study . The trainee randomize group 1 group 2 . In group 1 , standardize conventional teach train labor epidural analgesia use . In group 2 , train metric base simulation predetermine level proficiency . Each trainee perform 10 labor epidural catheter insertion procedure video record patient consent . Observers blind group use data collection , outcome assessment analysis . Failure rate epidural assess base occurrence one follow event , 1 . Inadequate analgesia 45 minute start epidural needle placement . 2 . Resiting epidural abandoning procedure . 3 . Accidental Dural puncture . 4 . Supervisor take . The primary end point study compare difference epidural failure rate two group . Secondary end point include assessment clinical performance use metric base assessment two blind reviewer base video recording patient satisfaction epidural analgesia . In addition demographic data patient , duration labor , cervical dilation time insertion catheter , length catheter insert , time insertion catheter , experience operator position patient epidural placement note . Age , sex anaesthesia experience trainee also collect . The estimated labor epidural failure rate year 1 trainee 25 % .6 We hope reduce failure rate interventional group 5 % . 48 procedure per group sufficient show statistically significant difference group p value 0.05 % power 80 % . To allow dropout , 8 trainee per group recruit perform 10 procedure make total 80 procedure per group .</detailed_description>
