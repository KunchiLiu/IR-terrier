	<brief_summary>The PATH Triples ( PFT ) Study effectiveness trial compare nurse health navigator ( NHN ) model HIV+ person severe mental illness substance abuse ( i.e. , triply diagnose ) Treatment Usual ( TAU ) . The team complete Phase II trial nurse health navigator model HIV+ person severe mental illness show intervention effective . The investigator test intervention real world set patient recruit psychiatric substance abuse inpatient unit Philadelphia use longitudinal design . The intervention set cascade non-adherent patient receive additional visit study nurse . It hypothesize patient assign NHN good medication compliance , reduce viral load improve CD4 count compare patient assign TAU . It also hypothesize PFT intervention group cost effective compare TAU . This group triply diagnose patient high risk negative health outcome secondary transmission HIV , therefore , study high public health significance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In response PA-12-281 , HIV/AIDS , Drug Use , Vulnerable Populations US ( R01 ) , conduct effectiveness trial among person triply diagnose ( mental illness , substance abuse , HIV ) recruit inpatient psychiatric unit Philadelphia . Despite general recognition person serious mental illness ( SMI ) heighten risk contract transmit human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , systematic HIV test mental health setting rare . Using discard blood sample six-month period , research team find excess 10 % HIV seroprevalence two inpatient psychiatric unit Philadelphia . We argue HIV test routinely conduct setting . In five-year longitudinal effectiveness trial , identify HIV positive SMI inpatient rapid test . Those newly diagnose previously diagnose currently engage HIV treatment also substance use offer opportunity participate randomize community trial . Previously , conduct Phase II trial PATH Positives ( PFP ) observe broad far-reaching effect intervention utilize nurse health navigator ( NHN ) model HIV+ SMI client . The current study build learn previously provide nurse health navigator ( NHN ) model integrate treatment target individual `` real world '' condition monitor implementation PATH Triples ( PFT ) . The target population arguably among high risk patient population poor treatment outcome . Based past experience , expect enroll 75 % eligible rolling basis , ~240 participant randomize . This yield ~120 PFT ~120 Treatment Usual ( TAU ) participants 36-month recruitment window attrition . A similar population PFP result 17 % attrition rate , estimate complete data least 75 % participant result complete dataset ~180 participant ( 90 PFT , 90 TAU ) . PFT participant receive NHN service 6 month . Data collect baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 month participant . Participants follow longitudinally additional 3 month post intervention measure decay intervention withdrawn . Experimental participant begin PFT still receive inpatient service project nurse participate discharge plan facilitate linkage Mental Health ( MH ) , Substance Abuse ( SA ) , Infectious Disease ( ID ) care Philadelphia community . The NHN also meet least weekly experimental participant implement adherence component PFT use approach tailor communication comprehension person include memory aid , education regard side effect treatment aspect , engagement participant ' social network treatment provider , active community outreach . We expect good retention treatment PFT participant improvement outcomes include viral load , CD4 , indicator psychological social functioning , cost effectiveness .</detailed_description>
