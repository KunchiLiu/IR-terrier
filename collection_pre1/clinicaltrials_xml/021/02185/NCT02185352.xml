	<brief_summary>The primary objective A-PLUS trial evaluate compare efficacy induction BEEP ( bevacizumab precondition follow etoposide cisplatin ) follow whole bran radiotherapy ( WBRT ) WBRT alone control brain metastasis ( BM ) metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) patient previously receive WBRT . In past 2 year , research team demonstrate BEEP regimen highly effective treatment brain metastasis breast cancer progress WBRT multi-center phase II study ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01281696 ) . The basic concept preconditioning , refer start bevacizumab 1 day chemotherapy , effect bevacizumab induce tumor vascular normalization take time mature . The investigator hypothesize induction BEEP decrease size brain tumor , effectiveness WBRT would maximize . The investigator expect integrate approach great benefit MBC patient BM , irrespective subtype .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Etoposide Cisplatin Followed Whole Brain Radiotherapy Breast Cancer With Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis ( BM ) occur 20 % 35 % metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) patient . In contrast recent advance systemic treatment MBC , much room improvement treatment BM . At present , standard treatment inoperable/not suitable radiosurgery BM whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) , median overall survival ( OS ) 6 12 month high brain relapse rate range 30 % 100 % . In MBC , 70 % 80 % patient BM present two brain metastatic tumor candidate surgical treatment stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) . Unlike patient solitary oligo-brain metastatic tumor , addition local treatment surgery SRS show improve OS relapse rate ; patient multiple brain metastasis , WBRT remain standard treatment improvement desperately await . Brain consider `` sanctuary '' area systemic drug due protection blood-brain-barrier ( BBB ) . Although preclinical study suggest BBB could disrupt growth brain metastatic tumor , amount chemotherapy drug deliver brain tissue still far low could achieve serum . Bevacizumab , vascular endothelial growth factor antibody , show ability `` normalize '' peri-tumoral vessel preclinical model . The investigator hypothesize addition bevacizumab , chemotherapy drugs—etoposide cisplatin , show also activity BM—will deliver efficiently `` sanctuary '' brain parenchyma , thus increase efficacy BM treatment . Recently , research team demonstrate bevacizumab preconditioning follow etoposide cisplatin ( BEEP ) highly effective treatment brain metastasis breast cancer progress radiotherapy multi-center phase II study . The basic concept preconditioning , refer start bevacizumab 1 day chemotherapy , normalization effect take time mature . In study , 35 patient enrol . Twenty seven patient ( 77.2 % ; 95 % CI 59.9-89.6 ) achieve brain tumor volumetric response , define ≥50 % reduction volumetric sum measurable brain lesion absence increase steroid use , development new brain lesion , progressive neurologic symptom . With median follow-up 11.0 month , median CNS progression free survival ( PFS ) 6.7 month ( 95 % CI 5.1 8.3 month ) , OS 9.4 month ( 95 % CI 7.3 11.5 month ) . At present , lapatinib molecular target agent proven effective MBC patient BM . The CNS response rate first-line lapatinib plus capecitabine 65 % WBRT-naïve , HER2-positive MBC patient BM . However , median CNS PFS still disappointingly short 5.5 month result limit MBC patient HER2-positive . It demonstrate brain tumor size predictor WBRT failure . Given high response rate BEEP BM phase II trial , investigator hypothesize induction BEEP decrease size BM , effectiveness WBRT would also enhance . This integrated approach great benefit MBC patient BM , irrespective subtype . Hence , investigator plan conduct randomized phase II trial evaluate efficacy induction BEEP follow WBRT . Sub study A-PLUS : A Integrated Study MRI PET The Brain Evaluation Neurocognitive Outcomes Patients Brain Metastasis Treated Radiotherapy Chemotherapy . The participant A-PLUS trial may enrol additional study trial . This additional prospective study aim investigate neurocognitive outcome patient brain metastasis treat radiotherapy chemotherapy . The evaluation include neurocognitive assessment , serial MRI FDG PET-CT ( Integrated MR-PET ) study treatment . A total 80 participant enrol . The study protocol approve NTUH REC , No . 201412046MINA .</detailed_description>
