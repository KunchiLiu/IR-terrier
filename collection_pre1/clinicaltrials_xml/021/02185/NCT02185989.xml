	<brief_summary>Early mobilization ( first day possible ) , first passive passive active , recommend critically ill patient reduce duration mechanical ventilation , length hospital stay , improve functional status , muscle strength quality life hospital discharge . The early addition leg bicycle cyclo-ergometer part common practice ICU . It preserve improve muscle strength increase beneficial effect early mobilization . Electrical muscle stimulation quadriceps , practice intensive care unit , , theory , also improvement muscle strength , increase beneficial effect early mobilization . We hypothesize early quadriceps electrical stimulation early work cyclo-ergometer associated standard protocol early passive/active mobilization ICU may improve muscle function reduce duration mechanical ventilation , length stay , number readmission improve quality life mid term critically ill patient , compare conventional protocol early passive/active mobilization .</brief_summary>
