	<brief_title>Repair Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Compared Conservative Treatment First Time Patella Dislocation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Historic treatment first time patella dislocation largely conservative . Treatment option include nonoperative treatment large variety operative option . Nonoperative treatment , usually consist brace and/or immobilization follow physical therapy , problematic due relatively high report redislocation rate ( 1 ) . The force involve patella dislocation event damage articular cartilage patella femoral joint . As result , prevention recurrent patella dislocation associate disability morbidity generate significant interest orthopedic community . Historic surgical approach recurrent patella dislocation mixed result . The isolated `` lateral release '' , show low success rate ( 2 ) , associate complication appreciate . Lateral release procedure often perform conjunction proximal distal realignment procedure ( 3 ) . More aggressive bone realignment procedures tibial tubercle transfer disadvantage report poor long term functional recovery low `` return sport '' rate ( 4,5 ) . There increase interest ligament reconstruction patella dislocation . The ligament interest medial patella-femoral ligament ( MPFL ) , essentially thicken band medial capsule knee . The MPFL establish primary constraint patella dislocation . This ligament extend point anterior attachment medial collateral ligament medial aspect patella , routinely disrupt patella dislocation event . The goal reconstruction procedure replace and/or augment band tissue . While many report result MPFL reconstruction good excellent , significant associate risk complication , prolonged recovery , associate graft cost autograft harvest morbidity . An alternative approach MPFL functional restoration , subject study proposal , direct repair MPFL . Variations approach previously study . A basic understanding establish injury pattern MPFL requisite evaluate limitation study . Studies evaluate MPFL injury MRI show acute patella dislocation high incidence associate MPFL injury . The location lesion ligament describe one four way : 1 ) patellar attachment , 2 ) femoral attachment , 3 ) intrasubstance portion ligament , 4 ) combine injury pattern . Several study demonstrate vary percent distribution injury ( 6,7 ) , clear pattern exist . This conclusion consistent author 's experience treating injury . Detecting injury location also challenge . Arthroscopic examination show ineffective determine location injury ( 8 ) , experience author , MRI evaluation frequently inaccurate , especially chronic recurrent patella dislocation set . The author propose functional intraoperative test determine ligament injury location . Some prior report include surgical treatment MPFL injuries use one technique , result similar nonoperative treatment . For instance , study evaluate treat patella dislocation repair patellar insertion , treatment may limit benefit patient injuries femoral attachment ligament . There two limit report evaluate somewhat similar technique , report indicate best result literature management patella-femoral instability ( 9,10 ) . These result consistent author 's experience treatment condition . The subject study determine difference nonoperative surgical patient outcome use contemporary surgical technique ; identify location injury choose either direct repair appropriate advancement . We hypothesize minimally invasive surgical repair MPFL improve patient outcome minimize recurrent patellar dislocation , compare conservative treatment . Our null hypothesis difference outcomes two group . Methods/Design Trial Design - The study design prospective parallel-group , randomize trial allocation concealment . Participants - At least 50 subject recruit referral primary care provider , specialist , urgent care emergency department , physical therapy clinic within 50 mile radius clinic . Men , woman , minor , age 10-17 recruit . Inclusion criterion : - A first patellofemoral traumatic dislocation - A need reduction - An absence fracture x-ray exam frontal lateral knee axial patella - An absence knee ligament lesion surgical indication ( exception MPFL ) - No previous knee surgery Exclusion criterion : - A prior episode patellofemoral dislocation - Fractures x-ray exam frontal lateral knee axial patella Prior surgery knee - Tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance great 20mm - Current pregnancy plan become pregnant study period . Recruitment - The recruitment process consist two phase . Phase one consist short screening questionnaire , phase two consist clinical examination questionnaire . Recruitment remain open least fifty subject meet inclusion criterion agree participate . Randomization - After screen accept subject recruit process , subject randomly assign either operative group non-operative group mean computer randomize sequence blind allocation . Random sequence generation do use Random Allocation Software 1.0.0. , allocation conceal placing allocation sequentially number , seal envelope . Randomization , allocation , concealment accomplish administrative assistant interest study outcome . Interventions - All subject brief respective treatment protocol . The operative group advise risk surgery , include chance recurrent dislocation , well general risk infection , DVT/PE , anesthesia complication , associate possible complication ( Table 1.1 ) . The non-operative group advise possible failure treatment , possibility recurrent dislocation , possible need surgery ( Table 1.2 ) . All subject receive long stand sunrise x-rays diagnostic purpose . An MRI obtain identify site lesion group . Additionally , ask subject complete Kujala Scoring questionnaire physical activity assessment baseline measurement , intention evaluate subjectively compare two type treatment . Treatment surgical group perform outpatient surgical facility , non-operative group receive treatment physical therapy clinic choice . Surgical Treatment Group - Subjects randomized surgical group treatment undergo surgical repair medial patellofemoral ligament . This identified use MRI scan site lesion . If identify , follow process use determine site lesion : On physical examination , point maximal tenderness patella femur identify assumed site traumatic injury medial patellofemoral ligament . Surgery perform initially diagnostic arthroscopy evaluate loose body chondral damage anywhere patellofemoral joint . A video take provided patient postoperatively . If loose body chondral damage treat , medial patellofemoral ligament repair . An incision make approximately 2 cm length assume site injury . The medial patellofemoral ligament identify tag suture apply . Traction medial patellofemoral ligament location confirm site primary injury determine whether firm endpoint traction . If firm endpoint , secondary incision alternate location , either patella femur , make medial patellofemoral ligament identify location . Repairs medial patellofemoral ligament make site open surgically whether either femur patella , . Surgical repair consist provide decortication bone anatomic location medial patellofemoral ligament . Placement single 5 mm metal suture anchor FiberWire-type suture repair medial patellofemoral ligament use FiberWire suture dock ligament anatomic location . The repair oversew # 1 Vicryl suture site repair . Following , local anesthetic apply incision . They copiously irrigate repair absorbable suture . The subject place hinged knee brace postoperatively range motion restriction 0-45 degree . Weight bearing allow immediately follow surgery . The subject start physical therapy week surgery begin quadriceps strengthen restriction range motion 0-45 first four week postoperatively follow unrestricted full range motion week six . Full sport activity allow resumed eight week , provide patient least 85 % strength quadriceps compare contralateral side . Actual progression individualize base upon patient 's weekly reassessment presence complication . Postoperative follow-up make below-mentioned interval appropriate Kujala score physical activity assessment ( Table 2 ) . X-rays take first postoperative visit confirm location suture anchor repair . Appointments physical examination make 7-10 day , 1 month , three month surgery . Any report recurrent dislocation subluxation event document recovery . All subject receive sunrise x-ray view 3 month manual lateral translation patella , part study . Conservative Treatment Group - The conservative treatment protocol base accepted physical therapy model care establish relative patient tolerance tissue healing , recovery , response modality procedure . Actual progression individualize base upon patient 's weekly reassessment presence complication . Prevention minimization recurrent dislocation , painful subluxation osteoarthrosis paramount early management scenario . The post traumatic post surgical sequela pain , inflammation , swell , bruise muscular deactivation manage acceptable standard practice prescribe medication . Prevention dissipation sequela , include modify activity put excessive stress load patellofemoral joint initial goal rehabilitation concert gradual progression mobility muscular reactivation technique . The protocol divide five phase : Phase I II , 0-4 week ; Phase III , 5-8 week ; Phase IV- 9-12 week , Phase V- 13+ week ( Table 3 ) . In addition physical therapy appointment , subject conservative treatment group give physical examination appointment Kujala outcome score questionnaire physical activity assessment interval surgical intervention group ( Table 2 ) . All subject receive sunrise x-ray view 3 month manual lateral translation patella , part study . Blinding-Due nature study , blind subject assignment treatment group feasible .
