	<brief_summary>Managing blood sugar level important patient type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) minimize health problem complication . One way patient notify doctor receive feedback blood sugar management online system . As Internet-based glucose monitoring system ( IBGMS ) already show effective , investigator hypothesize IBGMS effective intervention even limit feedback non-medicine related change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Internet Monitoring vs Medication Control Blood Sugar Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose : To determine effectiveness Internet-based glucose monitoring system ( IBGMS ) absence medication change . 2 . Hypothesis : IBGMS without medication change comparable conventional medication reduce HbA1c level 8 % patient T2DM . 3 . Justification : Patients T2DM elevate HbA1c level may prescribe additional medication help manage blood sugar level , include oral hypoglycemic agent and/or insulin . As IBGMS show effective reduce HbA1c T2DM , opportunity determine whether system could use alternative medication . The benefit would include reduced side effect result substitute effect medication , well reduce financial cost associate acquire medication . Considering IBGMS increase frequency patient receive feedback change medication compare typical treatment , risk typical patient opt medication change period time . 4 . Objectives : The primary end-point determine patient use IBGMS reduce HbA1c value followup , compare reduction control group typical medication . 5 . Research Method : 120 patient T2DM satisfy inclusion criterion recruit baseline HbA1c establish regular lab blood test . They randomize one two group , one train use IBGMS one control group go appropriate additional medication . The IBGMS group ask report blood sugar endocrinologist biweekly receive feedback report . No medication change offer feedback , lifestyle dietary recommendation may include . The control group ask take new medication indicate endocrinologist . Both group followup visit endocrinologist 3 6 month , also blood test do time point check HbA1c level . The effectiveness intervention evaluate individually . For IBGMS group , rescue secondary endpoint occurs subject maintains HbA1c level great 8 % 3 month ; subject withdrawn study put standard care . 6 . Statistical Analysis : The sample size calculate 120 estimate mean difference standard deviation use data previous study . For calculation statistical power 0.80 alpha 0.05 .</detailed_description>
