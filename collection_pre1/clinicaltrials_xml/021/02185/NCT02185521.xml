	<brief_summary>Philips develop new algorithm , call Hemodynamic Instability Rules Based Advisor ( HIRBA 2.0 ) system , prediction hemodynamic instability critically ill patient , previously know risk . This algorithm provide numerical index - Hemodynamic Instability Index ( HII ) trend calculate exist real time data derive patient 's current hospital stay heart rate blood pressure , lab , Admission - Discharge- Transfer ( ADT ) data help healthcare provider obtain information patient 's status make clinical decision . The aim study determine patient clinical information , display form HII , prompt possible patient hemodynamic status change trigger earlier clinical care team response . Study also identify use Philips new algorithm call Hemodynamic Instability Rules Based Advisor ( HIRBA 2.0 ) improve outcome patient admit intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . During study , upon patient admission ICU clinical data collection begin . Data pull study include : vital sign , medication , reason admission ICU , result blood work , treatment patient may receive . Research subject ask anything far specific activity expect accomplished study participation . Subjects involve study stay ICU . HII information visible clinician , take care patient his/ stay study unit . Patients randomize HII arm ( treatment group ) no-HII - standard treatment arm ( control group ) . Study team collect patient information ability view HII subject randomize HII group arm . For subject randomize control arm study team collect patient 's clinical information clinical care team ability view HII . Once patient leaf ICU study team collect information remainder patient 's hospital course include date hospital discharge . All collect data fully de-identified release Philips analysis . This clinical investigation design answer several key question include : 1 . Are performance metric algorithm operate live host retrospective data ? 2 . Are opportunities improvement host implementation ; include graphical rendering HII information creation alert ? 3 . Are predict workflow result use HII clinically acceptable ? 4 . Is difference clinical measure patient HII display compare ? 5 . What optimal care process follow base presence indicator ?</brief_summary>
