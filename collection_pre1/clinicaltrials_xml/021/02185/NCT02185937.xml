	<brief_summary>The common site GIST occur stomach ( 60-70 % ) proximal small intestine ( 20-25 % ) . Therefore patient GIST often alter GI-tract due tumor resection palliative surgery might affect imatinib exposure . Indeed , Yoo et al . show steady state imatinib trough level patient advance GISTs major gastrectomy lower compare patient previous wedge resection without gastric surgery . Patients underwent major gastrectomy average imatinib plasma trough level 1000 µg/L . This imatinib trough level 1000 µg/L correlate beneficial treatment out-comes ( long Progression Free Survival ) . Since imatinib easily rapidly dissolve pH 5.5 less , lack gastric acid secretion might cause decreased exposure patient underwent major gastrectomy . Therefore investigator would like study exposure imatinib patient major gastrectomy improve create acidic environment absorption combine imatinib intake Coca-Cola .</brief_summary>
