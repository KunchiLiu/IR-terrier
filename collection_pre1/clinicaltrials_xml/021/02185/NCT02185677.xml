	<brief_title>Cognitive Behavioral Dysexecutive Syndrome Multiple System Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) rare neurodegenerative disorder characterize variable combination parkinsonism , cerebellar dysfunction , autonomic failure , additional sign . According consensus criterion diagnosis MSA , presence dementia consider exclusion criterion . However , several study report cognitive impairment patient MSA , dominate dysexecutive syndrome . Some study compare cognitive profile MSA-P patient MSA-C studied behavioral dysexecutive syndrome population . In 2010 , GREFFEX establish criterion dysexecutive syndrome describe two distinct part : dysexecutive syndrome cognitive behavioral dysexecutive syndrome . Our clinical impression accord type MSA , dysexecutive syndrome seem different : MSA-P patient seem cognitive dysexecutive syndrome MSA-C patient behavioral dysexecutive syndrome . We want compare BDSI score MSA-P patient MSA-C patient match disease duration , age sex The specific involvement cerebellum behavioral disorder could explain behavioral difference experience clinician care patient never demonstrate . The presence disorder could impact relationship patient caregiver . In addition , study correlate cognitive imagery data . Therefore , exact area involve cognitive behavioral MSApatients remain poorly understood .</detailed_description>
