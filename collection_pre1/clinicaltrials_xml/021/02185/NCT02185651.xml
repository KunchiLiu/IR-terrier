	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : effectiveness treatment Pompe disease rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) limit least part patient develop antibody provide rhGAA enzyme . Treatment Zavesca® prior infusion may dampen eliminate anti-rhGAA immune response patient receive ERT , thereby allow great ERT efficacy . Treatment Zavesca® enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) may decrease severity , eliminate infusion associate reaction ( IAR ) people Pompe Disease receive ERT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Zavesca® Patients With Pompe Disease Infusion Associated Reaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Study design assess effect Zavesca® immunomodulatory therapy anti-rhGAA immune response patient Pompe disease , well health disease progression . Subjects either receive Zavesca® 100 mg 300 mg dosing level study participation ( n=3 @ 100 mg dosing ; n=3 @ 300 mg dosing ) . The first 3 subject enrol prescribed 100 mg Zavesca® 60 minute prior ERT infusion . The subsequent 3 subject enrol prescribed 300 mg Zavesca® 60 minute ERT infusion . Eligible participant standard ERT Pompe disease history infusion associate reaction . Travel study site Gainesville , Florida require 3 visit . Participants prescribed medication Zavesca® blood test , punch muscle biopsy , physical exam , answer questionnaires 3 month study participation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects patient age 18 year 65 year diagnose Pompe Disease , confirm mutational analysis and/or GAA enzyme activity assay . Receiving rhGAA ERT Willing travel study site study assessment Willingness local medical treatment provider continue treat study participant addition Zavesca® treatment plan . Willingness study participant modify dietary intake day infusion *All Subjects continue enzyme replacement therapy standard care , prescribe local medical treatment provider course Study . Subject unable meet study requirement Subject 's medical condition contraindicates participation Study Investigators feel participation otherwise Subject 's best interest Subject receive ERT treatment Participation interventional study time enrollment may interfere study ( investigator 's discretion ) Unable travel University Florida study visit</criteria>
