	<brief_summary>Cannulation internal jugular vein ( IJV ) central venous access standard practice cardiac surgery . In study , author test hypothesis use ultrasound ( US ) scanner would increase success IJV cannulation decrease incidence complication adult cardiac surgical patient . The study include adult cardiac surgical patient , randomize two group ( control v . US ) . In control group , IJV cannulation perform conventional landmark technique use Seldinger method . In US group , course IJV mark cannulation use 2 - 4 MHz transthoracic echocardiography probe . The success rate , number attempt , cannulation time complication rate compare two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Static Ultrasound Guidance Internal Jugular Vein Cannulation Adult Cardiac Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use real time ultrasound recently recommend standard care insertion central venous catheter . However , usage limit various factor include availability , space constraint perceive lack need accord survey include cardiovascular anesthesiologist . We conduct prospective randomize control trial compare conventional landmark technique static ultrasound ( US ) technique utilized transthoracic echocardiography ( TTE ) ultrasound probe supply along transesophageal echocardiography machine internal jugular vein cannulation adult cardiac surgical patient . After ethical committee approval patient consent , adult patient schedule elective cardiac surgery randomize undergo internal jugular vein cannulation either two method : standard landmark technique ( group A : control group ) , static US technique use TTE probe ( group B : ultrasound group ) . The success rate , number attempt , total cannulation time complication rate two group compare .</detailed_description>
