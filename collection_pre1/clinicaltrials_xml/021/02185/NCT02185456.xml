	<brief_summary>Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) common form vaginitis worldwide , affect million woman . Unfortunately , recurrence rate symptomatic BV remain extremely high , 30 % three month 70-80 % within year . Given paucity information data regard pathogenesis BV , etiopathogenesis recurrent bacterial vaginosis remain unknown . Accordingly , reliable , proven treatment regimen Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis ( RBV ) available . In 2013 , investigator publish two manuscript document new qPCR base approach BV diagnosis potentially prognosis . The method ( LbRC ) measure content lactobacilli vaginal sample , relative total bacterial load . The first goal study validate metric reliable diagnostic BV , determine sensitivity specificity relative Nugent score Amsel criterion healthy woman BV patient . A high LbRC score ( 3-4 ) correspond healthy state . The second goal determine whether empirically determine `` low '' LbRC score ( 1-2 ) BV patient treatment indicator recurrence , whether preemptive action , base score , intensive treatment , delay eliminates recurrence patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A standard care ( SOC ) treatment BV oral metronidazole 500 mg twice day 7 day ( 8 ) . The investigator use enrollee BV initial treatment . The investigator evaluate patient visit LbRC score ; score 1-2 ( low ) indicate notable level non-lactobacilli present . BV subject clinical cure ( Amsel ) LbRC score 3-4 ( high ) Visit 2 simply monitor monthly basis treatment ( Group G1 ) . The investigator expect Group 1 patient eventually recur , LbRC score drop 1-2 , two week prior recurrence BV symptom , event investigator term `` conversion '' . The investigator choose randomly , use Excel randomizer , half `` convert '' patient ( Group G2 ) treat high dose metronidazole ( HDM ) regimen , one 750 mg metronidazole/ 200 mg miconazole vaginal suppository daily 7 day , determine treatment initiate LbRC `` warn '' prevents recurrence . These randomized re-treated Group G2 subject move Group B2 . Patients `` cure '' Amsel criterion Nugent score LbRC score Visit 2 , randomly divide 2 group per pre-randomization code laboratory . One ( B1 Group ) monitor monthly 9 month recurrence , treatment interval . Another group ( B2 ) randomize receive HDM treatment , monitor long term recurrence 9 month . The Lab notify nurse study number subject randomize retreated HDM . The nurse contact subject come urine pregnancy test medication instruction use . All subject ask obtain daily vaginal sample , store room temperature return next visit supply obtain . Subjects continue take daily specimen long subject enrol willing . All subject return daily sample compensate time $ 25 Target gift card visit . Fifty non-BV subject history `` vaginitis '' past year enrol control Group H see monthly monitor LbRC vaginal secretion . All subject ask take daily date vaginal sample store supply container room temperature return vaginal swab monthly visit receive supply next month specimen . All subject compensate $ 25 gift card Target schedule visit time return vaginal swab sample . Subjects Group G1 B1 recur acute symptomatic BV , randomly half Group G1 `` convert '' good LbRC score poor LbRC score without symptom , offer take 7 day HDM vaginal suppository regimen one time . Should subject relapse take HDM vaginal suppository , drop study give prescription conventional SOC treatment BV . Should subject return trichomonas infection drop study treat prescription medication . Should subject return vulvovaginal candidiasis , give prescription anti-yeast medication may continue study . Purpose study : Diagnosis : Is sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value LbRC equal well Nugent Score commercial test ( BD Affirm VIII , BV Blue , target qPCR ) ? Prognosis individualize therapy : Does poor LbRC score post-treatment , `` cure '' BV patient predict rapid recurrence ? Does intervention rigorous treatment , base score , delay prevent recurrence ? The propose pilot study randomize pilot , prospective study enroll least 50 healthy woman 140 woman acute recurrent BV</detailed_description>
