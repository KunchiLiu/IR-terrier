However , placebo control group employ study , between-group efficacy versus placebo could assess . The current grant submission propose conduct first double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study provide preliminary assessment efficacy mirtazapine versus placebo decrease alcohol use depressive symptom person comorbid AD/MDD .
