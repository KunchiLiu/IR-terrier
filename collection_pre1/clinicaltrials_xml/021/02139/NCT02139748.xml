	<brief_title>The Clinical Effect Implant Placement With Simultaneous Soft Tissue Allograft</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>30 patient dental implant place maxillary site teeth number 4 13 . Any implant system acceptable since objective study evaluate soft tissue thickness due graft placement , evaluate implant . 15 patient randomly select coin toss receive one layer ADM ( Control Group ) another fifteen receive one layer ADM bovine-derived xenograft ( Test Group ) . The graft place simultaneously dental implant . A blinded examiner use . Should examiner become unblinded subject exclude study . Each patient receive diagnostic work-up include standardize radiograph ( periapicals ) , study cast , clinical photograph , periodontal examination . Presurgical preparation include detailed oral hygiene instruction . Baseline data collect initial exam . Parameters measure include : plaque index , gingival index , probe depth , keratinize tissue , bleed probing , adjacent tooth recession , radiographic examination , tissue esthetic , color , contour , clinical photograph take baseline , surgery post-op visit . The treatment randomly assign use coin toss . The mentor flip coin . The surgical procedure consist reflection full thickness flap expose buccal crest . A dental implant place edentulous site . Any implant system acceptable since objective study evaluate soft tissue thickness contour , dental implant . Either one layer ADM one layer ADM plus bovine-derived xenograft ( BX ) place follow implant placement buccal aspect implant . When one layer ADM use place buccal surface implant . When one layer ADM BX use BX overlay buccal implant , cover ADM . Thus buccal surface either one layer ADM one layer ADM BX . The surgical procedure document clinical photograph . Records keep heal every 2 week first 8 week , 4 month 16 week . At end 16 week 4 month , study complete , post crown procedure implant start . To provide adequate room establish emergence profile implant platform 3 4 mm apical mid-facial gingival margin 2-stage dental implant system use . This may require reduction osseous crest scallop bone mid-facial osseous crest 3-4 mm apical mid-facial gingival margin . This may result sub-crestal position interproximal implant platform ( measure negative number ) . The top implant even crestal bone . The implant use dental implant . At time surgery implant platform place even mid-facial osseous crest two-stage implant use . All probe measurement take use University North Carolina probe . One investigator unaware group assignment perform baseline examination follow-up examination . He calibrate prior study initiation assure evaluation consistent . The surgeon perform surgical procedure know group participant assign . Standardized periapical radiograph take implant placement 4-month examination . All patient see 1-2 , 3-4 , 5-6 7-8 , 16 week buccal , occlusal lingual clinical photograph take visit . Patients take doxycycline hyclate 100 mg qd two week , Vicodin ES q4-6h need pain , naproxen 375 mg q12h one week inflammation . At post-operative visit plaque removal , oral hygiene instruction , need , perform along clinical photograph standardize radiographs schedule .</detailed_description>
