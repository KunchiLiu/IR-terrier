	<criteria>In good health judgment Investigator determine medical history , physical examination , screen laboratory assessment . Female childbearing potential must negative result screen serum pregnancy test must agree practice contraception method prove reliability ( include abstinence ) duration study . Pregnant lactate female . Clinical evidence significant acute chronic disease may interfere successful completion trial . Clinically significant history follow : cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia , serious respiratory disease include bronchitis asthma , endocrine disorder , liver disease , glaucoma , gastrointestinal disease , disorder reticuloendothelial system , neurologic illness . History angioedema nephrotic syndrome . Noncontrolled arterial hypertension . Anemia screen . Significant proteinuria ( &gt; 1 + urine dipstick ) and/or history acute renal failure and/or severe renal impairment blood urea nitrogen creatinine 2.5 time upper limit normal screen and/or currently receive dialysis . Elevated liver enzyme ( aspartate transaminase , alanine aminotransferase ) Gammaglutamyl Transferase ) equal great 1.5 time upper limit screening . Previously receive rabies vaccine and/or rabies immune globulin . Received infusion blood/plasma product fraction within past 12 month , include type immune globulin . Known adverse reaction administration immune globulin blood/plasma product . Experienced anaphylactic shock administration blood/plasma product . Known medical history selective immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency . Received corticosteroid , immunosuppressant , immunomodulators within 6 week prior screen . Expects receive oral topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , acetaminophen , antihypertensive , and/or antihistamine 24 hour investigational product administration Baseline/Treatment , Study Day 0 visit . Currently receive antiviral treatment . Screening laboratory result indicative acute chronic infection hepatitis A virus ( HAV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , parvovirus B19 ( B19V ) . Participated another clinical trial within 30 day prior screen ( image study without investigative treatment permit ) receive investigational product within previous 3 month . Not willing postpone receive live virus vaccine 3 month receive investigational product . History psychiatric illness require hospitalization . Known substance prescription drug abuse past 12 month . Any active medical illness Investigator may consider potential confounding condition would interfere study visit and/or procedure .</criteria>
