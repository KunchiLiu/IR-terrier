	<brief_title>Evaluating Novel Working Memory Training Program Decrease Symptoms PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress Disorder ( PTSD ) chronic debilitate disorder affect million people year ( Kessler et al. , 2005 ) . Although effective psychosocial pharmacological treatment exist disorder , many 50 percent individual still experience symptom treatment ( Schottenbaeur et al. , 2008 ) . Empirical literature suggest cognitive deficit may play role maintain symptom individual PTSD variety mechanism , include decreased cognitive control intrusive thought ( Verwoerd et al. , press ) dysregulation neural circuitry link prefrontal cognitive control function amygdala activity ( McNally , 2007 ) . The goal propose research improve candidate 's understanding cognitive mechanism PTSD symptom build skill conduct treatment research . The application aim test novel methodology approach PTSD treatment base modification underlie cognitive mechanism disorder . To end , 50 participant PTSD randomly assign 8-session executive control train condition design improve work memory function control condition . The aim study 1 ) To test effect work memory train program work memory performance 2 ) To examine effect program PTSD symptom . The research plan complement set training goal candidate achieve propose award period . These include 1 ) training use fMRI neuropsychological assessment 2 ) additional coursework seminar cognitive science biostatistics use future work , 3 ) experience teach undergraduate graduate set present original work publication preparation career academic research . Taken together , research training component grant application facilitate candidate 's long-term goal conduct treatment outcome basic mechanism research PTSD . Moreover , per strategic plan outline NIMH , application design develop innovative intervention base prior clinical research knowledge cognitive neurobiological feature disorder , advance knowledge mechanism fear learn . It design target core cognitive feature disorder effort reduce symptom . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : Post-traumatic stress disorder impact million Americans , associate significant personal distress well societal cost . The current application design examine effect novel work memory train program PTSD symptom . This approach promising may cost- effective accessible method decrease symptom associate disorder .</detailed_description>
