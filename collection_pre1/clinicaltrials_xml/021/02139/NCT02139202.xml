	<detailed_description>This pilot study part large study . Our plan test implementation new model care delivery build infrastructure develop test NIH Support ( RC2 AG036592-01 , Asch Volpp , Multiple PIs ) . We aim improve medication adherence patient follow hospital admission acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . Poor adherence cardioprotective medication lead bad medical treatment outcome , high hospitalization mortality rate , increase health care cost among CAD patients.20,21 ( reference list full grant submission ) Hence , medication adherence among patient important modifiable factor affect triple aim improve health care quality , improve health , low cost . In Pilot , want test alternate approach recruit patient population hop increase enrollment rate great main trial . Our hypothesis enrollment barrier high , participant enrol study already possess predisposition medication adherence base interest research participation . By increase percentage patient enroll , believe enable research result generalizable include patient population , may experience medication adherence problem indicate lack willingness participate research . By increase percentage patient enroll , attempt include patient may receive benefit improved adherence offer program . In pilot study plan recruit patient UPHS Health System . Patients decide enroll place abbreviate , 6-month version HeartStrong research program offer main intervention . The modification recruitment procedure test inclusion GlowCap electronic pill bottle recruitment mailing send prospective participant , thus lower enrollment barrier give patient direct contact electronic pill bottle . We examine enrollment rate use method comparison method use main intervention . We believe include GlowCaps recruitment packet provide couple benefit . First , participant opportunity see pill bottle well understand study intervention begin recruitment process . Second , study team able conduct recruitment , verbal consent GlowCap set space single phone call . While make phone call longer , logistics get patient phone multiple time point challenge , opportunity encapsulate effort one call beneficial engagement advisor patient . We also test effect upon adherence rate remove financial incentive patient 's medication adherence level . Participants choose enroll research program receive compound set approach include : ( 1 ) provision 4 Vitality GlowCaps , remote monitoring medication bottle reminder device , aspirin , beta blocker , statin , receive stent plavix similar anti-platelet agent ; ( 2 ) assignment engagement advisor study team ; ( 3 ) enlist family member friend ( patient choice ) support person medication adherence ; ( 4 ) engagement incentive use lottery win dependent medication adherence ; ( 5 ) self-service/customization Way Health platform communication method . Participants program offer component ; however , still able participate even opt use list . At 3-month point , participant tell incentive portion complete continue use electronic pill bottle 3 month receive component study .</detailed_description>
