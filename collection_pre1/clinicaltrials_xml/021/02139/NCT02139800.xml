	<brief_summary>This study 2-arm randomize , control , multi-center clinical trial determine two strategy birth best optimally aerate lung preterm infant . Specifically determine 600 infant 23-26 week gestational age ( GA ) require respiratory support birth two lung open strategy - either standard PEEP/CPAP 5-7 cm H2O delivery room ( DR ) , compare early lung recruitment use Sustained Inflation ( SI ) DR , result low rate combine endpoint death bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) 36 week gestational age . Hypotheses : 1 . Early lung recruitment SI superimpose upon standard PEEP/CPAP DR reduce need mechanical ventilation first seven day life , reduce need surfactant use ; 2 . A policy DR SI standard PEEP/CPAP recruitment confer well outcomes 36 week post-menstrual age ( PMA ) standard PEEP/CPAP</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The SAIL trial aim provide evidence changing policy standard care . The context trial unacceptable rate poor long-term outcome preterm infant bear Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns ( ELGAN ) &lt; 1000 g birthweight ( BW ) , especially born 23-26 week ' gestational age ( GA ) . Such infant vulnerable immature organ system , include lung brain . These infant high risk death bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) initial hospitalization , neurodevelopmental impairment ( NDI ) pulmonary problem infancy childhood . The SAIL trial focus facilitate difficult transition vulnerable infant liquid fill in-utero lung ex-utero air-filled lung . Sustained Inflation ( SI ) promise delivery room ( DR ) intervention , evidence short-term efficacy minimal risk additional harm beyond current standard accept Newborn Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) Guidelines . This protocol propose fully inform consenting procedure . We propose evaluate impact SI DR need mechanical ventilation first week life would also impact mortality rate incidence severity BPD .</detailed_description>
