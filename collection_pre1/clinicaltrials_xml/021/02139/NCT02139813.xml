	<brief_summary>Several prospective trial metaanalysis demonstrate superiority bariatric surgery medical treatment obesity . The Roux-en-Y Gastric ByPass ( RYGBP ) procedure practice 30 year , procedure choice morbidly obese metabolic disorder reference center . Nevertheless , RYGBP technically demand procedure learn curve 75 case . The complication rate around 10 % expert center . More recently another procedure describe seem efficient weight loss co-morbidities RYGBP , advantage less technically difficult less morbid , especially multi-complicated obese and/or super obese . It consist unique gastro-jejunal anastomosis long gastric pouch jejunal Omega loop . However , procedure could risk biliary reflux anastomotic ulcer dysplastic change gastric esophageal mucosa . As result , Omega loop bypass ( OLB ) develop team remain controversial subject , particularly one monocentric randomize trial compare RYGBP , remain gold standard . The first litterature result show similar even good weight loss efficiency RYGBP good feasibility . The early complication rate seem low , still insufficient data long term morbidity biliary reflux consequence . By perform randomized prospective comparison OLB RYGBP , aim investigator study analyze weight loss efficiency , morbidity mortality , feasibility , quality life technique , order validate Omega loop bypass procedure choice bariatric surgery Hypothesis : The OLB , efficient RYGBP weight loss metabolic complication , could less morbid .</brief_summary>
