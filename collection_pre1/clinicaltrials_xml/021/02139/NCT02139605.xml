	<brief_summary>Stomach cancer second common cause cancer-related death India . Curative surgery offer chance improve survival cancer . In patient whose cancer spread part body ( beyond stomach lymph node around ) , removal stomach ( gastrectomy ) lymph node around stomach along major vessel supply blood stomach ( D2 lymphadenectomy ) regard current standard care Tata Memorial Centre . However , extent lymphadenectomy controversial . Some study suggest remove lymph node , even around major vessel abdomen ( aorta inferior vena cava ) may help accurately determine disease spread , may also confer additional survival benefit . Removing lymph node around major vessel may increase risk morbidity patient . In last 5-6 year , stomach cancer specialist around world resort give half cycle chemotherapy patient surgery ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy ) , half surgery call 'perioperative chemotherapy ' . This show lead patient survive 5 year , . The investigator feel perioperative chemotherapy D2 lymphadenectomy may constitute best care patient stomach cancer removal lymph node beyond require . However , investigator evidence literature support hypothesis . The investigator thus design trial base propose exists difference D2 lymphadenectomy D3 lymphadenectomy follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy non-metastatic , locally advance resectable gastric cancer . The data enable development clear management guideline lymph node dissection stomach cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` Phase III Randomized Trial Comparing D2 v D3 Lymphadenectomy With Gastric Cancer Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The data comparing D2 D3 come multi-institutional , non-randomised study report D3 lymphadenectomy confer survival advantage D2 tumours 50-100mm diameter , without lymph nodal disease . Of three published randomise control trial ( RCT ) compare D2 versus D2+paraaortic nodal dissection ( PAND ) , two study long-term result available , carry Japan . In study , patient offer chemotherapy develop recurrence . Another reason benefit survival , albeit modest , patient undergo D3 lymphadenectomy note study Wu et al . Another important reason compare D2 versus D2+PAND , lie fact none aforementioned RCTs perform 1998 revision definition lymph node station Japanese Gastric cancer association . Hence , none result consider representative current classification . Duly consider possible high morbidity show complete para aortic lymph node dissection , investigator propose study extensive lymphadenectomy D2 without increase risk morbidity patient . D2 lymphadenectomy perform Tata Memorial Centre ( TMC ) , since 2002 morbidity mortality rate comparable world literature It standard form lymphadenectomy TMC . Hence , trial perform surgeon experience technique . D3 perform centre Japan , Italy Taiwan ( randomize control trial demonstrate survival benefit D3 D1 ) . Both procedure well establish regarded standard different part world .</detailed_description>
