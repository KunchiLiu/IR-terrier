	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Extended Release Immediate Release Febuxostat Participants With Gout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call febuxostat . Febuxostat test decrease maintain serum urate people gout . This study look serum urate level people take febuxostat extend release ( XR ) capsule compare febuxostat immediate release ( IR ) capsule placebo . The study enroll approximately 1750 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance ) one five treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Febuxostat 40 mg XR - Febuxostat 80 mg XR - Febuxostat 40 mg IR - Febuxostat 80 mg IR - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient . All participant ask take one capsule time day throughout study , ask call interactive voice response system time gout flare . In addition study medication , participant also take 0.6 mg colchicine every day every day , naproxen 250 mg twice day lansoprazole 15 mg day prevent gout flare ups . This multi-centre trial conduct United States . The overall time participate study approximately 4 month participant make 7 visit clinic .</detailed_description>
