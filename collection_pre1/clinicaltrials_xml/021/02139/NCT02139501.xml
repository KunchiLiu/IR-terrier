	<brief_summary>The project undertake Qilu Hospital Shandong University well-known hospital China . In order study efficacy safety different dose frequency Recombinant Human thrombopoietin treat primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Investigation rhTPO With Different Frequencies Management ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , multicentre , randomise control trial 30 primary ITP adult patient 3 medical center China . They randomly assign 1:1:1 ratio three group .The patient group A ( total 10 patient ) receive rhTPO dose 300Units/kg , daily 14 consecutive day ; The patient group B receive rhTPO dose 300Units/kg , one time every day 7 times.The patient group C receive rhTPO dose 300Units/kg , daily 7 consecutive day .All patient follow flexible dosage depend platelet count follow 12 week . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment , order evaluate efficacy safety different dose frequency Recombinant Human thrombopoietin treat primary immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</detailed_description>
