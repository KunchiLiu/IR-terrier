	<brief_summary>Each year , 11,000 people suffer spinal cord injury ( SCI ) U.S . Within first year , profound decline physiologic function , form underlie substrate future cardiovascular disease . In fact , acquire cardiovascular disease increasingly recognize consequence SCI lead cause death SCI . Though incompletely understand , almost 10-fold prevalence cardiovascular disease result part profound physiologic 'detraining ' result motor impairment immobility . Currently , effective intervention prevent acute decline lead cardiovascular compromise increase risk SCI lack - exercise therapy SCI challenge employ , typically limited upper body . Recently , investigator refine unique form exercise SCI specifically mirror exercise perform without SCI . Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) Row Training ( RT ) couple volitional arm electrically control leg exercise , result hemodynamic profile produce beneficial cardiac loading condition large muscle mass exercise . As , FES-RT may safe effective way attenuate cardiovascular decline follow SCI . The investigator aim test overall hypothesis FES-RT : 1 ) mitigate increase visceral adiposity reduce insulin sensitivity , 2 ) prevent worsen lipid profile compromise baroreflex function , 3 ) counter ventricular wall thicken decline ventricular function occur acute SCI , effect great observe arms-only exercise group . Changes FES-RT compare time ( wait-list ) control arms-only-RT . Individuals SCI within last 3-6 month randomize immediate FES-RT , time control begin FES-RT 6 month wait , 6 month arms-only-RT follow FES-RT . Measures make baseline every 3 month . The investigator work provide result clearly delineate potential health benefit FES-RT , FES-RT effective majority SCI , application , implementation , integration could easily replicate .</brief_summary>
