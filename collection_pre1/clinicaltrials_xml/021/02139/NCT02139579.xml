	<brief_summary>Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase one popular target molecule field anticancer drug research . EGFR highly express many type tumor cell , could activate EGFR cytosolic kinase activity bind ligand EGF , regulate gene expression , cell proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis different signal transduction pathway . Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) , competitive specifically combine EGFR kinase domain , thus inhibits kinase activity , thereby block cancer cell proliferation metastasis . At present , EGFR-TKI widely use clinical activity , especially patient EGFR mutation , prove achieve certain effect . But passage time , drug resistance inevitable . At present , study find cessation treatment immediately EGFR-TKI resistance may lead rapid progress cancer . Chemotherapy , one widely accept modality cancer treatment , might also one salvage therapies target treatment . Therefore , patient well physical status ( PS ) score , chemotherapy commonly applicable . In January 2010 , study publish journal Clinical Lung Cancer report application chemotherapy salvage treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient resistant first-line EGFR-TKI treatment . Of 114 patient enrol , 67 receive sequential chemotherapy , 47 patient receive best supportive care . The result show , sequential chemotherapy improve survival time patient , compare chemotherapy supportive care group ( 11.2 month vs. 3.8 month , P &lt; 0.01 ) . Furthermore , receive sequential chemotherapy , regimen contain paclitaxel get high efficiency disease control rate without ( 48.7 % vs. 21.4 % , 79.5 % vs. 53.5 % , P &lt; 0.05 ) , well longer progression-free survival ( PFS , 5.1 month vs. 1.8 month , P &lt; 0.01 ) overall survival ( OS , 12.7 month vs. 7 month , P &lt; 0.01 ) . Another study Taiwan enrol 195 patient treat least 1 cycle sequential chemotherapy first-line gefitinib show similar result . Generally , gefitinib first-line treatment PFS 5 month , second-line treatment efficiency 14.4 % . Regimens platinum paclitaxel well treatment efficiency ( 50.6 % ) . A poor therapeutic effect report gefitinib second-line therapy ( 5.6 % ) . In total , median OS second-line treatment 12.2 month . In addition , platinum contain regimen survival good ( 21.7 month vs. 8.9 month , P &lt; 0.01 ) ; patient mutant EGFR benefit platinum-based chemotherapy ( 24.5 month vs. 8.5 month , P &lt; 0.05 ) . Bevacizumab ( trade name Avastin ® ) kind recombinant humanize monoclonal immunoglobulin gamma-1 ( IgG1 ) antibody , selectively inhibit combination process vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor , Flt-1 kinase domain receptor ( KDR ) endothelial cell . A reduction tumor angiogenesis , blood supply , oxygen nutrient supply could obtain VEGF loss biological activity , thus inhibit tumor growth . The drug approve first-line treatment advance colorectal cancer 2004 America food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , thus become first clinical use drug target VEGF . As first globally approve anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody drug , bevacizumab approve advanced colorectal cancer , lung cancer , breast cancer , renal cell carcinoma malignant glioma patient , use 500000 case . In field advance NSCLC treatment , clinical result confirm bevacizumab combine chemotherapy prolong OS PFS patient NSCLC , well tolerate . The thirty-fifth annual meeting European Society Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) conference release meta analysis result bevacizumab combined platinum chemotherapy first-line treatment advance non squamous NSCLC . It confirm , treatment bevacizumab base chemotherapy advance non squamous NSCLC patient could achieve significant survival benefit , prolong remission time , expect safety . Therefore , investigator design phase II testify efficacy safety bevacizumab + chemotherapy EGFR-TKI resistant non squamous NSCLC .</brief_summary>
