	<brief_summary>Capsaicinoids ( active ingredient hot pepper ) show cause moderate increase energy expenditure ( 50 kcal/day ) well reduction appetite , energy intake , ( visceral ) adiposity . As , considerable interest capsaicinoid weight loss supplement . Of particular interest recent finding free-fatty acid blood elevate 2-2.5hrs post ingestion , yet change typical cardiovascular sympathetic nervous tone indicator ( heart rate , blood pressure ) unaffected , suggest negative consequence stimulant may avoid . At present , however , depth investigation effect endothelial function , vascular autonomic tone inflammation lack . The investigator seek understand effect 3 month capsaicinoid ingestion alteration body composition , traditional cardiovascular risk factor cardiovascular function Hypotheses : 1 ) Continued use capsaicinoids alter rest metabolism substrate use , result moderate ( clinically meaningful ) alteration body composition manifest decrease adiposity . 2 ) Blood lipid unaffected capsaicinoid use , brachial blood pressure . 3 ) Levels systemic inflammation may increase slightly , could effect vascular reactivity hyperemic flow baseline vascular tone . However , previous research suggest alteration manifest autonomic nervous tone assess change heart rate variability .</brief_summary>
