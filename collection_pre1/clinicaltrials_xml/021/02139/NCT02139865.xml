	<brief_summary>When practice weightlift regularly body make new protein within muscle . These new protein increase size cell within muscle make large , process call hypertrophy . The common convention surround gain skeletal muscle size strength heavy weight need . In contrast , lift light weight think require induce muscular endurance promote growth . However , previously show untrained men lift light weight result similar gain muscle mass strength lift heavy weight . The purpose study examine perform resistance training different intensity ( light heavy weight ) affect degree muscle growth strength gain individual already resistance training . This information valuable designing exercise protocols increase muscle size strength age , individual return injury , way stimulate muscle growth promote strength gain without need lift heavy weight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients visit laboratory Dr. Stuart Phillips Ivor Wynne Centre ( IWC ) McMaster University 14 week number test exercise session . Each visit follow : Visit 1 : Upon obtain consent , eligible participant complete medical screening questionnaire determine readiness perform exercise well fill form determine subject characteristic . Participants begin collect data first 3-day diet record . They record diet ( 2 weekday weekend day ) 6 week ( mid-protocol ) 12 week study . Visit 2 : Participants report lab 08.00 10.00 h undergo body composition scan include BodPod ( assess fat mass ) , bioelectrical impedance ( BIA - ass total body water content ) , Dual-energy x-ray- Absorptiometry ( DXA- determine bone mineral content ) . All test perform post-absorptive state ( 12 hour ) . Participants also familiarization lab exercise equipment determine preliminary resistance training ( RT ) load . Visit 4 : Participants report lab determine one-repetition-maximum leg press , leg extension , bench press shoulder press . This do participant attempt weight base familiarization session ; complete weight though full range motion good form , rest 3-5 min attempt high weight 1RM reach . Visit 5 : Participants report lab post-absorptive state ( 12 hour ) rest muscle biopsy muscle outside thigh . Visits 6 : Participants randomly assign one two exercise intensity treatment group : ~30 % 1RM ( equate ~20-25 repetition per set ) 3 set failure ( 25 subject ) 80 % 1RM 3 set failure ( another 25 subject ) . All set 60 second rest . On two occasion ( one beginning study another end ) , participant return lab post-absorptive state catheter ( plastic tube small needle ) insert vein arm . A rest blood sample take . Upon completion first exercise session , subsequent blood sample take 15 minute , 30 minute 60 minute determines acute time course change blood metabolite hormone . Visit 7-54 : Participants attend supervise exercise session 4 time per week ( Monday , Tuesday , Thursday Friday ) alternate low body upper body focus session 12 week . Participants 30 % ( LOW ) group perform approximately 20-25 repetition per set participant 80 % ( HIGH ) group perform approximately 8-12 repetition per set . Immediately follow resistance training session well prior sleep , participant consume 30g whey protein . 1RM test repeat every three week throughout protocol conduct prior begin last every 12 training session . Prior complete final training session ( session number 48 ) participant arrive lab post-absorptive state blood sample procedure describe previously . Visit 55 : Participants arrive post absorptive ( fast ) state 48 hour follow last training session . They undergo final BodPod , DEXA BIA scan determine body composition well final rest biopsy vastus lateralis muscle .</detailed_description>
