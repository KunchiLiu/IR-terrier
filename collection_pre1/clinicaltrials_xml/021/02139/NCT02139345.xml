	<brief_title>TC-A Registration Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) , also know degenerative joint disease hyperostosis , common cause knee arthritis . Pain , dyskinesia disability induce osteoarthritis impact severely subject 's health quality life . Knee osteoarthritis common elderly population . As life expectancy increase , incidence osteoarthritis rise significantly 20th century . For people 60 year age , approximately 50 % show sign osteoarthritis x-ray , among 35 % -50 % show clinical sign . For people age 75 , 80 % osteoarthritis symptom . There increase import knee prosthesis past decade , surgeon choice implant . However , high cost import prostheses become barrier development TKA China cause many OA subject require immediate TKA delay miss surgery . The development promotion high-quality domestic joint implant surgical instrument key development TKA technique China . The primary objective study demonstrate non-inferiority subject implant TC-A PS total knee system compare randomized concurrent control group subject implant TC-PLUS Solution PS total knee system term Knee Society Clinical Score ( KSCS ) 1 year .</detailed_description>
