	<brief_summary>The overall objective study demonstrate dietary ganglioside may protect gut attenuate inflammatory signal intestinal mucosa . Gangliosides dietary fat find milk important constituent intestinal cell . Our previous study show inflamed intestinal mucosal cell reduce ganglioside content compare normal mucosal cell . Gangliosides glycolipids find surface intestinal mucosa lipid raft enterocytes lymphocyte . Gangliosides influence microbial attachment , cell division , differentiation , signal mucosal integrity . Preclinical study show provision ganglioside cell culture animal diet increase ganglioside content mucosal cell regulate signal cause pro-inflammatory stimulus . In subject active Crohn 's disease , consumption ganglioside remarkably improve Crohn 's Disease Activity Index . In healthy control subject , dietary ganglioside improve intestinal permeability decrease production pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 . It propose ganglioside degradation elevate inflamed gut IBD patient . Provision ganglioside diet replaces ganglioside gut , consequently restore proper structure function diseased intestine induce disease remission . Insight diet-based treatment would allow IBD patient live healthy happy life . The main research objective characterize ganglioside catabolism associate increase signal pro-inflammatory mediator reduction ganglioside level ameliorate ganglioside supplementation active inflammatory disease . This study ass molecular mechanism ganglioside alters gut permeability , inflammatory mediator cell signal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Objective 1 test dietary ganglioside treatment improve intestinal integrity , permeability systemic inflammation patient inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) . Objective 2 study bioavailability dietary ganglioside BACKGROUND &amp; SCOPE This pilot study conduct patient mild-moderate IBD assess Crohn 's disease activity index Mayo Score . Our study indicate ganglioside specie prevent proinflammatory stimuli prevent disruption integrity tight junction enterocytes , normalize transepithelial electrical resistance inflame cell . Feeding ganglioside rat prevent lipopolysaccharide-stimulated decrease cellular tight junction protein occludin . Low level GD3 ganglioside intestinal mucosa associate degradation tight junction protein . Increasing GD3 content intestinal mucosa thus reduce degradation tight junction protein improve integrity brush border improve deleterious change occur intestinal permeability . Improving intestinal integrity subject IBD important manage diarrhea , infection , penetration allergen , malnutrition . Research progress group demonstrate dietary ganglioside decrease level pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 healthy human subject Crohn 's disease . Also , daily consumption ganglioside effective improve Crohn 's disease activity index average 43 % eight-week study period . METHODS &amp; PROCEDURE Subject Recruitment Healthy control subject patient Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis recruit Edmonton University Alberta Hospital gastroenterology clinic . Male ( non-pregnant ) female adult ( &gt; 17 year age ) eligible study . Pre-operative IBD patient mild moderate disease include rectosigmoiditis , left-sided colitis , concurrent small bowel disease , Crohn 's recruit . Diagnosis base establish radiologic , endoscopic , histologic criterion . Dietary Treatment Ganglioside Ganglioside provide form ganglioside-enriched milk fat globule membrane . This buttermilk supernatant contain protein , lactose , 0.4 % ganglioside ( 75 % GD3 , 25 % GM3 ) . Normal preparation butter yield buttermilk . The ganglioside fraction use study centrifuge filter remove casein whey protein . Participants randomize consume either 1.0 g ganglioside placebo daily eight week addition standard drug treatment . The placebo milk fraction contain ganglioside , equal protein lactose content ganglioside fraction . Subject Involvement Participants blood drawn baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 8 supplementation study . Subject disease Activity Index Mayo Score obtain week 0 8 . Participants undergo non-invasive intestinal permeability test study week 0 8 .</detailed_description>
