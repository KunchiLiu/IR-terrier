	<criteria>Age : ≤ 21 year time diagnosis . Diagnosis : Histologic verification either time original diagnosis relapse neuroblastoma . Disease Status : For purpose study , aggressive multidrug chemotherapy define chemotherapy include 2 agent must include alkylating agent platinumcontaining compound . Patients must ONE following : First episode recurrent disease follow completion aggressive multidrug frontline therapy . First episode progressive disease aggressive multidrug frontline therapy . Primary resistant/refractory disease detect conclusion least 4 cycle aggressive multidrug induction chemotherapy accord highrisk neuroblastoma protocol ( example include Children 's Oncology Group trial : A3973 , ANBL0532 , ANBL09P1 , etc. ) . Measurable evaluable disease , include least one following : Measureable tumor CT MRI ; A positive MIBG PET scan ; Positive bone marrow biopsy/aspirate . Current disease state must one currently know curative therapy additional therapy prove prolong survival acceptable quality life . A negative urine pregnancy test require female subject child bear potential ( onset menses ≥13 year age ) . Organ Function Requirements : 1 . Subjects must adequate liver function define : AST ALT &lt; 5x upper limit normal Serum bilirubin must ≤ 2.0 mg/dl 2 . Subjects must adequate Bone Marrow function define : For patient without bone marrow involvement : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≤ 750/uL Platelet count 50,000/uL ( transfusion independent , define receive platelet transfusion within 7 day period prior enrollment . Exception : Patients platelet dependent due previous extensive treatment e.g . MIBG therapy ) . Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dL ( may receive RBC transfusion ) Patients know bone marrow involvement neuroblastoma eligible provide minimum ANC platelet count criterion meet evaluable hematological toxicity . Subjects must adequate renal function define : Serum creatinine base age/gender . Informed Consent : All subject and/or legal guardian must sign informed write consent . Assent , appropriate , obtain accord institutional guideline . Lansky score &lt; 50 % BSA ( m2 ) &lt; 0.25 Prior Therapy Patients must fully recover acute toxic effect prior anti cancer chemotherapy within follow timeline : 1 . Myelosuppressive chemotherapy : Must receive within 2 week enrollment onto study ( 6 week prior nitrosourea ) . 2 . Hematopoietic growth factor : At least 5 day since completion therapy growth factor . 3 . Biologic ( antineoplastic agent ) : At least 7 day since completion therapy biologic agent . For agent know adverse event occur beyond 7 day administration , period must extend beyond time adverse event know occur . The duration interval must discuss Study Chair . 4 . Immunotherapy : At least 6 week since completion type immunotherapy , e.g . tumor vaccine . 5 . Monoclonal antibody : At least 7 day 3 halflives , whichever longer , must elapse since prior treatment monoclonal antibody . 6 . XRT : At least 14 day since last treatment except radiation deliver palliative intent nontarget site . 7 .

Investigational Drugs : Subjects receive another investigational drug within last 14 day exclude participation . Infection : Subjects uncontrolled infection eligible infection judge well controlled opinion investigator . Subjects , opinion investigator , may able comply safety monitoring requirement study , compliance likely suboptimal , exclude .</criteria>
