When symptoms become apparent develop , may late confirmation infection congenital origin ; diagnosis congenital infection base detection CMV sample collect within 2 3 week birth . The presence CMV sample collect time may represent postnatal infection carry risk hearing loss neurodevelopmental sequela . Universal hear screen birth use otoacoustic emission ( OAE ) offer maternity France detect symptomatic hearing impairment birth screen cCMV infection couple screening . In study , feasibility achieve one month age diagnosis congenital CMV diagnosis well confirmation hearing loss newborn fail newborn hear screening test .</detailed_description>
