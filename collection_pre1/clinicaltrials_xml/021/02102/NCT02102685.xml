	<brief_summary>The presence deep abscess neck potentially severe , also lead death short term . The surgical treatment indicate commitment airway , critical condition , septicemia , complication , descendent infection , diabetes mellitus improve first 48 hour parenteral antibiotic treatment subsequent heal wound heals second intention . In study investigator propose use vacuum Assisted Closure ( VAC ) use satisfactorily reduce edema , promote granulation , ameliorate tissue afterwards reconstruct defect , increase vascularity diminish bacterial load .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vacuum Assisted Closure Neck Abscess</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To evaluate therapeutic efficacy combination vacuum-assisted comparison traditional therapy wound heal deep neck abscess . Material Methods Type Study : Clinical Trial ( Randomized ) control This project perform patient Service Otolaryngology , IMSS , diagnose deep neck abscess . Procedure There two group : Group A , 14 patient treated VAC therapy , group B , patient treat conventional therapy Group A : within first three day VAC therapy place , proceed follow : organize material , bandage removal , clean wound irrigation solution , cut sponge placement wound , use polyvinyl alcohol / silver foam , insertion tube seal connection contain recipient . Wound cleaning perform irrigating solution replacement sponge every 72 hour accord evolution , photograph take assess percentage viable tissue granulation . A Sample culture take prior placement VAC therapy , use time removal system . When wound present clinical sign improvement ( elimination purulent discharge granulation tissue ) VAC therapy withdrawn , follow delay primary closure . Patients assign group B : 14 patient admission , surgical drainage , culture take , photographs every three day ( hospital stay ) secretion culture ; daily cleaning stipulate service perform . The control patient make wound closure ( presence epithelialization tissue ) . Statistical Analysis Nominal variable analyze use percentage frequency , X2 test Fisher exact test . Numeric variable use Student 's test independent sample ANOVA post hoc Scheffe test . U Mann Whitney Kruskal Wallis test use long data conform normal distribution . All value p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . The analysis perform statistical program SPSS v. 18 Windows program .</detailed_description>
