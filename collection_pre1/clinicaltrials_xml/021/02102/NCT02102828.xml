	<brief_title>Multimodal DVT Protocol Tourniquet-less Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year significant progress towards effective practical thromboprophylaxis joint replacement surgery . Since Aspirin 325mg twice daily recently include nationally approve venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) prophylaxis Surgical Care Improvement Project ( SCIP ) protocols low risk total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) patient , necessary optimize multimodal prophylaxis method . These include reduce tourniquet time , early mobilization , mechanical compression device ( MCDs ) . MCDs commonly use part in-hospital VTE prophylaxis measure ; however , demonstrate clinical trial optimal prophylaxis method would enhance prolonged use MCD discharge . In order achieve , potentially valuable solution recently make available outpatient population . The Cothera VPulse ( tm ) MCD combine rapid intermittent sequential compression cold therapy . It design single patient use home include technology track patient compliance . The purpose study examine difference DVT occurrence 3 week tourniquet-less TKA multimodal prophylaxis without extend MCD use cool device/MCD system .</detailed_description>
