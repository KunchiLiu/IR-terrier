	<detailed_description>HIV prevention global public health priority . Providing efficacious prevention method great likelihood use profound impact public 's health . Critical use `` acceptability . '' However , current conceptualization adherence acceptability fail fully articulate account pattern use non-use . Formulation property critically important drug delivery user experience . Microbicide developers thus opportunity directly control formulation 's impact acceptability adherence product use , well biological product performance . Microbicide product develop achieve performance standard behavioral ( user experience ) biological ( efficacy ) function . By incorporate user experience early product development process , developer greatest chance provide at-risk individual best prevention method science provide . Developing prevention product use vagina and/or rectum optimize user experience compartment increase likelihood product use consistently correctly . The impact global public health potential far-reaching , decrease HIV sexually transmit infection ( STI ) incidence prevalence woman men . Methodology Data Collection : This formative mixed method design volunteer ( N~20-30 ; ~8-20 male ; ~8-20 Females ) first prescreened basic study eligibility use brief questionnaire . Those interested study eligible base response prescreen complete STI/HIV screening pregnancy test ( female ) . During course study , participant evaluate 3 study product ( i.e. , distinct semi-solid formulation represent range physicochemical rheological property ) . Each participant randomly assign order evaluate 3 product . Participants require complete brief phone survey ( &lt; 5 minute ) every day , begin day start first product evaluation period continue complete final study visit ( approximately 12-24 week ) . The phone survey include short set question sexual behavior product use time since last phone survey ( 24 hour ) . After sexual encounter include RAI study product use , participant require complete web survey experience study product . After participant evaluate three product , participant complete individual in-depth interview cognitive interview study staff experience study product USPE scale item develop .</detailed_description>
