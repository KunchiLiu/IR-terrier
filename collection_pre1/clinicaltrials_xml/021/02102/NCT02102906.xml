	<brief_summary>Functional motor disorder , also call motor conversion disorder , common reason attendance neurology outpatient clinic . Patients functional motor disorder common patient multiple sclerosis similar level disability psychological morbidity . There limited evidence effective treatment functional motor disorder . A small number study transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , painless method cortical stimulation , report improvement functional weakness treatment include patient symptoms several year duration . The Investigators intend trial TMS group 40 patient functional motor disorder , randomise patient immediate delay treatment therefore compare single session TMS routine clinical care . The Investigators also ask patient undergo test attentional focus cognitive neuroscience laboratory - experiment analyse separately TMS trial data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomised non-blinded control study design use , 3 month treatment usual control condition single session TMS treatment condition . 40 patient functional unilateral upper limb weakness recruit neurology neuropsychiatry clinic Edinburgh randomise either immediate treatment 3 month delay receive routine clinical care . Randomisation perform use computerised random number generator person involve study . Patients randomise delay complete baseline measure disability motor function include SF36 , modify Rankin score study specific questionnaire , repeat 3 month . Patients undergo immediate treatment complete questionnaire immediately 3 month treatment . All individual receive TMS treatment undergo test grip strength tap frequency immediately treatment . The treatment experiment involve follow . Patients attend PPLS Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory George Square , University Edinburgh single 2 hour session . During first hour complete baseline symptom severity disability questionnaire undertake series 3 experiment . Experiments involve participant sit head chin-rest look either computer screen light project onto hand , one experiment vibrate 'buzzer ' taped hand . They ask respond verbally experiment test response distract attentional 'cues ' either visual vibrotactile . These experiment take less 1 hour . In anaylsis , performance compare affect unaffected side ( ie leave hand right hand ) , also compare performance group 15 healthy control participant recruit spouse partner . Patient participant receive treatment 20 single pulse TMS motor cortex 120 % motor threshold . These cause visible palpable 'jerks ' affected limb . Between stimulation researcher offer verbal encouragement ask participant move affect limb possible . Treatment take less 1 hour . The primary outcome measure patient-rated symptom severity disability simple statistical analysis use compare outcome 3 month treatment normal 3 month single session TMS treatment . Secondary outcome measure include grip strength tap frequency treatment . Data analyse intention-to-treat basis . Data attentional test analyse separately .</detailed_description>
