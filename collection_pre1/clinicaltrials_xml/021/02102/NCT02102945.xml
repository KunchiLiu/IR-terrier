	<brief_title>Special Imaging Technique Aid Diagnosis Patients Coma After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest common associate poor survival despite intensive medical care . These patient subject cool therapy improve neurological outcome . After cool patient allow spontaneously return normal body temperature . From , outcome patient mainly dependent wait watch approach clinical examination patient coma limit . Despite attempt , 41 % patient die 55 % favourable neurological outcome . There clinical score system provide prognosis face cardiac arrest none address serious group- coma . For patient coma , medication , particularly suppress central nervous system , cause difficulty clinical assessment . Multiple ancillary test , routine CT MRI brain , give useful prognostic information . We hypothesize neurological outcome patient coma mainly dependent presence brainstem function . To best knowledge , study address issue brainstem function cardiac arrest patient . This may due fact image tool could confidently depict function brainstem . In recently perform study institution , use CT perfusion technique , demonstrate patient diffusely impaired brainstem perfusion poor prognosis survive . This study already consider World Health Organization modification criterion declaration brain death . We suggest similar imaging technique potentially useful prognosticate patient coma follow cardiac arrest . In present pilot study , propose determine perform CT perfusion scan post-cardiac arrest patient coma help prognosticate outcome patient . This may potentially help early withdrawal care patient significantly impaired brainstem function . If , significant impact patient care potentially huge financial implication health care system . Such early decision making may also help organ harvest suitable situation . This potentially improve quality life many terminally ill patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult patient ( age range : 1880 year ) , coma least 24 hour follow cardiac arrest admit cardiac intensive care unit recover body temperature back normal subject therapeutic hypothermia protocol include study . Also include patient whose next kin provide consent study . patient pregnant , impaired renal function , contraindication CT contrast medium ( know allergy anaphylactic reaction ) provide consent . Pregnant patient exclude avoid potential adverse effect radiation CT perfusion study develop foetus . A develop foetus vulnerable radiation compare adult patient . Patients 80 year exclude avoid age related comorbidities affect patient ' survival . We see patient 18 year age institution thus exclude .</criteria>
