	<detailed_description>Major Abdominal Surgery ( MAS ) may define surgical resection perform colorectal , hepato-pancreatico-biliary upper-GI organ either primary anastomosis and/or ostomy . In patient undergo MAS postoperative complication report 40 % patient . Around 20 % MAS patient major complication , require invasive treatment reoperation , percutaneous drainage intensive care admission . Major complication increase morbidity mortality major abdominal surgery , lead longer intensive care hospital stay , unplanned open procedure creation ostomy possible increased cancer recurrence rate cost . In current postoperative practice median time clinical diagnosis postoperative complication approximately eight day . A delay diagnosis complication increase morbidity mortality relate major complication . Whereas early diagnosis postoperative septic complication , clinical deterioration , associate decrease associate morbidity mortality . An early detection septic complication challenge may clinically serologically , well use image technique , hard distinguish physiological postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Furthermore clinical risk assessment appear low predictive value major complication anastomotic leak . This stress need standardize Quality Control algorithm MAS . Noteworthy nowadays standard Quality Control test protocol available MAS differentiate normal complicate postoperative course . In search marker early diagnosis postoperative complication several biomarkers assess , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , Tumour necrosis factor α ( TNF-α ) , procalcitonin , white blood cell count ( WBC ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) . WBC show significant difference patient uncomplicated versus complicate postoperative course . WBC therefore useful standardized quality control algorithm . Procalcitonin , IL-6 TNF-α assess marker postoperative sepsis . However , compare CRP achieve similar result predict major complication MAS . Moreover , take account high cost limited availability test procalcitonin , IL-6 TNF-α level , focus use CRP postoperative standardize quality control algorithm . CRP well establish marker infection complication show promising result . It acute phase protein , synthesize liver , stimulation IL-6 TNF-α inflammatory process , amongst others enhance phagocytosis bacteria macrophage . In healthy individual , CRP level &lt; 1 mg/L . In mild inflammation rapidly reach 40 mg/L even 400 mg/L detect severe inflammatory response , sepsis burn . CRP level also raise consequence operative trauma , even suggest level postoperative CRP proportional length operation , amount operative trauma intra-operative complication . A peak postoperative CRP level observe 48-72 hour surgery . In uneventful case , level decrease peak . Furthermore , plasma half-life CRP 19 hour independent diet , diurnal rhythm organ function . Circulating CRP level therefore determine rate synthesis . Based characteristic , CRP might promise valuable marker grade inflammation relate postoperative complication . Several study assess use CRP marker postoperative complication major abdominal surgery . Established cut-off CRP level serve marker infective complication range 140 mg/L 170 mg/L postoperative day ( POD ) 3 . Regarding anastomotic leakage colorectal patient , cut-off CRP level propose 190 mg/L POD 3and 125 mg/l POD 4 . Published variation cut-offs CRP level relate differ positive negative predictive value . The large retrospective series include 1187 patient undergone colorectal surgery . They calculate cut-off 123 mg/L marker septic complication , yet differentiate minor major complication . A recent meta-analysis establish cut-off 172 mg/l POD 3 marker anastomotic leakage . Definitions regard anastomotic leak vary widely among literature , limit reproducibility exclude patient require re-intervention complication . Therefore interest lie diagnose major complication require invasive treatment , classify grade 3-5 Clavien Dindo classification . Based systematic review pooled-analysis 1427 patient underwent MAS , level 140 mg/l propose cut-off postoperative day 3,4 5 marker major complication , overall sensitivity 81,7 % sensitivity 61,6 % Serum CRP non-specific location , thus additional imaging require . Computed Tomography ( CT ) current image modality choice . In retrospective data , CT-scans show sensitivity 91,7 % specificity 100 % diagnosis major complication , conform literature . Moreover , study conduct Eckmann et al . CT-scan imaging show sensitivity 97 % . Another recent study establish CT-scan imaging preferred modality diagnosis anastomotic leakage . In 2008 , Den Dulk et al . implement standardized scoring system clinical status patient undergo colorectal surgery . With system decreased time surgery diagnosis anastomotic leakage 8 6 day , thereby decrease mortality 39 % 24 % ( p=0,24 ) . Further support role standardize postoperative quality control algorithm follow MAS . However search optimal algorithm continue . CRP CT scan show able differentiate uncomplicated complicated postoperative course . Currently use demand . The presented PRECious protocol postoperative Quality Control algorithm , aim early diagnosis treatment patient major complication .</detailed_description>
