	<detailed_description>Rabbit antithymocyte globulin ( rATG ) approve treatment acute rejection follow kidney transplantation routinely administer series 5-7 consecutive daily dos via central intravenous catheter . This prolonged course consistent Medicare diagnosis-related group ( DRG ) acute rejection limit rejection admission 3 day . The prolonged hospitalization result increase medical cost uniform financial loss hospital patient admit DRG . In addition patient relate toll prolong hospitalization potential additional hospital acquire complication . Single large-doses rATG show equivalent safety efficacy profile compare standard daily protocol use induction agent report experience use rejection treatment . The investigator hypothesize single-dose rATG infusion safe efficacious standard rATG administration use rejection treatment would result significant reduction length hospital stay ( LOS ) hospital cost rejection treatment .</detailed_description>
