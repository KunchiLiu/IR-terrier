	<brief_summary>This program initially aim recruit 1300 breast cancer patient large number hospital across Europe . Eligible patient 18 old , either female male , receive 1 type treatment time metastasis discover , metastasi ( e ) diagnose disease come back ( disease relapse ) . Biopsy sample primary metastatic ( relapse ) tumor collect central analysis , together blood , serum plasma sample . Any sample analyze immediately stored independent bio-repository enable future ( yet define ) research aim well understanding metastatic breast cancer . In summary , main objective AURORA good understand genetic aberration metastatic breast cancer discover mechanisms response resistance therapy , order ultimately identify `` right therapy individual patient '' . At time , patient genetic aberration target new drug development offer possibility participate clinical trial , approve available country . Ultimately , aim AURORA improve outcomes patient diagnose metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
