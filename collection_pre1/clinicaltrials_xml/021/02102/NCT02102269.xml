	<brief_summary>Shoulder pain frequently report complication among stroke patient . Muscular imbalance disrupts stability glenohumeral joint create subluxation . Stretching soft tissue cause shoulder pain impedes quality life , length stay rehabilitation outcome . To align humeral head cavitas gleno√Ødalis shoulder orthosis often provide patient . Since use orthoses always consider positive patient therapist question rise investigator objectify subacromial space reduce wear sling . Sonography valid way asses subluxation shoulder joint measure subacromial space . To objectify orthosis reduce enlarge subacromial space investigator use sonography measure distance acromion great tuberosity acromion humeral head . This distance measure without orthosis also period least 4 hour wear orthosis . This last measurement might inform u long orthosis correct glenohumeral position . To validate sonographic measurement X-rays take sample investigator study population compare ultrasound data . Two different orthoses compare . First actimove sling , standardly use rehabilitation centre patient recruit . This sling adapted patient easy wear . The disadvantage elbow continuously flex , enlarge risk contracture m. biceps m. brachioradialis . Also negative influence interpretation body scheme quantitative use arm reason wear kind orthosis . The shoulderlift hand newly develop orthosis support shoulder joint arm extend . This normal position daily live stimulates use paretic arm . An extra adaptation adjust make possible position arm flex order reduce oedema hand necessary . The control group wear orthosis . Additional investigator evaluate passive range motion shoulder , spasticity upper limb ( modified ashworth scale ) , active motion upper limb ( fugl meyer assessment ) trunk stability ( Trunk Impairment Scale ) start point period 6 week wear orthosis minimal 6 hour day . If possible investigator evaluation balance move platform evaluation gait without orthosis 6 week assess impact balance gait .</brief_summary>
