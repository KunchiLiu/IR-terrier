	<brief_summary>1 . Clinical nutritional support therapy important progress modern medicine . 2 . Conventional method clinical nutrition assessment ( Anthropometric , lab , etc . ) lack accuracy immediacy also difficult dynamically reflect fluctuation trend nutrition status . 3 . It report malnutrition affect proliferation apoptosis human cell vivo . This preliminary study initiate hypothesis change nutritional status may reflect rapidly fast proliferating cell . 4 . In previous study investigator already find apoptosis rate oral mucosal epithelium could reflect change nutritional status.There obvious decrease apoptosis proliferation rate oral mucosal epithelium malnourish patient . 5 . Based patient 's curve apoptosis rate oral mucosal epithelium , plateau achieve increase nutrition amount continuously , Maintain amount nutrition give end treatment . The investigator call amount nutrition `` upper limit nutrition support therapy '' . 6 . The patient apply '' upper limit nutrition support therapy '' `` Formula nutrition support therapy '' separately , compare two method influence postoperative wound healing , postoperative complication rate , inflammatory response , side effect chemotherapy , hospital stay hospitalization expense .</brief_summary>
