Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp validate method assessment insulin resistance It also gold standard technique . However , complexity length technique render unsuitable routine clinical use . In study , investigator use new technique provide precise , objective , fast automated quantification insulin resistance camera SPECT . They compare result measurement hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp population without insulin resistance .

	<brief_title>Comparison A New Technique Measure Insulin Resistance By Scintigraphy With Reference Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , type II diabetes mellitus , reach epidemic level world . Moreover , prediction year 2030 even alarm . Insulin resistance , characterize depress cellular sensitivity insulin insulin-sensitive organ , central feature metabolic syndrome risk factor type 2 diabetes . Its appearance may precede diagnosis true diabetes several year . Insulin resistance result decrease membrane translocation GLUT-4 , whole molecular mechanism remain unclear . Currently , simple tool measure insulin resistance . The gold standard technique remain hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp . However , complexity length technique render unsuitable routine clinical use . Many method index propose assess insulin resistance human , none show enough relevance use clinical use . Moreover , clinical measurement focus whole-body glucose uptake , however accurate convenient procedure insulin resistance measurement organ would interest . Indeed increasingly evidence insulin resistance primary etiologic factor development nonischemic heart failure ( HF ) , another grow public health problem . Nuclear image provide interesting method measure insulin resistance use Positron Emission Tomographic ( PET ) tracer . Two glucose analog [ 18F ] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) [ 11Cl-30methyl-n-glucose ( 3-OMG ) use evaluate noninvasively cellular uptake glucose use PET technique several organ like heart , skeletal muscle blood-brain barrier , liver . [ 18F ] 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) , commonly use study glucose metabolism human , allow estimation glucose transport phosphorylation . A number kinetic modeling approach use quantitation glucose utilization rate use FDG . FDG transport phosphorylated native glucose , calculation glucose uptake metabolism require use correction factor process merge lumped constant . The major limitation approach quantification glucose metabolism require knowledge lump constant , factor , relate kinetic behavior FDG naturally occur glucose term relative affinity molecule trans-sarcolemmal transporter hexokinase . Unfortunately , value lump constant human different physiological pathophysiological condition varies , metabolic image PET need standardization metabolic condition hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp . 3-OMG appear ideal glucose analog probe transmembrane transport . However , due short half-life 11C ( t1/2 = 20 min ) , analog use clinical institution close proximity cyclotron access PET device . According knowledge , investigator develop original compound , [ 123I ] 6-deoxy-6-iodo-D-glucose ( 6DIG ) , tracer glucose transport equivalent 3-OMG , reference tracer . 6-DIG previously exploit measure IR vivo investigator transfer human measurement technique , perfectly validate animal . Previous , report first use potential single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) tracer study basal insulin-stimulated glucose transport non-invasively . In phase I development , use new nuclear probe use iodinated tracer glucose transport clinical application specific image processing ass cardiac insulinoresistance healthy diabetic subject . The result human subject show technique rapidly provide insulinoresistance index ( ratio scintigraphy measurement glucose transport heart infusion insulin ) simple procedure , open new opportunity screen pre-diabetic patient .</detailed_description>
