	<brief_summary>This prospective , open randomize phase III surgical trial seek study whether radical prostatectomy ( without combination external radiation ) improve prostate-cancer specific survival comparison primary radiation treatment hormonal treatment among patient diagnose locally advanced ( T3 ) prostate cancer . Untreated conservatively treat locally advanced prostate cancer associate high mortality . Modern curative treatment advance solid malign tumor include surgery and/or radiation plus attempted chemotherapy available achieve local control elimination potential micro metastasis . Whereas evidence surgery cure localize prostate cancer , clinical trial multi-modal treatment locally advanced prostate cancer include surgical removal prostate . One potential advantage add prostatectomy treatment LAPC remove prostate enables full pathological assessment tumor characteristic thus good estimation risk recurrence . Surgical treatment could thus reduce number need treat chemotherapy radiation , thus improve quality life treatment . In addition , evidence indicate residual cancer prostate occur 25 % radiation treatment ( 56 ) surgical removal prostate may improve survival beyond achieve radiation ADT . On hand , patient treat surgery , radiation hormone experience side effect three treatment modality might fare well radiotherapy plus hormone provide oncological control without prior surgery . A randomized clinical trial compare two multimodal treatment regimens one include radical prostatectomy therefore warrant .</brief_summary>
