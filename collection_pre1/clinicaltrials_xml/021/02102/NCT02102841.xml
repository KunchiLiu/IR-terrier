	<brief_title>Investigating Immune Mechanisms Atopic Eczema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atopic eczema chronic inflammatory skin disease affect 15-20 % child 12 % adult lead significant loss quality life . It result complex interaction genetic environmental factor , characterise dysregulation cutaneous immune system . Specifically , skin eczema patient persistence T lymphocytes ( crucial cell involve regulate immune system ) , overproduction certain cytokine ( signal molecule essential produce inflammatory response ) . The study intend investigate cause atopic eczema examine number , characteristic function T lymphocytes skin blood eczema patient , well type cytokine produce . To achieve investigator aim take skin biopsy , tissue fluid ( induced skin suction blister ) blood sample adult eczema patient healthy control analysis . Additionally , group cutaneous immune response initiate inject tuberculin protein purify derivative ( Mantoux test ) skin , investigate behaviour T lymphocytes varies eczema patient healthy control . This research important view high prevalence atopic eczema population . An improved understanding cause hopefully lead effective treatment condition future .</detailed_description>
