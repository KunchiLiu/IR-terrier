	<detailed_description>PTSD complex psychiatric disease characterize deficit fear extinction , hyperarousal , emotional numbing , intrusive symptom cause patient persistently re-experience traumatic event period longer month . PTSD consider chronic symptom present least six month . MDMA-assisted psychotherapy innovative experimental mode treatment combine psychotherapeutic technique administration MDMA . It may amplify certain aspect psychotherapy , pharmacological action MDMA think act adjunct psychotherapy . With positive result two study ongoing Phase 2 clinical study important characterize psychotherapeutic process occur treatment session conduct accord manualized method MDMA-assisted psychotherapy . Changes physiological status brain activity associate improvement recovery people chronic PTSD may offer mean assess treatment response rely less self-report . This may particularly important study MDMA-assisted psychotherapy blinding difficult due psychoactive nature investigational product . This study also interested identify categorize psychotherapeutic process take place MDMA-assisted psychotherapy . The sub-study also examine element experience self-report measure self-compassion . This exploratory sub-study identify psychotherapeutic process occur MDMA- assisted psychotherapy people chronic PTSD ass feasibility explore physiological correlate clinical outcome subject enrol ongoing clinical trial MDMA-assisted psychotherapy , NCT # : NCT01211405 . The sub-study conducted collaboration researcher Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) , Smith College New School Social Research . To support clinical outcome measure CAPS MP-8 study , sponsor interested correlation outcomes treatment-related change potential biological marker PTSD , measure HRV fMRI . Brain activity listen neutral personalize trauma-related script take place baseline experimental MDMA-assisted psychotherapy low medium full dose MDMA . The fMRI scan follow Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) scan . After scan session , pulse measurement extract digital data file HRV calculate . FMRI scan HRV measurement occur baseline participant condition , one month second experimental session final experimental session participant low medium dose condition , two month final experimental session participant full dose condition . Participants complete Self-Compassion Scale , self-report measure self-compassion Baseline final MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session . Psychotherapeutic process assess via observe psychotherapy sort set 100 therapy-related item mean describe interaction . Trained coder observe least one pre-drug psychotherapy session , one experimental ( drug-assisted psychotherapy ) session one post-drug psychotherapy session .</detailed_description>
