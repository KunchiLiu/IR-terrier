	<brief_summary>Age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) multifactorial disease strong genetic component . Given know impaired regulation choroidal vascular tone present patient AMD , current study seek investigate whether genetic polymorphism risk allele AMD associate altered choroidal blood flow regulation healthy subject . For purpose total 220 healthy volunteer include . Choroidal blood flow regulation evaluate measure choroidal blood flow isometric exercise . In addition , flicker induce vasodilatation study retinal vessel caliber assess , well retinal thickness macular pigment optical density .</brief_summary>
