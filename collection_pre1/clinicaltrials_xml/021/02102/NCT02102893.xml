	<brief_summary>Neuroendocrine tumor ( NETs ) neoplasms originate neuroendocrine cell locate throughout body . They secret various peptide cause various symptom ( carcinoid syndrome ) . The incidence NETs well-known till recently Yao et al . Hausa et al . publish survey NETs use data US Surveillance , Epidemiology , End Results ( SEER ) program Norwegian Registry Cancer ( NRC ) . The incidence NETs Taiwan use Taiwan Cancer Registry ( TCR ) data increase 0.3 1.51 per 100,000 1996 2008 . The increased incidence NET worldwide probably partially due awareness improvement diagnostic technology . Compared incidence western country , incidence NET much low Taiwan . And incidence NETs Asian Pacific Islanders also low white black US . Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs ( GEP-NETs ) , account half two third NETs , common site NETs . As progress understand pathophysiology GEP-NET , two novel target agent show effective treatment GEP-NET . Meanwhile , response mTOR inhibitor well Asian Caucasian phase III study use everolimus advance pancreatic NETs . These information suggest racial difference either genetic environmental risk factor factor result different incidence and/or clinical outcome . Currently , limit data thorough epidemiologic study Taiwan . The aim study collect clinical information GEP-NET , survey prognostic factor GEP-NET Taiwan . We suppose epidemiologic study would provide database potentially improve diagnosis , treatment GEP-NET . This study plan include 600 GEP-NET patient . NET patient diagnose 2011.1.1 include study . Furthermore , provide check immunohistochemical stain tumor tissue GEP-NET patient , include function status ( insulinoma , glucagonoma , gastrinoma , VIPoma ) degree differentiation , expression SSTR2 SSTR5 check possible primary site unknown primary NET patient . This examination provide accurate diagnosis patient treatment suggestion patient .</brief_summary>
