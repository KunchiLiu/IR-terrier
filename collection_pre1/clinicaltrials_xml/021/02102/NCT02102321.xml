	<brief_title>Does Treating Hookworm Improve Productivity Small Subsistence Farmers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DRC one world 's high prevalence ( frequency ) Soil Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) , group intestinal parasite include Ascaris , Trichuris hookworm , significant impact health nutritional status child . ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) In addition , hookworm , prevalence increase note adulthood many country relationship significant intestinal blood loss , also significant impact health nutritional status adult . Hookworm spread easily place without adequate control feces ; hookworm egg excrete feces infected people , transition larva , usually enter body skin bottom foot people wear footwear . Much hookworm 's health impact mediate intestinal blood loss hookworm attach human intestinal wall digest hemoglobin human red blood cell . That blood loss lead - exacerbate - iron deficiency eventually iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) . Because menstrual blood loss , large iron demand pregnancy , often low iron content diet , many woman childbearing age risk iron deficiency even without hookworm exposure . Any blood loss associate hookworm infection would exacerbate pre-existing iron deficiency . Iron deficiency without anemia also associate several study lower aerobic work capacity . IDA effect individual 's ability perform economic generating task ( work output ) threaten one 's livelihood possibly food security . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate annual loss 19.7 million disability-adjusted life year ( 1.3 % global total ) due IDA high burden Africa ( 25 % ) , area least afford . The median annual economic loss due IDA estimate 4 % gross domestic product 10 different develop country . Albendazole Mebendazole anti-helminthic drug cure reduce severity ( measure stool egg count ) many hookworm infection . The major programmatic use drug program school-based mass drug administration ( MDA ) recommend treatment strategy traditionally prioritize school-aged child . Large amount drug provide without charge manufacturer , Merck Johnson &amp; Johnson respectively , distribute W.H.O . ministry health support current goal control pediatric hookworm STH infection . Treatment hookworm infect group Albendazole show result increase hemoglobin level relate decrease prevalence anemia . Increases hemoglobin level due treatment also associate significant gain adult labor productivity measure Kenyan road construction worker ( 16 ) Bangladeshi woman plantation tea picker . However , cure amelioration hookworm infection cause drug permanent ; re-infection occur within week month heavily expose people . Few study measure work productivity beyond 2-3 month minimal information available long term treatment . This study response Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations RFP target specifically `` Labor Saving Strategies Innovations Women Smallholder Farmers . '' As hookworm endemic area think one primary cause IDA IDA know decrease work productivity , subsistence farmer ideally report improve productivity hookworm treat . Although benefit propose intervention directly target specific goal , i.e. , intend reduce amount necessary labor , benefit intervention could lead indirectly result ( ) increase woman 's ability accomplish fix amount work . The Democratic Republic Congo think appropriate location one world 's high burden NTD disease estimate 31 million hookworm case , second Nigeria disease prevalence Africa . The population also particularly vulnerable moderate heavy hookworm infection associate low hemoglobin level ( child adult ) thus great risk iron deficiency anemia . DRC also identify USAID country need urgent NTD disease surveillance control activity . Information study ideally extend understand disease process provide information regard inclusion anthelmintic treatment maternal public health package . Study Purpose The purpose study determine whether regular treatment woman smallholder farmer anti-hookworm drug Albendazole one-year period would impact work capacity possible productivity small farmer . The intention identify enroll intervention study group woman smallholder farmer pregnant first trimester pregnancy , acutely ill malaria , live area poor sanitation endemic hookworm . Many woman would presumably iron deficient , least part due blood loss associate hookworm infection . Study Aims 1 . To determine prevalence hookworm infection Safe Motherhood cohort 2 . To determine prevalence anemia Safe Motherhood cohort 3 . To determine change Hemoglobin female subsistence small farmer treat Albendazole daily iron supplementation 6 12 month . 4 . To determine change work tolerance measure STEP test female subsistence small farmer give Albenzazole iron supplementation 6 12 month</detailed_description>
