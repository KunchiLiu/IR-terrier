	<brief_title>A Study Systemic Chemotherapy With/Without HAI Patients With Initially Unresectable Colorectal Liver Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study experience prove efficacy safety systemic chemotherapy combine hepatic arterial infusion ( HAI ) floxuridine dexamethasone patient initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis . However , retrospective study , phase I II clinical research , could provide high-level evidence . Therefore , design study determine whether systemic chemotherapy combine HAI increase complete resection rate ( R0 ) improve overall survival patient initially unresectable colorectal liver metastasis .</detailed_description>
