	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine safety performance Agent™ Paclitaxel-Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter compare SeQuent® Please Paclitaxel-Releasing Coronary Balloon Catheter treatment patient narrow previously-stented coronary artery ( in-stent restenosis ) . The performance determine six month post-procedure quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) measure Late Lumen Loss ( LLL ) re-opened stented segment . QCA result assess independent , blind angiographic core lab . Study statistical hypothesis : The loss in-stent luminal diameter six month treatment restenosed stent Agent™ study device large respective LLL treatment SeQuent® Please control device , i.e . study device non-inferior control device respect LLL .</brief_summary>
