	<detailed_description>There evidence computer-administered cognitive training improve ADHD work memory deficit type train non-ADHD enhances normal work memory ability alter brain activity prefrontal cortex parietal lobe . However , study characterize brain activity change follow work memory train ADHD understand neural change occur cognitive deficit remedied . This R21 exploratory study examine neural basis cognitive training treatment gain work memory , ADHD symptom , various executive ability . The study compare n=21 ADHD adolescent evidence baseline deficit work memory ( i.e. , &lt; 1.5 SD normative rating baseline ) work memory training . Participants undergo baseline neuropsychological fMRI image verbal visuospatial Sternberg fMRI work memory task , 5 week daily computerize work memory training , endpoint fMRI cognitive evaluation neural behavioral change . Training utilize commercially-available Cogmed software ( http : //www.cogmed.com ) well-developed set computerized tool , numerous practical advantage study . Our analysis identify brain region ADHD adolescent affect work memory treatment characterize pattern activation change baseline endpoint . We examine post-treatment difference extent activation functional connectivity among activated brain region test hypothesis possible neural mechanism underlie treatment gain . Finally , conduct series analyse determine change brain function underlie generalized effect work memory training ADHD symptom 'executive ' ability . By identify neural correlate effect , study could yield invaluable information neural target effective ADHD treatment must . The key accomplishment exploratory study characterize neural basis treatment gain ADHD test theoretically-guided hypothesis possible neuroplastic change . The result support large , future study aim well understanding neural basis alternative treatment ADHD , identify biological genetic factor might denote presence remediable work memory deficit , ultimately achieve well understanding etiology ADHD work memory deficit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants 1317 year old &gt; 6th grade English reading level complete selfreport evaluation ( available English ) . ADHDC participant must meet DSMIV criterion ( 314.01 ) . Head injury sufficient cause &gt; 30 minute lose consciousness ; past current CNS disease ( e.g . stroke , MS , epilepsy repeat seizure history , tumor , etc ) brain lesion identify MR ( structural MR scan review radiologist presence clinical neuropathology may affect cognitive task performance ) ; Axis I DSMIV lifetime history Bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder , OCD , PTSD , Tourette 's disorder , Pervasive developmental disorder ( e.g. , Autistic disorder , PDD NOS , etc . ) ; current DSMIV substance dependence , Major Depressive Disorder anxiety disorder ; hypertension juvenileonset diabetes ( current treatment antihypertensive insulin ) ; current pregnancy ( menstruate female test ) ; IQ estimate &lt; 80 ; lefthandedness ; psychotropic medication common psychostimulants act primarily dopamine neurotransmission system . For instance , ADHDC medication Wellbutrin ( Buproprion ) , Strattera ( Atomoxetine HCl ) , Cylert ( Pemoline ) , Provigil ( Modafinil ) exclude participation ; report psychotic illness first degree relative . Note , current DSMIV disorder serve exclusionary criterion avoid possibility acute brain activity difference relate greatly disorder ADHD . These stringent exclusion criterion advantage many previous ADHD study . However , give frequent comorbidity suspect biological liability among ADHD , substance , mood , anxiety disorder , lifetime history mood anxiety disorder exclude participation . Likewise , frequent occurrence CD/ODD specific learn disability exclude participation .</criteria>
