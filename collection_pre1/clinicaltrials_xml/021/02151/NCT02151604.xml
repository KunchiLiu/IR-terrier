	<brief_summary>Lung cancer second commonly diagnose cancer United Kingdom , account 22 % cancer death . The main treatment lung cancer surgery , radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy . Current method , assess lung function lung cancer patient i.e . spirometry gas transfer inadequate . We aim develop new technique capable describe regional lung abnormality use hyperpolarized xenon gas MRI . The study involve 50 patient diagnosed lung cancer consider suitable radical radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy . Participants offer hyperpolarized Xe129 MR baseline , two week commencement radiotherapy schedule four followup visit one year posttreatment . Patients undertake extensive study measure baseline followup visit , include chest CT scan , ventilation/perfusion nuclear medicine scan , gadolinium enhance MRI scan , pulmonary function test , breathlessness score , radiotherapy induce lung toxicity assessment exercise test . Participation full test take day , allow patient time rest test allow period observation follow final hyperpolarized xenon scan . The investigator correlate baseline hyperpolarized Xe129 MR image spirometry breathlessness score determine tolerance radiotherapy well predict hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging . The investigator evaluate change hyperpolarized Xe129 MR image radiotherapy ( RT ) determine provide well monitor response compare spirometry . The study take place Churchill Hospital , Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Trust fund National Institute Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre . Hyperpolarized Xe129 MR image potential inform individual suitability radiotherapy schedule well investigation use currently . In addition , hyperpolarized Xe129 MR image potential well monitor treatment response improve detection radiation induce lung injury , invaluable treat patient radiation induced injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Survival rate lung cancer poor . One year survival rate United Kingdon males 27 % female 30 % , fall less 10 % five year . Prognosis lung cancer poor two third patient diagnose late stage curative treatment possible . Early diagnosis assessment tolerance curative treatment would make significant difference survival rate . Histologically , approximately 80 % lung cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The main curative treatment NSCLC surgery . Radical radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy potentially curative treatment . These suitable patient present localized tumour surgically unresectable due involvement critical local structure medically inoperable disease due advance age comorbidities . Radiotherapy aim deliver high tumouricidal dose tumour without damage surround normal lung tissue . A high dose radiotherapy improve local control incurs risk induce toxic effect normal lung tissue . If radiationinduced lung toxicity could well predict monitor , radical radiotherapy could tailor individual , could also benefit avoid reduce radiation dose functional lung tissue . Currently assessment patient radiotherapy involve lung function measurement provide clinical indicator whether patient would tolerate treatment maintain sufficient functioning lung posttreatment continue activity daily live without significant impairment . The current gold standard assessment lung function spirometry gas transfer . Spirometry gas transfer measure global lung function provide information different region lung regard support 'framework ' lung , parenchyma.Changes lung function measure spirometry gas transfer coherently correlate symptom severity reflect decline patient health . This weak relationship probably lung complex regional organ localize disturbance variety factor include gas flow ( ventilation ) , blood flow ( perfusion ) gas transfer combine impair respiratory function . To address issue aim use hyperpolarized xenon gas ( Xe129 ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) describe detailed regional structural lung abnormality patient NSCLC . The investigator correlate technique baseline spirometry dyspnoea score determine respiratory tolerance radiotherapy well predict hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging . The investigator compare hyperpolarized Xe129 MRI standard imaging ( nuclear medicine scan ) . The investigator also evaluate change hyperpolarized Xe129 MR imaging , radiotherapy determine provide improved assessment radiationinduced lung injury . MRI advantage free ionizing radiation make safe practical disease like lung cancer repeat followup scan necessary . MR image enhance speed image acquisition compare CT lung scintigraphy offer potential dynamic assessment lung respiration . In conventional MRI , signal originates principally proton water molecule tissue . Therefore conventional MRI limit use respiratory disease lung low density proton , instead largely composed air space generate MR signal . Hyperpolarised noble gas resolve problem . Xenon ( Xe129 ) unreactive inert noble gas . It nuclear spin Â½ enable use MR image generate signal . Xe129 hyperpolarized , say nuclear spin within atom increase . Hyperpolarization increase MR signal enable Xe129 gas show MR scan . In portion lung good airflow , hyperpolarized Xe129 gas show see quickly . In addition Xe129 readily dissolve blood emits different MR signal characteristic . This property may exploit regionally quantify ventilation perfusion within lung provide comprehensive assessment lung function . The need improve functional imaging identify preexist lung disease predict respiratory tolerance patient NSCLC radiotherapy treatment clear . Hyperpolarized Xe129 MR image potential inform individual suitability radiotherapy schedule well investigation use currently . In addition improve functional imaging require monitor treatment response enable treatment regime tailor individual . Hyperpolarized Xe129 MR image offer potential improve detection radiationinduced lung injury , invaluable treat patient radiation induced injury . It may also provide information would allow RT planned way reduce risk patient develop radiationinduced lung toxicity ( RILT ) .
