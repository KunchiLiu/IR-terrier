	<brief_title>Magnesium Metabolic Syndrome : A Dose-response Meta-analysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Increasing evidence suggest inadequate magnesium intake low serum magnesium concentration may correlate metabolic syndrome . However , whether dietary circulate magnesium usual intakes concentration influence risk metabolic syndrome inconsistent Objective : To knowledge , epidemiological evidence relation dietary magnesium intake risk metabolic syndrome yet summarized.Therefore , improve evidence-based guidance dietary guideline , investigator perform systematic review dose-response meta-analysis ass association dietary circulate magnesium level risk metabolic syndrome . Design : The planning , conduct report propose meta-analyses follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data search screening : The PubMed , Cochrane CENTRAL , EMBASE databases via Elsevier search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Published article include : Randomized , controlled study , case-control study , cross-sectional study cohort study . All study enrol adult ( age 18 year ) report metabolic syndrome outcome interest magnesium intake serum magnesium concentration risk factor intervention . They report adjust risk ratio , include odds ratio , relative risk , hazard ratios 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) , report sufficient data calculate value 3 quantitative category dietary magnesium intake level . They report risk ratio metabolic syndrome criterion accord National Cholesterol Education Panel ( NCEP ) , modify NCEP , American Heart Association/National Heart Lung Blood Institute , harmonize definition . The investigator select article write English publish entirety . Data extraction : Titles and/or abstract study retrieve use search strategy screen independently two review investigator identify study potentially meet inclusion criterion outline . The full text potentially eligible study retrieve independently assess eligibility two investigator disagreement resolve consensus . Data extract multivariate-adjusted model . Extracted information include : first author 's surname , publication year , name cohort study , study location ( nation ) , year follow-up ( case cohort study design ) , sex , age , sample size ( prevalence metabolic syndrome total number participant ) , dietary magnesium intake ( mg/day ) , serum magnesium concentration , covariates adjust multivariable analysis , risk ratio 95 % confidence interval category dietary magnesium intake serum magnesium concentration . The investigator extract risk ratio reflect great degree adjustment potential confounders . The study investigator ass risk bias include study use tool assess risk bias nonrandomized study ( RoBANs ) contain follow eight domain : comparability group , selection participant , confound variable , measurement exposure , blind outcome assessment , adequacy outcome assessment , incomplete outcome data selective outcome reporting . Domains RoBANs follow characteristic : Comparability group : Selection bias cause inadequate selection comparable group . Selection participant : Selection bias cause inadequate selection participant . Measurement exposure : Performance bias cause inadequate confirmation consideration confound variable . Blinding outcome assessment : Detection bias cause inadequate blinding outcome assessment . Incomplete outcome data : Attrition bias cause inadequate handling incomplete outcome data . Selective outcome reporting : Reporting bias cause selective reporting outcome . Adequacy outcome assessment : Performance bias cause inadequate confirmation outcome . RoBANS develop use assessment study design except randomize controlled study . RoBANS include criterion judge risk bias domain . Any discrepancy check study investigator . A final copy form trial check appropriate trial investigator verification . Outcomes : The investigator perform two stage random-effects dose-risk meta-analysis examine linear dose-response relationship dose magnesium intake metabolic syndrome use generalize least-squares method take account random effect . This method construct covariance estimate dose-specific log relative risk ( RRs ) within study estimate dose-response relation , account between- within-study variation . Reported hazard ratio odds ratio assume approximate RRs . For dose-response meta-analysis , The investigator generalize least-squares regression ( GLST ) , take account correlation estimate different expose level , compute study-specific slope . This method require number case control ( person-years ) RR variance estimate least three quantitative exposure category know . For study dose provide information , investigator estimate dose-response slope use variance-weighted least-squares regression ( VWLS ) . Both method ( GLST VWLS ) require median mean intake category intake level . For study report concentration range magnesium intake , investigator estimate midpoint category calculate average low upper bound . If upper boundary high category provide , investigator assume boundary amplitude adjacent category . When low category open-ended , investigator set low boundary amplitude adjacent category . In case different categorization magnesium intake serum concentration across study , investigator choose low level reference category . Dose responses dietary magnesium intake standardize base unweighted median difference high low quartile category median across study . For meta-analysis , statistical heterogeneity study assess use Q I-squared statistic . For Q statistic , heterogeneity consider present p &lt; 0.1 . The investigator define low , moderate high heterogeneity I-squared value 25 % , 50 % 75 % , respectively . Publication bias evaluate use Begg 's test . In presence publication bias , P value Begg 's test le 0.05 . The investigator conduct sensitivity analysis evaluate potential source heterogeneity analysis . The investigator conduct subgroup meta-analyses accord study design ( cross-sectional study , cohort cohort nest case-control study ) , study quality , definition metabolic syndrome , gender , age , geographic area study</detailed_description>
