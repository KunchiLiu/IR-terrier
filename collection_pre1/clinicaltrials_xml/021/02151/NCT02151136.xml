	<brief_title>Be Sweet Toddlers : Does Sugar Water Reduce Pain During Blood Work ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Hospitalized child child undergo medical care outpatient frequently require undergo needle-related procedure , venipuncture diagnostic purpose ongoing monitoring ( Ellis , Sharp , Newhook , &amp; Cohen , 2004 ) . This procedure cause considerable pain distress , especially young child ( Humphrey , Boon , van Linden van den Heuvell , &amp; van de Wiel , 1992 ) . Children rate needle distress aspect hospitalization ( Kortesluoma &amp; Nikkonen , 2006 ; Kortesluoma &amp; Nikkonen , 2004 ) , yet frequently perform skin-breaking procedure hospitalize child ( Cummings , Reid , Finley , McGrath , &amp; Ritchie , 1996 ; Ellis , et al. , 2004 ; Rennick , McHarg , Dell'Api , Johnston , &amp; Stevens , 2008 ; Stevens et al. , 2011 ) . It estimate one-quarter adult develop fear needle , likely develop childhood ( Taddio et al. , 2010 ; Wright , Yelland , Heathcote , Ng , &amp; Wright , 2009 ) . Being afraid needle increase risk avoidance needle immunization medical care ( Taddio et al. , 2009 ; Wright , et al. , 2009 ) . It therefore crucial health care researcher clinician determine effective pain management strategy young child , consistently use strategy clinical care . Rationale : There paucity evidence support efficacy feasibility pain management strategy needle-related painful procedure young child , uncertainty exist regard analgesic effect sweet solution beyond infancy . Objectives : The primary objective study ascertain whether evidence efficacy oral 24 % sucrose ( TootSweet , Natural Product Number ( NPN ) 80021492 ) toddler ( age 12 36 month ) compare placebo ( water ) venipuncture , measure pain score cry duration . Methods : A single-centre , phase IV , blind , two-armed randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Study population : Children age 12 36 month , inpatient surgical/medical ward urban pediatric tertiary care centre require venipuncture purpose medically-required venous blood sampling . Sample size : Data 140 toddler ; 70 randomize receive sucrose 70 randomize receive water . Data collection : Enrolled child video-recorded procedure order permit completion primary outcome measurement later date researcher blind study solution part data collection process . Statistical analysis : The primary analysis consist two-way ANOVA main effect intervention group age group . As secondary analysis , interaction intervention age group test . The primary analysis adapt include adjustment number previous hospitalization length current hospitalization number venipuncture attempt .</detailed_description>
