	<brief_title>Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics DCBCI0901 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open label , first human study design evaluate safety , tolerability PK escalating dos DCBCI0901 patient advance solid tumor . Each treatment cycle 28 day duration gap cycle . During cycle , DCBCI0901 administer slowly 30 minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion ( use infusion pump prefer ) daily ( QD ) first 5 day dose period ( Days 1 5 ) , follow 9 day recovery observation ( Days 6 14 ) . DCBCI0901 administer intravenously QD second 5 day dose period ( Days 15 19 ) , follow 9 day recovery observation ( Days 20 28 ) . Patients may continue receive treatment 28 day cycle completion Cycle 1 . To qualify continued treatment beyond Cycle 1 , follow criterion must fulfil : - The patient willing receive treatment - Toxicity induce IP consider unbearable judged Investigator - The patient PD define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors - The patient satisfies criteria dose - The patient meet criterion withdrawal After first cycle , CT/MRI assessment perform every 8 week ( 2 cycle ) efficacy evaluation , per Investigator judgment . After first year treatment , Investigator ass patient use CT/MRI base his/her discretion . Safety data evaluate accord normal practice . Upon discontinuation study treatment ( applicable ) , assessment Early termination visit ( discontinuation occur Cycle 1 ) End Treatment visit ( discontinuation occur Cycle 2 onwards ) occur within 3 day discontinuation . Assessments Follow visit ( 10 day [ ±1 day ] last dose IP ) End Study ( EOS ) visit ( 30 day [ ±3 day ] last dose IP )</detailed_description>
