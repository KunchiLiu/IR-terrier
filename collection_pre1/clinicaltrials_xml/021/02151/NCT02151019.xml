	<detailed_description>Pre-operative radiotherapy ( RT ) chemo-radiotherapy ( CRT ) internationally accept standard practice management locally advanced rectal cancer . Multiple randomise trial prove pre-operative CRT RT , compare surgery alone , reduce local recurrence , even prior optimal surgery , may improve survival T3 circumferential resection margin ( CRM ) negative patient . This study aim determine 3-DCRT IMRT result low incidence grade 2 GI toxicity . Acute toxicity assess weekly radiotherapy , 2 4 week post treatment . Late toxicity assess 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 month post treatment , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
