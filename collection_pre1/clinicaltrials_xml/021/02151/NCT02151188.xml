	<brief_title>Liquid Protein Preloads With Different Carbohydrate Types Effects Glycaemic Insulinaemic Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Consumption milk proteins increase satiety reduce glucose response consume alone carbohydrate . Milk proteins interest protein satiate either carbohydrate fat , regulate food intake metabolic function intact protein , encrypt peptide amino acid gastrointestinal central pathway . White rice white bread two common carbohydrate type mostly consume Asia . Both know result high glycaemic insulinaemic response . However , meal , accompany food soy milk , cow milk product . The glyceamic insulinaemic response determine type protein type carbohydrate . And also consumption time protein carbohydrate . Recent research point intrinsic value small amount milk protein dairy consume shortly meal reduce glycemic response carbohydrate cost increase demand insulin . The objective present study investigate glycaemic , insulinaemic satiety response white rice white bread meal change soy milk cow milk consume together shortly meal . Whole soy milk whole cow milk add meal . Healthy subject ( n 15 ) ingest test meal . The meal provide breakfast , 10 different occasion , random order â‰¥ 7 day . Blood sample ( cannula finger prick ) draw 3 h , glucose serum insulin , plasma glucagon , satiety marker , inflammation marker , amino acid et.al analyse . The objective study determine different liquid protein consume shortly carbohydrate different effect metabolism . And also compare difference white rice white bread . Determining consuming time effect , milk protein type carbohydrate type glycaemic insulinaemic critical provision dietary advice formulation public health guideline .</detailed_description>
