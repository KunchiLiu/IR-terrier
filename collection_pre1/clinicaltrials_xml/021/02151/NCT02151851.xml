	<brief_title>A Study Certolizumab Pegol Additional Therapy Chinese Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 3 , multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group , randomize , 24-week study evaluate safety efficacy Certolizumab Pegol ( CZP ) additional medication Methotrexate ( MTX ) Chinese subject active Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) incomplete response Methotrexate . This study design determine whether CZP 400 mg Weeks 0 , 2 , 4 follow CZP 200 mg every 2 week ( Q2W ) combination MTX demonstrate superiority , term great improvement relief sign symptom RA , compare MTX alone . Approximately 535 subject screen randomize 400 subject study , approximately 25 center People 's Republic China . There 2 treatment group , 300 subject CZP+MTX group 100 subject PBO+MTX group . For subject , study duration last maximum approximately 38 week . Subjects complete study RA0044 subject fail achieve American College Rheumatology 20 % Response Criteria ( ACR20 ) response Week 12 confirm Week 14 thus withdrawn study Week 16 , permit receive treatment CZP open-label extension study , RA0078 . The secondary objective assess dose regimen CZP combination MTX compare MTX alone safety tolerability , ability improve physical function , health outcome measure Chinese subject active RA ; also characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile immunogenicity CZP combination MTX .</detailed_description>
