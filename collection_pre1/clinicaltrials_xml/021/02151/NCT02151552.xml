	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn basic response lung inflammation use positron emission tomography , PET , image scan lung . PET machine detect radiation generates picture use donut-shaped scanner similar appearance x-ray `` CAT '' compute tomography ( CT ) scan MRI . Inflammation way body react irritation injury , involve red , warm , often painful swell affected tissue . An enzyme call inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) contribute development lung inflammation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing NOS Uptake With PET Imaging Lung Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan use three radioactive tracer produce PET image measure lung inflammation : [ 18F ] ( +/- ) NOS ( F stand fluorine NOS stand Nitric Oxide Synthase , target iNOS ) , O-15 carbon monoxide ( [ 15O ] CO ) , O-15 water ( [ 15O ] H2O ) . The NOS tracer give information specifically lung inflammation , carbon monoxide water tracer give information whether lung inflammation cause blood water retain area lung inflammation . In order show [ 18F ] ( +/- ) NOS-PET related amount inflammation , investigator first need create state control lung inflammation measure quantified . `` Controlled lung inflammation '' mean reaction lung similar occurs lung infection ( increased respiratory secretion cough ) . It `` controlled '' investigator use anything alive contagious ( spread one part body another , spread another person ) , small area one lung affect . In order create state control lung inflammation , investigator plan place small amount purify bacterial substance call endotoxin single small section lung use bronchoscope ( long , flexible narrow tube pass mouth airway lung ) . This use endotoxin consider investigational , investigator receive permission FDA use endotoxin research study .</detailed_description>
