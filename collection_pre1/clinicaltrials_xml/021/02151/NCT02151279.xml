	<detailed_description>Hypersensitivity reaction wine rarely report literature , mainly attribute grape protein [ 1 ] , biogenic amine , salicylate , sulfites yeast [ 2,3 ] . However , wine production traditionally involve fining , ingredient tannins remove co-precipitation protein derive milk ( casein , potassium caseinate ) , egg ( ovalbumin , lysozyme ) , fish ( isinglass ) shrimp ( chitosan ) . These protein derive animal source know play role food allergy . This increasingly prevalent health problem Western country [ 4,5 ] may manifest life-threatening anaphylactic shock presence trace allergen . Recently , safety wine-fining agent derive milk , fish egg establish [ 6 ] . However , chitosan , study safety fin agent allergic patient perform . Chitosan use fin agent mead wine industry electrostatic positive charge . Chitosan obtain deacetylation Chitin [ C8H13NO5N ] n , derivative glucose , one common polymer find nature . It main component cell wall fungi , exoskeleton arthropod crustacean insect , radulae mollusk , beak cephalopod , include squid octopus [ 7 ] . Seafood play important role human nutrition health , Portugal European country second high consumption [ 4 ] . The prevalence crustacean allergy seem vary largely geographical location , seem common Portugal [ 8 ] . The major shellfish allergen tropomyosin although allergen may play important part allergenicity . The possibility allergic reaction attribute trace chitosan use fining agent wine rule , particularly shrimp allergic patient small trace potential allergen may enough trigger anaphylactic reaction . Our aim , therefore , establish safety wine contain chitosan patient severely allergic shrimp [ 9 ] . Potential Risks Several study publish literature evaluate safety skin test , mostly use commercial extract . Prick-tests native food , call prick-to-prick test , less extensively study . The CICBAA1 data , 1,138 food allergic patient age , cover 34,905 prick-to-prick test food . The risk systemic reaction evaluate 0.008 % [ 10 , 11 ] . The negative predictive accuracy skin prick test food uniformly high . A negative skin test confirm absence IgE-mediated reaction 90 95 % accuracy [ 12,13 ] . Therefore , skin test highly useful exclude IgE-mediated food allergy . However , positive , test , evaluate sensitization clinical allergy , without pitfall , result must confirm oral challenge avoid over- diagnosis . The double-blind , placebo-controlled , oral food challenge ( DBPCFC ) consider gold standard diagnose food allergy prefer research purpose [ 14 ] . The overall level risk associate food challenge examine . A retrospective series review 584 OFCs perform child estimate â‰¤50 % risk reaction . Forty-three percent challenge positive . Thirty-nine percent reaction mild , 33 % moderate , 28 % severe . The type incidence different reaction cutaneous ( 78 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 43 % ) , oral ( 26 % ) , low respiratory ( 26 % ) , upper respiratory ( 25 % ) . No patient cardiovascular symptom [ 15 ] . Participants positive negative skin test proceed oral challenge , sensitization linear correlation clinical allergy . Although risk positive reaction oral challenge fin wine chitosan low ( severe seafood allergy usually mediate major shellfish allergen tropomyosin , present chitosan ) , safety purpose challenge perform appropriate setting , CPR support available , medication doctor present time . Potential Benefits It allow patient shellfish allergy inform safely ingest wine . Furthermore , need public health measure information could include wine label . STUDY OBJECTIVES To investigate safety chitosan , wine fining agent , patient severe allergy shrimp . Primary Outcome : Result DBPCFC chitosan fin wine .</detailed_description>
