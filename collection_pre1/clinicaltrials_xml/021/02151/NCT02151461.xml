	<detailed_description>This randomize , 4-week , active-controlled , double-blind study evaluate effect various fixed-dose combination leucine metformin compare standard metformin monotherapy glycemic control . In study , standard metformin therapy define 1000 g/day Day 1 Day 14 escalate 1700 g/day Day 15 Day 28 . Subjects meet inclusion criterion exclusion criterion randomize one four treatment arm . The primary objective study evaluate change fast plasma glucose Baseline ( Day 1 ) Week 4 ( Day 28 ) subject receive various fixed-dose combination leucine metformin compare standard metformin monotherapy . Secondary objective also assess change baseline-corrected plasma glucose insulin area concentration curve baseline day 28 change insulin secretory rate assess 3-hour meal tolerance test . Finally effect gastrointestinal symptom assess subject questionnaire . The study include total 3 period : screen washout current diabetic monotherapy , pre-treatment period ensure subject compliant , treatment period 4 week , first dose medication day 1 study . Each day blood glucose reading measure recorded patient . Three-hour standardized meal test perform Baseline ( Day 1 ) Study Termination ( Day 28 ) .
