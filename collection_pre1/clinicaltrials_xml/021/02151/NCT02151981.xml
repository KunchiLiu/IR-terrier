	<brief_title>AZD9291 Versus Platinum-Based Doublet-Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase III , open label , randomize study assess AZD9291 ( 80 mg , orally , daily ) versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy ( standard care ) subject confirm diagnosis Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) mutation positive NSCLC , progress follow prior therapy approve Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) agent whose tumour harbour T790M mutation within EGFR Gene . Subjects must chemotherapy naive must agree provide biopsy central confirmation T790 mutation status follow confirm disease progression first line EGFR-TKI treatment ( e.g . erlotinib , gefitinib afatinib ) . Suitable subject randomize receive either AZD9291 ( 80mg orally , daily ) platinum-based doublet chemotherapy ( pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + carboplatin area plasma concentration-time curve AUC 5 pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m2 ) Day 1 every 21-day cycle 2:1 ( AZD9291 : platinum-based doublet chemotherapy ) ratio . Once subject platinum-based doublet chemotherapy arm determine objective radiological progression accord RECIST 1.1 investigator confirm independent central image review , give opportunity begin treatment AZD9291 80mg , daily . These subject may continue treatment AZD9291 even disease progression , long continue show clinical benefit , judge investigator . The primary objective study assess efficacy AZD9291 compare platinum-based doublet chemotherapy assessment Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) , use investigator assessment accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST 1.1 ) , well asensitivity analysis Progression Free Survival use Blinded Independent Central Review ( BICR ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects histologically cytologically document NSCLC . Locally advance metastatic NSCLC Radiological documentation disease progression follow 1st line EGFR TKI Treatment without treatment Eligible receive treatment select doubletchemotherapy Central confirmation T790M+ mutation status World Health Organization ( WHO ) performance status 01 At least one lesion , previously irradiate . â€¢ Prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy treatment within 6 month prior start 1st EGFR TKI treatment Treatment one prior line treatment advance NSCLC Treatment approve EGFRTKI ( e.g. , erlotinib , gefitinib , afatinib ) within 8 day approximately 5x halflife first dose study treatment Any investigational agent anticancer drug previous treatment regimen clinical study within 14 day first dose study treatment Previous treatment AZD9291 , 3rd generation EGFR TKI For subject crossover AZD9291 : Once subject platinumbased doublet chemotherapy arm determine objective radiological progression accord RECIST 1.1 investigator confirm independent central image review . At least 14 day since last dose platinumbased doublet chemotherapy</criteria>
