	<brief_title>The Breast Surgery EnLight LightPath Imaging System Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single centre , pilot study assess feasibility EnLight LightPath Imaging Systems intra-operative analysis tumour margin axillary lymph node breast conserve surgery ( BCS ) breast cancer . Female patient diagnosis invasive breast cancer DCIS schedule BCS +/- sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) screen , enrol study eligible willing give write informed consent . BCS Subjects schedule BCS receive 5 MBq/kg 18F-FDG , maximum 300 MBq . 18F-FDG administer intravenously Nuclear Medicine Department , 60-180 minute prior EnLight LightPath imaging . After resection , WLE specimen examine LightPath Imaging System . The WLE specimen image EnLight Imaging System . The LightPath Imaging System locate room next operating theatre , allow `` real-time '' imaging perform . If positive signal detect EnLight Imaging System ( `` EnLight positive '' ) LightPath Imaging System ( `` LightPath positive '' ) surgeon perform cavity shaving positive area ( maximum thickness 10mm ) . After resection , shaving ( ) examine EnLight LightPath Imaging Systems . A member research team operate surgeon operate LightPath Imaging System . The EnLight use surgeon image surgical cavity post WLE . If surgeon detects positive signal EnLight , s/he perform cavity shaving beta positive area ( maximum thickness 10mm ) . All cavity shaving examine EnLight LightPath Imaging Systems send histopathological analysis . Sutures and/or surgical clip place WLE specimen cavity shaving ( perform ) record anatomical orientation , per standard practice . Positive signal resect WLE specimen cavity shaving ( perform ) mark surgeon prolene suture facilitate accurate correlation histopathology . If two positive signal detect , multiple prolene suture use . BCS plus SLNB Subjects schedule BCS plus SLNB receive 150 MBq 99mTc nanocolloid 5 MBq/kg 18F-FDG , maximum 300 MBq . 99mTc nanocolloid inject periareolarly Nuclear Medicine Department prior surgery . 18F-FDG administer intravenously Nuclear Medicine Department , 60-180 minute prior estimate start EnLight LightPath imaging . The gamma probe use injection 18F-FDG identify localise 99mTc SLN uptake transcutaneously . The finding 18F-FDG injection compare make sure 18F-FDG mask extraordinarily low active sentinel node . It important emphasize expect occur . Blue dye inject intra-operatively per standard procedure . BCS perform described section 'BCS ' . As per standard practice gamma probe blue dye use identify SLNs . Prior dissection SLNs , EnLight use surgeon image SLNs vivo . All excise SLNs image EnLight subsequently LightPath Imaging System time surgical procedure . Following dissection SLNs , surgeon scan axilla EnLight identify lymph node non-blue , non-palpable gamma probe negative , EnLight positive . EnLight positive lymph node excise imaged EnLight subsequently LightPath Imaging System . As per SLNB standard care maximum number lymph node excise four total . The LightPath Imaging System locate room next operating theatre , allow `` real-time '' imaging perform . The EnLight positive and/or LightPath positive SLNs clearly label order facilitate correlation histopathology . BCS plus ALND Subjects schedule BCS plus ALND receive 5 MBq/kg 18F-FDG , maximum 300 MBq . 18F-FDG administer intravenously Nuclear Medicine Department , 60-180 minute prior estimate start EnLight LightPath imaging . BCS perform described section 'BCS ' . The surgeon palpate ALND specimen prior complete resection identify palpable node . If present , palpable node image vivo EnLight . The ALND specimen excise per standard practice . The surgeon examine excise ALND tissue EnLight , EnLight positive lymph node dissect ALND specimen . The maximum number lymph node dissect ALND specimen four . All dissect lymph node image ex vivo EnLight subsequently LightPath Imaging System time surgical procedure . The dissected lymph node send separately histopathological analysis correlate imaging finding histopathology . The LightPath Imaging Systems locate room next operating theatre , allow `` real-time '' imaging perform . The EnLight and/or LightPath positive SLNs clearly label order facilitate correlation histopathology . Histopathology WLE specimen , shaving lymph node Following EnLight LightPath imaging , WLE specimen examine accord standard care histopathology analysis . Details tumour dimension along histopathology minimum dataset item record . Additional section EnLight positive and/or LightPath positive area mark prolene suture take facilitate accurate histopathology correlation . The additional section affect standard care histopathology analysis . The distance tumour six margin ( medial , lateral , superior , inferior , anterior posterior ) record . A margin classify positive either invasive carcinoma within 1mm DCIS within 2mm specimen surface per current practice institution . Histopathology analysis perform tissue shaving obtain result EnLight and/or LightPath imaging . Lymph node examine accord standard care histopathology analysis . The presence metastatic disease record classified macrometastasis ( ≥ 2 mm ) , micrometastasis ( &lt; 2 mm &gt; 0.2 mm ) isolate tumour cell ( ≤ 0.2 mm ) . EnLight LightPath imaging must perform without unnecessary delay , follow acquisition time set IFU , order avoid degradation specimen quality prior transfer tissue bank / pathology department routine analysis . Details adverse event record . An ease use questionnaire complete operator use EnLight LightPath , interpret record EnLight LightPath image . Radiation dosimetry Staff Nuclear Medicine department monitor per standard practice . Throughout surgical procedure , staff operate theatre wear instant readout monthly badge dosimeter . Staff handle surgical specimen also wear ring dosimeter . Staff care subject recovery area wear monthly badge dosimeter . Pathology staff process WLE lymph node specimen wear monthly badge ring dosimeter . Follow-up Subject participation end conclusion surgical procedure . Adverse event record discharge , 24 hour first study procedure , whichever sooner .</detailed_description>
