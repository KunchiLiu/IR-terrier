	<detailed_description>Persons heart failure ( HF ) four-fold great likelihood develop cognitive impairment ( CI ) age match healthy counterpart , place high risk adverse clinical outcome , poor quality life ( QOL ) high mortality . CI subtle measurable deficit one multiple cognitive domain ; deficit great cognitive loss associate normal age . The study document CI HF inconsistent . Few use standard neuropsychological testing , little known change cognitive function time HF . Further , CI detect , currently effective evidenced-based guideline help restore improve cognition population.Despite age population project rise CI HF , 2 small intervention study document , indicate critical need research area . The etiology CI HF fully understood , several underlie mechanism consistently report : reduced cerebral perfusion oxygenation , brain structural change ( i.e. , hippocampal damage , atrophy , loss gray matter ) , micro emboli.Clinical study show CI improved cardiac transplantation modifiable standard therapy improve cardiac output , oxygenation , fluid overload , systemic cerebral perfusion ; finding inconsistent anecdotal . The ability positively influence cognitive function important implication patient adherence complex self-care regimen development intervention may partially reverse CI . Exercise improve clinical outcome HF alter deleterious peripheral central mechanism contribute HF exacerbation , worsen symptom severity , lead poor clinical outcome . Less known effect exercise cognitive function . Animal research provide compelling evidence exercise positively affect neuronal growth neural system involve learning memory . Similar human finding emerge ; recent advance neuroimaging support participation regular exercise lead specific change brain structure function . Exercise also think enhance brain plasticity . BDNF appear play crucial role process : BDNF level increase follow exercise , cognitive function improves . The association exercise , BDNF cognitive function previously report HF . This feasibility study clarify important relationship increase potential improve clinical outcome future trial . Neurogenesis neuroplasticity mean brain recover poor perfusion oxygen deprivation occur HF . Animal study provide strong evidence date use cognitive training ( CT ) promote well cognitive function provide rationale combine exercise CT approach may superior monotherapy . Animal study show , like exercise , learn task perform cognitively stimulate activity also increase BDNF level improve learn memory . The effect BDNF brain function due exercise however , think different occur CT . Exercise increase proliferation division neuronal cell BDNF , whereas CT appear promote cell survival , suggest synergistic relationship may exist great benefit obtain use together . The combination exercise plasticity-based CT previously test HF population intervention improve cognitive outcome , may optimal target underlying mechanism CI HF . The propose feasibility study design test acceptability , implementation limit efficacy combine exercise ( Ex ) cognitive training ( CT ) intervention stable NYHA class II III heart failure patient cognitive impairment . A total 60 participant randomize one three study arm : Ex/CT ( N=20 ) , Ex-alone ( N=20 ) , attention control ( N=20 ) . The study aim : Aim 1 : To evaluate feasibility 3-arm intervention ( ExCT , Ex , AC ) heart failure patient CI . Aim 1a . To test acceptability implementation study arm . Aim 2 : To ascertain limited efficacy 3-arm intervention change cognitive ability Aim 3 : To ascertain limited efficacy 3-arm intervention improve cerebral oxygenation , physiological status , physical function QOL .</detailed_description>
