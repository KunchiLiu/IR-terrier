	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see whether PT-20 help people high level phosphate blood ( call Hyperphosphatemia ) treat dialysis kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety PT20 Subjects With Hyperphosphataemia Dialysis Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated serum phosphate ubiquitous complication reduce kidney function evidence suggest metabolic disturbance associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality subject receive haemodialysis Efforts achieve normal serum phosphate dietary restriction , thrice weekly dialysis phosphate binder fail substantially improve achieve serum phosphate level . Data large international practice pattern study suggest approximately 50 % dialysis subject serum phosphate recommend target value 5.5 mg/dL The standard care phosphate control remain prescription phosphate binder meal . These drug act small intestine bind phosphate prevent absorption bloodstream . The 2 general category phosphate binder currently commercially available include calcium contain phosphate binder ( calcium carbonate calcium acetate ) non calcium contain phosphate binder ( sevelamer carbonate lanthanum carbonate While 2 class phosphate binder similar efficacy , differ substantially associate side effect .</detailed_description>
