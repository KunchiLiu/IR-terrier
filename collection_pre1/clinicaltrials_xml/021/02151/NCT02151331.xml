	<brief_title>Improving Mental Health Outcomes : Building Adaptive Implementation Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite availability psychosocial evidence-based practice ( EBPs ) , quality outcome person mental disorder remain suboptimal organizational barrier implementation . Replicating Effective Programs ( REP ) , site-level implementation strategy apply promote use psychosocial treatment community-based practice , still result less half site actually sustain use treatment . Based input community partner previous research , study team subsequently enhance REP include Facilitation , novel implementation strategy address site-level organizational barrier EBP adoption beyond REP 's emphasis fidelity . Two Facilitation role develop : External Internal Facilitators . External Facilitators ( EFs ) reside outside clinic , support study , provide technical expertise provider adapt use EBPs routine practice . Internal Facilitators ( IFs ) employ site , direct reporting relationship site leadership , local knowledge help provider implement EBPs . IFs also address site-specific organizational barrier may observable baseline EFs . The overarch goal study build cost-effective adaptive implementation intervention involve REP augmentation EF IF role improve patient outcome uptake EBP mood disorder ( Life Goals-LG ) community setting . The primary aim cluster randomized trial determine , among site initially respond REP ( i.e. , limited LG uptake ) , effect adaptive implementation intervention sit receive External Internal Facilitator ( REP+EF/IF ) versus External Facilitator alone ( REP+EF ) improve patient-level outcome , include mental health quality life decrease symptom , well increase LG use among patient mood disorder 12 month . Secondary aim determine , among site continue exhibit non-response 12 month , effect continue Facilitation patient-level outcome 24 month , describe implementation EF IF , conduct cost-effectiveness analysis REP+EF/IF compare REP+EF 24-month period . A representative cohort 80 community-based outpatient clinic ( total 1,600 patient ) different U.S. region ( Michigan , Colorado , Arkansas ) include study . We use Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial ( SMART ) design build best adaptive implementation intervention . This groundbreaking study design address three crucial implementation issue : First , IFs costly site since require additional administrative effort . Second , extent off-site EF alone versus addition on-site IF improve patient outcome community setting unclear . Finally , among site continue exhibit non-response 12 month Facilitation , value continue implementation strategy ( i.e. , delayed effect ) assess , especially small practice rural setting .</detailed_description>
