	<brief_summary>Following exploratory project , fund Guys St Thomas ' Charity September 2010- November 2011 , first combine mental health screen intervention project &lt; 5 Children Care ( CiC ) UK , current study expand work ) develop feasibility study assess long term intervention outcomes group b ) extend model two vulnerable group young child . The three group child age 3 month 3 year ( &lt; 4 's ) Southwark include : 1 . Children become newly look ( CiC ) 2 . Children parent refer Parental Mental Health team ( PMH ) 3 . Children Child Protection ( CP ) Plans Parents invite take part study child eligible within group . Informed consent obtain outset . Hypothesis ; The investigator aim implement method screen identify socioemotional mental health need infant young child , age 0-3 year age , across three high risk cohort ( Children Care , child Child Protection Plan , child parent mental health difficulty ) . Is feasible deliver early treatment intervention positively impact difficulty identify , provide specific emotional , social mental health support advice child 's current caregiver relation child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose feasibility study evaluate impact specific mental health intervention child , parent carers three high risk group child age 4 year . Recruitment This research take place Carelink , CAMHS Looked Children 's team . A brief introduction research send relevant appointment information parent group state may approach researcher particular time ( e.g schedule Contact , CP conference , appointment keyworker ) . The letter say researcher making contact discus detail research agree convenient date parent . It make clear participation voluntary . We make letter brief clear possible parent may difficulty process information like stressful time . If birth parent agree meet CAMHS research practitioner , give opportunity ask question discuss study detail facilitate inform consent . Also meet set time first screen visit take place parent confirm participation . We inform keyworkers family give informed consent participate study . For group , screen take place two home visit ( unless parent carers particularly wish meet alternative location ) last approximately one hour . The screen visit take place child 's current home setting . Procedure : In Group 1 birth parent invite complete Ages Stages Questionnaire : Social Emotional ( ASQ : SE ) gain view child 's need . The home visit screen include ASQ-SE interview child 's foster kinship carer ( Group 1 ) parent ( Groups 2 3 ) follow Keys Interactive Parenting Scale ( KIPS ) free play observation child carer/parent . The KIPS observation videoed , gain specific consent , cod live observation parent carer wish videoed . We also administer Mind-mindedness measure ( MM ) language scale . The DASS also complete birth parent Groups 2 3 . Additional information may gain regard child 's health development Child Health service , gather either child statutory initial health assessment ( IHA ) Group 1 , child refer health developmental check Groups 2 3 . Interventions : The detailed information screen process use inform specific strength need relation individual child parent caregiver guide intervention plan agree parent caregiver accord cohort ( Groups 1-3 ) . The intervention primarily aim promote healthy child development , responsive parenting behaviour positive cycle carer-child relation . Six month review screening take place family ; child carers join study complete screen first 9 month period two review screening join time one review . The review screening follow structure initial screening measure complete order outcome child child-carer relationship obtain . In addition , information child 's use health social care service collect family , use CA-SUS , 6 12-month follow-up point , allow assessment cost screen intervention exploration factor influence economic burden . Evaluation : We hypothesize screen may pick undetected misunderstood social-emotional , developmental attachment difficulty , small number case specific mental health disorder child . We also expect gain great understand area difficulty key aspects child 's relationship primary caregiver . By intervene early specifically address issue identify screen hope intervention impact positively quality carer-child relationship well child 's social-emotional development . In addition , anticipate close interagency collaboration develop study positively impact care plan decision-making around child take place timely fashion . Data already collect parent child retain identifiable form use research . This important give research team information high risk group vulnerable parent . This make clear consent procedure . Study participant assign alphanumerical study identification number time provide consent . The ID number use study electronic database , questionnaire report form . The study identification number record consent form ( participant 's full name ) . Participant contact detail need duration study keep together paper study record lock cabinet lock office secure NHS building . Copies write report , correspondence process recording screen intervention store password protect ' u ' drive Trust computer . A Research Consultant Health Economics Consultant coordinate analysis data research staff employ study . All information store secure data base . Differences level uptake screening , proportion family carers engage treatment offer prevalence type difficulty three group examine use Chi Square test association . Comparison score KIPS , ASQ : SE Mind mindedness measure make high risk group intervention use t-tests univariate multivariate analysis variance . Comparisons score make type intervention offer use t-tests . Other outcome , comparison view contact worker new system implement decision timescales project make use Chisquare test association t-tests . Qualitative feedback birth parent , foster carers , kinship carers professional usefulness screen process intervention analyse use information collect feedback questionnaire design study . The economic evaluation involve : 1 ) Calculation cost intervention provide part propose work ; 2 ) Description calculation total cost health social care service use ; 3 ) Exploration characteristic participant family influence economic burden . Data use hospital community health social care service collect use Child Adolescent Service Use Schedule ( CASUS ) , administer interview parents/carers 6 12month followup . Information use intervention three group collect directly therapist record . The intervention evaluation cost use standard microcosting approach ( Drummond et al , 2005 ) basis salary therapist plus appropriate overhead expense ( administrative , managerial capital ) . Calculation indirect time , include preparation supervision , base information provide therapist ratio direct face face contact activity Nationally applicable unit cost apply service use ( Curtis , 2012 ) . Service use cost three population report descriptively ( mean , standard deviation , median range ) explore cost burden . Prior statistical analysis generate hypotheses factor likely influence service use cost draw evidence review literature expert opinion research team . Only limited number hypothesis driven predictor select available baseline characteristic study participant order avoid find association chance . In line previous research ( Byford et al , 2001 ; Barrett et al , 2012 ) , univariate association specify factor total health social care cost examine use linear regression . Multiple regression use reduce variable set factor independently associate cost . This initially include variable find significant univariate association discard cease important . Each variable univariate association cost add , one time , retain add significantly model otherwise discard . This ensure none excluded factor would add significantly model . We use significance level pâ‰¤0.05 ( 5 % ) . Standard ordinary least square regression use untransformed cost , despite skew distribution cost data , enables inference make arithmetic mean ( Barber &amp; Thompson , 1998 ) . The result model checked comparison nonparametric bootstrap regression , assess robustness confidence interval p value non-normality cost distribution , generalise linear model , non-normal gamma distribution assume cost ( Blough et al , 1999 ) .</detailed_description>
