	<brief_summary>- Gefitinib orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) . However , 20-30 % patient EGFR-activating mutation show intrinsic resistance EGFR-TKI . - EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell BIM ( BCL2L11 ) deletion polymorphism show impaired generation BIM proapoptotic BH3 domain , well resistance EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis . - Both BIM polymorphism ( 12.9 % ) EGFR mutation ( 50 % lung adenocarcinoma ) prevalent East Asian Caucasian population . BIM BH3-only proapoptotic member Bcl-2 protein family . BIM upregulation require apoptosis induction EGFR-TKI EGFR-mutant NSCLC . - Vorinostat ( suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [ SAHA ] ) small-molecule inhibitor histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) induce cell differentiation , cell cycle arrest , apoptosis several tumor cell . HDAC inhibition epigenetically restore BIM function death sensitivity EGFR-TKI patient EGFR-mutant NSCLC resistance EGFR-TKI associate common BIM polymorphism . EGFR-TKI resistance due BIM polymorphism may able circumvent combination HDAC inhibition vorinostat gefitinib NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- A cohort three patient treat dose level one cycle ( 28 day per cycle ) . - Treatment continue DLTs record , three patient treat next high dose level . - If patient cohort develop DLT , however , another cohort three patient treat 1 cycle . - If DLTs develop , dose escalation continue . - If one three patient develop DLT dose level , another cohort three patient treat next low dose level . - If DLTs record cohort , number patient per cohort increase 3 6 . - Up 12 patient enrol MTD . - Therefore , phase II dose combine therapy define high dose level six patient treat less three DLTs develop .</detailed_description>
