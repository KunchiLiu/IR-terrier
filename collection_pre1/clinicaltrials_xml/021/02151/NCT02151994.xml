	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , double blind , randomise , placebo-controlled combine single ascend dose ( SAD ) , include food interaction ( food effect , FE ) analysis , multiple ascend dose ( MAD ) study . SAD : This part consist eligibility screening period , one study period involve administration single dos BIA 5-1058 placebo accord randomized design , follow-up period . Nine sequential group 8 healthy young male subject dose . Within group , 6 subject randomise receive BIA 5-1058 2 subject randomise receive placebo . In first-in-human study , subject participate low dose level 5 mg dose accord sentinel dosing design ensure optimal safety . Initially , 2 subject dose ; 1 subject BIA 5-1058 1 subject placebo . After safety tolerability result first 24 h follow dose initial subject find acceptable MI , 6 subject lowest dose level dose . MAD : This part consist eligibility screening period , one study period involve administration multiple dose BIA 5-1058 placebo daily 10 day , follow-up period . Five sequential group 8 healthy young male subject dose . Within group , 6 subject randomise receive BIA 5-1058 2 subject randomise receive placebo . The start dose 50 mg choose take consideration dose range previous SAD sequential group approve IEC . Escalation next high dose determination next dose level base safety , tolerability available PK result previously administer dose FE : This part consist eligibility screening period , open-label two-way crossover study period , follow-up period . One group 12 subject receive single dos 400 mg BIA 5-1058 2 treatment period , fast overnight consumption high fat breakfast . Each treatment separated period least 7 day . The treatment sequence determine randomisation .</detailed_description>
