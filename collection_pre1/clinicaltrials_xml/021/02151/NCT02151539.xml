	<brief_summary>This research trial study medical chart review determine outcome second-line therapy patient acute graft-versus-host disease previously treat extracorporeal photopheresis systemic therapy . Gathering information second-line therapy patient acute graft-versus-host disease may help doctor learn disease find good treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Outcomes Second-Line Therapy Acute Graft-Versus-Host Study Including ECP ( POSTAGE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 6-month freedom treatment failure second-line therapy acute graft versus host disease ( aGVHD ) . II . To show extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) associate superior 6 month ( ) freedom treatment failure ( FFTF ) compare treatment modality second line therapy aGVHD . III . To describe health care burden patient receive second line therapy acute GVHD . IV . Quality life measurement use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant ( FACT-BMT ) patient receive second line therapy aGVHD . OUTLINE : Study data collect manage use Research Electronic Data Capture ( REDCap ) tool baseline day 5 , 28 , 56 . After completion study , patient follow 6 month , 1 2 year .</detailed_description>
