	<brief_summary>Around 7500 neonate bear yearly United States complex congenital heart disease require surgical repair first day life . The complexity surgical repair require long period cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) use intermittent period low flow complete circulatory arrest . The immature neonatal vital organ prone complication cardiopulmonary bypass circulation , namely ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury systemic inflammatory response . Inhaled nitric oxide ( NO ) use frequently neonates treatment pulmonary hypertension , Additionally , many study show NO anti-inflammatory effect reduce I/R injury endothelial dysfunction . The purpose pilot study ass efficacy NO administration via CPB circuit attenuate CPB induce I/R injury systemic inflammatory reaction neonate undergo repair complex congenital heart defect . Specific goal demonstrate NO use via CPB : - Decrease marker I/R injury systemic inflammatory response . - Decrease platelet activation lead reduce postoperative bleeding transfusion requirement . - Decrease postoperative organ dysfunction , hence decrease operative mortality postoperative morbidity . Twelve neonate undergo repair complex congenital heart defect receive NO via CPB circuit , duration surgery . They compare control group 12 similar patient . Serum level different ischemic reperfusion injury inflammatory marker measure different time point surgery correlate different end organ function test clinical course postoperative period . The result compare two group try determine clinical benefit NO administration CPB circuit .</brief_summary>
