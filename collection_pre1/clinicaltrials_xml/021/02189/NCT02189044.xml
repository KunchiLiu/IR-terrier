	<brief_summary>Introduction : Among system organism , believe respiratory system one get old faster due great exposure environmental pollutant years.The Pilates method emerge form fitness particularly provide general welfare individual . Objective : To evaluate effect Pilates ' exercise respiratory muscle strength elderly woman . Methods : The investigator study 07 woman age 60 , preserve autonomy cognitive skill . The Pulmonary Function Test ( Spirometry ) perform use Vitalograph® spirometer , model 8600 . Respiratory muscle strength obtain technical measurement maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , analog Gerar manometer . The experiment last eleven ( 11 ) week . For comparative analysis data obtain evaluation , investigator apply paired test significance level 5 % .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODOLOGY This study clinical , longitudinal , prospective trial conduct Laboratory Kinesiology Cinesioterapia Physiotherapy , Federal University Triangulo Mineiro - UFTM . All participant sign informed consent . The research start approval Ethics Committee UFTM Research Protocol ( 2147-2012 ) . Subject Initially invitation make student enrolled Open University Third Age - UATI / UFTM August October 2012 . The selection base follow inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) age 60 year , ( 2 ) non-practicing regular physical activity , ( 3 ) availability attend Pilates class twice week ( addition time UATI ) ( 4 ) preserve cognitive autonomy exclusion criterion : history ( 1 ) diseases directly affect posture ( disc herniation angular deformity spine ) , ( 2 ) cardiovascular , respiratory neurological disease prevent attainment Pilates exercise , ( 3 ) impair cognitive capacity limit autonomy self-determination , ( 4 ) withdrawal participation assessment process , ( 5 ) two consecutive absence total three absence propose time training set . Thus , propose methodology study apply seven woman mean age 64 ± 6 year . Review / Procedures The assessment instrument use : ( 1 ) Initial Assessment Sheet , ( 2 ) spirometer ( 3 ) manometer . The record initial assessment spirometry apply selection participant . Through initial evaluation form possible assess aspect health status participant ( associate disease , blood pressure , respiratory heart rate , postural assessment ) well information personal history , family history current medication . A pulmonary function test ( spirometry ) perform use Vitalograph ® spirometer brand model 8600 . Equipment calibrate , test perform single train qualified examiner instruction standardized voice command , I standard advocate Consensus Brazilian Espirometria.12 Spirometry perform rule lung disease affect performance propose exercise . To assess respiratory muscle strength , volunteer remain stand position use nose clip . Respiratory muscle strength obtain technique measurement maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP ) , mean analog manometer Generate brand , scale ± 300 cmH2O , equip nozzle adapter , contain hole 2 mm diameter , serve relief muscle bocais.4 MIP valve obtain maximal inspiration precede maximal expiration residual volume level MEP maximal expiration precede maximal inspiration , total lung capacity . Were perform least three maneuver maximal inspiratory pressure maximal expiratory pressure , order obtain great value three acceptable . The measurement respiratory muscle strength occur analog manometer ( Ger-Air ® , São Paulo , Brazil ) , scale - 300 +300 cmH2O ( calibrate ) , equip plastic trachea 16 cm long 2.4 cm internal diameter , hard plastic mouthpiece drain hole approximately 2 mm diameter dissipate pressure generate muscle face orofaringe.13 maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) expiratory pressure obtain maximum ( MEP ) , carry maximum five time , acceptable reproducible , stand position , use nose clip , time sustain three second . The value MIP obtain residual volume , MEP total lung capacity . Volunteers due verbal encouragement 10 % measure another , new difference maneuver perform , consider high value since último.14 Therapeutic Intervention - Pilates Method The training Pilates exercise perform eleven week . The participant instruct miss attend class twice week . Each class consist five exercise last 40 minute lesson . During first four week ( 1 st 4 th week ) exercise perform : Cat , Coffee Table , Single legcircle , pelvic movement , contraction glute closure perform posterior chain elongation range . In next four week ( 5th 8th week ) begin new series exercise , : Bridge , Side Table , Bridge hip roll legextension , Abdominal - halfhollup , oblique , ultimately Stretching - Series William 's . In last four week training ( 9th 11th week ) propose new series exercise involve : Beaststroke , Support heel Bridge - hip roll leg extension , Hundred Squats bat wall . All exercise perform expiration . Statistical Analysis Descriptive data analysis perform , mean standard deviation . For comparative analysis data obtain pre-and post-intervention , paired test apply ( confirm normal distribution sample - Shapiro Wilk test ) . The level significance set 5 % . The statistical program use 18.0 SSPSS .</detailed_description>
