	<brief_title>Prostate Cancer Upgrading Reference Set</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint study presence tumor upgrading time radical prostatectomy . Upgrading define : Gleason 3+4 high grade A secondary study endpoint presence prostate cancer beyond prostate ( pathologic T3 disease ) radical prostatectomy . ( This finding may consider rationale treatment . ) Evidence pathologic stage T3 high disease assess presence : ( 1 ) seminal vesicle invasion ( 2 ) positive surgical margin ( 3 ) establish extracapsular extension ( 4 ) lymph node involvement tumor . It note pathologic stage T3 disease , generally portend great risk disease recurrence , may intrinsic feature disease prognosis artifact surgical technique . Nonetheless , secondary risk assessment tool include Gleason 7-10 endpoint plus patient pT3+ disease composite endpoint could indicate disease best manage treatment lieu active surveillance.Prostate cancer , confirm prostate biopsy , within two year schedule radical prostatectomy . 2 . Prostate cancer must grade Gleason 3+3 biopsy immediately prior radical prostatectomy . ( Secondary eligibility establish central review pathology slide , block available , Cornell Central Pathology Laboratory confirm eligibility . ) 3 . Prostate cancer may detect prior biopsy well must great Gleason 3+3 . ( Also require Central Pathology Laboratory review . ) 4 . Slides must available Central Pathology Laboratory review biopsy show prostate cancer . FFPE ( formalin fix paraffin embed ) block may also request available . 5 . Patient must select radical prostatectomy treatment prostate cancer . 6 . Signed informed consent . 7 . Blocks and/or slide prostate biopsy radical prostatectomy must available analysis Central Pathology laboratory . 8 . Willingness provide long-term follow-up information regard additional treatment cancer status . 9 . Willingness provide blood urine specimen prior radical prostatectomy placement Early Detection Research Network ( EDRN ) Upgrading Reference Set repository . 10 . Willingness provide demographic clinical information relate prostate cancer prostate cancer risk ( e.g. , race/ethnicity , family history prostate cancer ) .</detailed_description>
