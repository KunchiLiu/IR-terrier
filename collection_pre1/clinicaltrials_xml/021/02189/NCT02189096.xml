	<brief_title>Validation Early Warning Score &amp; Lactate Prehospital Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Question Objective : Are NEWS score , Sepsis Screening Lactate measurement predictor outcome unselected hospital patient ? Specific Aims : To determine whether follow , alone combination , predictor outcome , namely in-hospital mortality within 24 hour 30 day ICU admission within two day : - single prehospital NEWS perform arrival Scottish Ambulance Service ( SAS ) - Prehospital Sepsis screening ( SIRS criterion evidence infection ) arrival SAS - Prehospital Point Care Lactate perform NEWS great equal 4 Sepsis present Background Information : NHS Scotland commit improve outcome patient Sepsis Deteriorating Patient evidence inclusion Scottish Patient Safety Programme . An important element improve care Sepsis deteriorate patient early identification early intervention , show improve outcome . Physiological deterioration often precede clinical deterioration patient develop critical illness . Recognition lead development Early Warning Scoring ( EWS ) system , allow early identification physiological deterioration . By assign numerical value various physiological parameter , composite score assign patient , allow early identification patient risk critical illness . EWS initially establish assist management patient general ward set . A recent study show increased EWS arrival Emergency Department ( ED ) associate high odds adverse outcome amongst patient sepsis . Consequently , use EWS could facilitate patient pathway ensure triage high acuity area ED senior clinician involvement early stage . The use standard single National EWS ( NEWS ) across National Health Service ( NHS ) United Kingdom recommend improve patient care . NEWS also lend extension prehospital care ambulance service . Most ambulance service routinely collect physiological data require calculate NEWS score indeed ambulance service incorporate electronic patient report form ( ePRF ) . The Scottish Ambulance Service ( SAS ) place . An agreed NEWS score great specific level could use trigger ambulance service pre-alert receiving ED . However controversy exist whether NEWS valid prehospital environment . Point care lactate testing also show feasible ED . Measurement hospital serum lactate recognise independent predictor mortality sepsis trauma may potential combine NEWS system point care improve diagnostic accuracy patient risk adverse outcome . Prehospital Point care lactate testing also show promise predictor outcome trauma patient . Previous study focus use early warning score point care lactate specific patient group . Identification condition sepsis challenging , particularly prehospital environment . In study , aim apply use early warning score point care test cohort ambulance patient assess feasibility utility approach . Study Design : Setting Five area within NHS Scotland identify area two paramedic crew take part study . The five area include NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde ( Royal Alexandra Hospital ) , NHS Dumfries &amp; Galloway ( Dumfries &amp; Galloway Royal Infirmary ) , NHS Fife ( Victoria Hospital ) , NHS Lothian ( Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ) NHS Western Isles ( Western Isles Hospital ) . These area choose represent spectrum clinical setting NHS Scotland dense urban area remote rural area . Posters place ambulance five clinical area inform patient anonymised data collect study . Methods The study run 12-month period . The design prospective , non-randomised , 3 stag interventional study . Phase 1 ( 4 month ) No change current practice . Each Paramedic crew routinely document patient observation electronic Patient Report Form ( ePRF ) every patient encounter . These physiological parameter electronically capture . The data use calculate NEWS screen Sepsis ( 2 modify SIRS criterion [ sign systemic inflammation ] suspicion infection ) study investigator . An estimate make time completion ePRF relation patient transport . The National Early Warning Score ( NEWS ) contain seven physiological parameter , assign value 0 3 ( 0 2 supplemental oxygen ) . The score parameter sum calculate NEWS may range 0 20 ; high score great deviation normality . The NEWS base previous similar score system . Sepsis define presence SIRS criterion suspicion infection . Phase 2 ( 4 month ) The ten crew undertake implementation NEWS Sepsis Screening . Prior stage study , crew attend half day educational session cover rationale use NEWS . Each Paramedic crew continue routinely document patient observation electronic Patient Report Form ( ePRF ) every patient encounter . These physiological parameter use calculate NEWS screen Sepsis ( 2 modify SIRS criterion suspicion infection ) . The NEWS available paramedic crew . If NEWS great equal 4 patient screen positive Sepsis , patient transfer per normal protocol receive ED staff receive information NEWS score Sepsis screen part structure handover . Phase 3 ( 4 month ) The ten crew undertake Point Care Lactate measurement NEWS ≥ 4 patient screen positive Sepsis . Each Paramedic crew continue routinely document patient observation electronic Patient Report Form ( ePRF ) every patient encounter . These physiological parameter use calculate NEWS screen Sepsis ( 2 modify SIRS criterion suspicion infection ) . If NEWS great equal 4 patient screen positive Sepsis , Lactate measure CG4+ i-STAT cartridge . The lactate level , along NEWS score sepsis screening , give receive ED staff part structure handover . Each crew undergo half day educational session cover use point care lactate meter . Within NHS Scotland hospital , health care practitioner currently screen sepsis NEWS ≥ 4 , measure lactate positive screen sepsis . Lactate point care measurement currently pilot prehospital set Forth Valley Health Board The i-STAT handheld analyser use study CE mark , undergone performance verification GEM Premier 400 ROCHE OMNI S blood gas analyser . It currently use clinically within NHSGG &amp; C health board , several Scottish health board Emergency Medical Retrieval Service ( EMRS ) . For 12-month duration study paramedic crew continue work within Scottish Ambulance Service protocols principle UK Ambulance Clinical Practice Guidelines , include change make SAS protocols time . Any change note study investigator . Data Collection A researcher obtain data patient study ePRF record via SAS Data Warehouse . This data store spreadsheet file accordance NHS data protection guidance . The researcher match data Wardwatcher system receive Intensive Care Units regard ICU admission ICU mortality . Data seek &lt; hospital information system &gt; receive site regard 30 day mortality . Linked data anonymised give unique identifier . The anonymised data analyse independent statistician , describe analysis plan . Inclusion Criteria : All patient attend 10 paramedic team 12-month period . Exclusion Criteria : Patients cardiac arrest Children le 16 year age Patients incomplete data collection Primary Endpoint : Primary endpoint Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission within 48 hour attendance 24 hour mortality ( all-cause ) 30-day mortality ( cause , hospital ) . Secondary Endpoints : Time 999 call ED arrival Time Scottish Ambulance Service arrival ED arrival ( first acute hospital assessment area ) On-scene time Scottish Ambulance Service Cost analysis</detailed_description>
