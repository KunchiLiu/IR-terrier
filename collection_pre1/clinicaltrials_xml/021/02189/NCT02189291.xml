	<detailed_description>Objectives The objective study help identify best practice regard use indwell catheter minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery . Investigators propose randomize controlled trial compare immediate removal indwell urethral catheter , minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy , present standard catheter removal post operative day one . Evidence base catheter management helpful provider patient post-operative decision making . Specific Aims Placement indwell catheter minimally invasive pelvic organ prolapse ( POP ) surgery routine practice . There limited evidence support use overnight indwell catheter , despite , use catheter urogynecologic surgery remain common practice . The objective study help identify best practice regard use indwell catheter minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery . Dunn et al find immediate removal catheter completion uncomplicated abdominal vaginal hysterectomy associate re-catheterization , urinary tract infection fever . They also find patient catheter remove immediately less pain compare patient indwell catheter 24 hour . The applicability study Urogynecology limit fact patient incontinence / prolapse include . Use catheter surgery may convenient provider , benefit patient uncertain . Investigators believe evidence regard optimal use catheter use urogynecologic surgery helpful provider . Risk urinary tract infection increase longer indwell catheter stay patient . Urinary tract infection associate catheter ( CAUTI ) responsible 40 % hospital acquire infection . CAUTI associate 387 , 550 hospital acquire infection year , could prevent . Investigators believe avoid placement catheter minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery result short hospital stay reduction CAUTI , thereby improve quality cost health care . Aim 1 : To demonstrate immediate removal catheter minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy result shorter hospital stay removal postoperative day 1 . Aim 2 : To demonstrate immediate removal catheter minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy confers increase risk re-catheterization . Aim 3 : To demonstrate immediate removal catheter minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy decrease occurrence urinary tract infection . Background Most patient stay hospital 23-hour observation follow minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery . The usual practice leave indwell urethral catheter overnight procedure . The use indwell catheter surgery carry multiple reason , include measure urinary output prevention urinary retention surgery . The use indwell Foley catheter surgery associate prolonged hospital stay , fever urinary tract infection . A study Haakvort et al compare removal indwell catheter post operative day 1 long catheterization vaginal find tenfold reduction urinary tract infection . The removal indwell catheter may affect length stay hospital , associate budgetary economic implication . One study find removal indwelling catheter midnight result patient discharge 0.7 day earlier patient catheter remove morning . This result short length hospital stay improve discharge planning . There wide variation practice policy regard catheter removal . With clear evidence-based practice regard catheter removal , lack data literature regard catheter removal urogynecologic surgery , practice vary among physician institution . Audits British hospital find almost half catheter remove either discretion nurse time round morning . Another study find catheter schedule remove morning , 70 % removed time . Dunn et al look removal indwelling catheter immediately hysterectomy compare removal 24 hour . They find immediate removal catheter surgery associate adverse outcome need re-catheterization , patient immediate removal report significantly less pain compare counterpart catheter removal 24 hour . Similarly , Alessandri find woman catheter remove early shorter mean ambulation time hospital stay shorter 19 hour . This show economic benefit early discharge associate early catheter removal , however study lack urogynecology literature . In addition potential benefit health care cost , immediate catheter removal several health benefit . There evidence early ambulation reduces incidence clinically evident deep venous thrombosis . Therefore , early removal indwell urethral catheter surgery may contribute towards reduce postoperative morbidity reduce incidence post operative deep venous thrombosis decrease health care cost aid towards early discharge . Another advantage immediate catheter removal surgery low incidence urinary tract infection . There study offer insight postoperative voiding efficiency uncomplicated minimally invasive urogynecologic surgery . There variation practice regard length time indwell catheter leave place . Multiple factor contribute long catheter stay . In absence strong evidence , decision depend physician preference , staff convenience patient tolerance . The use indwell urethral catheter usual practice gynecologic POP surgery . Despite routine practice , seem little evidence support use indwell urethral catheter gynecologic surgery . Generally , indwell urethral catheter use surgery monitoring output , patient mobile . This may usual case urogynecologic surgery . Some reason routine use catheter urogynecologic surgery include allow bladder empty voiding may difficult due effect surgery , pain swell surround soft tissue . The routine use indwell catheter routine urogynecologic surgery carry risk morbidity include detrusor overactivity , urinary tract infection pain urethra . There lack agreement among provider regard optimal time removal urethral catheter surgery . Usual practice base provider preference already establish institution practice rather evidence base practice . Although different institution provider different practice policy , evidence base practice regard effect time catheter remove length time catheter leave place prior removal surgery . Most place leave catheter overnight surgery . One possible reason may reduce staff night may respond complication urinary retention , follow catheter removal . Another perceive reason leave catheter overnight patient rest night get back normal void next day , catheter remove morning . Cochrane review Griffiths Fernandez suggest need randomize trial address question regard catheter removal among discrete subgroup specialty . The usual practice indwell foley catheter urogynecologic surgery may convenience provider , limited evidence literature regard benefit patient gain practice . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure hospital stay hour completion surgery need re-catheterization . Hospital stay count time patient leave operate room time leave hospital . To avoid confounding , investigator include first / morning case day . For re-catheterization , investigator evaluate patient able void completion surgery . Investigators compare post voiding residual , need re-catheterizations number patient go home indwell catheter two group . Investigators also compare number urinary tract infection , document urine culture subsequent treatment , two group . Data Collection Investigators obtain demographic information . On post operative day 1 , investigator obtain patient satisfaction pain score . Pain score obtain use pictorial `` Wong Scale , '' assess level pain location ( i.e. , bladder urethra vs. surgical site ) . Furthermore , patient ask whether use treatment ( yes ) . All patient expect discharge follow day counsel . Patients assign immediate removal undergo follow protocol : The indwelling catheter remove prior exit operate room . If patient urge void immediately post operatively , void record post void residual determine bladder scan . If post void residual 1/3 total volume , patient consider passed void trial intervention . In patient 1/3 post void residual inability void four hour completion surgery , bladder volume check bladder scan . In subject le 300 mL urine , give additional two hour void . For patient &gt; 300 mL urine , undergo straight catheterization re-enter void trial cycle . For patient void six hour , straight catheterization perform re-enter void trial cycle give four hour void . This process continue three total cycle ( 1st cycle post operative , two cycle thereafter ) , time give indwell catheter . For patient assign catheter removal post operative day one , investigator perform backfill void trial prior catheter removal . Investigators plan perform backfill void trial show inferior wait void avoid confound regard discharge time hospital . Bladder fill 300 mL sterile water indwell catheter remove . Patient ask void hat thereafter , able void least 200 mL , would complete successful void trial . If unable void , investigator perform straight catheterization allow four hour void . Patients unable pas void trial two attempt go home either indwell catheter perform self catheterization ( depend patient 's comfort ) . For purpose study , patient go home catheter self catheterization group go home catheter . Investigators compare incidence urinary tract infection within four week surgery , document urine culture / treatment .</detailed_description>
