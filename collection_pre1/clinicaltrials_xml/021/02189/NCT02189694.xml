	<brief_summary>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The main objective project compare efficacy single-hormone closed-loop strategy , dual-hormone closed-loop strategy pump therapy regulate overnight glucose level child type 1 diabetes diabetes camp . The investigator hypothesize dual-hormone closed-loop strategy reduces time spend hypoglycemia child type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) compare single-hormone closed-loop strategy , turn effective conventional pump therapy reduce time spend hypoglycemia</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Closed-loop strategy compose three component : glucose sensor read glucose level , insulin pump infuse insulin dose mathematical algorithm decide required insulin dosage base sensor 's reading . A dual-hormone closed-loop system would regulate glucose level infusion two hormone : insulin glucagon . The investigator aim conduct randomize three-way cross-over trial compare single hormone closed-loop strategy , dual-hormone closed-loop strategy conventional pump therapy . The investigator aim compare three intervention 3 consecutive night child type 1 diabetes diabetes camp .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males females 8 17 year old . Clinical diagnosis type 1 diabetes least one year . The subject insulin pump therapy least 3 month . HbA1c â‰¤ 11.0 % . Clinically significant nephropathy , neuropathy retinopathy judge investigator . Severe hypoglycemic episode within two week inclusion study . A severe hypoglycemic episode define loss conscience , seizure hospital emergency visit . Current use oral glucocorticoid medication ( except low stable dose accord investigator judgement ) . Stable dos inhaled steroid acceptable . Known suspect allergy trial product . Other serious medical illness likely interfere study participation ability complete trial judgment investigator . Failure comply team 's recommendation ( e.g . willing use trial pump , etc ) .</criteria>
