	<brief_title>Treatment Pediatric Anxiety Disorders Predicting Treatment Response Through Biocellular Markers Sleep</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current evidence base psychiatric treatment child , adolescent , young adult anxiety disorder involve trial error process . Pediatric psychiatrist start first line treatment ( i.e . SSRI psychotherapy ) , require 4-8 week work . There long interval treatment initiation response 50 60 % likelihood treatment choose succeed reduce anxiety symptom . The science enable u predict respond medication treatment exist . Studies demonstrate correlation cellular marker white blood cell psychiatric disorder suggest certain gene may also change expression peripheral cell response treatment psychiatric disorder . Several study report significant decrease expression key gene involve pathophysiology anxiety depression brain , BDNF , CREB HDAC5 level leukocytes people mood anxiety disorder . The level BDNF , HDAC5 CREB white blood cell respond treatment match control treatment SSRIs . The increased accessibility sequence technology allow u survey many potential biomarkers possible several year ago . This may enable u formulate test predict , base biocellular marker , treatment outcome anxiety disorder child , adolescent , young adult onset treatment . By find molecular marker predict treatment success onset , investigator improve treatment outcome considerably compare current standard treatment practice . This kind personalize medicine future psychiatry .</detailed_description>
