	<brief_summary>The overall goal investigator-initiated trial evaluate treatment outcome depression utilize platform algorithm product allow rapid identification pharmacokinetic ( PK ) and/or pharmacodynamic ( PD ) genomic variation . This new technology may potential optimize treatment selection improve response , minimize unfavorable adverse event / side effect increase treatment adherence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Genetic Variation Treatment Algorithm Versus Treatment As Usual Management Of Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment seek depressed patient ( SCID confirm major depressive disorder bipolar I/II disorder ) Mayo Clinic Depression Center invite participate study evaluate Assurex GeneSight® platform ; new technology rapidly assess PK PD genetic variation potentially impact antidepressant , antipsychotic , stimulant associate treatment outcomes depression . This study recruit treatment seek patient major depression index episode moderate symptom severity unresponsive poorly tolerate least one prior antidepressant treatment . This 8-week , double-blind trial depress patient randomized test result GeneSight® ( tricolored clinical report ) prior treatment selection ( n=138 ) vs. treatment usual ( tricolored dummy report ) ( n=138 ) . All test result make available 8-week trial .</detailed_description>
