	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate usefulness newly develop multibending ultra-slim upper endoscope successful direct peroral cholangioscopy ( POC ) without assist accessory comparison conventional ultra-slim endoscope . The investigator expect multibending endoscope show higher successful performance conventional endoscope .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multibending vs Conventional Endoscope Direct Peroral Cholangioscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Direct POC use ultra-slim upper endoscope permit various diagnostic and/or therapeutic intraductal intervention direct endoscopic visualization select patient dilated distal CBD widen papillary orifice . Because bile duct anatomical position acute angle duodenum , assist accessory intraductal anchor balloon , guidewire overtube usually require successful direct POC . Recently , direct peroral cholangioscopes develop free-hand direct advancement endoscope bile duct duodenum . Multibending ultra-slim endoscope may expect facilitate advance bile duct overcome acute angle bile duct duodenum . After randomization enrol patient two group , direct POC perform use conventional slim endoscope control group use multibending endoscope study group .</detailed_description>
