	<brief_title>Assessing Impact Smoke-free Legislation Perinatal Health Netherlands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary research question 1 . Is phased introduction smoke-free legislation The Netherlands associated reduction adverse perinatal outcome ( e.g . perinatal mortality , preterm birth , small gestational age ) ? 2 . How association compare describe European country comparable study ( i.e . Belgium ( Cox 2013 ) , England ( Been et al review ) , Scotland ( Mackay 2012 ) ) ? Study design Retrospective cohort study ( use prospective routinely collect health care data ) Study population All singleton birth Netherlands January 1st 2000 December 31st 2011 . Intervention The intervention study ban smoking workplace , bar restaurant implement Netherlands January 1st , 2004 July 1st , 2008 , respectively . Inclusion exclusion criterion We include registered singleton birth Netherlands occur January 1st , 2000 December 31st , 2011 . This maximum time period surround ban 's introduction require birth data available data source . Multiple pregnancy , neonate chromosomal anomaly , pregnancy unknown gestational age , pregnancy end 24 week pregnancy result birth child weigh less 500 gram exclude . Outcome The primary outcome : - Perinatal mortality ( stillbirth + early neonatal mortality , i.e . within first 7 day life ) - Preterm birth ( live birth gestational age &lt; 37+0 week ) - Small gestational age ( SGA ; live birth birth weight 10th centile ; The Dutch PRN reference curve birth weight gestational age accord parity , sex ethnic background use ) To assess whether smoke-free legislation selective impact certain subgroup outcomes furthermore identified number secondary outcome : - Stillbirth ( bear dead 24+0 week gestation ) - Early neonatal mortality ( live birth death within first 7 day ) - Very preterm birth ( live birth gestational age &lt; 32+0 week ) - Low birth weight ( live birth birth weight &lt; 2500 gram ) - Very low birth weight ( live birth birth weight &lt; 1500 gram ) - Very small gestational age ( live birth birth weight percentile 2.3rd centile ) - Major congenital anomaly ( base report association antenatal smoke exposure ( Hackshaw 2011 ) ) . Data source Individual level health care data extract The Netherlands Perinatal Registry ( PRN ) . Linked midwifery , obstetric , neonatal data available 2000 2011 ( include 2011 ) . Data extraction handle All relevant variable regard outcome , well relevant potential confounders extract database . Sample size Power calculation interrupt time series model complicate give complexity analysis . Similar previous study demonstrate statistically significant clinically relevant effect smoke-free legislation preterm birth ( Cox 2013 ; Mackay 2012 ; Page 2012 ) , low birth weight ( Mackay 2012 ) , SGA ( Mackay 2012 ; Kabir 2013 ) , perinatal mortality ( Mackay et al . Been et al . review ) . Given large population size Netherlands oppose region study carry ( except Been et al . review ) , expect study sufficient power detect similar effect size , present . Statistical analysis Incidences outcome present graphically time period facilitate visualisation temporal fluctuation trend change incidence level . To facilitate timing event , date delivery expect term date require pregnancy . Data present outlined different Tables . Interrupted time series analyse adjustment potential confounders perform assess association implementation smoke-free legislation primary secondary outcome measure . Individual-level analysis perform use logistic regression analysis . The model account underlying temporal trend incidence , allow sudden change incidence ( 'step change ' ) follow introduction smoke ban . We test adjust non-linearity underlying time trend , seasonality account appropriate . Sensitivity analysis ( primary outcome ) In recent year , gestational age usually estimate base early ultrasonography finding , reliable estimation base last menstrual period . Although method ascertainment record PRN , item indicate 'certainty ' gestational age , positive 93 % record . For primary outcome preterm birth SGA perform sensitivity analysis include case gestational age estimation consider reliable accord item . Recent perinatal management change implement The Netherlands result increase active management baby bear edge viability ( i.e . 23-24 week gestation ) ( NVOG 2010 ) . This result increased survival gestational age well altered management 25-26 week infant , likely affect number baby bear preterm ( although effect expect small give small percentage preterm baby bear stage ) , well mortality indicator . For primary outcome preterm birth perinatal mortality therefore perform sensitivity analysis exclude baby bear 26 complete week gestation . Smoking pregnancy know underreported PRN database . Definitions different caregiver differ ; ( ) smoke heavy smoking ( &gt; 20 cigarette daily ) . We consider perform subgroup analysis impact smoke-free legislation primary outcome accord maternal smoking status pregnancy . In sensitivity analysis investigate whether smoke-free legislation differential impact spontaneous preterm birth versus medically indicated preterm birth . All analysis perform use Stata 13.0 .</detailed_description>
