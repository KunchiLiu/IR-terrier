	<brief_title>Gulhane Military Medical Academy Ethical Committee Exercise Program Pregnant Women With Low Back Pelvic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design The study prospective randomize trial control group ( standard care group ) intervention group , use repeat measure design . Forty-eight pregnant participant pregnancy-related LBPP include control group 48 pregnant participant pregnancy-related LBPP include intervention ( exercise ) group . Participants This research perform December 2011 May 2012 Department Obstetrics Gynecology , Gulhane Military Medical Education Research Hospital Ankara , Turkey . Approximately 3,000 birth occur annually clinic . Participants pregnant woman present obstetrics department routine pregnancy examination , pregnancy-related LBPP fulfil eligibility criterion . Eligibility criteria research determine following literature review . The eligibility criterion ; - Age 18 year old - Ability read write Turkish , - Volunteering participate study , - Being 20-35 week gestation , - Having complication reason study , - No diagnosis low back and/or pelvic disease prior pregnancy , - Not perform exercise half hour least three day week pregnancy , - Not use analgesic low back pelvis pain , - Not use method treatment low back pelvic pain , - Giving birth completion study Interventions Participants diagnose pregnancy-related LBPP doctor medical obstacle participation study direct nurse . The nurse invite pregnant woman research room discussion low back pelvic pain . After eligibility criterion pregnant woman review , initial assessment complete participant subsequently randomize . The nurse give health counseling participant intervention group prevention pregnancy-related LBPP initiated exercise program include exercise training . The health counseling exercise train booklet provide prepared base literature . Each counsel session last average 45 minute . Sessions complete positive education atmosphere face-to-face consistent principle adult education . The structure function vertebra , physical change occur pregnancy , cause pregnancy-related LBPP , problem pain cause , method pain management , correct posture development , body mechanic activity daily life ergonomics explain pregnant woman use illustrated booklet give training . During counseling , nurse receive information participant regard daily activity educate participant behavior might damage low back pelvic region . Participants give practical demonstration move protect low back pelvic region daily life . For example , nurse demonstrate retrieve object ground , reach shelf , sit stand lie , guide participant activity well . The participant ' question answer , give educational booklet . Following health consultation , exercise education give . The participant give illustrated booklet explain effect pregnancy exercise maternal fetal health , situation need attention start exercise , sign danger , do potentially dangerous situation , breathe exercise method , frequency amount exercise . The exercise give intervention group base guideline `` Exercise Pregnancy '' Royal College Obstetricians Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) guideline `` Pregnancy Exercise '' Hacettepe University Turkey . It emphasize pregnant woman complete exercise show least three day week 30 minute . The duration exercise program four week . Participants offer choice two type exercise accord weather condition . The first option comprise exercise perform mattress , include stretching , tighten loosen movement target large muscle group neck vertebra . The nurse explain mattress exercise would start 5 minute warm , continue least 15-20 minute mid-tempo end 5 minute cool . The second option walk exercise . The participant expect warm 5 minute , increase speed 5 minute , continue mid-tempo 15 minute complete 5 minute cool . It emphasize pulse rate 120-160/min participant reach mid-tempo . In exercise program , assume walk exercise mattress exercise equal effect low back pelvic pain . Pregnant woman able choose type exercise accord wish requirement could use either exercise option . The nurse determine exercise plan pregnant woman , create individual exercise program accord patient 's personal characteristic . The participant ask record type duration complete exercise program data collection form ask note encounter problem program . The nurse taught participant fill form answer question program . The nurse spoke pregnant woman phone three time week give counsel accord need . During interview , pregnant woman remind complete data collection form . After four week , researcher make final assessment pregnant woman collect form face-to-face interview . The exercise program terminate point , though pregnant woman able continue counsel wish . The pregnant woman control group receive usual care , comprise routine clinical practice pregnancy-related LBPP . The control group participant recommend bed rest analgesic LBPP give treatment LBPP addition standard care . Pregnant woman control group exercise study study . The nurse spoke woman control group phone week ask assess LBPP complete data collection form . The final assessment participant make face-to-face interview four week later . Willing pregnant woman control group advise pain management strategy completion four week study . Sample size statistical power consideration The sample size calculate use PS Software : Power Sample Size program . Using literature , calculate sample size 48 pregnant woman exercise group control group ( total 96 pregnant woman ) could allow detection difference VAS score 10 mm intervention control group , give SD 15 mm accompany 0.95 % confidence interval ( CI ) power 0.90 . Randomization According CONSORT requirement , participant randomly allocate either intervention group ( n=48 ) control group ( n=48 ) use opaque , seal envelopes simple randomization method . The nurse clinic randomly draw envelope break seal nursing room . The nurse explain study 's purpose procedure pregnant woman control intervention group . The procedure repeat pregnant woman . Blinding participant feasible due study design . Primary outcomes The primary outcome study change pain intensity end four week compare baseline change functional status end week first fourth . Data collection The nurse collect data meeting pregnant woman begin end study total two interview . The data collection form include sociodemographic characteristic pregnant woman , pregnancy history , question regard history pain . In meeting nurse measure severity LBPP determine functional status pregnant woman . The participant measure severity LBPP end week total 4 measurement record pain `` Weekly Pain Follow-up Form '' . Additionally , participant intervention group record exercise `` Daily Exercise Form '' . The form collect evaluation nurse completion study . Measures Pain Intensity We use Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) measure intensity participant ' pain . The VAS reliable valid scale widely use world assessment pain intensity . Pregnant woman note severity low back pelvic pain perceive 100 mm VAS . The nurse determine intensity pain measure point pregnant woman mark ruler . We examine intensity two type pain ; perceive pain intensity rest VASrelaxation perceive pain intensity activity VASactivity . Functional Level The Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) use determine participant ' functional status . The ODI develop 1976 O'Brien condition-specific outcome measure use management spinal disorder . The ODI broadly test find good psychometric property useful wide variety setting . The ODI 'gold standard ' low back functional outcome instrument , self-administered consist 10-item questionnaire . The first section evaluate intensity pain others describe disable effect typical daily activity include personal care activity ( wash , dress ) , lift , walk , sit , stand , sleep , social life travel . Each item score 0 5 , high value demonstrate great disability . The ODI 's validity reliability Turkish population examine Yakut et al . ( 2004 ) Cronbach Î± value report 0.91 . Exercise Level Exercise diaries easy , cost-effective frequently use method measure physical activity . In study , exercise diary use determine exercise level participant intervention group . Exercise 30 minute least 3 day week consider sufficient . Ethical Considerations An Academy Ethical Committee approve study design , protocol inform consent procedure number 1491-348-11/1539-227 . Participants inform study inclusion could decline participate time . The participant read sign informed consent form help nurse begin study . Data Analysis Based intention-to-treat principle , pregnant woman analyze accord group assign , regardless whether receive intervention . Missing data impute . To investigate difference group , Student 's test use value normal distribution Mann-Whitney U test use value without normal distribution . To investigate difference within group , pair sample test use value normal distribution Wilcoxon test use value without normal distribution . Repeated measurement result normal distribution analyze use Friedman Test . The error level analysis set p = 0.05 . The result analyze use SPSS , version 15.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .</detailed_description>
