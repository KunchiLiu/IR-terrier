	<brief_title>Sensory Feedback Touch Proprioception With Prosthetic Limbs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In investigator research investigator seek understand organization ( function/operation ) sensory neural system order develop method restore function injured population . One primary focus area investigator research work integrate physiologically relevant sensory feedback prosthetic limb . To end investigator employ variety approach interweave discipline electrophysiology , psychophysics , biomedical engineering cognition . The investigator research team compose interconnected communicative network clinician , engineer , scientist . This help u provide pathway basic science discovery use address clinical need transition directly patient care .</detailed_description>
