	<brief_summary>Spinal anesthesia widely perform use surface landmark base 'blind ' technique . Multiple pass attempt administer spinal anesthesia associate great incidence post dural-puncture headache , paraesthesia spinal hematoma . Real time pre-procedural neuraxial ultrasound technique use improve success rate spinal anesthesia . The use real time ultrasound-guided spinal anesthesia date limit case series case reports.Its use may limit requirement wide bore needle technical difficulty associate simultaneous ultrasound scan needle advancement . The use pre-procedural ultrasound show increase first pass success rate spinal anesthesia patient difficult surface anatomic landmark . No technique show improve success rate dural puncture apply routinely patient . Routine use pre-procedure ultrasound guide paramedian approach result 50 % reduction number pass require spinal anaesthetic , study Cork University Hospital ( await publication ) . L5-S1 wide interlaminar space provide minimal contribution overall movement lumbar spine.This interspinous space might still accessible even patient minimal spine flexion . We also note spinal needle insertion via L5-S1 interspace associate few pass pre-procedure guide ultrasound group ( although non-significant ) . We hypothesise routine use pre-procedural ultrasound-guided paramedian spinal technique L5S1 interspinous space result few needle pass enter subarachnoid space compare conventional landmark base midline approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Landmark Guided Midline Versus Pre-procedural Ultrasound Guided Paramedian L5S1 Spinal Anaesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomise , control study . All consent patient schedule undergo elective total knee total hip arthroplasty spinal anesthesia include study . A write informed consent obtain patient participate study . Patients contraindication spinal anesthesia ( allergy local anesthetic , coagulopathy , local infection indeterminate neurological disease ) exclude study . The patient randomise use random number generate software ( Research Randomizer Version 4.0 ) undergo either conventional landmark-guided spinal anesthesia ( Group C ) pre-procedural ultrasound-guided paramedian L5S1 spinal ( Group P ) . Group allocation conceal enclose code seal opaque envelope see attend anesthesiologist immediately performing procedure . Patients blind allocated study group . In group , spinal anesthesia perform one three consultant anesthesiologist ( FL , PL , GI ) , perform 75 neuraxial ultrasound scan prior study . On arrival anesthesia induction room baseline monitoring ( non-invasive blood pressure , pulse oximetry 3 lead ECG ) intravenous access establish . The patient position sit level trolley foot rest foot rest . They give pillow hug request maintain arch back posture assistant hold patient aid positioning . In group C , anesthesiologist palpate landmark position graded ease palpation 4 point scale ( easy , moderate , difficult impossible ) describe previous studies.10 Strict asepsis follow throughout procedure anesthesiologist scrub prior procedure , wear mask sterile glove . The skin prepped 2 % Chlorhexidine ( Chloraprep 3 ml applicator , CareFusion Corporation , San Diego , CA 92130 , USA ) follow 2-5 ml 1 % lidocaine use infiltrate skin . The anesthesiologist perform spinal technique allow choose appropriate needle length ( 90 119 mm 25 G Whitacre needle , Becton , Dickinson Company , Franklin Lakes , New Jersey , 07417-1880 , USA ) , gauge ( 25 22G ) , depth angle insertion . Hyperbaric bupivacaine use group . After completion spinal anesthetic injection , position patient lateral decubitus , ultrasound use identify interspinous level injection administer . In group P , portable ultrasound unit curve 2-5 MHz probe use initial pre-procedural marking . A paramedian sagittal oblique view neuraxis obtain sacrum identify , follow interlaminar space L5 S1 note . At interspace probe position obtain clear ultrasound image anterior complex ( ligamentum flavum dura complex- LFD ) posterior complex ( posterior longitudinal ligament- PLL ) possible , skin marker use mark midpoint long border probe midpoint short border probe . The medial angulation probe also note guide insertion spinal needle . At horizontal level midpoint long border probe , midpoint line draw two short border midpoint probe use paramedian insertion point spinal needle . A transverse median ( TM ) view level also obtain midline mark . This mark use aid medial angulation spinal needle . Both PSO TM view would grade good ( LFD PLL visible ) , intermediate ( either LFD PLL visible ) poor ( LFD PLL visible ) .15 Following skin marking , care take make sure needle entry site free ultrasound gel prior needle insertion . In group P , anesthesiologist palpate landmark grade spinal injection complete . Spinal anesthesia perform aseptic manner mention earlier . In group anesthesiologist give option use alternative method unsuccessful 3 attempt . For patient group C another interspinous space could use ultrasound employed . For patient group P midline approach conventional landmark palpation technique could use . The outcome note single observer patient . Due nature study , observer blind group . A timer use record various time interval . Time identify landmark group C define time anesthesiologist start palpate identify landmark completion process declare anesthesiologist . In group P define time ultrasound probe place skin anesthesiologist declare marking complete . Time take perform spinal anesthetic define time take insertion introducer needle completion injection . The number pass , define number forward advancement spinal needle give interspinous space ( i.e . withdrawal redirection spinal needle without exit skin ) number spinal needle insertion attempt ( define number time spinal needle withdrawn skin reinserted ) noted.10 The number pass attempt record either completion spinal anesthetic anesthesiologist convert alternate technique . Incidence radicular pain , paraesthesia blood spinal needle also note . All patient experience paraesthesia radicular pain follow next 24 hour patient persistent symptom evaluate per department protocol . In group follow administration spinal anesthesia , patient position either leave right lateral position depend site surgery . After position prior administration sedation , patient ask peri-procedural pain score measure use 11 point verbal rating scale ( 0=no pain , 10=most pain imaginable ) peri-procedural discomfort score measure use 11 point verbal rating measure ( 0= discomfort , 10=most discomfort imaginable ) . Level block ( loss cold sensation ) note 30 minute spinal anesthetic injection . Type dose sedation ( Midazolam +/- Propofol infusion ) leave discretion anesthesiologist . Study Outcomes The primary outcome difference number pass two group . Secondary outcome include follow , 1 . Number spinal needle insertion attempt 2 . Time identify landmark 3 . Time take perform spinal anesthetic 4 . Level block 5 . Incidence radicular pain , paraesthesia blood spinal needle . 6 . Peri-procedural pain 7 . Peri-procedural discomfort score Statistics Based previous study group consultant do CUH , average number pass group C 6.4 +/-8.6 ( mean +/- SD ) . We hypothesise use pre-procedural paramedian spinal do L5S1 , number pass could reduce 1.5 . Fourty eight patient group need achieve power 0.8 type 1 error &lt; 0.05 . We hop randomise 60 patient per group allow dropout . All data analyse base intention treat . Data visually inspect normality . Categorical data analyse use Chi-square test . Normally distributed parametric data analyse use Students-t test ( two group ) ANOVA ( 2 group ) . A p value le 0.05 consider significant . SPSS version 20 used statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
