There n't case wild type poliovirus 2 since 1999 , case wild type poliovirus 3 since November 2012 . However , paralytic polio result circulate strain Sabin poliovirus type 2 become challenge , report several area low population immunity polio , include Pakistan .

	<brief_title>Polio End-game Strategies - Poliovirus Type 2 Challenge Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The `` Polio Endgame Strategy '' consist set task activity implement next five year . It include gradual withdrawal widely use oral poliomyelitis vaccine ( OPV ) contain live poliovirus , eventually lead complete eradication containment wild , vaccine-related ( VDPV ) Sabin polioviruses . The withdrawal type 2 component trivalent OPV ( tOPV ) key component elimination cVDPVs . This entail strengthen immunization system introduce least one dose affordable IPV routine immunization schedule globally replace trivalent OPV bivalent OPV OPV-using country - setting stage eventually end bOPV use 2019-2020 . Most developing country OPV schedule however many develop European country follow IPV schedule . The current recommendation polio eradication endgame IPV vaccine administer together third OPV dose , country occur 14 week age . This study ass protection type 2 poliovirus achieve completion recommend schedule bOPV IPV ; compare immunogenicity bOPV + IPV schedule tOPV schedule ; quantify cross-reactivity bOPV induce type 2 immunological reaction . In addition , also provide first data propose outbreak response type 2 ( either mOPV 2 combination mOPV 2 IPV 2 ) . This study provide data National Immunization Authorities order make strategic decision polio vaccination schedule anticipation global tOPV bOPV switch provide data propose response type 2 poliovirus outbreak .</detailed_description>
