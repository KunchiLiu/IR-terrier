	<brief_summary>Anemia decrease blood count lower normal hemoglobin ( hgb ) , major health problem patient heart surgery . Hemoglobin part blood carry oxygen lung rest body . Anemia present surgery , call preoperative anemia , risk factor increase chance morbidity ( illness ) and/or mortality ( death ) heart surgery . It also important indicator blood transfusion necessity . Recent clinical research investigation do study preoperative anemia suggest blood transfusion damage immune system ( system protect u disease ) lead infection , organ dysfunction ( especially heart , kidney , brain ) , prolong hospital stay , well increased supply , resource cost surgical patient . Comprehensive anemia management reduce eliminate need blood transfusion provide good outcomes surgery . Therefore , control anemia surgery extremely important , could lifesaving measure . This pilot , feasibility study do several reason . First , test safety effectiveness use short-course two medication , erythropoietin ( EPO ) Feraheme ( iron give intravenously [ IV ] ) , increase hemoglobin level order improve preoperative anemia , reduce transfusion low postoperative complication anemic patient undergo heart surgery . Secondly , finding use design large randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The RCT establish protocol actively manage anemia surgery , thus reduce transfusion surgery improve recovery afterwards . It also help identify valuable information regard need do timely completion plan RCT . EPO medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use treat anemia patient certain condition order reduce blood transfusion . And although approve use surgery , FDA approve use cardiac ( heart ) vascular ( blood vessel , include vein artery ) surgery . Common side effect include nausea , vomit , itch , headache , injection site pain , chill , deep vein thrombosis ( blood clot ) , cough , change blood pressure ( BP ) . Feraheme iron replacement product approve treatment low iron anemia adult patient . It may cause serious allergic reaction , include anaphylaxis ( severe , whole body allergic reaction ) , well low BP excessive iron storage . Patients meet eligibility requirement consent participate randomize study . Randomization place chance ( like flip coin ) one two study group , treatment group control group . There equal chance place either group , do computer . 1 . The Treatment Group receive 300 unit ( U ) per kilogram ( kg ) injection EPO 510 milligram ( mg ) IV infusion Feraheme 7-28 day day surgery . And 1-7 day day surgery , second dose medication give . The third dose , EPO , administer 2 day surgery . Before initiate dose give subsequent dose , laboratory parameter measure assess hemoglobin level response medication . If blood value increase rapidly high , med start , already dose , give . 2 . The Control Group receive preoperative intervention anemia unless lab result show iron deficiency anemia . The control group screen presence iron deficiency anemia evaluate blood laboratory value draw baseline preoperative visit . If lab result indicate iron deficiency anemia , over-the-counter oral iron recommend , take day surgery . In , patient may benefit potentially reduce need blood transfusion . Data collect participant preoperative visit throughout admission , include lab result , medication , vital sign , information procedure , transfusion , problem adverse event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Active Preoperative Anemia Management Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia transfusion independent predictor morbidity mortality cardiac surgical patient population . Even , active preoperative anemia management currently standard care institution . Cost associate erythrocyte transfusion University Texas Southwestern ( UTSW ) University Hospitals exceed twenty million dollar annually , include cost associated treatment know complication red cell transfusion ( renal insufficiency , respiratory failure , infection prolong length stay , etc ) . Fifty percent cardiac surgical population suffer preoperative anemia 79 % patient receive one red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . In contrast , incidence RBC transfusion 35 % without preoperative anemia calendar year 2011-12 . The mechanism injury patient preoperative anemia either duration/intensity anemia exposure resultant organ ischemia , harmful effect erythrocyte transfusion ( ) . Active preoperative anemia management strategy attempt minimize event , , exert additive possibly synergistic effect improve clinical outcome . A randomized control trial utilize standardized transfusion strategy necessary step determine increase preoperative hemoglobin lead improve outcome . A pilot , feasibility study first essential step insure adequacy future trial design answer important question . The APART study conduct test safety efficacy use short-course ( 1-4 week ) EPO plus Feraheme increase erythrocyte mass . The finding use guide design randomize , control trial ( RCT ) examine effect active preoperative anemia management erythrocyte transfusion clinical outcome . The RCT test hypothesis short-course ( 1-4 week ) EPO plus Feraheme superior standard care ( SOC ) reduce transfusion improve outcome anemic patient schedule cardiac surgery . Means standard deviation derive pilot data change hemoglobin level , reticulocyte count difference erythrocyte transfusion clinical outcome analyze possible use sample size calculation large RCT . This pilot also provide information determine logistics timely completion RCT , also address data collection , data management , adherence study protocol , transfusion surveillance strategy classification clinical outcome adverse event . Pilot Study Specific Aims Include : 1 . To determine proportion patient fulfill eligibility criterion study agree part randomize trial short-course EPO plus supplemental Feraheme ( 3 dos give 1-4 week interval prior surgery ) vs. standard care management patient schedule coronary bypass grafting ( CABG ) , valve surgery , CABG/valve surgery . 2 . To determine adherence patient health care team procedure include study protocol ( scheduled appointment , surveillance transfusion strategy ) . 3 . To determine increase hemoglobin level reticulocyte count follow short-course EPO plus supplemental Feraheme 1-4 week interval prior date surgery vs. standard care management patient schedule CABG , valve , CABG/valve surgery . 4 . To assess difference proportion patient receive erythrocyte transfusion number blood product utilized ( RBC , platelets plasma ) peri- post-operative period receive short-course EPO plus supplemental Feraheme vs. standard care management patient schedule CABG , valve CABG/valve surgery . 5 . To determine frequency intensity pre-defined clinical outcome ( mortality , major cardiac , renal , neurological event [ associate anemia ] infection ) peri- post-operative period receive short-course EPO plus Feraheme vs. standard care management patient schedule CABG , valve , CABG/valve surgery . Differences hemoglobin level reticulocyte count baseline day surgery postop day ( POD ) 5 , proportion patient receive transfusion number blood product utilized pre-defined clinical event assess two group . Each patient enrol study 28 day day surgery 30 day follow day surgery . This pilot , feasibility study enroll 50 subject ( 25 per group ) . Both group detail clinical data biological specimen collect . Visits Procedures : - Screening : Patients undergo cardiac surgery ( CABG , valve , CABG/valve ) anemia identify advance operation . Basic feature patient medical surgical history ( i.e . age , gender , type surgery ) screen . If eligible study base inclusion/exclusion criterion , consent study . - Baseline Visit : Data demographic , lab result , vital sign , medical history , current medication , height/weight review record . Randomization computer do patient receive 1st dose study drug , assign , monitor serious reaction ( chest pain , dyspnea , seizure , severe headache , fever , nausea , vomit , diarrhea , increase BP ) . Control group patient evidence iron-deficiency laboratory criterion advise initiate supplementation non-prescription , over-the-counter oral iron preparation ( ferrous sulfate 325 mg , three time day commonly use ) take planned surgical operation . - Pre-op Visit : Patients receive 2nd dose study drug assign . Vital sign ( heart rate , BP , oxygen saturation , temperature ) record drug administration , monitor serious adverse event ; SOC lab result ; reticulocyte count , troponin , creatine kinase-myocardial band ( CK-MB ) sample collect . - Day Surgery : Patient vital sign ( BP , electrocardiogram [ EKG ] , etc ) monitor part standard care . Reticulocyte count , iron panel ( include transferrin , ferritin , total iron binding capacity , iron level ) sample collect . SOC lab result , record transfusion , estimate blood loss , adverse event monitored/recorded . - POD 2 : Troponin , CK-MB , Rotem ( Rotational thromboelastometry ) sample collect . Patients receive study drug , assign , monitor serious event . - POD 1-7 : Vital sign ( BP , EKG , etc ) monitor ; SOC lab result , record transfusion , adverse event monitored/recorded . Estimated blood loss record POD 1 2 . - Other lab collect : POD 1 - reticulocyte count , iron panel , troponin , CK-MB ; POD 2 - troponin , CK-MB , Rotem ; POD 5 - reticulocyte count , iron panel , aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase ( AST/ALT ) ; POD 7 - complete blood count ( CBC ) , reticulocyte count , creatinine ; POD 14 discharge ( whichever come first ) - CBC , creatinine . Transfusion Strategy : Erythrocyte transfusion permit cardiopulmonary bypass , surgery afterwards per protocol , criterion meet . Red cell transfusion give one unit time measurement pre- post-transfusion hemoglobin level along physiologic parameter use assess adequacy organ perfusion . A consensus transfusion threshold establish among anesthesiologist , perfusionists surgeon practice . The transfusion threshold implement protocol reflect current `` standard care ; '' threshold clinician generally believe benefit erythrocyte transfusion outweigh risk . Adherence transfusion strategy record research nurse protocol deviation discuss attend physician record member clinical research team . However , research staff order prohibit erythrocyte transfusion . This left discretion treat physician ( ) he/she deem clinically necessary . Following randomization , patient 's chart clearly label indicate participation study protocol . Surveillance Strategy : The decision initiate continue administer dos EPO base evidence accrue randomize control trial clinical practice guideline provide multiple sub-specialty international society . Substantial heterogeneity exist factor could include surveillance strategy minimize risk thrombotic event setting ; one strategy proven superior . The surveillance strategy include protocol derives , believe , current safety analysis perioperative EPO use reflect literature . Implementing surveillance method intend minimize possibly rare potentially life-threatening adverse event . Risk factor consider surveillance strategy include : evidence unstable angina myocardial infarction , recent thrombotic event , hemoglobin level associate high risk myocardial event , excessive thrombocytosis laboratory evidence hypercoagulable postoperative state . EPO dose stratify base patient risk ( degree perioperative anemia ) , type procedure ( CABG vs. valve ) laboratory data ( hgb , Rotem ) . All dos give per surveillance guideline . Primary End Point : The primary objective ass enrollment rate adherence dose protocol surveillance strategy . We define successful adherence adherence dose 90 % patient 90 % dos deem appropriate surveillance strategy . Secondary outcome include change hemoglobin level reticulocyte count within two group baseline day surgery POD 5 , number RBC unit transfuse , frequency pre-specified clinical outcome incidence adverse event study group . Data pilot study use power analysis design large RCT . Adverse event ( AEs ) event involve physiological , social , psychological harm subject risk harm additional subject others . AEs include expect unexpected harmful effect , unexpected risk interaction intervention . AEs may cause : test article test procedure , aspects interaction intervention , subject 's underlying condition , subject 's concurrent standard treatment . AEs may definitely relate , probably relate , possibly relate , unlikely relate , definitely relate research . We report adverse event reportable incidence Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) per report guideline . Any adverse event document event include description , subject number , date , outcome , follow-up . The primary safety endpoint study incidence adverse event associate use study medication . These include : hypersensitivity ( e.g . pruritis , rash , urticaria ) , hypertension , hypotension , bleeding , nausea , vomit , injection site pain , deep venous thrombosis thrombotic complication . Surveillance adverse event conduct direct observation ( drug administration ) , daily bedside visit research nurse first 7 postoperative day , review patient medical record listing complication Society Thoracic Surgery ( STS ) database . The definition stroke , myocardial infarction ( MI ) , mesenteric artery occlusion peripheral vascular event base STS criterion . Any event result death time initial drug administration hospital discharge record . The Principal Investigator , along Secondary Investigators , responsible monitoring , review analysis study data .
