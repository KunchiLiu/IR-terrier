	<brief_summary>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) result blockages artery ( blood vessel ) legs decrease blood flow leg . This may cause difficulty pain walk activity use leg muscle . Exercise may help improve blood flow leg improve ability walk . This research project implement adult PAD examine effect exercise weight loss program low extremity blood flow , health , physical function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This pilot study seek gather data different exercise intervention PAD . Collectively , propose study gather data role novel exercise intervention PAD receive conservative treatment well undergone endovascular intervention lower extremity arterial disease . We hypothesize patient undergo exercise intervention : A ) show improve low extremity perfusion B ) improve functional ability , compare standard care control group 6 month follow-up . We hypothesize improvement mediate angiogenesis increase perfusion lower limb , well improvement muscle strength , mass , function .</detailed_description>
