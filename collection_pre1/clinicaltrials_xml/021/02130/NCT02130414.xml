	<brief_title>PK , Safety &amp; Tolerability CyCol® Versus Sandimmune® Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , multiple-dose , multi-stage pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study . A maximum 40 healthy adult male volunteer age 18 55 year enrol single clinical research unit . For CyCol® group dose last 7 day , whilst Sandimmun® IV group single dose 24 hour . Single dose pharmacokinetics different dos CyCol® compare IV Sandimmun® . In addition colonic tissue concentration compare multiple dos CyCol® single IV dose Sandimmun® . Concentrations unchanged cyclosporine 's metabolite faeces also explore . Stage 1 study investigate 75mg dose ( OD BID ) CyCol® IV Sandimmun® . Then dependent result Stages 2 3 investigate either low ( 37.5mg ) high ( 150mg ) dose level . The dose regimen choose Stages 2 3 base upon safety tolerability , systemic exposure colonic mucosa tissue concentration observe dos .</detailed_description>
