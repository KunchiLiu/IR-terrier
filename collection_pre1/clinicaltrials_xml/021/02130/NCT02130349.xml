	<brief_summary>The IBD South Limburg ( IBDSL ) project initially design prospective population base cohort study . Since 1991 , new IBD case enrol cohort prospectively follow . As 2011 , cohort scale population base biobank focus expand epidemiology towards explore underlie biologic mechanism identify marker predict disease course therapy response . Every adult IBD patient , diagnose permanently reside South Limburg ( The Netherlands ) , eligible participate . The population base nature reach via multi-faceted approach ; incident case prospectively identify participate hospital , miss patient retrospectively identify use nationwide histopathology registry . In 2011 , 3500 patient include , represent 93 % IBD population South Limburg . The cohort include baseline data , IBD phenotype , extent , location , behaviour , extra intestinal manifestation , medication , surgery , comorbidity demographic . Data prospectively update chart review ( clinical data ) , questionnaire ( i.e . quality life ) linkage authority database ( vital state , residence ) . The biobank include serum , plasma , DNA , faeces , biopsy exhale air . We welcome new collaboration . Applications collaboration first approve IBD-SL committee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) , encompass Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) , chronic disable condition intestine . Most patient experience sequence exacerbation quality life often impaired . Also society endure heavily , IBD healthcare cost estimate 4.6-5.6 billion euro per year high rate unemployment work disability report . The current incidence estimate 256.000 Europeans per year , yet increase . IBD arise complex interaction genetically alter intestinal immune response , environmental factor intestinal microbiota . Disease phenotypes heterogeneous predict individual disease course therapy response still merely possible ; treatment choice instance remain trial-and-error base succession regimen . Further exploration underlie biologic mechanism , identification validation non-invasive marker predict disease course therapy response foremost challenge IBD field moment . Deeply phenotyped IBD cohort biobank ideal tool type research , warrant . Most IBD biobanks reflect hospital base population thereby represent severe therapy refractory patient . However , many hypothesis require design full IBD spectrum . Secondly , phenotype mostly ascertain retrospectively , make result prone bias . As prospective population base biobank excists , start population base IBD South Limburg ( IBDSL ) biobank project . IBDSL : The IBDSL project first establish 1991 , gastroenterologist start prospectively register IBD patient reside South Limburg , Netherlands . As 2011 , cohort scale biobank focus expand epidemiology towards explore underlie biologic mechanism identify marker predict disease course therapy response . Population : Every adult IBD patient , diagnose South Limburg 1991 permanently reside South Limburg ( Netherlands ) , eligible participate . The population base nature reach via multi-faceted approach ; incident case prospectively identify participate hospital , miss patient retrospectively identify use nationwide histopathology registry . In 2011 , 3500 patient include , represent &gt; 93 % IBD population South Limburg . Adults partner include patient serve control . Datacollection : All eligible IBD patient contact asked participate . Patients visit home hospital research nurse . After informed consent , DNA , serum , plasma , exhale air stool collect . All data add custommade web-based data management system ( MACRO ) . All biomaterials store central biobank facility MUMC . Additional information : IBDSL Dutch consortium comprise gastroenterology department Maastricht University Medical Centre+ general district hospital Orbis MC Sittard-Geleen Atrium MC Heerlen . IBDSL investigator initiate funded consortium member . IBDSL approve Ethics Committee Maastricht University Medical Centre ( METC 10-2-071 , NL31636.068.10 ) , meet ethical standard declaration Helsinki . We welcome new collaboration . Applications collaboration first approve IBD-SL committee .</detailed_description>
