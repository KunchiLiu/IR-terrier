	<brief_summary>Patients rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) increase risk cardiovascular event . This increase risk think driven inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction , initial step atherogenesis . Treatment TNFalpha inhibitor ( TNFi ) improve endothelial function patient RA . Discontinuation TNFi could therefore worsen endothelial function even absence recurrence systemic inflammation reactivation arthritis . If stop TNFi result worsen endothelial function would strongly suggest high cardiovascular risk association TNFi-wthdrawal</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) increase risk cardiovascular event . This increase risk think driven inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction , initial step atherogenesis . Both systemic well local ( intra-arterial ) treatment anti-TNF-antibody therapy improve endothelial function patient vasculitis RA reflect vasodilator response intra-arterially infused acetylcholine . Also vascular function ( least partially ) endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation brachial artery pulse wave velocity improve active RA patient treat methotrexate plus TNFi , i.e . infliximab etanercept . ( Therefore one may hypothesize TNFi therapy stop , endothelial function may worsen even absence recurrence systemic inflammation reactivation arthritis . Endothelial function test marker long-term cardiovascular mortality . If stop TNFi result worsen endothelial function would strongly suggest high cardiovascular risk association TNFi-wthdrawal . These finding would indicate important drawback stop TNFi RA patient . To date unclear whether worsen endothelial function occur within half year follow ( successful ) cessation TNFi , whether decline occur simultaneously , prior RA exacerbation whether deterioration process delay additional use statin and/or ACEi . To improve cardiovascular prognosis RA significantly important increase knowledge regard process .</detailed_description>
