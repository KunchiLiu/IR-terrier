	<brief_summary>There 3 million annual neonatal death . Approximately 2/3 neonatal death due infection , low birth weight ( LBW ) , prematurity . Low tech high impact intervention commodity use unconventional way could save hundred thousand newborn life . We propose integrated evidence-based toolkit usable community health worker ( CHW ) reduce neonatal death . The kit include : Chlorhexidine apply umbilical stump , sunflower oil emollient apply skin , ThermoSpot identify hypo/hyperthermia , Mylar infant sleeve non-electric warmer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Over 3 million global neonatal death report annually . While significant progress make past decade towards reduce overall 5 mortality , little progress make towards reduction neonatal death , represent 40 % deaths child age 5 . The majority neonatal death occur rural area low-income country approximately two third due infection complication relate low birth weight ( LBW ) prematurity . In Pakistan , estimate 200,000 newborn die year reach end first month life , represent nearly 58 % death among child age five . The risk neonatal death Pakistan high rural area urban area ; neonatal mortality rate ( NMR ) rural area 55 per 1,000 live birth compare 48 per 1,000 live birth urban area . NMR Pakistan also associate poverty ; NMR high wealth quintile 38 compare 63 per 1000 live birth low wealth quintile . In resource poor setting , newborn often deliver home receive minimal specific medical care , measurement , monitoring . In area , geography , infrastructure , poverty often effectively prevent access health center care . Home outreach train Community health worker ( CHWs ) increasingly recognize mainstay provision maternal newborn care setting . Many proven , cost-effective way save life newborn exist , however , always available need package single portable kit easily use home-setting . Such portable kit consist low cost , evidence-based intervention use home tremendous potential improve health status decrease NMR . In study , investigator hypothesize implementation integrate evidence-based toolkit CHWs reduce neonatal death least 40 % reduction infectious cause death associate prematurity LBW . Furthermore , investigator propose additive effect mortality benefit specific kit component . The portable kit contain clean birth kit use time delivery either home facility , 4 % chlorhexidine ( CHX ) lotion , sunflower oil emollient , ThermoSpot , Mylar infant sleeve , reusable , non-electric , heating device . CHWs equip hand hold electric scale identify LBW newborn .</detailed_description>
