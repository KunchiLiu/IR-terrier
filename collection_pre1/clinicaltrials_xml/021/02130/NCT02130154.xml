	<brief_summary>In study investigator aim investigate whether sympathetic stimulation BAT , assess 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission compute tomography compute tomography scan , differs young elderly subject , explanation diminish metabolic brown adipose tissue activity elderly . The investigator hypothesis sympathetic nervous system activity elderly diminish compare young counterpart explanation diminish metabolic brown adipose tissue activity elderly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The sympathetic nervous system primary activator Brown Adipose Tissue . Elderly know less metabolically active brown adipose tissue compare young counterpart . The reason diminish metabolic brown adipose tissue activity unknown . However , low sympathetic nervous system activation brown adipose tissue elderly might explain diminished metabolic brown adipose tissue . Therefore , study , sympathetic nervous system activation brown adipose tissue metabolic activity measure young old subject . sympathetic nervous system activity measure use 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine single-photon emission compute tomography compute tomography scan , metabolic activity measure use 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT scan .</detailed_description>
