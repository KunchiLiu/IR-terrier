	<brief_summary>Rilapladib potent selective inhibitor lipoprotein associate phospholipase A2 ( Lp-PLA2 ) , previously development treatment atherosclerosis currently develop treatment Alzheimer 's disease . This study single-center , open-label , two-part study . The two study part run independently . Subjects dose one part study permit participate part . Part A investigate pharmacokinetic profile rilapladib metabolite , SB-664601 GSK1174379 , single dose steady state dose rilapladib 250 milligram ( mg ) along biliary urinary elimination pathway rilapladib 250 mg. Part B determine effect repeat administration itraconazole PK single oral dose rilapladib 25 mg . Healthy male female subject , age 18-65 year , recruit study . Ten subject recruit Part A 20 subject recruit Part B .</brief_summary>
