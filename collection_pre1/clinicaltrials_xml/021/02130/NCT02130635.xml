	<brief_summary>This randomise , double-blind , placebo control , parallel group study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics dose response multiple dose GSK2269557 administer dry powder COPD subject . Pharmacodynamic effect biomarkers also assess . This study two part . In Part A , subject randomize active placebo treatment 3:1 ratio Part B , placebo one six dos active treatment equal ratio . A sufficient number COPD subject ( male female non-child bearing potential ) screen ensure approximately 30 subject enrol least 20 evaluable subject obtain Part A approximately 35 subject enrol Part B . In part , subject receive study treatment daily 14 consecutive day . Placebo control include valid evaluation adverse event attributable treatment versus independent treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject confirm establish diagnosis COPD , define Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive lung Disease ( GOLD ) guideline . Male female nonchild bear potential 40 75 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . The subject postbronchodilator [ 400 microgram ( mcg ) salbutamol ] Maximal amount air FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 FEV1 &gt; =40 % &lt; =80 % predict ( Predictions accord European Community Coal Steel ( ECCS ) equation ) . Subject smoker exsmoker smoke history least 10 pack year ( pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) ) . The subject able produce &gt; 100 milligram ( mg ) sputum screen . Body weight &gt; =45 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 17 32 kg/square meter ( m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation , hysterectomy , salpingooophrectomy oophrectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 milliInternational unit ( MIU ) /millilitre ( mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram ( pg ) /mL ( &lt; 147 picomole ( pmol ) /Liter [ L ] ) confirmatory ] . [ Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method , wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least 24 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . ] ; samesex partner , prefer usual lifestyle . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication followup visit . Based average QTcF value triplicate ECGs obtain brief recording period ( e.g . 5 minute ) : QTcF &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) ; QTcF &lt; 480 msec subject right bundle branch block . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include investigator [ consultation Glaxosmithkline ( GSK ) medical monitor require ] document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone cholecystectomy ) . Subjects past current medical condition disease well control , judge Investigator , may affect subject safety influence outcome study . ( Note : Patients adequately treat well control concurrent medical condition ( e.g . hypertension ) permit entered study ) . Subject diagnosis active tuberculosis , lung cancer , clinically overt bronchiectasis , pulmonary fibrosis , asthma respiratory condition might , opinion Investigator , compromise safety subject affect interpretation result . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 28 unit male &gt; 21 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram alcohol : halfpint ( approximately 240 mL ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . History sensitivity study medication , component ( lactose ) thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . A positive test Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody test accord local policy . The subject positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . A minimum list drug screen include cannabinoids , amphetamine , barbiturate , cocaine opiate . The detection drug ( e.g . benzodiazepine , opiate ) take legitimate medical purpose would necessarily exclusion study participation . The detection alcohol would exclusion screen would need negative predose study . A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) positive total hepatitis B core antibody ( antiHBc IgM ) positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Pregnant female determine positive urine human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen prior dosing . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Lactating female . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Subject poorly control unstable COPD , define occurrence following : Either : acute worsen COPD ( exacerbation ) manage subject home requiring treatment corticosteroid and/or antibiotic 4 week prior screen visit ; two exacerbation previous 2 month prior screen visit require course oral corticosteroid and/or antibiotic , subject hospitalise . Subject respiratory tract infection treat antibiotic 4 week prior first dose . Subject require regular treatment oral corticosteroid receive oral parenteral corticosteroid within 4 week screen . Vulnerable subject ( e.g. , person keep detention ) . The subject able understand communicate German native language .</criteria>
