	<brief_summary>Background . The prevalence metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) increase , risk positively correlate age . Due age society Taiwan , treat metabolic syndrome decrease complication important health issue . Relatively study focus effect exercise train patient MetS long-term follow-up . Recently , high-intensity interval training aerobic interval training ( AIT ) consist high intensity separate active recovery propose effective isocaloric continuous moderate-intensity exercise ( CME ) raise exercise capacity ( VO2max ) specific patient population . Purpose . The purpose ( 1 ) compare effect 16-week CME AIT reduce number metabolic risk factor patient MetS prevalence . Hypothesis : 16-week AIT reduce metabolic risk factor CME patient MetS . Methods . This study multiple-center trial . One hundred twenty patient , age ≥45 year , diagnosis MetS center recruit . Subjects randomly assign either control , CME , AIT group baseline assessment . Participants control group receive usual care others two exercise group undergo 16-week exercise training . All subject receive 16-week , 6-month 1-year follow-up include blood test , body composition ( body mass index , waist circumference ) , pulse wave velocity , maximal exercise testing . Statistical analysis conduct use SPSS 11.5 , p &lt; 0.05 indicate statistical significance . Data present mean±standard deviation number ( percentile ) intention-to-treat analysis . Chi-square test one-way Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) use compare whether between-group difference baseline . Two-way repeat measure ANOVA post-hoc test perform examine time group effect interaction effect , otherwise Bonferroni use . The subgroup analysis MetS n-MetS training perform use statistical method .</brief_summary>
