	<brief_title>IDA-01 A Randomised , Open-Label , Comparative Study Intravenous Iron Isomaltoside 1000 ( MonoferÂ® ) Iron Sucrose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IDA highly prevalent subject gastrointestinal disease cancer , menstruate pregnant woman , subject undergone bariatric procedure . IDA substantial medical quality life ( QoL ) burden subject treatment subject include control bleed replenish lose iron . Oral iron administration often use clinical practice many clinic ; however , oral iron may tolerate subject . Hence , need alternative iron treatment subject , tolerate oral iron . This study plan compare efficacy safety iron isomaltoside 1000 another parenteral iron preparation ( iron sucrose ) subject IDA intolerant unresponsive oral iron therapy need iron rapidly .</detailed_description>
