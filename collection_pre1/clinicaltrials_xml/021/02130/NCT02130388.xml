	<brief_title>The Impact Zinc Supplementation Innate Immunity Patient Safety Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research show zinc supplementation reduces length severity type medical infection ( example include cold virus diarrhea ) . Because zinc show improve immune system 's function , doctor provide mineral supplement zinc patient Intensive Care Unit . However , study show effective zinc evaluate dose ( ) zinc safe patient severe sepsis/septic shock . Nor study examine tolerable dos septic patient improve immune system function . If zinc show improve immune system function sepsis , could use future part treatment regimen patient sepsis .</detailed_description>
