	<detailed_description>Diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) complication type 1 , `` insulin-dependent , '' diabetes ( T1DM ) define high blood glucose level ( 200 mg/dL ) couple severe acidosis . Children T1DM lack adequate insulin production . Without insulin , glucose use cell produce energy blood glucose level increase . As result , body break fat tissue adequate energy production . This result ketone acid production , ultimately DKA . Often time DKA present time diabetes diagnosis . Recent estimate suggest nearly 30 % child present DKA newly diagnose diabetes . DKA also occur result poorly control T1DM poor adherence insulin therapy . It common patient recurrent episode DKA , may lead permanent brain injury . Cerebral edema ( CE ) , `` brain swelling , '' also occur severe DKA . It unclear cause CE child DKA . Proposed mechanism include change blood flow brain , inflammatory mediation , alteration intracellular extracellular fluid composition brain . CE `` clinically apparent '' `` subclinical '' term symptomatology . Children clinically apparent DKA-related CE present neurologic deficit alter mental status . These child risk herniation brain stem due elevate pressure around brain , ultimately death . The neurologic manifestation clinically apparent DKA-related CE typically occur 4-12 hour initiation medical therapy . However , case report occur prior initiation therapy . Although clinically apparent DKA-related CE rare , occur 0.5-1 % child DKA , subclinical DKA-related CE much common estimate suggest 54 % child DKA underlie CE go clinically undetected . Early identification clinically apparent subclinical DKA-related CE critical time initial neurologic symptom clinical deterioration little 3 hour . Moreover , early identification subclinical DKA-related CE may lead difference medical therapy . Current evaluation DKA-related CE necessitate high index clinical suspicion often time patient receive advanced brain imaging compute tomography ( CT ) scan . While CT scan identify CE , image modality expose patient ionize radiation , expensive , may take considerable time instance . Moreover , CE occur absence acute change CT patient subclinical CE may go unidentified . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use identify subclinical DKA-related CE , however often time-consuming , expensive , require sedation , may unavailable center . Ocular sonography ( ultrasound ) alternative imaging technique provide immediate diagnostic capability bedside minimize radiation exposure . This technique use rapidly accurately detect increase brain swell measurement optic nerve sheath diameter ( ONSD ) number clinical situation include pediatric head trauma , hydrocephalus ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction , altitude sickness adult . It believe , study use ocular ultrasound examine ONSD set diabetes DKA identification clinically apparent subclinical CE . It unclear patient T1DM fundamentally different baseline ONSD measurement compare describe normal value . It also unclear ONSD varies time diabetes-related illness , high blood glucose level without criterion DKA compare unequivocal DKA . Investigators plan conduct prospective study include child age 7-18 year present Children 's Endocrinology Clinic Children 's Emergency Department . The objective study assess utility sonographic measurement ONSD tool identification DKA-related CE . Specifically , primary aim study measure compare mean ONSD child well-controlled T1DM present Emergency Department ( ED ) DKA present ED T1DM hyperglycemia without criterion DKA . Investigators hypothesize mean ONSD measurement small child well-controlled T1DM compare child present ED DKA compare child T1DM hyperglycemia without criterion DKA . Secondarily , investigator aim compare mean ONSD child present ED DKA present ED T1DM hyperglycemia without criterion DKA . The study team hypothesize mean ONSD measurement large child present ED DKA compare child present T1DM hyperglycemia without criterion DKA .</detailed_description>
