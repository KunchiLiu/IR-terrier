	<brief_summary>Adipose diabetic patient glomerular hyperfiltration enhance reabsorption sodium kidney lead fluid retention hypertension . It already know obese mouse ( db/db ) salt retention elevate intrarenal angiotensin II , mechanism salt retention similar one described human being . In experimental study 2009 do Hirata K al. , publish Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications obese type 2 diabetic db/db mouse non-diabetic db/m mouse hypertension artificially induce ( acute sodium-loading angiotensin II-infusion ) . Two group mice treat exendin-4 vehicle 12 week . Obese type 2 diabetic db/db mouse show high salt-sensitivity . Exendin-4 demonstrated anti-hypertensive effect db/db mouse angiotensin II-infused mouse , relate attenuation high salt-sensitivity . That observation confirm exendin-4 , GLP-1 ( Glucagon-like peptide-1 ) analogue , extra-islet effect include regulation salt handle . More ten year mention observation presence GLP 1 receptor confirm body , also kidney . In 2004 Gutzwiller publish study Journal Clinical Endocrinology Metabolism examine 15 healthy subject 16 obese men ( mean body mass index , 36 kg/m2 ) double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study . After overnight fast hypertonic saline infuse follow 3-h infusion GLP-1 . Intravenous infusion GLP-1 enhance sodium excretion , reduce H+ secretion , reduce glomerular hyperfiltration obese men . These finding suggest action proximal renal tubule potential renoprotective effect . Two year later author colleague publish new study Digestion . In part new study observe 8 volunteer . The protocol include intravenous salt load compare effect infusion GLP-to isotonic saline ( placebo ) . Extracellular volume expansion induce intravenous infusion hypertonic saline partially compensated increase urinary sodium water excretion GLP-1 . He explain volume expansion associate increase renal perfusion , rise glomerular filtration filter sodium load . It observe GLP-1 able increase renal sodium excretion 69 % urine volume 86 % . Considering mention obvious GLP-1 natriuretic effect , although exact mechanism clinical usefulness remain unclear . Both GLP1 analogue inhibitor DPP4 ( dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ) , elevate GLP1 level , would surprise observe similar natriuretic effect body . Since GLP 1 peptide give IV . sc . long-term study observe final possible effect blood pressure , GLP1 analogues DPP4 inhibitor enhance incretin action demonstrate antihypertensive property . 2008 study do Mistry GC al. , publish Journal Clinical Pharmacology antihypertensive effect sitagliptin observe . In nineteen patient stable treatment antihypertensive agent ( ) investigator find small statistically significant reduction 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure . There many definitive clue blood pressure droop treatment elevate serum GLP1 . At end 2009 analysis publish American Journal Hypertension , show result six trial include 2,171 subject treat exenatide least 6 . Again , significantly great reduction systolic blood pressure confirm , give explanation happen . Finally , Prof. Sjöholm Karolinska institute Sweden publish Diabetes , obesity metabolism review concern impact GLP-1 endothelial function . He mention decreased blood pressure improvement diuresis natriuresis , also add new element , improve endothelial dysfunction GLP-1 receptor-dependent pathway . Though many speculation , exact antihypertensive effect water homeostasis GLP-1 , also GLP1 analogue DPP4 inhibitor still unknown . Finally , recent review ( Tanaka et ) 2011 confirms mention speculation regard natriuretic effect GLP1 , quote … '' Incretin mimetics DPP-IV inhibitor novel class antihypertensive drug natriuretic property . They use treatment salt-sensitive hypertension , characterize edema . The idea investigate effect GLP1 diuresis/natriuresis compare placebo healthy non-obese people compare natriuresis GLP-1 , BNP ( brain natriuretic peptide ) ADH ( antidiuretic hormone ) level serum .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross-over study . Totally 15 participant randomize ( number later determine power test ) . The duration study 9 day include 3 visit screen visit start study . Screening ( day -1 ) Inclusion criterion fulfil approach Visit 1 screening . Participants instruct come next day fast collect 24h urine sample . Visit 1 ( day 1 ) Participant voluntarily agree participate give informed write consent . Baseline study assessment go perform fasting : blood count differential , blood chemistry ( liver enzymes , sodium , potassium , calcium , phosphorus , magnesium , chloride , serum amorality , urea creatinine , lipid panel include cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL LDL cholesterol , coagulation , uric acid , glucose insulin , renin activity , aldosterone , GLP1 level , T4 TSH-thyroid stimulate hormone , ADH , BNP ) In 24 h urine collection sodium , chloride calcium excretion , osmolality , creatinine go measure , glomerular filtration go assessed creatinine clearance , urin analysis microscopy go preform , EKG , kidney ultrasound together 24-h blood pressure monitor . HOMA2 ( The Homeostasis Model Assessment ) index calculate total body water percentage determinated via Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis . All sample renin activity aldosterone study go take horizontal position least 3 hour . Participants go randomized regard glucose tolerance test . First group one fasting glucose 4,5 -5,7 mmol/L 2 hour OGTT ( amount sodium OGTT fluid use 0,4 mg sodium 0,3 mg chloride 0,2 L water ) glucose level 7.8 mmol/l . The group one fasting glucose 5,7 7 mmol/l and/or 2 hour OGTT glucose level form 7.8 mmol/l 11,1 mmol/L ( venous sample ) . Patients instruct come next day fast . Visit 2 ( day 2 ) next study assessment : 24-h blood pressure monitor remove , overnight fast oral saline load go give form standardized meal ( soup ) amount 12 g NaCl ( average daily intake salt Croatia ) . The soup go consume 30 minute . Volunteers go instructed drink afterwards 1/2 L water next 1 h. Placebo form iv infusion hypertonic saline go give rate 0.06 ml/kg/in infuse 3 hour begin oral sodium load . During 6 hour ( oral sodium load ) urine gong collect . Finally , blood sample go drawn glucose , insulin , sodium , potassium , serum osmolality , serum creatinine , renin activity , aldosterone , BNP , ADH GLP1 level 3 6 hour . Sodium , chloride calcium excretion , osmolality creatinine go measure urine 3 hour . Patients instruct come 7 day fast . Visit 3 ( day 9 ) overnight fast oral sodium load go give form standardized meal ( soup ) amount previous day consume 30 minute , go drink afterwards 1/2 L water next 1 h like pervious day . Synthetic GLP-1 ( 1.5 pmol/kg/min ) dissolve 500 ml 0.9 % saline go infuse 3 hour begin oral sodium load . During 6 hour ( oral sodium load ) urine gong collect , blood sample go drawn 3 6 hour analysis Visit 2 , like urine collection 6 hour .</detailed_description>
