	<brief_title>In Clinic Evaluation PLGM Feature</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 95 subject type 1 diabetes ( age 14-75 year old ) enrol 8 investigational center order reach minimum 60 subject complete study ( N=minimum 40 adult subject , 22-75 year old ) N=minimum 15 pediatric subject ( 14-21 year old ) . Subjects evaluate in-clinic set induction hypoglycemia increase basal rate use standardize titration tool refer protocol rate change basal increase algorithm ( Buckingham , Diabetes Care 5 , 2010 ) . Total duration frequent sample test ( FST ) use Yellow Springs Instrument ( YSI ) may 19 hour . Subjects undergo in-clinic testing Sensor Day 1 . All subject undergo hypoglycemic induction Visit 2 target set 65 mg/dL use rate change basal increase algorithm . Low Limit set PLGM ON 65 mg/dL . The In-Clinic part study consist hypoglycemic induction observation period . Hypoglycemic induction end one follow 3 criterion meet , whichever come first : 1 . PLGM activate 2 . YSI glucose less equal 65 mg/dL , follow next YSI sample less equal 65 mg/dL ( 2 contiguous YSI sample ) . 3 . Neither condition # 1 # 2 meet 12 hour Observation YSI end : 1 . If PLGM activate , observation YSI frequent sample test include Suspend period ( 30 minute minimum 2 hour maximum ) insulin resumption period ( approximately 4 hour time insulin delivery resume ) . This may include insulin re-suspension period . Maximum observation YSI frequent sample test long 19 hour . 2 . YSI glucose less equal 65 mg/dL follow next YSI sample less equal 65 mg/dL ( 2 contiguous YSI sample ) . The subject rescue YSI observation end 3 . Twelve hour pass since start hypoglycemic induction without PLGM activation 4 . See In-Clinic Stopping rule Enrollment study proceed phase . Phase 1 allow enrollment adult subject ( 22-75 year ) . Subjects wear pump system , show : - One Study Pump - One GST-3C Transmitter - One Enlite 3 Sensor Progression Phase 2 may occur 10 adult subject complete Phase 1 Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) approve safe continue Phase 2 . Phase 2 enrollment involve minimum 15 pediatric subject ( 14-21 ) . Subjects wear pump system show Phase 1 . A total 95 subject enrol 10 investigational center order reach minimum 60 subject ( N=minimum 40 adult subject N=minimum 15 pediatric subject ) complete study . Considering around 15 % screen failure rate approximately 15 % drop-out rate , total 95 subject enrol order 60 subject complete study . 1 . The investigational center encourage include subject different ethnicity include Hispanic , Native American , African-American 2 . Subjects group cohort Age The study anticipate last longer 12 month investigational center initiation completion data entry monitoring procedure include final report . Subjects expect participate approximately 2-3 week .</detailed_description>
