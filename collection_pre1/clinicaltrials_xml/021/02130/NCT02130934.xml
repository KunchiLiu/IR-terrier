	<detailed_description>The following test procedure perform consent obtain . All test procedure note do sole purpose study : Visit 1 . Subjects ask complete questionnaire answer question regard smoking status use alcohol smokeless tobacco . We also gather basic information age , height , weight , gender , ethnicity , race , pertinent medical history well collect vital sign information ( height , weight , blood pressure , heart respiratory rate . ) Next , subject undergo routine transthoracic echocardiogram . Visit 2 . Following completion echocardiogram , select take part study , subject schedule cardiac MRI test within 3 month period . When subject come Visit 2 , receive 12 lead electrocardiograph ( ECG ) cardiac 3D MRI . All female capable become pregnant , except age 11 , undergo urine pregnancy test . If find pregnant allow study . If female 18 positive pregnancy test result obtain , inform participant parent/guardian . Subjects may place `` simulated '' MRI teach like enter scanner also train breathe calmly regularly scan . Training involve use PrimeSense 3D sensor , similar camera use active videogame system Xbox Kinect , generate 3D picture chest breathe . Following training session , subject undergo cardiac 3D MRI . Study participation end visit .</detailed_description>
