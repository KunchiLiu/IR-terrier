	<detailed_description>There need improve decision-making antibiotic prescription acute suspect infection . Infections , particularly early stage , protean manifestation , often manifest `` classic '' sign , clinically overlap non-infectious condition . However , imperative quickly give antibiotic bacterial infection lead antibiotic overuse resistance . Strategies combine novel diagnostics therapeutic improve decision-making oncology , cardiology , field . These strategy aim identify patient likely help harm therapeutic intervention allow individualize care . This approach take diagnostics next level , demand test measure well , also clinical care improve tying test treatment strategy . Procalcitonin , novel biomarker bacterial infection , may help physician make appropriate antibiotic decision . Lower respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) ideal trial population . LRTI account large proportion antibiotic prescription , exemplifies imprecise clinical phenotype infection.However , key question generalizability safety preclude widespread application .</detailed_description>
