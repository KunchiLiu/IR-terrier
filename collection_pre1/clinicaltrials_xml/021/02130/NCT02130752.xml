	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer one common gastrointestinal cancer , radical resection primary lesion combine dissection regional lymph-nodes acknowledge surgeon world . By invented adopt energy surgical instrument , surgical procedure safer easier . The newly surgical instrument reduce post-operative mortality morbidity combine easy procedure surgery . As popular instrument use gastric surgery , ultrasonic scalpel monopolar electrocautery receive lot attention concern . Some study show advantage two instrument , facilitate surgical treatment make surgery safer effective . Although , small retrospective sample report claim ultrasonic scalpel bring benefit blood loss , dissection lymph-node intraoperative complication even postoperative complication . And Korea small sample randomize control trail presentation ultrasonic scalpel reduce blood loss surgical duration . However , postoperative complication statistical significance two instrument . Cost- effective analysis energy instrument still controversial . Large sample randomize control trail high quality need . By reason , multicenter randomize control trial conduct 9 hospital North South China aim compare clinical characteristic outcome , use ultrasonic scalpel monopolar electrocautery traditional open gastrectomy . The aim study evaluate outcome ultrasonic scalpel compare monopolar electrocautery D2 distal gastrectomy , include , intraoperative parameter , postoperative complication , cost data , post-operative quality life .</brief_summary>
