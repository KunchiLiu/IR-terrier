	<brief_summary>Background : - Eosinophils white blood cell help fight infection . High eosinophil level damage people organ , cause hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) . Researchers want study drug benralizumab help people HES . Objective : - To test benralizumab safely decrease eosinophil people HES . Eligibility : - Adults age 18-65 stable HES therapy least 1 month still symptoms high eosinophil level . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , urine blood test . They take simple heart lung test . - Participants also bone marrow biopsy . A numbing medicine inject outer cover bone . Then needle insert bone . A fast suction movement take bone marrow cell . - Phase 1 : Participants randomly receive either study drug placebo injection . - They daily visit next 3 day , 4 weekly visit , 4 biweekly visit . Each time , medical history , physical exam , blood test , check side effect . - They receive another dose study drug placebo 1 month 2 month first injection . - Phase 2 repeat Phase 1 schedule . All participant receive study drug . - At 1 visit , participant also receive vaccine . At 4 visit , repeat heart lung test . They also one bone marrow biopsy . - After week 24 , participant receive study drug either 6 time 6 month twice 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Benralizumab Subjects With Hypereosinophilic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) rare group heterogeneous disorder characterize marked peripheral eosinophilia ( &gt; 1500/ ( micro ) L ) evidence eosinophil-associated tissue damage . Although high proportion patient respond initially corticosteroid therapy , high dos often necessary control eosinophilia clinical symptom , many patient become relatively refractory therapy and/or develop serious side effect . IL-5 receptor ( alpha ) ( IL-5R ( alpha ) expression human restrict eosinophil , basophil , mast cell precursor , therefore , ideal target therapy HES . To date , safety concern benralizumab ( anti-IL-5R ( alpha ) ) phase 1 , 2 3 trial asthma efficacy data promising . In order explore safety efficacy benralizumab treatment HES , 20 adult ( men non-pregnant woman , 18-75 year age ) HES symptomatic AEC &gt; 1000/ ( micro ) L stable HES therapy least 1 month recruit randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind phase 2 trial . Benralizumab ( 30 mg ) placebo administer sc week 0 , 4 , 8 . Eosinophil count blind subject background HES therapy taper subject study 13 week . At week 12 , 16 , 20 , subject receive sc injection benralizumab . Subjects demonstrate response 24 week visit ( eosinophil count &lt; 1000/ ( alpha ) L stable improve clinical symptom without increase background HES therapy ) continue receive additional 30 mg sc injection every 4 week . Following initial dose benralizumab placebo first open-label dose benralizumab , subject follow daily 3 day , weekly 4 week , every 2 week 8 week . Subsequent visit 4 week interval responder 12 week interval non-responders duration study . Subjects receive diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis ( TdaP ) booster immunization 22 week visit . Titers measure 6 week immunization.The primary endpoint study 50 % reduction peripheral blood eosinophilia stable background therapy 12 week post-initiation study drug . Secondary endpoint include absolute eosinophil count , frequency severity adverse event , reduction sign symptom HES , tissue eosinophilia , number eosinophils , mast cell precursor bone marrow , level marker eosinophil mast cell activation , eosinophil count background HES therapy 1 year , pharmacokinetics anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) level . Exploratory endpoint address predictor response benralizumab impact eosinophil depletion vaccine response glucose homeostasis . Subjects complete study benralizumab provide sustained clinical benefit , may eligible receive drug open-label extension protocol regulatory approval commercial availability market drug prescribe physician ( indication ) , development benralizumab discontinue MedImmune .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject eligible participation study follow criterion apply : 1 . Male female subject great equal to18 less equal 65 year age screening . 2 . A female subject eligible study pregnant breastfeed one following : 1 . Of childbearing potential agrees practice effective contraception , determine PI , abstinence throughout study 3 month administration last dose investigational study drug 2 . Of nonchildbearing potential Females nonchildbearing potential defined female function ovary document history tubal ligation hysterectomy female postmenopausal , define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile , e.g . age appropriate , &gt; 45 year , absence hormone replacement therapy . In questionable case , blood sample follicle stimulate hormone estradiol obtain confirm childbearing potential . Acceptable method contraception may include one follow : 1 ) male partner sterile prior female subject entry study sole sexual partner female subject ; 2 ) implant levonorgestrel ; 3 ) injectable progestogen , 4 ) intrauterine device document failure rate &lt; 1 % ; 5 ) double barrier method include diaphragm condom spermicide . 3 ) A male subject eligible study one following : 1 . Surgically sterile 2 . Agrees practice effective contraception ( see ) abstinence throughout study 3 month last administration investigational study drug 4 ) Documented diagnosis HES ( history persistent eosinophilia &gt; 1500/ ( micro ) L without secondary cause evidence end organ manifestation attributable eosinophilia ) 5 ) Signs symptom HES AEC &gt; 1000/ ( micro ) L stable HES therapy great equal 1 month time enrollment 6 ) Participation protocol 94I0079 ( Activation function eosinophil condition blood tissue eosinophilia ) 7 ) Agrees storage sample study Participation Women : Contraception : The effect benralizumab develop human fetus unknown . For reason , men woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Females childbearingage must negative pregnancy test result prior receive benralizumab . During course study , woman become pregnant suspect pregnant , inform study staff primary care physician immediately . If subject becomes pregnant , investigational drug discontinue immediately , subject counsel resume approve therapeutic option consultation obstetric provider . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject exclude participation study follow criterion apply time enrollment : 1 . Subjects lifethreatening serious illness clinical manifestation HES deem inappropriate inclusion study per principal investigator , include restrict severe cardiac involvement prior thromboembolic disease . 2 . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know immunodeficiency 3 . Positive hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis C virus antibody serology , positive medical history hepatitis B C. Patients history hepatitis B vaccination without history hepatitis B allow enroll 4 . Presence FIP1L1/PDGFRA another know imatinibsensitive mutation 5 . Diagnosis systemic mastocytosis serum tryptase level &gt; 40 ng/mL 6 . Known lymphoma , hematological malignancy , advance metastatic solid tumor and/or subject chemotherapy , radiotherapy interleukin 2 treatment 7 . Known history allergic anaphylactic reaction previous antibody therapy , include intravenous immunoglobulin license experimental monoclonal antibody . 8 . A helminth parasitic infection diagnose within 24 week prior date informed consent obtain 9 . Acute bacterial viral infection ( subject may enrol acute infection resolve ) . 10 . Receipt intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) within 30 day prior date informed consent obtain 11 . Receipt market ( eg omalizumab ) investigational biologic within 4 month 5 halflives prior date inform consent obtain , whichever longer 12 . Receipt live attenuate vaccine 30 day prior date randomization 13 . Receipt inactive/killed vaccination ( e.g . inactive influenza ) allow provide administer within 1 week before/after study visit 14 . Receipt investigational nonbiologic within 30 day 5 halflives prior date inform consent obtain , whichever longer 15 . History alcohol drug abuse within 12 month prior date informed consent obtain 16 . Previous treatment benralizumab ( MEDI563 ) . Coenrollment Guidelines : Coenrollment trial restrict , enrollment observational study evaluate use licensed medication . Study staff notify coenrollment may require approval Investigator . Justification Exclusion Children : Because insufficient data regard dose adverse event available adult HES judge potential risk child , child exclude study .</criteria>
