	<brief_summary>This three-year project aim 1 . Profile differentially express metabolite healthy patient severe Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) six-month continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment 2 . Identify candidate metabolite involve biologic pathway attribute OSA phenotyping response CPAP treatment 3 . Validate candidate metabolite intermittent-hypoxia model peripheral monocyte</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea characterize chronic intermittent hypoxia sleep fragmentation . The sequel OSA include excessive daytime sleepiness , cardiovascular disease , neurocognitive dysfunction could reverse continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . A couple biologic pathway associate phenotyping OSA include craniofacial morphology , ventilator control , body fat distribution/metabolism , sleepiness vulnerability . Metabolomics , recently develop technique detect metabolomic profile , could help understand disease pathophysiology explore biomarkers . So far , one paper study metabolomic profile patient OSA putative identification 14 statistically significant feature profile . Our pilot study compare metabolic profile OSA patient randomly assign therapeutic subtherapeutic CPAP show CPAP treatment alter metabolomic profile . Seventeen metabolites three biologic pathways 13 metabolite six biologic pathway identify therapeutic subtherapeutic CPAP , respectively . Sixteen metabolites three biologic pathway identify compare two group . However , couple weakness study literature . Furthermore , direct causal relationship profile metabolite OSA need clarify . Therefore , plan compare metabolic profile control subject healthy OSA patient , six-month CPAP treatment , identify candidate metabolite involve biologic pathway attribute phenotyping response CPAP treatment . Furthermore , candidate metabolite involve biologic pathway , especially pathways ROS , inflammation , metabolism , validate intermittent hypoxia model peripheral monocyte .</detailed_description>
