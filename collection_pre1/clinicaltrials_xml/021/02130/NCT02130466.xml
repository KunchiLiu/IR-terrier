	<brief_summary>This 5-part dose-finding preliminary efficacy study pembrolizumab ( Pembro ) + dabrafenib ( D ) + trametinib ( T ) participant advance melanoma . Parts 1 2 open-label find confirm maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /maximum administer dose ( MAD ) Pembro+D+T . The primary hypothesis ( Parts 1 2 ) Pembro+D+T sufficiently well-tolerated permit clinical investigation . Part 3 double-blind study Pembro+D+T versus placebo+D+T . The primary study hypothesis ( Part 3 ) Pembro+D+T improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare placebo+D+T . Part 4 nonrandomized open-label design evaluate safety tolerability identify MTD MAD Pembro+T participant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [ BRAF ] mutation-negative ( without V600 E K ) melanoma solid tumor [ irrespective BRAF status ] . The primary hypothesis ( Part 4 ) Pembro+T sufficiently well-tolerated permit clinical investigation . Part 5 confirm dose ( ) identify Part 4 participant BRAF wild type [ without V600E K ] melanoma solid tumor [ irrespective BRAF status ] evaluate safety preliminary efficacy ( Objective Response Rate [ ORR ] ) Pembro+T participant BRAF wild type [ without V600E K ] melanoma . The primary hypothesis ( Part 5 ) Pembro+T sufficiently well-tolerated MTD/MAD permit clinical investigation effective attain objective response base upon Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 Investigator review participant melanoma without BRAF V600 E K mutation . Parts 1 2 study also explore MTD/MAD open-label Pembro+T ( BRAF mutation-negative participant ) concurrently Pembro+D+T arm ; Pembro+D ( BRAF mutation-positive participant ) .</brief_summary>
