	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness immunosuppressive medication , Belatacept , replacement calcineurin inhibitor , combination standard care regimen immunosuppressive medication plasma exchange ( plasmapheresis immunoglobulin treatment ) kidney transplant patient moderately sensitize deceased donor at-risk delayed graft function . The hypothesis moderately sensitized patient receive Belatacept treatment standard care regimen lead low acute rejection rate historical control base assessment standard care biopsies standard Banff criterion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belatacept Kidney Transplantation Moderately Sensitized Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory single-center , open-label safety efficacy study enroll 20 adult kidney transplant candidate , moderately sensitize decease donor at-risk delayed graft function ( DGF ) , receive Belatacept ( day 0,5 , week 2,4,8 12 ( 10 mg/kg ) , every 4 week thereafter ( 5 mg/kg ) ) , plasma exchange ( twice transplant ) Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) ( 100 mg/kg plasma exchange ) , along Thymoglobulin ( ATG ) induction Dexamethasone taper dose start day transplant 100mg IV , taper Day 4 , follow prednisone 30 mg Day 5 taper dose prednisone 10 mg/d one month , total observation period 1 year . Patients taper tacrolimus week 8 remain mycophenolic acid prednisone total length study . Subjects follow 1 year post transplant .</detailed_description>
