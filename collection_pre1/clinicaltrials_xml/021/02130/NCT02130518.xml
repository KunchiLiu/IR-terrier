	<brief_summary>Long-term indwelling urinary catheter associate chronic recurrent urinary tract infection blockage cause crystalline biofilm accumulation ( encrustation ) catheter surface . When urine catheter colonize urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis , encrustation catheter likely occur . The use catheter irrigation solution prevent biofilm formation encrustation lead blockage may keep catheter patent longer , result few catheter change , potentially low incidence UTIs well patient quality life . Auriclosene non-antibiotic , fast-acting , broad-spectrum antimicrobial , exhibit potential rapid decolonization range urologic pathogen , include urease-producing Proteus mirabilis . Subjects randomize either Auriclosene Irrigation Solution Auriclosene Vehicle solution .</brief_summary>
