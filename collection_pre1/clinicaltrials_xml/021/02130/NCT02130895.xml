	<brief_summary>This mixed method study seek assess understand impact use advanced CDS tool present STOPP criterion support prescribers point decision-making . We ask overarch question : **How clinical decision support tool effectively translate complex set evidence-based rule primary care clinical practice ? ** The work divide 2 phase . PHASE 1 : Randomized control trial . We measure change potentially inappropriate prescribing primary care prescribers ( e.g . family doctor ) use Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) tool Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) , compare . Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing define STOPP criterion , criterion use clinical decision support tool EMR . We use OSCAR EMR study . EMR base query develop assess number potentially inappropriate prescription current 12 physician practice baseline 16 week . PHASE 2 : We complete qualitative follow participant aid understanding primary care prescribers perceive CDS . This help explain Phase 1 finding provide additional information enhance future decision support tool .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing CDS OSCAR EMR Using STOPP Criteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The STOPP ( Screening Tool Older People 's potentially inappropriate Prescriptions ) criteria previously clinically validate set suggest medication avoid patient age 65+ certain characteristic ( e.g . benzodiazepine avoid fall history ) . These previously translate point care reminder use OSCAR Electronic Medical Record ( EMR ) physicians notify potentially inappropriate prescription patient 's chart open . This two phase explanatory study examine STOPP base point care prescribe alert present physician OSCAR EMR change potentially inappropriate prescribing pattern primary care physician . PHASE 1 : A cluster randomize control trial private primary care physician office . The intervention level physician consist activate set STOPP base alert physician see workflow . These alert trigger displayed physician point care . The alert suggest physician consider Potentially Inappropriate Prescriptions ( PIPs ) , define STOPP . The control group alert present . ( STOPP criterion describe full proposal , attach ) . The primary outcome measure composite indicator : - Î” Number PIPs patient &gt; 64yo visit intervention Number patient &gt; 64yo visit intervention Phase 1 Data Analysis : The outcome measure use University British Columbia ( UBC ) Department Family Practice 's research network infrastructure . The network design successfully test previous study ( UBC ETHICS H13-02531 ) . This network connect OSCAR EMRs , permission physician , able answer practice level question WITHOUT collect patient level data . The practice level query potentially inappropriate prescription distribute practice network aggregate answer ( patient level data ) return analysis . For example , one STOPP recommendation use non-cardioselective beta blocker patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The research network would able query physician practice intervention receive count back number patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) also non-cardioselective beta-blocker . PHASE 2 : Will seek qualitatively explain finding phase 1 physician participant . This consist one two , two-hour , semi-structured discussion group ( ) family physicians intervention group . The discussion group seek understand specific issue Phase 1 tool . The discussion group move follow step : ( ) consent ; ( b ) participant provide overall impression tool ; ( c ) review preliminary result Phase 1 ; ( ) specific feedback improve tool . The focus group audio record qualitatively analyze lens pragmatic content analysis well understand perception Clinical Decision Support ( CDS ) tool integration workflow . There may 2 discussion group allow broad participation schedule issue may remote discussion group , depend location physician participant .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Have use OSCAR EMR v 12.x &gt; 12 month ( provide enough time medication consistently document EMR ) . Have OSCAR EMR instal locally practice . Agree already part University British Columbia 's Department Family Practice 's ( UBC DFP ) research network . Ensure OSCAR Service Provider ( OSP ) agree support research network hardware/software installation . Have use STOPP criterion OSCAR prior study . Nonprescribers . Those provide longitudinal care ( e.g . walkin clinic ) . Specialists midwife . Those regular patient age 64 ( e.g . maternity clinic ) . Those use OSCAR 12.1 document prescription EMR prescription module . Those ALREADY use STOPP rule OSCAR prior study .</criteria>
