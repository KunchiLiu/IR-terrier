	<brief_summary>Insufficient sleep common , affect 20-40 % adult , result sleep disorder , medical condition , work demand , stress/emotional distress , social/domestic responsibility . It produce significant social , financial health-related cost , increasingly become major public health concern population study worldwide find reduced sleep duration associate increased risk obesity , morbidity , mortality . It well establish sleep loss cause fatigue sleepiness , well error accident due adverse neurobehavioral effect alertness , mood , cognitive function . However , substantial , trait-like difference among people extent experience neurobehavioral deficit sleep deprive . Common genetic variation involve sleep-wake , circadian , cognitive regulation may underlie large inter-individual difference neurobehavioral vulnerability sleep deprivation , though remains unclear whether different type sleep deprivation involve phenotypic response genotypic contributor . This project first large-scale investigation marker differential cognitive vulnerability acute total sleep loss chronic partial sleep loss . It identify individual significant risk fatigue severe impairment sleep loss . A total 110 healthy adult undergo 13-day laboratory protocol thoroughly characterize cognitive , psychological physiological response two common form sleep loss -- acute total sleep deprivation ( 1 night sleep loss ) chronic partial sleep deprivation ( 5 night sleep limit 4 hr ) . The finding study represent critical first step toward tailor appropriate follow-up intervention sleep loss symptomatic relief find predictor at-risk individual avoid sleep loss whenever possible , and/or seek effective countermeasure . Whether markers neurobehavioral vulnerability sleep loss identify , result project help inform public policy pertain need adequate sleep countermeasure sleep loss , also understand management vulnerability excessive sleepiness due common sleep medical disorder .</brief_summary>
