	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial investigate addition haploidentical natural killer cell infusion autologous stem cell transplantation . This intervention evaluate child high-risk solid tumor autologous transplantation indicate . Natural killer cell haploidentical family member give high dose chemotherapy positively select autologous stem cell . In patient neuroblastoma , anti-GD2 antibody hu14.18K322A also give . The effect normal hematopoietic cell recovery evaluate survival child treat approach determine . The investigator expect enroll 36 participant . Haploidentical family member ( donor ) also recruit provide natural killer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Immunotherapy Including Haploidentical NK Cell Infusion Following CD133+ Positively-Selected Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells Children With High Risk Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : - To evaluate day +35 ANC engraftment autologous stem cell transplantation high risk pediatric malignancy stem cell selection immunotherapy . Secondary Objectives - To estimate incidence relapse , disease-free survival overall survival . - To characterize lymphocyte hematopoietic reconstitution patient . - To describe characteristic stem cell natural killer cell graft . - To estimate overall survival patient treat without stem cell manipulation NK cell infusion due therapy criterion</detailed_description>
