	<brief_summary>Introduction : Increased intracranial pressure ( ICP ) consider important intracranial mechanism cause secondary injury patient admit acute traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) intracranial haemorrhage ( ICB ) include subarachnoid haemorrhage ( SAH ) . Currently , ICP measure monitor use invasive technique . The two ICP measurement method available - intraventricular intraparenchymal - require neurosurgical procedure order implant catheter probe within brain . The invasiveness current method ICP measurement limit diagnose reliability many neurological condition intracranial hypertension treatable adverse event . A reliable , accurate precise non-invasive method measure ICP would considerable clinical value , enable ICP measurement without need surgical intervention . Aim : The aim study validate novel non-invasive ICP measurement device compare measurement `` gold standard '' invasive ICP-measurement intracranial probe . The device use study develop Telematic Science Laboratory Kaunas University Technology , Lithuania . Methods : The non-invasive ICP measurement method assess prospectively use repeatable simultaneous non-invasive invasive ( standard intracranial probe ) ICP measurements patient present TBI SAH . The device method base two-depth transcranial doppler ( TCD ) technique simultaneously measure flow velocity intracranial extracranial segment ophthalmic artery ( OA ) . The intracranial segment OA compress ICP extracranial segment OA compress pressure Pe externally apply device . Two-depth TCD device use accurate indicator balance point ( Pe = ICP ) measure parameter blood flow velocity waveform intracranial extracranial segment OA identical . The device ultrasound transmission parameter exist TCD device meet patient safety criterion .</brief_summary>
