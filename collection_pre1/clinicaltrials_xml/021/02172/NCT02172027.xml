	<brief_summary>Pleural effusion lung cancer patient one symptom metastatic disease inoperable treat . Identification cancer cell pleural effusion lung cancer patient cytological test serve initial diagnosis . These cell use prepare cell block stain test . In research despite clinical suspicion , cytological diagnosis negative , due specimen contain cell damage cell whilst specimen process . A new method identify rare cell fluid immunomagnetic separation . Using method , antigen bind proteins cell wall unique tumor cell . When fluid pass magnetic field , separation occur cell magnetic tag remainder cell . The separated cell stain culture . The currently approve method immunomagnetic detection approve clinical use patient breast cancer , cancer intestine prostate cancer . An Israeli Biotech company develop advanced technology allow identification large number cell without cause morphological damage cell . The purpose current study examine technique immunomagnetic separation pleural effusion lung cancer patient comparison cytological test . In future hop large number patient sample include characterization cell possible compare clinical cytological characteristic .</brief_summary>
