	<criteria>1 . Subjects : 1 . Subject normal renal function ( creatinine clearance 80 % predict creatinine clearance healthy volunteer ) , confirm normal physical examination include vital sign , ECG laboratory value Calculated creatinine clearance ( male ) ; = ( ( 140 age ( yr ) ) x ( Wt ( kg ) ) ) / ( 72 x predict serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) ) Calculated creatinine clearance ( female ) ; = ( ( 140 age ( yr ) ) x ( Wt ( kg ) ) ) / ( 85 x predict serum creatinine ( mg/dL ) ) 2 . Subject impaired renal function must age relate good health without clinically significant abnormality assess physical examination . Mildly impaired renal patient define creatinine clearance 40 80 % predict creatinine clearance ; moderately impaired renal patient define creatinine clearance 10 40 % predict creatinine clearance .
