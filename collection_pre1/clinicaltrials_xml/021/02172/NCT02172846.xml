	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose hypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy give together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer . Proton beam radiation therapy type radiation therapy use streams proton ( tiny particle positive charge ) kill tumor cell . Giving proton beam radiation therapy high dos few day ( hypofractionation ) may improve local control tumor . Giving hypofractionated proton beam radiation therapy chemotherapy may better treatment non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically cytologically proven diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer . 2 . Clinical AJCC stage IIIII ( AJCC , 7th ed . ) plan treated concurrent chemoradiotherapy . 1 . Recurrent nonsmall cell lung cancer allow , provide intent current treatment curative prior radiation thorax . 2 . Prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , target therapy permit long patient recover prior toxicity grade ≤ 1 3 . Appropriate stage protocol entry base upon follow minimum diagnostic workup : 1 . History/physical examination within 30 day prior registration ; 2 . FDGPET/CT scan staging within 60 day prior registration ; 3 . MRI scan contrast brain ( prefer ) CT scan brain contrast within 60 day prior registration . 4 . Zubrod Performance Status 02 within 30 day prior registration . 5 . Age ≥ 18 year . 6 . CBC/differential obtain within 30 day prior registration , adequate bone marrow function define follow : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3 ; 2 . Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 ; 3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl acceptable . ) ; 7 . AST ALT ≤ 1.5 upper limit normal within 30 day prior registration . 8 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 upper limit normal within 30 day prior registration . 9 . Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min within 30 day prior registration estimate CockcroftGault formula : Creatinine Clearance ( male ) = [ ( 140 age ) x ( wt kg ) ] [ ( Serum Creatinine mg/dl ) x ( 72 ) ] Creatinine Clearance ( female ) = 0.85 x Creatinine Clearance ( male ) 10 . Peripheral neuropathy ≤ grade 1 time registration . 11 . Presence measurable evaluable disease . 12 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test within 2 week prior registration woman childbearing potential . 13 . Women childbearing potential male participant must agree use medically effective mean birth control throughout participation treatment phase study . 14 . Able understand willing sign IRBapproved inform consent document . 1 . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : 1 . Unstable angina , history myocardial infarction and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month ; 2 . Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; 3 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration ; 4 . Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol ; 5 . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Protocolspecific requirement may also exclude immunocompromised patient . 2 . Prior radiotherapy thorax . 3 . Currently receive investigational agent . 4 . Pregnant breastfeeding . 5 . Presence cardiac pacemaker ( due risk create proton magnet ) .
