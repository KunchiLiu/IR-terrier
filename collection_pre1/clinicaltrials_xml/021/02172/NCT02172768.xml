	<brief_summary>The primary objective trial follow : To determine pharmacokinetics micafungin give twice weekly patient risk develop invasive fungal disease ( patient treat acute chronic graft versus host disease ; patient receive reduced intensity condition Stem Cell Transplant ( SCT ) ; receive first remission induction chemotherapy Acute Myeloid Leucaemia ( AML ) /MyeloDysplasticSyndrome ( MDS ) ) compare pharmacokinetics micafungin give daily . The secondary objective trial follow : To determine whether adequate exposure micafungin attain . To determine safety micafungin patient population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Micafungin Given Twice Weekly Intravenously Compared Micafungin Given Daily Patients Risk Developing Invasive Fungal Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Micafungin show reasonable option treat invasive aspergillosis hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) recipient proven effective fluconazole prophylaxis . Whilst micafungin much offer , little know pharmacokinetic profile specific patient population , specifically concern alternate dosing strategy increase dosage prolong dose interval . Sufficient data lacking twice weekly administration micafungin antifungal prophylaxis . Decreasing dose frequency twice weekly seem reasonable approach consider long terminal elimination life ( i.e . 10-17 h ) consider data available murine model support use less frequent dose high dosage . It enable u characterize pharmacokinetics micafungin hematology cohort directly compare exposure alternate dose strategy .</detailed_description>
