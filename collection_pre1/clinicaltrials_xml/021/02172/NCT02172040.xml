	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect celecoxib efficacy safety amlodipine besylate subject hypertension require antihypertensive therapy . This study conduct support future marketing application KIT-302 , oral fix combination drug product ( FCDP ) consist antihypertensive drug amlodipine besylate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) celecoxib . KIT-302 develop `` convenience reformulation '' FCDP facilitate improve patient compliance day administration individual component , amlodipine celecoxib , use together treatment hypertension patient also require use NSAID relief sign symptom osteoarthritis . Although final KIT-302 formulation single capsule , study , two separate capsule utilize : one contain commercial celecoxib capsule ( Celebrex® ) match placebo capsule one contain commercial amlodipine besylate tablet ( Norvasc® ) match placebo tablet . The study hypothesis treatment amlodipine besylate containing capsule plus celecoxib containing capsule reduce blood pressure ( BP ) subject hypertension efficacy substantially inferior effect amlodipine besylate alone ( i.e. , amlodipine containing capsule plus matched placebo celecoxib capsule ) .</brief_summary>
