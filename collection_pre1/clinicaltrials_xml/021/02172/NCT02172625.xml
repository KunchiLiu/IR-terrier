	<brief_summary>Nutrition supplementation antioxidant discuss way enhance overall well-being athlete , promote faster recovery , improve overall performance . The use Protandim , nutritional supplement contain 5 botanical ( Bacopa extract 150 mg ; milk thistle 225mg ; ashwagandha 150 mg ; green tea 75 mg ; turmeric 75 mg ) show promise earlier study reduce oxidative stress increase amount anti-oxidant enzymes blood . The purpose study examine effect ~90 day Protandim supplementation 5-km run performance acute long term oxidative damage assess blood marker . Secondarily , another purpose study examine effect Protandim supplementation blood parameter ( antioxidant enzyme concentration ) measure quality life . The experiment double-blind , placebo control . The study address two main question two secondary question : Main Question 1 : Does regular supplementation Protandim ( 675 mg/day 90 day ) improve 5-km run time ? Hypothesis : Protandim would improve 5-km running time 0.5 min ( SD 1-min ) . This equivalent effect size 0.5 . The placebo group change performance . Main Question 2 : Does regular supplementation Protandim ( 675 mg/day 90 day ) reduce oxidative damage rest assess lipid peroxide ( TBARS ) runner ? Hypothesis : Based data Nelson et al . ( 2006 ) , oxidative damage would reduce 40 % ( effect size = 4.8 ) . Secondary Question 1 : Does regular supplementation Protandim ( 675 mg/day 90 day ) runner reduce increase oxidative damage post-race compare pre-race assess lipid peroxide ( TBARS ) ? Hypothesis : Based data Kyparos et al . ( 2009 ) , expect 45 % increase TBARS post-exercise compare pre-exercise ( effect size 3.6 ) . However , expect Protandim 90 day 31 % increase TBARS post-race ( effect size = 2.5 ) [ base change pre-post lipid peroxide Arent et al . ( 2010 ) ] . Secondary Question 2 : Does regular supplementation Protandim ( 675 mg/day 90 day ) improve quality life accord WHOQOL-BREF ( Skevington , Lotfy , O'Connell , &amp; Group , 2004 ) ? Hypothesis : There would statistical improvement quality life post-Protandim supplementation small effect size improvement 0.33 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Protandim Supplementation Oxidative Damage Athletic Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty apparently healthy community runner 18-55 yrs age recruit participate study require six total visit University Louisville , include three session run track University Louisville . A 120 mL blood withdrawn peripheral vein duration study ( 105 day ) . Runners recruit run club across local community . These participant randomize two group ( Protandim , Placebo ) . The group sex performance match initial 5-km race . Each subject underwent six test session . Session 1 ( Initial Screening Day ) Subjects sign consent form complete questionnaire clear physical activity . Age , weight , height record . Subjects ask list nutritional supplement take , include multivitamin . They ask list 5-km personal best time , do . They report recent 5-km time achieve . Then ask refrain taking multivitamins nutritional supplement duration study . The subject record ate 24 hr prior test day , ask eat thing activity follow test . Then train diary give fill duration study . The training diary include intensity , train duration , mileage per week . After , give six quality life questionnaire [ World Health Organization 's WHOQOL-BREF quality life assessment fill home ( one Session 1-6 ) ] . A pregnancy test also conduct female . Session 2 ( Baseline , About 15 day Session 1 ) Subjects fast morning arrive University Louisville pre-exercise blood sample . They bring 24-hr dietary recall quality life form . Approximately three teaspoon blood withdrawn 30-60 minute prior exercise analysis several blood parameter . Then subject require partake 5-km time trial University Louisville track . The runner race together group 6 10 runner per race accord estimate 5-km time . The estimate 5-km time best estimate . Time trial great logical validity compare time-to-exhaustion test time-trials select performance measure . About 10-20 minute post-exercise , another three teaspoon blood withdrawn subject . Only post-exercise blood draw subject able eat . Based performance 5-km time trial , male female rank separately . This do randomized block two male , randomize block two female . For example , male rank 5-km race fast runner slow runner . First second place male place block two . Third fourth place male place block two . And . Then fair coin flip . If head , first rank runner first pair go Group 1 , otherwise , second rank runner pair go Group 1 . This do block two male ( pair two male ) . The performed woman . This randomization allow mean 5-km run time group well maintain similar male female ratio . Session 3 ( About 7 day Session 2 ) Subjects fast morning arrive University Louisville pre-exercise blood sample . They bring 24-hr dietary recall quality life form . Approximately three teaspoon blood withdrawn 30-60 minute prior exercise analysis several blood parameter ( analytes list Table 3 ) . Then subject partake 5-km time trial University Louisville track . About 30-minutes post-exercise , another three teaspoon blood withdrawn subject . Only post-exercise blood draw subject able eat . Depending group , give approximately 100 day supply Protandim Placebo ( corn starch food color ) . The study double blind neither researcher subject knew group Protandim group group Placebo group . They ingest 1 pill per day , ideally breakfast ( 675 mg per day , 1 pill per day ) . The subject give complete supply pill session , right second blood sample take . The subject classify Group 1 Group 2 base five kilometer result first session . The pill bottle label Group 1 Group 2 . The pill bottle dispense research team accord group number second blood sample . Subjects asked record daily intake pill train diary . Once study complete , subject ask return pill bottle research staff . That way , researcher able account miss day . Session 4 ( About 23 Days Session 3 ) Subjects fast morning arrive University Louisville pre-exercise blood sample . They bring 24-hr dietary recall quality life form . Approximately three teaspoon blood withdrawn . There 5-km running race perform session . A pregnancy test perform female . Session 5 ( 30 Days Session 4 ) Subjects fast morning arrive University Louisville pre-exercise blood sample . They bring 24-hr dietary recall quality life form . Approximately three teaspoon blood withdrawn . There run race perform session . A pregnancy test conduct female . Session 6 ( About 30 day Session 5 ) Subjects fast morning arrive University Louisville pre-exercise blood sample . They bring 24-hr dietary recall quality life form . They also bring unused pill proper documentation . A pregnancy test conduct female . Then , approximately three teaspoon blood withdrawn 30-60 minute prior exercise analysis several blood parameter . Then subject partake 5-km time trial University Louisville track . About 30-minutes post-exercise , another three teaspoon blood withdrawn subject . Only post-exercise blood draw subject able eat . Things Consider : The subject-variability oxidative stress biomarkers large ( Mullins et al . 2013 ) suggest may responders non-responders oxidative stress challenge ( Mullins et al . 2013 ) . Individuals large increase oxidative stress ( i.e . responder ) could reflect inability regulate redox homeostasis warrant additional support ( i.e . antioxidant supplementation Protandim ) . It also necessary obtain week-to week month month coefficient variation marker oxidative stress meaningful change marker evaluate . Thus , placebo group allow u obtain week-to-week month month coefficient variation . As well , reason , necessary obtain week-to-week month month variation run performance , thus , placebo group allow development coefficient variation performance . Measuring dietary data troublesome . First , questionnaires n't give detail antioxidant intake - rather give outcome like fruit veg intake , etc . More depth measure would n't worth trouble . Thus , subject record eat ( physical activity ) 24 hr prior test day , ask eat thing activity follow test seven day 90 day require . Environmental condition record day three time trial ( wind , temperature , % humidity , barometric pressure ) . Statistical Analyses Once data collect analyzed , LifeVantage reveal group . The main dependent variable measure 5-km finishing time , TBARS , SOD , quality life questionnaire . Based 5-km time improvement 2.5 % 30 second ( SD = 1 minute ) Protandim , improvement placebo group , 32 runner total would need ( Effect size = 0.5 , statistical power = 80 % , alpha error probability = 5 % , Correlation amongst repeat measure = 0.90 , F-test Family , ANOVA repeat measure , factor , G*Power 3.1.2 , Universität Kiel , Germany ) . Accounting 20 % attrition rate ( 8 subject ) , total 40 subject recruit ( 20 per group ) . Possible Risks Ingesting Protandim : We expect side effect typical Protandim consumer . However , accord Protandim website ( http : //www.protandim.com/faqs ) , individual natural allergic response one ingredient , people allergic pine pollen penicillin . These allergic response Protandim generally appear gastrointestinal disturbance ( i.e. , stomach ache , diarrhea , vomit ) sometimes headache rash hand foot . The symptom disappear Protandim discontinue . However , accord Natural Standard Database ( http : //naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/ ) , botanical show rare side effect . They list .</detailed_description>
