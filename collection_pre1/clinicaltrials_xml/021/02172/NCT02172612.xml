	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Reduce Inappropriate Anticholinergic Prescribing Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening : Patients see Sanders-Brown clinic part ADC cohort screen eligibility study ADC study coordinator license prescriber involve schedule ADC visit . Enrollment : If patient consider eligible base screening , study coordinator introduce study potential participant answer question patient might . If patient interested , study coordinator obtain informed consent proceed study related activity . Medication information SF-36 collect part ADC cohort data collection ; therefore , reduce burden participant , plan work ADC team use data baseline information study . For participant randomize intervention group , two onsite study visit scheduled- intervention visit plan within week enrollment end study visit schedule 8 week enrollment . Participants randomize control group end study visit schedule 8 week post-enrollment . After enrollment , study pharmacist perform medication therapy management ( MTM ) review medication list provide patient . The pharmacist identify anticholinergic medication , determine medication appropriateness index prepare report include information potential inappropriate medication make recommendation treatment discontinuation change consider appropriate . For participant include intervention group , pharmacist discus recommendation one license prescribers schedule visit participant .

Post-visit evaluation : The study pharmacist review new medication list follow-up MAI calculate similar procedure detail . Post-visit follow-up : All study participant receive thank letter inform availability study team discuss medication plan ADC prescribers continue support ongoing care . The thank letter also include check compensate participant part study . Intervention The intervention base pharmacist-physician team drug review . For patient randomize intervention group , clinical pharmacist perform drug review guide revise medication plan discuss patient . Specifically , propose plan attempt recommend discontinuation replacement inappropriate drug anticholinergic property , safer drug alternative ( i.e. , less anticholinergic activity ) . When drug alternative unavailable , reduction dosage attempt reduce anticholinergic burden . As part routine clinical duty care ADC research participant , prescribe team ( ADC license practitioner ) make recommendation patient , study pharmacist responsible recommendation provision information educate patient medication safety importance patient involvement medication awareness oversight . Appropriate change determine carry licensed prescriber letter send inform primary care physician medication change rationale change .</detailed_description>
