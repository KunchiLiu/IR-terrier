Attempting ascertain influence collective schema neural substrate individual memory use cutting-edge brain image method represent challenge MULTIBRAIN seek tackle . To achieve goal , record brain activity group 24 participant remember picture tour World War II Memorial Caen . This study seek identify brain area prefrontal cortex encode organization knowledge collective memory use multivariate analysis brain pattern activation , understand region might modulate recruitment hippocampus episodic memory retrieval use analysis effective connectivity . The organization knowledge collective memory measure parallel 1 ) analysis French social memory World War II use corpus 100 000 television radio show National Institute Audiovisual , 2 ) internet task measure organization individual knowledge large group individual allow separate share non-shared memory World War II . Once collect , data help u understand collective schema may reconfigure organization individual memory .</brief_summary>
