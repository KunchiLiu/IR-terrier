	<brief_summary>The investigator evaluate outcome allogeneic stem cell transplantation curative treatment modality patient chronic myeloid leukemia fail tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy . However , update report transplant outcome patient fail TKI therapy , thus necessitate update data . Also , European Group Blood Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) risk score still value , insufficient number patient transplanted recent year TKI therapy allow robust reanalysis . Our study hypothesis allogeneic SCT treatment modality rescue CML patient fail TKI therapy due resistance intolerance improve survival long-term outcome . Also , another hypothesis examine EBMT risk score propose pre-imatinib era reproduce similar prognostic risk stratification long-term outcome patient treat TKI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic SCT CML , TKI Failure After TKI Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) remain currently available treatment render patient durably molecularly negative , associate procedural-related morbidity mortality remain major deterrent . Currently follow accept reasonable indication allogeneic SCT CML : failure 2nd generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( 2GTKI ) imatinib failure , 2GTKI frontline failure , patient meet criteria failure development additional cytogenetic abnormality ( ACA ) , clonal evolution ph neg clone , development mutation loss CCyR well advance disease stage include accelerate blastic phase . However , insufficient number patient transplanted recent year TKI therapy , thus necessitate update data . The EBMT risk score use decade decision make transplantation pre-imatinib era . However , never re-evaluated large cohort CML patient treat TKIs prior SCT receive alloSCT , thus require reanalysed prognostic implication long-term survival . As mentioned , update report transplant outcome patient fail TKI therapy , thus necessitate update data . Also , EBMT risk score2 still value , insufficient number patient transplanted recent year TKI therapy allow robust reanalysis . This retrospective study . The medical record review retrospectively . The treatment outcomes complete cytogenetic response ( CCyR ) , major molecular response ( MMR ) , molecular response 4.5 log reduction ( MR4.5 ) , treatment failure ( TF ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) estimate use Kaplan-Meier method . The CCR define 0 % Ph+ metaphase cell marrow less 1 % international scale use BCR-ABL1 transcript polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test . The MMR define low equal 0.1 % IS BCR-ABL1 fusion gene transcript , MR4.5 define 0.0032 % IS BCR-ABL1 transcript level , equivalent 4.5 log reduction BCR-ABL1 transcript level . Time treatment failure ( TTF ) define interval allogeneic SCT occurrence event indicate CML relapse include primary hematologic resistance , cytogenetic resistance , loss CCyR , development ABL tyrosine kinase domain mutation , clonal evolution progression accelerate phase ( AP ) blastic crisis ( BC ) . Death consider censored TTF . Time PFS define interval transplantation confirmation progression AP BC death cause , OS calculate transplantation date death cause late follow-up . Pre-transplant characteristic transplant procedure data also collect include age , disease stage , diagnosis/transplant date , donor type gender match . Summary treatment outcome follow previous TKI therapy also collect . Post-transplant event graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) progression CML also collect . No study intervention . Assessment Efficacy : Cytogenetic response categorize complete ( 0 % Ph+ cell marrow conventional cytogenetics ) , partial ( 1 % 34 % Ph+ cell marrow ) , minor ( 35 % 90 % Ph+ cell marrow ) . A major cytogenetic response ( MCyR ) define sum CCyR partial cytogenetic response ( i.e . 0 % - 35 % Ph+ cell marrow ) . Major molecular response ( MMR ) define low equal 0.1 % IS BCR-ABL1 fusion gene transcript , molecular response 4.5 ( MR4.5 ) define 0.0032 % IS BCR-ABL1 transcript level , equivalent 4.5 log reduction BCR-ABL1 transcript level . Time treatment failure ( TTF ) define interval allogeneic SCT occurrence event indicate CML relapse include primary hematologic resistance , cytogenetic resistance , loss CCyR , development ABL tyrosine kinase domain mutation , clonal evolution progression accelerate phase ( AP ) blastic crisis ( BC ) . Death consider censored TTF . Time PFS define interval transplantation confirmation progression AP BC death cause , OS calculate transplantation date death cause late follow-up . Statistical analysis : The list CML patient utilized retrospective study . Study ID , gender , disease characteristic time diagnosis , detail treatment , detailed response treatment , resistance intolerance long-term outcome retrospectively review . Study endpoints analyzed respect complete cytogenetic response ( CCR ) , major/complete molecular response ( MMR/CMR ) , loss response , resistance , progression advance disease death . The cumulative incidence CCR , MMR CMR estimate compare use approach propose Gray ( Gray , 1988 ) . Overall survival analyze use Kaplan-Meier method compare use log-rank test . Loss response , resistance failure-free survival analyze use test cumulative incidence account compete risk event . Baseline characteristic , include Sokal score , age , gender , disease stage , adopt surrogate response , progression free overall survival follow transplantation . For EBMT risk score , age patient , stage disease transplant , time diagnosis ( &lt; 12 month vs &gt; 12months ) , donor type , donor recipient gender combination use calculation . The transplant outcome compare accord EBMT risk score . P-values le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Hazard ratio ( HR ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) estimate predetermined reference risk 1.0 . The EZR software use statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
