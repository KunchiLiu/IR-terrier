	<detailed_description>The participant give study drug-dosing diary keep track take study drug . The participant take study drug every day , 14 - 28 day , prior surgery . - Run-In Phase : The first 6-12 participant receive high-dose vitamin D prior surgery . The number participant phase base result analyze research sample . - Randomized Phase : Because one know study option best , participant `` randomize '' one study group : high dose vitamin D standard dose vitamin D. - 48 Participants randomized receive high-dose vitamin D standard-dose vitamin D. Randomization mean participant put group chance . Neither participant research doctor choose group participant . The participant equal chance get assign arm ( like flip coin ) . The randomized phase enroll two group time : - Group A : 24 participant recent diagnosis stage I , II III colon cancer randomize receive high-dose vitamin D standard-dose vitamin D. - Group B : 24 participant resectable liver metastasis colon cancer randomize receive high-dose vitamin D standard-dose vitamin D. Additional research procedure perform study : - Blood sample collect research purpose ( little 2 teaspoon blood ) . The sample collect immediately prior participant 's surgery use study vitamin D receptor pathway , well relationship colon cancer . Some blood store used future cancer research . - Tumor tissue collect research purpose time participant surgery . This tissue also use study vitamin D receptor pathway , well relationship colon cancer . Some tumor tissue collect send use separate , related study . In study , participant 's tumor use grow cell line . This mean participant 's tumor cell multiply lab . These cell line use study bind site gene participant learn vitamin D 's role preventing colon cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma colon localize , evidence distant metastasis ( stage I , II , III ) , surgical resection primary tumor plan ; OR Participants must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma colon resectable liver metastasis liver resection plan . No prior radiation therapy systemic treatment allow patient undergo resection stage I , II , III colon cancer . Prior systemic treatment radiation therapy allow patient resectable liver metastasis . The last dose chemotherapy radiation must administer least 4 week prior liver surgery . The last dose bevacizumab must administer least 6 week prior liver resection . Age ≥18 year . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 ( see Appendix A ) Participants must normal organ marrow function define : Total bilirubin ≤1.5× institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN , &lt; 5x ULN clearly attributable liver metastasis Serum calcium ( correct albumin level ) ≤ 1x institutional ULN Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subject creatinine level institutional normal . Participants fulldose anticoagulation eligible follow criterion meet : Participant inrange INR ( usually 23 ) stable dose warfarin stable dose low molecular weight heparin Participant active bleed pathological condition carry high risk bleeding ( i.e. , tumor involve major vessel know varix ) Participants receive antiplatelet agent eligible . In addition , patient daily prophylactic aspirin anticoagulation atrial fibrillation eligible . Discontinuation anticoagulation , aspirin , and/or antiplatelet agent prior surgery occur accord institutional standard care . Nonpregnant nursing Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 14 day prior study entry . Women childbearing potential include female experienced menarche undergone surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive month ; woman hormone replacement therapy document serum follicle stimulate hormone level &gt; 35 mIU/mL ) . Women use oral , implanted , injectable contraceptive hormone mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) , consider childbearing potential . The effect higherdose vitamin D3 colon liver surgery ( associate perioperative medication anesthesia ) develop human fetus unknown may pose unacceptable risk . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Prior systemic therapy , radiotherapy , investigational agent participant undergo surgery stage I , II , III colon cancer . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week bevacizumab ) liver resection . Concurrent use anticancer therapy , include chemotherapy agent , target agent , biological agent , immunotherapy , investigational agent otherwise specify protocol . Inability swallow pill . History malabsorption uncontrolled vomit diarrhea , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function could interfere absorption oral medication . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vitamin D. Regular use supplemental vitamin D total ≥ 2,000 IU/day past year . Use supplemental vitamin D supplement contain vitamin D beyond protocolprescribed study treatment allow treatment period clinical trial . In order maintain blinding , vitamin D level routinely check screen study treat investigator . Vitamin D level assay part research blood sample collect study . If concern relate participant 's vitamin D status , lead Principal Investigator contact discussion . Use chronic oral corticosteroid therapy , lithium , phenytoin , quinidine , isoniazid , and/or rifampin ( cause vitamin D depletion ) . Shortterm use corticosteroid antiemetic therapy chemotherapy permit . Regular use thiazide diuretic ( i.e. , hydrochlorothiazide ) , lead hypercalcemia , unwillingness inability discontinue switch alternative antihypertensive agent . Preexisting hypercalcemia ( defined baseline serum calcium institutional ULN , correct albumin level albumin within institutional limit normal ) . The use supplemental calcium supplement contain calcium prohibit treatment period clinical trial . Known active hyperparathyroid disease serious disturbance calcium metabolism past 5 year . History symptomatic genitourinary stone within past year . Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study treatment , limit compliance study requirement , interfere interpretation study result . Pregnant nursing woman men/women childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception . Pregnant nursing woman exclude study unknown potential risk adverse event relate higherdose vitamin D3 colon liver surgery ( associate perioperative medication anesthesia ) human fetus . Consequently , breastfeed discontinue mother enrol study . History prior synchronous malignancy except : A malignancy treat curative intent , know active disease &gt; 3 year prior randomization , risk recurrence low determine investigator . Curatively treated nonmelanoma skin malignancy , cervical cancer situ , prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence prostate cancer . Known positive test human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus , acute chronic hepatitis B infection . Participants infection ineligible increase risk significant complication perioperative period , particularly active hepatitis B C patient undergo liver resection . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
