	<brief_summary>Over past decade , good number study regard coagulopathy increase bleeding tendency define macro- microscopic hemorrhage , declination hemoglobin level , thrombocytopenia , hypoprothrombinemia potentially cause use antibiotic variety suggest mechanism , include myelosuppression , immune-mediated destruction thrombocytes coagulation factor , suppression vitamin K epoxide reductase vitamin K-dependent Î³-glutamate carboxylase may lead inhibition biosynthesis coagulation factor II , VII , IX , X , report publish . Nevertheless , many case-series study case report low level evidence , large-scale retrospective cohort study regard antibiotic-associated coagulopathy publish . Moreover , addition exposure antibiotic , several risk factor , include severity illness , hepatic renal function , nutrition status , comorbidities cancer hematologic disease , surgery invasive procedure , concomitant use anticoagulant , NSAIDs , salicylates , age , may exert influence function coagulation system well . Therefore , study aim clarify association use antibiotic increase bleeding tendency development bleed event identify possible risk factor increase bleed tendency development bleed event patient receive antibiotic treatment application nest case-control design usage National Health Insurance Research Database ( NHIRD ) medical record National Taiwan University Hospital time period January , 1995 December , 2013 .</brief_summary>
