	<criteria>Male female patient ( pediatric ≤11 year ; adolescent / adult ≥12 year ) Documented diagnosis CF ( positive sweat chloride ≥60 mEq/liter , pilocarpine iontophoresis ) and/or genotype two identifiable mutation consistent CF accompany one clinical feature CF phenotype Able perform acceptable spirometric maneuver , accord ATS ( American Thoracic Society ) standard FEV1 &gt; 25 % predicted value Patients must able inhale medication reproducible manner Respimat® inhaler meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) Clinical stability : evidence acute upper low respiratory tract infection within 4 week screen pulmonary exacerbation require use i.v./oral/inhaled antibiotic , oral corticosteroid within 4 week screen FEV1 Visit 2 must within 10 % FEV1 Visit 1 . If FEV1 Visit 2 within 10 % FEV1 Visit 1 , Visit 2 may reschedule within 7 day The patient patient 's legally acceptable representative must able give informed consent accordance International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline local regulation Patients take chronic medication must willing continue therapy entire duration study Patients significant history allergy / hypersensitivity ( include medication allergy ) deem relevant trial judge Investigator . `` Relevance '' context refers increase risk hypersensitivity reaction trial medication Patients know hypersensitivity study drug component Patients participate another study Investigational drug within one month six halflives ( whichever great ) precede screen visit Patients currently participate another trial . Observational study allow . Permission obtain sponsor study Patients know relevant substance abuse , include alcohol drug abuse . The intention criterion exclude patient consider risk comply abuse trial medication administration directive . Female patient pregnant lactating , include female positive urine pregnancy test screening ( pregnancy test perform female child bear potential ) Female patient child bear potential use medically approve form contraception . Patients document persistent colonization B. cepacia ( define one positive culture within past year ) . The intention exclusion criterion consistent current policy within CF community reduce risk B. cepacia cross infection . Patients start new chronic medication CF within four ( 4 ) week screen . Patients cycle TOBI® ( Tobramycin treatment ) regimen must complete least three ( 3 ) cycle every month TOBI® administration prior screen visit . As cycle use TOBI® , clinical monitor consult patient enrol . Clinically significant disease medical condition CF CFrelated condition , opinion Investigator , would compromise safety patient quality data . This include significant hematological , hepatic , renal , cardiovascular , neurologic disease . Patients diabetes could participate disease good control prior screen . This criterion provide opportunity investigator exclude patient base clinical judgment , even eligibility criterion satisfy .</criteria>
