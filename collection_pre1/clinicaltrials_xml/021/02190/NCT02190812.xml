	<brief_title>An Intelligent Evaluation Wrist Strength Elderly People Its Clinical Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The muscle strength involve wrist muscle may gradually reduce age , impair operate skill even life quality elderly . This study propose evaluation system wrist muscle strength grip twist . This system consist torque meter ( FUTEK TDF400 ) three plugs/sockets simulation common grip twist daily living . This study complete evaluate wrist muscle strength men woman . In addition effect age gender , study analyzes influence apply force plug/socket diameter wrist muscle strength . Simultaneously , study measure effect proper forearm supporter alleviate pain improve wrist grip strength subject tennis elbow . And quantitative surface EMG use analyze relationship different forearm muscle involve . In order achieve user-friendly effect , system intergraded Cloud service Bluetooth technology , develop portable intelligent evaluation system wrist muscle strength . It help medical personnel assess analysis real-time data . The traditional training wrist muscle use grip grasp soft tennis ball . In study portable grip ball training system develop . It consist pressure sensor LabVIEW program . It 's expect reduce risk injury elderly daily life .</detailed_description>
