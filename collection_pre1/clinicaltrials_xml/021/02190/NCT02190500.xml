	<brief_summary>The primary goal project carry trial compare pre-hospital diagnosis treatment patient stroke symptom use Mobile Stroke Unit ( MSU ) subsequent transfer Comprehensive Stroke Center ( CSC ) Emergency Department ( ED ) management , standard pre-hospital triage transport Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) CSC ED evaluation treatment ( Standard Management-SM ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There many way use MSU might prove valuable stroke patient , focus acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) treatment IV tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) within 4.5 hour symptom onset since evidence base effective emergency treatment prevalent stroke diagnosis . We hypothesize MSU pathway result overall shift towards earlier evaluation treatment , particularly first hour symptom onset , lead substantially good outcome . We also hypothesize result improved clinical outcome result earlier treatment , cost MSU program offset reduction cost long term stroke care increase quality adjust life year , thereby support widespread use technology . To make MSU deployment practical , confirm Vascular Neurologist ( VN ) board MSU replace remote VN connect MSU telemedicine ( TM ) thereby reduce manpower requirement cost . The successful completion project provide data important outcome cost associate use MSU v SM United States ( U.S. ) help determine value integrate MSUs pre-hospital environment country . Successfully address three Specific Aims ( time saved/ complication encounter , utility TM , cost effectiveness ) provide critical information need determine subsequent definitive study conduct . We anticipate emanate exploratory study would large multicenter trial carried urban rural U.S. pre-hospital environment , treatment orchestrate via TM , sufficient power determine difference long term outcome cost patient manage two pathway , follow study design test exploratory trial . The present study , therefore , necessary first step process may dramatically modify way acute stroke patient manage U.S .</detailed_description>
