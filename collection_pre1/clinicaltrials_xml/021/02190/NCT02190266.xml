	<brief_summary>Background : - Coccidioidomycosis cause fungus grows southwest United States part Mexico South America . This disease cause breathe dust contain fungus . It lead serious lung breathing problem . Rarely , fungus infect body part . This call disseminated coccidioidomycosis ( DCM ) . If fungus stay lungs 6 month , call refractory coccidioidomycosis ( RCM ) . People DCM RCM may difficulty fight infection immune system problem . Researchers want study immune system people DCM RCM , learn disease best way treat . They also want learn type people get DCM RCM fungus cause . Objectives : - To learn DCM RCM , fungus cause disease , people get . Eligibility : - People age 2 DCM RCM . Design : - Participants screen review medical record . - At initial visit , participant : - Medical history physical exam - Blood urine test . Some blood may use genetic testing . The sample include participant name . Participants notify test show something urgent DCM/RCM . Researchers think sort problem rare . - Questionnaire DCM/RCM - Sputum ( mucus ) collection . They spit cup . - Participants 1 follow-up visit per year 5 year . They blood test . They may procedures treat DCM/RCM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coccidioidomycosis ( CM ) fungal disease endemic southwestern United States , Northern Mexico , part South America . About 150,000 CM infection estimate occur United States year , 60 % think asymptomatic . Symptomatic patient typically present respiratory syndrome liken community-acquired pneumonia , le 1 % infected individual think develop refractory disease without dissemination . Disseminated infection rarely resolve spontaneously , although organ affect , tend involve skin , lymph node , central nervous system and/or skeletal system . While risk disseminate infection increase immune suppress patient , many individual significant prior history develop debilitating , widespread infection . Causes refractory and/or disseminated disease previously healthy individual recently begin elucidate , include mutation IFNy/IL-12 pathway . We seek well characterize genetic predisposition treatment refractory and/or disseminate coccidioidomycosis . Specifically , examine multiple immune factor , characterize demographic patient afflicted disease , examine phylogeny infect organism . This information reveal endogenous pathway might target therapeutic intervention .</detailed_description>
