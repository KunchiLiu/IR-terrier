	<brief_title>Point Care Ultrasound Suspected Small Bowel Obstruction Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : An estimated 15 % emergency department ( ED ) patient admitted surgical unit abdominal pain ultimately diagnose small bowel obstruction ( SBO ) ( 1 ) . The work patient possible SBO direct patient history , physical examination pre-test probability . Relatively insensitive abdominal x-ray ( AXR ) commonly order screening test , compute tomography ( CT ) image often necessary confirm exclude diagnosis SBO . This diagnostic process time consume , costly expose patient ionize radiation . Interest point-of-care ( POC ) ultrasonography ( US ) evaluation suspect SBO increase recent year . A grow body literature suggest US sensitive specific compare AXR diagnosis SBO ( 1-3 ) . US also confer benefit le radiation exposure rapid decision-making . CT generally consider diagnostic criterion standard SBO , effective use POC US may reduce need CT image expedite care patient suspect SBO . Currently , five emergency physician ( EP ) staff York Hospital ED fellowship train POC US . These physician fully credentialed already perform ED base evaluation small bowel obstruction . We intend evaluate performance EP-performed POC US diagnosis SBO ED patient . This study would primarily investigate accuracy ultrasound compare criterion standard abdominal CT result , intraoperative diagnosis , discharge diagnosis . Study design : This prospective , observational study adult ED patient suspect SBO . ED nurse , resident , attending perform initial screen potential enrollee . Once consent enrol , study sonographer interview examine patient , preferably labs AXR result . The ultrasound must complete adequate image obtain advanced imaging modality complete . Ultrasound four abdominal quadrant perform use `` mow lawn '' technique describe previously literature ( 4 ) . The ultrasound perform five US fellowship-trained EPs staff , well two current emergency ultrasound fellows three emergency medicine resident . All participate identification , consent , enrollment patient study . Trainees undergo hour-long educational session POC US SBO involve lecture hand training . Methods proper consent data collection include . Blinded review ultrasound already plan component study design treatment decision make base trainee ultrasound unless supervise credentialed faculty member . The five faculty EP sonographers already fully credentialed POC ultrasound familiar technique SBO . No additional ultrasound training required participant . A `` Bedside '' standardize data collection form use bedside record ultrasound find clinical information . The sonographer designate ultrasound `` positive small bowel obstruction , '' `` negative small bowel obstruction , '' `` indeterminate '' base exam ultrasound finding . A second sonographer , blind clinical information primary sonographer 's ultrasound interpretation , review de-identified ultrasound image remotely . This over-reading sonographer record interpretation secondary finding `` Blinded Reviewer '' standardize data collection sheet . Only fully credentialed , fellowship-trained EPs serve secondary , blind reviewer . Current fellows resident involve study review ultrasound image capacity . CT imaging , intraoperative report , discharge diagnosis utilized determine final outcome patient 's clinical course . At time , third `` Follow Up '' standardize data collection sheet use record patient outcomes demographic information . In general , CT report use criterion standard POC US finding compare sensitivity/specificity calculate . If CT obtain , operative report ( ) serve criterion standard . If patient receive CT image undergo surgical intervention , discharge diagnosis serve criterion standard . Study population recruitment method : The study population include adult patient present emergency department abdominal pain clinical suspicion SBO . A treat attend physician resident evaluate patient . If concern SBO , treat physician contact one ultrasound credentialed EP sonographers perform POC US evaluate possible SBO . This process current practice standard ED . At point , EP sonographer approach patient regard study . If patient agrees participate , EP sonographer obtain informed consent . Of note , patient 's treatment unchanged , regardless whether he/she consent participation study . The POC US obtain either case , standard clinical practice ED . Agreeing participate simply allow study team collect data review chart upon discharge hospital . The study sonographer obtain consent . Data collect : The follow data record : - Patients initial - Patient Medical Record Number ( MRN ) /Financial Number ( FIN ) - Age - Sex - Height - Weight - Chief complaint - Presence/location abdominal pain - Symptom duration - Associated symptom ( i.e . nausea/vomiting , diarrhea , etc . ) - Visualization small bowel ? - Maximum inner diameter small bowel ? - Presence `` to-and-fro '' peristalsis ? - Edema wall small bowel ? - Presence free fluid surround small bowel ? - Presence sonographic transition point ? - Diagnostic impression sonographer - Diagnostic impression blind reviewer - XR finding - CT diagnosis - Operative report classification - Time patient placement ED bed - Time consultation ED discharge - Discharge diagnosis Data analysis : For primary outcome , data use calculate sensitivity specificity POC US diagnosis SBO compare criterion standard CT operative report . For secondary outcome , likelihood ratio specific ultrasound finding determine . Inter-rater agreement bedside sonographer blind reviewer calculate use Cohen 's kappa coefficient . Continuous , time-to-disposition data compare utilizing two-tailed t-test . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS software ( IBM , Armonk , NY ) . Risks risk management : There minimal risk patient participate study since ultrasound non-invasive know safe . There slight risk participant ' privacy confidentiality breach . Standard precaution take ensure privacy confidentiality maintain study . Benefits : Patients whose ultrasound highly suspicious small bowel obstruction may refer directly surgery without image perform . In instance study patient would benefit reduced radiation exposure faster referral appropriate surgical care . The result study may use improve future patient care . Compensation / incentive research-related cost : No compensation give participant . There research-related cost . Alternative procedure : Patients refuse participate study quality treatment affect way . Research material , record , confidentiality : Research record store locked office , file cabinet , computer use password-protected encryption . Subject inform consent : We seek document informed consent Heath Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . ED patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion ask would like participate study research sonographer time ultrasound . If patient agrees participate , informed consent document give review . If patient decline participate continue treatment course Emergency Department . References relevant literature : 1 . Taylor , Mark R. Nadim Lalani . Adult Small Bowel Obstruction .
