	<brief_title>Paleo Versus Healthy ADA Diets Treatment Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome ( PCOS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Experimental Design Methods This prospective , open label , randomize diet intervention study do adult participant PCOS . After sign informed consent , participant ask eat recommend ADA diet two week ( run period ) . Participants baseline testing , include : urine blood test evaluate insulin resistance ( fast glucose insulin , 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test ) , electrolytes assess acid-base status , ovarian volume testosterone level measure assess severity PCOS , questionnaires menstrual frequency , eat habit stress . Participants randomize either high fruit vegetable Paleo Diet 8 month standard ADA-recommended diet first 4 month follow Paleo Diet 4 month . All test repeat 4 month ( crossover point ) completion diet 8 month . The primary outcome variable menstrual cycle frequency ovarian volume , secondary outcome include metabolic profile eating/behavior questionnaire Procedures 1 . Diet : All participant initially give diet information ADA diet `` Run In '' period , include print ADA diet instruction advice caloric intake . The ADA diet include food exclude Paleo Diet , grain , legume dairy product also contain less potassium . All participant instruct add salt food cook eating . At 2 week , participant randomize Paleo Diet arm ADA diet arm . Participants Paleo Diet arm require `` ramp-up '' phase one week ( start 1 Paleo meal per day , two , meal Paleolithic-type menu , contain approximately average 142 gram protein 12,200 mg potassium per 3000 kcal . Participants ADA diet arm continue run-in diet . After 16 week , participant ADA arm change Paleo arm . They also require `` ramp-up '' phase 1 week . In previous study , see crossover effect one month go Paleo ADA diet , ADA Paleo arm . We give participant pertinent website write information specific diet , well sample menu . We give participant Paleo arm list food avoid ( e.g. , dairy , grain , legume , process food ) . The main obstacle compliance outpatient diet include cost , amount time need , ignorance get specific kind food . We give list various supermarket farmer market time date , advise participant make batch food weekend freeze , family support , try get involved support . 2 . Monitoring dietary compliance : We monitor compliance number way . We recruit four nutrition student volunteer UC Berkeley , work closely participant help adapt study diet everyday living situation . The nutrition student help design material give participant , well give dietary advice . We work number electronic social medium method keep track subject eat . These include : - Initially daily , near daily contact first week diet , least weekly contact , least monthly contact . - online data system monitor food activity ( e.g. , USDA super tracker , myfitnesspal , etc ) . - tweet texts ask subject go elink answer question , e.g. , eat grain today ? The answer download database compile reflect dietary compliance subject . We also develop secure website participant group discuss others problem solution use . Last , also assess 24 hour urine creatinine , sodium , potassium 0 , 16 32 week . Both diet high potassium lower sodium typical American diet . Although expect subject motivate enough follow diet , previous study find subject honest eating , reflect 24 hour urine excretion potassium sodium . Assays : Samples draw time 0 ; week 8 ; week 16 ; week 24 week 32 . We collect serum , plasma urine timepoints banking . The following test perform time ( table 2 ) : 1 . CBC , Chemical profile ; blood lipid ; cardiovascular risk factor inflammatory cytokine adipokines ( time 0 , week 16 , week 32 ) : Electrolytes , liver function test , fast glucose , lipid panel insulin level measure Quest lab . PAI-1 measured colorimetric assay ( Chemicon , Temecula , CA ) . Homocysteine , fibrinogen , hsCRP ICAM-1 assay UCSF clinical laboratory use standard analytical method . Commercial kit use measure fast serum non-esterified fatty acid ( Wako Diagnostics kit ; Richmond Virginia ) ; serum TNF-α , IL-6 , adiponectin leptin ( Quantikine HS high sensitivity ELISA ; R &amp; D Systems , Minneapolis , MN 2 . Systemic oxidative stress ( time 0 , week 16 , 32 ) : measure 4 serum marker oxidative stress ; protein carbonyl ( product protein oxidation ) , TBARS ( measurement lipid peroxidation ) , TRAP ( measure total antioxidant activity ) , isoprostanes ( form peroxidation arachidonic acid lipoproteins membrane ) . Blood sample draw fasted state initial screen ALA treatment . Protein carbonyl , TBARS , TRAP perform UC Davis Clinical Laboratories employ standard technique . Serum 8-isoprostane-F2α measure KRONOS Science laboratory , Phoenix Arizona . We also measure urine marker oxidative stress CRLA treatment . These include 8-isoprostane-F2α , 8-hydroxy guanosine ( marker oxidize DNA ) . These urine assay perform KRONOS Science laboratory , Phoenix Arizona Dr Jack Roberts , Vanderbilt University . 3 . Telomere assessment . The length telomere , DNA cap end chromosome , emerge indicator stress-related biological aging : Data implicate accelerate telomere shorten context increase psychological stress stress arousal [ 10 , 11 ] Blood drawn license phlebotomist ( 4 mL telomere assessment ) baseline ( 0 week ) 16-weeks assay telomere length . Samples frozen transfer dry ice Blackburn Laboratory UCSF , locate 600 16th Street , San Francisco , California , laboratory technician . Assays complete accord polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method.. 4 . 24 hr urine collection . collection per clinical protocol . We measure volume , Na , K , pH , creatinine calcium Reproductive testing : Subjects undergo assessment 1 ) SHBG androgen level : total testosterone , androstenedione DHEAS ; 2 ) clinical hyperandrogenism : hirsutism modify Ferriman-Gallwey acne score ; 3 ) menstrual cyclicity ( cycle interval pattern ) ; 4 ) ovarian morphology ( follicle count ovarian volume ) . Androgen level ( time 0 , week 16 , 32 ) : Two serum sample obtain 30 minute apart.. Serum isolate aliquoted future analysis androstenedione ( A ) , testosterone ( T ) , DHEAS , 17 hydroxyprogesterone ( 17-OHP ) SHBG . Clinical hyperandrogenism : The presence extent hirsutism determine use modification Ferriman-Gallwey ( FG ) score method [ 12 ] acne score accord American Academy Dermatology .Subjects request avoid mechanical treatment hair removal 4 week prior baseline visit list treatment utilized study frequency . Menstrual cyclicity : Menstrual frequency assess menstrual frequency ratio describe Elkind-Hirsch [ 13 ] menstrual event normalize normal interval 12 menses per year ( MFR=1.0 ) , instance , 6 cycle per year would MFR 0.5 . Ovarian morphology : All subject undergo transvaginal ultrasound ( TVUS ) obtain antral follicle count baseline , 8 16 week . The study investigator image leave right adnexal area two plane , make measurement transverse , longitudinal , anteroposterior diameter ovary use electronic caliper Shimadzu SDU-450XL machine variable 4-8 mHz vaginal transducer . The examination adnexa ensure adequate opportunity locate organ . Inability locate adnexa age group le 1 % ( internal data ) . All echo-free structure ovary regard follicle . Follicles mean diameter ( two dimension ) 2 10 mm count . Calculation follicle ( 2-10mm ) , well 2- 5mm , possible number record separately . The total two ovary ( 2- 10mm ) consider AFC . The volume ovary calculate measure three perpendicular diameter apply formula ellipsoid : ( L x H x W x π/6 ) . Data enter directly onto scannable datasheets . Examination also determine whether cysts/other abnormality exist provide image document number type abnormality . Clinical alert generate ovarian cyst great 3cm diameter solid adnexal mass size . Dr. Huddleston responsible relay information clinical alert patient physician . 5 . Body composition : Total body water ( TBW ) extracellular water ( ECW ) volume determine bioimpedance spectroscopy ( Intermed Inc , Melbourne Australia ) baseline , 16 32 week . Subjects also weigh visit . We also waist hip measurement baseline , 16 32 week . 6 . Blood pressure ( BP ) heart rate ( HR ) : These measure visit morning 10 minute rest sit position use automated oscillometric device ( Dinamap , Critikon Inc ) program obtain 3 reading within 3 minute , calculate average daily pressure j. Questionnaires : Participants complete follow questionnaire per schedule specify Table 1 . Questionnaires tap psychological experience , health eat behavior , adherence .</detailed_description>
