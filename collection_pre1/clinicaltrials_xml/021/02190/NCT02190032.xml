	<brief_title>Modified Angled Tube v . Conventional Angled Tube Double-lumen Endotracheal Tube Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inserting double lumen endotracheal tube somewhat difficult single lumen tube intubation large outer diameter rigid feature . Moreover , airway ax ( oral- , pharyngeal- , laryngotracheal axis ) always straight sniff condition . Therefore , make easy insert double-lumen tube reduce tube-related complication , try compare individually angle-modified tube manufacturer-provided-angled tube .</detailed_description>
