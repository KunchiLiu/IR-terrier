MMB develop increase access Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ; R01 MH066992 ) , empirically support prophylactic group treatment easily sequence acute phase antidepressant pharmacotherapy . Results open trial MMB ( N=100 ) show effect size d=1.09 pre post treatment reduction depression score among patient RDS d=1.54 quasi-experimental comparison patient receive usual care , average reduction 1.98 point PHQ-9 MMB patient . The investigator propose pragmatic randomized clinical trial MMB evaluate effectiveness reduce RDS recurrently depress patient . Patients member Kaiser-Permanente Colorado ( N = 460 ) , age 18 75 , score &gt; 5 &lt; 9 PHQ-9 , remission MDD randomize 1:1 either usual depression care pathway ( DepCare ) Mindful Mood Balance ( MMB ) +DepCare . The investigator plan test whether patient receive MMB+DepCare show great reduction RDS 8 week 12 month follow , receive DepCare alone . The investigator also interested examine whether few patient MMB+DepCare relapse follow high end state functioning quality life . In order examine cost associate add online treatment Depression Care Pathways KPCO , investigator calculate marginal cost per additional number depression free day ( DFDs ) patient .
