	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) one frequently encounter prognostically significant complication cardiovascular surgery . However , definitive treatment intervene development AKI , therefore , preventive strategy major issue . By time , incidence AKI cardiovascular surgery report 3-50 % base study various definition AKI different patient cohort . Development unified definition AKI early 2000s open new era AKI study . According previous study , aortic surgery , especially thoracic aortic surgery know highly prevalent AKI , consider cause use total circulatory arrest ( TCA ) , relatively high number emergency case , combine malperfusion syndrome surgery relatively complicate surgical procedure . However , many study AKI thoracic aortic surgery low incidence urgent clinical presentation aortic pathology , hinder large randomize control study . Moreover , conflict report incidence risk factor AKI thoracic aortic surgery , conclusive result make . Therefore , study design investigate incidence risk factor thoracic aortic surgery due dissection .</brief_summary>
