	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether difference diagnostic accuracy cover slide base slide EUS-FNA cytopathologic sample patient previously suspect pancreatic cancer radiologic test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Base Cover Slide From Endoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle Aspiration Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1. background 1 . Pancreatic cancer challenge malignancy diagnosis treatment . 2 . Recently , EUS-FNA play important role diagnose pancreatic cancer . 3 . Samples EUS-FNA send follow three type preparation . - cytologic smear ( pull apart method ) - cell block - histologic biopsy 4 . In cytologic smear method , endoscopists tend send many slide , pathologist want minimal slide warrant diagnostic accuracy . 5 . Therefore go find point contact high diagnostic yield minimal overload pathologist . 2 . Method 1 . We go enrolled patient suspect pancreatic cancer previous radiologic test . 2 . One identical skilled endoscopist performs EUS-FNA multiple puncture . 3 . We get total 8 pair slide ( = 8 cover + 8 base ) . 4 . All cover slide collect bottle-A , base slide bottle-B . 5 . One identical skilled pathologist inspects slide blind method . ( She show label bottle know bottle A B . ) 6 . She record positive negative bottle . ( If one slide positive malignant cell , bottle positive . ) 7 . In manner , collect subject ' cytopathologic result pair outcome . All possible combination follow four example : - ( cover/base ) = ( positive/positive ) = ( +/+ ) - ( cover/base ) = ( positive/negative ) = ( +/- ) - ( cover/base ) = ( negative/positive ) = ( -/+ ) - ( cover/base ) = ( negative/negative ) = ( -/- ) 8 . Then go take two-sided non-inferiority test proportion use McNemar 's test .</detailed_description>
