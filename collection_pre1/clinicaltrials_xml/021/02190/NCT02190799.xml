	<detailed_description>World knowledge virus accumulate data clinical presentation infect patient common treatment , include ribavirin , interferon methylprednisolone , lack evidence . Although drug anti- coronavirus ( CoV ) activity identify , yet anti- MERs- CoV drug approve vaccine yet develop . Previous report viral infection include SARS suggest convalescent plasma serum effective treatment available emergency . A recently complete systematic review meta-analysis University Nottingham - World Health Organization Collaborating Center indicate convalescent plasma therapy may promise near-term therapy patient MERS- CoV infection . In study , investigator study pharmacokinetics immunoglobulin response convalescent plasma administration order inform much large study investigate efficacy convalescent plasma . Plasma collect patient recently recover MERS-CoV , Health Care Workers potential exposure test anti MERS-CoV serology RT-PCR obtain consent . This convalescent plasma store blood bank per policy procedure . Patients MERS-CoV positive meeting eligibility criterion receive 2 unit convalescent plasma . Clinical data well standard laboratory study collect baseline , 30 min first dose , 30 min second dose , day 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 hospital stay enrollment .</detailed_description>
