	<brief_summary>There approximately 250,000 hip fracture US every year , intertrochanteric ( IT ) fracture ( fracture occur femoral head ) account nearly half fracture . The use intramedullary ( IM ) nail fixation IT femur fracture become well-accepted increasingly common procedure among orthopaedic traumatologists , standard care institution . While advancement intramedullary nail fixation make relatively efficient procedure , placement lag screw femoral head still remain challenging step procedure . Inaccurate placement lead screw cut-out , one commonly report complication IM nail fixation . Previous work show lag screw position important factor reduce screw cut-out . This step procedure time demand often require several intraoperative radiograph accurate placement . Recently develop computer-assisted navigation system provide surgeon ability track screw placement real-time . This could allow improved screw placement potentially reduce radiation exposure patient surgeon . To date , potential advantage computer-assisted navigation examine . The primary objective study examine whether use Stryker 's ADAPT computer-assisted navigation Gamma nail fixation result improve lag screw placement . The secondary objective examine whether use ADAPT Gamma nail fixation reduce intraoperative radiation exposure.Our hypothesis difference lag screw placement ( i.e . tip apex distance measurement ) procedures use ADAPT system versus conventional technique Gamma nail fixation . Additionally , hypothesize difference radiation exposure ( i.e . fluoroscopy time ) procedure use ADAPT system versus conventional technique Gamma nail fixation .</brief_summary>
