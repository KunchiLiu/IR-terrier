	<brief_summary>Midazolam rapid-acting benzodiazepine , short half-life ( approximately 1.9 hour ) primarily metabolise CYP3A . Omeprazole selective proton pump inhibitor substrate use reduce gastric acid secretion . Omeprazole primarily metabolise CYP2C19 . Midazolam omeprazole use probe drug clinical pharmacology study evaluate clinical CYP3A CYP2C19 drug interaction , respectively . Furthermore EMA FDA guidance drug interaction recommend use drug evaluation . The aim study assess effect PQ912 PK midazolam omeprazole . In vitro study demonstrate PQ912 inhibits several CYP enzyme , include CYP3A4 CYP2C19 expect exposure level patient , potential inhibit enzymes in-vivo . This study therefore plan investigate potential change PK midazolam omeprazole due effect PQ912 steady-state . In clinical practice likely co-administration PQ912 drug metabolise via CYP3A and/or CYP2C19 enzymes occur . This study provide important information requirement dose adjustment contraindication circumstance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open-label , crossover , fix sequence study healthy male subject . Thirty six ( 36 ) subject participate study enrol two group 18 ( Groups 1 2 ) . If PK data Group 1 demonstrate clinically important inhibition CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19 enzymes second optional group ( Group 2 ) might study low dose level PQ912 . Each subject participate one treatment period , reside CRU Day -1 ( day dose ) Day 7 ( last PK sample occasion ) . All subject return post study visit 5 7 day final dose . Dose Regimen : Each subject receive single oral dos midazolam omeprazole morning Day 1 . On morning Day 2 , subject commence multiple dose regimen PQ912 , continue 5 day total . Subjects Group 1 ( necessary ) Group 2 receive PQ912 twice daily ( bid ) Days 2 6 inclusive subject Group 2 receive PQ912 bid Days 2 6 inclusive . On morning Day 6 subject give single oral dos midazolam omeprazole co-administered PQ912 .</detailed_description>
