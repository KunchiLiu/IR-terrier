	<brief_summary>Background : - Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death American men . A chemical call radiotracer help doctor get image type cancer . Researchers want test radiotracer call 18F-DCFBC . Objective : - To see radiotracer 18F-DCFBC identify site prostate cancer body . Eligibility : - Men age 18 prostate cancer . The cancer must newly diagnose , relapse , spread outside prostate . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They give blood sample . - Participants divide three group . Group 1 : people cancer prostate schedule surgical prostate removal biopsy NIH . Group 2 : people prostate remove radiation therapy rise prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) without sign disease . Group 3 : people whose cancer spread area body . - Participants 18F-DCFBC injected vein image PET/CT camera . During scan , lie back scanner table . - Group 1 magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . A tube place rectum . Coils may wrap around outside pelvis . Participants contrast agent inject intravenous line . - Group 3 another PET/CT scan different radiotracer , 18F NaF , within 21 day 18F-DCFBC scan look prostate cancer bone . - Group 3 repeat two PET/CT scan 4-6 month initial scan . - A day scan , participant contact follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - Prostate cancer second lead cause cancer death American men . - Current method image advanced prostate cancer ( CT bone scan ) non specific new , specific molecular imaging probe seek . - Many prostate cancer express prostate specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) transmembrane protein NAALADase enzymatic activity . PSMA also express angiogenesis otherwise limited expression normal tissue . - 18F-DCFBC radiolabeled PET agent bind high affinity PSMA whole-body non-invasive functional imaging , may provide new information expression PSMA . Primary Objective - To assess ability 18F-DCFBC differentiate tumorous nontumorous tissue localize , recurrent ( base rise PSA post treatment ) metastatic prostate cancer Eligibility - Subject great equal 18 year old - ECOG 0-2 adenocarcinoma prostate fit criteria one following : - ARM 1 -- Patients know localized prostate cancer soft tissue lesion least 6mm great . -- -A multiparametric MRI ( standard care NIH Clinical Center ) must perform within 4 month of18F-DCFBC injection finding suggestive prostate cancer confirm histopathology . - ARM 2 - Patients biochemical prostate cancer relapse definitive treatment - For patient status post radiation therapy prostate cancer , PSA increase post radiation therapy nadir - OR - For patient status post prostatectomy , PSA &gt; /=0.2 ng/ml - Nonspecific evidence disease standard image modality - ARM 3 - Patients identifiable metastatic disease conventional imaging modality . If soft tissue metastasis , one lesion must measure 6mm great . Patients must confirmation prostate cancer prior 18F-DCFBCimaging . Design This single site 3-arm study enrol total 110 evaluable patient : Arm 1 include 12 patient presumed localized prostate cancer schedule undergo prostatectomy biopsy within 4 month enrollment ; Arm 2 include 78 patient biochemical recurrence without evidence metastasis conventional imaging ; Arm 3 include 20 patient know metastatic disease may may or/scheduled begin therapeutic intervention . Patients presume localized disease undergo standard care , clinical multiparametric endorectal coil MRI NCI Molecular Imaging Clinic within 4 month screen . Patients Arm 3 undergo 2 imaging session : baseline 4-6 month follow-up . Clinical record ( include PSA ) treatment ( ) occur image interval must available . All patient Arm 3 also undergo Na18F PET/CT evaluation bone metastases part protocol . In order allow small number nonevaluable patient , accrual ceiling set 125 .</detailed_description>
