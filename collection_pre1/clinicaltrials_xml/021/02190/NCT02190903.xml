	<brief_title>A Trial To Assess Risk Delirium Older Adults Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery With Spinal General Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Overall objective Overall Objectives Specific Aims 1 . To compare effect spinal versus general anesthesia rate postoperative delirium hip fracture surgery . We hypothesize rate delirium hip fracture surgery low among patient receive spinal versus general anesthesia . 2 . To develop , field-test , conduct qualitative evaluation protocol procedure plan multicenter trial test association anesthesia technique survival recovery function activity daily live ambulatory ability six month hip fracture . Primary outcome variable ( ) The primary outcome variable rate delirium hip fracture surgery . Background Delirium , disturbance consciousness change cognition develop short period time , ( 1 ) complicate 2.6 million hospitalization among U.S. adult age 65 old year . ( 2,3 ) Patients experience delirium hospitalization face increase risk morbidity , mortality , functional disability . ( 4 ) Each year , delirium account $ 6.9 billion Medicare hospital expenditure . ( 5 ) Delirium occur 35 % 65 % 320,000 old U.S. adult hospitalize hip fracture year . ( 6 ) While adverse survival functional outcome common hip fracture , ( 7 ) single episode delirium double odds new functional dependence new ambulatory disability six month fracture , triple odds death new nursing home placement . ( 8 ) Compared general endotracheal anesthesia , spinal anesthesia may decrease incidence postoperative delirium hip fracture surgery . Small randomize trial anesthesia type hip fracture suggest 50 % low risk acute confusion hip fracture surgery spinal anesthesia , ( 9 ) heterogeneity outcome definition measurement strategy employ past trial , along use historical anesthesia practice limit applicability current practice . As result limitation , clinical equipoise continue exist regard optimal anesthetic technique hip fracture care . Compared general anesthesia , spinal anesthesia may offer potential benefit limit decreased delirium . These may include decreased intraoperative blood loss , decreased risk postoperative thromboembolic event , respiratory infection malignant hyperthermia . At time , spinal anesthesia may associate great hypotension general anesthesia , may carry small risk bleed infection site spinal injection discomfort block placement . Relative spinal anesthesia , general anesthesia may offer benefit hemodynamic stability . At present , spinal anesthesia demonstrate retrospective observational study associate low in-hospital mortality hip fracture ( 10 ) , meta-analysis randomized trial inconclusive regard mortality difference . ( 9 ) Reflecting state clinical equipoise pattern anesthesia care differ widely country provider , reflect large role provider practice style determine anesthesia care hip fracture . For example , recent survey UK anesthesiologists , 76 % indicate routinely perform hip fracture surgeries spinal anesthesia ( 11 ) . In contrast , recent U.S. data suggest approximately 80 % hip fracture surgery perform general anesthesia , wide variability practice across hospital . ( 10 ) While variation may part reflect difference patient preference , current state knowledge regard risk benefit differ type anesthesia inadequate support appropriately inform medical decision-making either patient health care provider . The UKs national institute Health Care Excellence ( NICE ) strongly recommend clinical trial provide additional information regard clinical cost effectiveness differ anesthesia type hip fracture , state unable identify recent randomise control trialsthat fully address question [ available ] evidence old reflect current practice . Study Design Phase II Design This randomize , control trial spinal versus general anesthesia test effect anesthesia type rate postoperative delirium hip fracture surgery . Study duration It expect study begin enrollment June 2013 . The enrollment subject project complete May 2014 data analysis follow . The study hope complete June 2015 . The length participation subject 5 day .</detailed_description>
