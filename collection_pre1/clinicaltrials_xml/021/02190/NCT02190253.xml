	<brief_summary>Background : - The hepatitis E virus cause acute hepatitis usually go away . Researchers France study people receive liver kidney transplant . They find hepatitis E may go away people . It become chronic . This cause serious liver disease . More half people organ transplant hepatitis E seem get chronic infection . Researchers want find hepatitis E happen often patient liver , kidney , small bowel transplant United States . If , want know . They want know chronic hepatitis E become important medical problem . This research might help improve care people transplant . It also might help researcher prevent spread hepatitis E. Objective : - To see many patient receive wait certain transplant antibody hepatitis E virus . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 liver , kidney , liver kidney , small bowel transplant , wait list one . Design : - Participants enrol 3 transplant center . - Participants complete questionnaire . They ask possible risk factor hepatitis E exposure . - Participants blood sample drawn needle place vein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatitis E virus infection commonly present acute self-limiting hepatitis develop world . However report chronic hepatitis E may develop immunocompromised subject renal liver transplant recipient . Progression cirrhosis also report patient chronic hepatitis E infection . We hypothesize immunosuppression post-organ transplantation predispose individual increase susceptibility hepatitis E infection . Therefore , study , wish determine seroprevalence antibody hepatitis E IgG organ transplant recipient ( immunosuppressed population ) compare patient organ transplant waitlist ( immunosuppressed ) . We plan study sample date 300 organ transplant recipient 300 patient waitlist liver , kidney intestinal transplantation control age , gender , organ transplant center . Three transplant center ( 2 mid-Atlantic area one Mid-West ) enroll 100 case control . A minimum 50 case site liver transplant recipient . Cases stratify base number year post transplant one , two great equal three year . Consecutive patient eligible agree participate study enrol . A brief questionnaire ass risk factor acquisition hepatitis E administer 8mls blood drawn serum separator tube anti HEV IgG , anti HEV IgM HEV RNA test analysis NIH . Subjects confirm acute chronic HEV infection manage accord standard care respective transplant center .</detailed_description>
