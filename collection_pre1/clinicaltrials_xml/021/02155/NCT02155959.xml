	<brief_summary>Abstract Purpose : To evaluate visual performance rotational stability Tecnis Toric one-piece IOL ( AMO , USA ) first 3 post-operative month Design : Prospective single center study Setting : VIROS - Vienna Institute Research Ocular Surgery , Karl Landsteiner Institute , Hanusch Hospitel , Vienna , Austria Methods : In prospective study patient age-related cataract corneal astigmatism 1.0 3.0 D measure IOL-Master 500 ( Carl Zeiss Meditec AG , Germany ) include . Pre-operatively , rotate Scheimpflug scan ( Pentacam HR , Oculus , Germany ) perform cornea mark sit position slit lamp . Patients recieved single-piece toric hydrophobic acrylic IOL ( Tecnis Toric , AMO , USA ) . Immediately 3 month surgery retroillumination photograph take assess rotational stability IOL . Additionally , Autorefraction ( Topcon , USA ) , subjective refraction , uncorrected distance correct visual acuity , keratometry , Scheimpflug ocular wavefront ( WASCA , Carl Zeiss Meditec AG , Germany ) measurement perform 3 month follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Whereas first design toric intraocular lens ( toric IOLs ) early 1990 's show IOL rotation 30° one fifth patient , modern toric IOLs typically show mean absolute rotation 3° 5° , would result loss 10 % 15 % astigmatism reduce effect toric IOL . Rotational stability toric IOL depend interaction toric IOL posterior capsule , whereas misalignment toric IOL ( define study difference 3 month postoperatively measure axis toric IOL intend axis ) depend several factor additionally rotational stability . Intraoperatively , misalignment may happen due cyclotorsion eye lie position due peribulbar anaesthesia , due imprecision surgeon position IOL relative intend meridian . Both imprecision deal pre-operative marking eye sit position diligence surgeon . Postoperatively , IOL may rotate undersized capsule bag due capsule shrinkage take place fibrotic contraction bag postoperative period . Since current IOLs slightly oversized capsule bag , former observe rarely would likely long eye tend large capsule bag diameter . However , capsule bag shrinkage think induce rotation IOLs open-loop haptics due asymmetry haptic design . Typical IOL haptic design improve rotational stability either plate haptic IOLs special Z-haptic shape open-loop haptics attempt counteract rotational effect compression shrink bag . However , IOL design think downside . The former seem increase risk posterior capsule opacification due less effective lens epithelial barrier effect optic edge may also show rotation bag immediately surgery due shorter haptic overall length . The latter IOL design , Z-haptic IOL , cumbersome implant may prone damage implantation . Aim study evaluate rotational stability novel single-piece hydrophobic acrylic toric IOL C-haptic design .</detailed_description>
