	<brief_summary>The goal proposal test feasibility effectiveness cardiovascular exercise promote brain health improve relate symptom ( e.g. , hear sound , feel emotionally detach self others ) , cognitive difficulty ( trouble memory learning ) , every day social-occupational functioning youth imminent risk develop psychotic disorder schizophrenia . Understanding exercise may protect improve health brain area implicate major contribute factor onset psychosis may lead path-breaking new intervention suffer many side effect , cost , barrier characterize treatment currently available group . Because significant portion high-risk youth go develop psychotic disorder short period , intervene stage may help improve clinical course ultimately prevent onset devastate prevalent mental illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Markers Medial Temporal Health Youth At-risk Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence animal literature , healthy population , schizophrenia study suggest regular exercise positively affect integral function neurogenesis , synaptic plasticity cognition . Likewise , preliminary evidence suggest aerobic activity associate improve quality life low level symptom patient schizophrenia . Because exercise find stimulate human medial temporal neurogenesis , related abnormality widely observe study schizophrenia , physical activity may important intervention . During psychosis prodrome , period immediately proceed formal onset psychotic disorder , adolescent experience subtle attenuate symptom couple cognitive deterioration global decline socio-occupational functioning anywhere 10-35 % go transition psychotic disorder schizophrenia two-year period . Despite promise exercise intervention , critical role medial temporal lobe abnormality play etiological model psychosis , experimental study aerobic exercise ultra-high risk youth ( UHR ) . Understanding potential benefit aerobic exercise UHR youth integral prodrome viable period intervention considerable brain development still occur . Further , challenge associate many available intervention , increase level potential find neuroplasticity-based intervention , understand effect exercise respective brain-behavior hold considerable promise . Experimental research sorely need determine prescribe aerobic exercise stimulate medial-temporal neurogenesis ameliorate cognition symptoms/functioning vital group . In proposed study , expert team experience prodromal exercise investigator follow group 15 UHR adolescent young adult ( age 16-24 ) 12 week exercise trial determine level exercise intensity/frequency tolerable participant optimal improve aerobic fitness ( 65 % VO2max 2 session per week versus 85 % intensity 3 session per peek ) improvements aerobic fitness ( i.e. , VO2max , VO2peak , ventilatory threshold ) associate increase medial temporal structure volume ( hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus ) accompany improvement cognitive function ( i.e. , include task know recruit heavily medial temporal structure ) well symptomatology social/role functioning . If benchmark meet , data use streamline three-year rater-blind control trial ( 15 UHR-exercise , 15 UHR waitlist-control ) determine efficacy intervention promote medial temporal health well accompany cognitive , clinical , socio-occupational function improvement . Participants follow 24-months determine intervention affect clinical course transition psychosis . Taken together , study important understanding lesson necessary planning future large-scale trial , potential shed light promise new treatment UHR youth .</detailed_description>
