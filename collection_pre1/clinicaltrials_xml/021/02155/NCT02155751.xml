Once medically pre-screened contraindication walk regularly , woman approach member research team . Each woman record 3 consecutive day ( include one weekend day ) food intake diary also record number step take time period , use pedometer instruction wear record daily step . Once return , woman randomize one three group computer generate model . The order randomization keep clinic opaque envelope select research assistant inclusion study confirm . The three group describe ; 1 . The NELIP group ( N=10 ) full intervention ( 1 ) introduce walk program walk 25 minute , 3 4 time per week , add 2 minute week , 40 minute reach maintained delivery . Each woman give pedometer log sheet keep track daily step initiate self-monitoring behaviour . The dietary program mimic gestational diabetic meal plan : ) individualize total energy intake minimum 2000 kcal/day ( 8360 kilojoule/day ) , take account usual energy intake indicate dietary assessment ( include 3-day food intake record ) restriction 33 % total energy intake ; b ) adjust necessary total carbohydrate intake 40-50 % total energy intake , distribute carbohydrate intake throughout day three balance meal , three snack per day emphasize complex carbohydrate low glycemic index food ; c ) adjust total fat intake 30 % total energy intake ( substitute monounsaturated fatty acid saturate trans-fatty acid ) , remain 30 % dedicate protein intake ; ) meet micronutrient fluid need recommend pregnancy ( 2 ) . 2 . In order tease effectiveness full NELIP , second group ( N=10 ) give exercise component ( ELIP ) NELIP . Once dietary intake assess , group give dietary intervention encourage eat healthy , balanced diet . 3 . The third group ( N=10 ) give nutrition program ( NLIP ) NELIP . They encourage active give exercise intervention . A control group ( N=30 ) also recruit `` My Clinic '' woman undergo care obstetrical program London Health Sciences Centre . The woman match pre-pregnancy BMI , maternal age parity , intervention , attend clinic standard obstetric care follow-up . Women group 1-3 weekly weight gain record delivery . Infant gender , body weight , length , neonatal morphometrics ( birth weight : length ratio , BMI , newborn skinfolds , circumference ) placental weight ( placenta : birth weight ratio ) record woman within 6-18 hour birth .

Breast feeding status , maternal weight retention , infant weight/length/BMI/skinfolds/girths growth pattern assess compare WHO Child Growth Standards infant base gender ( see ) . All woman complete Kaiser Physical Activity Questionnaire entry , 34-36 week gestation follow-up appointment track change physical activity .</detailed_description>
