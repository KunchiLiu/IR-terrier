	<brief_title>Everolimus Children With Recurrent Progressive Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ependymoma third common central nervous system neoplasm child , account approximately 10 % childhood brain tumor . Although prognosis child newly-diagnosed completely resect ependymomas often good , child incompletely resect tumor often suffer repeat episode tumor progression die result tumor . The prognosis child recurrent progressive ependymomas especially dismal majority child recurrent progressive ependymomas eventually succumb tumor within 8.7 24 month . At time tumor recurrence , therapeutic option limit . A recent report Merchant co-worker describe several long-term survivor tumor recurrence treat second course radiation therapy . Unfortunately , although chemotherapy occasionally demonstrate anti-tumor activity recurrent ependymoma , responses rarely durable.12 Indeed , recent review Bouffet co-worker conclude frequency durable response recurrent ependymomas chemotherapy disappoint encourage re-evaluation current chemotherapeutic approach intracranial ependymoma study need identify new biological target inform future clinical trial . Everolimus novel derivative rapamycin . It clinical development since 1996 immunosuppressant solid organ transplantation . Everolimus approve Europe global market ( trade name : Certican® ) cardiac renal transplantation , United States ( trade name : Zortress® ) prevention organ rejection kidney transplantation . Everolimus develop oncology Afinitor® approve advanced renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) 2009 . In 2010 , Afinitor® receive United States ( US ) approval patient subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) associate tuberous sclerosis ( TS ) . Everolimus also available Votubia® European Union ( EU ) patient SEGA associate TS . Afinitor® approve `` progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( PNET ) patient unresectable , locally advanced , metastatic disease '' 2011 various country , include US Europe . In 2012 , Afinitor® receive approval treatment postmenopausal woman advance hormone receptor-positive , HER2- negative breast cancer combination exemestane , failure treatment letrozole anastrozole . Furthermore 2012 , Afinitor® receive approval treatment adult patient TSC renal angiomyolipoma require immediate surgery . At cellular molecular level , Everolimus act signal transduction inhibitor . It selectively inhibit mTOR ( mammalian target rapamycin ) , key protein kinase regulate cell growth , proliferation survival . The mTOR kinase mainly activate via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-Kinase ) pathway AKT/PKB tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC1/2 ) . Mutations component PTEN , negative regulator PI3-kinase , may result dysregulation . Abnormal function various component signal pathway contribute pathophysiology numerous human cancer . Various preclinical model confirm role pathway tumor development . The main known function mTOR include follow : - mTOR function sensor mitogen , growth factor energy nutrient level ; - Facilitating cell-cycle progression G1-S phase appropriate growth condition ; - The PI3K/mTOR pathway frequently dysregulated many human cancer , oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cell mTOR inhibitor ; - PI3-kinase mutation report primary tumor 10-20 % human colorectal cancer ; 16,17 - The loss PTEN protein , either gene deletion functional silencing ( promoter hypermethylation ) , report approximately 60 % primary human colorectal cancer ; - The mTOR pathway involve production pro-angiogenic factor ( i.e. , VEGF ) inhibition endothelial cell growth proliferation ; - Through inactivate eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein activate 40S ribosomal S6 kinase ( i.e. , p70S6K1 ) , mTOR regulate protein translation , include HIF-1 protein . Inhibition mTOR expect lead decrease expression HIF-1 . Everolimus inhibit proliferation range human tumor cell line vitro include line originate lung , breast , prostate , colon , melanoma glioblastoma . IC50s range sub/low nM µM . Everolimus also inhibit proliferation human umbilical vein endothelial cell ( HUVECS ) vitro , particular potency VEGF-induced proliferation suggest Everolimus may also act anti-angiogenic agent . The anti-angiogenic activity Everolimus confirm vivo . Everolimus selectively inhibit VEGF-dependent angiogenic response well tolerated dos . Mice primary metastatic tumor treat Everolimus show significant reduction blood vessel density compare control . The potential Everolimus anti-cancer agent show rodent model . Everolimus orally bioavailable , reside longer tumor tissue plasma subcutaneous mouse xenograft model , demonstrate high tumor penetration rat pancreatic tumor model . The pharmacokinetic profile Everolimus indicate sufficient tumor penetration , need inhibit proliferation endothelial cell tumor cell line deem sensitive Everolimus vitro . Everolimus administer orally daily potent inhibitor tumor growth , well tolerated dos , 11 different mouse xenograft model ( include pancreatic , colon , epidermoid , lung melanoma ) two syngeneic model ( rat pancreatic , mouse orthotopic melanoma ) . These model include tumor line consider sensitive `` relatively resistant '' vitro . In general , Everolimus well tolerate mouse xenograft model standard cytotoxic agent ( i.e. , doxorubicin 5-fluorouracil ) , possess similar anti-tumor activity . Additionally , activity VEGF-impregnated subcutaneous implant model angiogenesis reduce vascularity ( vessel density ) Everolimus-treated tumor ( murine melanoma ) provide evidence vivo effect angiogenesis . It clear molecular determinant predict responsiveness tumor cell Everolimus . Molecular analysis reveal relative sensitivity Everolimus vitro correlate degree phosphorylation ( activation ) AKT/PKB protein kinase S6 ribosomal protein ; case ( i.e. , glioblastoma ) also correlation PTEN status . In vivo study investigate anti-tumor activity Everolimus experimental animal tumor model show Everolimus monotherapy typically reduced tumor cell growth rate rather produce regression . These effect occur within dose range 2.5 mg 10 mg/kg , orally day . In preclinical model , administration Everolimus associate reduction protein phosphorylation target proteins downstream mTOR , notably phosphorylated S6 phosphorylated 4EBP1 , occasionally increase phosphorylated AKT , protein upstream mTOR signal pathway . All significant adverse event observe toxicology study Everolimus mouse , rat , monkey mini-pigs consistent anticipate pharmacological action anti-proliferative immunosuppressant least part reversible 2 4-week recovery period exception change male reproductive organ , notably testes . Rationale : The purpose study evaluate anti-tumor activity Everolimus among child recurrent progressive ependymoma . The rationale study base upon pre-clinical clinical consideration . Recurrent progressive ependymoma incurable limited treatment option . In 2011 , investigator group publish case report describe young child multiply recurrent ependymoma 4 chemotherapy regimen several course radiation therapy objective long lasting response sirolimus ( Rapamune , Pfizer ) . This patient , treat various regimen span 20 month without response , subsequently near complete response sirolimus 18 month duration . Subsequently second child recurrent ependymoma treat sirolimus oral etoposide near-complete response 18 month duration . Furthermore , immunohistochemistry study reveal 20 23 ( 87 % ) pediatric ependymomas immunoreactive phosphorylated S6 , biomarker often predict response mTOR pathway-targeted therapy . Existing data regard anti-tumor activity mTOR inhibitor among child demonstrate mTOR inhibitor well tolerated activity pediatric brain tumor . For example , Franz et al . report five child tuberous sclerosis complex progressive subependymal giant cell astrocytomas treat sirolimus achieve target trough concentration 5 - 15 ng/mL . All tumor demonstrate objective response sirolimus . One patient interrupt sirolimus therapy experience tumor progression respond resumption sirolimus therapy . A subsequent phase III study everolimus compare response 78 patient treat everolimus versus 39 patient treated placebo . 27 78 ( 35 % ) patient everolimus group least 50 % reduction volume subependymal giant cell astrocytomas versus none placebo group ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . Adverse event mostly grade 1 2 patient discontinue treatment adverse event . Biomarkers mTOR pathway activation sensitivity mTOR inhibitor , include phosphorylated S6235/236 , phosphorylated S6240/244 , phosphorylated 4EBP1 , phosphorylated PRAS40 ( pT246 ) , phosphorylated P70S6K , PTEN expression , perform . Although biomarkers , vary degree , correlate mTOR pathway activation sensitivity mTOR inhibitor , study consider exploratory context clinical trial .</detailed_description>
