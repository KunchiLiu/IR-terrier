	<brief_summary>The study aim investigate effect systematic telemedicine intervention , base tigth control principal , platform disease monitoring among patient rheumatoid arthritis . It hypothesize : - A systematic telemedicine intervention target tight control disease activity among patient RA equally effective usual care ( outpatient consultation rheumatologist ) . - There difference effect whether telemedicine consultation carry rheumatologist rheumatology nurse . - Patient satisfaction patient 's general perception involvement treatment increase patient receive telemedicine intervention . - All effect apply short term ( &lt; 6 month ) long term ( &gt; 1 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tight Control Disease Activity Among Patients With RA Based Systematic Telemedicine Treatment Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic disease affect 0.5-1.0 % Danish population . Due expect grow population high proportion elderly prevalence likely increase year come . Untreated RA lead joint destruction disable patient , recent year treatment treatment strategy markedly improve . According international guideline early start medical treatment , quick escalation dos , adjustment dose throughout whole disease course sign disease activity , consider important element RA treatment strategy . Consequently , success strategy implies possibility regular routine test RA patient , could become challenge health care system cause substandard treatment RA patient future . This call reorganization routine care RA , i.e . form telemedicine intervention . Telemedicine consider use communication information technology deliver clinical care individual involve location . No study yet investigate effect monitor disease activity standardize telemedicine treatment strategy patient RA , evidence derive study within chronic heart disease , chronic obstructive lung disease , asthma , diabetes hypertension . This evidence indicate , however , telemedicine intervention seem effective , time save associate high degree patient satisfaction . RA disease activity measure use composite score include objective subjective outcome parameter measure present well past disease activity . These score include : tender swollen joint count together patient 's global assessment , report physical functioning , measurement acute-phase reactant serial radiographic assessment . The commonly used instrument measure RA disease activity daily clinical practice European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) criterion , Disease Activity Score 28 ( DAS28 ) . However , telemedicine intervention direct physical contact patient health professional , make traditional disease activity measure unfit use , imply assessment tender swollen joint carry health professional . It suggest let patient examine joint . Still , show patient tend overestimate presence swollen joint impairs identification synovitis - thereby disease activity flare . Hence , telemedicine disease activity monitor RA may best support validated measure base kind patient self-assessment , i.e . newly develop `` Flare '' instrument . According international recommendation European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) patient access nurse-led telephone service enhance continuity care provide ongoing support , still remain unclarified occupational group , doctor nurse , carry routine telemedicine disease monitoring . The trend RA treatment towards patient take active role treatment , telemedicine could workable solution . However , decision make transform tight control disease activity among patient RA telemedicine intervention effectiveness intervention , execute doctor nurse , need investigate . The objective study : 1 . To test effectiveness customize telemedicine intervention target tight control disease activity among patient RA , compare usual outpatient care pragmatic randomize controlled trail . 2 . To test effect differs depend whether telemedicine consultation carry rheumatologist rheumatology nurse . 3 . To examine patient perspective towards telemedicine tight control disease activity RA , assess patient satisfaction acceptability towards intervention . Power calculation A decrease DAS28 1.2 regard significant clinically improvement . A change DAS28 0.6 regard non-response . Thus , change DAS28 score &gt; 0.6 used cut-point change condition . The standard deviation DAS28 presume 1.5 . Hence , order detect 1-sided statistically significant change three group , statistical power 80 % ( beta=0.20 ) , sample size least 98 patient group require . Intervention A systematic review literature conduct order make sure telemedicine management inform evidence . Further , focus group interview conduct among patient group among health professional , ensure intervention base expert consensus . The software use telemedicine intervention base establish generic Patient Reported Outcome ( PRO ) system , WestChronic , develop 2004 collection PRO data research purpose clinical epidemiological study . WestChronic support dynamic dual mode data collection web paper form well communication patient personalize postal letter , e-mail , text message . All information regard implementation , item questionnaire , communication , user , patient reside table Structured Query Language ( SQL ) database , administration implementation , questionnaire , user , patient support server software carry browser-windows . The software interphase serve dual purpose : ) customize communication tool patient health professional , b ) serve decision support health professional incorporation validate disease self-assessment tool . Decision support , Flare instrument The Flare instrument ( FI ) serve decision support assess disease activity RA telemedicine intervention . FI 12-item questionnaire patient ask express degree agreement different statement concern disease activity 10-point likert scale . Six item concern joint symptom ( tenderness , stiffness pain ) six item concern general symptom . When score FI possible compute FI total score ( 12 item ) subscale joint general symptom , respectively . The instrument translate Danish accord International Quality Life Asessment ( IQULA ) method . It validate cross sectional study among 100 consecutive patient outpatient clinic Department Rheumatology , Aarhus University Hospital , use DAS28 gold standard ( unpublished data ) . Execution After randomization patient allocate one three treatment arm : Telemedicine , doctor ( TD ) , Telemedicine , Nurse ( TN ) control week 0 , 13 , 26 , 39 52 . The telemedicine consultation base telephone consultation . The consultation follow predefined consultation checklist . Patients allocate TD TN , express desire complete questionnaire webform , receive letter week consultation remind must assess disease activity software interphase , within next couple day . Patients , express wish fill questionnaires paper form , receive questionnaire week consultation ask return WestChronic immediately completion . A chasing procedure carry case non-respondence . Two reminder send patient period four week continuous non-respondence hereafter lead exclusion study . During telephone consultation , updated clinical test result available electronic medical system . Acute consultation perform registered three group need . Statistics Comparisons group make Fisher exact test dichotomous response Mann-Whitney U test non-dichotomous response . Changes time analyze McNemar 's test dichotomous response Wilcoxon sign rank sum test non-dichotomous response . Data report mean ( SD ) variables normal distribution find ; otherwise data report median ( ( interquartile range ( IQR ) ) . Data analyze use `` intention treat '' per protocol . In case miss data multiple imputation use .</detailed_description>
