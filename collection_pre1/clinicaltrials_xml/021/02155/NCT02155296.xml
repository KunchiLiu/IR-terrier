	<brief_summary>The Restorative Practices Intervention ( RPI ) , whole school environment intervention integrate exist school practice ( rather 'added ' ) compete academic priority ; evidence support effectiveness improve school environment promote positive peer relationship . The specific aim investigator initiate study : 1 . Assess mechanisms RPI implementation influence school environment ; 2 . Assess effect RPI school staff perception school climate adolescent ' report school connectedness , peer relationship , developmental outcome ( academic achievement social competency ) problem behavior ( alcohol use , bullying , disciplinary referral ) ; 3 . Assess extent positive effect RPI adolescent persist time transition middle high school . For first time utilize rigorous scientific method , study potential document whether whole-school intervention like RPI , integrate exist school practice , affect developmental outcome problem behavior whether effect persist transition middle high school .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Young adolescence critical time development . Middle school youth ( age 11-14 ) experience biological , social , psychological , cognitive change expose variety risk factor mediate home school environment adult peer relationship . It time positive growth development , also poor developmental outcome ( define limit social competency poor academic achievement ) problem behavior , include alcohol use , bullying , school disciplinary referral . Many program deliver school , unfortunately , focus specific negative behavior deficit , like poor communication decision make skill , label adolescent problem need fix without leverage strengths resiliency youth . While many prevention program effective reduce prevent negative behaviors—mostly short term—they tend improve key developmental outcomes.This part program usually deliver stand-alone curriculum inserted school day address whole environment school . Also , program compete time resource school priority meet academic standard . Transitions elementary middle middle high school , place adolescent even great risk engage problem behavior , underscore need program middle school year promote positive developmental outcome via program address whole school environment . Positive youth development ( PYD ) program contrast developed provide support , opportunity , positive challenge youth , improve developmental outcome leverage youth 's innate potential positive growth development ( e.g. , see article ) . Comprehensive PYD program ( C-PYDs ) address multiple dimension show influence youth development ( e.g. , peer , school environment ) . Thus , program show promise able mitigate negative behavior like alcohol use bullying , promote developmental outcome social competency academic achievement . One C-PYD , Restorative Practices Intervention ( RPI ) , show particular promise two-year , whole school environment intervention integrate exist school practice ( rather 'added ' ) compete academic priority ; ground strong theoretical basis ( psychology affect theory ecological system theory ) ; quasi-experimental evidence support effectiveness improve school environment promote positive peer relationship . Despite evidence , question remain exact mechanisms result achieve whether result persist . Thus , rigorous research need assess RPI 's impact academic achievement , social competency , problem behavior ; underlie program mechanism achieve positive outcome across area . To improve science C-PYD evaluation , goal 5-year study conduct longitudinal randomize control trial RPI 16 school assess whether impact youth problem behavior AND developmental outcome . The study would conduct PA-08-241 : Reducing Risk Behaviors Promoting Positive Youth Development . The specific aim investigator initiate R01 : 1 . Assess mechanisms RPI implementation influence school environment ; 2 . Assess effect RPI school staff perception school climate adolescent ' report school connectedness , peer relationship , developmental outcome ( academic achievement social competency ) problem behavior ( alcohol use , bullying , disciplinary referral ) ; 3 . Assess extent positive effect RPI adolescent persist time transition middle high school . For first time utilize rigorous scientific method , study potential document whether C-PYD like RPI , integrate exist school practice , affect developmental outcome problem behavior whether effect persist transition middle high school . This information critical state cut funding implement typical , stand-alone prevention program limit amount time spend non-academic prevention program . This study determine whether efficiency gain implement C-PYD program potential influence multiple outcome area influence adolescent ' developmental trajectory . As , study propose impact on-going debate maximize federal/state resource devote middle school programming , minimize competition in-school prevention program usually face academic offering . Findings also potential advance theory PYD empirically validate first time restorative principle base psychology affect theory apply approach promote PYD target school environment .</detailed_description>
