	<brief_summary>TITLE : A Multicenter , Prospective , Observational Trial Prognostic Dynamic Change CTC Enumeration Advanced NSCLC 1st 2nd line chemotherapy target therapy BACKGROUND : Circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) identification new field research oncology , study conduct success breast prostate cancer . Nearly 80 % lung cancer diagnose advanced stage ( IIIB , IV ) . CTC identification monitor cell treatment could help clinician detect relapse prognostic factor . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To study relationship CTC count clinical outcome treatment ( Overall response rate Progression-free survival ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : To study relationship CTC overall survival . STUDY DESIGN : This prospective , observational study . Duration inclusion : 12months . SAMPLE SIZE : 1200 patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prognostic Dynamic Change CTC Enumeration Advanced NSCLC With Chemotherapy Targeted Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective observational non-intervention study evaluate dynamic CTC count chemotherapy targeted-therapy . Patients provide write informed consent pas screening . Peripheral blood drawn treatment . Relationship CTC count clinical outcome analyse . The time point blood draw set following : patient receive chemotherapy , prior 1st cycle chemotherapy , 3 day prior 2nd cycle chemotherapy , posterior 3th cycle ( less 4th cycle ) chemotherapy progressive disease ( PD ) ; patient receive targeted-therapy , prior treatment , 1 month treatment , PD . The clinical outcome treatment ultimately obtain .</detailed_description>
