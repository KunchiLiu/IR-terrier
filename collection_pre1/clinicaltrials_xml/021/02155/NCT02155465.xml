	<criteria>Pathologic evidence advance ( nonoperable metastatic ) biopsyproven stage IV recurrent lung cancer review MSKCC . document somatic activate mutation EGFR ( include limit Exon 19 deletion L858R ) Radiographic progression treatment erlotinib . Prior chemotherapy regimen permit . Received erlotinib EGFR TK treatment least 2 week prior enrollment Measurable ( RECIST 1.1 ) indicator lesion previously irradiate Must undergone biopsy development acquire resistance erlotinib ( perform standard care ) adequate tissue determine EGFR T790M tumor histology . Slides outside institution may use . KPS ≥ 70 % Age &gt; 18 year old Patients must adequate organ function : AST , ALT , Alk phos ≤ 3.0 x ULN Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN Creatinine &lt; 2.0 X upper limit normal and/or creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,000 cells/mm³ . Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL . Concurrent therapy potent CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor . Subjects may enter screen therapy potent inhibitor inducer complete may begin study treatment 1 week 5 halflives , whichever longer . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis require escalate dos steroid . Any type systemic therapy ( chemotherapy experimental drug ) within 3 week start treatment protocol except erlotinib EGFR TKI . Any radiation within 2 week prior start treatment protocol Patients ≥ grade 2 great diarrhea despite maximal medical management due medication medical condition Crohn 's disease , malabsorption . Inadequate recovery toxicity relate prior treatment ( Grade 1 baseline ) . Pregnant lactating woman Patients receive prior treatment JAK inhibitor Previously current malignancy sit within last 2 year , exception adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , prostate cancer require active treatment per National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline , superficial bladder cancer noninvasive indolent stage 1 malignancy without sponsor approval . Clinically significant cardiac disease include unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction within 6 month Day 1 study drug administration , New York Heart Association Class III IV congestive heart failure , symptomatic arrythmias require therapy , Chronic current active infection require systemic antibiotic , antifungal antiviral therapy . Known human immunodeficiency virus infection , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) viremia hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) viremia . Screening study require assessment infection already know . Any condition , opinion Investigator , may compromise safety , compliance patient , would preclude patient successful completion study .</criteria>
