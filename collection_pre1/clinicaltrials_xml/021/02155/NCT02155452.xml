	<brief_title>Fluorescence Glioma Heterogeneity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma commonest malignant brain tumor extremely challenge treat . Neuro-oncology see little progress treatment despite extensive research . Extent resection remain important prognostic factor tumor . Better resection , good outcome . However resect tumor easy primarily due infiltrative nature difficulty discern tumor boundary intraoperatively . Fluorescence guide resection ( FGR ) recently show important useful adjunct maximize goal . FGR involve administration aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) patient prior surgery . The ALA convert protoporphyrin IX ( PPIX ) glioma cell . The PPIX fluorophore visualize intraoperatively use suitably modify microscope . Neurosurgeons resect tumor radically guide fluorescence superior conventional microscopic resection . Selective PPIX accumulation glioma cell key accuracy technique . The biological basis selectivity PPIX accumulation within glioma cell however poorly understood . Various mechanism could involve start variable transport ( related blood-brain barrier property ) , differential uptake ( govern active transport mechanism ) differential metabolism within cell . Understanding mechanisms lead refinement strategy , overcome present limitation development method extend scope .</detailed_description>
