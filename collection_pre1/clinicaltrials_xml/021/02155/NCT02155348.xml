	<brief_summary>More patient like achieve complete spectacle independence cataract surgery . Two possibility particularly often use today one hand multifocal lens , hand concept monovision ( one eye adjust closeness focus distance ) . The drawback multifocal lenses patient bother glare phenomenon , disadvantage monovision patient lose little stereo vision . The aim study direct comparison two method . Therefore 70 patient include 2 group . In one group , patient receive side multifocal IOL near addition +1.5 D patient second group receive monovision . One hour , 1 week 3 month surgery , patient invite test visual accuity perform near vision ( 40cm ) , intermediate vision ( 80cm ) distant vision ( 400cm ) . Furthermore , contrast sensitivity stereopsis patient assesed . Additional measurement detect tilt lens perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spectacle independence central aim modern cataract surgery . Although bilateral monofocal IOL implantation , aim emmetropia low myopia , lead high level patient satisfaction distance vision , spectacle dependence reading near vision task usual result . The current technique available surgeon reduce spectacle dependence use bilateral multifocal IOLs . However , variable number patient complain problem glare , haloes light especially hour darkness ( dysphotopsia symptom ) . Dysphotopsia symptom may vary significantly patient patient . The real incidence dysphotopsia like symptom cataract surgery multifocal IOL unknown 6 implantation multifocal IOLs commonly accept contraindication patient night driver . Another option allow spectacle independence monovision . Monovision one eye see clearly distance eye intentionally make short-sighted either near read vision ( full monovision ) intermediate ( arm length ) distance vision ( limited monovision ) . Monovision two major advantage , little dysphotopsia cheap compare multifocal IOLs . However , disadvantage reduce stereopsis need neuroadaptation . The rationale trial compare bilateral multifocal intraocular lens ( MIOLs ) monovision cataract surgery concern visual function spectacle independence .</detailed_description>
