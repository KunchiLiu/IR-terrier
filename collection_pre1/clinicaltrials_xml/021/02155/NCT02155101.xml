	<brief_summary>The aim pilot study assess feasibility , efficacy safety Darunavir/ritonavir 800/100 mg daily ( DRV/r ) monotherapy switch-maintenance strategy patient receive second-line ART Yaoundé Central Hospital Cameroon . HIV-infected adult receive second-line antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) ≥3 month 2 nucleos ( ) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus either lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) atazanavir/ritonavir ( ATV/r ) undergo plasma HIV-1 RNA ( `` viral '' ) load test . Those viral load 50 copies/ml ( &lt; 50 cps/ml ) undergo repeat test ideally 4-6 week later ( allow 12 week ) ; viral load confirm &lt; 50 cps/ml patient invite join randomise phase study . Patients ( n=150 ) randomise 1:2 either continue current triple ART regimen ( n=50 ) switch DRV/r monotherapy ( n=100 ) . The primary end-point viral load suppression &lt; 400 cps/ml week 24 ; secondary end-points viral load suppression &lt; 50 cps/ml week 12 week 24 , safety , tolerability , emergence protease inhibitor ( PI ) drug-resistance . Patients continue observational follow-up depend treatment arm randomize . After week 48 , patient return local standard care . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacogenomics sub-study correlate plasma concentration DRV outcome , HIV-1 drug resistance test sub study detect mutant archive time first-line ART failure measure HIV DNA load perform , well cost-effectiveness analysis test hypothesis saving achieve switch DRV/r monotherapy without affect quality care . The primary virological objective evaluate efficacy term percentage subject plasma HIV-1 RNA level &lt; 400 cps/ml 24 week follow-up follow switch DRV/r monotherapy versus continue triple therapy contain 2 NRTIs + LPV/r ( ATV/r ) ( FDA Snapshot method ) . Study hypothesis : propose maintenance therapy DRV/r monotherapy feasible , effective safe treatment option patient receive second-line ART Yaoundé .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects document HIV1 infection . 2 . Male female age &gt; 21 year old . 3 . Subjects receive ART 2 NRTIs + LPV/r ( ATV/r ) least 3 month time Screening 1 . 4 . Nadir T lymphocyte cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) &gt; 100 cells/mm3 5 . Plasma HIV1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml Screening 1 confirm ideally 46 week later Screening 2 ( two result must document ; first result obtain 12 week earlier accept ) . 6 . Subjects comply protocol requirement . In particular , subject willing follow least week 24 ( discontinuation prior week 24 ) DRV/r arm week 48 ( discontinuation week 24 ) even discontinue randomize treatment . 7 . Subjects voluntarily sign dated consent form . 1 . Clinical laboratory evidence significantly decrease hepatic function decompensation , irrespective liver enzyme level ( liver insufficiency ) . 2 . Coinfection hepatitis B ( HBsAg positive ) . 3 . Grade 3 4 laboratory abnormality define AIDS , include haemoglobin ≤8mg/dL ; platelet ≤50 000/mm3 ; estimate creatinine clearance ≤60ml/ minute , aspartate aminotransferase ; alanine aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ; total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal ; follow exception unless clinical assessment foresees immediate health risk subject : Preexisting diabetes asymptomatic glucose grade 3 4 elevation . Asymptomatic triglyceride cholesterol elevation grade 3 4 . 4 . Presence currently active AIDS defining illness ( Category C condition accord Centers Disease Control Classification System HIV Infection 1993 ) follow exception : Stable cutaneous Kaposi 's Sarcoma ( i.e. , internal organ involvement oral lesion ) unlikely require form systemic therapy study . Wasting syndrome due HIV infection . Note : An AIDS defining illness clinically stabilize least 30 day consider currently active . 5 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 6 . Active substance abuse , include alcohol recreational drug . 7 . Any clinically significant disease ( e.g. , tuberculosis , cardiac dysfunction , pancreatitis , acute viral infection ) life threaten disease previous 14 day , finding screen medical history physical examination , investigator 's opinion , would compromise subject 's safety outcome study . 8 . Any medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator , could compromise subject 's safety adherence trial protocol . 9 . Previously demonstrate clinically allergy hypersensitivity excipients investigational medication ( DRV ) . Note : DRV sulfonamide . Subjects previously experience sulfonamide allergy allow enter trial . To date , potential cross sensitivity drug sulfonamide class DRV identify subject participate phase II trial . 10 . Participation clinical trial involve administration antiretrovirals drug within last 4 week participation trial .</criteria>
