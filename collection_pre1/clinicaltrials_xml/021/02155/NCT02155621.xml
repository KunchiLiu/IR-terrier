	<detailed_description>Carcinogenesis immensely complex process even within histologic cancer subtype - example adenocarcinoma lung breast - significant variability cancer behaviour response therapy . Analyses individual patient demonstrate unique molecular signature every cancer examine . Frequently , multiple different pathway involve disease growth progression dominant process varies person person perhaps even within different site disease within one person . As well variation evolve response treatment . Recognizing genetic aberration promote disease facilitates target treatment ; demonstrate several small subgroup cancer specific genetic mutation translocation successfully treat targeted chemotherapy agent . With many recognize mutation aberration , personalize evaluation genetic signature encode DNA RNA may provide important diagnostic information potentially enable directed therapy appropriate oncologic pathway thereby provide information help guide chemotherapy choice Our initial pilot project demonstrate feasibility approach institution ( 100 patient ) . We know possible identify consent patient , sequence genome transcriptome , analyze report abnormality , identify potential actionable target clinically relevant time frame . The overarch theme POG Program create comprehensive cataloguing somatic cancer mutation cellular pathway abnormality could generate profound insight genetic pattern underlie particular cancer phenotype , provide valuable prognostic predictive information . Eligible subject several sample analyze : fresh tumour biopsy ( typically 5 core require ) , blood sample normal comparison archival tumour available . Comprehensive DNA RNA sequence perform follow in-depth bioinformatic analysis identify somatic mutation , gene expression change abnormality might cancer `` driver '' provide actionable ( diagnostic ) druggable target . The POG team meet every week discus detailed genomic report patient , consider additional validation test necessary , debate research question . The clinician ( typically 5 - 10 ) come consensus systemic therapy might appropriate base result . Whenever possible subject match clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis cancer ; available metastatic cancer virtually certain clinical radiographic presentation POG program biopsy could do concurrently diagnostic biopsy minimize invasive testing patient . If biopsy turn cancer POG analysis may cancel . 2 . This cancer must incurable , define treat oncologist ( generally due advanced stage ) . 3 . Patients must agree provide archival tissue agree undergo least one study specific biopsy baseline blood test genomic analysis . All subject also biopsy blood sample progression could do safely . 4 . ECOG PS 0 1 . 5 . Patients may previously receive one line palliative systemic therapy and/or palliative radiation therapy need . In addition , hormone therapy one line biologically target therapy ( EGFR inhibitor , BRAF inhibitor , VEGF inhibitor ) permit would count line therapy . Such patient could one line systemic therapy one line hormone target therapy still potentially eligible . If target therapy give concurrently systemic chemotherapy would count one line treatment . 6 . Age &gt; 18 year age . 7 . Patient consent must obtain accord BCCA requirement . 8 . Patients must accessible followup must register BCCA . The intention program serve population B.C . open patient currently live receive treatment BC . The ability track subsequent treatment outcomes essential . 9 . Estimated life expectancy &gt; 6 month . 1 . Unable unwilling undergo tumour biopsy ( ) and/or blood/skin sample normal DNA . 2 . Significant medical condition opinion treat consent oncologist render subject suitable participation . 3 . Unwilling unable provide treatment outcome follow information BCCA investigator . 4 . Patients currently live receive treatment BC .</criteria>
