	<brief_title>Common Bile Duct Stone Management : What Have Learned ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence gallstone disease increase age , many one third woman one fifth men age 60 year gallstone . The quoted prevalence CBDS patient symptomatic gallstone varies , probably lie 10 20 % . In Europe Northern America 8 20 % case cholelithiasis complicate presence common bile duct stone ( CBDS ) cholecystectomy . When ductal stone become symptomatic consequence often serious include pain , partial complete biliary obstruction , cholangitis , hepatic abscess pancreatitis . Recent guideline treatment CBDS recommend patient symptoms clinical evaluation suggest ductal stone cause , stone extract possible , except select patient contraindication ( e.g high risk patient , refusal endoscopic operative treatment ) . Many different approach currently use management bile duct calculus . These strategy differ considerably term technical complexity , sensitivity , specificity , effectiveness , cost . Where initial assessment suggest high probability CBDS , reasonable proceed directly ERCP consider treatment choice . Intraoperative cholangiography selective intraoperative postoperative ERCP strategy routine preoperative ERCP , unless presence common bile duct stone ( CBD ) almost certain . Current data suggest clear superiority one approach regard success , mortality , morbidity cost-effectiveness . In unfit elderly people comorbid disease leave gallbladder situ justify ERCP treatment . Cholangitis present elderly people . Leaving gallbladder situ reduce morbidity rate ERCP CBDS , especially patient cholangitis All 101 patient symptomatic suspect CBD stone admit Surgical Department `` Ospedale Regionale di Mendrisio '' january 2006 december 2013 evaluate retrospectively study eligibility . Patients follow duration hospital stay , median hospital stay 9 day . From Hospital informatic system , information age , sex , length hospital stay , procedures undertaken hospital admission patient biliary diagnosis retrieve . Initial patient evaluation consist history physical examination serum analysis inflammatory parameter , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , transaminase , amylase . Previous history jaundice acute pancreatitis record . In addition , right upper quadrant abdominal sonogram CT scan obtain determination cholelithiasis CBD diameter . The diagnosis cholangitis base presence clinical evidence infection patient biliary obstruction form jaundice hyperbilirubinemia . In institution , patient cholelithiasis , CBD stone US examination , liver enzyme elevation , without clinical evidence cholecystitis biliary pancreatitis underwent ERCP , endoscopic sphincterotomy , endoscopic clearance CBD stone laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) . In patient acute cholangitis , dilate common bile duct US , first treatment also ERCP . Patients cholelithiasis , CBD intrahepatic bile duct ( IHBD ) dilatation , liver enzyme elevation , presence cholecystitis , biliary pancreatitis , apparent resolve symptomatic choledocholithiasis underwent evaluation magnetic resonance imaging ( MR ) , patient underwent therapeutic ERCP choledocholithiasis demonstrate MR , whereas patient whose MR detect choledocholithiasis underwent LC intraoperative cholangiography ( IOC ) . When find CBD LC , ERCP perform operating time ( `` rendez-vous '' ) post operatively . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) papillotomy perform patient confirmed common bile duct stone ( CBDS ) single gastroenterologist . In Hospital , procedure perform radiological room contain x-ray equipment . We use Olympus® duodenalendoscope TJF-145 ERCP , Erbe® system papillotomy diathermy , Lithotriptor® stone crush necessary . The patient prone position general anesthesia . When perform endoscopic stone extraction endoscopist support technician radiologist assist fluoroscopic screen additional endoscopy assistant/nurse manage guide wire . The relationship ERCP surgery assess divide patient 2 group : patient ERCP without cholecystectomy ( Group 1 ) , patient ERCP + cholecystectomy ( Group 2 ) . Endpoint detect difference age , indication ( cholangitis lithiasis ) , morbidity , effectiveness success CBD clearance different group .</detailed_description>
