	<brief_summary>The Ablative Solutions , Inc . Peregrine System Infusion Catheter catheter-based device intend used ablate afferent efferent sympathetic nerve serve kidney . The catheter typically inserted via femoral artery , steer renal artery , delivers , infusion distal end , neurolytic agent . This target nerve bundle , adventitia - sheath surround artery . The aim reduce blood pressure case resistant hypertension - seriously elevate blood pressure respond drug treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Peregrine Study : A Safety Performance Study Renal Denervation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong evidence publish literature renal nerve important contributor hypertension , ablation adverse side-effects . The literature provide technical , clinical scientific evidence support use perivascular renal denervation carefully define patient group . An exist device ( Ardian Symplicity catheter ) show safe effective achieve perivascular renal denervation delivery radiofrequency energy . Perivascular renal denervation radio-frequency energy delivery effective therapy , associate low risk . In context , denervation also safely effectively achieve neurolytic agent . The objective study evaluate safety performance renal denervation chemical neurolytic agent deliver advential/ periadventitial area renal artery purpose neurolysis , use Peregrine System Infusion Catheter , patient refractory hypertension . The ASI Peregrine System Infusion Catheter similar enough Ardian Symplicity catheter enable use publish data establish validity design concept Peregrine System estimate likely level risk side effect . It conclude literature ASI Peregrine System achieve percutaneous renal denervation low risk procedural complication ( comparable accept percutaneous interventional therapy ) without long-term impairment renal artery kidney function serious adverse event . Chemical denervation appropriate treatment specify study population adult resistant hypertension despite take least 3 anti-hypertensive drug different class include least one diuretic . In order study valid , one chemical neurolytic agent use . The Coordinating Investigator chosen use dehydrate alcohol ( 96 - 98 % volume ) therapeutic neurolysis , therefore participate site use agent . This clinical investigation intend provide clinical data demonstrates safety performance ASI Peregrine System Infusion Catheter .</detailed_description>
