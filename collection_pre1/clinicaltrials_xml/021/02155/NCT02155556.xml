	<detailed_description>Higher patient expectation concern unaided visual acuity cataract surgery lead increase use toric intraocular lens ( toric IOLs ) correction corneal astigmatism . Although show toric IOLs significantly reduce astigmatism , still difficulty predict remain astigmatism correctly . The main source error appear pre-operative measurement cornea . However , questionable , error derive measurement error due imprecise measurement technique , natural diurnal change cornea . Additionally , measurement cornea pose several challenge : different corneal biometry device use interchangeably difficult decide , device measure cornea correctly gold standard . Especially , eye small corneal astigmatism error increase . Recently show astigmatism meridian median 9° cornea 1.0D astigmatism 4° cornea 2.0D astigmatism . Similar finding observe Shammas et al . Norrby furthermore show 5 % corneas show 0.5D fluctuation measurement different ( post-operative ) time-points . The reason explore , diurnal change , temperature humidity potentially influence tear film , well pupil size asphericity cornea could play role . Read Collins observe diurnal change corneal radius within 24 hour , study young healthy volunteer include one measurement device ( Scheimpflug imaging , Pentacam HR ) use . Lau Pye Shen et al . measure diurnal change cornea , data concern corneal radius report . Harper et al . observe diurnal change central corneal thickness . However , none study investigate diurnal change corneal radii elderly population . Aim study gain well understanding diurnal change cornea improve toric IOL power calculation .</detailed_description>
