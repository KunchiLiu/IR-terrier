	<brief_summary>In Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( CE-MRA ) contrast agent inject arm vein use programmable medical device call power injector . Once contrast circulate blood vessel interest image MRI distinctly separate surround non-vascular tissue . This project design find best way administer contrast agent CE-MRA produce best image . The clinical availability programmable power injector facilitate use variable contrast rate volume injection protocol base patient specific parameter . CE-MRA valuable image tool diagnose abnormality major blood vessel chest abdomen . It often use conjunction cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) examination evaluate blood vessel heart lung . CE-MRA attractive 1 ) involve radiation , 2 ) contrast agent use toxic kidney use patient great risk kidney dysfunction follow iodinate contrast agent . We plan administer small ( 1cc ) test amount contrast , take picture contrast pass blood vessel , analyze result . Using information , administer individually patient-tailored injection give multiple phase ( i.e. , `` multi-phasic '' injection ) maintain constant contrast concentration ( therefore constant signal intensity ) throughout scan . We believe reduce image blurring , improve sharpness likely diagnostic quality CE-MRA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Concentration MR Contrast Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project build validate tool design optimize use magnetic resonance ( MR ) contrast agent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography ( CE-MRA ) . As angiography method , contrast agent selectively highlight patient 's artery compare surround tissue . In CE-MRA contrast agent inject arm vein use programmable injector transport body 's circulation arteries interest , point MR acquisition depict artery distinctly surround soft tissue . At present , clinically accept method inject contrast agent essentially every patient , systematically evaluate optimize . For chest abdominal CE-MRA study contrast injected 5-15 second , resultant concentration contrast agent artery duration MR acquisition well know . What concentration varies time , however , large impact quality clarity result image . This project design optimize concentration contrast agent artery MR scan use predictive result small `` test bolus '' injection tailor actual contrast injection individual patient concentration remain high constant possible time MR acquisition . This accomplished develop algorithms software tool tailor optimal , patient-specific injection parameter . The method validate preliminary clinical study . We propose predict contrast bolus look like ( i.e. , `` concentration vs. time '' ) first administer small ( 1cc ) test bolus , take picture contrast pass blood vessel , analyze result . Using information , believe individually patient-tailored injection give multiple phase ( i.e. , `` multi-phasic '' injection ) create constant contrast concentration ( therefore constant signal intensity ) throughout scan , eliminate source image blurring , improve sharpness likely diagnostic quality first-pass CE-MRA . Moreover , tailor contrast duration scan , contrast agent use efficiently waste outside acquisition duration , potentially recoup contrast-to-noise ratio ( CNR ) loss . It important note result study generalizable CT Angiography ( CTA ) well , similar efficient use contrast reduce cost excessive patient exposure iodinate contrast . We plan compare `` optimized '' multiphasic contrast administration standard single phase contrast administration .</detailed_description>
