	<brief_summary>Since people start take HIV medication , illness AIDS decrease , serious disease like heart disease , cancer , kidney , liver disease increase . HIV cause inflammation ( irritation ) inside body felt measured blood . Inflammation lead diseases become leading cause death people HIV . HIV therapy partially low level inflammation measure blood , however , level inflammation people HIV may remain high compare people infected HIV . Aspirin drug commonly use pain relief also approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) prevent heart attack stroke increase risk heart attack stroke . Aspirin also use ( approved FDA ) decrease risk cancer people increase risk . Aspirin think decrease risk heart attack stroke block activation platelet prevents blood clot clog narrow blood vessel , disease call atherosclerosis . It unknown aspirin might decrease chance develop cancer people high risk , aspirin show modulate ( change ) immune system . In HIV-infected people take antiretroviral therapy undetectable HIV viral load recently show low-dose aspirin 81 mg ( baby aspirin ) , give one week , lower platelet activation reduces blood marker inflammation may improve function immune system . The purpose study evaluate whether aspirin improve inflammation immune activation compare placebo ( inactive medication like dummy pill ) determine 12 week aspirin 300 mg aspirin 100 mg safe HIV-infected person antiretroviral therapy . Additionally , study whether high dose long duration aspirin provide anti-inflammatory immune-modulating benefit . This do use blood urine test measure inflammation also test us ultrasound measure flow blood arm , call flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) brachial artery ( BART ) . This painless test bounce sound wave blood vessel arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modulation Immune Activation Aspirin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled 3-arm clinical trial study whether aspirin improves inflammation immune activation . At study entry , participant randomize three study arm : aspirin 300 mg , aspirin 100 mg placebo . The study treatment duration 12 week , follow 4 week washout period . The study duration 16 week . The study clinic visit include pre-entry ( within 7 day prior entry ) , entry , treatment visit week 2 , 11 12 , final study visit end wash-out period week 16 . The sample primary secondary outcome collect pre-entry , entry , week 2 , 11 12 . The evaluation safety ( clinical assessment sign symptom , diagnosis , laboratory test ) do entry week 2 , 11 , 12 16 . The co-primary objective use pair-wise comparison assess effect 300 mg 100 mg daily aspirin 12 week plasma sCD14 level . Currently , result enter primary outcome measure . The result secondary outcomes post become available</detailed_description>
