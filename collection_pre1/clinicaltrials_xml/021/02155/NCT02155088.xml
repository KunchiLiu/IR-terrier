	<criteria>Patient able swallow retain oral medication Histologically document diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 Required baseline laboratory status accord protocol document Prior sensitivity intolerance PI3K inhibitor Potential participant central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement may participate patient : &gt; /= 4 week prior therapy completion ( include radiation and/or surgery ) start study treatment ; Clinically stable respect CNS tumor time screen ; Not receive steroid therapy . Prior treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment pancreatic cancer except adjuvant therapy . Should receive gemcitabine within 6 month start study treatment . 5Fluorouracil radiation treatment receive 4 week prior receive study drug . Potential participant receive radiotherapy ≤ 4 week prior start study drug , exception palliative radiotherapy , recover side effect therapy baseline Grade ≤ 1 and/or ≥ 30 % bone marrow irradiate . Potential participant undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment recover side effect procedure . Have receive investigation agent within 30 day prior enrollment Clinically significant cardiac disease impair cardiac function QT interval adjust accord Fredericia ( QTcF ) &gt; 480 msec screen ECG Potential participant diabetes mellitus require insulin treatment and/or clinical sign fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) &gt; 140 mg/dL history document steroidinduced diabetes mellitus . Any condition would , Investigator 's judgment , preclude participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure , e.g . infection/inflammation , intestinal obstruction , unable swallow oral medication , social/psychological complication . Impaired GI function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral BYL719 ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Liver disease cirrhosis , decompensated liver disease , chronic hepatitis ( i.e . quantifiable hepatitis B virus [ HBV ] DNA and/or positive HbsAg , quantifiable hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] RNA ) . Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Known severely impair lung function ( spirometry diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide [ DLCO ] 50 % less normal O2 saturation 88 % less rest room air ) . Currently receive warfarin coumarin derive anticoagulant , treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , fondaparinux allow Currently receive treatment drug know strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A . Must discontinue strong inducer least one week must discontinue strong inhibitor start treatment . Switching different medication prior start study treatment allow . Has history noncompliance medical regimen inability grant consent Currently receive medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug treatment History another malignancy require active treatment within 2 year prior start study treatment , except cure basal cell carcinoma skin excise carcinoma situ cervix .
