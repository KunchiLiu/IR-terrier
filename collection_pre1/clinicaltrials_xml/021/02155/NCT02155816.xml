	<detailed_description>Background Information Scientific Rationale Consumption long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n-3 PUFAs ) , include eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ; 20:5n-3 ) , docosapentaenoic acid ( DPA ; 22:5n-3 ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ; 22:6n-3 ) fish fish-oil supplement reduce disease risk factor , counter component metabolic syndrome include inflammation high triglyceride , stabilizes heart cell , prevents blood clot form , decrease all-cause mortality , cardiac sudden death , possibly stroke ( Circulation 2006 ; 114:82-96 ) . The health benefit n3-PUFAs prompt U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) support qualify health claim status EPA DHA . Estimates ratio omega-6 ( n-6 ) linoleic acid ( LA ) omega-3 ( n-3 ) α-linolenic acid ( ALA ; 18:3n-3 ) , ALA increase 6.4 10.0 20th century , result decrease tissue concentration EPA DHA ( Am J Clin Nutr 2011 ; 93:950-962 ) . Recommendations EPA DHA intake vary , general , organization recommend range 300 1,000 mg/day fatty fish supplement ( Circulation 2006 ; 114:82-96 ) . The FDA recommend consumer exceed 3,000 mg/day EPA DHA , 2,000 mg/day dietary supplement . The persistent increase inflammation biomarkers define chronic systemic inflammation , link multiple disorder disease include atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) , diabetes mellitus ( Circulation 2003 ; 107:499-511 ) . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) frequently measure inflammatory biomarker , individual CRP value upper tertile adult population ( &gt; 3.0 mg/L ) 2-fold increase CVD risk compare CRP concentration 1.0 mg/L ( Curr Atheroscler Rep 2010 ; 12:110-8 ) . An elevated fasting IL-6 concentration significant component chronic low-grade inflammation ( Metabolism 2007 ; 56:332-8 ) . Epidemiological study suggest inverse relationship CRP diet rich marine product ( Am J Clin Nutr 2006 ; 84:223-9 ) . At sufficiently high intake , n-3 PUFAs may decrease production inflammatory eicosanoids cytokine ( Mol Nutr Food Res 2008 ; 52:885-97 ) . The majority intervention study adults feature MetS report benefit inflammatory measure , study use high n-3 fatty acid dos long supplementation period report effect ( review , see Lipids 2013 ; 48:319-32 ) . A pre-existing inflammatory state poor n-3 PUFA status may require see benefit n-3 PUFAs systemic inflammation . Palmitoleic acid ( C16:1 n-7 ) omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid find macadamia nuts seed variety plant include cat 's claw , sea buckthorn , milk weed ( Prog Lipid Res 2012 ; 51:340-9 ) . Macadamia nuts practical source palmitoleic acid ( 30 % ) . The nutritional biological function palmitoleic acid complex scientific understand biological significance human health limit ( J Lipid Res 2011 ; 52:808-12 ; Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care . 2013 ; 16:225-31 ) . Palmitoleate may increase cell membrane fluidity , attenuate insulin resistance , reduce inflammation associate diabetes heart disease ( review , see Prog Lipid Res 2012 ; 51:340-9 ) . Several human study indicate supplementation and/or inclusion macadamia nut cholesterol-lowering diet significantly reduce LDL-C concentration ( 4.0-10.7 % ) triglyceride concentration ( 9.0-20.9 % ) ( see J Nutr 2008 ; 138:761-7 ; Arch Intern Med 2000 ; 160:1154-8 ) . One human study 17 male hypercholesterolemia subject show supplementation macadamia nut period 4 week reduce plasma biomarkers inflammation oxidative stress ( Lipids 2007 ; 42:583-7 ) . Study Product ( A ) Placebo Placebo ( EEs ) - MCT ( medium chain triglyceride ) manufacture Natural Factors . All subject receive one softgel orally twice daily food . Study Product ( B ) : Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester , 2 soft gel total 1000mg ( 660mg EPA +340mg DHA ) /day EPA/DHA product manufacture Natural Factors . Each softgel Omega-3 contain 500 mg natural marine lipid concentrate ( 330 mg eicosapentaenoic acid [ EPA ] , 170 mg docosahexaenoic acid [ DHA ] ) . All subject receive one softgel orally twice daily food . Study Product ( C ) : Omega-3 fatty acid + Omega-7 fatty acid Cis-Palmitoleic acid , ethyl ester , 2 soft gel total 1000mg ( 660mg EPA +340mg DHA ) Omega-3 + 210mg Omega-7 fatty acid /day All subject receive one soft gel orally twice daily food . Potential Risks Benefits Potential Risks product All fatty acid find naturally whole food macadamia nut , fish , meat . The omega 3 supplement study exceed upper level recommend FDA ( 3,000 mg/day EPA DHA , 2,000 mg/day dietary supplement ) . For comparison , one 3-oz serve wild Atlantic salmon provide 1,500 mg EPA DHA , 3-oz serving can white tuna provide 700 mg . Fish oil supplementation establish history safe use nutritional supplement medical food . Palmitoleic acid monounsaturated fat macadamia nut . The purified omega 7 fat use study derive Peruvian anchovy , concentrate seven-step purification process 50 % palmitoleic acid . In unpublished randomized , double blind , placebo control study , omega 7 + 3 combination exert anti-inflammatory lipid modulating effect , well tolerate among participant adverse effect ( Dr. Andrew Swick , Metagenics , private communication , February 13 , 2014 ) . Potential Benefits Potential health benefit include improvement plasma lipoprotein reduction systemic inflammation omega 7 + 3 combination omega 3 fat . Study Objectives/Endpoints This single center , placebo control , double blind , 8 week , 3-arm randomize controlled trial conduct Appalachian State University Human Performance Laboratory North Carolina Research Campus Kannapolis , NC . All patient undergo informed consent process enrollment . This exploratory study generally healthy female subject obtain information pertain efficacy omega 7 + 3 combination improve systemic inflammation plasma lipoprotein compare omega 3 fat alone placebo . The primary Study Objectives/Endpoints : To explore effect 8-weeks supplementation omegas 7 3 fat combination versus omega-3 fat placebo systemic inflammation ( CRP cytokine panel ) . Secondary Study Objectives/Endpoints : To explore effect 8-weeks supplementation omegas 7 3 fat combination versus omega-3 fat placebo plasma lipoprotein .
