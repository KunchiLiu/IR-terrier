	<brief_summary>The purpose research study test whether researcher alter change expectation pain . The researcher test whether effect size pupil response thermal heat temperature subject osteoarthritis knee hip healthy subject comparison . One 3 possible treatment group administer qualify subject : ( 1 ) gabapentin , medication commonly use treat nerve pain , ( 2 ) modafinil , medication commonly use treat people narcolepsy ( disorder cause people fall asleep ) ( 3 ) placebo , inactive substance , like sugar pill , think effect disease condition</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose rationale study : Both chronic pain disability total knee replacement surgery predict negative cognitive-affective state , characterize depression , anxiety , cognitive style dominate catastrophizing . How negative state result chronic pain disability know , hypothesize cause dysfunction release neurotransmitter , norepinephrine several region brain , mid-brain , spinal cord important many process involve recovery surgery . Objectives : ( 1 ) Gabapentin modafinil increase rest pupil diameter moderate effect size patient osteoarthritis ; ( 2 ) Expectations modify pain experience moderate effect size patient Methods : 30 subject moderate average daily pain osteoarthritis knee hip healthy subject recruit come clinical research unit Wake Forest . Informed consent confirm complete questionnaire . We take verbal medical medication history obtain blood pressure heart rate measurement . Verbal pain intensity report ( 0-10 pain bad pain imaginable ) obtain 5 second heat stimulus , separate 30 second , deliver nonpainful area skin arm describe preliminary data . During pain testing , study subject sit comfortable chair low-ambient light room head position chin rest continuous record pupil diameter use near infrared recording system describe preliminary data . Pupil diameter probe temperature pass analog digital converter acquire 60 Hertz ( Hz ) subsequent analysis . Five sequence test stimulus present , brief break sequence . The first sequence consist 7 stimulus , 39⁰ 51⁰ Celsius ( C ) 2⁰C increment , ascend order . Data training sequence use analysis . Sequences 2 3 consist 5 , 5-second stimulus , present random order , generate moderate ( 50⁰C ) mild ( 47⁰C ) pain ( random condition ) . Sequences 4 5 also consist random presentation 5 stimulus temperature , different auditory tone 6 prior stimulus onset correctly cue stimulus temperature ( cue condition ) . Subjects randomize receive oral gabapentin , 900 milligram ( mg ) , modafinil , 200 mg , placebo , follow 2 hour later pain test pupillometry , consist different sequence . The random cue paradigms present twice follow sequence one miscue positive expectation pain direction ( signal 50⁰C deliver 47⁰C ) one negative expectation pain direction . Subjects provide verbal pain intensity score stimulus .</detailed_description>
