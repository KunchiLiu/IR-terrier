	<brief_summary>The purpose study see long lenalidomide therapy maintain improve disease response obtain induction therapy include lenalidomide , pomalidomide thalidomide ; consequently reduce worsen disease evaluate activity lenalidomide . Patients receive lenalidomide observation . All patient attend regular clinic visit evaluate disease health . Patients option participate additional biomarker correlative study addition participation main study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : Related initial diagnosis prior induction 1 . Previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma ( MM ) . 2 . MM diagnosis meeting 3 diagnostic criterion ( 1 ) monoclonal plasma cell bone marrow ≥ 10 % and/or presence biopsyproven , plasmacytoma , ( 2 ) monoclonal protein serum and/or urine , ( 3 ) least one criterion hypercalcemia , renal failure , anemia bone disease . 3 . Measurable disease protein electrophoresis analysis . 4 . All subject must treat minimum 6 cycle ( unless subject achieve complete response prior 6 cycle ) , maximum 12 cycle induction without lenalidomide ( LEN ) , pomalidomide ( POM ) thalidomide ( THAL ) . Subject must achieve least stable disease ( SD ) best overall response maintain SD well throughout induction screening . Subjects plateau must least 2 cycle best response prior randomization . 5 . Subjects must cytogenetic ( e.g . :17 p deletion , 4 ; 14 translocation ) , β2 microglobulin serum albumin ( ISS Stage ) result initial diagnosis available time screen . Related subject 6 . Must understand voluntarily sign informed consent document ( ICD ) prior conduct study related assessments/procedures , 7 . Age ≥ 65 year : &lt; 65 year age , subject must non eligible decline stem cell transplant , 8 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score ≤ 2 , 9 . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement , 10 . Females Childbearing Potential * ( FCBP ) must : 1 . Have two negative pregnancy test verify study doctor prior start study therapy . She must agree ongoing pregnancy test course study , end study therapy . This apply even subject practice true abstinence** heterosexual contact . 2 . Either commit true abstinence heterosexual contact ( must review monthly basis ) agree use , able comply , effective contraception without interruption , 28 day prior start investigational product ( IP ) , study therapy ( include dose interruption ) , 28 day discontinuation study therapy . 11 . Male Subjects must : 1 . Practice true abstinence** agree use condom sexual contact pregnant female FCBP participate study , dose interruption least 28 day follow IP discontinuation , even undergone successful vasectomy . 2 . Agree donate semen IP therapy 28 day end study therapy . 12 . All subject must : 1 . Have understand study medication could potential teratogenic risk . 2 . Agree abstain donate blood take IP therapy follow discontinuation IP therapy . 3 . Agree share study medication another person . 4 . All FCBP male subject must counsel pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . An FCBP sexually mature woman : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy 2 ) naturally postmenopausal ( ie , amenorrhea follow cancer therapy rule childbearing potential ) least 24 consecutive month ( ie , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . True abstinence acceptable line prefer usual lifestyle subject . [ Periodic abstinence ( et , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception ] . The presence follow exclude subject study enrollment : 1 . Previous treatment antimyeloma therapy require 612 cycle induction without LEN , POM THAL ( include local radiotherapy , bisphosphonates , single short course steroid [ ie , less equal equivalent dexamethasone 40 mg/day 4 day ; short course steroid treatment must give within 14 day randomization ] ) . 2 . Subjects achieve SD well get least 6 cycle induction eligible . 3 . Nonsecretary MM . 4 . Prior therapy LEN , POM , THAL Melphalan . Subjects received investigational agent also exclude . 5 . Any significant medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject participate study . 6 . Pregnant lactating female . 7 . Any following laboratory abnormality : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) &lt; 1,000/µL ( 1.0 x 109/L ) Untransfused platelet count &lt; 50,000 cells/µL ( 50 x 109/L ) Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) / serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) / serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SPGT ) &gt; 3.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 x ULN 8 . Severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance [ CrCl ] &lt; 30 mL/min CockcroftGault method ) actual CrCl result require hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis . 9 . Prior history malignancy include skin cancer , multiple myeloma , exception basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma situ . 10 . Prior history deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism within 3 year randomization . 11 . Subjects unable unwilling undergo antithrombotic therapy . 12 .
