	<brief_summary>Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging ( 3D MIRA ) new infrared imaging technology use Real Imager 8 ( RI8 ) develop Real Imaging . This technology generate 3D metabolic map breast base sophisticated machine learn technology , provide objective risk assessment presence malignant tumor breast . The procedure non-invasive , comfortable involve ionize radiation . It base acquire infrared image breast . Those image process analyzed computer provide objective risk assessment . The technology intend use screen tool breast cancer emerge highly useful woman screen mammography sub-optimal , woman dense breast . 3D MIRA unaffected breast density therefore ideal evaluate patient mammographically dense breast . The purpose clinical study assess ability novel technology detect breast cancer woman .</brief_summary>
