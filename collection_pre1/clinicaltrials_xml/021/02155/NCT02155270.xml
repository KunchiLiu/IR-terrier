	<brief_summary>We would like evaluate use 600μm pre-cut regard wound architecture surgically induce astigmatism compare stab-incision ( corneal incision without pre-cut ) . A dedicated wound architecture score use evaluate wound configuration . Postoperatively , OCT scan obtain , corneal curvature measure subjective objective refraction perform order measure surgically-induced astigmatism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Corneal Pre-cut Wound Architecture Astigmatism Cataract Surgery - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal wound architecture cataract surgery recently assessed1-4 use optical coherence tomography . However , none study observe effect wound architecture postoperative astigmatism . In previous study perform center , cataract surgery use 1.8 mm micro incision ( MICS ) compare 2.5 mm standard incision ( SICS ) regard wound architecture surgically induced astigmatism . Wound size wound architecture assess use Time-Domain OCT intraand postoperatively . After implantation IOL incision show large plan . This effect show pronounce small incision group . Both epithelial endothelial wound gap end surgery occur often MICS group . Furthermore , study show effect 300 μm pre-cut postoperative wound architecture surgically induced astigmatism . Based finding would like perform another study use high-resolution Spectral-Domain OCT , allow three-dimensional depiction wound architecture well understanding dynamic change wound structure surgery . Furthermore new high resolution OCT device available outside operate theatre postoperative measurement . Both device CE certify , use accord indication allow noncontact therefore pain free measurement . As significant impact 300μm pre-cut wound architecture astigmatism show predecessor study , would like evaluate use 600μm pre-cut regard wound architecture surgically induce astigmatism compare stab-incision ( corneal incision without pre-cut ) . A dedicated wound architecture score use evaluate wound configuration . Postoperatively , OCT scan obtain , corneal curvature measure subjective objective refraction perform order measure surgically-induced astigmatism .</detailed_description>
