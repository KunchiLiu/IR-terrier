	<brief_summary>Purpose 1 . To validate 2 -day loop recording ( R.Test Evolution 4 ) 2 -day Holter recording ( gold standard ) detection atrial fibrillation ≥ 30 second duration consecutive population patient stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) . 2 . To determine whether short run atrial fibrillation ( &lt; 30 ) presence many supraventricular extrasystole detect Holter recording , associate risk re-stroke consecutive population patient stroke TIA . 3 . To test whether 7-day Loop Recording ( R -test ) detect patient atrial fibrillation 2 day Holter record consecutive population patient stroke TIA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Project title : Detection atrial fibrillation patient recent stroke TIA : Validity automate loop-recording ( Rtest ) compare Holter record predictive value short run atrial fibrillation excess supraventricular extra systole new stroke Abstract : Stroke constitute major health problem nationally globally . Each year 15 million people worldwide attack stroke . In Denmark stroke hit 14.000 people year third lead cause death . In research project , examine heart rate 1,500 patient within 1 week blood clot brain ( ischemic stroke ) symptom blood clot brain , dwindle within 24 hour ( TIA ) . There clear international national guideline regard optimal way detect atrial fibrillation stroke TIA patient , though atrial fibrillation know increase fivefold risk stroke . Holter record two day electrocardiogram consider golden standard investigation heart rhythm disturbance offer Department Neurology Holstebro , recruit patient . Holter record resource-intensive procedure data analysis . Project patient mount 2- day Holter Rtest either 2 7 day . The Rtest loop recorder new device market continuously monitor opposite Holter recorder , automatically analyse heart rhythm . The validity Rtest regard detect atrial fibrillation compare Holter unknown clarify . Additionally use 2-day Holter recording test whether short-term rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation &lt; 30 second , and/or many extra heartbeat ( supraventricular extra systole ) increase risk stroke recurrence . Patients follow Danish Stroke Register . If increase risk find , gray area patient currently offer anticoagulant therapy , may prove treatment indication . If study show loop record replace Holter record mean economic gain . The study expect contribute substantial evidence future treatment stroke TIA patients.Stroke constitutes major health problem nationally globally .
