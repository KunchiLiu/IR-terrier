	<detailed_description>Five-year survival invasive epithelial ovarian cancer ( ovarian cancer ) less 50 % woman diagnose advanced stage . However , effective chemoprevention strategy . Meta-analysis epidemiological study show approximately 40 % reduction risk ovarian cancer 5 year oral contraceptive ( OC ) use . The protective effect increase significantly duration OC use continue least 25 year use OCs stop . The mechanism ( ) underlie protective effect understood . One hypothesis protection achieve block ovulation , grow evidence suggests may relate promote favorable progestagenic environment . OC use would protect hormonal exposure OCs le stimulatory possibly different type cell origin ovarian cancer hormonal exposure normal ovulatory cycle . Exposure progestins high OCs normal cycling could explain protective effect . We propose major source protection OC use due significantly reduce cell proliferation fallopian tube fimbria ( FTF ) ovarian cortical inclusion cyst ( CICs ) , two likely cell origin ovarian cancer . Proliferating cell population susceptible carcinogenic effect rise cancer risk cell proliferation secondary increase chance mutation progression . FTF proliferation report almost confine follicular phase menstrual cycle virtually proliferation within day ovulation preliminary data show pattern - OCs could thus protect ovarian cancer arise FTF mimic luteal phase cycle progesterone exposure high . Whether change occur CICs know . Cell proliferation within different type CICs menstrual cycle study . The effect OCs proliferation within FTF CICs also study . We propose determine effect 'traditional ' high progestin dose OC cell proliferation FTF CICs woman undergo risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( RR-BSO ) , compare proliferation rate rate normal menstrual cycle woman also undergo RR-BSO . The result study provide crucial information regard relationship OC use protection ovarian cancer . It lay foundation study examine effect low progestin dose OCs OCs new progestin formulation . Our long-term goal study mechanism OC protection determine whether likely protection ovarian cancer afford OCs lose alteration OC formulation term dose type progestin use , , possible , guide development OC formation improve protection afford OCs .</detailed_description>
