	<brief_title>Extravascular Lung Water Pulmonary Vascular Permeability After Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) occur incidence 12 % cardiac surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CBP ) . Using one-lung ventilation ( OLV ) addition , common practice minimally invasive cardiac surgery ( MICS ) , one hypothesize risk ARDS increase . The objective prospective , observational study measure extravascular lung water index ( EVLWI ) pulmonary vascular permeability index ( PVPI ) parameter lung edema alteration pulmonary permeability compare three group surgery patient : I ) patient CPB , II ) patient OLV III ) patient CPB OLV . MICS allow coronary artery bypass graft cardiac valve surgery small incision , appear inferior conventional surgery , likely reduces postoperative pain , accelerate postoperative recovery improve cosmetic result . However , base available data , respiratory failure MICS occur rate conventional cardiac surgery . In addition , unilateral re-expansion pulmonary edema , rarely see conventional cardiac surgery , describe MICS CPB OLV . The pathophysiology ARDS characterize massive inflammation lead diffuse damage alveolar epithelium pulmonary vascular endothelium . Although etiology ARDS multifactorial , uniform result acute , nonhydrostatic , high-permeability lung injury interstitial alveolar protein-rich edema , epithelial damage rapid onset pulmonary fibrosis . This lead vast reduction pulmonary gas exchange hypoxemia . Extravascular lung water ( EVLW ) comprise fluids extravascular compartment lung , ie , intracellular water , lymphatic fluid , surfactant extravasate plasma . Increased EVLW may cause increase hydrostatic intravascular pressure , occur cardiogenic pulmonary edema , and/or increase lung endothelial epithelial permeability , ARDS . The EVLWI estimate EVLW use transpulmonary thermodilution technique.The pulmonary vascular permeability index ( PVPI ) ratio EVLWI pulmonary blood volume , also measure transpulmonary thermodilution technique . The PVPI think reflect permeability alveolar-capillary barrier . The combination CPB OLV permit development MICS . CPB extracorporeal circulation , heart-lung machine take temporarily pump function heart oxygenation ventilation function lung , thereby , allow various heart vascular surgical procedure . During CPB , blood right side heart drain heart-lung machine return arterial system . This lead hypoperfusion lung , blood flow maintain bronchial artery . OLV allow surgeon access thorax cavity operation , contralateral lung ventilate . It originally think lung relatively resistant ischemia due dual circulation . However , re-perfusion lung CPB and/or OLV trigger fatal cascade , summarize lung ischemia reperfusion injury ( LIRI ) . LIRI involve intracellular injury pertinent inflammatory response , result apoptosis endothelium , alveolar capillary interstitial edema , hyaline membranization , infiltration neutrophil macrophage . In addition , CPB , contact blood component artificial surface bypass circuit contribute postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) . Through mechanism , lung compliance resistance well pulmonary permeability affect , contributes development ARDS . During OLV , combination LIRI well surgical trauma lung hyperinflation may lead release inflammatory mediator alter endovascular permeability . Additionally , thoracic surgery pulmonary vascular permeability increase re-expansion collapsed lung may result call re-expansion pulmonary edema . To best investigator knowledge , study primarily aim examine relationship MICS lung injury , although high clinical interest whether combination CPB OLV MICS lead increase EVLW pulmonary permeability ARDS .</detailed_description>
