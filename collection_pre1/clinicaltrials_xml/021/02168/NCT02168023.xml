	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection ( SSIs ) constitute important medical socioeconomic problem worldwide . Despite fact risk factor SSIs identify continuously increase medical knowledge field tissue engineering , molecular biology microbiology facilitate development numerous new recommendation method management , many case available option successful treatment post-operative wound infection remain limited . Non-treated inappropriately treated SSIs often lead necrosis surround tissue , wound dehiscence , formation fistula , become site origin systemic infection . Patients expose risk complication hospitalization time extend result increased total treatment cost . Treatment prolongation affect also quality life psychosocial functioning patient impair wound heal . Considering argument , appropriate prevention management infect post-surgical wound currently one priority majority invasive medical discipline . Obstetrics constitute field medicine issue associate wound heal particularly relevant . According literature data wound infection occur approximately 1.8-11.3 % woman undergo caesarean section . Dialkylcarbamoyl chloride ( DACC ) fatty acid derivative irreversibly bind microorganisms dress fibre result hydrophobic interaction . As mechanism DACC action solely physical chemical agent release wound bed dressing could safely used woman puerperal period . The purpose randomize control study compare effect DACC impregnate dress standard surgical dressing prevention SSIs adult woman follow caesarean section . This study also evaluate pre- , peri- postoperative risk factor SSIs analyze health economics DACC impregnate dressing prevention post-cesarean wound infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate DACC Dressings Prevention Surgical Site Infections Women Undergoing Caesarean Section .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-blinded randomized control trial perform Department Obstetrics Gynecology Medical University Warsaw . The study involve 518 patient undergoing caesarean section give informed consent randomly divide two group : study ( n=259 ) control group ( n=259 ) . The study group receive DACC impregnate dress - Sorbact Surgical Dressing ® ( ABIGO Medical AB , Sweden ) control group receive standard surgical dressing . In participant transverse skin incision low transverse uterine incision perform caesarean section procedure . All participant receive prophylactic dose antibiotic prior start surgery ( 1g cefazolin intravenously 0-30 minute surgery ) wound irrigation octenidine prior subcutaneous tissue closure . For fascial incision , subcutaneous tissue skin incision closure continuous antibacterial braid absorbable suture , single monofilament absorbable suture subcuticular continuous monofilament non-absorbable suture use , respectively . Dressing leave place first 48 hour post caesarean section unless clinical reason exist replace . After first 48 hour postoperatively dressing remove first wound evaluation perform . On post-operative day 3 patient discharge indicated revisit post-operative day 7 remove skin suture . During follow-up visit second wound review perform sign infection . Third , final wound assessment take place post-operative day 14 . To analyze overall treatment cost patient SSI follow end treatment , 8 week post surgery .</detailed_description>
