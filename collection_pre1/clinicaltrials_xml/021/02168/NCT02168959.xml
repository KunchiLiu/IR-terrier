	<brief_summary>The primary purpose propose study compare postoperative pain score total opioid consumption two group randomize either receive receive femoral nerve block pain control follow surgical repair tibial plateau fracture . Pain assessed post-operatively use standard numeric pain score rat 0 - 10 scale , well use University new pain assessment tool - Clinically Aligned Pain Assessment ( CAPA ) . This new 5 question pain assessment tool yet validate , address several key question , include patient comfort , pain control , change pain status , daily function , sleep quality . Along post-operative pain score , compare total opioid consumption two group . The null hypothesis difference pain score total opioid consumption patient receive femoral nerve block without nerve block follow surgical repair tibial plateau fracture . A secondary outcome examine long-term pain control , range motion , functional status patient regular orthopedic clinic follow-up appointment . The pain score assess , along quadriceps strength knee range motion . Patients complete PROMIS Physical Function CAT short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment , patient report outcomes tool evalute physical function . A teriary outcome retrospectively examine postoperative pain score total opioid consumption tibial plateau fracture patient see University Utah surgical repair past 10 year .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient , age 18 year old , present University Hospital surgical repair tibial plateau fracture consider inclusion prospective study . The diagnosis tibial plateau fracture decision proceed operating room surgery make attend surgeon orthopedic trauma service base expertise standard care . Male female patient , age 18 year old , underwent surgery perform Dr. Kubiak Dr. Higgins University Hospital repair tibial plateau fracture consider inclusion retrospective study . Prospective Study : Patients speak English Patients unable effectively communicate treatment team ( example : mechanically ventilate patient mentally handicap patient ) Patients less 18 year old Patients ongoing compartment syndrome Patients allergy intolerance bupivacaine Patients significant associate traumatic injury would expect delay overall recovery ( example : patient sustains motor vehicle accident fracture tibia also sustain massive intraabdominal injury serious damage liver vital organ ) Patients ipsilateral femoral fracture Retrospective : Patients le 18 year age</criteria>
