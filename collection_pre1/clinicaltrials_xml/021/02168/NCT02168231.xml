	<brief_summary>Incisional hernia frequently see long term complication surgery cause much morbidity even mortality patient . Despite study optimal closing technique laparotomy , risk incisional hernia midline incision remain 5-20 % . It establish implement mesh reduces recurrence incisional hernia still result repair often disappointing . Incisional hernia become increasingly complex due complicate abdominal wall defect cause disturbed anatomy , fistula , burst abdomen , wound mesh infection . In case save repair incisional hernia mean synthetic mesh augmentation tool need implement . In recent year use biological mesh gain popularity . Recent report use collagen-based prosthesis suggest support new vessel growth , excite significant foreign body reaction , form few adhesion , well incorporate host tissue minimal wound contraction , use grossly contaminated wound fewer infective complication . Biologic mesh harvest source tissue process medical use vary widely process method . They include tissue human animal origin , chemically cross-linked non cross-linked process , submucosal , pericardial , dermal tissue source . Current study investigate effectiveness mesh small short period follow-up . These shortcoming explain high cost mesh unclear indication use biological mesh . The aim study investigate short long term effect Strattice biological mesh . The investigator also inquire biologic mesh use direct indirect cost .</brief_summary>
