	<brief_title>Efficacy Isradipine Early Parkinson Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study enroll 336 participant multi-center study approximately 56 site across US Canada . In study , compare 10 mg Isradipine Placebo treatment newly diagnose PD patient . Isradipine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat high blood pressure consider investigational study , approve use patient PD.Isradipine affect function specialize channel present type brain cell affect PD patient . These cell usually responsible make dopamine , deplete patient PD . Isradipine may block damage cause flow certain chemical channel . Laboratory data show Isradipine may prevent development Parkinson-like symptom animal study . Isradipine evaluate patient PD . The first study isradipine control release ( CR ) patient early PD normal blood pressure find drug reasonably well tolerate safe . The controlled release formulation isradipine available use therefore study use immediate release formulation . Eligible participant follow 36 month expect complete 12 in-person visit 4 telephone visit . The study visit include clinical assessment motor , neuropsychiatric cognitive test well collection blood urine sample . Study drug take twice daily , morning evening without food . Prior take study drug , study participant require take blood pressure home blood pressure device provide use study .</detailed_description>
