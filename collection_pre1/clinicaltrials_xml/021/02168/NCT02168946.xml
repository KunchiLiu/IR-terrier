	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety , Tolerability Carbavance Compared Best Available Therapy Serious Infections Due Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae , Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current era increase resistance extend spectrum cephalosporin penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination , carbapenem antimicrobial agent frequently antibiotics `` last defense '' resistant pathogens serious infection . However , recent dissemination serine carbapenemases ( e.g . KPC ) Enterobacteriaceae within many hospital worldwide pose considerable threat carbapenems member beta-lactam class antimicrobial agent . Infections cause CRE associate high mortality rate limit treatment option . The loss carbapenem class antimicrobial agent treatment Enterobacteriaceae ( frequently occur pathogen hospital setting ) , Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa represent critical setback modern patient care . As result current lack optimal treatment patient infection due CRE , physicians manage patient limit anti-infective option available , include aminoglycosides , polymyxin B , colistin , tigecycline , various combination . There limited efficacy data available many therapy use treat serious CRE infection , particularly combination , limited alternative therapy currently available , treatments become Best Available Therapy despite toxicity associate many . Vaborbactam novel beta-lactamase inhibitor inhibitory activity many serine beta-lactamase optimize inhibition KPC beta-lactamase potentiation carbapenems Enterobacteriaceae . Vaborbactam develop use meropenem ( broad spectrum injectable carbapenem antibiotic ) address challenge treatment serious infection cause pathogen increasingly resistant available treatment . Carbavance , ( meropenem/vaborbactam ) administer fix combination intravenous ( IV ) infusion , develop treat serious gram-negative infection , cUTI , AP , HABP , VABP , bacteremia , include infection cause bacteria resistant currently available carbapenems .</detailed_description>

Expectation subject estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 10 ml/min ( CockcroftGault ) receive hemodialysis least 2 time per week . 8 . For cUTI &amp; AP subject : expectation , judgment Investigator , indwell urinary catheter instrumentation ( include nephrostomy tubes and/or indwell stent ) remove replace ( removal clinically acceptable ) soon possible , longer 12 hour , randomization . For cIAI subject : • Expectation , judgment investigator , operative drainage/debridement/removal ( include open laparotomy , percutaneous drainage , laparoscopic surgery ) intraabdominal collection potential source intra abdominal infection perform ; • Expectation culture aforementioned procedure ( include open laparotomy , percutaneous drainage , laparoscopic surgery ) send microbiological evaluation , include gram stain , culture susceptibility testing , Carbavance susceptibility test . 9 . Female subject childbearing potential , include less 2 year post menopausal , must agree , comply , use 2 highly effective method birth control ( i.e. , condom plus spermicide , combine oral contraceptive , implant , injectable , indwell intrauterine device , sexual abstinence , vasectomized partner ) participate study .
