	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) life-saving treatment end-stage renal disease patient . However , cardiovascular disease remain major cause morbidity mortality PD patient . It realize chronic asymptomatic intravascular hypervolemia important cause cardiovascular disease PD patient . OBJECTIVES To determine effect treat asymptomatic fluid overload blood pressure , hospitalization cardiovascular morbidity PD patient . HYPOTHESIS The investigator hypothesize treat asymptomatic fluid overload could improve clinical outcome PD patient . DESIGN &amp; SUBJECTS This open label randomize control trial . The investigator plan recruit 60 PD patient asymptomatic fluid overload , define overhydration ( OH ) ≥ 2 liter . Patients randomize active fluid management ( treatment arm ) conventional management ( control arm ) . STUDY INSTRUMENTS Overhydration identify bioimpedance spectroscopy . INTERVENTIONS For treatment arm , active fluid management include dietary counseling , diuretic , intensive dialysis regimen . For control arm , patient receive dietary counseling . Patients follow one year . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Blood pressure control , number hospital admission duration hospitalization cause , hospitalization cardiovascular disease study period . DATA ANALYSIS Blood pressure control compare Student 's test . Hospitalization data compare non-parametric Mann Whitney U test . EXPECTED RESULTS The study determine benefit treat asymptomatic fluid overload PD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit 60 PD patient asymptomatic fluid overload , define overhydration ( OH ) ≥ 2 liter measure bioimpedance spectroscopy . Patients clinical symptom fluid overload ( include , restrict , dyspnea exertion , peripheral edema , pulmonary congestion ) exclude . The investigator also exclude patient overt pulmonary edema require urgent medical care , cognitive impairment problem communication , unlikely survive three month , mechanical problem dialysis catheter , active peritonitis peritoneal failure .</detailed_description>
