	<detailed_description>This study seek incorporate genetic test postmortem examination case sudden unexplained death , initially San Diego County plan expand nationally internationally funding allows . Genetic test index subject parent ( biological family member parent available ) assess potential heritable cause sudden death . By combine wide catchment base San Diego Medical Examiner 's Office , sequence expertise SD-based collaborator , compute power San Diego Supercomputer Center in-house external genomic analytics , Scripps Translational Science Institute aim provide complete characterization understand genetic cause sudden death . Ultimately , finding study utilized identify previously unrecognized mechanism sudden death allow development preventative screening program potentially life-saving intervention .</detailed_description>
