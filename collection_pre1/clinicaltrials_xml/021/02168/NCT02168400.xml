	<detailed_description>The relapsing nature alcoholism major obstacle successful treatment . About 60 % enter treatment relapse within one year . To improve treatment outcome , new intervention target underlie brain biomarkers relapse vulnerability hold significant promise reduce critical public health problem . Using rest functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify brain biomarkers support long-term abstinence . Our cross-sectional longitudinal finding provide evidence high functional connectivity ( FC ) , particularly nucleus accumbens ( NAcc ) prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , potential brain biomarker support abstinence . Long-term abstinent alcoholic ( 7 year abstinence ) high rest FC NAcc PFC compare control . Short-term abstinent alcoholic ( 11 week abstinence ) intermediate FC ( low long-term abstinent alcoholic higher control ) ( Camchong et al. , 2013b ; 2013c ) . Further , low FC NAcc PFC 11 week abstinence predictor subsequent relapse ( 74 % accuracy ) ( Camchong et al. , 2013a ) . Moreover , pilot longitudinal FC study examine rest FC NAcc 5 13 week abstinence individual substance use disorder , find FC NAcc PFC decrease 5 13 week abstinence subsequent relapsers , increase subsequent abstainer ( Camchong et al. , 2014 ) . Based , believe long-term abstinence support compensatory mechanism mediate proper executive function reward ( mediate PFC-NAcc FC ) , potential brain biomarker could intervention target . These finding provide compel case explore whether brain biomarker modulate enhance patient ' ability remain abstinent . There need investigate method use increase FC PFC NAcc . Cognitive flexibility , ability change maladaptive behavior , depend PFC input NAcc ( Gruber O'Donnell , 2009 ) . PFC transmit reward representation NAcc glutamatergic projection guide goal-directed behavior ( Ballard et al. , 2011 ) . If PFC fail activate require , common observation substance use disorder , target neuron NAcc core receive critical information need select appropriate outcome , cause acquire maladaptive response pattern persist ( e.g . drug consumption ) ( Gruber O'Donnell , 2009 ) . Higher FC PFC NAcc may achieve stimulate PFC subject perform task require cognitive flexibility , reversal learn task . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) non-invasive brain stimulation technique modulate brain connectivity . PFC stimulation may increase input NAcc facilitate proper selection goal-directed behavior may also decrease crave individual substance use disorder ( Boggio et al. , 2008 ) . We propose therapeutic intervention stimulates PFC ( ) enhance PFC-NAcc FC , ( ii ) facilitate cognitive flexibility ( iii ) reduce crave promote abstinence individual alcohol use disorder . The long term goal develop new addiction treatment support long-term abstinence . The overall objective proposal enhance FC PFC NAcc therapeutic intervention enhance cognitive flexibility reduce crave addiction . Central hypothesis : PFC stimulation ( ) enhance FC NAcc PFC ( ii ) reduce crave addiction . In single-blind randomized design , 20 abstinent ( 2 week abstinent ) individual alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) recruit Lodging Plus Program receive 10 session ( 2 session per day 5 day ) either ( ) transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) PFC ( ii ) sham-tDCS . All subject perform reversal learn task tDCS intervention ( active sham ) prime engagement NAcc-PFC brain circuit mediate cognitive flexibility ( D'Cruz et al. , 2011 ) . Rest fMRI crave measure collect first last day tDCS session . Monthly follow-up interview conduct 6 month study completion query relapse status . Dependent variable ( ) change NAcc-PFC FC 2 3 week abstinence , ( ii ) change crave score 2 3 week abstinence ( iii ) relapse status 6 month study participation . Aim 1 : To investigate whether NAcc-PFC FC modulate , compare magnitude change NAcc-PFC FC active-tDCS sham-tDCS group . Aim 2 : To determine PFC stimulation short-term effect behavior relate clinical outcome , compare change craving score ( difference crave score 2 3 week abstinence ) active-tDCS sham-tDCS group . Aim 3 : To correlate neuromodulation intervention long-term clinical outcome , record craving relapse status 6 month follow treatment discharge . We examine relationship change NAcc-PFC FC 2 3 week abstinence subsequent ( ) monthly crave score ( ii ) relapse status .</detailed_description>
