	<brief_summary>A simple , painless reliable method detect Parkinson 's disease early stage important patient , doctor researcher . Doctors want help patient early , scientist want select patient research help development well drug . We hope change electrical activity hand muscle handwrite help early detection disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study use analysis electrical activity record hand muscle handwrite rest . There two group subject : early Parkinson 's disease patient healthy people . The researcher analyze record data know patient healthy , subject identify number . Healthy volunteer similar age patient . In course study , various property hand muscle electrical activity examine , result verify third party . A neurologist accrue 10 early PD patient mild symptom 10 healthy control . Inclusion exclusion criterion participant ( early PD patient healthy control ) describe client discussion neurologist . It important healthy control similar early PD patient term age , gender , factor might also cause difference EMG signal . The neurologist 's diagnosis participant ' disease status ( early PD health ) consider `` reference standard test '' result , keep confidential end study . That , neurologist know diagnosis participant accrue end study . An assistant ( recorder ) , know disease status participant know study design ( e.g. , many PD participant many health control ) , record EMG signal participant follow pre-specified protocol . The order participant examine recorder randomize . The signal analyze software provide client result need diagnosis output save individual file , one participant . Another assistant ( reader ) , contact participant know study design ( e.g. , many PD participant many health control ) , would diagnose individual early PD health base analysis output , accord pre-specified rule describe proposal . At end study , reader 's diagnosis compare neurologist 's diagnosis third party . A diagnosis reader define correct diagnosis neurologist 's diagnosis . The success rate approach diagnose early PD disease define total number correct diagnosis reader divide total number diagnosis , equal total number participant . Statistical analysis The null hypothesis reject , i.e. , client 's claim capability approach diagnose early PD accept , number correct diagnosis equal exceed 15 , Otherwise , null hypothesis reject client ' claim capability approach diagnose early PD accept . We claim success rate approach le 0.8 . We denote P0 ( = 0.5 ) success rate null hypothesis , P1 success rate alternative hypothesis . We expect P1 &gt; = 0.80 base pilot study result . A sample size 20 participant achieve 80 % power detect difference ( P1-P0 ) 0.30 use one-sided binomial test . The target significance level 0.05 . The actual significance level achieve test 0.0207 . These result assume population proportion null hypothesis 0.50 . As secondary objective , client could also generate estimate 95 % confidence interval sensitivity specificity approach diagnose PD . However , note give small sample size , could n't produce accurate estimate sensitivity specificity . For example , 10 PD participant , assume sensitivity 0.9 , width 95 % CI estimate sensitivity would large 0.44 .</detailed_description>
