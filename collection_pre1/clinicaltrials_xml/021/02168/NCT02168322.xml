	<brief_summary>Membrane modifecation : Guided tissue membrane perforation may serve biologic scaffold could allow free passage biologic mediator periosteum overlie gingival connective tissue periodontal defect . Study hyposethis : To test hyposthesis , study design evaluate level vascular endothelial cell growth factor platlet derived growth factor gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) early stage heal localized intrabony defect treat modify perforate membrane ( MPMs ) , occlusive membrane ( OMs ) compare open flap debridement control ( OFD ) . Methods : Thirty non-smoking patient severe chronic periodontitis participate prospective , randomized single blind trial . Each patient contribute one interproximal defect randomly assign experimental modify perforated membrane group ( 10 site ) , occlusive membrane group ( 10 site ) open flap debridement control ( 10 site ) . Plaque index , gingival index , probe depth ( PD ) , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) intrabony depth defect ( IBD ) measure baseline patient enrollment . Gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) sample collect day 1 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 30 day therapy . The primary outcome variable change VEGF PDGF-BB level site treat MPMs OM compare OFD treat case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>surgical procedure : - All surgery perform operator ( AYG ) . - The surgical treatment phase initiate subject full-mouth dental plaque score less one site plaque score 0 . - Surgical procedure accomplish described detail Gamal Iacono . 14 Under local anesthesia , mucoperiosteal flap elevate start internal bevel incision mucogingival junction allow passive closure . Debridement inflammatory granulation tissue intrabony defect perform mean Gracey 7/8 metal curette sound , healthy bone surface obtain . At time point , teeth thoroughly root plan combine use metal curettes power-driven instrumentation . - For MPM treat site , collagen membrane perforation prepare surgery use custom make 1 mm diameter pin 1mm perforate acrylic template coronal occlusive rim 3 mm . Inter-perforation space determine less 2mm order avoid loss membrane stiffness . Thereafter , collagen membrane hydrate sterile saline , trim accord template prepared defect , adapt defect manner entire defect ≥2 surround alveolar bone completely cover avoid membrane collapse within defect . The membrane extend supracrestally 1 mm CEJ ensure optimum gingival CT involvement supracrestal wound heal . Collagen membrane simply adapt place accord surgical protocol manufacturer without suture . The mucoperiosteal flap coronally position cover entire membrane suture 5-0 non-resorbable suture . - No periodontal dressing apply . OM OFD site treat way except use occlusive membrane defect closure without use membrane . All patient receive oral write postoperative instruction . - Patients prescribed amoxicillin ( 500 mg ) ‡ every 8 hour 1 week . Subjects allergy amoxicillin derivative prescribe Clindamycin ( 300 mg ) every 8 hour . - Plaque control effort supplement rinse chlorhexidine ( 0.12 % chlorhexidine hydrochloride § ) one minute three time daily 2 week . The patient instruct refrain tooth brush interdental cleaning avoid surgical area time . - Sutures remove 14 day postoperatively recall appointment observation adverse tissue reaction oral hygiene reinforcement schedule every second week first 2 month surgery . - One month surgery , patient instruct resume normal mechanical oral hygiene measure , consist brush use soft toothbrush roll-technique flossing . Supportive periodontal maintenance include oral hygiene reinforcement supragingival scaling perform recall appointment . Gingival Crevicular Fluid ( GCF ) Sampling : To avoid irritation , sample obtain 1 day follow surgery individual fast overnight 8:00AM 10:00AM . - Using micropipettes ( 5 ul ) , GCF sample collect 21 single examiner ( MA ) mask attribution site group . - Following isolation dry select site cotton roll , fisher brand disposable micropipettes € place intrasulcularly mesiofacial line angle select site maximum depth 2 mm gingival margin . Micropipettes leave place 5 µl fluid collect . - GCF sample collect day 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 30 day therapy dilute saline solution ( 50 µl ) evaluation VEGF PDGF-BB level . Samples label , carry dark container keep -26 C use .</detailed_description>
