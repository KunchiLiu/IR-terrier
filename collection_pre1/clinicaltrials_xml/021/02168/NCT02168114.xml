	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine potential Optical Imaging technique detect muscle damage boys Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy unaffected exercised muscle . Healthy subject undergo two different exercise opposite forearm image technique perform . Boys Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy undergo image technique without exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective proposal validate potential Optical Imaging technique able detect quantify muscle damage population affect Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , muscle waste disease , healthy population undergone temporal muscle damage result exercise intervention . Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy relentlessly progressive degenerative muscle waste disease , clinically characterize progressive muscle weakness , loss ambulation , premature mortality . Currently , know cure exist treatment benefit patient diagnose Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy limit . New approach , cell therapy , gene transfer , pharmacological intervention show promising result animal model human study great potential develop effective therapeutic treatment . One major limitation test intervention ; however . lack effective method monitor cellular tissue change take place response therapy . The ability determine cellular tissue specific change damage muscle real time , non-invasively , repeatedly , without exposure harmful radiation , minimal patient discomfort , low operating cost would enable high throughput faster investigation potential therapy . The propose study focus development Optical Imaging technology near infrared range wavelength differentiate damage normal muscle tissue . Near infrared light ( 700 - 900 nm ) demonstrate ability deeply penetrate biological tissue , skin , muscle without appreciable attenuation auto-fluorescence . The investigator anticipate Indocyanine Green enhance Optical Imaging use image exercise induce acute muscle damage healthy individual damage muscle boy Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy . It anticipate work may fulfill need image biomarkers monitor quantify cellular damage , muscle perfusion , drug delivery - non-invasively , use benign light , repeatedly , real time , intention accelerate test efficacy clinical trial neuromuscular disorder . The study design determine ability Optical Imaging reliable , safe , relatively inexpensive , facile tool detect quantify muscle damage . Investigators anticipate type imaging modality provide clinically useful information diagnostic prognostic purpose patient neuromuscular disease , especially boys Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy .</detailed_description>
