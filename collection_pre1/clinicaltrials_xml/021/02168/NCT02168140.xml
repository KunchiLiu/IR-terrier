	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose CPI-613 give together bendamustine hydrochloride treat patient relapsed refractory T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma . CPI-613 may kill cancer cell turn mitochondrion , use cancer cell produce energy building block need make cancer cell . By shut mitochondrion , CPI-613 may deprive cancer cell energy supply need survive grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving CPI-613 bendamustine hydrochloride may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPI-613 Bendamustine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CPI-613 [ 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid ] , use combination bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) patient relapse refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) receive hematopoietic cell transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ( RR ) disease control rate ( DCR ) , derive modified International Work Group ( IWG ) criteria International Cutaneous Lymphoma ( Olsen criterion ) cutaneous lymphoma . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) , possible correlation RR DCR derive modify IWF criterion vs. OS PFS . III . To evaluate assessment bone marrow biopsy , possible correlation complete response ( CR ) vs. bone marrow biopsy assessment ( e.g. , clear infiltration leukemic cell accord morphology , and/or negative leukemic cell accord immunohistochemistry ) . IV . To evaluate safety CPI-613 + bendamustine combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid . Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-4 week 1 day 1 4 week 2 3 . Patients also receive bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 4 5 week 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
