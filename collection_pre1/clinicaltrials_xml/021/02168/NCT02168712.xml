	<brief_summary>Exercise therapy increase functional capacity improve morbidity mortality patient cardiovascular disease . Moderate continuous training best establish train modality patient . However , body evidence begin emerge demonstrate high intensity interval training obtain well result term morbidity mortality . The purpose randomized clinical trial determine effect two type exercise training : moderate continuous train vs high interval train functional capacity quality life well verify safety application . We include 72 patient coronary artery disease assign one training modality 8 week . We analyze cyclo-ergo-spirometry data , aspect relate quality life well record adverse event .</brief_summary>
