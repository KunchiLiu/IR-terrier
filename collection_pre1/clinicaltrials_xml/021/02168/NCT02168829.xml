	<brief_summary>This trial compare medical approach stroke prevention people atrial fibrillation ( AF ) undergone successful procedure call ablation eliminate substantially reduce arrhythmia . AF normally associate increase risk stroke many patient prevented appropriate blood thinner therapy . This trial compare strategy oral anticoagulant therapy successful ablation therapy aspirin per day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optimal Anticoagulation Higher Risk Patients Post-Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , randomized trial investigate whether strategy ongoing , long-term oral anticoagulation rivaroxaban 15 mg daily superior strategy antiplatelet therapy , ASA 75-160 mg , alone prevent cerebral embolic event moderately high risk patient follow successful catheter ablation atrial fibrillation.. At least one year post-successful catheter ablation AF leave atrial flutter/tachycardia without evidence clinically apparent arrhythmia recurrence base least one 24 hour Holter ECG within 6 month last ablation procedure least one 24 hour Holter ECG 6 12 month post-ablation beyond . Patient must atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter atrial tachycardia &gt; 30 second detect minimum 48 hour Holter monitor within two month prior enrollment . Patients randomize 1:1 fashion ASA 75-160 mg daily rivaroxaban 15 mg daily . Patients see 6 month , one year every year thereafter minimum 3 year . Blood chemistry test , ECG , holters patient quality life questionnaire do annually . Cerebral MRI scan baseline , year one three year do assessment silent cerebral infarction . MRI image perform use specific protocol . A pre-specified subset patient undergo insertion implantable loop recorder ( ILR ) capable automate AF detection .</detailed_description>
