	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose CPI-613 ( 6,8-bis [ benzylthio ] octanoic acid ) give together bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab treat patient B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma come back responded treatment . Drugs use chemotherapy , 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may find cancer cell help kill . Giving 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CPI-613 , use combination bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) rituximab patient relapse refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) , receive hematopoietic cell transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ( RR ) disease control rate ( DCR ) , derive modified International Work Group ( IWG ) criterion . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) progression-free-survival ( PFS ) , possible correlation RR DCR derive modify IWG criterion vs. OS PFS . III . To evaluate assessment bone marrow biopsy , possible correlation complete response ( CR ) vs. bone marrow biopsy assessment ( e.g. , clear infiltration leukemic cell accordingly morphology , and/or negative leukemic cell accord immunohistochemistry ) . IV . To evaluate safety CPI-613 + bendamustine + rituximab combination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid . Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-4 ( week 1 ) day 1 4 ( week 2 3 ) . Patients also receive bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 4 5 rituximab day 5 week 1 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
