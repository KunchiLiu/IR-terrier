	<detailed_description>The Assessment Chiropractic Treatment 2 ( ACT2 ) assess change reaction/response time follow Chiropractic Manipulative Therapy ( CMT ) use randomize controlled trial member SFQ SOAR . This population face simultaneous physiological cognitive demand . The ability give accurate appropriate motor response short time require successful completion type mission expect undertake . It possible chiropractic care improve performance reaction response time population low back pain population asymptomatic . One possible theory improvement , even asymptomatic person , may experience insult stress body subclinical alters ability function optimal manner . Thus person may asymptomatic able accomplish many activity normal manner , stress limit maximum capability , effect subclinical abnormality may cause person function less optimal level . If CMT able restore normal , efficient mechanism function , therefore possible performance challenging task could improve .</detailed_description>
