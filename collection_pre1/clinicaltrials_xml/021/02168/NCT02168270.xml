	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ascorbic acid give together temozolomide treat patient high-grade glioma come back . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Ascorbic acid contain ingredient may prevent slow growth high-grade glioma . Giving temozolomide ascorbic acid may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity determine recommend dose intravenous ascorbic acid give three time weekly combination temozolomide patient recurrent high grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate change level serum ascorbic acid ( use high-performance liquid chromatography [ HPLC ] coulometric electrochemical detection ) therapy ascorbic acid temozolomide . II . Radiographic assessment disease status 2 cycle therapy ascorbic acid temozolomide . III . To evaluate progression-free overall survival patient recurrent high grade glioma treat therapy ascorbic acid temozolomide . IV . To descriptively examine quality life ( QOL ) use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Questionnaires ( QLQ ) -C30 treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ascorbic acid . Patients receive ascorbic acid intravenously ( IV ) 90-120 minute three time per week temozolomide orally day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 1 year periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
