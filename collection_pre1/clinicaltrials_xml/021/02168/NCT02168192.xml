	<brief_title>Breaking Bad News Obstetrics : A Trial Simulation-Debrief Based Education</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator ' study part plan educational initiative break bad news communication skill , plan house staff department Obstetrics Gynecology . All subject undergo baseline post-education simulation . The investigator ' study intervention personalize review debrief simulation , compare conventional lecture order ass best curriculum teach skill set . The investigator ' study design describe , consent obtain consent house staff randomize participate simulation-based education session/debrief attend lecture . Randomization achieve use sequential opaque envelope contain allocation card , designate group assignment . A physician involve study randomly insert allocation card envelop group assignment conceal enrollment complete . Subjects assign study number . The list subject identifier study number keep separate study data , destroy phase study complete . All study data identify information delete , store password protect database . The investigator plan subject assess baseline characteristic break bad news skill use self-assessment tool . Subsequently house staff evaluate management break bad news baseline SP scenario , assessments physician-teachers well SPs . These SPs non-physicians , supervisory control study subject . The physician-teachers co-investigators study : Drs . Chazotte , Dayal , Landsberger , Bernstein , Goffman , Karkowsky . After baseline assessment , intervention group debrief baseline simulation physician educator . The control group instead undergo conventional lecture `` Breaking Bad News '' technique . Finally , group undergo second simulation , assess SPs physician-teachers After step , subject fill self-assessment tool BBN . House staff undergo conventional curriculum attend lecture ; similarly , subject intervention group opportunity review simulation personal debriefing session . Six month study , plan subject fill self-assessment form assess long-term change BBN skill sustain . SPs formally train scenario response , well standardized assessment subject .</detailed_description>
