	<brief_title>An Open Label Randomised Trial RNActive® Cancer Vaccine High Risk Intermediate Risk Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study second clinical trial RNActive® vaccine . It compose 6 RNActive® drug product component , cod 6 antigen overexpressed PCA compare healthy tissue . Each 6 prostate specific antigen encode CV9104 capable induce adaptive immunity . Needle-free injection system , like Tropis® device i.d . injection , overcome disadvantage relate needle- syringe-based i.d . injection . Tropis® currently use different vaccine clinical trial around world . The use Tropis® i.d . delivery CV9104 approve BfArM .</detailed_description>
