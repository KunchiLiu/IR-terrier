	<detailed_description>In 2010 , Joint Commission ( JC ) issue Sentinel Event Alert highlight need detect suicide risk non-behavioral patient medical setting . Detecting suicide risk among medical patient important population elevate risk suicidal thought behavior , many patient , medical visit portal mental health service . Of note , vast majority people die suicide visit medical setting , inpatient oncology unit , frequently psychiatric set month lead death . Thus , inpatient medical setting important stakeholder decrease suicide-related morbidity mortality . Physicians nurse work non-mental health setting require tool guide recognize patient risk . Nonetheless , currently suicide screen instrument design specifically assess suicide risk adult inpatient medical population . In 2012 , study team conduct Quality Improvement Project ( QIP ) National Institutes Health Clinical Center ( NIH CC ) demonstrate asQ em ( Ask Suicide-Screening Questions Everyone Medical Settings ) , brief instrument pilot detect suicidal thought behavior among adult medical inpatient , feasible administer acceptable patient staff .
