	<brief_summary>Analysis cell free DNA ( cfDNA ) , unlike tissue biopsy , present new tool monitoring treatment cancer . The investigator develop differentiated sequence assay , Digital Sequencing Technology ( DST ) enable detection rare genomic abnormality ultra high-specificity sensitivity . The investigator assay able eliminate error distortion create sample-prep sequencing process standard NGS ( next-generation sequencing ) workflows produce near-perfect representation rare variant . The investigator show sequence comprehensive cancer panel 80kbp 0.1 % cancer cell line titration sample , standard Illumina SBS ( sequence synthesis ) generate many high-quality false positive variant call range 0.05-5 % , investigator assay result highly sensitive completely error-free variant call across entire panel . This work indicate remarkable potential use investigator assay deep analysis cfDNA , thereby allow researcher clinician comprehensively non-invasively monitor genetic dimension cancer throughout body .</brief_summary>
