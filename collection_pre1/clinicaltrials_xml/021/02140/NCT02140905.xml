	<brief_summary>The study two objective base intended-use measurement population describe . The first objective show relative change impedance measure test device ( ΔSFI ) strongly correlate amount fluid remove dialysis ( ΔF ) subject ESRD possibly Heart Failure . The second objective demonstrate correlation ΔSFI relative change impedance ( ΔZ ) measure reference device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neck-Worn Monitoring Sensor - A Study Monitoring Subjects With Fluid-Management Issues During Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study validate test device 's measurement parameter call 'sternal fluid index ' ( SFI ) patient diagnose medical condition relate fluid management , e.g . end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , undergoing dialysis . The reference device study measure average amplitude thoracic bio-impedance signal ( Z ) parameter call 'thoracic fluid content ' ( TFC ) , equal 1000/Z . The test device measure SFI localize region near sternum , whereas reference device measure Z TFC entire thoracic cavity . This mean Z ( TFC ) SFI , measure approximately time , likely correlate different absolute value . Thus , statistical analysis investigate ability SFI track fluid , well agreement fluid-dependent trend display SFI Z ( TFC ) , describe . During study investigator collect multiple sample , contain value SFI test device , value TFC Z reference device . The investigator enroll approximately 20-50 subject , goal least 20 subject complete study . The statistical analysis include data subject complete study . All subject undergo dialysis clinic . Approximately half third ESRD Heart Failure ( HF ) . The investigator measure sample subject every 15 minute standard dialysis session , typically last 3 4 hour . Levels extract fluid , determine dialysis machine , record time sample measure . The statistical model compare time-dependent change SFI Z value collect dialysis . It design demonstrate : 1 ) test device effective characterize fluid level use intend ; 2 ) test reference device ' measurement trend fluid substantially equivalent , since sense different physiological region expect yield different value impedance .</detailed_description>
