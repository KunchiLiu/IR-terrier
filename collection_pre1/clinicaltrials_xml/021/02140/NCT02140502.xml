	<brief_title>Incidence Fluoroquinolone Resistant Bacteria Patients Undergoing Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screen age population many Western country , prostate biopsy detect prostate cancer take often . Prostate biopsy also perform surveillance prostate cancer . In case , biopsy take trans-rectally ultrasound guidance . Due trans-rectal route , inherent risk infectious complication . These complication range minor complication , bacteriuria epididymitis , severe complication require intensive care sepsis . The rate severe complication long estimate 1-2 % , steady rise observe since begin 21st century , center report occurrence rate high 8 % . Interestingly , rate complication relate procedure ( e.g . rectal bleeding , hematuria , hematospermia , dysuria ) remain constant . Prophylactic antibiotic routinely administer minimize rate infectious complication . The commonly use prophylactic antibiotic agent fluoroquinolones ( FQ ) . The observed rise rate severe complication attribute emerge strain FQ-resistant bacteria . Known risk factor harbor enteric resistant bacterial strain recent ( within three month ) antibiotic use travel area bacterial strain know endemic . When patient know harbor FQ-resistant enterobacteria , different prophylactic antibiotic chosen . In study , investigator aim prospectively establish incidence enteric FQ-resistant bacteria clinical patient cohort . This incidence study take rectal swab sample consent patient come prostate biopsy . The information gain study use mainly determine whether antibiotic prophylactic practice need update clinic . The investigator aim enroll 200 patient patient recruitment estimate take place May 2014 August 2014 . The study estimate end May 2016 .</detailed_description>
