	<brief_summary>Background : Meta-analyses large randomized trial prove superiority preoperative short course radiation surgery , compare surgery alone . Short course radiation result 50 % reduction term local relapse stage II III rectal cancer patient . Patients complete pathological remission additionally show significant survival benefit . Complete pathological remission ( pCR ) occur 8 % preoperative radiation &gt; 16 % interval radiation surgery least 8 week . It generally accept mutation TP53 gene represent crucial defect apoptosis pathway . Radiation therapy suggest act via induction apoptosis irradiate cell . Therefore , expect defect TP53 gene effect success radiation therapy . Currently available imaging tool hardly able diagnose response radiation therapy correctly , essentially correlate tumor size . Method : Aim prospective observation study strengthen hypothesis TP53 genotype promise marker predict response radiation therapy rectal cancer patient . Consequently , expect result justify prospective , randomize intervention trial obtain level evidence I p53 marker hypothesis . Trial endpoint downstaging pCR rate . Tumor stage pathological remission evaluate MRT pathohistology correlate TP53 genotype diagnostic biopsy . Additionally , investigate applicability novel image modality magnet resonance tomography monitor response radiotherapy . The objective study - evaluate effect genetic tumor marker ( TP53 genotype ) response preoperative short course radiation ( term downstaging pCR rate ) - evaluate applicability novel magnet resonance tomography image modality monitor response preoperative short time radiation . Conclusion : The prospective evaluation potential predictive marker TP53 may bring u one-step closer individualize therapy regimen , allow restriction preoperative radiation rectal cancer patient benefit .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients eligible observational study treat accord current standard preoperative short course radiation ( 5x5 Gy ) subsequent interval surgery least 8 maximum 16 week . According standard rectal cancer therapy , eligible patient meet follow criterion : Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma rectum Tumor stag MRI Inferior margin tumor locate far 15 cm anal verge level S12 Tumor stage T2 T3 No evidence metastatic disease No prior tumor therapy rectal pelvic cancer ( surgery , radio , chemo , immunotherapy , molecular target therapy , type tumor therapy ) Medical fitness patient treatment ( decide involve physician ) Patient compliance Signed informed consent patient legal representative , analysis tumor include genetic analysis tumor DNA . Patients exclude study follow reason Clinical stage T1 ( appropriate local excision ) , Clinical stage T4 ( Radio/Chemotherapy ) Clinical stage M+ ( distant metastasis ) No tumor stag MRI Inoperability ( technical functional ) Prior tumor therapy pelvis Concurrent administration tumor therapy Second primary malignancy clinically detectable time consideration study enrollment Serious concomitant disorder attitude patient would compromise safety patient his/her ability complete study .</criteria>
