	<brief_summary>An increase number publication demonstrate homologous ( allogeneic ) blood transfusion impair outcome cancer non-cancer patient . Leukocyte depletion blood product solve problem , despite improve quality red cell ; recent study demonstrate deteriorated outcome cancer patient elective colon surgery transfusion leukocyte deplete allogeneic blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunomodulation Effect Blood Transfusion Operative Spine Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient undergo identical anesthesiological procedure , include premedication , general anesthesia endotracheal intubation , monitor postoperative pain therapy mobilization.Surgery perform identical team perform standardize technique . Transfusion regimen The 'trigger ' homologous red cell transfusion intra- postoperatively actual hematocrit concentration . Transfusion depend discretion treat physician . Number unit transfuse , amount blood loss , time , reason decision maker record . Blood sample Within kind surgical procedure choose study chance red cell transfusion 60 - 70 % . In term figure 10 non-transfused case could gain within 40 case total . However , transfusion non-transfusion happen row . We expect total number patient blood withdrawal 50 60 . Additionally withdrawn sample currently use analysis store study . The purpose include non-transfused otherwise fully comparable patient distinguish trauma ( operation ) transfusion influence immune modulation . Within study blood transfusion immune modulation make differentiation . In patient colorectal cancer surgery randomize group autologous predonation patient allogeneic transfusion compare . However , within latter ( allogeneic ) group 27 patient 13 transfused , thus create non-transfusion group 14 patient . These 14 non-transfused patient remain within study compare autologous allogeneic transfuse patient . Operative trauma allogeneic transfusion increase secretion several cytokine include tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha Interleukin-10 ; effect less pronounced patient autologous- without transfusion . Another group study forty three orthopedic patient total knee- hip-arthroplasty , initially compare autologous allogeneic red cell transfusion . They change protocol due small number allogeneic transfusion ( 8 43 ) . Including perioperatively transfuse patient ( n = 37 ) find increase immune regulatory cytokine Interleukin ( IL ) -10 red cell transfusion , pronounce 7 day surgery , whereas mild increase non- autologous transfused patient . Unfortunately differentiate autologous-and non-transfused patient . Thus data could reveal effect surgery analyze parameter .</detailed_description>
