	<brief_summary>The propose trial address two clinically important question young patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) : optimal dose daunorubicin induction therapy necessity second induction cycle patient good response first induction . In first part trial , patient randomly assign receive either 90 mg/m2 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin first induction cycle addition standard dose cytarabine . The primary endpoint rate good responder . Assuming superiority 90 mg/m2 , 436 patient recruit . In second part trial , good responder randomize receive either second induction cycle . Assuming non-inferiority single induction regard rate complete remission , number 360 patient included second part . Secondary outcome relapse-free survival , overall survival minimal residual disease kinetics . Patients recruit 40 treatment center Study Alliance Leukemia study group period 40 month . The result great clinical relevance : First , study could facilitate establishment confirmation optimal daunorubicin dose . Furthermore , case non-inferiority single versus double induction good responder , half young AML patient could spar second induction cycle , lead reduction treatment-related mortality , few day spend hospital improve quality life .</brief_summary>
