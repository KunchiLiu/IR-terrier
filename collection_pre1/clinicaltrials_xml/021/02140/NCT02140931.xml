	<brief_summary>A randomized , double-blind placebo control study determine safety efficacy Angiogenic Cell Precursors ( ACPs ) relieve symptoms Critical Limb Ischemia patient treat standard care surgical revascularization option . It assume ACP-treated group low amputation death rate compare placebo group . Other hemodynamic , image clinical parameter also compare two group . Quality life assessment also perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo control study ass efficacy safety autologous ACPs administer intramuscularly low extremity subject CLI lack surgical endovascular revascularization option . A total approximately 95 subject randomize treatment ACP-01 placebo use 2:1 randomization scheme , respectively , stratify site . The study continue subject treat experience study event ( either de novo gangrene , double wound size , major amputation , death ) event-free least 26 week . Subjects treat follow longer 52 week . One futility analysis potentially stop study enrollment perform . Subjects treat investigative site provide write informed consent prior conduct study-related procedure . Thereafter , screen meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol trial undergo study procedure include intramuscular injection investigational medicinal product ( IMP = ACP-01 placebo ) . The IMP administer addition conventional treatment subject receiving . The control group receive placebo injection low extremity ensure blind assessor subject . The placebo consist medium use ACP product suspension . The study consist four period : Screening period , Treatment period , Acute safety follow-up Long term follow-up period . The total duration study participation , include follow-up , least 26 week . Subjects follow 52 week least last subject complete his/her 26 week visit .</detailed_description>
