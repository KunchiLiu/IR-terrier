	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) macular edema ( swell ) central retina . This cause decrease central vision . The cause macular edema unknown , may involve inflammation . The drug minocycline might help prevent inflammation therefore might help treat macular edema improve central visual function . Objectives : - To see minocycline help people RP macular edema . Eligibility : - People 12 year old RP macular edema least eye . Design : - Participants screen medical eye disease history . They eye exam blood test . One eye macular edema study eye . If eye affect , one designate study eye . - Participants visit clinic least 9 time least 14 month . The first 3 study visit monthly , every 2 month . - Participants start take minocycline visit 3 . They take 1 pill twice daily least 1 year . - Participants keep medicine diary bring visit pill bottle unused pill . At study visit , participant follow test : - eye thyroid exam - blood pregnancy test - microperimetry : participant press button see light computer screen - visual field measurement : participant look spots white screen test side vision - electroretinogram : A person dark adapt sit dark 30 minute . After placement numb eye drop , special contact lens place . The participant watch flash light recording make .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Oral Minocycline Treating Bilateral Cystoid Macular Edema Associated With Retinitis Pigmentosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) broad category genetically heterogeneous disease involve progressive visual loss constriction visual field loss night vision . In one-third patient , peripheral vision loss compound central visual acuity loss development cystic macular change . While RP genetic disease , etiology progressive cell death , include associate cystoid macular edema ( CME ) , completely understood . Inflammatory process involve activation resident immune cell retina call microglia hypothesize contribute . Minocycline inhibit activation microglia , decrease production inflammatory factor implicate RP progression . The objective study investigate safety possible efficacy oral minocycline participant CME RP . Study Population : Five participant , age 12 older , unilateral bilateral CME associate RP enrol initially . However , additional five participant may enrol replace participant may withdraw study prior reach Month 6 visit . Design : This pilot , single-center , uncontrolled , open-label , prospective , Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluate minocycline potential treatment CME secondary RP . A pre-treatment phase last two month institute prior investigational product ( IP ) initiation assess anatomical variability CME well variability measurable parameter part natural history disease . Participants receive oral dose 100 mg ( appropriate weight adjust pediatric dose ) minocycline twice daily 12 month . There common termination date , take place last recruited participant receive 12 month IP . Participants recruit earlier part study continue take IP follow every two month common termination date . At visit , participant visual acuity measure undergo optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) test measure retinal thickness . Measures central visual field sensitivity full-field electroretinogram ( ERG ) microperimetry ( MP-1 ) also collect . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome change CME base OCT measurement study eye 6 month compare pre-treatment value . Secondary outcome include change OCT thickness , change amplitude photopic scotopic response ERG testing , change microperimetry , change visual field measure HVF 30-2 visual field test 6 month 12 month compare pre-treatment value , well CME change OCT 12 month compare pre-treatment value . Pre-treatment measurement analyze measure natural variability CME well measure variability functional testing . Safety outcomes include number severity adverse event ( AEs ) . Ocular safety outcome indicate change visual acuity , ocular surface change , intraocular inflammation ocular change consistent natural progression RP .</detailed_description>
