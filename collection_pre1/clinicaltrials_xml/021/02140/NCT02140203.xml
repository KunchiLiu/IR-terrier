	<brief_summary>Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) cluster cardiovascular risk factor characterize central obesity , insulin resistance , dyslipidemia high blood pressure . The concept MetS represent pre-cardiovascular pre-diabetic pathologic condition , useful tool prognosing development cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus . Importantly , intervention apply pre-pathologic stage MetS would great clinical health significance achieve well preventive therapeutic outcome . Yoga , mind-body exercise , suggest beneficial effect dyslipidemia , hypertension diabetes . A pilot study demonstrate trend improvement metabolic parameter middle-aged adult MetS finding inconclusive small sample size brief yoga follow-up period ( i.e. , 2-month ) . In addition need well design randomize control trial study beneficial effect yoga control MetS middle-aged individual , investigation yoga MetS elderly population lacking . This important potential use yoga lifestyle modification elderly individual MetS result significant reduction prevalence cardiovascular disease diabetes . Thus , study aim examine efficacy yoga exercise improve metabolic abnormality middle-aged old adult MetS . In addition elderly , middle-aged adult include present investigation idea cardiovascular disease diabetes age mostly prevent intervention middle-age . A randomized control trial repeat measure design conduct examine effect 1-year regular yoga train MetS parameter middle-aged old individual 30-60 60-80 year age , respectively . Primary outcome measure include waist circumference , systolic/diastolic blood pressure , blood glucose , triglyceride , lipid cholesterol profile whereas secondary outcome measure include self-reported stress depression level . This study anticipate provide valuable information explore therapeutic role yoga manage MetS . As yoga exercise economical regimen easily readily apply large scale target population , hope practically useful relieve burden cardiovascular disease diabetes introduce yoga lifestyle management MetS .</brief_summary>
