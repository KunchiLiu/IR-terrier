	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Local Steroid Injection Wrist Splinting Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) cause pressure consequent compression median nerve within confined anatomical area wrist refer carpal tunnel . It common important socio-economic impact . The prevalence CTS UK 7-16 % . Its incidence estimate 88-125 per 100,000 USA . Economic consequence include direct financial implication treatment indirect cost absenteeism workplace . The median number day away work CTS among high 27 day . In US 1995 , 400,000 500,000 patient underwent surgical decompression . This equate economic cost excess $ 2 billion . CTS hearing loss find account morbidity , measure case work day lose , illness US work population . CTS may also occur work- related disorder lead compensation claim . Despite vast burden disease , consensus regard best management . Surgical treatment generally prefer severe case CTS . A Cochrane review investigate surgical treatment CTS show surgical treatment relief symptoms significantly well splinting , conclusion could draw people mild symptoms surgical treatment well steroid injection . On hand , surgical treatment relatively costly carry risk significant complication may last several month give rise work absence . In addition , wait time surgery usually long . For non-surgical intervention many modality trialed show discernable benefit . Local steroid injection wrist splint among popular option . They commonly employ mild moderate case CTS . For severe case , also offer relief complaint wait period surgery contra-indications surgery . Systematic review randomize controlled trial conclude local steroid injection provide great clinical improvement one month compare placebo weak evidence splint worn night effective treatment short term . However , number study compare two method limit , mostly either retrospective design prospective non-randomized . Two randomize control trial compare local steroid injection splint find respectively local steroid injection significantly improve clinical outcome compare anti-inflammatory drug splint injection steroid ineffective . However , conclusion two study limit either small sample size lack validate outcome measure . We would like conduct prospective randomize clinical trial compare efficacy local steroid injection splint patient CTS use Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire outcome measure 4-week follow-up . Patients attend medical clinic local hospital ( Kwong Wah Hospital ) complain finger hand numbness refer electro-neuro-diagnostic unit nerve conduction test . Consecutive patient clinical electrophysiological feature CTS invite participate study . Clinical feature pain , paresthesia weakness median nerve distribution least 3 month . The neurodiagnostic criterion base American Academy Neurology summary statement , classify abnormality follow : ( 1 ) mild abnormality , i.e. , abnormal comparative test prolong median distal sensory latency ( DSL &gt; 3.5 m ) normal median distal motor latency ( DML ) ; ( 2 ) moderate abnormality , i.e. , prolong median DSL DML ( â©¾4.2 m ) ; ( 3 ) severe abnormality , i.e. , absence median sensory nerve action potential prolong median DML absent compound muscle action potential . Patients exclude recognize cause CTS include inflammatory arthritis , diabetes mellitus , hypothyroidism , renal failure , polyneuropathy history significant local trauma . Other exclusion criterion include age young 18 year , previous treatment CTS pregnancy . Patients motor impairment thenar muscle atrophy also exclude referred Orthopedic unit assessment surgery . All potential participant inform objective procedure study , well possible complication . The patient give informed consent interview single investigator within 4 week NCV . Their demographical data include age , gender body mass index ( BMI ) record . The duration symptom , medical comorbidities employment status document . Examination hand perform investigator focus sensory loss tip digits 1 , 2 , 3 , medial side digit 4 , weakness atrophy abductor pollicis brevis opponens pollicis . Sensation assess use pinprick . Sensory motor function record either normal impaired . In patient bilateral CTS , symptomatic hand include . In case hand equally symptomatic , dominant hand include . Recruited patient ask complete Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) . They allocate one two treatment arm accord randomization procedure . Patients randomly assign one two treatment group use sequentially number opaque seal envelope ( SNOSE ) . Allocation concealment maintain randomization procedure . The local injection steroid perform investigator randomization . Using sterile technique , 20mg depomedrol premixed lidnocaine inject use 25-gauge x 5/8 '' needle . The needle insert medially palmaris longus tendon distal palmar crease wrist angle 45-degree forearm . The steroid inject approximately 1cm skin . The needle reposition resistance injection , pain paraesthesia median nerve territory . Minor complication steroid injection include local pain , bleeding , skin depigmentation , skin atrophy digital ischemia . Concerns nerve tendon injury may result steroid injection appear unfounded . In 28 study local steroid injection treatment involve 1981 hand total report instance injury , suggest risk low . There small risk infection . After randomization , hand patient splint group splint neutral position standard cotton-polyester splint . Patients encourage use splint nighttime whenever possible 1 month . The potential side effect splint include discomfort due local pressure allergic response splint material . The primary outcome measure clinical improvement one month . The Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire ( BCTQ ) use measure assess clinical response . It self-administered disease-specific questionnaire assess severity symptom functional status base two scale . The symptom severity scale ( SSS ) comprise 11 question , functional status scale ( FSS ) comprise 8 question . The assessment question scale 1-5 point , 1 indicates symptom , 5 indicates severe symptom . Each scale generate final score ( sum individual score divide number item ) range 1 5 . The evidence base psychometric property indicate BCTQ valid , reliable , responsive acceptable instrument include primary outcome measure CTS intervention trial . The questionnaire Chinese validity . Patients interview one month randomization . They ask complete BCTQ rate satisfaction treatment time . Duration sick leave employ patient , concomitant use analgesic , adverse effect record . As participant symptom CTS receive valid active treatment , motivate compliant protocol . They encourage report PI problem occur regard splint adverse effect develop treatment group . Appropriate action take advice give PI . The subject splint group instruct mark night worn splint calendar . Subjects miss schedule follow-up contact encouraged attend re-scheduled follow-up soon possible . Based previous study , minimum clinically important difference 0.74 BCTQ . With 90 % statistical power , 5 % significance level , two-sided statistical test , assume standard deviation 0.8 BCTQ score study detect true difference least 0.74 point BCTQ two intervention group 50 patient randomize . Version 20.0 SPSS statistical package use . Descriptive statistic present frequency , mean standard deviation median range appropriate . Baseline parameter patient two treatment group compare chi-square test categorical variable , Student 's test continuous variable normal distribution Mann-Whitney U test nonparametric continuous variable . BCTQ score treatment one , four twelve week treatment compare pair sample test . Differences BCTQ score two treatment group investigate independent sample test . For multi-variate analysis , multiple linear regression use compute difference outcome measure two treatment group , within group respective treatment adjustment baseline variable . Results consider statistically significant P value less 0.05 . This trial approve local ethic committee ( Kowloon West Cluster Ethical Committee ) .
