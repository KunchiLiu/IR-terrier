	<detailed_description>Background Bipolar seal cut device EnSeal® G2 Tissue Sealer surgical instrument use electrical powered diathermic energy seal transect tissue . These device show high efficiency wide variety open laparoscopic general gynecological surgical procedure . The surgical performance EnSeal® show comparable ultrasonic cut device several study . However , efficacy instrument particular new instrument EnSeal® G2 Tissue Sealer evaluate thyroid surgery . Primary Aim To verify whether EnSeal® performance superior standard surgical technique thyroidectomy randomize clinical trial 2 different institution Patients Methods A total 160 patient include study . They divide two group 80 subject . Patients undergo thyroidectomy two institution : The National Institute Medical Sciences Nutrition Mexico City Clinical Hospital Sao Paolo Brazil . Surgical indication thyroidectomy comprise benign malign disease . Design A balanced randomized clinical trial design assess superiority 2 institution . Patients benign malign thyroid disease balance priori within 2 group study . Sample Size Calculation The estimate number case calculate base potential difference surgical time , main outcome variable small difference detect . Sample size calculate assume hypothetical mean difference 15 minute 80 % statistical power , 95 % confidence , 5 % alpha error ( Type I error ) two-tied distribution hypothesis . Based assumption sample size least 75 subject per group ( arm ) necessary . Institutional Review Board Evaluation The protocol submit evaluation Institutional Review Board institution approve enrol first patient . This protocol follow institutional , governmental policy medical regulation clinical research human being . Informed Consent Ethical Considerations All patient receive complete information protocol . After brief explanation accept enrol need sign inform consent surgery . It necessary two independent witness may sign informed consent . All include patient des-identified keep anonymous record . A special registry number allocate every included subject . All potential harm risk minimize maximize benefit . This protocol adhere respect human dignity , privacy autonomy . Trial Registry The trial register ClinicalTrials.gov enrol first patient . Randomization Each group 80 patient divide 2 subgroup , one preoperative diagnosis benign disease preoperative diagnosis papillary thyroid carcinoma . Four set 42 envelope prepared randomization . All four group ( one benign malignant thyroid condition ) independently randomize institution time induction anesthesia . In total 80 patient , EnSeal® G2 Tissue Sealer use thyroid resection sub-platysmal flap develop opposite group , operation perform use standard tie &amp; suture technique two expert . Outcome Variables The primary outcome operative time ( minute ) , blood loss ( milliliter ) , loss signal laryngeal nerve monitoring , number ligature , pain intensity ( score ) surgical complication ( bleed , hematoma , hypoparathyroidism , superior laryngeal nerve injury recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy . Operational Definitions i. Operative Time Measured minute , start skin incision end last closing suture skin . Differences assess use t-student test . ii . Blood Loss Measured cc . Will evaluate weight soak sponge collect blood aspiration cannula . Differences evaluate use t-student test iii . Loss signal continuous recurrent laryngeal nerve monitor The number time loss electromyography signal recurrent laryngeal nerve record use continuous intraoperative neuro-monitoring analyze use Fisher´s exact t-student test iv . Number Ligatures : The number ligatures place blood vessel record . Differences analyze Fisher´s exact test Chi-squared test . v. Pain Intensity All patient receive standard dose pain medication . Pain assess 12 24hs surgery use Visual Analogue Scale pain medication dose record . Differences analyze use t-test . vi . Hypoparathyroidism Serum calcium , phosphorus , albumin intact parathyroid hormone measure every patient , 24 hour surgery . Patients correct calcium ≥7.5 mg/dl symptom hypocalcemia receive calcium supplement blood test obtain . In patient symptom ( tingle trembling , parenthesis , tetanic , cardiac manifestation ) and/or correct calcium &lt; 7.5 mg/dl . Ca supplement administer calcium / phosphorus / albumin measure every 2 week supplement wean . In case hypocalcemia persist 3 month , calcium/ phosphorus / albumin measure monthly 6 month . Transient hypoparathyroidism consider hypocalcemia recovers less 6 month diagnosis permanent hypoparathyroidism establish hypocalcemia persist 6 month . Differences analyze use Fisher´s exact test vii . Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injury All patient undergo preoperative postoperative laryngoscopy day surgery . At end operation , response assess direct stimulation vagus nerve recurrent laryngeal nerve . Acoustic response electrical amplitude record . In absence vocal cord abnormality postoperative laryngoscopy , evaluation perform . If vocal cord paralysis paresis find postoperative laryngoscopy , patient enter voice rehabilitation program subsequent laryngoscopies perform 2 week , 3 month 6 month surgery recovery . Transient recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis paresis consider vocal cord movement recovers less 6 month diagnosis permanent vocal cord paralysis establish vocal cord abnormality persist 6 month . Differences analyze use Fisher´s exact test . Data Collection Analysis All data obtain clinical file , laboratory exams register neuro-monitoring saved Excel sheet numerical range . All record databases keep anonymous . Correspondence include private personal data avoid . Statistical analysis perform commercially available software . Variable representation make mean excel , SPSS number . All include variable analyze base scaling . Variable distribution test statistical inference . Non-parametric analysis use case non-normal distribution . Any p value ≤5 % 0.05 ( type I error ) consider statistically significant two-tied hypothesis . Publication Authorship Considerations Any data result obtain study plan discuss two principal investigator . Authorship inclusion base Vancouver Convention Friedman guideline . An author must qualify he/she participated conception design study , acquisition data , analysis interpretation data . Any partial total publication public presentation data protocol require previous authorization principal investigator .</detailed_description>
