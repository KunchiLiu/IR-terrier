	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect liraglutide memory attention people insulin resistance . Liraglutide medication make body sensitive insulin , therefore may allow manage sugar effectively . The investigator look specifically region brain associate memory attention , call hippocampus , order see whether treatment treatment change performance memory attention task . The investigator also take MRI brain see whether change size shape hippocampus treatment . All subject study 50-70 year old pre- diabetes . Half subject family history dementia , half .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data study use measure change hippocampal morphology , functional alteration hippocampus paired associative memory task , functional connectivity rest , neuropsychological performance hippocampally-mediated cognitive task , follow double-blind treatment liraglutide placebo . Primary Hypothesis : Subjects receive liraglutide show significant difference hippocampal morphology , functional activation connectivity , neuropsychological performance , compare subject receive placebo . Exploratory Aim : To test potential interaction modifiable ( IR/prediabetes ) non-modifiable ( FamHxAD , APOE 4 ) risk factor respect morphological , functional , neuropshchological change double-blind liraglutide treatment . Study Procedures The study explain participant inform consent obtain . Participant also ask whether consent videotape study , , part study participation may videotape staff training purpose . Participants continue current psychiatric medication ( ) psychotherapy duration study ( eg . change make currently receive treatment ) . Psychiatric Assessment - This consist Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) , 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-17 ) , Mini Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) . The MINI interview take approximately 20-30 minute depend individual presentation screen skip-out question allow rapid assessment psychiatric history , current remission , ensure screen-out psychiatric exclusion . The HDRS-17 use screen current depression , characterize score &gt; 8 . Administration HDRS repeat end double-blind treatment . The MMSE , brief measure cognitive functioning ass arithmetic , memory orientation , screen current cognitive impairment . Physical Examination Monitoring : A general physical examination conduct baseline end treatment . Vital sign ( e.g . blood pressure , pulse , temperature , body weight ) assess in-person study visit . Individual energy ( kilocalorie ) expenditure per day assess use self-report questionnaire ( Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall Scale Food Frequency Questionnaire ) . In addition , subject complete Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index , Memory Function Questionnaire ( assess subjective cognitive complaint ) baseline final visit , well report frequency alcohol nicotine use . All information use adjust difference experimental variable two experimental group baseline course double-blind treatment . Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) : After overnight fast , subject give oral glucose challenge , wherein plasma glucose concentration measure baseline , T30min , T60min , T90min , T120min 75gm oral glucose load . Individuals fast glucose 100-125 mg/dl and/or 2-hour glucose 140-199 mg/dL le 200 mg/dL eligible study enrollment . OGTT repeat end study . Oral Cortisol Swabs : The participant ask take oral cortisol measure 3 day wake , 30 minute wake 9pm . These measure take baseline final follow . Genotyping APOE : If subject consent collection buffy coat sample , do collection blood blood screening test . The amount blood require buffy coat sample approximately 2-3 teaspoon . The subject right withdraw consent test time affect ability participate research study . The sample store minus 80 freezer long , limit 5 year . We use sample purpose without subject 's specific permission . Genetic analysis conduct experienced laboratory technician supervision Dr. Joachim Hallmayer . Blood genotyping ( approximately 6ccs ) drawn time eligibility screening , informed consent . Genotype result release participant . Blood sample label unique subject identifier know PI 's research staff . Genotyping APOE primary genetic analysis perform accord restriction isotyping protocol Hixson Vernier . Two observer blind clinical status individual carry assignment genotype . Structural Functional MRI : Scans acquire 3.0T GE magnet baseline upon 12-week follow-up Stanford Center Cognitive Neurobiological Imaging ( CNI ) . Both structural functional brain imaging conduct , total scan time 1 hour . All scan examine neuroradiologist detect presence unanticipated structural lesion , include tumor , infarct , abnormality sign vascular injury . Data subject abnormality exclude analysis contact refer clinical scan . We expect less 10 % scan exclude basis . Cognitive Testing : Cognitive testing conduct subject baseline 12-week follow-up . The battery include measure expect sensitive subtle change cognitive function , well instrument appear value prospectively identify individual risk cognitive decline and/or dementia . Specifically , measure work memory , memory recall , verbal fluency , executive function , motor function use detect early functional cognitive change commonly see MCI . The following battery test take approximately 90 minute ( baseline 12-week follow-up ) complete administer afternoon avoid diurnal effect : Auditory Consonant Trigrams ; Benton Visual Retention Test 5th Edition , Boston Naming Test , Buschke-Fuld Selective Reminding Test , Delis Kaplan Executive Function System ( DKEFS ) , Color-Word subtest , DKEFS Tower Test , DKEFS Trail Making Test , DKEFS Verbal Fluency subtest , Purdue Pegboard , Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test , Taylor Complex Figure Task , Wechsler Abbreviated Scale Intelligence , Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd Edition . Double-Blind Intervention : Following completion baseline assessment , volunteer randomly assign one two 12- week intervention ; double-blind placebo injection liraglutide 12 week . Subjects start subcutaneous morning dose 0.6 mg , titrate 1.2 mg one week , titrate 1.8 mg one week remain dose duration study ( see Table 1 ) . Subjects thoroughly instruct self-administer subcutaneous injection . Any subject tolerate high dose , 1.8 mg due side effect allow return 1.2 mg duration study . This dose schedule base evidence even low dose show improve glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes , whereas high amount use study estimate make insulin secretion insulin sensitivity . Subjects weekly phone visit clinical research coordinator first month , every two week remainder intervention . These call include adverse event assessment . This assessment provide study 's investigator endocrinologist , Dr. Sun Kim , order determine patient dose . We follow dose change patient within 48 hour discuss change . Dr. Kim meet patient additional follow dosing require . After 12 week treatment , baseline evaluation repeat . Anyone drop study replace . All subject unblinded upon completion treatment drop-out study . Open label treatment offer .</detailed_description>
