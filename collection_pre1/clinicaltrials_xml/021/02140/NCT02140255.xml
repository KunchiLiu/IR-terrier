	<detailed_description>IMPAACT P1115 explore effect early intensive ART achieve HIV remission ( HIV RNA limit detection detection PCR assay ) among infant infect HIV utero . Infants study initiate ART within 48 hour birth first evaluate determine whether HIV RNA detect blood ART . Upon reach two year age , infant undetectable HIV RNA evaluate determine meet study criterion stop take ART . Infants meet criterion stop take ART monitor closely determine whether HIV RNA remain undetectable ART . For infant stop ART HIV RNA detect , ART re-started .
