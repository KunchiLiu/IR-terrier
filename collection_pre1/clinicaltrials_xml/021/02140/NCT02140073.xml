	<detailed_description>Study design . Primary secondary endpoint Primary endpoint : • reduce incidence severity heartburn 8 week treatment Omez-DSR preparation comparison OMEZ preparation . Secondary endpoint : - reduce severity heartburn estimate visual analog scale 8 week treatment ; - incidence event heartburn 4 8 week treatment ; - proportion patient completely jugulated heartburn 4th 8th week treatment ; - number day without heartburn 4 week treatment ; - proportion patient resolve esophagitis 8 week treatment subject esophagitis time enrollment . Safety endpoint : - incidence adverse event group patient receive least one dose medicinal product randomization ; - incidence serious adverse event ; - incidence severe adverse event ; - incidence adverse event definitely cause administration test medicinal product . Description trial plan By design trial randomize open comparative parallel study . Study flow chart : Screening= &gt; Randomization= &gt; Group 1 ( Omez-DSR ) , Group 2 ( Omez ) = &gt; Treatment= &gt; Monitoring 13.3 . Phases trial : 1 . Screening - preliminary selection subject accord clinical criterion ; sign informed consent ; prescription conduction screening procedure ; decision inclusion/exclusion subject trial ground result screen procedure accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . 2 . Randomization - random distribution subject include trial two group : group 1 - treatment test Omez-DSR preparation , group 2 - treatment comparator Omez . 3 . Treatment - patient receive either Omez-DSR preparation Omez preparation prescribe regimen accord randomization number . Treatment shall ambulatory ; patient shall visit research center specify period . 4 . After end treatment patient shall return usual lifestyle , monitor assess efficacy therapy conduct record adverse event . Description measure allow reduce bias factor Randomization Randomization phase 2 shall perform use WinPepi statistical program , option Masking Partial mask shall use . Assessment endoscopic examination week 8 treatment shall blind ; specialist conduct endoscopy shall know therapy use . Statistical analysis shall perform cod subject ; analysis shall know group receive Omez-DSR , one - Omez . Description treatment Medical preparation authorize Republic Belarus shall use trial : Omez-DSR Omez . Dosage Dosage shall perform accordance label recommendation Omez-DSR Omez preparation . Dose Omez shall 2 capsules/day ( 40 mg omeprazole ) . Dose Omez-DSR shall 2 capsules/day ( 40 mg omeprazole 60 mg domperidone ) . Regimen Medicinal preparation shall prescribe randomization . Group 1 OM-DP : subject group shall supply preparation enough 8 week treatment . Group 2 OM : subject shall supply preparation enough 8 week . Features phase trial Signing inform consent : Screening , Assessment inclusion/exclusion criterion : Screening , Randomization Complaints Screening , Randomization , Week 8/End treatment , Monitoring After 28 day Past present history : Screening , Randomization Drug history : Screening , Week 8/End treatment , Monitoring After 28 day Physical examination : Screening , Randomization , Week 8/End treatment , Monitoring After 28 day Height , weight measurement : Screening , Week 8/End treatment , Monitoring After 28 day Survey GERD-Q scale ( value 7 score ) : Screening , Week 8/End treatment Distribution diary : Randomization Esophagogastroduodenoscopy : Screening , Week 8/End treatment Pregnancy test : Screening Distribution preparation : Randomization Recording adverse event : Week 8/End treatment , Monitoring After 28 day Compliance assessment : Week 8/End treatment</detailed_description>
