Both method tummy tuck meet acceptable standard care , aesthetic outcome negatively impact either option . Before surgery , procedure call lymphoscintigraphy performed . Lymphoscintigraphy special type imaging dye , call radiotracer , inject detect special camera . The picture provide lymphoscintigraphy allow investigator look lymphatic system , small network similar blood vessel help drain extra fluid . The lymphoscintigraphy help investigator know method perform tummy tuck leave lymphatic system intact . In addition , photograph patient 's abdomen take use special camera allow investigator put photographs computer compile 3-dimensional image . Investigators able look volume change swell surgery use picture . Finally , ultrasound use help identify seromas , fluid collection , may form surgery . The lymphoscintigraphy , photograph ultrasound combine help determine whether leave thicker thinner layer tummy tuck help preserve fluid drain lymphatic system whether effect recovery procedure .</brief_summary>
