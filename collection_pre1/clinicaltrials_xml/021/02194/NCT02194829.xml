	<brief_summary>This partially randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 give together paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride well work treat patient previously untreated pancreatic cancer spread another place body remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride effective without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 treating patient pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity combination therapy nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) , gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) AZD1775 ( WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 ) patient treatment-naive metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas locally-advanced adenocarcinoma pancreas surgically resectable . ( Phase I ) II . To determine dose AZD1775 use combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine chemotherapy phase II portion trial . ( Phase I ) III . To determine pharmacokinetics AZD1775 combination nab-paclitaxel gemcitabine . ( Phase I ) IV . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) associate nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 patient metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) associate nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 patient metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) associate nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 patient metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate disease control rate ( CR + PR + stable disease [ SD ] ) associate nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 patient metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability AZD1775 inhibit Wee1 increase deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage tumor cell death combine nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine compare nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate biomarker change tumor tissue associate Wee1 inhibition may also present hair follicle . ( Phase II ) III . To evaluate change tumor fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) uptake ( maximum standardize uptake value [ SUVmax ] ) baseline FDG-positron emission tomography ( PET ) week 4 FDG-PET predictor response use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) reference standard response . ( Phase II ) IV . To evaluate change tumor FDG uptake ( SUVmax ) baseline FDG-PET week 4 FDG-PET predictor progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) V. To compare change tumor FDG uptake ( SUVmax ) baseline FDG-PET week 4 FDG-PET patient treatment arm C D. ( Phase II ) VI . To evaluate early increase tumor fluorothymidine ( FLT ) uptake ( FLT-flare ) observe within 24 hour initiation treatment nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/placebo . ( Phase II ) VII . To evaluate early ( within 24 hour [ h ] ) increase tumor FLT uptake ( FLT-flare ) abrogate initiation treatment nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine/AZD1775 . ( Phase II ) VIII . To compare change tumor FLT uptake ( SUVmax ) baseline 24 hour initiation treatment patient treatment arm C D. ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 follow randomized phase II study . Patients phase I assign arm A B patient phase II randomize arm C D. ARM A ( PHASE I , DOSE LEVEL 1 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Patients also receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally ( PO ) daily day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . ARM B ( PHASE I , DOSE LEVEL 2 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , gemcitabine hydrochloride , WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 Arm A . ARM C ( PHASE II , PLACEBO ) : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation gemcitabine hydrochloride Arm A . Patients also receive placebo PO daily day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . ARM D ( PHASE II , WEE1 INHIBITOR MK-1775 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , gemcitabine hydrochloride , WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 Arm A . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
