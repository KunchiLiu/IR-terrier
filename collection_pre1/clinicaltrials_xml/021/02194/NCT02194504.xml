	<brief_summary>In Belly Fat study , effect two different caloric-restricted diet metabolic health examine male female subject increase abdominal adiposity ( BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2 ) . Metabolic health define health primary metabolic organ liver , gut adipose tissue , examine static state well application challenge test . The diet equally caloric-restricted , differ nutrient composition . It hypothesize one two diet cause large improvement organ health reduction liver fat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Belly Fat Study : Nutritional Intervention Improve Metabolic Health Subjects With Increased Abdominal Adiposity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : It know particular visceral fat ( abdominal obesity ) fat deposition non-adipose tissue liver important factor relate metabolic health , degree insulin resistance , dyslipidaemia well-established cardio-metabolic risk factor . The arise pathological consequence abdominal obesity result disturbance elegant interplay metabolic organ , liver , adipose tissue gut . Several nutrient demonstrate exert positive negative effect health function metabolic organ . A diet ( whole dietary approach ) thus power tool improve health status individual abdominal obesity improve organ health . Objective : The primary objective study compare effect two different diet static metabolic health status assess determination organ health , specifically , lipid accumulation liver . The application mixed meal challenge test use gain insight dynamic metabolic health status . A secondary objective determine reaction ( brain activity ) individual abdominal obesity visual olfactory food-cues . Study design intervention : Randomized , parallel design consist three group : 1 . 40 subject , 12-wk nutritional intervention base dietary advice : diet 30 % caloric restriction Western style nutrient composition 2 . 40 subject , 12-wk nutritional intervention base dietary advice : diet 30 % caloric restriction nutrient composition aim improve organ health reduce liver fat 3 . 30 subject , control group , nutritional intervention ( optional : dietary advice end study period ) Measurements metabolic health conduct baseline 12-wk intervention include : - MR image determine body fat distribution - MR spectroscopy quantification liver fat - Blood sampling ( plasma PBMCs ) several timepoints mixed meal challenge - Adipose tissue sample mixed meal challenge - Vascular measurement mixed meal challenge - Urine feces sample Study population : Males female , 40-70 yr old , BMI &gt; 27 kg/m2</detailed_description>
