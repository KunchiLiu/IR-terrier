	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial study overall tumor response vaccine therapy patientswith previously untreated Stage III IV , asymptomatic , non-bulky follicular lymphoma . The vaccine contain extract patient 's cancer cell immunostimulant protein , interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . It hop injected skin , vaccine enable patient 's immune system recognize destroy cancer cell . The trial also assess safety vaccine , time vaccine treatment patient require another type anti-lymphoma treatment , progression-free survival , anti-tumor immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oncoquest-L Vaccine Patients With Previously Untreated Stage III IV , Asymptomatic , Non-bulky Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm open-label pilot Phase II study . Following informed consent , eligible subject undergo excisional biopsy lymphoma-containing lymph node diagnosis generation Oncoquest-L vaccine . Patients receive subcutaneous injection consist autologous tumor-derived Oncoquest-L vaccine start approximately 4 8 week biopsy . The first two dos give 2-week interval remain 3 dos monthly interval . Patients monitor response perform image study baseline 1 month fifth vaccination ( Week 19 ) . Additional imaging study perform every 3 month first year every 6 month second year relapse disease progression whichever occur sooner .</detailed_description>
