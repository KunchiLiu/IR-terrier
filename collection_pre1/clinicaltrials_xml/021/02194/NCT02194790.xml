	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) major health problem Thailand . Previous study demonstrate integrated pre-dialysis care may slow decline renal function ( Nephrol Dial Transplant.2009 Nov ; 24 ( 11 ) :3426-33 ) . It interest know whether early intervention especially high risk group like Diabetic may also improve outcome patient primary health care set result delay CKD progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct 12-month longitudinal study district A ( control ) B ( intervention ) Kamphaeng Phet Province , Thailand . Diabetic patient eGFR â‰¥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 recruit district . Patients district A ( control group ) receive standard CKD care accord NKF-K/DOQI guidelines1 whereas district B ( intervention ) receive , addition standard care , educational activity provide nutritionist , pharmacist physiotherapist , quarterly home visit . Our home visit team consist nurse , health care officer village health volunteer . During hospital visit group clinical data assess . All laboratory parameter collect every 3 month , LDL HbA1C every 6 month . The primary end point rate eGFR decline . Secondary outcome random urine albumin creatinine ratio ( ACR ) , blood pressure , waist circumference , HbA1C LDL .</detailed_description>
