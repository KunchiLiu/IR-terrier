	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess dietary protein requirement clinically stable maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) patient . It hypothesize average dietary protein intake ( DPI ) maintain nitrogen balance 1.00 g protein/kg/day , safe intake maintains balance almost MHD patient 1.25g protein/kg/day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A high proportion maintenance hemodialysis ( MHD ) patient protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) powerful predictor high morbidity mortality . Although inflammation may contribute PEM , low dietary protein intake ( DPI ) often contribute factor . The usual DPI MHD patient 1.0 g protein/kg/day , whereas expert group recommend = 1.20 g protein/kg/day . However , recommendation base upon study , often insufficient duration , usually carry obsolete type dialysis therapy . We examine response different level dietary protein intake ( 0.6-1.3 g protein/kg/day ) classical balance technique carefully control dietary intake , living , condition , collection nitrogen output carefully measure nitrogen intake output .</detailed_description>
