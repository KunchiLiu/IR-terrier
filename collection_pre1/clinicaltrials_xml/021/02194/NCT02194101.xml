	<brief_title>Supernormal Goal Proximal Femur Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Augmentation oxygen delivery use fluid without inotropes show improve surgical outcome high-risk patient . Patients proximal femoral fracture consider high risk . However , cohort elderly patient poor cardiovascular condition may achieve oxygen delivery goal . We perform observational pilot study whether supernormal oxygen delivery valid hemodynamic goal patient proximal femoral fracture .</detailed_description>
