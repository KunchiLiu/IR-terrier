	<brief_summary>Schistosomiasis increasingly encounter among traveller return tropic know focal endemicity , associate presence snail intermediate host fresh water . Because schistosomiasis traveller often atypical asymptomatic due low intensity infection , many infection likely go undiagnosed develop chronic schistosomiasis . Conventional treatment schistosomiasis traveller praziquantel 40mg/kg daily dose know modest success rate . Diagnosis schistosomiasis relies egg detection , poor sensitivity low burden infection , serology , inadequate monitor cure . The department parasitology Leiden University Medical Center develop novel diagnostic test base up-converting phosphor technology ( UCP ) detect circulate anodic antigen ( CAA ) . This test perform serum urine detect low intensity schistosomiasis infection confirm cure praziquantel treatment . This study assess performance UCP-CAA traveller high-risk water contact .</brief_summary>
