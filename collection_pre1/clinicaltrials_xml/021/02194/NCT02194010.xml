	<brief_title>Disability Severity Scale ( DSI ) Hereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathy Overall Disability Scale ( HMSN-R-ODS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Charcot Marie Tooth Disease ( CMT ) group disorder cause peripheral neuropathy , impair long nerve go foot hand . Due problem peripheral nerve , people CMT muscle weakness sensory loss impairs physical ability . CMT affect approximately 1 2500 people cause mutation 70 different gene . Models exist many sub-types CMT lead increase understanding biological basis disorder . These advance also make rational therapy CMT realistic possibility . However , clinical trial limit CMT combination lack natural history data many subtypes , lack outcome measure detect change short period slowly progressive form CMT , lack outcome measure young child CMT . In order develop treatment base biological advance inherit neuropathy , necessary measure natural history various disorder . It know natural history one understand onset clinical symptom , rate progression , ultimate prognosis disease . For reason , INC dedicate much effort develop sensitive outcome instrument , include PRO tool , measure natural history CMT . It investigators goal establish instrument overall impairment use natural history analysis clinical trial . To develop validate instrument , investigator ask people CMT complete two questionnaire , DSI HMSN-R-ODS . These relate overall symptom impairment due CMT . These instrument may use help u understand overall progression CMT ultimately help clinical trial available various form CMT .</detailed_description>
