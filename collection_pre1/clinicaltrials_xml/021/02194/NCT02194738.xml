	<brief_title>Genetic Testing Screening Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Been Will Be Removed Surgery ( The ALCHEMIST Screening Trial )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To centrally test resect non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) genetic mutation facilitate accrual randomize adjuvant study . II . To obtain clinically annotated tumor tissue patient-matched non-malignant deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) peripheral blood , well detailed epidemiologic clinical follow-up data , allow clinically annotate advanced genomic analysis concert National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Center Cancer Genomics ( CCG ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize natural history molecularly characterize NSCLC allow subsequent development target therapy genotype-defined subpopulation adjuvant recurrent setting . II . To cross-validate local genotyping assay epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) central reference standard . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study genomic evolution lung cancer compare genomic characteristic resection recurrence . II . To understand reason behind lack enrollment adjuvant target therapy study potentially eligible patient . OUTLINE : Patients undergo collection blood tissue sample EGFR , ALK , program cell death protein 1 ( PD-1 ) /programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) /cytotoxic t-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ( CTLA-4 ) test via direct sequencing , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . Patients surgery prior pre-registration submit sample previous surgery testing . After completion study , patient enrol either A081105 , E4512 , EA5142 follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
