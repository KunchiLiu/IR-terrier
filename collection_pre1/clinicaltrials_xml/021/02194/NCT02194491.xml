	<brief_title>A Positron Emission Tomography Occupancy Study Using Ligand 11CAS2471907 Following Oral Dosing ASP3662</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-part study Part 1 ass test/retest variability ligand ( [ 11C ] AS2471907 ) . Part 2 assess level time-course enzyme occupancy follow ASP3662 dose . Subjects confine clinic 2 day .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Subject nonAsian descent . Subject body mass index ( BMI ) range 18.5 32 kg/m2 , inclusive weighs least 50 kg screening . Subject female spouse/partner childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception1 consist 2 form birth control ( least one must barrier method ) start screen continue throughout study period 90 day final study drug administration . Subject must donate sperm start screening , throughout study period least 90 day final study drug administration . Subject agree participate another investigational study study treatment . Subject know suspected hypersensitivity ASP3662 , [ 11C ] AS2471907 intolerance drug mechanism action ASP3662 . Subject allergy topical anesthetic , , lidocaine ( used catheter placement ) . Subject previously participate clinical study ASP3662 part 1 current study . Subject liver enzyme ( aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , alanine transaminase [ ALT ] , alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] , gammaglutamyl transferase [ GGT ] ) total bilirubin ( TBIL ) upper limit normal ( ULN ) . If liver enzyme &gt; 1 x ULN â‰¤ 1.5 x ULN , assessment may repeat screen period checkin . If repeat assessment ULN , exclusionary . If initial value &gt; 1.5 x ULN , repeat exclusionary . Subject clinically significant history allergic condition . Subject history suicide attempt suicidal behavior . Subject history smoking within past 6 month . Subject history evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , gastrointestinal ( GI ) , endocrinologic , hematologic , hepatic , immunologic , metabolic , urologic , pulmonary , neurologic , dermatologic , psychiatric , renal and/or major disease malignancy , judge investigator designee . Subject has/had febrile illness symptomatic viral , bacterial ( include upper respiratory infection ) fungal ( noncutaneous ) infection within 1 week clinic checkin . Subject clinically significant abnormality follow investigator 's review physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) protocoldefined clinical laboratory test screen clinic checkin . Subject mean pulse &lt; 40 &gt; 90 beat per minute ; mean systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg mean diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg ( measurement take triplicate subject rest supine position 10 minute ) screening . If mean pulse mean systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) mean diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) range specify , 1 additional triplicate measurement may take screening . Subject mean QTcF interval &gt; 430 msec screen checkin . If mean QTcF exceed limit , 1 additional triplicate ECG take screening . If triplicate also give abnormal result , subject exclude . Subject history unexplained syncope , cardiac arrest , unexplained cardiac arrhythmia torsade de pointes , structural heart disease family history Long QT Syndrome . Subject use prescribe nonprescribed drug ( include vitamin , natural herbal remedy , e.g. , St. John 's wort ) 2 week study drug administration , except occasional use acetaminophen ( 2 g/day ) . Subject history consume 14 unit alcoholic beverage per week within 6 month prior screen history alcoholism drug/chemical substance abuse within past 2 year prior screen ( Note : 1 unit = 12 ounce beer , 4 ounce wine 1 ounce spirits/hard liquor ) subject test positive screen clinic admission alcohol drug abuse ( amphetamine , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cannabinoids , cocaine opiate ) . Subject use drug abuse within 3 month screen checkin . Subject use inducer metabolism ( e.g. , barbiturate , rifampin ) 3 month prior checkin . Subject consume caffeinecontaining product within 24 hour prior admission grapefruit star fruit within 7 day prior admission . Subject significant blood loss , donate equal 1 unit ( 450 mL ) blood receive transfusion blood blood product within 60 day donate plasma within 7 day checkin . Subject positive serology test hepatitis B surface antigen , antihepatitis A virus ( Immunoglobulin M ) , antihepatitis C virus antihuman immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Type 1 Type 2 screening . Subject participate interventional clinical study treat investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , initiation screening . Subject employee Astellas Group vendor involve study . Additionally , subject meet follow image exclusion criterion include study : Subject suffers claustrophobia . Subject receive diagnostic therapeutic radiopharmaceutical within 7 day prior participation study . Participation research study involve ionize radiation within 1 year PET scan would cause subject exceed US Nuclear Regulatory Commission yearly dose limit healthy subject , i.e. , effective dose 5 Roentgen equivalent man ( rem ) receive per year . Subject history IV drug use would prevent venous access PET tracer injection . Severe motor problem prevent subject lying still PET image . Subject chronic pain reason ( e.g. , result rheumatoid arthritis ) . Subject MRI scan deem structurally abnormal investigator thus preclude proper identification region interest ( ROIs ) ( e.g. , cortical atrophy ) . The MRI scan individual subject may omit required anatomical MRI scan subject file perform within approximately 6 month prior dose , part participation approve Yale Protocol . Subjects current , past anticipated exposure radiation work place .</criteria>
