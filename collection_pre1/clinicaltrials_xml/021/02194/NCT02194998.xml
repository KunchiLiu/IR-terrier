	<brief_summary>HIV hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection disease share risk factor rout transmission . For reason , many people infect HIV also infect HCV . Interferon ( IFN ) drug use treat HCV ; however , people coinfected HIV HCV , IFN treatment often work well cause unwanted side effect . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , effectiveness IFN-free HCV treatment HIV/HCV coinfected adult take antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Interferon-Free Treatment Hepatitis C Virus Infection HIV-Coinfected Adults Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety , tolerability , effectiveness combination drug treat HCV adult coinfected HIV HCV . The three drug paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir ( PTV/r/OBT ) , dasabuvir ( DSV ) , ribavirin ( RBV ) . RBV give participant HCV genotype 1a ; participant HCV genotype 1b receive RBV . This study enroll HCV genotype 1a 1b HIV-1 coinfected participant ( HCV treatment-naïve HCV treatment-experienced ) concurrent integrase inhibitor ( INI ) -based ( raltegravir [ RAL ] dolutegravir [ DTG ] ) protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based ( darunavir [ DRV ] atazanavir [ ATV ] ) ART regimen . ( The ART regimens provide study . ) The participant assign one four cohort ( Cohorts A , B , C , D ) . Participants Cohorts A B INI-based ART ; participant Cohorts C D , PI-based ART . For group , study proceed two step : Step 1 : on-HCV treatment Step 2 : post-HCV treatment follow-up . Participants Cohorts A C receive HCV drug 24 week ; participant Cohorts B D , 12 week . Total study duration 48 week . During Step 1 ( on-HCV treatment ) , participant study visit Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 . Participants Cohorts A C additional Step 1 study visit Weeks 16 , 20 , 24 . All participant Step 2 ( post-treatment follow-up ) study visit 4 , 12 , 24 week registration Step 2 . Participants Cohorts B D additional Step 2 visit 36 week registration Step 2 . All study visit include brief physical exam blood collection . Select study visit include pregnancy test participant able become pregnant , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , IFN gamma-induced protein 10 ( IP-10 ) test , collection plasma sample . Some participant may take part optional substudy . Participants substudy attend two study visit entry/Day 0 Week 4 12-hour intensive pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sampling .</detailed_description>
