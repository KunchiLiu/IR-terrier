	<brief_summary>This pilot study collaboration Weill Cornell Medical College , Department Genetic Medicine Yale University examine pathway involve allergic response , primarily food allergy ; specifically peanut allergy.We also study non-allergic donor well patient atopic disorder , primarily control subjects.We believe study lead discovery significant pathway involve allergic pathway explored detail follow-up study order address mechanistic question answer pilot trial . We believe pilot study represent ideal approach identify effective therapeutic intervention simultaneously well understand underlying mechanistic property involve allergy cascade . We think study form basis novel avenue research pathogenesis allergic pathway , disease still associate significant morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study aim characterize pathway involve allergic response , primarily food allergy ; specifically peanut allergy . We also study non-allergic donor well patient atopic disorder , primarily control subject . All eligible study participant document elevated total IgE level , peanut positivity another antigen/allergen specific elevate IgE ( ie common indoor/outdoor allergen ) prior enrol study.Our study focus allergic well non-allergic individual . We plan collect sample total 80 patient one time point ( peanut allergic individual , non-atopic/allergic individual , atopic individuals-other peanut allergy ) . We believe pilot study represent ideal approach identify effective therapeutic intervention simultaneously well understand underlying mechanistic property involve allergy cascade . We plan obtain detailed history prior enrollment well objective data ( ie SPT well Immunocap test result ) . There 4 study group study perform approximately 20 peanut allergic patients,20 non-allergic control , 20 allergic ( non-peanut allergic , allergic indoor/outdoor allergen ) control well 20 patient currently xolair therapy ( control ) . There one blood draw require visit ( week 0 , 4 , 8 ) . Each blood draw require 105 ml whole blood collect ten heparinized 10-mL tube one EDTA tube . We plan assess level total IgE IgG well antigen specific IgG IgE peripheral blood patient . We specifically perform ELISA test detects level . We also perform vitro CD4+ T cell proliferation assay . For purpose , patient ' peripheral T cell isolated combination magnetic bead flow cytometric sorting .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1865 year age One follow group : Group 1 : Peanut allergic individual ( n : 20 ) Group 2 : Allergic/atopic individual ( allergic peanut ) ; ( n:20 ) Group 3 : Non allergic individual ( healthy control ; n:20 ) Group 4 : Allergic individual receive xolair therapy ( n : 20 ) Prior therapy antiIgE Steroid use great 10 mg/d prednisone equivalent 30 day prior enrollment Any immunosuppressive drug use within 3 month prior screen ( mycophenolatemofetil , hydroxychloroquine , azathioprine , methotrexate , leflunomide , rituximab , cyclophosphamide , intravenous immunoglobulin , plasmapheresis ) . Ongoing chronic infection ( viral , bacterial fungal ) include know HIV , Hepatitis B/C Acute infection receive antibiotic within 30 day prior screen Probiotics ( great estimate 109cfu organism per day ) within 30 day prior enrollment ( exception ferment beverage , milk yogurt ) . Malignancy within one year prior screening ( exception nonmetastatic squamous basal cell skin carcinoma cervical carcinoma receive curative surgical treatment ) Known illicit drug alcohol abuse Pregnancy</criteria>
