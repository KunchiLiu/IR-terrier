	<brief_summary>Gene transfer process DNA ( genetic material ) certain cell change . In study , gene transfer perform type white blood cell ( call T cell ) recognize leukemia cell person T cell collect . The goal clinical research study learn safe give genetically-changed T cell back patient CLL/SLL . Researchers also want learn cell help attack CLL/SLL cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard Blood Draw Leukapheresis ( collect T cell ) : If find eligible take part study , T cell collect blood . This do standard blood draw procedure call leukapheresis . Your doctor determine best method collect T cell . If blood collect standard blood draw , blood ( le 7 tablespoon ) draw 1-2 day use one needle stick arm . If go leukapheresis , may visit Apheresis Clinic MD Anderson . For leukapheresis procedure , need stay seat chair keep arm still 3 hour . Blood drawn 1 arm , white blood cell separate rest blood cell leukapheresis machine , red cell , platelet , plasma ( liquid part blood ) return arm . The leukapheresis procedure may require total 4-6 hour day 2 day . Your white blood cell sample send lab MD Anderson genetically-changed T cell grown lab . It take 4 week change grow enough genetically-changed T cell . If researcher unable create high enough dose T cell lab , may blood collect take study . You may treatment CLL/SLL wait production genetically-changed T cell . The study doctor discus possible method treatment . Study Groups : You assign level genetically-changed T cell base join study . Up 3 level genetically-changed T cell test . Up 6 participant enrol level . The first group participant receive small number T cell . Each new group receive high level group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable level genetically-changed T cell find , high level test reach ( whichever happen first ) . When high level find , additional 12 patient receive genetically- change T cell level . Chemotherapy : Within 4 5 day receive T cell infusion , receive 1 3 different FDA approve , standard combination chemotherapy , choose doctor . These combination give 2-3 day , must complete receive T cell . The day receive T cell refer negative day ( example , 5 day receive T cell call Day -5 ) . The drug combination know FCR , FBR , BR . If receive FCR , receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide vein , least 30 minute day Days -5 , -4 , -3 . You also receive rituximab vein least 4 hour Day -5 . If receive FBR , receive fludarabine bendamustine vein , least 30 minute day Days -5 , -4 , -3 . You also receive rituximab vein least 4 hour Day -5 . If receive BR , receive bendamustine vein least 30 minute day Days -4 -3 . You also receive rituximab vein Day -4 . No matter receive , rest 2 day receive nothing T cell infusion . T cell Infusion ( ) : Before infusion genetically-changed T cell , give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . You receive genetically-changed T cell 30 minute Day 1 . During infusion , vital sign ( include temperature , heart rate , blood pressure , breathe rate ) measure every 15 minute first hour , every 30 minute second hour , 1 hour . If still T cell leave infusion , intolerable side effect see first 4 week infusion , may receive second infusion . If , may also receive another course chemotherapy ( describe ) . Study Visits : About 14 day ( +/- 7 day ) receive T cell infusion : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test become pregnant . - Because gene transfer process use mouse antibody , may cause body make human antibody mouse-based antibody . These antibody call HAMA . Part routine blood sample describe use compare sample blood collect treatment complete , check develop immune system reaction mouse protein antibody . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw baseline research test study immune system respond receive T cell infusion . - If doctor think need , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , positron emission tomography - CT ( PET-CT ) scan , and/or bone marrow biopsy check status disease . The following test procedure perform within 24 hour T cell infusion , daily ( include weekend holiday ) first week infusion , 1 , 2 , 3 week ( +/-3 day ) , well 1 month ( +/- 5 day ) , 3 , 6 , 12 month ( +/- 14 day ) infusion : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample use check HAMA immune system reaction 1 , 2 , 3 week , well 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month T cell infusion . If leave study early , blood check HAMA time . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw research test study immune system respond T cell infusion . - If doctor think need , may need CT scan , PET-CT scan , and/or bone marrow biopsy check status disease ( 3 , 6 , 12 month last T cell infusion ) . Length Study : You may receive 2 T cell infusion , depend many T cell produce . You receive second T cell infusion disease get bad , intolerable side effect , difficulty follow study direction . Your participation study complete study visit 12 month last T cell infusion . Long-Term Follow-Up : For safety reason , FDA require patient receive infusion stem cell treat gene transfer procedure must long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . After receive infusion T cell ask sign separate consent form long-term follow-up name `` Long-Term Follow-Up Study Recipients Gene Transfer Research Protocols '' ( Protocol 2006-0676 ) . This investigational study . The chemotherapy drug study commercially available FDA approve . The gene transfer infusion genetically-changed T cell commercially available FDA approve use type disease . Their use study investigational . Up 48 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
