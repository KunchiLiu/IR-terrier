	<brief_title>Effects Healing Touch Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : I . To estimate effect heal touch ( HT ) vs usual care follow clinical outcome stem cell transplant ( SCT ) patient ; length hospital stay , day engraftment , number hospital readmission 100 day post-transplant . II . To estimate change quality life ( QoL ) occur hospitalization SCT patient receive HT vs. usual care . III . To examine difference effect HT vs. usual care ( UC ) patient receive related allogeneic ( Allo ) transplant compare receive autologous ( Auto ) transplant . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive daily HT session comprise pain drain , chakra connection , magnetic clearing , mind clear 30 minute day 1 2 day discharge hospital .
