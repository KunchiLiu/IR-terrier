Although clear evidence provide patient someone help manage/navigate health care system ( i.e. , patient navigation ( PN ) ) effective help complete cancer screening , hospital provide PN colonoscopy . The vast majority hospital NYC unable provide PN patient colonoscopy recommend , large part cost associate professional-led PN .

	<detailed_description>The overall goal study reduce CRC morbidity mortality increase African American participation colonoscopy . This do development implementation train program Peer Patient Navigation ( PPN ) increase participation African Americans colonoscopy . The primary care physician refer participant introduce study patient . The physician introduce patient Research Assistant/Recruiter immediately follow medical visit CRC screen colonoscopy recommend . The Research Assistant/Recruiter review study ask potential participant interested ; , candidate 's eligibility determine . If criterion meet patient want study , inform consent HIPAA review obtain . If patient want think his/her decision , inform consent obtain later date . Patients refer scheduled screening colonoscopy part standard care . Both group receive 3 intervention phone call assign navigator , 1 ) schedule colonoscopy , 2 ) call 2 week procedure , 3 ) third call three day procedure . For research purpose , participant randomize one two kind patient navigation : 1 . Standard patient navigation receive care would normally receive participate study navigation GI staff , three phone call involve schedule remind participant colonoscopy appointment . 2 . Peer Patient Navigation ( PPN ) : Participants assist African American peer undergone colonoscopy , able discus , first-hand , personal experience undergo colonoscopy describe cop effectively procedure . PPN 's underwent three month train supervise study investigator . Multiple modes training use ( didactic discussion , observation , role-playing , one-on-one session , ongoing feedback , rehearsal , supervision via review audio-tape record PPNs take-home training manual ) . A medical chart review complete colonoscopy patient assess completion examination well prep quality finding additional clinical follow-up require . Colonoscopy result also collect assess quality care measure effectiveness PPN navigation compare standard care , particularly potential difference base study group , i.e. , compliance .</detailed_description>
