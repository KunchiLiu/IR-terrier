	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose PI3K inhibitor BKM120 give together cisplatin etoposide treat patient advance solid tumor small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 cisplatin etoposide may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety feasibility combine BKM120 ( PI3K inhibitor BKM120 ) cisplatin etoposide advance solid tumor , emphasis small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine MTD ( maximally tolerate dose ) BKM120 combination cisplatin/etoposide . II . To describe dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) toxicity profile associate BKM120 combination cisplatin/etoposide . III . To determine preliminary efficacy BKM120 combination cisplatin/etoposide expand cohort patient SCLC . IV . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameter BKM120 combination . V. To collect blood sample future exploratory biomarker analysis . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BKM120 . Patients receive PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 , cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
