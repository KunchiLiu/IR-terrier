	<brief_summary>In US , racial ethnic disparity persist , even income , health insurance care access address . For example , great prevalence chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , high rate hospital use high death rate black compare white . This due many factor include : reduce healthcare access , high prevalence hypertension , coronary artery disease , systolic dysfunction , myocardial infarction obesity . Given magnitude chronic health issue , growth elderly population , increase ethnic diversity , provider need develop new way care chronic condition live health disparity community . The investigator propose implement randomize study health disparity community-dwelling patient . A bilingual clinician follow patient 3 month hospitalization CHF test approach propose health disparity population . The investigator obtain patient/caregiver input multiple point research make necessary adjustment intervention ensure disparity patient accept/use system , satisfy . To ensure propose outcome relevance patient , Community Advisory Board ( CAB ) stakeholder advise study team throughout study process . The investigator believe study patient use TSM 3 month period : 1 ) identify cost-effective care approach patient live chronic disease ; 2 ) involve patient identify test approach work ; 3 ) enhance provider-patient communication ; 4 ) teach patient self-monitor explore his/her role self-care ; 5 ) improve patient education treatment option 6 ) explore `` usable '' patient feel program . If goal achieve , strategy result patient-led improvement health , satisfaction quality life . Knowledge gain understanding use telehealth program effective self-management tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disparities cardiovascular disease receive particular focus , cardiovascular disease major contributor difference morbidity mortality black white . African Americans , example , hospitalize chronic heart failure ( CHF ) high rate white 30 % likely die CHF white individual . Community-dwelling patient CHF typically receive exacerbation-focused care , leading high rate emergency room ( ER ) hospital utilization . The lack comprehensive chronic disease management lead poor patient outcome , increase health care cost . Given large burden CHF unfavorable disease outcome disparity community , tailor focused management clinical condition warrant . We propose : 1 . Assess telehealth self management ( TSM ) usability , utilize mixed-methods approach , focus patient stakeholder input , goal adapt intervention facilitate acceptability feasibility population low-income ethnic minority patient . Prior intervention implementation , determine characteristic intervention require adaptation maximize usability focus group , key community stakeholder , patient caregiver . We continue qualitative usability assessment intervention patient enrol study identify barriers/challenges usability , adapt intervention . Finally , use quantitative method assess usability . These quantitative indicator also use make adjustment inform future wide-scale intervention conduct community . 2 . Compare hospital utilization low income ethnic minority patient receive telehealth technology vs. demographically match patient receive standard care . A randomized controlled clinical trial conduct test primary hypothesis health care utilization lower TSM group usual-care group . We specifically compare acute care ER utilization quality life ( Minnesota QoL Questionnaire ) group . We adjust potential confounders ( demographic , clinical , educational functional/support variable ) . The target population community-dwelling CHF patient discharge home Nassau University Medical Center . This research understand use TSM management CHF low income , ethnic minority senior . The propose research improve patient outcomes reduce unnecessary hospitalization ER burden . Chronic disease self-management program potential reduce health care cost improve patient health status , particularly medically underserved community .</detailed_description>
