	<brief_summary>The Lokomat robotic treadmill gait trainer use help people neurologic condition walk well . Early research child cerebral palsy ( CP ) show may help improve walk skill . The purpose two-group randomize study compare Lokomat training regular physiotherapy ( PT ) far impact walk ability relate function . The primary ( alternate ) hypothesis child improve Lokomat training term gross motor skill walk endurance . The investigator enrol 40 ambulatory child age 5 12 year , CP Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) Level II ( n=20 ) III ( n=20 ) . In crossover randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) , whether PT Lokomat intervention do first decide independent randomization process occur first baseline assessment . In Lokomat phase , child receive 8 10 week twice weekly therapy maximum 16 session . Each session 35 minute plus time need set-up . The 35 minute PT program also give twice weekly 8 10 week maximum 16 session , focus menu-based strength , co-ordination , fitness , walk balance activity . There 6 week break Lokomat PT intervention . Each child four study assessment ~6 month study . The first assessment do start Lokomat physiotherapy phase . The second happens first intervention finish . The child 6-week break period . The third assessment do end break , fourth occur second intervention . The PT assessor assessment PT give intervention . The assessor blind child 's intervention phase previous assessment result . The primary outcome measure Gross Motor Function Measure 6 minute walk test . Secondary measure evaluate gait , functional ability , participation , health relate quality life individualize goal . The randomized aspect study let u look outcome difference child Lokomat PT within first intervention phase ( n=20/group ) . The cross-over phase evaluate within-child outcome across two phase . A qualitative component concurrently underway examine child/parent experience view Lokomat outcome .</brief_summary>
