	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy Completely Resected Merkel Cell Carcinoma With 3 mg/kg BW Ipilimumab ( Yervoy® ) Versus Observation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) rare ( incidence 0.44 per 100,000 ) , highly aggressive form skin cancer . Indeed , MCC dramatically high mortality rate initial diagnosis malignant melanoma ( 37 vs. 15 percent ) . This high mortality rate largely due fact date establish adjuvant therapy completely resect MCC , none currently available therapeutic intervention able improve overall survival patient suffer metastatic disease . Consequently , new therapeutic strategy adjuvant well palliative setting need . Recently , European Commission grant clinical trial metastatic MCC within FP7 HEALTH2011.2.4.1-1 call . The present proposal aim use newly establish network investigate adjuvant immune therapy MCC . Epidemiologic data suggest approximately 2500 new MCC case per year within EU ( European Union ) , 1000 patient die disease . MCC usually affect elderly . The median age diagnosis 70 year , 5- 10-fold increase incidence age 70 compare age le 60 year . Thus , age European population impact deadly cancer increase . As compare cancer , MCC particularly link immune suppression . Indeed , 7.8 % MCC patient profoundly immune suppress , 16-fold over-representation MCC compare normal incidence . Notably , impact immune surveillance course MCC much pronounce melanoma : ratio melanoma MCC 60:1 normal population , 6:1 immune suppress population . Moreover , 20 report case complete spontaneous regression confirm MCCs , suggest ability immune system exert sudden immune recognition clearance tumor . Notably , regression may also induce cessation immune suppression . Another line evidence immunogenicity MCC observation , strong inflammatory infiltrate , particularly CD8+ T cell , within tumor associate favorable prognosis . The immunogenicity MCC explain recently recognize viral pathogenesis tumor entity . Indeed , preliminary data MCC research network suggest immune dominant T-cell epitope derive oncogenic virus elicit spontaneous immune response MCC patient . Consequently , immune modulating strategy particularly attractive therapy MCC . Ipilimumab/Yervoy® new therapeutic strategy target immune checkpoint ( CTLA-4 ) , provide significant benefit overall survival two phase III trial patient unresectable stage III stage IV melanoma . In adjuvant treatment melanoma , ipilimumab 10 mg/kg currently test patient clinical stage IIIA IIIC ( EORTC 18071 ; ECOG 1609 ) . Given well-established clinical benefit ipilimumab tumor like melanoma , moderately immunogenic , likely impact highly immunogenic tumor like MCC even impressive . Thus , adjuvant randomize phase III trial 3mg/kg ipilimumab patient completely resect MCC warrant . The immune related adverse event ipilimumab may severe case , well manageable steroid immunosuppressive drug , provide detect early . Although 10 mg/kg dose regimen show efficacious phase II trial stage IV melanoma patient ( CA 184-022 , CA184-008 , CA184-007 ) , 3 mg/kg regimen also provide clinical response much low rate severe adverse event . Indeed , 3 mg/kg dosage use one two positive phase III trial metastatic melanoma . Due safer toxicity profile , 3mg/kg ipilimumab probably best suitable adjuvant use patient completely resect MCC . Almost half patient completely resect MCC relapse loco-regional distant metastasis within first two year initial diagnosis highly immunogenic cancer . Consequently , immune modulate therapy ipilimumab ( Yervoy® ) likely improve disease-free survival well overall survival MCC patient give adjuvant setting .</detailed_description>
