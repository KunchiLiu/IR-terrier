	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cisplatin without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 work treat patient head neck cancer come back spread part body . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , may prevent tumor cell multiply damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) , turn stops tumor grow . WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether cisplatin effective without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 treating patient head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin With Without WEE1 Inhibitor MK-1775 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall response rate assess efficacy MK-1775 ( WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 ) combination cisplatin cisplatin alone patient recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) per overall response rate ( use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion version [ v ] 1.1 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess secondary measure efficacy ( progression free survival 6 month 12 month , overall survival rate 12 month ) . II . Assess measure efficacy tumor protein ( p ) 53 status . III . Evaluate safety tolerability . IV . Explore predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers . OUTLINE : SAFETY RUN-IN : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 5 dos begin day 1 cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO BID 5 dos begin day 1 cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID 5 dos begin day 1 cisplatin IV 2 hour day 1 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
