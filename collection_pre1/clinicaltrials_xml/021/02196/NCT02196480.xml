	<brief_summary>Objectives : To assess immunogenicity safety 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine ( PPV23 ) JIA patient without anti-TNF therapy . The influence demographic data , disease activity treatment immune response potential deleterious effect vaccine disease also evaluate . Methods : 17 JIA patient immediately pre-etanercept ( Group 1 ) 10 JIA patient stable dose methotrexate ( Group 2 ) receive one dose PPV23 . All patient evaluate pre-vaccination , 2 month 12 month post-vaccination seven pneumoccocal serotypes . Serology perform enzyme immunoassay immunogenicity endpoint include seroprotection ( SP ) , seroconversion ( SP ) geometric mean concentration antibody ( GMC ) . Clinical laboratorial parameter JIA evaluate vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>23-valent Polysaccharide Pneumococcal Vaccine Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Patients Under Anti-TNF Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seventeen JIA patient ( International League Against Rheumatism criterion ) follow Pediatric Rheumatology Unit Children 's Institute Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo refractory methotrexate [ median dose 0.9 mg/kg/week ( 0.7 - 1 ) ] include immediately association anti-TNF ( etanercept 0.8 mg/kg/week , Group 1 ) previous therapy . The control group ( Group 2 ) consist 10 JIA patient stable dose methotrexate [ median dose 0.8 mg/kg/week ( 0.3-1.0 ) ] . One intramuscular dose PPV23 ( Sanofi Pasteur ) , lot B0381-3 , immunization center hospital give study subject . Participants ≥ 5 ≤ 18 year old patient previous vaccination S. pneumoniae exclude . This study approve Local Ethical Committee University Hospital inform consent obtain participant legal guardian . Vaccine immunogenicity Blood sample collect pre-vaccination , 2 month 12 month post-vaccination 7 pneumoccocal serotypes ( 4 , 6B , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F ) . Samples centrifuge serum frozen store −70 ◦C test . In order eliminate non-specific antibody may exhibit cross-reactivity , sample pre-absorbed C-polysaccharide heterologous serotype 22F . Serology serotype perform enzyme immunoassay immunogenicity endpoint include seroprotection rate ( SP ) ( percentage subject achieve antibody titer ≥1.3 micrograms/mL ) , seroconversion rate ( SC ) ( percentage subject minimum 2-fold rise post-vaccination antibody titer ) geometric mean concentration antibody ( GMC ) . Adequate vaccine response consider SC occur least 50 % seven vaccine serotypes . During period one year PPV23 vaccination , upper low respiratory tract infection weekly record clinical appointment . Safety : The number participant local systemic adverse event assessed measure safety tolerability . Local reaction consider related PPV23 , systemic adverse event analyze individually determine causality . Severe adverse event define require hospitalization death . Clinical , laboratorial therapy assessment : All patient evaluate day vaccination , 2 month 12 month immunization clinical laboratorial parameter : number active joint ( swell within joint , limitation range joint movement joint pain tenderness ) , number limited joint , morning stiffness , patient physician global assessment arthritis activity measure pain score Visual Analog Scale '' ( VAS ) validate Brazilian version Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire ( CHAQ ) . Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) evaluate accord Westergreen method C-reactive protein ( CRP ) accord nephelometry . The Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score 27-joint reduce count ( JADAS-27 ) , define linear sum score 4 component [ physician global assessment disease activity ( measure 10-cm VAS ) , parent/patient global assessment well-being ( measure 10-cm VAS ) ; number active joint ( 0-27 joint ) ; ESR ] ( range : 0 - 57 point ) , calculate JIA patient . Current concomitant treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , prednisone , methotrexate , leflunomide cyclosporine evaluate . Statistical analysis : Immunogenicity safety analysis descriptive data present number ( % ) median ( range ) . The GMCs compare JIA patient without anti-TNF therapy use two-sided Student 's t-test Mann-Whitney U-test log10-transformed titer . The prospective analysis GMCs seven pneumococcal serotypes perform Friedman Repeated Measures ANOVA Ranks . Categorical variable ( rate seroprotection seroconversion , prednisone immunosuppressive drug use ) compare use Fisher 's exact test . The prospective analysis seroprotection seroconversion rate seven pneumococcal serotypes perform McNemar 's Test . The effect vaccination disease activity analyze Wilcoxon sign rank test . The statistical significance set p value &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
