High frequency TMS ( &gt; 1 Hz ) show activate whereas low frequency TMS ( &lt; 1Hz ) show inhibitory clinical neurophysiological study . TMS approve treatment depression patient respond trial least one antidepressant medication . The goal study translate knowledge learn neurophysiological study insomnia clinical treatment insomnia use TMS primary modality .
