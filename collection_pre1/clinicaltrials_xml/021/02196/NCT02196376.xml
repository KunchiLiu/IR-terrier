	<detailed_description>Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome poorly understood . Many patient elevated level plasma norepinephrine , particularly upright One subgroup patient primary hyperadrenergic state . The majority patient mark deficit plasma blood volume compare healthy control subject . The investigator previously report patient suffer paradoxically partial dysautonomia affect low limb . Most patient seem suffer either primary secondary increase central sympathetic nervous system drive . Recent data show patient postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome lower cardiac stroke volume healthy counterpart low stroke volume may drive orthostatic tachycardia . The investigator plan follow : The physical examination include ( minimum ) : - Height - Weight - Orthostatic vital sign ( heart rate blood pressure ) Supine Standing 10 minute - Beighton Criteria Joint Hypermobility Syndrome ( Ehlers-Danlos III ) - Dependent acrocyanosis ( stand test ) Continuous Heart Rate Blood Pressure Recording A subset subject give opportunity also continuous recording heart rate blood pressure 5-10 minute lie quietly . They instrument EKG patch body finger blood pressure cuff , data digitally sample acquire dedicate laptop computer later offline analysis . There optional rider consent form allow patient consent portion study . Blood work Blood drawn future assay analysis follow test : - Antibodies regulate cardiovascular function The clinical significance antibody unknown . The investigator share result antibody panel subject , caveat clinical interpretation comment significance make . - Inflammatory marker The total amount blood drawn project le 15 ml . Questionnaires - RAND-36 - Health Thermometer - Chandler Fatigue Scale - Daily diary Fatigue Symptoms - Fibromyalgia - Pain Detect Questionnaire - Orthostatic Grading Scale - COMPASS-31 - Structured History ( include element section 6.1 ) These questionnaire complete directly online ( web-based interface ) use personalize link provide subject give inform consent . These create REDCap-Survey environment , data collect stored password-protected , HIPAA-compliant , secure computer server .</detailed_description>
