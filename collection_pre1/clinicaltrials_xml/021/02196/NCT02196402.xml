	<brief_summary>Several report suggest endoscopic diagnosis adenoma , mean narrow band imaging ( NBI ) , might allow determination polyp management surveillance interval , particularly patient diminutive polyp ( &lt; 5mm ) , advance histological feature uncommon prevalence invasive cancer negligible ( 1 ) . On basis , American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ASGE ) set initiative evaluate applicability real-time endoscopic polyp assessment clinical practice ( 1 ) , state : 1. diminutive polyp resect discard without pathologic assessment , endoscopic technology ( use high confidence ) use determine histology polyp &lt; 5mm size , combine histopathologic assessment polyp &gt; 5 mm size , provide &gt; 90 % agreement assignment post-polypectomy surveillance interval compare decision base pathology assessment identify polyp . 2 . In order technology use guide decision leave suspect rectosigmoid hyperplastic polyp &lt; 5 mm size place ( without resection ) , technology provide &gt; 90 % negative predictive value ( use high confidence ) adenomatous histology This strategy could potentially exert significant impact colonoscopy practice , decrease extent pathology-associated cost , although related histological analysis &gt; 5mm polyp maintain . In recent study perform Centre ( 2 ) , restrict application resect discard strategy patient small diminutive polyp , achieve accordance endoscopy-directed histology-directed surveillance strategy 85 % population . This approach , decision patient management drive `` vivo '' endoscopic assessment , provide one hand slightly low accordance threshold 90 % set PIVI , one allow complete spare pathology relate cost , although small proportion patient . Moreover observe negative predictive value 86 % presence adenoma within diminutive polyp cohort , although separate analysis leave sided one perform . AIms single center , prospective , observational study : 1 . To prospectively evaluate accordance endoscopy-directed histology-directed surveillance strategy apply resect discard strategy diminutive polyp accord PIVI statement 2 . To assess economic impact resect discard strategy apply either accord PIVI statement restrictedly subject diminutive polyp 3 . To provide temporary validation diagnostic performance resect discard strategy group potential presence learn effect methodology 4 . Accordance endoscopists ' nurse ' categorization adenoma accord standardize criterion ( see )</brief_summary>
