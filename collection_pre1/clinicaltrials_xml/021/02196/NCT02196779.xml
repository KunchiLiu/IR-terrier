	<brief_title>Laser Fluorescent Imaging Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol Laser Fluorescent Imaging Abdominal Skin During Abdominoplasty . Background/Purpose Abdominoplasty ( tummy tuck ) common cosmetic operation . One risk surgery delay wound heal cause impaired circulation skin . In effort reduce risk , investigators1 advocate limited-undermining technique , preservation perforate blood vessel preservation Scarpa fascia low abdomen . However , evidence limited-undermining technique improve blood supply compare traditional abdominoplasty dissection . Such limited dissection may compromise cosmetic result . This study undertaken investigate blood supply abdominal skin abdominoplasty procedure . By test circulation two point dissection , third time completion operation , data may obtain use evaluate effect extent dissection blood supply skin flap . Laser fluorescent image represent objective measurement technique use quantitate blood supply skin flap tissue . It use several year monitor vascularity flap use breast reconstruction . This technique also use previously patient undergo abdominoplasty.2 Subjects Twenty consecutive consent adult men woman undergo outpatient elective abdominoplasty investigate use laser fluorescent image . By test blood supply three time point , patient serf control . Imaging The SPY Elite Intraoperative Perfusion Assessment System ( Lifecell Corp. , Branchburg , NJ ) consist near-infrared laser detects fluorescence . The imaging agent , indocyanine green , absorbed region spectrum , 800-810 nm . The imaging agent inject intravenously . Starting within 5-10 second injection , system record image abdomen , show fluorescence , indicate blood supply . The half-life imaging agent 2.5-3 minute . The imaging agent metabolize liver . The know risk allergic reaction image agent . Patients history allergic reaction iodinate contrast dye exclude . Surgery The lipoabdominoplasty technique perform described Saldanha et al.1 Following limited dissection , 3 mL ( 7.5 mg ) indocyanine green inject abdominal image record , document blood supply low abdomen . After dissection , another 3 mL image agent inject low abdomen re-imaged . On completion surgery , third injection administer final image record . Null Hypothesis A traditional abdominoplasty dissection compromise circulation compare limited dissection technique . Informed Consent Patients informed nature study tell participation entirely voluntary free decline , way prejudice treatment . Patients inform small risk allergic reaction treat occurs . Patient Risk There patient risk apart small risk allergic reaction , reduce excluding patient know allergy iodinate contrast dye . The study affect patient treatment . It offer possibility detection reduce skin circulation , information use surgeon limit dissection necessary avoid tissue loss delay wound healing , know complication abdominoplasty . Sample Size A sample 20 patient anticipate , treated period approximately 6 month . Disclosure The author financial interest product , device , drug mention article . The author conflict interest disclose . There outside funding study .</detailed_description>
