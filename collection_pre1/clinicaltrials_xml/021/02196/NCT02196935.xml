	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography endoscopic ultrasound increasingly used manage complex disease bile duct , pancreas cancer . Gastroenterology patient Los Angeles County Hospital present unique diverse patient population . Our aim study biochemical , radiographic , clinical predictor bile duct stone . Exploratory aim include study management cholangitis , bile leak , GI cancer diagnosis management , management pancreaticobiliary problem underserved . All patient manage EUS ERCP LA County &amp; USC University Hospitals enrol databaseThe timing , clinical presentation , objective detail patient presentation record prospectively . Additionally result subsequent ERCP EUS procedure . Subsequent , clinical course pathology also record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIMS A ) Characterize unusual disease pathologic presentation require endoscopic treatment large safety net hospital B ) To study impact EUS ERCP management patient . C ) Analyze EUS ERCP result correlate radiographic method include conventional ultrasound compute tomography ( CT ) D ) Compare role EUS ERCP safety net versus tertiary care center II ) BACKGROUND Endscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) consist endscope contain high frequency transducer , become standard care evaluate gastrointestinal cancer well disease include chronic pancreatitis . EUS fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) demonstrate least invasive effective mean acquire tissue number situation include pancreas cancer maligant lymph node . Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) therapeutic procedure use manage choledocholithiasis , bile duct obstruction occasional pancreatic ductal problem . Its diagostic us limit advent EUS cross sectional radiographic study include CT magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) . A number lead ERCP/EUS group include University Alabama ( Birmingham , Alabama ) , Cleveland Clinic ( Cleveland Ohio ) Mayo Clinic ( Rochester , Minnesota ) develop ERCP/EUS database lead important insight role procedure disease use manage . However , group indeed almost entire world literature regard EUS ERCP focus America , Western European , Japanese population . The goal database study impact EUS ERCP underserved population LAC . The prevalence certain disease include cholangitis , large bile duct stone , gastric cancer markedly high institution western facility present unique opportunity report treat part standard management . IIIA ) DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY 1 . ALL PROCEDURES ARE DONE STRICTLY AS STANDARD OF CARE . 2 . Detailed collection sheet contain PHI detailed information laboratory , symptom , radiographic test , time presentation procedure detals prospectively complete patient undergo EUS ERCP Gastroenterology service USC Hospitals . The result pathology clinical course collect anonymized form . 3 . The information extraction sheet enter database strip personal health identifier . IIIB ) PLANNED DATA COLLECTION 1 . The aim project develop prospective database EUS/ERCP case USC . 2 . For ERCP EUS case detailed information regard presentation patient note . Specifically , radiographic biochemical marker clinical symptom interest . 4 ) For EUS outcome include confirmation biopsy image underlying pathology . 5 ) For ERCP outcomes procedural success specifically bile duct stone confirmation removal , treatment cholangitis , treatment leak biliary , decompression obstruction . Success anesthesia strategy aim collection . 6 ) For potential quality care assessment procedure complication success anesthesia strategy priori area study IV ) STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS As study involve creation database standard care management patient EUS ERCP primarily descriptive statistic use future study . If individual group compare ( ie positive versus atypical fine needle aspiration ) chi square versus statistic use analysis depend distribution..</detailed_description>
