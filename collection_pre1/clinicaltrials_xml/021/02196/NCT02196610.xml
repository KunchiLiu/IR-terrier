	<brief_summary>People kidney failure high chance get disease blood vessel result decrease elasticity artery body make stiff hard . It appear stiff artery decrease elasticity increase risk stroke heart disease . A novel way know stiffness blood vessel method call `` applanation tonometry '' , measure `` pulse wave velocity '' major blood vessel aorta , carotid femoral artery . The purpose study determine measure arterial stiffness reliably accurately use method healthy people people kidney failure receive hemodialysis treatment centre . Also , would like know stiff artery healthy people . If demonstrate method reliable accurate 2 group participant centre , future large study plan determine use measure arterial stiffness evaluate risk stroke heart disease people kidney failure receive hemodialysis . The research study take place Ottawa Hospital-Riverside Campus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Arterial Stiffness Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiovascular ( CV ) disease major cause morbidity mortality patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Arterial stiffness measure pulse-wave velocity ( PWV ) identify independent predictor fatal CV event patient . Our long-term goal study impact intervention decrease progressive arterial stiffness CV mortality ESRD patient . Thus , postulate measurement PWV intervention predict CV outcome . Before study relationship , establish feasibility PWV measurement centre necessary . Objectives : ) To demonstrate reliability accuracy arterial PWV measurement healthy subject patient ESRD centre , ii ) To assess subject satisfaction level discomfort associate testing procedure , iii ) To characterize normative value PWV two subject group , iv ) To determine feasibility recruitment patient ESRD , pre-requisite large trial focus CV outcome . Methods : PWV measure consecutively 2 research assistant : ) group 20 healthy subject ; b ) group 20 patient ESRD chronic hemodialysis The Ottawa Hospital . Two consecutive set PWV measurement time-interval 1 week ( ± 2 day ) obtain healthy ESRD group ( pre-hemodialysis , 2 consecutive mid-week hemodialysis session ) . To determine impact hemodialysis PWV measure , sub-group 10 ESRD subject measurements take hemodialysis . The order test 2 assistant randomize .</detailed_description>
