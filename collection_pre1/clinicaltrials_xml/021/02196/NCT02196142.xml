	<detailed_description>Background Alcohol dependence chronically relapse disorder major impact person psychological , physiological social functioning . There extensive evidence animal human study point important role addiction memory development maintenance disorder . Cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) proven high effectiveness treatment addictive disorder . A core element CBT exposure technique comparable extinction habituation learning . The repeated exposure alcohol relate cue absence alcohol ingestion lead extinction condition response , thus reduce probability relapse alcohol take behaviour . Studies show glucocorticoid impair memory retrieval healthy subject . In fact , investigator could show cortisol fear reduce effect patient post-traumatic stress disorder phobic patient , result particularly reduce symptom anxiety reduce stress reactivity . Interestingly enough , pharmacologically induce high level glucocorticoid lower subjective feeling anxiety stress situation activate per se HPA-axis . Further show combined therapy glucocorticoid administration exposition base psychotherapy lead good therapy outcome patient specific phobia . Objective The goal study examine acute effect glucocorticoid administration alcohol crave stress reactivity abstinent alcohol dependent patient . On basis clinical research anxiety disorder , investigator expect pharmacologically increase cortisol level may impair retrieval addiction memory , indicate less crave alcohol exposition , exposition therapy enhance consolidation corrective experience . Similar research anxiety patient , investigator aim examine whether cortisol administration could help improve effect exposition therapy patient alcohol dependence . The purpose decrease therapy duration cortisol administration addition already well proven therapy make therapy efficient well factor reduce healthcare cost . Methods Patients undergo two identical experimental session 6th 8th week ( one week ) 12-week inpatient treatment program alcohol dependence . The experiment take place experimental room clinic Südhang 1 6 pm . One hour confrontation alcohol associate stimuli patient receive either 20mg hydrocortisone placebo ( oral administration ) . The experiment consist computer base picture task ( alcoholic neutral picture ) in-vivo exposure task . Psychological ( crave , stress , arousal ) physiological ( heart rate , saliva cortisol ) parameter repeatedly measure course experiment .</detailed_description>
