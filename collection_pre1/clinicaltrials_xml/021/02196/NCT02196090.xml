	<detailed_description>1 . Background Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) condition associate recurrent intrusive distressing thought , image urge compel person perform neutralize act thought extent significantly interfere daily activity . The symptom OCD associate subjective objective sign distress . Psychophysiological study OCD anxiety disorder often report abnormal sympathovagal balance decrease parasympathetic vagal tone increase sympathetic tone ( Hoehn-Saric et al 1995 , Broderick et al 2013 , Kawano et al 2012 , Pittig et al 2013 , Buhlmann et al 2007 , Blechert et al 2007 , Friedman Thayer 1998 ) . The first line treatment OCD Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) include Exposure Response Prevention ( ERP ) patient test fear without respond compulsive act ( NICE Clinical Guideline 31 ) . ERP treatment often associate significant subjective distress ( Kellner et al 2012 ) dropout rate 20 % minimal improvement another 20 % patient ( Foa 2010 ) . Various modality treatment reduce subjective physiological distress use treatment anxiety disorder symptom ( Streeter et al 2012 , Miu et al 2009 , Gorman et al 2000 ) similar approach could increase rate improvement adherence ERP treatment OCD . Most attempts reduce distress anxiety focus re-establishing sympathovagal balance enhance vagal parasympathetic tone suggest reduce mobilization behaviour fight flight response improve emotion regulation ( Austin et al 2007 ) . Disgust emotion implicate significant role anxiety disorder OCD contamination fear ( Moretz McKay 2008 ) . It show limited response exposure therapy ( Olatunji et al 2009 ) associate increase avoidance reduce compliance exposure ( Olatunji et al 2007 ) possibly contribute poorer treatment outcome . Disgust associate change sympathovagal balance ( Ottaviani et al 2013 ) effect manoeuvre affect balance test . Vagal tonus increase specific procedure call vagal manoeuvre . These include dive reflex , Valsalva manoeuvre , pressure eyeball carotid sinus massage , dive reflex one effective ( Arnold 1999 ) . The diving reflex phylogenetically ancient physiological phenomenon believe facilitate survival immersion cold water bradycardia peripheral vasoconstriction redistribute blood flow vital organ ( Gooden 1994 ) . The combined bradycardia vasoconstriction effect indicate complex sympathovagal activation bradycardia believe due central vagal activation ( Stemper et al 2002 ) . The natural trigger dive reflex include change body position , apnoea sensation cold wet surface face cold sensation face sufficient induce vagal response . This believe transmitted ophthalmic branch trigeminal nerve achieve use cold compression cold face gel mask ( Khurana et al . 1980 ) . The physiological response dive reflex measure record standard physiological measure heart rate , blood pressure skin conductance . Heart rate interpretation term heart rate variability become frequently utilized evaluate balance sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system . Most frequently use frequency domain approach allow differentiate specific frequency band . The low frequency ( LF ) band group variability 0.05-0.15Hz believe represent sympathetic cardiac control slower unmyelinated nerve fibre high frequency ( HF ) band include frequency 0.15-0.4Hz reflect parasympathetic vagal control faster myelinated nerve fibre ( Berntson et al 1997 ) . 2 . Aims study The aim study evaluate effect simple vagal manoeuvre , cold face gel mask application , subjective measure Anxiety , Disgust , Strength belief obsession , Strength urge carry compulsion , Strength belief Theory A/B increase Feeling support , Readiness face fear ERP treatment OCD use single-case series experimental design explore relationship subjective measure sympathovagal balance measure heart rate variability . Our hypothesis : 1 . ERP application cold gel face mask ( Condition B ) associate fast reduction visual analogue scale Anxiety , Disgust , Strength belief obsession , Strength urge carry compulsion , Strength belief Theory A/B increase Feeling support , Readiness face fear compare ERP usual simply resist compulsive behaviour ( Condition C ) . 2 . Increase vagal tonus document heart rate variability measure correlate effect visual analogue scale Anxiety , Disgust , Strength belief obsession , Strength urge carry compulsion , Strength belief Theory A/B , Feeling support Readiness face fear . 3 . Methods . Participants : Participants recruit Anxiety Disorders Residential Unit ( ADRU ) , Bethlem Royal Hospital . All patient admit ADRU opportunity consent contact participate research study . Only patient admit ADRU treatment OCD provide initial consent approach Dr Roman Duncko regard write informed consent participate present study . ii . Procedure Design : On day study , therapy begin Baseline phase ( Condition A ) record psychological ( visual analogue scale Anxiety , Disgust , Belief obsession , Strength urge compulsion , Strength belief Theory A/B , Feeling support , Readiness face fear ) physiological measure ( HR record ) 3-5 consecutive 5min interval stable baseline measure achieve . After , participant proceed Intervention phase apply ERP use trigger identify individual hierarchy . Each ERP session follow structure first obtain session baseline 3 time point , exposure trigger continue prevent response apply cold face mask 5 minute ( Condition B ) without use face mask ( Condition C ) . Psychological physiological measure obtain 5 minute interval return session baseline . ERP session follow alternate order 4 session per day ( Day 1 : ABCBC , Day 2 : ACBCB , Day 3 : ABCBC ) . All baseline exposure measure record investigator accompany participant procedure . Cold face gel mask store refrigerator ADRU available participant require . iii . Psychological measure : Visual analogue scale measurement severity Anxiety , Disgust , Strength belief obsession , Strength urge carry compulsion , Strength belief theory A/B , Strength belief Theory A/B , Feeling support , Readiness face fear use participant time point specify . In addition participant assess clinical symptom ( YBOCS , OCI ) weekly basis part standard treatment plan . On last day study , participant ask complete Client Satisfaction Questionnaire base ( Larsen et al 1979 ) explore feasibility acceptability cold face gel mask application ERP . iv . Physiological measure : Heart rate variability analysis perform data record Polar RS800CX heart rate monitor use H2 chest sensor . Polar monitor test standard clinical ECG equipment find suitable heart rate variability analysis ( Vanderlei et al 2008 ) . In morning study day , participant place Polar heart rate sensor chest use elastic strap . They instruct use heart rate monitor watch Polar RS800CX record heart rate press mark record button specific time procedure . At end study day , data download heart rate monitor watch 3 time interval 2 minute identify : begin condition - time 0 , begin procedure - time 15 , end condition - time 45 . Time interval screen artefact use heart rate variability analysis use standalone analysis software ( Niskanen et al 2004 ) . Variables select analysis include heart rate per minute , time domain measure ( RMSSD , NN50 ) frequency domain measure ( nLF 0.05-0.15Hz , nHF 0.15-0.04Hz , LF/HF ) . v. Data analysis : Data initially evaluate visual inspection participant individually . After , value obtain specific time interval phase average among participant evaluate visual inspection . Percentage non-overlapping data analysis perform detect statistically significant change baseline intervention phase . Pearson 's correlation use correlation analysis . 4 . Project timetable The project plan run 6-12 month depend rate recruitment participant . 5 . Expertise team Dr David Veale consultant psychiatrist Cognitive Behaviour Therapy South London Maudsley Trust Honorary Senior Lecturer Institute Psychiatry , Kings College London . Specialisms include obsessive compulsive disorder . Dr Roman Duncko , PhD ST5 trainee General Adult Psychiatry South London Maudsley Trust long-term research interest anxiety disorder autonomic nervous system function . 6 .
