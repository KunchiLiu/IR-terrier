	<brief_title>Dabrafenib Trametinib Treating Patients With Stage III-IV BRAF Mutant Melanoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival intermittent dose continuous dose dabrafenib trametinib among patient metastatic BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate frequency severity toxicity two dose schedule . II . To compare frequency severity fever &gt; = grade 1 per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) 4.0 two dosing schedule . III . To compare response rate ( complete partial response , confirm unconfirmed ) , overall survival , survival progression two dosing schedule step 2 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether acquired molecular event lead reactivation MAPK pathway common among patient continuous dose arm intermittent dose arm use circulate tumor DNA ( ctDNA ) . II . To assess prognostic association baseline biomarkers early molecular event progression free survival ( PFS ) . III . To explore potential interaction treatment arm baseline biomarkers/early molecular event PFS . IV . To bank tissue whole blood anticipation future study evaluate molecular event associate clinical benefit disease progression patient treat continuous versus intermittent dabrafenib trametinib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( CONTINUOUS DOSING ) : Patients receive dabrafenib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) trametinib PO daily ( QD ) day 1-56 . Courses repeat every 56 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( INTERMITTENT DOSING ) : Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID trametinib PO QD day 1-7 29-56 . Courses repeat every 56 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 3 year yearly 2 year .</detailed_description>
