	<brief_summary>We notice group patient present longstanding wet cough often treat asthma . The cough productive sputum frequently contain bacteria , resolve standard antibiotic treatment . A similar cough see subject smoke , exposure airbourne dust chemical condition know bronchiectasis , problem already exclude . We find prolonged treatment antibiotic call azithromycin effective use azithromycin way license currently trial evidence support use . This research evaluate clinical benefit low dose azithromycin determine effective safe treatment patient . It also involve detailed investigation patient determine whether enough common believe describe new condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open Label Trial Azithromycin Chronic Productive Cough</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We others observe cohort patient , mainly refer either poorly control asthma despite high dose treatment suspect bronchiectasis , give history chronic ( often 3 month ) productive cough improves antibiotic treatment quickly relapse . Most deny wheeze examination often transmit sound mucus large airway expiratory wheeze typical asthma . Investigations include spirometry , bronchial challenge , chest X-ray , screen immunodeficiency high resolution CT ( HRCT ) scan exclude recognise cause productive cough sputum culture often positive Haemophilus influenzae although sometimes demonstrate normal respiratory flora despite markedly purulent . Due efficacy cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis empirically try treatment low dose macrolide antibiotic 3-6 month often dramatic benefit . This however unproven unlicensed indication need thoroughly evaluate . The key objective study determine 12 week treatment patient chronic productive cough low dose azithromycin effective safe . The secondary objective study describe clinical pathological feature cohort patient present chronic productive cough ( evidence bronchiectasis , smoking-related chronic bronchitis immunodeficiency ) determine sufficiently similar justify new diagnostic label .</detailed_description>
