	<brief_summary>This research aim explore relationship presence amyloid burden cognitive performance , modulation educational level . For purpose combine Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image neuropsychological assessment acquire 3 group subject , two population-based cohort `` 3C '' `` AMIMage '' The first group include cognitively intact participant serve control , second group , subject mild cognitive impairment without memory complaint third , subject mild cognitive impairment memory complaint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influence educational level relationship disease-specific lesion development cognitive function assess , measure amyloid PET image battery neuropsychological test early stage disease , comparatively age-matched control . In addition , project explore influence cognitive complaint . It 's assumed 1 ) amyloid-PET measure age-matched control subject two cohort correlate cognitive performance ; 2 ) amyloid burden high high- low-educated subject similar cognitive impairment ; 3 ) similarly amyloid burden high subject cognitive complaint compare subject without cognitive complaint . Considering long term , clinical follow-up study participant allow investigate prognosis value amyloid load improve prediction cognitive decline disease progression .</detailed_description>
