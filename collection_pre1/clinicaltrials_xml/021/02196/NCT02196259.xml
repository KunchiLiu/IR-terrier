	<brief_summary>Functional connectivity define correlation neural activity distinct region brain . Several recent study demonstrate area low-frequency functional connectivity inherent brain tissue rest . These oscillation measure use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) appear synchronize related area brain . To date , investigator examine effect low-dose anesthesia functional connectivity . This study image human brain condition rest , low-dose anesthetic induce sedation . Quality acquire signal evaluate functional network brain examine . Of interest whether administration low-dose anesthetic disrupts functional connectivity brain , whether disruption functional connectivity responsible report analgesic antidepressant effect anesthetic . Participation study include four visit : in-person interview , initial fMRI scan , anesthesia infusion , second fMRI scan . There optional follow-up fMRI scan one week post infusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : A phencyclidine derivative develop Parke-Davis represent attempt mimic phencyclidine anesthesia without induce severe psychomimetic reaction parent compound . Initial report promise receive great enthusiasm . At high dos , drug find provide profound analgesia whilst preserve airway reflex . It induce reliable amnesia , yet could deliver simple injection . It claim time anesthetic herald new phase history anesthesia . Today , 40 year since anesthetic introduce Michigan , resurgence interest old drug . A grow number investigator study effect anesthesia human subject . There currently tremendous interest anesthesia opioid spar agent , model schizophrenia , antidepressant , N-Methyl D-Aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist complex regional pain syndrome . Functional connectivity measure low-frequency oscillation ( &lt; 0.08 Hz ) inherent brain tissue rest . These oscillation measure fMRI , appear synchronize related area brain . Although research area still infancy , study motor , auditory , visual , sensorimotor system , show functionally related area brain produce correlate low-frequency oscillation . This fascinating finding raise possibility new approach study brain function well potential tool diagnosis disease . Recent fMRI study precentral gyrus demonstrate ability functional connectivity study differentiate healthy volunteer patient multiple sclerosis . Additional research ongoing determine whether functional connectivity prove useful diagnosis early Alzheimer 's disease . Recent research functional connectivity identify region brain active rest . These region often refer `` Default-mode network '' ( DMN ) . Activity DMN increase brain rest decrease subject concentrate mental task . The first fMRI study examine functional connectivity chronic pain patient publish recent issue Journal Neuroscience . In study abnormal pattern functional connectivity see chronic pain patient . Specifically , dysfunction down-regulating DMN see . The chronic pain patient deactivate medial prefrontal cortex , amygdala , posterior cingulate cortex degree healthy control . The fMRI study examine functional connectivity major depression publish September 2007 . This study also note dysfunction DMN . Depressed subject find increased network functional connectivity subgenual cingulate cortex , thalamus , orbitofrontal cortex , precuneus . Notably , subgenual cingulate cortex location recent clinical trial suggest deep brain stimulation region may ameliorate symptom patient severe refractory depression . Interest anesthesia treatment chronic pain depression grow recent year . Although randomized trial low-dose anesthesia chronic pain patient , evidence currently available indicates effective treatment allodynia , hyperalgesia , hyperpathia . For depression , one randomize , placebo-controlled , double blind crossover study . In depression trial , robust rapid antidepressant effect find result single intravenous dose anesthesia last least week . Objective : To examine functional connectivity human brain rest anesthetic sedation use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Specific Aims/Hypotheses : 1 . Measure degree functional connectivity three study group ( healthy volunteer , chronic back pain , refractory depression ) . 2 . Analyze difference baseline functional connectivity . 3 . Measure change functional connectivity IV low-dose anesthetic sedation . 4 . Document study group difference anesthetic response . 5 . Measure correlation fMRI change therapeutic effect . Study Protocol : Participation study include four main visit optional follow-up visit . The first visit baseline interview session ass participant eligibility use structure interview . The second visit initial fMRI scan fMRI center . The third visit anesthetic infusion hospital ; management adverse event infusion monitor Post Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) personnel . The fourth visit follow-up fMRI scan fMRI center . There optional one week follow-up visit fMRI center final fMRI scan . fMRI Statistical Analysis : The image experiment analysis subject-specific data lead map correspond separate measure : rest state functional connectivity map , measure cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . Final inference make voxel level anatomically specific regions-of-interest ( ROIs ) . The voxel-based analysis perform generation summary image refer statistical parametric map ( SPMs ) represent before-infusion vs. after-infusion , , data two patient group become available , two-way ANOVA result ketamine infusion state patient diagnosis ( chronic pain refractory depression ) . The ROI-based analysis drive priori select fronto-limbic region interest generate self-reflection task , anatomical node default mode network give literature .</detailed_description>
