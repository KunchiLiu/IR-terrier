	<brief_summary>Mucopolysaccharidosis lysosomal storage disorder Hunter , Hurler , Sanfilippo syndromes . These patient genetic enzyme deficiency result inability degrade glycosaminoglycans . The glycosaminoglycans accumulate lysosome cause cell enlargement subsequent dysfunction . The accumulation occur tissue include cartilage , joint capsule , tendon lead carpal tunnel syndrome , trigger digit , various orthopaedic manifestation [ Van Heest , White ] . These child often suffer severe cognitive impairment often unable communicate pain numbness . Carpal tunnel syndrome almost always present , may become apparent symptom severe loss function occur . The current gold standard diagnosis consist electromyographic ( EMG ) nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) study sedation general anesthetic [ Khanna ] . Primary Objective : The investigator plan correlate EMG finding median nerve cross-sectional area child mucopolysaccharidosis . The investigator hypothesis ultrasonography carpal tunnel patient mucopolysaccharidosis prove effective , reliable , safe method evaluate median nerve , thus avoid need EMG study anesthesia . Secondary Objective : The investigator want determine cross-sectional area median nerve use ultrasonography cohort healthy child , age 3-12 . The investigator plan evaluate cohort healthy child determine normal cross-sectional area median nerve .</brief_summary>
