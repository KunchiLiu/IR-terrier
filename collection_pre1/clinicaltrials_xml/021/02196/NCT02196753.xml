	<brief_title>PET CT Suspected CIED Infection , Pilot Study - PET Guidance I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular implantable electronic device ( CIED ) infection complication increase incidence . The prevalence CIED infection estimate 2 % , difference author range 0.13 % 19.9 % . According European Heart Rhythm Association survey conduct high volume center prevalence CIED infection 2 % . The majority center able isolate infectious agent ≤50 % blood culture underscore difficulty find agent CIEDs infection many case . Cardiovascular implantable device infection categorize 3 group : superficial skin infection , generator pocket infection intravascular infection intact generator pocket . Although local pocket infection common clinical infection occur early implantation , positive blood culture may sign late onset intravascular infection Mortality cardiovascular implantable electronic device relate infective endocarditis treat antibiotic reach 66 % , whereas combine therapy ( antibiotic complete device removal ) 3-fold low . Prolonged target antibiotic therapy ( 4 6 week ) complete device removal revision indication re-implantation recommend case ( class I confirm diagnosis IIa probable diagnosis ) . In complicated uncertain case additional diagnostic tool need , especially take account load patient associate device removal , prolonged hospitalization re-implantation . Apart morbidity mortality , infection also associate significant financial cost patient third-party payer . Polish data issue available yet US estimate average cost combine medical surgical treatment CIED-related infection range USD 25,000 permanent pacemaker USD 50,000 implantable cardioverter-defibrillators . Positron emission tomography combine compute tomography ( PET CT ) play important role difficult case CIED-related infection publish study focus outcomes safety procedure briefly consider economical aspect diagnostic test . Recent study show PET CT scan effective precise tool facilitate diagnostic process decision make regard therapy especially difficult patient CIED-related infection . PET CT scan protect patient unnecessary device removal late removal . PET CT may also help diagnose source infection , embolic complication , neoplasm , autoimmune disease connective tissue disease . However issue concern low sensitivity connect elevated marker uptake myocardium case small vegetation , especially lead-related In study assess PET CT diagnostic process CIED related infection standard oncologic protocol use . Those protocol may optimal ass FDG uptake inflammatory cell . The aim single-center randomize control trial ass clinical usefulness positron emission tomography combine compute tomography ( PET CT ) diagnostic process suspect cardiovascular implantable electronic device ( CIED ) infection ( lead dependent infective endocarditis , generator pocket infection , fever unknown origin ) . All patient participate study undergo standard diagnostic process . Conventional/standard diagnostic therapeutic process consist : medical interview , physical examination , laboratory test , blood culture ( 3 set , 1 hour apart , repeat 24 hour -if applicable - fever peak 38°C ) ; image study ( echocardiography : transthoracic , contraindication transesophageal , case negative equivocal result repeat 7-10 day , series necessary , compute tomography scan pulmonary embolism indicate ) ; abnormality system , decision concern diagnostics make physician charge . Apart standard diagnostic procedure patient undergo whole body PET CT scan localize infection inflammation . Then investigator team make decision concern treatment ( antibiotic complete device removal v conservative treatment ) .</detailed_description>
