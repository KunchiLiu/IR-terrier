	<brief_summary>- The measurement hindfoot alignment technical challenge . - Today , hindfoot alignment typically measure hindfoot alignment view radiographs long axial view radiograph . Measurements type radiograph hamper technical shortcoming minimal rotational misplacement foot time image acquisition . In previous publication study group demonstrate substantial measurement error due shortcoming well bad interreader agreement . - Hindfoot alignment measurement feasible MR image hamper non-weight-bearing position patient therefore suit pre-treatment evaluation . - In ex vivo study use plastic phantom foot research group could demonstrate superior interreader agreement complete correction foot misplacement time image acquisition use 3D secondary measurement technique base biplanar low dose radiograph . - Image acquisition use biplanar low dose radiograph associate substantial reduction ( 1/7 ) radiation dose apply patient compare standard radiograph . - Therefore question arise excellent ex vivo result confirm prospective clinical study . Objectives : 1 . Evaluation technical feasibility 3D hindfoot alignment measurement base biplanar radiograph . 2 . Reproduction superior interreader agreement measurement base biplanar radiograph compare measurement conventional radiograph .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three-Dimensional Hindfoot Alignment Measurements Based On Biplanar Radiographs : Prospective Clinical Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Additional information brief summary : Outcome ( ) : Hindfoot alignment measurement standard radiograph biplanar radiograph . The hindfoot angle measure tibial axis calcaneal axis degree . Measurement result plain film base 3D reconstruction compare . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion : - Inclusion : All patient refer hindfoot alignment radiograph . These adult suffer severe trauma suffer osteoarthrosis ankle joint . No inclusion vulnerable participant . - Exclusion criterion : Prior surgery , prior fracture , child adolescent young age 20 year , know pregnancy . Measurements Procedures : Measurement hindfoot alignment base conventional radiograph base biplanar radiographs two independent radiologist . Comparison measurement result ( paired-t-test , Wilcoxon signed-rank test ) calculation interreader agreement ( Intraclass correlation coefficient ) . Study Product / Intervention : EOS low-dose biplanar x-ray scanner , EOS imaging , Paris , France One scan ankle joint obtain antero-posterior lateral view . Control Intervention : Conventional x-ray ankle joint ( a.p. , lateral , long axial hindfoot alignment view ) refer clinician treatment planning . Number Participants : 50 adult Based power analysis think number patient enable reliable result . Because know big difference measurement standard radiograph measurement biplanar radiograph difficult perform reasonable power analysis . In prior study compare torsion measurement biplanar radiographs CT measurement able produce reliable result number patient . Study Schedule : First-Participant-In : June 2014 Last-Participant-Out : May 2015</detailed_description>
