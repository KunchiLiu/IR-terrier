	<brief_summary>Ageing primary risk factor chronic disease include type 2 diabetes mellitus . Sarcopenia muscular mitochondrial dysfunction age crucial mechanism lead decreased exercise tolerance worsen insulin sensitivity . Thus , metabolic disease frailty , limit physical mobility well quality life , share common cellular mechanism . The investigator test hypothesis combination normobaric hypoxia exercise training elicit synergistic effect age-associated metabolic skeletal muscle dysfunction investigator address molecular mechanism . In randomized clinical study , investigator compare normoxic hypoxic training condition elderly subject . Outcome measure focus whole body insulin sensitivity mitochondrial response skeletal muscle 8-week training intervention .</brief_summary>
