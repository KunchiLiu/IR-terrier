	<brief_title>The Middle East Dual Anti-platelet Treatment Acute Transient Ischemic Attack</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transient Ischemic Attacks ( TIAs ) common , easily misdiagnosed , investigate appropriately often harbinger disable stroke . A TIA best define episode neurological dysfunction cause focal ischemia last less 24 hour ( often less hour ) . Minor stroke ( NIHSS &lt; 3 ) often lump together TIAs . The distinction minor ischemic stroke TIA unimportant term prognosis . Numerous study show short-term risk stroke high TIA minor ischemic stroke , particularly first day , even patient treat aspirin , current standard care . In patient TIAs minor stroke effective therapy significantly reduce overall burden stroke initiate immediately . The recently complete CHANCE study comprise 5000 patient TIAs minor stroke show short course combination antiplatelet medication ( ASA+clopidogrel ) 3 week significantly reduce 90-day risk stroke compare ASA treatment . There three trial patient TIAs minor stroke treat early onset symptom combination treatment clopidogrel ASA versus ASA alone . FASTER pilot trial base Canada ( 5 ) . It evaluate clopidogrel ( 300 mg load 75 mg/day afterwards ) background aspirin patient present within 24 hour TIA minor stroke . The trial enrol 392 patient . The risk stroke ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) 90 day 11 % treated aspirin alone 7 % treat clopidogrel aspirin , non-significant 36 % relative risk reduction ( RRR ) pilot trial ( p=0.19 ) . There two Intra cerebral hemorrhage ( ICHs ) patient treat clopidogrel ASA . The recently complete CHANCE trial ( 5170 patient enrol within 24 hour symptom-onset ) China show patient high-risk TIAs minor stroke , significant absolute reduction early stroke 90 day 11.7 % 8.2 % hazard ration ( HR ) 0.68 , 95 % Confidence interval ( CI ) 0.57-0.81 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) patient treat combination ASA clopidogrel 21 day compare ASA alone ( 13 ) . Similar EXPRESS study ( 3 ) , stroke develop initial day follow TIA . The observation stroke occur early , evident EXPRESS CHANCE suggest perhaps vascular pathology responsible event begin heal rapidly antiplatelet therapy initiate . This allow possibility short duration combination antiplatelet therapy may also effective 21 day treatment CHANCE 30 day treatment NIH fund POINT trial . A prospective study compare outcome stroke , MI death 90 day patient treat 10 day 30 day dual antiplatelet therapy therefore useful . If short duration dual antiplatelet therapy effective long duration dual antiplatelet treatment , result lower cost low risk side effect stroke prevention high-risk TIA patient . Hypothesis : The short duration use dual antiplatelet agent 10 day effective long duration 30 day longer . The short duration treatment however result few hemorrhagic complication . STUDY OBJECTIVES The Primary Specific Aim randomize , multicenter clinical trial determine whether 10 day course treatment clopidogrel 75 mg/day mouth load dose 600 mg effective similar treatment 30 day improve survival free ischemic vascular event ( ischemic stroke , myocardial infarction , ischemic vascular death ) 90 day subject randomize within 24 hour time last known free new ischemic symptom patient receive aspirin 50-325 mg/day long-term antiplatelet therapy . There several secondary aim study , include comparison risk major minor hemorrhage , risk recurrent TIAs minor stroke 10-day , 30-day 90-day evaluation measure severity stroke two arm 90 day follow-up . The NIHSS use assessment severity stroke . Participation Centers During course trial , approximately 10-15 site enroll approximately 1200 subject TIA minor ischemic stroke . Before enrol subject study , collaborate site obtain approval local institutional review board ( IRBs ) , access study documentation educational material . Study Population The study include TIA minor ischemic stroke . Neurological impairment time enrollment expect minimal since deficit prompt diagnosis largely resolve . Vascular risk factor , include diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease , expect common . Pregnant woman exclude study safety clopidogrel establish population , drug may increase risk harm fetus . Women risk pregnancy ( see Exclusion Criteria ) also exclude . No vulnerable population exclude study . TREATMENTS Study Drugs This randomize study primarily design compare clopidogrel/aspirin combination versus aspirin alone regimen 10 day versus 30 day . This open-label design . Patients physician aware study medication . Aspirin tablets open label dose range 50-325 mg daily determine treat physician . A dose 162 mg daily x 5 day , follow 81 mg daily strongly recommend . Clopidogrel treatment offer following manner : Day 1 : 8 tablet clopidogrel 75 mg ( load dose 600 mg ) From D2 D10 D2 D30 : one tablet clopidogrel 75 mg All patient ASA 50-325 90 day final assessment . Assignment Treatment Group The randomization take place locally . To keep study simple , sequential subject randomize 10 day ( even number recruitment ) 30 day ( odd number recruitment ) . All center recruit competitively trial .</detailed_description>
