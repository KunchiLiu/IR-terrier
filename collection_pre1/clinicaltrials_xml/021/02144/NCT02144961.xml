	<brief_title>The Effects Indocyanine Green Angiography ( IGA ) Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator ( DIEP ) Flap Design Post-Operative Fat Necrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For many post-mastectomy cancer patient seek breast reconstruction , microsurgical , autologous tissue transfer desirable alternative conventional , implant-based procedure . In general term , technique entail use one 's tissue , transfer distant anatomic site , recreate absent breast . This tissue , usually composite skin subcutaneous adipose tissue , isolate along source artery vein , transfer chest wall connect ( anastomose ) local blood supply . Though many donor tissue ( flap ) describe purpose , abdominal tissue supply small , perforate blood vessel originate deep inferior epigastric artery , become microsurgical gold standard . This so-called DIEP flap provide abundant tissue easily sculpt fill breast defect minimal donor site morbidity . Like microvascular , free tissue transfer , however , DIEP flap without potential complication . One potential complication distress patient occurs portion subcutaneous adipose tissue transfer exceeds available blood supply . This devascularized fat eventually undergoes necrosis may complicate interpretation future mammogram , may result palpable , painful , occasionally visible , irregularity within transfer tissue . Though many techniques/interventions/technologies describe minimize incidence fat necrosis , occurrence remain frustratingly unpredictable relatively common , publish rate range 6 17 % . In theory , maximize perfusion composite tissue flap minimize rate fat necrosis . As , many technique emerge DIEP flap surgery intend maximize perfusion . One common technique use pre-operative , CT angiography ( CTA ) identify large anatomically favorable perforating vessel include composite tissue transfer . Though elegant simplicity , use technique never demonstrate decrease rate fat necrosis DIEP reconstruction . In recent year , however , another technology intend intra-operatively evaluate tissue perfusion emerge may prove beneficial realm microvascular free tissue transfer- Indocyanine green angiography ( IGA ) . IGA refer peripheral venous injection lyophilize indocyanine green , contrast agent fluoresces excite laser specific wavelength A charge-coupled camera , hold tissue interest , detect stimulate fluorescence project image `` real-time '' tissue perfusion proportional emission intensity . The application IGA technology reconstructive plastic surgery , discipline relies largely immediate accurate assessment tissue perfusion , recently generate much discussion . We believe perforator selection DIEP breast reconstruction , process traditionally dictate institution pre-operative CTA , may heavily influence intra-operative IGA . We hypothesize use intra-operative IGA DIEP breast reconstruction may reduce incidence post-operative fat necrosis . The aim study prospectively evaluate effect intra-operative Indocyanine Green Angiography ( IGA ) flap design rate post-operative fat necrosis patient undergo autologous breast reconstruction utilize Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator ( DIEP ) flap .</detailed_description>
