	<brief_summary>During last decade , owe grow tendency woman delay childbearing plan career personal priority , fertility specialist today see woman poor ovarian reserve poor ovarian response Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ( COH ) consider important factor success vitro fertilization-embryo transfer ( IVF-ET ) , enable recruitment multiple oocyte , thereby , result one embryo . However , owe extreme variability ovarian response COH , subgroup patient poor ovarian response , method may yield small number follicle After succeed maximal recruitment follicle , trigger ovulation extremely important order achieve , many , mature oocyte . Several study report retrieval mature oocytes GnRH agonist trigger compare number oocytes retrieved hCG . Among possible advantage GnRH agonist final oocyte maturation simultaneous induction FSH surge . The role natural mid-cycle FSH surge fully clear . FSH report induce LH receptor formation luteinizing granulosa cell , promote oocyte nuclear maturation cumulus expansion . Another method describe trigger ovulation `` Dual triggering '' - GnRH agonist 40 h prior ovum pickup hCG add 6 h first trigger . The dual triggering describe treatment case recurrent empty follicle . The aim present study evaluate three different method ovulation trigger woman poor ovarian response</brief_summary>
