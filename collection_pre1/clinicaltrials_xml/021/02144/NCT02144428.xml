	<brief_summary>The management child confirm cow 's milk allergy base complete avoidance cow 's milk proteins leave physician several dietary option , none , give prevalence , spectrum potential seriousness condition , recommend patient . In absence alternative cow 's milk , management cow 's milk allergy base use safe , affordable nutritionally adequate formula . Extensively hydrolyze cow 's milk protein formula , consider safe child cow 's milk allergy , still liable contain residual peptide , hypersensitivity reaction may occur infant allergic cow 's milk protein . Thus , specific product allergenicity must address individual basis recommend formula substitute cow 's milk . Soy-based formula also concomitant sensitize cow 's milk allergy child soy . Amino acid-based formula study safety nutritional efficacy perspective . These formula propose subject highly sensitive cow 's milk protein manage use extensively hydolyzed formula child multiple food allergy . In condition aminoacid base formula able effectively cure allergic symptom improve body growth .</brief_summary>
