	<brief_title>Efficacy Early Short-term Training Thrombogenesis Patients Following Coronary Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction The American College Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline suggest cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) offer eligible patient coronary bypass surgery ( CABG ) . [ 1 ] However , CR use America relatively low among Medicare beneficiary despite convince evidence benefit recommendation use professional organization . [ 2 ] This neglect well evident Taiwan . Traffic inconvenience unavailability due working hour common cause . There way mend situation . One develop early , intensive short-term CR program . The current investigation adopt early , intensive supervise train male patient follow elective CABG due old myocardial infarction and/or angina pectoris . Meta-analyses randomize controlled trial consistently show participation CR program improve mortality morbidity outcomes . It also benefit cardiopulmonary fitness , quality life , lipid profile , etc . [ 3 ] Nonetheless , research regard effect balance thrombogenesis rest response vigorous exercise either incomplete controversial . Previous study find acute physical exertion may trigger acute coronary syndrome . The relative risk cardiac event 2-6 time higher strenuous physical exertion ( &gt; 6 METs ) compare mild moderate intensity activity cardiac patient . [ 4 ] One possible explanation acute physical exertion may acutely change hemostatic milieu favor increased coagulation activation platelet . [ 5 ] Available evidence suggest strenuous exercise , healthy subject various cardiovascular disease state , associate activation platelet blood coagulation , lead prothrombotic hypercoagulable state . [ 6 , 7 ] Aspirin ineffective attenuating enhance platelet aggregation activation induce exercise . [ 8 ] Regular physical exercise associate overall reduce risk primary cardiac arrest . [ 4 ] D Wosornu et al . show three-month aerobic training program ( 3 session per week ) decrease rest fibrinogen concentration . [ 9 ] A meta-analysis show exercise intervention 2 week associate reduced inflammatory activity patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . C-reactive protein fibrinogen provide strong evidence . [ 10 ] Platelet activation strenuous exercise study 12 physically active 12 sedentary individual standardize treadmill exercise test . Among sedentary subject , exercise cause augmentation platelet activation reactivity . In contrast , physically active subject exercise fail induce alteration platelet activation state . [ 11 ] Our previous study identify moderate-intensity exercise training ( 60 % maximal oxygen consumption 30 min per day , 5 days/week 8 week ) reduce rest strenuous exercise-induced platelet aggregation platelet adhesion shear flow healthy men , [ 12 ] accompany decrease vWF bind platelet expression P-selectin platelet . [ 13 ] Accordingly , main research question whether short-term CR program current investigation ameliorate hemostatic imbalance rest platelet coagulation activation maximal stress exercise . This prospective randomized control study . Sixty men schedule receive elective CABG Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Linkuo enrol study . They randomize two group : intensive training ( IT ) usual rehabilitation ( UR ) . Participants IT group receive education , recondition exercise early intensive aerobic training moderate intensity CABG . A submaximal exercise test perform prescription . They receive two training session per day least 22 session total . The CR group receive usual CR program . After intervention , participant receive maximal exercise test . In addition , six-minute walk test , generic disease-specific quality life collect rehabilitation . Additional 20 age-matched , non-sedentary healthy participant without train recruit control group . Venous blood sample three time ( rehabilitation maximal stress test ) assessment platelet activation flow cytometer hemorheological profile coagulation analyzer . Mean platelet volume , platelet activation marker ( platelet-bound CD62P % G , CD63 % G , CD40L % G ) analyze . Various coagulation fibrinolysis factor quantify include PT , aPTT , fibrinogen , thrombin time , FVIII : C , antithrombin , plasminogen , antiplasmin , anti-Xa thrombin generation , D-Dimer , vWF etc . We hypothesize train program ameliorate prothrombotic state attenuate platelet reactivity coagulation induce strenuous exercise patient CABG . Hopefully , clinical investigation establish early short-term rehabilitation model follow CABG efficacy clinical use . Methodology Participants A prospective study perform within Cardiovascular Ward Chang Gung Memorial Hospital , Linkuo . The inclusion criterion diagnose CAD schedule receive elective CABG . Patients await first-time elective CABG invite participate study , enrol give write informed consent . Sixty patient enrol . Exclusion criterion musculoskeletal neurological impairment preclude performance cycling walk assessment , atrial fibrillation , receive anticoagulation therapy , inability complete questionnaire , plan concomitant surgery , clinical status require emergent CABG . Additional 20 non-sedentary , age-matched healthy subject without cardiovascular illness recruit control group . Non-sedentary life style define walk 25 minute average per day accord National Population Health Surveys Canada . [ 14 ] Randomization The patient randomize two treatment group ( see Table 1 ) follow assessment study eligibility prior initial physiotherapy assessment . Randomization perform mean random number generator base medical chart number . Thirty patient allocate receive usual rehabilitation ( UR ) ; 30 intensive training ( IT ) . Intervention protocol Physiotherapy intervention receive two study group document Table 1 . The IT group receive physiotherapy twice daily long duration high intensity . After postoperative day5th , train intensity prescribe ventilatory anaerobic threshold ( VAT ) base submaximal exercise test end point supra-VAT . All physiotherapy intervention undertake one physiotherapist , specifically trained education treatment method use study . [ 15-17 ] Supplemental oxygen use supervised/assisted walk rest oxygen saturation &lt; 92 % . If patient sinus tachycardia ( define &gt; 120 beats/min rest ) without hemodynamic compromise , exercise undertaken `` comfortable '' pace rather `` moderate '' `` somewhat strong '' level perceive exertion . Patients counsel walk training outside physiotherapy session . All patient receive outcome assessment include cardiopulmonary exercise test , 6-minute-walk , quality life , hemorheological profile basal strenuous exercise ( Figure 1 ) .</detailed_description>
