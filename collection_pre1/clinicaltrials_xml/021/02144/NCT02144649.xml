	<brief_title>Tangerine Red Tomato Juice Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct randomize , three-arm pilot clinical trial determine compliance safety daily consumption tangerine tomato juice red tomato juice . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To quantify total carotenoid , total lycopene ( LYC ) , cis-LYC , trans-LYC , phytoene , phytofluene , lycopene metabolite plasma prostate tissue three group men . II . To evaluate serum biomarkers related prostate carcinogenesis , include previously impact tomato phytochemical ( testosterone , sex hormone-binding protein [ SHBP ] , insulin-like growth factor [ IGF ] -I , IGF-binding protein [ BP ] 3 , vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , panel anti-inflammatory cytokine ) validate assay . III . To evaluate molecular signature use 200 gene quantitative Nano-string nCounter code set ( select gene know impacted dietary component , gene impact common prostate genetic epigenetic damage , regulate testosterone ) micro-ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) nCounter code set . IV . To plot distribution carotenoid metabolites across matrix versus epithelium cancer versus non-cancer area prostate use matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization ( MALDI ) imaging limited number sample . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment group . GROUP I : Patients consume tomato juice . GROUP II : Patients consume two can tangerine tomato juice daily schedule surgery ( approximately 4 week ) . GROUP III : Patients consume two can red tomato juice daily schedule surgery ( approximately 4 week ) .</detailed_description>
