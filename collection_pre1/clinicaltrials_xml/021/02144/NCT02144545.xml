	<brief_summary>Morbid Obesity ( MO ) consider important epidemic develop world twenty-first century . After initial assessment morbidly obese patient exclusion potentially correctable cause , management involve combination dietary change , cognitive therapy , physical activity , psychological support pharmacological treatment . However , combination factor proven long-term effectiveness achieve significant sustain reduction excess weight . Currently , surgery treatment capable achieve goal , interact also significant improvement quality life overall long-term mortality . In recent year , several author report excellent short-term result perform sleeve gastrectomy , whether aspect regard variability gastric tubulization design could influence result obtain relation weight loss functional change gastric hormone . The main objective study assess size gastric tubulization ( base probe calibration distance pylorus initiate gastric section ) provide good clinical outcome ( excess weight loss ) patient undergo surgery morbid obesity . Secondary objective assess morphological change , physiological hormonal obtain accord size gastric tubulization effect weight loss patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Size Gastric Sleeve Weight Loss . Correlation With Gastric Function Endocrine-metabolic Changes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS Surgical major factor determine size gastric pouch perform sleeve gastrectomy diameter remanent stomach ( influenced diameter bougie size ) residual antrum . Whereas gastrectomy restrictive procedure , postulate variation factor significant impact clinical outcome term weight loss improvement comorbidities addition possible change hormone pattern OBJECTIVE : - Primary Outcome Measure : Weight loss one year surgery - Secondary Outcome Measures : - Morphological change induce size gastric tubulization - Gastric antrum volume - Gastric body volume - Correlation gastric volume weight loss - Gastric empty - Hormone level ( surgery ) relation weight loss - Quality life DATA TO ANALIZE We analyze follow key variable : - BMI ( body mass index ) - Preoperative gastric volume - Postoperative gastric volume . An evaluation variation data two stage ( one month one year surgery ) patient group comparison make group . Secondary variable analyze : - Gastric emptying , analyze relation baseline ( preoperative ) - Lower esophageal sphincter pressure - The number episodes gastroesophageal reflux , number reflux episodes long 5 minute , percentage time pH 4 - Plasma hormone list An evaluation temporary modification variable month year surgery relation preoperative value patient group comparison make four group . - Gastric volume study Methodology For evaluation patient abdominal CT scan multislice device perform . Diluted oral contrast administer 3 % ( amidotrizoate meglumine , sodium amidotrizoate Gastrografin ® ) maximum distension stomach gastric remnant order assess gastric volume remnant . Cuts make within 45 minute ingestion oral contrast perform CT without intravenous contrast supine , include tracheal carina pubic symphysis . Cuts initiate diaphragmatic hiatus carina level , order evaluate possible migration flow gastric remnant report recent publication type surgery . All case must supervise radiologist part study team validate image obtain purpose high quality 3D processing . Validate optimal degree gastric distension . The data collect stored DICOM format manipulation 3D . The study protocol provide realization three CT scan : 1 . Preoperative CT Be assess maximum gastric volume height esophagogastric junction order quantify possible migration . 2 . CT one month surgery Possible quantify volume gastric remnant ass whether increased volume . This data would adjust actual volume remnant apply 3D model . Assess whether cranial migration esophagogastric junction gastric late postoperative complication . Will correlate weight loss . 3 . CT one year surgery Rating final state stomach , final quantification residual volume correlation final weight loss . Final assessment possible complication gastric migration . - Scintigraphic evaluation Methodology 1 . Patient preparation It important patient 12 hour fast , ensure stomach empty . In addition , patient may smoke take medication could interfere gastric motility . In diabetic patient , CT scan wil perform first thing morning , injection insulin . 2 . Radiopharmaceutical To get information single tracer , best mark solid component . With solid , addition assess antral motility measure indirectly state gastric tone , crush empty . For , 50 g huevina beat 1 mCi ( 37 MBq ) 99m Tc-sulfur colloid immediately cook tortilla . 3 . Gamma camera Dual-head low-energy collimator medium resolution ( LEAP ) 4 . Procedure Immediately ingest food ( le 10 minute ) , proceed detect stomach patient stand . Among various detection , patient remain seat . Will immediately perform baseline image subsequently post-ingestion , anterior posterior view 2 minute duration every 15 minute two hour . 5 . Processed ROI drawn gastric area , except first image include activity , even intestinal . The software determine gastric account every time projection ( anterior posterior ) geometric mean ( Qty * Cpost ) . Also determine point residual percentage compare initial activity . Time There temporary sequence radiological evaluation : preoperative postoperative assessment one month year - Functional esophagogastric evaluation Methodology Esophageal manometry pH monitoring perform patient include study . The test carry Digestive Pathology Service Hospital Santa Creu Sant Pau . Esophageal manometry catheter make polyvinyl four hole space 5 inch . The distal end connect external pressure transducer electrical signal process analyzed computer program ( PC Polygraf , Synectics Medical ) . It take eight hour prior fast , previously suspend medication may alter esophageal motility modify stomach acid secretion . The catheter insert mouth four channel reach stomach . Recording intra- gastric pressure end expiration use reference . The manometric evaluation lower esophageal sphincter perform slow withdrawal . Record resting pressure , length , location relative nasal ala relaxation post swallow . Esophageal motor activity ( amplitude duration wave , peristaltic wave percentage simultaneous post swallow ) , evaluate slowly withdraw conduct least 10 swallow 3-5 cc water every 20 second . Finally , evaluate upper esophageal sphincter activity . Pharyngeal pressure record , rest pressure upper esophageal sphincter pharyngo - esophageal coordination upper esophageal sphincter relaxation dry liquid swallow every 20 second . After esophageal manometry pH monitoring perform . Using single-use probe 2 channel . We introduce probe pH monitor nose reach lower esophageal sphincter ( reference location lower esophageal sphincter manometry find ) . Probe remove , leave 5 cm low esophageal sphincter . The patient instruct perform usual daily activity , symptom diary recording . The probe connect Holter apparatus record 24 number reflows , measure duration minute duration long reflux episode , percentage time esophageal pH less 4 . All measurement record proximal distal esophagus . After 24 hour tube remove information process computer program ( PC Polygraf , Synectics Medical ) . Time The evaluation conduct three stage : pre-and postoperative assessment ( within 2 day , 3 month one year ) . - Hormonal glucose metabolism It carry follow hormonal determination : • Insulin • Glucagon • GLP-1 • GIP • Ghrelin • Leptin • Adiponectin • Peptide YY Methodology Blood sample make week surgery ( Day Hospital Endocrinology ) , admission ward General Surgery ( 2nd postoperative day ) 3 month one year surgery ( Day Hospital Endocrinology ) . To end , patient place peripheral vein upper extremity . • The first draw fasting . Ten minute later , give standard meal proceed extraction blood sample follow time : - end intake - postprandial sample ( 20 , 60 120 respectively ) . Times : The determination carry : - one week surgery - postoperative day 2 - year</detailed_description>
