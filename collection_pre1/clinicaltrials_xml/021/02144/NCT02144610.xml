	<detailed_description>This double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , phase 3 , multinational , multicenter study AMG0001 ( HGF plasmid ) subject Critical Limb Ischemia ( CLI ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects CLI ( Severe Rutherford 4 Rutherford 5 ) : No option revascularization endovascular intervention surgical bypass Poor option ( high risk ) revascularization surgery option endovascular intervention ( see Section 3.1 Study Population full definition appropriate inclusion ) . 2 . Subjects 4090 year either gender sign informed consent form either directly legally authorize representative . 3 . Subjects currently take statin antiplatelet agent ( e.g. , clopidogrel , ticlopidine , aspirin , etc . ) 2 week prior Day 0 part standard care , unless contraindicate . Subjects agent contraindicate reason contraindication record case report form ( CRF ) . 4 . If female , subject must child bear potential , e.g. , postmenopausal surgically sterile . 5 . If male subject reproductive potential , must agree use accepted effective ( barrier ) form birth control start first dose study product continue 12 week last dose study product . This apply course treatment . 6 . Subjects previous medical history myocardial infarction and/or stroke adequate management risk factor prevent secondary occurrence . ( See Section 4.2 Medical History guideline appropriate secondary prevention . ) 7 . Subjects ability understand requirement protocol agree return require study visit , assessment follow . The index leg leg great severity CLI disease . Entry requirement apply index leg . The index leg may also refer treated leg affect leg text protocol study document . If subject two leg Rutherford classification ( severe Rutherford 4 Rutherford 5 ) eligible treatment , leg great disease severity ( base extensive necrosis extensive/deeper ulceration ( ) , difference ABI TBI ≥ 0.1 , and/or extensive vascular disease base angiogram ) chosen index leg . If clinical , hemodynamic angiographic evidence determine leg great disease severity , subject exclude study . These entry criterion enforce ( prior randomization ) Sponsor , well Entry Committee review relevant clinical data include limited medical illness , CLI status , finding angiogram , ulcer photograph measurement hemodynamic data . 1 . Subjects whose CLI status unstable ( spontaneous mark improvement mark worsen screen period ) excessive tissue necrosis unlikely benefit medication , poor option subject require immediate revascularization surgery . Stability CLI status confirm Principal Investigator prior randomization retrospectively review Adjudication Committee . 2 . Subjects may require major amputation ( amputation ankle ) within 4 week Day 0 ( ± 4 week Day 0 ) . 3 . Subjects ulcers exposure tendon , osteomyelitis uncontrolled infection large ulcer great 20 cm2 area ( &gt; 10 cm2 area heel ) . 4 . Subjects purely neuropathic , venous ulcer . 5 . Subjects Rutherford 6 class . 6 . Subjects revascularization surgery angioplasty within 3 month , unless procedure fail base anatomy hemodynamic measurement . 7 . Subjects diagnosis Buerger 's disease ( Thromboangiitis Obliterans ) . 8 . Subjects currently receive immunosuppressive , chemo radiation therapy . 9 . Evidence history malignant neoplasm ( clinical , laboratory imaging ) except successfully excise basal cell squamous cell carcinoma , successfully excise early melanoma skin . Subjects , successful tumor resection radiochemotherapy breast cancer 10 year prior inclusion study , recurrence , may enrol study . Subjects , successful tumor resection radiochemotherapy tumor type remission 5 year prior inclusion study , recurrence , may enrol study . A dermatological exam rule skin cancer . 10 . Subjects proliferative retinopathy , moderate severe nonproliferative retinopathy , cause ( ETDRS Score &gt; 35 ) , clinically significant macular oedema previous panretinal photocoagulation therapy ( Results Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study . Ophthalmology May 1991 Supplement 98 : 823833 ) . 11 . Females childbearing potential defined subject surgically sterile postmenopausal . 12 . Subjects severe renal disease define significant renal dysfunction evidence estimate creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/minute ( calculate use Cockroft Gault formula ) , receive chronic hemodialysis therapy . 13 . Any comorbid condition likely interfere assessment safety efficacy endpoint , acute cardiovascular event ( i.e. , CVA , MI , etc . ) within 3 month treatment , disease opinion Investigator may result subject mortality le 3 month . 14 . Subjects know liver disease ( e.g. , hepatitis B C cirrhosis liver ) . 15 . A subject HIV , AIDS , severe uncontrolled inflammatory disease severe uncontrolled autoimmune disease ( e.g. , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , etc ) . 16 . Subjects significant psychiatric disorder mental disability could interfere subject 's ability provide inform consent comply study procedure . 17 . Subjects current , uncorrected history alcohol substance abuse . 18 . Diabetic subject uncorrected HbA1c &gt; 9.0 % screening period . 19 . Subjects administer rhPDGF ( e.g , becaplermin ) growth factor locally within one month randomization . 20 . Subjects receive another investigational drug within 30 day randomization previously receive gene transfer therapy within 3 year enter study .</criteria>
