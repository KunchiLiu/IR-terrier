	<detailed_description>This first time man ( FTIM ) , Phase I study determine Maxiimum Tolerated Dose , Recommended Phase 2 Dose , safety , tolerability Pharmacokinetics AZD5312 . This multicentre study site United States United Kingdom . Approximately 90 patient expect enrol study.The study involve two part , Part A , Dose Escalation Part B , Dose Expansion . AZD5312 give intravenously ( IV ) infusion , one hour . For purpose planning , 4 week period ( 28 day ) call Cycle . AZD5312 initially administer 4 time within first 11 day , ( Days [ 1 , 4 , 8 11 ] ± 2 ) , dose sequential day . Patients receive weekly treatment Days 15 22 complete Cycle . 1 . During subsequent cycle , patient receive weekly treatment Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 ( ±2 ) . The AZD5312 dose change unless dose reduction require due treatment-related toxicity . Patients continue receive AZD5312 disease progression , intolerable toxicity , discontinuation criterion meet . Toxicity , Pharmacokinetics biomarker data assess throughout study . Alternative infusion duration and/or treatment schedule may explore preliminary data suggest would appropriate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion . Patient must understand nature trial provide sign date , write informed consent form prior study specific procedure , sample analysis . If patient decline participate voluntary exploratory research and/or genetic component study , penalty loss benefit patient he/she exclude aspect study . Part A Dose Escalation Patients must histological cytological confirmation solid tumour either locally advanced metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , breast , bladder , ovarian , gastric salivary duct carcinoma Androgen Receptor pathway may potential factor . Part B Dose Expansion . Patient must understand nature trial provide sign date , write informed consent form prior study specific procedure , sample analysis . Part A Dose Escalation Patients must histological cytological confirmation solid tumour either locally advanced metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) , breast , bladder , ovarian , gastric salivary duct carcinoma Androgen Receptor pathway may potential factor . Part B Dose Expansion Arm 1 2 patient must histological cytological confirmation locally advance metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer progressive disease time entry demonstrate either Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ( measurable disease ) two subsequently increase Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) value obtain least one week apart . Arm 3 include nonmCRPC patient . The patient population dose expansion phase follow : Arm 1 Prostate cancer patient prior second generation antihormonal therapy ( example : abiraterone , enzalutamide , TAK 700 ) without response ( disease progression ≤4 month Stable Disease ( SD ) Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) level decline ≥50 % ) . Arm 2 Prostate cancer patient intial response second generation antihormonal therapy ( example : abiraterone , enzalutamide , TAK 700 ) , later relapse . Disease relapse would define progressive disease time entry demonstrate either Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 ( measurable disease ) two subsequently increase Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) value obtain least one week apart . If clinically meaningful benefit identify nonmCRPC patient population escalation phase , potential third expansion arm may consider . Arm 3 Patients nonmCRPC type solid tumour locally advance metastatic breast , bladder , ovarian , gastric salivary duct carcinoma .
