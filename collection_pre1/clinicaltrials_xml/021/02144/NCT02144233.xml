	<detailed_description>- The cause temporomandibular joint ( TMJ ) disorder ( TMD ) remain unknown therapy usually empirical . Systematic review conclude currently evidence occlusal adjustment therapeutic preventive effect temporomandibular disorder . However , review also indicate evidence contrary provide research need elucidate whether benefit occlusal adjustment treatment TMD . The risk factor chronic unilateral TMD include steep condylar path , flat lateral anterior guidance , habitual chewing affect side . Consequently , new occlusal therapy propose restore physiological jaw closure masticatory function . - The primary end point trial ass efficacy new occlusal therapy affect side TMD pain , maximum mouth opening . Efficacy demonstrate show significantly superior pain relief increase maximum mouth opening ( limited ) active treatment compare placebo . Phase III , single center , randomize , parallel-group , single-blind blind assessment , placebo-controlled clinical trial . - A linear mixed model perform comparison variable logistic regression model use measure probability/risk change chew side baseline six month ; addition , McNemar 's test may use . - Interim analysis plan stop rule . The study employ interim analysis plan single interim analysis 70 % participant complete six-month follow-up visit . Using Lan-DeMets version O'Brien-Fleming stopping rule , critical value statistical significance interim analysis ( intention-to-treat approach ) +2.438 , correspond nominal two-sided P value 0.0146 . Participants remain significant pain ( and/or limit mouth open ) study invite follow conventional treatment , `` complete '' occlusal adjustment ( rescue therapy ) : full adjustment ( placebo ) , refine ( receive real therapy ) ; kind receive therapy disclose participant . It base researcher ' conviction , participant encourage receive electively `` complete '' occlusal adjustment . All participant reevaluate 3 6 month study ( 12-Mo follow-up ) . Although pain report 6-Mo follow-up , pain return , approach carry . Two session occlusal adjustment carry , pain remains , patient treat follow CHUAC approach . The evolution patient post-MAP period , write manuscript , report manuscript , even MAP result early stopped . Aditional patient 's monitoring next five year treatment expect .</detailed_description>
