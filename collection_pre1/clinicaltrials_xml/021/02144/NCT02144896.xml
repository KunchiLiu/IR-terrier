	<brief_summary>Endothelial function skeletal muscle vasculature decline advance age . Although aerobic exercise training commonly prescribe combat loss endothelial function elderly , rate compliance training program low . Contrary aerobic exercise training , stretch exercise widely perform elderly patient increase muscle flexibility prevent muscle atrophy induced immobilization . However , remain unknown whether regular stretch calf muscle use ankle dorsiflexion splint improves muscle blood flow . The purpose propose work test hypothesis performance ankle dorsiflexion splint improves endothelial function lower leg muscle blood flow old adult . Ankle dorsiflexion splint perform randomized leg 30 minute , 5 time per week 4 week . Leg vascular measure perform splint non-splinted leg prior end 4-week intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Older adult recruit study . Vascular function assess 4-week ankle splint intervention . To examine acute effect splint , vascular measure also obtain immediately follow 30 min ankle splint . All procedure perform Integrative Cardiovascular Physiology Laboratory University Florida . Participants one leg randomly assign use splint stretch calf muscle 30 min per day , 5 day per week 4 week , contralateral non-splinted leg serve internal control .</detailed_description>
