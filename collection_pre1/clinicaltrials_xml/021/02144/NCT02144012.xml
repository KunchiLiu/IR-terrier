	<brief_summary>This Phase III , randomize , multicenter , multinational , two-arm , open-label clinical trial investigate first-line treatment participant human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER2 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer . The study enroll patient HER2-positive , unresectable , locally advanced breast cancer ( BC ) recurrent disease progressive disease ( PD ) despite primary multi-modality therapy , and/or metastatic BC receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . Eligible participant approximately 40 site Asia-Pacific region randomize 2:1 ratio receive trastuzumab emtansine ( Arm A ) trastuzumab plus docetaxel ( Arm B ) . All study drug administer in-clinic visit occur every three week treatment phase . Trastuzumab plus docetaxel chosen comparator control group ( Arm B ) , represent common first-line treatment option use patient population China Asia-Pacific country .</brief_summary>
