	<detailed_description>Recurrent common bile duct stone one risk factor recurrent cholangitis . However , exact pathophysiology mechanism recurrent cholangitis establish . Periampullary diverticulum narrow angle common bile duct postulate risk factor recurrent common bile duct stone . The aim study evaluate association periampullary dierticulum , angle common bile duct recurrent common bile duct stone . This study patient-control set study . Firstly , July 2007 February 2014 , patient perform ERCP enrol . The inclusion criterion patient common bile duct stone . The exclusion criterion patient biliary stenosis , PSC , retain GB stone , lose follow-up . The main outcome association periampullary diverticulum , common bile duct angle , recurrent CBD stone . This evaluated univariate multivariate analysis .</detailed_description>
