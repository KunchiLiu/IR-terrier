	<brief_summary>Some surgical procedure require general anesthesia ( i.e. , patient 'asleep ' ) . When general anesthesia , patient ' airway must manage ensure continuous flow oxygen lung , case , delivery anesthetic gas lung . Most often airway management general anesthesia , plastic breathing tube place though voicebox ( `` larynx '' ) windpipe ( `` trachea '' ) , process know `` tracheal intubation '' . To safely intubate , larynx must first expose . In many case , achieve use device know direct laryngoscope , like curve , light tongue depressor . It use gently move tongue way , expose larynx . When larynx easily see , pass breathe tube usually also easy . Unfortunately , 2-5 % case , difficult impossible view larynx use direct laryngoscope . This create difficulty tube passage . A number option exist deal situation , include , within last 10 year , class device call `` video laryngoscope '' . These device use small video chip locate towards end blade , , provide transmission image larynx 'around corner ' screen outside patient , enable view obtain ( view could obtain direct laryngoscope ) . With larynx indirectly visualize , tube passage proceed . However , 's easy . When use 'around corner ' videolaryngoscopes , tube passage difficult , tube must guide around 90 degree bend mouth trachea , sits right angle mouth . Less difficulty occur tube passage direct laryngoscope use blade compress tongue way , create straight line teeth larynx windpipe beyond . The GlideScope one example video laryngoscope , use CDHA 10 year . It extensively study ten year , 300 study appear literature . The investigator know study effective deliver view larynx direct laryngoscopy fail . However , get tube larynx trachea , even good view , problematic . Furthermore , impression clinician close-up , full view larynx obtain ( optimal direct laryngoscopy ) GlideScope , tube passage appear little difficult seem case partial view larynx obtain , little away . The investigator n't know may , may relate one number reason , include ( close ) angle larynx unfavorable angle , ( away ) favorably reduce angle mouth larynx trachea . However , guidance question appear peer-reviewed medical literature , study do . There suggestion non peer-reviewed internet sit airway management partial view may better , , scientifically study validate one way another . As mentioned , GlideScope regular use CDHA many year . Most often , use difficulty tracheal intubation anticipate already encounter anesthetized patient , although airway expert suggest within near future , intubation occur sort video laryngoscope . It important research present question contemporary practice many anesthesiologist , face patient anticipate difficult direct laryngoscopy proceed put patient sleep , rely video laryngoscope enable intubate . With patient anesthetized breathing , trouble intubate patient spite get view larynx , harm could occur patient failed intubation situation . Furthermore , number study document patient morbidity increase multiple intubation attempt .</brief_summary>
