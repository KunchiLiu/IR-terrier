	<brief_summary>The major hypothesis explain drug resistance overexpression p-glycoprotein target lesion . Based several study , p-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) important role neurologic disease , especially drug resistant epilepsy . But surrogate marker quantify expression P-gp difficulty measure substance neurologic system lack clinical trial . Here , investigator use novel non-invasive [ 11C ] -verapamil Brain PET SPAM analytic method surrogate marker quantify expression p-glycoprotein .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pilot study healthy volunteer case-control study patient drug resistant epilepsy drug sensitive epilepsy perform . The investigator compare whole brain SUV group ( normal control , drug resistant epilepsy , drug sensitive epilepsy ) asymmetry standardize uptake value ( SUV ) ipsilateral area contralateral area . [ 11C ] -verapamil PET use surrogate marker P-gp expression patient epilepsy , important prognostic factor individualized drug therapy . Also , use biomarker check drug efficacy novel medication . Furthermore , localize epileptogenic zone patient , [ 11C ] -verapamil PET could contribute improve prognosis surgical treatment drug resistant epilepsy .</detailed_description>
