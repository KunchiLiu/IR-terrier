	<brief_summary>Unlike healthy control skin , skin patient atopic dermatitis ( AD ) frequently colonize Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) , put patient increase risk S. aureus skin infection . In addition , research investigator 's lab show patient fewer protective Staphylococcal specie Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) know produce antimicrobial peptide play role protect skin invading pathogen . In study , study team attempt decrease S. aureus colonization increase colonization protective Staph specie AD patient first culture bacteria subject ' lesional AD skin . The study team selectively grow subject 's protective Staph colony place moisturizer . The first part study determine half-life bacteria-containing moisturizer . The bacteria-containing moisturizer apply subject 's arm , subject return four different time point next three day skin swabs arm use determine amount type bacteria arm time point . In second part study , subject apply moisturizer contain antimicrobial bacteria one arm total 6 time frequency determine half-life , compute end first part experiment . The subject return prior 7th application time point skin swab arm ensure still viable bacteria moisturizer present arm . In third part study , subject receive moisturizer well moisturizer plus antimicrobial bacteria . The subject apply moisturizer one arm moisturizer plus bacteria arm daily total 15 day . Subjects return clinic every 5 day skin swabs clinical evaluation . If moisturizer contain bacteria able decrease S. aureus colonization subject 's arm , study team hypothesize subject improvement AD symptom .</brief_summary>
